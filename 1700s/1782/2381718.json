Any Deed under seal, when proved, is proper to be given in evidence. 6 Mod. 45. And, we are of opinion, that a Deed, the execution of which is sworn to by one witness before a magistrate, who certifies the same, is within the rule. Besides, the last Act of Assembly certainly allows the proof of one witness to be sufficient.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  This Cause was tried at Lancaster, N.P. on the 18th May 1781, before M`KEAN, C.J.
