Abr. 611. one merchant may bind his partner, by accepting a bill drawn on both. If, then, in substance, the act of one obliges the other, what difference arises from the circumstance of the delivery not being formally executed? That question was agitated in the case of McKim vs. McFarlan: there Levinz indorsed a note of McFarlan's to McKim; but being indebted to McFarlan, he thought it proper to give him previous notice of the transaction, and, accordingly, threw the note into his desk with that design. During his absence, McKim, who had given a valuable consideration for the note, persuaded Mrs. Levinz to give it uo to him, and afterwards sued McFarlan upon it, who grounded his defence upon this, that the note was never delivered over.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sergeant.

True: but the point in discussion was the delivery; and the jury found for the plaintiff. Cowp 206. Any proof of intention to assent to a delivery is sufficient; no particular mode of action, no form of expression, are necessary. The present question, however, is, whether the Court will confirm the judgment as to the partner who sealed the warrant, and vacate it as to the other. The adverse Counsel have cited 2 Bac. Abr. 227. 358. to show that the judgment, being an entire thing, must be wholly set aside, if at all. But this doctrine is fully refuted by 1 Cro. 322. 2 Black. Rep. 1133. With respect to the warrant's being executed while Soyer was in prison, it may be observed, that an Attorney was present; and in Sluyter's case, the Court determined that it was not necessary the Attorney should be for the party; but that it was enough if the business was fairly transacted in the presence of an Attorney.

As this was a joint debt, justice naturally requires that the judgment should be confirmed; and it being admitted, that a contract not under seal made by one, would bind both partners, we alledge that the seal creates no difference, for the causa contractu is the sole criterion. Seals are of the same effect in Lee Mercatoria as at Common-law; and there is no authority to mention the opposite doctrine; for, Shep. 69. is not the case of joint contractors. The books in general, where they speak of the obligation imposed on one partner by the contract of another, mention only notes, and whether under seal or not, is not distinguished. When we declare upon them, we alledge the subscription of both partners though, in fact, one only subscribes. Therefore, and because delivery is no farther necessary than as evidence of passing the interest, the first point seems determined in the negative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2nd Point. He observed that the several authorities quoted on the other side, were drawn from writs of error; and, as this record could not appear in its present form, if carried into a Superior Court, he inferred, that either the authorities were not applicable, or the record was to be considered upon the ground of a removal by writ of error: and in that case for error dans le record, the judgment must be wholly reversed; but when the error is dehors, the judgment may be reversed in part, and confirmed in part. 1. Leon. 317. Cro. E. 115. 3 Lev. 36. Moore 564. Besides, he contended, that the release of errors, contained in the warrant of Attorney, purges and protects whatever might be deemed irregular with respect to Soyer; although it may not be sufficient to set up a void proceeding against Basse. 2 Stra. 1215. 3 Mod. 109. 6 Co. 25.

Where, indeed, the different parts of the judgment are, in their nature separable, as in fines and common recoveries, mere modes of assurance, it may be done; and to those cases only the adverse authorities are confined. 2 Bac. Abr. 569. explains the mode of reversing judgments; and 2 Bac. Abr. 227. is so full upon the impartibility of judgments, that it cannot be too often insisted upon, in the present case. 2 Black. Rep. 1131. contains the same doctrine. 3d. The release of errors must be considered under the distinction in 3 Mod. 109. which shows that where divers are to recover in the personality, the release of one is a bar to all, but it is not so in point of discharge. 6 Co. 25, (a) is explicit, that, where two, or more, are charged jointly, if they bring a writ of error to discharge themselves, the release of one cannot bar the other; for, they have not any interest or benefit, but a joint charge and burthen, which cannot be discharged or released, unless by the plaintiff who has the interest and benefit of it.
