Suppose, for instance, a street were 60 feet wide, 12 feet might be taken off it, without doing any material injury to the public property, or creating any great obstruction to passengers; yet, surely this will not justify any man's actually building upon, and assuming the property of the 12 feet that could be thus spared.</p>\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "", "id": 2381777, "judges": "", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2381777/", "sha1": "d1c9cfc5319b1052503659ab8ac57cfaaa953ce1", "source": "L", "time_retrieved": "2013-10-30T02:18:21.200074"}
