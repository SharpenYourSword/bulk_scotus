The Defendant thereupon pleaded, that the arbitrators made no award. The Plaintiffs replied, and set forth an award, whereby (among other things) the arbitrators did award and order, 'that in consideration of the loss sustained by the exchange of certificates between John Grier, deceased, and the said Joseph Grier, senior, the said Joseph Grier, pay to the executors of the said John Grier, the sum of one hundred and seventy five pounds;' and then the Plaintiffs aver, that they are the executors of the testament and last will of the said John Grier, deceased, in the said award mentioned and intended, and that to them the said sum of L.175 by the said writing of award was ordered to be paid by the said Joseph Grier, senior.

In support of which, the Defendants counsel cited, 1 Bacon's Abr. 139. Hob. 49. Carth. 157. Godbolt 13. Dyer. 242. 1 Ld. Raym. 123, 1 Bac.

That the executors of John Grier, deceased, are persons certain and known. And, lastly, that if the executors were strangers, yet the award is good; for the Defendant ought to have rejoined, that the executors were strangers. For which positions were cited I Burr 277. I Bacon Abr. 135. 139. 141. 145. 147. I Ld Raym. 612. 246. 533. Cro. Fac. 200. 354. Cro. Elis. 858. 8 Co. 98. 3 Vin. Abr. 121. Comyns 329. Carth. 136.

By the condition of the bond in this case it appears, that a particular controversy between the parties was, 'about the exchange of a number of loan office certificates,' and, by the award, the Defendant is ordered, to pay to the executors of John Grier, deceased, L.175 in consideration of the loss sustained by the exchange of certificates between the said John Grier and him. From these it may be collected, and the meaning of the arbitrators seems to be, that a loss had been sustained by the exchange of certain loan office certificates between a certain John Grier, deceased, and the Defendants, that this loss affected the Plaintiffs in some way or other, because it was made an express article in the submission, and that the payment of the money to the executors of John Grier, should determine the controversy on this account. John Grier, deceased, has executors, who they are may be easily ascertained; as easily as the costs of an action, or the charges of a voyage, which have been adjudged to be good awards, because they can be reduced to a certainty. 3 Cro. 383. Beale v. Beale and I Rolls Abr. 251. So that this award appears to be certain enough. Besides, if the executors are considered as strangers, yet, by the better authorities, an award to pay money to them shall be intended for the benefit of the Plaintiffs, and that they, being the submittants, were either the executors, or authorized by them, unless the contrary appear.

And, therefore, as the Executors of John Grier deceased are persons certain, we think that it may be averred, who they are by name, as has been done by the replication in the present case, were such averment necessary; for it is only explaining more particularly what was contained in the award itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the whole, the court is of opinion, that the award in this case is good.
