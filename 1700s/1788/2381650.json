And the Defendant was accordingly discharged.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The object that the Defendant meant to accomplish by this proceeding, was to reverse the attainder; in consequence of which his title to the estate would revive, and, as it had not been appropriated or disposed of by the Commonwealth, there would then be no obstacle to his taking immediate possession. The Legislature soon afterwards passed an act in favor of Mr. Gordon's pretensions.</p>\n\n</div>",
