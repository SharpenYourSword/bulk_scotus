And it was said by M`KEAN, Chief Justice, that this case could not be properly compared with the case of an attorney <span class=\"star-pagination\">*270</span> without power of substitution; for, the attorney cannot exceed the letter of his authority, being nothing more than an agent himself. But each partner is a principal; and it is implied in the very nature of their connection, that each has a right to depute and appoint a clerk to act for both, in matters relative to their joint interest.</p>\n<p>Verdict for the Defendant.</p>\n</div>",
