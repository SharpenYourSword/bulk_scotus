If that is sufficient to satisfy the Plaintiff, he has done well to secure himself; but in the present action the Judgment obtained in Massachusetts cannot be considered as conclusive evidence of the debt, and, therefore, the Defendant ought still to be at liberty to controvert and deny it.

To the clause, that \"full faith and \"credit shall be given in each of these States to the records, acts, and judicial proceedings \"of the Courts and Magistrates of every other State,\" it was moved to \"add, \"and an action of debt may be commenced in a Court of law of any State \"for the recovery of a debt due on a judgment of any Court in any other State; \"provided the judgment creditor shall give bond with sufficient sureties before the \"said Court, in which the action shall be brought, to answer in damages to the \"adverse party, in case the original judgment shall be afterwards revised and set \"aside; and provided the party against whom such judgment may have been obtained \"had notice in fact of the service of the original writ upon which such judgment \"shall be founded.\" But this motion was rejected.</p>\n\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "", "id": 2381780, "judges": "M`kean", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2381780/", "sha1": "8561bb6d350c0941a993207d16b7549bcae01e84", "source": "L", "time_retrieved": "2013-10-30T02:18:21.224815"}
