The cause must, therefore, be continued, subject to the rule for trial at the next term, or Non Pros: And, in the mean time, we direct, on our own authority, a rule to be entered for taking the depositions of infirm witnesses de bene esse; to be read in evidence upon the trial, in case of death, or inability to attend.
