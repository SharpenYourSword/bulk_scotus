Was she entitled to any compensation? 2d. Had she received a compensation? As to the <i>first,</i> it was RULED, that if the services were rendered merely in <i>expectation</i> of a legacy, without any contract, express or implied, but relying, implicitly, on the testator's generosity, the action could not be maintained. The weight of the evidence, however, is that he promised to take care of her, though he did not say how; that at one time he offered to marry her; and, at another time, he said that he would provide for her as a child. As to the <i>second</i> question, it is merely a matter of fact, on which the jury must decide.</p>\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "", "id": 2620869, "judges": "", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2620869/", "sha1": "172e455c9fdf2f467758ed00c63973c1496a212c", "source": "L", "time_retrieved": "2013-11-01T12:50:41.779357"}
