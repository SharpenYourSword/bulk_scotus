The equitable right acquired by the lessor of plaintiff under a licence, has been perfected, by a survey, and patent; so that he clearly possesses a legal title to the land in dispute.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the defendant has no office right, but rests his pretensions, on an early possession, the exclusion of the disputed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*122</span> land in the re-survey of 1764, and the award and judgment, in the action of trespass. Of the equitable circumstances, the jury will judge, with this remark from the Court; that a mere improvement right, ought never to be rendered effectual in favour of a settler, when it commences subsequent to the existence of the legal right, regularly vested in another.</p>\n<p>The great objection, however, to the plaintiff's recovery, arises from the award and judgment. To be sure, an award cannot give a right to land; but a report of referees will settle a dispute about land, either in an ejectment, or in an action of trespass. In the case of Fox's Lessee v. Franklin, a similar report has been made, and affirmed. Indeed, such a report is more operative than a verdict: for, a verdict in ejectment is not conclusive; but when parties chuse to adjust their disputes amicably, they generally agree, that the award shall be final; and, under such an agreement, neither of them can hope again successfully to agitate the same points.</p>\n<p>Under this charge, the plaintiff suffered a nonsuit.<sup>[(1)]</sup></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[(2)]  Decided at Carlisle, in Cumberland county, Nisi Prius, 11th May 1792, before SHIPPEN and BRADFORD, Justices.</p>\n<p>[(1)]  Decided at Nisi Prius, Garlesic Camichland county, in May 1792.</p>\n\n</div>",
