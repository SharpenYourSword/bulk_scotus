But it is said by the plaintiff's Counsel, and I assent to the proposition, that if there is any fraud, or collusion; say, if there is any unreasonable delay occasioned by the conduct <span class=\"star-pagination\">*216</span> of the garnishee himself, such cases will form exceptions to the general rule. In the present instance, however, there is no proof of fraud, or collusion; nor of any wilful procrastination on the part of the garnishee; and fraud can never be presumed. It is true, likewise, that no express authority was given for laying the attachments; but an implied authority appears in the correspondence that has been produced: And the defendant is not answerable for the event. I am, therefore, of opinion that interest ought not to be allowed.</p>\n<p>SHIPPEN, Justice.</p>\n<p>Evidence will often strike different minds in a different manner. It does not appear to me, that there was sufficient authority for instituting the foreign attachment; but, on the contrary, that it was done officiously, and at the instance of the garnishee himself. I should, consequently, think it just, on this occasion, to allow the claim of interest; but the majority of the Court will sanction a different decision.</p>\n<p>YEATES, Justice.</p>\n<p>I concur, generally, in the opinion expressed by the Chief Justice, that there is not sufficient ground to except the present case from the operation of the general rule.</p>\n<p>BRADFORD, Justice.</p>\n<p>As I was originally Counsel in this cause, I forbear taking any part in the decision.</p>\n<p>BY THE COURT:  It is awarded, that the defendant be discharged, upon payment of the principal sum recovered, with costs.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  A writ of error was brought by the Plaintiff; and on the 18th of July 1793, the HIGH COURT OF ERRORS AND APPEALS delivered the following judgment.\n</p>\n<p>BY THE COURT:  After making consideration and due deliberation, it is considered by the Court here  1st.
