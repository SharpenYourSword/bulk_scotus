The Constitution declares that 'full faith and credit shall be given in each State to the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of every other State': And the act provides, that those records and judicial proceedings, being authenticated in the mode prescribed, 'shall have such faith and credit given to them in every Court within the United States, as they have by law or usage in the Courts of the State, from whence the said records are, or shall be, taken.' It is a general principle, that a debt cannot be denied, without denying the instrument on which it is founded: and the only question left open, by the act of Congress, is whether the Courts of New Jersey would sustain any other plea than nul tiel record, if the present action had been brought there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ingersoll declined arguing the point for the defendant, thinking it clearly against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Wilson, Justice:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There can be no difficulty in this case.
