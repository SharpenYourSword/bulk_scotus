It is evident, that the District Judge was acting in a judicial capacity, when he determined, that the evidence was not sufficient to authorize his issuing a warrant for apprehending Captain Barre: and (whatever might be the difference of sentiment entertained by this Court) we have no power to compel a Judge to decide according to the dictates of any judgment, but his own. It is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> unnecessary, however, to declare, or to form, at this time, any conclusive opinion, on the question which has been so much agitated, respecting the evidence required by the 9th article of the Consular Convention.</p>\n<p>The Rule discharged.</p>\n</div>",
