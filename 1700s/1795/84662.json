If, indeed, it cannot be considered as an official document, but as a private paper, however ancient it may be, the original must be produced; for, a copy is not the best evidence the nature of the case admits.

The only question, therefore, is whether the paper, now offered, was found under such circumstances of authenticity as to render it proper evidence?
