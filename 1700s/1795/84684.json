He insisted, however, that the discretion vested in certain judges, relative to a commitment for crimes, by the 33rd section of the Judicial Act (I Vol. Swift's Edit. p. 72) having been exercised by the District Judge, on such depositions as satisfied him, this court, having merely a concurrent authority, can only revise his decision in one of two cases, &#8212;- 1st. The occurrence of new matter; or, 2ndly. A charge of misconduct; -neither of which is pretended. But, after stating the general character of the insurrection, he read several affidavits, with a view to establish the prisoner's agency in it; and concluded with urging, that, if the prisoner was released at all, it should be on giving satisfactory bail to take his trial in the Circuit Court. 4 Bl.
