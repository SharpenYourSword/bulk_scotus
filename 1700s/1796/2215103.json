The general rule prescribes to us an adoption of that practice, which is founded on the custom and usage of Courts of Admiralty and Equity, constituted on similar principles; but still, it is thought, that we are also authorised to make such deviations as are necessary to adapt the process and rules of the Court to the peculiar circumstances of this country, subject to the interposition, alteration, and controul, of the Legislature<sup>[*]</sup>.</p>\n<p>We have, therefore, agreed to make the following general Orders; and the Counsel, in the present case, will take his measures accordingly.</p>\n<p>1. ORDERED, That when process at Common Law, or in Equity, shall issue against a State, the same shall be served upon the Governor, or Chief Executive Magistrate, and the Attorney-General, of such State.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*321</span> 2. ORDERED, That process of subpna issuing out of this Court, in any suit in Equity, shall be served on the Defendant sixty days before the return day of the said process: and, further, that if the Defendant, on such service of the subpna, shall not appear at the return day contained therein, the complainant shall be at liberty to proceed ex parte.</p>\n<p>Lewis then observed, that the subpna in this case, had been issued on the same principles; but as the orders could only operate in futuro, he thought it best to withdraw his motion for a distringas, and to pray that an alias subpna might be awarded; which was, accordingly, done.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  See the Judicial Act, s. 14.
