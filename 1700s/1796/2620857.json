The penalty was merely superadded as a security for performance; and not as a sum to be paid and received absolutely in lieu of performance. The plaintiff is entitled (notwithstanding the penalty) to recover damages, commensurate with the injury suffered by a non-performance. The judgment must, therefore, be rendered in his favour, for the full amount of the verdict.</p>\n</div>",
