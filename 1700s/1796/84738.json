Olivier</i>, who, on the 6th of <i>October</i> 1792, presented it for payment to Messrs. <i>Cottin, Jonge</i>, and <i>Girardot</i>; and those gentlemen tendered payment in assignats, which, by the then existing laws of <i>France</i>, were made a lawful tender, in payment of debts. Mr. <i>Olivier</i> refused to receive the assignats, by order of <i>George Barclay</i> and Co., declaring, at the same time, that he would receive no other money than <i>French</i> crowns; and thereupon each party protested against the act of the other. The bill being returned under protest for non-payment, <i>Searight</i>, on the one hand, instituted a suit, to recover the sum which <i>Calbraith</i> and Co. had originally stipulated to pay; and, on the other hand, <i>Calbraith</i> and Co. instituted a suit to recover damages for the protest of the bill.

And the great question of fact for decision, was, whether the parties contracted for a payment in gold and silver; or tacitly left the medium of payment, to the laws of <i>France</i>, where the bill was payable?

The sole question, therefore, in the cause is, whether the tender of assignats, in payment of the bill, was a compliance with that contract? The notarial protest, not only states the tender, but certifies, that assignats were lawful money of <i>France</i>, in payment of debts. A notary should, indeed, certify all the facts that occur, in relation to the protest (not merely the refusal to pay, according to the demand) but, it is doubtful, whether his assertion would be conclusive, as to the lawfulness of the money tendered.

After such a demand, it was, perhaps, unnecessary for the party to exhibit the assignats to <i>Olivier</i>; but the form of the demand, on one side, cannot dispense with the obligation, on the other side, to make a tender of payment, agreeably to his own sense of the law and the contract.

Upon examination, too, the doctrine of that book appears to be founded in just and legal principles. Every man is bound to know the laws of the own country; but no man is bound to know the laws of foreign countries.

Where the contracts, plainly referring to a foreign country for their execution, adopt and recognize the <i>lex loci.</i> The present controversy, therefore, turns upon the fact, whether the parties meant to abide by the law of <i>France</i>?

But if the jury should in the first action (<i>Searight</i> v. <i>Calbraith</i> and Co.) find, either wholly or partially for the defendant; in the second action (<i>Calbraith</i> and Co. v. <i>Searight</i>) they should find for the defendant generally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PETERS, <i>Justice</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision depends entirely on the intention of the parties, of which the jury must judge.
