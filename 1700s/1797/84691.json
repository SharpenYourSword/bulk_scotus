The only objection arising on the record, was-whether a paper money payment of a British debt into the treasury of Maryland, during the war, by virtue of a law of the state, was a bar to the creditor's recovery at this time? And the solemn adjudication in Ware vs. Hylton et al. ant. p. 199. having settled that point, Dallas, for the Defendant in error, submitted the case, without argument, to the Court, who, in general terms, reversed the judgment of the High Court of Appeals, and affirmed the judgment of the General Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It then became a question, to which of the State Courts the Mandate should be sent, and what costs should be allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E. and W.

In the case, then, of a reversal of a Judgment of the Circuit Court, the 24th, section of the Judicial Act provides, that on reversals in the Supreme Court, they shall proceed to render such judgment, or pass such Decree, as the Inferior Court should have done; and shall send a special mandate to the Circuit Court to award execution thereupon. If, therefore, the Decree of a Circuit, reversing the Decree of a District, Court, were reversed, the mandate would be sent to the former, and not to the latter, and by a parity of reasoning in the present instance, the writ should be sent to the Court of Appeals, and not to the General Court. The construction seems to be strengthened by that part of the 25th. section, which contemplates, that the cause might be remanded to the State Court more than once; as, it is not probable, that the Court whose judgment is affirmed, would require a second order; and, it is surely proper, that the Court, whose judgment is reversed, should be apprised of the event.
