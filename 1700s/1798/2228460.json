And it was argued by Ingersoll, for the Lessor of the Plaintiff, and by Duncan and C. Smith, for the Defendant.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*489</span> The court stopped Ingersoll, when he was about to reply, and delivered their opinion as follows.</p>\n<p>M`KEAN, Chief Justice.</p>\n<p>We entertain no doubt on the present question. The Legislature has, at various periods, and on a variety of subjects, departed from feudal ceremonies and principles, in relation to the transfer and descent of property: but, in the present instance, the act of Assembly meant only to give to a grant of lands, a greater effect upon the estate, on recording the deed, than could previously have been enjoyed, without livery of seizen: It never contemplated that circumstance, as an instrument to work a forfeiture, on the common law doctrine of alienation by tenant for life, or years.</p>\n<p>SHIPPEN, Justice.</p>\n<p>From the words of the act of Assembly, it is plain, I think, that the Legislature did not mean to work the forfeiture of a particular estate, by the provision for recording deeds. In allowing to deeds recorded the same force and effect, as feoffments with livery, the intention is expressly restricted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*490</span> to \"giving possession and seisen, and making good the title and assurance of lands, tenements, and hereditaments.\" It is, therefore, merely a facility and benefit extended to the grantee.</p>\n<p>YEATES and SMITH, Justices, concurred.</p>\n<p>JUDGMENT for the Plaintiff.</p>\n</div>",
