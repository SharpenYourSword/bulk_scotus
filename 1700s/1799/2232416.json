He added, that he did not regard the first ground of objection as insurmountable; but deemed it unnecessary to give a decisive opinion on it.</p>\n<p>PETERS, District Judge, did not think, that either objection ought to prevail. He thought that the venire, and returns of the jurors, were authorised by principle and precedent; and that the declarations of Rhodes were such as might naturally be made in relation to the insurrection, without manifesting a particular hostility towards the prisoner, or leading to a conviction in spite of any evidence, or argument, that might <span class=\"star-pagination\">*519</span> occur on the trial As, however, the consequence of dividing the Court, would be a rejection of the motion; and as the interests of public justice, and the influence of public example, would not be impaired by the delay of a new trial, the DISTRICT JUDGE determined to acquiesce in the opinion of JUDGE IREDELL.</p>\n<p>A new trial awarded.</p>\n</div>",
