And although by the terms of the proclamation, the personal application of Douglass was requisite to obtain a land warrant on the said right, yet the laws of Virginia, passed subsequent to her independence, dispensed with such personal application, and made a warrant issuable to the assignee, Sims, he being an inhabitant of that state on the 3d of May, 1779. A warrant he accordingly obtained, and the same duly located on Montour's Island, the land in question; which his warrant was more than sufficient to cover, and which, from its description as an island, was perfectly aparted and distinguished from all other land. By which means Sims acquired to the said island a complete equitable title, and one which needed only a patent of confirmation to render it a complete legal title. A confirmation of this equitable title, as effectual as that of any patent could have been, was afterwards comprised in the compact between Virginia and Pennsylvania, and in the ratification of the same by the legislative act of the latter. The terms therein of \"reserve and confirmation\" of the \"rights\" which had been previously acquired under Virginia, in the territory thereby relinquished to Pennsylvania, must, from the nature of the transaction, be expounded favorably for those rights, and so that titles, before substantially good, should not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*457</span> after a change of jurisdiction, be defeated or questioned for formal defects.</p>\n<p>It further appears, that Sims, since the said compact and ratification, has, without any laches that would prejudice his claim, obtained a legal survey of the said land under Pennsylvania. In which state, payment, or as in this case consideration passed, and a survey though unaccompanied by a patent, give a legal right of entry, which is sufficient in ejectment. Why they have been adjudged to give such right, whether from a defect of Chancery powers, or for other reasons of policy or justice, is not now material. The right once having become an established legal right, and having incorporated itself as such, with property and tenures, it remains a legal right notwithstanding any new distribution of judicial powers, and must be regarded by the common law courts of the United States, in Pennsylvania, as a rule of decision.</p>\n<p>The JUDGMENT of the Circuit Court affirmed.</p>\n<p>IREDELL,<sup>[*]</sup> Justice.</p>\n<p>Though I concur with the other Judges of the Court in affirming the Judgment of the Circuit Court, yet as I differ from them in the reasons for affirmance, I think it proper to state my opinion particularly.</p>\n<p>In order to do this with the greater distinctness, it is necessary that I should observe upon the nature of this title according to my ideas of it, from its origin to what may be deemed its consummation, at least for the purpose of maintaining this ejectment.</p>\n<p>My observations, therefore, will be under the following heads of inquiry:</p>\n<p>1st. Whether it sufficiently appears that William Douglas was entitled to a military right, such as it was, under the Proclamation of 1763.</p>\n<p>2d. Whether the right of Douglas, in case he was so entitled, was assignable, under the Royal Government, or since.</p>\n<p>3d. Whether the Lessor of the Plaintiff in the ejectment, had a title, and if any, of what nature it was, under the laws of Virginia.</p>\n<p>4th. Whether he had any title, subsequent to the compact, under the laws of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>5th. Whether if he had a title, it was such as was sufficient to maintain this ejectment.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*458</span> The first question is,</p>\n<p>1. Whether it sufficiently appears that William Douglas was entitled to a military right, such as it was, under the Proclamation of 1763?</p>\n<p>Though the finding be not altogether so correct as it might have been, yet I think it may be fairly inferred that William Douglas had all the requisites to entitle him to a military right under that Proclamation, especially as the Jury have said generally that the King gave to him the right in question by that Proclamation, which could not have been in fact true had any of the requisites been wanting, and though a general finding inconsistent with a particular one cannot stand, yet I am of opinion a particular finding consistent with a general one may.</p>\n<p>The next question is,</p>\n<p>1. Whether the right of Douglas was assignable under the Royal Government, or since?</p>\n<p>The grant was general to all who were the objects of it, and required only evidence of proper service, and the usual steps towards, obtaining a grant under any of the then Provinces. The Royal faith was pledged, that in such a case a grant should issue. It was immaterial, at that time, in what province the grant was obtained, as all belonged equally to the Crown. The grant was for meritorious services already performed, and therefore it was an interest, though in some degree indefinite in its nature, sanctioned by every principle of moral obligation, and such as the party entitled might, on the most solemn principles of public justice, confidently demand. Upon a large scale, the Crown was certainly a trustee for all those persons to whom its faith was pledged; and, therefore, so far as no particular prerogative of the Crown interfered, it was rational to consider it in the light of any other trust. It has been doubtful whether the Crown could in any case be a trustee, so as to be the object of any municipal decision, but the law could never presume (however the fact may be) that the Crown would not faithfully perform any trust belonging to it. The only difference between that and a private trust, is, that the latter is clearly enforcible by a Court of Equity; the former perhaps must be left to the conscience of the Crown itself. But this makes no difference in the nature of the interest. If this had been a private trust, it would at least have amounted to what in Equity is called a possibility, and it has been long settled that a possibility is assignable in Equity for a valuable consideration. I fee no reason why that principle cannot apply here. The necessity of a personal application was undoubtedly indispensible under the Royal government; but the two things are, in my opinion, perfectly compatible. Suppose such an assignment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*459</span> had been made, a personal application was still necessary, and very probably for the judicious reasons assigned at the Bar; but after the grant, obtained on such personal application, if the interest had been fairly assigned before, the assignee would have been entitled to a conveyance. If none had been made, which would have been an acknowledgment of the fairness of the transaction, Chancery only could have been applied to, to compel a conveyance. The assignor or his heir would then have had to answer on oath, and an examination of all particulars might have been made, after which, if the Court had entertained the least doubt of the fairness of the transaction, they would not have ordered a conveyance. This would be a sufficient guard against fraud. But the assignment previous to an actual grant might have been necessary even to save an officer from starving. How hard would have been his condition, if he could have made no immediate use of a bounty of the Crown, expressly intended as a provision for him, but which circumstances might prevent his receiving for years?</p>\n<p>Thus the case stood, as I conceive, under the Royal government. By the Revolution, the circumstances of it were, in some degree, changed, but not so as, in my opinion, materially to alter the nature of the title in this respect. The duty of the Crown, substantially, devolved on the several States, who became possessed of the territory formerly belonging wholly to the Crown; but as it might be an unreasonable thing to burden any one State with the whole of these provisions, some modification of the title might be expected so as to prevent this injury. This, however, does not seem to afford any reason why it should not remain an assignable interest, subject to the restriction I mentioned before, in case a personal application was still insisted upon, which it was undoubtedly optional in the States to require, or not. I therefore am of opinion, that the interest still remained assignable, subject only to such regulations as each State might think proper to require.</p>\n<p>The next subject of enquiry is,</p>\n<p>3d. Whether the Lessor of the Plaintiff in the ejectment had a title, and if any, of what nature it was, under the laws of Virginia?</p>\n<p>I confess I have had great difficulty in construing the two Virginia acts, of May, and October, 1779, and if the latter act had admitted of such a construction that I could, without absurdity or manifest injustice have confined the words \"or assigns\" in that act, to mean only the heirs or assigns of those specially named in the former, I should undoubtedly have preferred that construction; because in the last act of May, 1779, the Virginia Legislature expressly designated the objects, for whom they <span class=\"star-pagination\">*460</span> meant to provide; and whatever I might think of that provision (though I am far from thinking it an unjust one) I should deem it unwarranted to extend it to any others by construction of a subsequent law, without plain words of extension, unless there was an irresistible implication to authorise it. Such an implication, I think, exists here. The first act specifies the various objects of its provision: 1st. Those who had obtained a Warrant from the Governor of Virginia, under the former government. 2d. Where the service was performed by an inhabitant of Virginia. 3d. Where the service was performed in some regiment or corps actually raised in Virginia. The act of October, 1779 introduces a new provision for some persons of other, viz. a residence in Virginia at the passing of the former act (the 3d of May, 1779,) but they expressly except from the operation of this provision those who had obtained warrants under the former government, and those who had performed military service in some regiment or corps actually raised in Virginia, and had served under the circumstances particularly described in the act. They also except persons who had obtained a title under any former warrant. They do not, however, except in any manner one description of persons, who were provided for in the former law, viz. persons who were inhabitants of Virginia, and had performed military service in some other than Virginia regiment or corps, unless they or some persons claiming under them had previously obtained a warrant for it. But the act affords no indication from which we have a right to infer, that the Legislature meant to repeal any of the provisions in the former law; and if they did not, then upon the construction of the Council for the Plaintiff in Error, the provision, as to the persons I have last mentioned, in plain English would stand thus: \"We are willing to reward the services \"of any of the inhabitants of our own particular state, \"when under the Royal government, by giving full effect to \"the Royal proclamation, by which the faith of the former \"government was pledged, provided the person, his heirs, or \"assigns, actually resided in Virginia on the 3d of May, 1779. \"But if such person moved out of this State before that day, or \"died and left heirs or assigns, who either never resided in Virginia, \"or did not actually reside thereon the auspicious 3d of \"May, 1779, he, she, or they, shall receive nothing for such service.\" \"Such a provision would undoubtedly be highly rediculous, for the grant under the proclamation was for services actually past, services of a highly meritorious nature, the risque of life, and sacrifice of private case, by entering into the army at a critical period, for the defence of their country; and to such persons certainly no additional merit could attach by a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*461</span> residence in Virginia on the 3d of May, 1779. I therefore am compelled, upon principles of respect to the Legislature, to abandon this construction; and then there remains no other but to suppose, that they meant to provide by implication for a new description of persons (though under negative, informal, and incorrect words,) viz. persons who had fairly obtained titles under any military grant, though not of the special description before enumerated, if such person, his heirs, or assigns, actually resided in Virginia on the 3d of May 1779. Willing, in short, to confirm all fair purchases made by permanent, not occasional, residents in Virginia, (of which the residence at that time should be a test) when they might innocently have supposed, either that Virginia was bound to provide for all military rights presented, or would be disposed upon a large and liberal scale to do so, and had thus laid out their money from a kind of indefinite confidence in the future conduct of their own Legislature: And the word \"hereafter\" that has been commented upon (in the 3d section. of the act of the 3d. of May, 1779,) and the express saving in the act of October, 1779, of all titles under warrants formerly issued, independent of the saving of titles under warrants from the former government, seem strongly to favour this construction. By construing the act in this manner, though some difficulties yet remain, they are, in my opinion, fewer than upon the other construction; and as they are more consistent with equity, justice, and common sense, I deem it my duty as a Judge, to support the construction which will tolerate these, in preference to one which is attended with greater difficulties, and accompanied with absurdity and injustice: especially, as that construction will make both acts consistent in their main objects, and the other (without any indication from the apparent meaning of the Legislature) would amount to an express repeal of an important provision; and nearly in effect revoke a grant actually made, which, if within the competence of a Legislature, is undoubtedly one of the most odious acts of its power, and which nothing but absolute necessity should force us to say they intended.</p>\n<p>The title, therefore, so far, under the laws of Virginia, I think was a vested right. But it seems to me now material to enquire, whether the title under the laws of Virginia was complete or incomplete. It is admitted, that a patent was regularly necessary to complete the title, even had a survey been made, and it is at least doubtful whether a warrant and survey would have given any legal right of possession at all. But in this case, it is contended, a survey was not necessary, for two reasons: I. Because the location of an island was certain, and the whole island would not exceed the quantity he was entitled to. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*462</span> 2. Because no money was to have been paid upon it. These reasons do not satisfy me that a survey was unnecessary. A survey I consider in all instances to be highly useful, in order that it may be officially ascertained, and officially known, not only what land in particular is taken up, but also its exact quantity, so far as it is material to specify it, for the information of the public, from whom the grant is to be obtained, as well as that of any individual who may have interfering claims or pretensions. The private knowledge of a few particular persons who may know the spot thoroughly, is by no means equal to the authentic information which an actual survey, a regular report, and a correct record, can convey; and the instances are so very few, where exact information can otherwise be obtained, that there is no occasion for the sake of those to make an exception: It would do no good, and might lead to endless difficulties. I think, therefore, the necessity of a survey ought to be deemed general and indispensible, and there being none in this case previous to the compact made with Pennsylvania, the title so far was incomplete. But I admit, had a survey been unnecessary, and had such steps been taken in Virginia as would, of course, have intitled the Defendant in error to a patent, then the compact and the act of confirmation in consequence might have been deemed a complete and perfect assurance of it, and as effectual as if a patent had been actually granted before the compact under the laws of Virginia.</p>\n<p>With respect to the payment of \u00a3.40. it is clear to me, that as that was meant as full purchase money for land, to which the person who entered had no right before, it never can apply to a case where the grant was for service already performed, unless the Legislature had wanted both common sense and common honesty. I have not hesitated a moment to reject that construction, the words in no manner requiring it, and easily admitting of the construction given by the counsel for the Defendant in error.</p>\n<p>The finding in this case, I think, sufficiently establishes a relinquishment of the Indian title previous to the year 1779, so as to authorize an entry and location in the river Ohio, at the times the entry and location on behalf of the Defendant in error took place, without a violation of any duty either to a particular State or to the United States.</p>\n<p>I come now to the next head of inquiry,</p>\n<p>4. Whether the Defendant in error had any title, subsequent to the compact under the laws of Pennsylvania?</p>\n<p>I do not consider that this compact, and the act in confirmation of it, immediately converted all inchoate and imperfect rights under Virginia into absolute and perfect ones under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*463</span> Pennsylvania, but that the intention was, such as the title was under Virginia, it should substantially be under Pennsylvania, in preference to any younger right that might have been obtained in any manner under Pennsylvania. If the manner of proceeding on both sides was the same, then the Virginia claimant had nothing to do, but to proceed under the laws of the latter, as if his original title had been obtained from Pennsylvania. If the manner of proceeding in both States had been different, then I should have supposed it would have been proper for Pennsylvania to pass a new law adequate to this new case, that the faith of the State might have been duly observed. But I conceive under both States a survey was indispensible, the same reasons which I have urged on this subject, in considering the case of the Virginia right, applying equally to both States. The survey that was accordingly had under the State of Pennsylvania I think was a valid one, notwithstanding the objection as to the bed of the river, for as the law is general, (such at least it appears to me) that where two countries, or two counties, border on a navigable river, the middle of the bed of the river is the boundary line, I see nothing in this case to prove it an exception, and consequently the survey appears to have been made by the proper authority. With regard to the objection that in the 9th finding it is stated, that the Governor of Virginia transmitted in 1784 a just and true lift of entries made under the authority of Virginia in the disputed territory, in which list the island in question is not comprehended, and therefore the verdict impliedly excludes it, I answer, 1st, If the Governor had or had not transmitted a perfect list, this could not have deprived any party really entitled of shewing a title which had been omitted, either designedly (though that could not be presumed, but I state it as the strongest case) or inadvertently, on the part of the Governor, where at least an adverse claimant under Pennsylvania was not prejudiced by such omission, but had early and sufficient notice of the prior right, before he had completed his own. 2d. It may be a true list, so far as it goes, but not perfect for want of a complete knowledge of all particulars, some of which might have been omitted to be ascertained in the usual and proper manner. 3d. The implication in this case cannot have the effect contended for, because the 10th finding refers to that lift, as including the entry and location of the Defendant in error, and the 4th finding declares, that two Deputy Surveyors under the Surveyor General of Pennsylvania did in 1785 receive from the Surveyor General's office, a list of entries made under the authority of Virginia, which list included the entry for the land in the declaration mentioned.</p>\n<p>The survey being in my opinion good, though it was subsequent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*464</span> to the grant to the Plaintiff in error; shall be deemed to relate to the time of taking out the warrant, not only in consequence of the compact, which secured all prior rights of Virginia, and the act in confirmation of it, but also on account of the express saving of all prior rights in the grant to the Plaintiff in error by the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, who seem to have guarded with solicitude against any supposed breach of public faith, and therefore it is immaterial to enquire, what would have been the case had Pennsylvania expressly violated it. But where a Legislature has constitutional authority to pass any law, I can conceive a manifest distinction between right and power; between the obligation on the part of the Legislature, upon principles of morality, to give effect to a solemn compact, and their, in fact, making a law in violation of it, which it is the duty of the Courts to obey. The Legislature is restricted indeed in this particular by the constitution of the United States; and a treaty of the United States is, by its own authority, de facto, as well as morally, binding, while it continues in force, because it shall be the supreme law of the land. But until this constitution did pass, I should doubt very much, whether if the Legislature had actually violated the compact, the Court could here set up the compact against the law, upon principles which I have stated at large in my argument on the subject of the British debts, and to which I beg leave to refer, as it is now publishing in Mr. Dallas's Reports.<sup>[*]</sup> I say this only incidentally, on account of observations on this subject at the bar, in which I by no means acquiesce.</p>\n<p>The warrant and survey being thus by me deemed complete and unexceptionable, under the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the only remaining enquiry is,</p>\n<p>5. Whether if the Defendant in error had a title, it was such as was sufficient to maintain this ejectment?</p>\n<p>Two objections are stated under this head.</p>\n<p>1. That the title, such as it is, is only an equitable, not a legal one, and therefore will not maintain an ejectment.</p>\n<p>2. That it is not brought within proper time, but is barred by the Statute of limitations.</p>\n<p>As to the first objection, did this title stand merely as an equitable one, I should strongly incline against it, if not deem it altogether insufficient. It is of infinite moment, in my opinion, that principles of law and equity should not be confounded, otherwise inextricable confusion will arise; neither will be properly understood; and instead of both being administered with useful guards, which the policy of each system has devised against abuse, an heterogeneous mass of principles, not intended to effort with each other, will be blended together, and the substance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*465</span> of justice will soon follow the forms calculated to secure it. I totally reject all the modern cases introduced by Lord Mansfield, and supported by some other Judges, but lately, wisely, as I conceive, discountenanced by the present Court of King's Bench, of taking notice of a Cestui que trust at all in any other right than as holding in fact possession, with the concurrence of the legal Trustee. So far, consistent with legal principles, a Court may go, but not, as I conceive, one step further, and that it violates the most important principles of the common law to consider a Cestui que trust as having an iota of legal right against the Trustee himself. Whatever excuse a Court may have for doing this, when the want of a Court of equity may urge them to procure substantial justice, by a deviation from legal strictness as to form, I should hesitate long, before I should deem myself warranted in assenting to such a practice, when both powers are vested in the very same Court, but each has different modes of proceeding prescribed to it. But I think we are relieved from any dilemma of this kind, by strong and unequivocal declarations of highly respectable gentlemen of long experience in this State, that a warrant and survey, where no money remained to be paid, and a patent was only to ascertain that all previous requisites had been complied with, has been uniformly deemed a legal title, as opposed to an equitable one; and has all the consequences as such, even as to Dower, which affords a strong presumption in favor of the supposed legal title, for it has been so long held (though I think erroneously at first) that there should be no Dower of a trust estate, that perhaps no Judge would be warranted in a Court of Chancery in allowing it. Whether this opinion was originally right or not, yet having been the ground of many titles, it would be improper in the Court to shake it. I am not certain, also, but it may properly be considered, that the proprietor under a warrant and survey (according to long usage) is at least in the nature of a tenant at will to the public, and as such has a right of possession against all others, except some person having a better right, claiming under the public, which better right does not, for the reasons I have given, exist in this case, in the Plaintiff in error. This point, however, I merely intimate, it not being necessary to deliver an opinion upon it.</p>\n<p>Another circumstance has occurred to me, which I suggest with diffidence, as it was not spoken to at the bar, that though the compact and confirming act did not render a survey unnecessary, yet when a survey was made, it being a right derived from compact alone, the title ought to stand on that ground alone, and not depend on a patent, which imports a grant by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*466</span> State, at its own discretion, of property of its own, and seems to imply that the State is the sole agent in the conveyance of the title.</p>\n<p>With respect to the objection from the statute of limitations, it is sufficient to say, that that act, in my mind, clearly contemplates other objects, and neither in its letter, or spirit, is to be applied to this new and peculiar case; but admitting that it did, the facts in this case do not come within the provisions of it, there appearing to have been no such laches as the act contemplated to prevent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The CHIEF JUSTICE observed, at the conclusion of the opinion of the Court, that Judge IREDELL (whose indisposition prevented his attendance) concurred in the result, but for reasons, in some respects, different from those which had been assigned. As I have since been favored with a copy of Judge IREDELL's notes, I should think the report of the case imperfect without publishing them.</p>\n<p>[*]  Ant. p. 256.</p>\n\n</div>",

And although by the terms of the proclamation, the personal application of Douglass was requisite to obtain a land warrant on the said right, yet the laws of Virginia, passed subsequent to her independence, dispensed with such personal application, and made a warrant issuable to the assignee, Sims, he being an inhabitant of that state on the 3d of May, 1779. A warrant he accordingly obtained, and the same duly located on Montour's Island, the land in question; which his warrant was more than sufficient to cover, and which, from its description as an island, was perfectly aparted and distinguished from all other land. By which means Sims acquired to the said island a complete equitable title, and one which needed only a patent of confirmation to render it a complete legal title. A confirmation of this equitable title, as effectual as that of any patent could have been, was afterwards comprised in the compact between Virginia and Pennsylvania, and in the ratification of the same by the legislative act of the latter. The terms therein of \"reserve and confirmation\" of the \"rights\" which had been previously acquired under Virginia, in the territory thereby relinquished to Pennsylvania, must, from the nature of the transaction, be expounded favorably for those rights, and so that titles, before substantially good, should not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*457</span> after a change of jurisdiction, be defeated or questioned for formal defects.</p>\n<p>It further appears, that Sims, since the said compact and ratification, has, without any laches that would prejudice his claim, obtained a legal survey of the said land under Pennsylvania. In which state, payment, or as in this case consideration passed, and a survey though unaccompanied by a patent, give a legal right of entry, which is sufficient in ejectment. Why they have been adjudged to give such right, whether from a defect of Chancery powers, or for other reasons of policy or justice, is not now material.

The Royal faith was pledged, that in such a case a grant should issue. It was immaterial, at that time, in what province the grant was obtained, as all belonged equally to the Crown. The grant was for meritorious services already performed, and therefore it was an interest, though in some degree indefinite in its nature, sanctioned by every principle of moral obligation, and such as the party entitled might, on the most solemn principles of public justice, confidently demand.

It has been doubtful whether the Crown could in any case be a trustee, so as to be the object of any municipal decision, but the law could never presume (however the fact may be) that the Crown would not faithfully perform any trust belonging to it. The only difference between that and a private trust, is, that the latter is clearly enforcible by a Court of Equity; the former perhaps must be left to the conscience of the Crown itself. But this makes no difference in the nature of the interest. If this had been a private trust, it would at least have amounted to what in Equity is called a possibility, and it has been long settled that a possibility is assignable in Equity for a valuable consideration. I fee no reason why that principle cannot apply here. The necessity of a personal application was undoubtedly indispensible under the Royal government; but the two things are, in my opinion, perfectly compatible. Suppose such an assignment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*459</span> had been made, a personal application was still necessary, and very probably for the judicious reasons assigned at the Bar; but after the grant, obtained on such personal application, if the interest had been fairly assigned before, the assignee would have been entitled to a conveyance. If none had been made, which would have been an acknowledgment of the fairness of the transaction, Chancery only could have been applied to, to compel a conveyance. The assignor or his heir would then have had to answer on oath, and an examination of all particulars might have been made, after which, if the Court had entertained the least doubt of the fairness of the transaction, they would not have ordered a conveyance. This would be a sufficient guard against fraud. But the assignment previous to an actual grant might have been necessary even to save an officer from starving. How hard would have been his condition, if he could have made no immediate use of a bounty of the Crown, expressly intended as a provision for him, but which circumstances might prevent his receiving for years?</p>\n<p>Thus the case stood, as I conceive, under the Royal government. By the Revolution, the circumstances of it were, in some degree, changed, but not so as, in my opinion, materially to alter the nature of the title in this respect. The duty of the Crown, substantially, devolved on the several States, who became possessed of the territory formerly belonging wholly to the Crown; but as it might be an unreasonable thing to burden any one State with the whole of these provisions, some modification of the title might be expected so as to prevent this injury. This, however, does not seem to afford any reason why it should not remain an assignable interest, subject to the restriction I mentioned before, in case a personal application was still insisted upon, which it was undoubtedly optional in the States to require, or not. I therefore am of opinion, that the interest still remained assignable, subject only to such regulations as each State might think proper to require.</p>\n<p>The next subject of enquiry is,</p>\n<p>3d. Whether the Lessor of the Plaintiff in the ejectment had a title, and if any, of what nature it was, under the laws of Virginia?</p>\n<p>I confess I have had great difficulty in construing the two Virginia acts, of May, and October, 1779, and if the latter act had admitted of such a construction that I could, without absurdity or manifest injustice have confined the words \"or assigns\" in that act, to mean only the heirs or assigns of those specially named in the former, I should undoubtedly have preferred that construction; because in the last act of May, 1779, the Virginia Legislature expressly designated the objects, for whom they <span class=\"star-pagination\">*460</span> meant to provide; and whatever I might think of that provision (though I am far from thinking it an unjust one) I should deem it unwarranted to extend it to any others by construction of a subsequent law, without plain words of extension, unless there was an irresistible implication to authorise it. Such an implication, I think, exists here. The first act specifies the various objects of its provision: 1st. Those who had obtained a Warrant from the Governor of Virginia, under the former government. 2d. Where the service was performed by an inhabitant of Virginia. 3d. Where the service was performed in some regiment or corps actually raised in Virginia. The act of October, 1779 introduces a new provision for some persons of other, viz. a residence in Virginia at the passing of the former act (the 3d of May, 1779,) but they expressly except from the operation of this provision those who had obtained warrants under the former government, and those who had performed military service in some regiment or corps actually raised in Virginia, and had served under the circumstances particularly described in the act. They also except persons who had obtained a title under any former warrant. They do not, however, except in any manner one description of persons, who were provided for in the former law, viz. persons who were inhabitants of Virginia, and had performed military service in some other than Virginia regiment or corps, unless they or some persons claiming under them had previously obtained a warrant for it. But the act affords no indication from which we have a right to infer, that the Legislature meant to repeal any of the provisions in the former law; and if they did not, then upon the construction of the Council for the Plaintiff in Error, the provision, as to the persons I have last mentioned, in plain English would stand thus: \"We are willing to reward the services \"of any of the inhabitants of our own particular state, \"when under the Royal government, by giving full effect to \"the Royal proclamation, by which the faith of the former \"government was pledged, provided the person, his heirs, or \"assigns, actually resided in Virginia on the 3d of May, 1779. \"But if such person moved out of this State before that day, or \"died and left heirs or assigns, who either never resided in Virginia, \"or did not actually reside thereon the auspicious 3d of \"May, 1779, he, she, or they, shall receive nothing for such service.\" \"Such a provision would undoubtedly be highly rediculous, for the grant under the proclamation was for services actually past, services of a highly meritorious nature, the risque of life, and sacrifice of private case, by entering into the army at a critical period, for the defence of their country; and to such persons certainly no additional merit could attach by a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*461</span> residence in Virginia on the 3d of May, 1779. I therefore am compelled, upon principles of respect to the Legislature, to abandon this construction; and then there remains no other but to suppose, that they meant to provide by implication for a new description of persons (though under negative, informal, and incorrect words,) viz. persons who had fairly obtained titles under any military grant, though not of the special description before enumerated, if such person, his heirs, or assigns, actually resided in Virginia on the 3d of May 1779. Willing, in short, to confirm all fair purchases made by permanent, not occasional, residents in Virginia, (of which the residence at that time should be a test) when they might innocently have supposed, either that Virginia was bound to provide for all military rights presented, or would be disposed upon a large and liberal scale to do so, and had thus laid out their money from a kind of indefinite confidence in the future conduct of their own Legislature: And the word \"hereafter\" that has been commented upon (in the 3d section. of the act of the 3d. of May, 1779,) and the express saving in the act of October, 1779, of all titles under warrants formerly issued, independent of the saving of titles under warrants from the former government, seem strongly to favour this construction. By construing the act in this manner, though some difficulties yet remain, they are, in my opinion, fewer than upon the other construction; and as they are more consistent with equity, justice, and common sense, I deem it my duty as a Judge, to support the construction which will tolerate these, in preference to one which is attended with greater difficulties, and accompanied with absurdity and injustice: especially, as that construction will make both acts consistent in their main objects, and the other (without any indication from the apparent meaning of the Legislature) would amount to an express repeal of an important provision; and nearly in effect revoke a grant actually made, which, if within the competence of a Legislature, is undoubtedly one of the most odious acts of its power, and which nothing but absolute necessity should force us to say they intended.</p>\n<p>The title, therefore, so far, under the laws of Virginia, I think was a vested right. But it seems to me now material to enquire, whether the title under the laws of Virginia was complete or incomplete. It is admitted, that a patent was regularly necessary to complete the title, even had a survey been made, and it is at least doubtful whether a warrant and survey would have given any legal right of possession at all. But in this case, it is contended, a survey was not necessary, for two reasons: I. Because the location of an island was certain, and the whole island would not exceed the quantity he was entitled to. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*462</span> 2. Because no money was to have been paid upon it. These reasons do not satisfy me that a survey was unnecessary. A survey I consider in all instances to be highly useful, in order that it may be officially ascertained, and officially known, not only what land in particular is taken up, but also its exact quantity, so far as it is material to specify it, for the information of the public, from whom the grant is to be obtained, as well as that of any individual who may have interfering claims or pretensions. The private knowledge of a few particular persons who may know the spot thoroughly, is by no means equal to the authentic information which an actual survey, a regular report, and a correct record, can convey; and the instances are so very few, where exact information can otherwise be obtained, that there is no occasion for the sake of those to make an exception: It would do no good, and might lead to endless difficulties. I think, therefore, the necessity of a survey ought to be deemed general and indispensible, and there being none in this case previous to the compact made with Pennsylvania, the title so far was incomplete. But I admit, had a survey been unnecessary, and had such steps been taken in Virginia as would, of course, have intitled the Defendant in error to a patent, then the compact and the act of confirmation in consequence might have been deemed a complete and perfect assurance of it, and as effectual as if a patent had been actually granted before the compact under the laws of Virginia.</p>\n<p>With respect to the payment of \u00a3.40. it is clear to me, that as that was meant as full purchase money for land, to which the person who entered had no right before, it never can apply to a case where the grant was for service already performed, unless the Legislature had wanted both common sense and common honesty. I have not hesitated a moment to reject that construction, the words in no manner requiring it, and easily admitting of the construction given by the counsel for the Defendant in error.</p>\n<p>The finding in this case, I think, sufficiently establishes a relinquishment of the Indian title previous to the year 1779, so as to authorize an entry and location in the river Ohio, at the times the entry and location on behalf of the Defendant in error took place, without a violation of any duty either to a particular State or to the United States.</p>\n<p>I come now to the next head of inquiry,</p>\n<p>4. Whether the Defendant in error had any title, subsequent to the compact under the laws of Pennsylvania?</p>\n<p>I do not consider that this compact, and the act in confirmation of it, immediately converted all inchoate and imperfect rights under Virginia into absolute and perfect ones under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*463</span> Pennsylvania, but that the intention was, such as the title was under Virginia, it should substantially be under Pennsylvania, in preference to any younger right that might have been obtained in any manner under Pennsylvania. If the manner of proceeding on both sides was the same, then the Virginia claimant had nothing to do, but to proceed under the laws of the latter, as if his original title had been obtained from Pennsylvania. If the manner of proceeding in both States had been different, then I should have supposed it would have been proper for Pennsylvania to pass a new law adequate to this new case, that the faith of the State might have been duly observed. But I conceive under both States a survey was indispensible, the same reasons which I have urged on this subject, in considering the case of the Virginia right, applying equally to both States. The survey that was accordingly had under the State of Pennsylvania I think was a valid one, notwithstanding the objection as to the bed of the river, for as the law is general, (such at least it appears to me) that where two countries, or two counties, border on a navigable river, the middle of the bed of the river is the boundary line, I see nothing in this case to prove it an exception, and consequently the survey appears to have been made by the proper authority. With regard to the objection that in the 9th finding it is stated, that the Governor of Virginia transmitted in 1784 a just and true lift of entries made under the authority of Virginia in the disputed territory, in which list the island in question is not comprehended, and therefore the verdict impliedly excludes it, I answer, 1st, If the Governor had or had not transmitted a perfect list, this could not have deprived any party really entitled of shewing a title which had been omitted, either designedly (though that could not be presumed, but I state it as the strongest case) or inadvertently, on the part of the Governor, where at least an adverse claimant under Pennsylvania was not prejudiced by such omission, but had early and sufficient notice of the prior right, before he had completed his own. 2d. It may be a true list, so far as it goes, but not perfect for want of a complete knowledge of all particulars, some of which might have been omitted to be ascertained in the usual and proper manner. 3d. The implication in this case cannot have the effect contended for, because the 10th finding refers to that lift, as including the entry and location of the Defendant in error, and the 4th finding declares, that two Deputy Surveyors under the Surveyor General of Pennsylvania did in 1785 receive from the Surveyor General's office, a list of entries made under the authority of Virginia, which list included the entry for the land in the declaration mentioned.</p>\n<p>The survey being in my opinion good, though it was subsequent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*464</span> to the grant to the Plaintiff in error; shall be deemed to relate to the time of taking out the warrant, not only in consequence of the compact, which secured all prior rights of Virginia, and the act in confirmation of it, but also on account of the express saving of all prior rights in the grant to the Plaintiff in error by the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, who seem to have guarded with solicitude against any supposed breach of public faith, and therefore it is immaterial to enquire, what would have been the case had Pennsylvania expressly violated it. But where a Legislature has constitutional authority to pass any law, I can conceive a manifest distinction between right and power; between the obligation on the part of the Legislature, upon principles of morality, to give effect to a solemn compact, and their, in fact, making a law in violation of it, which it is the duty of the Courts to obey. The Legislature is restricted indeed in this particular by the constitution of the United States; and a treaty of the United States is, by its own authority, de facto, as well as morally, binding, while it continues in force, because it shall be the supreme law of the land. But until this constitution did pass, I should doubt very much, whether if the Legislature had actually violated the compact, the Court could here set up the compact against the law, upon principles which I have stated at large in my argument on the subject of the British debts, and to which I beg leave to refer, as it is now publishing in Mr. Dallas's Reports.<sup>[*]</sup> I say this only incidentally, on account of observations on this subject at the bar, in which I by no means acquiesce.</p>\n<p>The warrant and survey being thus by me deemed complete and unexceptionable, under the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the only remaining enquiry is,</p>\n<p>5. Whether if the Defendant in error had a title, it was such as was sufficient to maintain this ejectment?</p>\n<p>Two objections are stated under this head.</p>\n<p>1. That the title, such as it is, is only an equitable, not a legal one, and therefore will not maintain an ejectment.</p>\n<p>2. That it is not brought within proper time, but is barred by the Statute of limitations.</p>\n<p>As to the first objection, did this title stand merely as an equitable one, I should strongly incline against it, if not deem it altogether insufficient. It is of infinite moment, in my opinion, that principles of law and equity should not be confounded, otherwise inextricable confusion will arise; neither will be properly understood; and instead of both being administered with useful guards, which the policy of each system has devised against abuse, an heterogeneous mass of principles, not intended to effort with each other, will be blended together, and the substance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*465</span> of justice will soon follow the forms calculated to secure it. I totally reject all the modern cases introduced by Lord Mansfield, and supported by some other Judges, but lately, wisely, as I conceive, discountenanced by the present Court of King's Bench, of taking notice of a Cestui que trust at all in any other right than as holding in fact possession, with the concurrence of the legal Trustee. So far, consistent with legal principles, a Court may go, but not, as I conceive, one step further, and that it violates the most important principles of the common law to consider a Cestui que trust as having an iota of legal right against the Trustee himself. Whatever excuse a Court may have for doing this, when the want of a Court of equity may urge them to procure substantial justice, by a deviation from legal strictness as to form, I should hesitate long, before I should deem myself warranted in assenting to such a practice, when both powers are vested in the very same Court, but each has different modes of proceeding prescribed to it. But I think we are relieved from any dilemma of this kind, by strong and unequivocal declarations of highly respectable gentlemen of long experience in this State, that a warrant and survey, where no money remained to be paid, and a patent was only to ascertain that all previous requisites had been complied with, has been uniformly deemed a legal title, as opposed to an equitable one; and has all the consequences as such, even as to Dower, which affords a strong presumption in favor of the supposed legal title, for it has been so long held (though I think erroneously at first) that there should be no Dower of a trust estate, that perhaps no Judge would be warranted in a Court of Chancery in allowing it. Whether this opinion was originally right or not, yet having been the ground of many titles, it would be improper in the Court to shake it. I am not certain, also, but it may properly be considered, that the proprietor under a warrant and survey (according to long usage) is at least in the nature of a tenant at will to the public, and as such has a right of possession against all others, except some person having a better right, claiming under the public, which better right does not, for the reasons I have given, exist in this case, in the Plaintiff in error. This point, however, I merely intimate, it not being necessary to deliver an opinion upon it.</p>\n<p>Another circumstance has occurred to me, which I suggest with diffidence, as it was not spoken to at the bar, that though the compact and confirming act did not render a survey unnecessary, yet when a survey was made, it being a right derived from compact alone, the title ought to stand on that ground alone, and not depend on a patent, which imports a grant by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*466</span> State, at its own discretion, of property of its own, and seems to imply that the State is the sole agent in the conveyance of the title.</p>\n<p>With respect to the objection from the statute of limitations, it is sufficient to say, that that act, in my mind, clearly contemplates other objects, and neither in its letter, or spirit, is to be applied to this new and peculiar case; but admitting that it did, the facts in this case do not come within the provisions of it, there appearing to have been no such laches as the act contemplated to prevent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The CHIEF JUSTICE observed, at the conclusion of the opinion of the Court, that Judge IREDELL (whose indisposition prevented his attendance) concurred in the result, but for reasons, in some respects, different from those which had been assigned. As I have since been favored with a copy of Judge IREDELL's notes, I should think the report of the case imperfect without publishing them.</p>\n<p>[*]  Ant. p. 256.</p>\n\n</div>",

The title of the Lessor of the Plaintiff is defective, because, 1st. The special verdict does not find, that William Douglas was entitled to the bounty under the proclamation of 1763, as being an officer within the description, and complying with the conditions of the gift. To be entitled, he must have been a reduced officer he must have served during the war of 1763 the service must have been in America he must have been resident there and he must have made a personal application for the benefit of the bounty. Not one of these requisites is clearly stated in the verdict, and some of them are entirely omitted. The rule, with respect to special verdicts, is, that they must find facts, not the evidence of facts; and no implication, however pregnant, will be allowed. In Trover, for instance, the jury must find an actual conversion, finding a demand and a refusal, though these are evidence of a conversion, will not be sufficient. Here, some of the facts are found, but not all of them; and setting forth the proclamation in hoec verba, will not cure the partial finding. 7 Bac. Abr. p. 6. pl.5.p.7.(new edit.) It is particularly important, that a personal application of the Donee should have been found, since the inducements of the government in making the gift in that form, independent of an acknowledgment for past services, evidently arose from the policy of ensuring the settlement of military men on an exposed frontier; and a desire to prevent frauds and speculation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2nd. If the special verdict does not find the facts, which were indispensible to entitle William Douglas to the bounty of the proclamation, it follows, of course, that nothing passed by the assignment of his right to Charles Sims. It is true, that William Douglas had a just claim to the bounty, and might be considered as having a right to it, even before a personal application; but without a personal application he could never reduce it to possession and enjoyment himself, nor sell and transfer it to another. An assignment is not a substitution of one person for another, but a transfer of something from the assignor to the assignee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3rd. The assignment from W. Douglas to C. Sims was made on the 16th of January 1779, before any law was enacted in Virginia, in relation to claims and rights of this description; and, therefore, its validity and operation must depend upon the terms and conditions of the proclamation, unless it shall be found that the Legislature of the state afterwards altered and improved the condition of the assignee: this, therefore, must be investigated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4th. The first act of the Virginia Legislature upon the subject, passed in May 1779, uses the terms 'All persons, their heirs or assigns' claiming lands under proclamation warrants for military service, shall be admitted to grants for the same as in other cases: but whether the claim was by the Donee, or his assignee, the provision (if at all applicable to the bounty of the proclamation of 1763) can only be expounded to embrace claims that were fairly vested by the Donee's making personal application, and proving a conformity to the other conditions of the gift. This part of the law, however, has a variety of other cases upon which it must attach, and which were unquestionably of an assignable nature. It cannot, therefore, be regarded as creating or recognizing an assignable quality in the bounty of the proclamation, which the proclamation itself does not create, or support; and, if no assignment could take place under the proclamation, unless there had been a previous personal application by the Donee, the word, 'heirs and assigns' coupled in the law with the Donee, must be construed to refer to cases, in which the Donee has duly obtained warrants and surveys.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the material section, (sec. 3.) in the act of May 1779, provides that no proclamation claim to lands shall hereafter be allowed except in the following cases: 1st. Where a warrant had been obtained during the former government; Or 2nd. where the military service was performed by an inhabitant of Virginia; or 3rd. where the military service was performed in some Virginia corps: And, in either case, the claimant must make due proof in a Court of record, and produce a certificate of it to the Register of the Land-Office within twelve months. Now, it is manifest that the case of the Lessor of the Plaintiff is not within any of these provisions: A warrant had not been obtained for W. Douglas's bounty under the old government; William Douglas had never been an inhabitant of Virginia; nor were his military services performed in any Virginia corps. William Douglas himself, therefore, would not have been entitled under the law; and so far, likewise, the claim of his assignee can only be maintained upon his title. By the revolution, Virginia within the boundaries of the state, acquired all the territorial rights, with greater powers, than the King of Great Britain previously possessed: The King was bound by his gift, and could neither defeat, or modify, the rights of the Donee; but Virginia, with the establishment of her independence and sovereignty, became the absolute proprietor of the unappropriated soil; and was at liberty to impose conditions, to give the law, in relation to antecedent, inchoate, gratuities and grants of the British monarch. In the exercise of this authority, she opened her Land-Office to claims for old military services, upon the reasonable stipulation, that a warrant should already have issued, or that the services should have been performed by a person inhabiting the state, or in a corps belonging to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5th. But by the preceeding law, it is evident, that two things are ambiguously expressed: It is not clearly defined, who is meant by the claimant in the third section; and it is not ascertained to what period the inhabitancy, of the person performing the military services, refers, to the time of the service, or to the time of the claim. Hence arose the necessity of introducing the law of October, 1779, which was passed (as its title declares, and great respect has been paid to a title in construing an ambiguous law, Hob. 232) 'for explaining and amending' the act that has just been examined; and the doubts, that had arisen, are recited in the preamble to the first section, 'doubts concerning the manner of proving rights for military service, under the proclamation of the king of Great Britain in the year 1763, whereby great frauds may be committed.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first enacting words are 'that no person, his heirs, or assigns, other than those who had obtained warrants under the former government, shall be hereafter admitted to any warrant for such military service, unless he, she, or they produce, etc. a proper certificate of proof, etc. by the oath of the party claiming, or other satisfactory evidence,' 1st. That such party was bona fide an inhabitant of Virginia, at the time of passing the preceding law (May 1779) or 2nd, That the person having performed the military service was in a Virginia corps before the date of the Proclamation, and continued in it till the corps was disbanded, or he was discharged or died. Now, in order to a fair understanding and exposition of the law, it should be remembered, that it contains no repealing clause or expression; and, consequently, the two laws, being in pari materia, must be so construed as to be rendered consistent and operative in all their parts. 1 Bl. C.82. Under this impression, the act of October, 1779, is evidently a restraining, and not an enlarging, statute. By the act of May 1779, the donee, claiming under the Proclamation, must have been an inhabitant of Virginia, or have served in a Virginia corps; and the act of October, 1779, without impairing or altering that requisite, in the case of the donee himself, only fixing the period of his inhabitancy to the passing of the former act, superadds that in the case of an assignment, the assignee, or claimant, must likewise have been an inhabitant of Virginia. William Douglas would not, it is clear, be entitled under either law; and is it not extravagant to insist, that the assignee shall take, when the assignor is excluded?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the act of October, 1779, speaks of 'the party claiming,' it must, indeed, intend a party who can legally claim, but it by no means describes who shall be a legal claimant: And when it speaks of 'such party,' the reference (which is not always to the next immediate antecedent. 18 Vin. Abr. Hard. 77.) must, in order to preserve the sense of the context, be applied to the donee, or to the heirs and assigns of a donee, duly entitled, according to the requisites of the Proclamation and law<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-3\" id=\"fn-s-3_ref\">*</a>. Besides, the same section provides for proof being made 'that the party had never before obtained a warrant or certificate for such military service;' which must be applied to the party performing the service, since it would not surely be enough to prove that an assignee had not, though the assignor might have before obtained a warrant. And it may be observed, by the bye, that the special verdict does not find the fact, that no warrant had issued on Douglas's claim, before the warrant which issued to the Lessor of the Plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6th. In addition to the exceptions already stated, another objection arises upon the Virginia law, enacted the 20th of June, 1780, which provides, that only one warrant shall issue to one person, founded on claims for military service; nor shall even one warrant issue, unless the claimant shall within six months from the end of the session, in which the law was enacted, prove a payment of 40 per hundred for the quantity of land in the warrant. This payment is not found by the special verdict nor has it ever, in fact, been made either to Virginia, or to Pennsylvania, acquiring all the rights of Virginia under the compact; but in aid of this defect, the verdict finds, that it was not the practice of Virginia to require the money to be paid by the holder of a military warrant for lands, except where more than one warrant issued for the same service. This finding, however, that the money was not required to be paid in Virginia, cannot prove that it was not due and payable to Pennsylvania; and a mere practice of Office in one State (which could not have been a practice of a long continuance when the compact took effect) is not sufficient to control the plain provisions of a law, or to affect the rights of another State. Whatever, therefore, might previously have been the pretentions of the Lessor of the Plaintiff, his non-compliance with the stipulated payment, is an abandonment, or forfeiture of his claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7th. But Montour's Island lay within the district of country occupied by the Indians, and therefore, it could not be the subject of location, for satisying a private claim to lands. The Proclamation of 1763, the Constitution and Laws of Virginia, and the Laws of Pennsylvania, all concur on this point. It is true, the special verdict finds, that before the year 1779, the Indian tribes had retired to the Northwest side of the Ohio, having abandoned and relinquished all the land, except on the Northwest side of the river, and that by various treaties, since made with the United States, the boundary line of their hunting grounds is very distant from the Northwest side: but, it is to be remembered, that it is also found by the special verdict, that the retreat of the Indian tribes was, 'in consequence of 'hostilities between them and the United States.' A retreat, under such circumstances is neither a dereliction, nor a cession. Acquisitions of territory, in consequence of hostilities, do not pass in full sovereignty; the transfer is not complete unless confirmed by the treaty of peace; and even if it was an acquisition in war, it was a national acquisition, and enured to the use of the United States. It appears, however, that the abandonment of the lands was owing to the necessities of war, and not with a view to a direliction; for, afterwards, at the treaty at Fort Stanwix, in the year 1784, this very property is ceded by the Indians, and the cession is made to Pennsylvania, not to Virginia. There may be an appropriation (which, it is said, is the effect of a warrant and survey) of an equitable estate; but, in the present case, the entry of the Surveyor, in the year 1787, was the entry of the Public Officer, not of the agent of the Lessor of the Plaintiff; it did not constitute an actual possession; and could not be effectual for any other purpose, than creating an appropriation of an equitable, or executory, estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8th. Though the treaty, or compact, between Virginia and Pennsylvania, ought to be held sacred, it cannot be so construed as to change the pre-existing state of property; rendering that perfect which was before imperfect, and making valid what was before void. The compact secures private property of every description; but it does not convert claims into rights, nor equitable rights into legal estates. The rights confirmed are those which would have been good against Virginia: complete rights are confirmed, without any act to be done by the party; and incomplete rights are confirmed in the precise situation, in which they were, at the date of the compact, to be rendered complete according to the law of the State, acquiring the jurisdiction and sovereignty. It must be conceded, that the warrants granted by Virginia on lands, which proved to belong to Pennsylvania, were ipso facto void; though it was reasonable and just to recognize them on a settlement of the territorial controversy. Reason and justice do not require, however, that such a recognition should be construed into a confirmation of the title (Co. Litt. 295.) giving to the compact the legal operation of a patent, without express words to produce that effect. Nor can the State be regarded as a trustee under the compact, for the use of the Lessor of the Plaintiff; for, she had granted the pre-emption right to the Defendant; and the Defendant, in a Court of Equity, would have been regarded as the Trustee, if any trust could be raised by implication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What, then, were the circumstances of the parties at the date of the compact, and afterwards? So early as the year 1783, the Defendant had procured an actual survey of the premises; and, according to the adverse doctrine, was thereupon in possession. But the lessor of the Plaintiff never attempted to procure a survey till the year 1787; (which could not divest the Defendant's previous possession, and he rested simply on his Virginia, warrant and entry; though a survey was surely requesite, if not to locate the land (inasmuch as naming the island might, in that respect, be deemed a sufficient designation) at least to ascertain the quantity. It is to be considered, indeed, that in the very list of entries in the Land Office, transmitted by the executive of Virginia to the executive of Pennsylvania, there is no specific mention of a location on Montour's island; and though the special verdict finds that Nevil and Ritchie received a list of Virginia entries, including an entry for the lands in the declaration mentioned, the list is not set forth in hoec verba; and the entry, for aught that appears, may have been made subsequent to the compact, or it may be in favor of the Defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides, there was a general prohibition as to surveying islands in the Ohio; 2 Vol. Penns. Laws, p.317. s.13. (Dall. Edit.) and the survey of Nevil and Ritchie, was, in fact, unauthorised by their commission, which circumscribes their district to limits, not including Montour's island. The commission authorises them to survey in a District formed of a part of Washington County: now, Montour's island lay, originally, within Westmoreland County; it lies at present within Alleghaney County; but it never was at any time included in Washington County. 1 Vol. Penns. Laws,874. (Dall. Edit.) 2 Vol. Penns. Laws.595. If, then, the survey itself is not lawful, it cannot be brought in aid of the title of the lessor of the Plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">9th. It only remains, on the question of title, to shew, that the Pennsylvania act of limitations, is a bar to the claim of the lessor of the Plaintiff. The act was passed on the 26th of March, 1785; and it declares, 'that no person having a claim to lands, or to the pre-emption thereof, founded upon any prior warrant whereon no survey hath been made, etc. shall hereafter enter, or bring any action for the recovery thereof, unless he, or his ancestors, or predecessors, had the quiet and peaceable possession within seven years before such entry, or bringing such action.' The present case, it is insisted, is plainly described in the law; and the right of Pennsylvania to legislate, in relation to all the lands within her territorial boundary, cannot be denied on general principles, and is not impaired by the terms, or meaning, of her compact with Virginia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. From this review, it was concluded, that the title of the Lessor of the Plaintiff was defective both in law and equity; but admitting, that it was an equitable title, the Counsel for the Defendant urged, that the remedy was in equity, and not at law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The title of the Lessor of the Plaintiff rests on the Virginia warrant, and entry, coupled with the Pennsylvania: survey no patent has been issued by either State; and the compact between them, though it gave a right to have the title completed, did not ipso facto complete it. On this statement, therefore, it is contended, that the legal estate has not yet been vested in the Lessor of the Plaintiff; and that a court of equity is alone competent to supply the defect of the conveyance. It is true, that in Pennsylvania, where no Municipal Court of equity exists, necessity has compelled the judges to apply a legal remedy in every instance of an equitable title; but the same necessity does not occur in a case before the federal tribunals, which have an equitable, as well as a legal, jurisdiction; and the act of Congress, that adopts the laws of the several States, as rules of decision, does not adopt their forms of action, nor their modes of proceeding. 1 Vol.p. 74. s. 34.(Swift's Edit.) A contract made in Pennsylvania may furnish a subject for litigation in any country upon earth; and though the law of Pennsylvania would be regarded in expounding the contract, wherever the litigation took place, the remedies of that place, and not the judicial remedies of Pennsylvania, would be applied to investigate and enforce it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If it is only an equitable title, will the legal process of an ejectment afford a plain, adequate, and compleat remedy? 1 vol. Laws of Cong. p. 95. s. 16. (Swift's edit.) Ejectment is merely a possessory action: a judgment in favor of the Lessor of the Plaintiff will not cure the defect in his title. But a Court of equity could decree the Defendant to convey to the Plaintiff; the only remedy that can be compleat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It will be said, however, that a warrant and survey constitute a legal title in Pennsylvania: but the position is incorrectly taken, by confounding the nature of the estate, with the necessity which compels the use of a legal remedy, for effectuating justice. The application of a legal remedy to protect an equitable estate, still leaves the estate an equitable one. The principle applies to a variety of cases, as well as to the present. Thus, where an estate is held simply by articles of agreement, covenanting to convey, the widow of the covenantee shall be endowed by the law of Pennsylvania: where the Trustee sells the estate for a valuable consideration, without notice of the trust, the grantee shall hold it: And, generally, where there is an equitable estate, it shall descend like a legal estate. 2 Dall. Rep. 205. But never was it conceived, that a legal estate, and an equitable estate, were synonimous terms in Pennsylvania; or that a warrant and survey came within the former description. A warrant was merely a direction from the Proprietary, authorising a survey of the lands specified. It contained no words of grant; and after the survey was made and returned, a patent became essential, not only to the title of the Patentee, but to declare and secure the proprietary purchase money, quit-rents, reservations of mines etc. Till the patent issued, the terms of the bargain were not settled; nor had the proprietary parted with the fee: And is it just or legal to contend, that the proprietary could never evict a warrantee, who refused to pay the price of the lands, and to enter into the usual stipulations of the patent; or that the legal estate could exist in two persons, the proprietary and the warrantee, at the same time? The practice of Pennsylvania, in the application of legal remedies to equitable rights, has given rise, perhaps, to a seeming confusion of ideas and expressions, in the decisions that have occurred on the subject; but it does not appear in the report of Fothergill's Lessee vs. Stover, 1 Dall. Rep. 6. whether the Defendant's was a legal or an equitable title; and in McCurdy vs. Potts et al. 2 Dall. Rep. 98. it is probable that the words 'legal possession' were inadvertantly used by the Judge, or the Reporter, instead of the words 'lawful possession,' since the case naturally points at the latter; and a possession may, certainly be lawful, without being legal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the whole, it was insisted, that the Lessor of the Plaintiff had no right that could in law or equity divest the possession of the Defendant, whose title was compleat in all its parts a Legislative grant, carried into effect by a regular survey and patent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Counsel for the Lessor of the Plaintiff, answered the objections to his title, and to his remedy, under the following general considerations: 1st. His rights before the compact between Virginia and Pennsylvania: 2nd. The true construction of that compact: 3rd. The right of the Lessor of the Plaintiff to be relieved in the present form of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I. The right of the Lessor of the Plaintiff before the compact between Virginia and Pennsylvania, is undoubtedly, founded on the previous right of William Douglas, under the Proclamation of 1763; but the right of William Douglas is no longer questionable, since the special verdict expressly finds the fact, that 'by the Proclamation the King gave to him, his heirs, and assigns, a right to a bounty of 5000 acres of land.' When it is found that he took by virtue of the Proclamation, it follows that he had complied with all the requisites; for, otherwise he could not so have taken. It is agreed, that if a Jury collect the contents of a deed, and find them, and then find the deed, in haec verba, the Court must regard the deed itself, and not the construction; because, the Jury are not to judge of the law; and the very circumstance of their finding the verdict specially, shews that they disclaim judging of the law, and submit it to the Court. Vaugh. 77. But when a deed contains certain facts, without which the party cannot take, the finding that he did take, and the deed, that shews he could not have taken exclusively of those facts, is a finding of the facts themselves. If upon an inspection of the Proclamation, it should appear to contain no words implying a grant, or to be insufficiently expressed in that respect, it is a matter of law on which the Court will judge; though always with a favourable countenance to support the verdict. Hob. 54. 2. Burr. 700. But the terms of the grant are unequivocal; the power of the Crown to make the grant was incontrovertible; the description of the persons to receive it, is comprehensive and plain; and the finding of the Jury settles the right of the Lessor of the Plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having considered the operation of the Proclamation, connected with the finding of the special verdict, to vest a right in William Douglas, the next step is to trace the course of the title from him to the Lessor of the Plaintiff, under the sanction of the laws of Virginia; which, even after the Revolution, fulfilled the intentions of the Royal donor, with liberality and justice. Wythe. Rep. 40. Washington's Rep. 230. For the general gift of the Proclamation was not reduced to specific appropriation until the Royal authority had ceased; and until Virginia, had she been unjust, or even ungenerous, might have refused a compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first and second laws of Virginia, both enacted in May, 1779, before the Lessor of the Plaintiff had taken out a warrant, ought to be considered together. The first law, it is true, excludes claims for military services, unless the service was performed by an inhabitant of Virginia, or in a Virginia corps: but the special verdict does not exclude the possibility that Douglas was an inhabitant of Virginia, although it finds that the corps in which he served was raised in New Jersey. It is not necessary, however, to resort to this hypothesis, since the meaning of the inhabitancy here spoken of, is expounded in the second law, so as to meet precisely the case of the Plaintiff. But the first law substantiates, at least, the assignability of military rights, inasmuch as the first section, after classing, charter or importation rights, treasury rights, and military rights, expressly entitles the heirs and assigns of each class, to take out and locate warrants. The principle runs throughout the law: The fifth section provides that officers, etc. or their assignees may locate their claims on waste and unappropriated lands; and the eleventh section provides, that certain regulations shall not extend 'to officers, soldiers, or their assignees, claiming lands for military service.' These passages embrace all military rights; and whatever may have been the necessity of a personal application of the Donee, under the Proclamation of the British King, it is thus obviously dispensed with by the Legislature of Virginia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under an erroneous interpretation of the first law, however, inhabitants of Virginia had paid their money, in numerous instances, for what might be denominated foreign rights, rights of persons, who never inhabited the State, and never served in a corps belonging to it. Discovering the error, the Legislature deemed it just and politic to come to the aid of the purchasers, being her own citizens; and by the second law virtually ratified their purchases. Without keeping this policy in view, without admitting such claims, as the claim of the Lessor of the Plaintiff, some words of the law of October, 1779, will be nugatory. A Virginian, serving in a New Jersey corps, or a citizen of New Jersey serving in a Virginia corps, would have been entitled under the preceding law; but a third description was to be favoured, the Virginia purchasers of military rights; and hence the phraseology of 'he, she, or they,' which cannot refer to the officers or soldiers, but to their assigns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after the law of October, 1779, was passed, within the period of eight months, the Lessor of the Plaintiff obtained his warrant, and entered it, with a location on Montour's island, in the Register's office. The warrant, entry, and location, are all in conformity to the laws and practice of Virginia. The description of the island possesses sufficient certainty; and it is found by the verdict to be on the north-west side of the Ohio, not within any prohibited district of country. From the 20th of June 1780, when the law enacted that all proceedings to execute warrants on the disputed territory, should be suspended until the compact and cession to Pennsylvania, it was impossible for the Lessor of the Plaintiff to pursue any measures for effectuating his title: but his rights were not impaired, nor was the warrant annihilated, because it was not executed and returned; and the subsequent survey of Neville and Ritchie amounted to an entry and possession on behalf of the Lessor of the Plaintiff. There is, perhaps, no decision in Virginia that places a warrant and location on the footing of a legal title; but a military warrant has always been deemed a good equitable right. Wythe's Rep. 40. Washington's Rep. 230.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has been contended, however, that the non payment of .40 per hundred acres, either to Virginia or Pennsylvania, within the stipulated period of six months, amounts to an abandonment or forfeiture of all the pre-existing rights of the Lessor of the Plaintiff. But the special verdict finds a usage directly opposed to this construction; and usage is a safe expositor of the law. The fraud intended to be guarded against was the issuing of two warrants for one claim; and the Court will not presume that more than one had issued upon the present claim, in which case the 40 was never required, or exacted, for a warrant founded on military services. But it is impossible to consider the provision as applying to lands in this predicament for the following reasons: 1st. Before the expiration of the six months which the law, passed on the 20th of June, 1780, (2 Vol. St. L. 208. Dall. Edit.) allowed, the lands, and the right to the price, were ceded by Virginia to Pennsylvania, to wit&#8212;on the 23rd of June, 1789. From the time of her cession Virginia had no right to the price; and Pennsylvania never fixed a time for paying it, nor imposed a penalty for a neglect, or refusal. If, then, the performance of a condition becomes impossible by the act of the party, he shall never himself take advantage of the failure. Doug. 659. 2nd. By suspending the powers of the Commissioners, in relation to the execution of warrants, within the disputed territory, those lands were virtually excepted from the general provision of the act. It is harsh, indeed, to subject a man to a penalty for not paying for lands, which he could neither locate, nor possess. If the forfeiture does not apply, the result is, that the money, if payable at all, must be paid, before a patent can be obtained. Virginia thought the warrant still in force, for, it was certified in the list transmitted by her Executive; and Pennsylvania has, also, manifested her opinion on the subject, by issuing a patent for the lands located on Racoon creek, under circumstances exactly similar. It is here proper to add, that, although the law was passed during a session, which commenced on the 1st of May 1780, it was not, in fact, enacted till the 20th of June 1780; so that it can have no effect to invalidate the warrant and location, which were made by the Lessor of the Plaintiff, on the 8th, and 30th of May, respectively. The relation of laws to the first day of the session of the Legislature, is a legal fiction, which will never be allowed to work an injury. Comb. 431. 2 Mod. 310.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But it is another objection, that Montour's Island lay within the country which belonged to the Indians; and could not, therefore, be the subject of a lawful location under a private warrant. Without confessing the aboriginal title of the Indian tribes, it is enough for the lessor of the Plaintiff to alledge, upon the finding of the special verdict, that before the year 1779, they had abandoned and relinquished all the lands except on the north-west side of the Ohio; and that in pursuance of treaties, they have since receded very distantly from that boundary. Lands may be acquired by conquest; and a relinquishment, in consequence of hostilities, is tantamount to conquest<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-4\" id=\"fn-s-4_ref\">*</a>. 2 Bl. C. 9. The lands are, likewise, found to have been within the charter boundaries of Virginia; so that as far as royal jurisdiction, and Indian surrender, are involved, the sovereignty and property of that state were complete. It is said, however, that after this dereliction, possession should have been taken; and here too the special verdict meets the objection, by finding that the lands mentioned in the declaration were included in the bounds of Yohagany County.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not honorable to the character, nor consistent with the practice, of Pennsylvania, to urge the treaty at Fort Stanwix in the year 1784, as a proof that the Indian title had not been previously extinguished. Rather, let it be said, that she purchased tranquility from the Indians, for the benefit of all, who held lands within their hunting grounds; and that the deed enured to their use, for their respective proportions, and to her use only for the residuum. Besides, the Virginia rights were original charges on the land, which she was bound to support and defend; and the success of her operations, whether by treaty or by arms, could never abridge or destroy them. It does not now lie with her to dispute the right of Virginia, even if usurped; for, she is estopped by her own act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. This leads to a second general consideration, what is the true construction of the Compact between Virginia and Pennsylvania? The compact was ratified by the former the 23rd of June 1780; by the latter on the 23rd of September 1780; when it became mutually obligatory, and neither State could afterwards disable herself from complying with its terms. On the contrary, indeed, each party was bound to the other, and to the individuals concerned, that every necessary act should be performed to effectuate the objects of the agreement and cession. That no private right, antecedently acquired, should be dimished or destroyed, was expressly contemplated; and with that view, the list of entries in the Land Office of Virginia, was transmitted by the executive of that state to the executive of Pennsylvania; with that view the lift was communicated to the Land Officers and surveyors of Pennsylvania; with that view all the precautions were taken, which appear in the records of the executive council and of the board of property; and with that view Neville and Ritchie surveyed and returned a draft of the island in favor of the lessor of the Plaintiff. Previously, however, to the Virginia list of warrantees, though after the Compact, the legislature of Pennsylvania, by a law, enacted the 24th September, 1783, had granted the pre-emption of Montour's Island to the Defendant; but in doing this, it must have been remembered, that the premises lay within the disputed territory; and, therefore, with a laudable caution, a proviso was inserted, 'that nothing in the act shall be taken or deemed to bar any person, or persons, their heirs or assigns, who may have obtained any just or lawful right to the said island, or any part thereof, before the passing of the act.' 2 Vol. 150. s. 4. (Dall. Edit.) It is said, that the list transmitted by the Governor of Virginia does not specify the location of Montour's Island; but it is found that the lift on which Neville and Ritchie made their survey for the lessor of the Plaintiff, did comprise the lands mentioned in the declaration; and the Defendant had full notice of the Virginia claim, before he paid any part of his purchase money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having, then, precisely ascertained the spot by the location, (and in the present case, a survey was unnecessary, either to identify the island, or to ascertain the quantity of land it contained) the Lessor of the Plaintiff required a right under Virginia, which wanted no other form or act than the ratification of the compact, to make it complete. That ratification is accordingly given on the express condition 'that the private property and rights of all persons acquired under, founded on, or recognized by, the laws of either country, previous to the date hereof, be saved and confirmed to them, although they shall be found to fall within the other.' The right of the Lessor of the Plaintiff, it is repeated, was acquired under, founded on, and recognized by the laws of Virginia, and that right is not only saved, but confirmed by a covenant or law of Pennsylvania. That a new warrant was not necessary after the cession, is proved by the proceedings on the Virginia location upon Racoon creek; and there is no magic in the description of a patent, which may not be supplied by something equivalent; as, in the present case, by a solemn compact. The property of the island originally belonged to one or other of the states; one of them grants it to the Lessor of the Plaintiff; and the other confirms the grant; what form of conveyance can be more effectual and conclusive? Co. Litt. 295. b. (1.) Ibid. 301. b. Ib. 302. a. 2 Dall. Rep. 98.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this view of the subject, it is easy to dispose of other objections that the Defendant's counsel have suggested: Thus, the act of limitations (2 Vol. 282. Dall. edit.) relates only to Pennsylvania warrants, or improvement rights; whereas the Lessor of the Plaintiff claims entirely under a Virginia warrant. Again: the reservation and exception of islands in the Ohio from applications for warrants and surveys, can only operate where the islands belong to Pennsylvania; they are reserved and excepted from applications under a particular section of the law, but not from applications founded on a previous lien; and there is a saving of the Defendants pre-emption right, which is virtually, and by reference to the proviso in his grant, a saving of the right of the Lessor of the Plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the title of the Defendant, (though the Lessor of the Plaintiff must succeed upon the strength of his own title, and not by the weakness of his antagonist's) it may be permitted generally to observe, that it is founded on a grant made out of the usual course; that it is made subject to all previous rights; that the patent was taken out with express notice of the Virginia right: and that, under such circumstances, if the Lessor of the Plaintiff has a good title, the Defendant's patent must be merely void.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III. But it remains to consider the right of the Lessor of the Plaintiff to be relieved in the present form of action: And it is surely extraordinary, after his suit has actually been dismissed in equity, because his remedy in Pennsylvania was at law, that he should now be told, that he must fail at law, because his remedy is in equity-doomed to be forever suspended between the two jurisdictions, like Mahomet's coffin between heaven and earth! But the title of the Lessor of the Plaintiff is a legal title; and even if it were only an equitable title, the remedy by ejectment is the only one in Pennsylvania.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-5\" id=\"fn-s-5_ref\">*</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 34th section of the judicial act (I Vol. 74. Swift's edit.) adopts the laws of the several states, as rules of decision in trials at common law: Now, as in England the laws are defined to be general customs, local customs, and acts of Parliament; 1 Bl. C. 63. so in Pennsylvania, the laws must be defined to be the common law, as modified by practice, and acts of the General Assembly. If, therefore, a plain, adequate, and complete remedy can be had at law, according to the laws of Pennsylvania, the Lessor of the Plaintiff is not entitled to resort to a Court of Equity. Such a remedy can be had, to the extent of the present demand. A Plaintiff may (consistently with the principles of law) frame his demand for the whole, or for a part, of his right: he may claim a portion of it, as possession of the estate, at law; and, if he thinks it necessary, he may resort to equity for a conveyance, or an injunction, to fortify and secure his possession. The Lessor of the Plaintiff asserts a legal right of possession; and an action of ejectment is a possessory remedy. 3 Bl. C. 205. 180. 1 Burr. It is immaterial, how minute his interest is, if it is a legal interest; Run. 9. and it may easily be shown that the title is a legal title in Pennsylvania, against the state, and against all claimers under the state. By the charter of Pennsylvania, the system of feudal tenures was recognized; and lands were held in soccage, so that seizen was a technical principle originally incorporated into the tenure of our estates; but what constitutes a seizen, is, perhaps, still as uncertain, as it was formerly thought to be by Lord Mansfield, who says in a general definition, that 'seizen is a technical term, to denote the completion of that investiture, by which the tenant was admitted into the tenure; and without which, no freehold could be constituted or pass.' 1 Burr. 60. 107. To effectuate this seizen, shorter and easier modes by deeds executed, acknowledged and recorded, were soon adopted in Pennsylvania, than feoffments at common law, or conveyances under the statute of uses: 1 Vol. Penn. Laws. p. III. s. 5. (Dall. edit.) Ibid. in Appendix. p. 27. 8. And though these modes alone are adopted by positive statutes, long usage has given the same force and effect to other evidences of title; as a warrant and survey; a contract to purchase lands, and payment, or tender, of the consideration; which give a legal estate, and produce all the consequences of a feoffment; namely, dower, tenancy by the curtesy, forfeiture, escheat etc. 2 Dall. Rep. 98. But the title of the Lessor of the Plaintiff, though it sprung from the Proclamation, and though it is fortified by the usage of Pennsylvania will be found, on still higher ground, to be a legal title: it emanates from the Legislature, and therefore from the Commonwealth; it is, emphatically, a Law, and, therefore, superior to any mere Executive exemplification: it is a public covenant; it must be construed as a patent from the sovereign; and wherever two constructions arise on any instrument of grant or confirmation, that which gives effect to it shall prevail. 9 Co. 131. a. 10 Co. 67. b. 9 Co. 27. b. 6 Co. 6. a.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this mode of granting, it is, also, to be remarked, a legal title only can be derived; for, where a title of an equitable nature arises, it must be supported by an express, or implied, trust in the grantor; and in relation to a sovereign, or to a corporation, the strict rules of the common law will not allow either to stand in the predicament of a trustee. 2 Bac. Abr. II. tit. 'Corporation' (5th edit.) Gilb. T. Uses and trusts. 5. 170. Founding the rights of the Lessor of the Plaintiff on legal principles, there is no pretence for considering the Defendant as his trustee, under a patent afterwards obtained, and which is merely void. But words of grant used in the Legislative act of a Republican Government, such as the compact, must always be construed to pass the legal estate, unless a trustee is expressly appointed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Chief Justice, on the last day of the term, delivered the opinion of the court as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ellsworth Chief Justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appears that William Douglass, for services rendered, acquired under the King's Proclamation of 1763, a right to 5000 acres of unappropriated land in America; which right he assigned to Charles Sims, the lessor of the Plaintiff below. And although by the terms of the proclamation, the personal application of Douglass was requisite to obtain a land warrant on the said right, yet the laws of Virginia, passed subsequent to her independence, dispensed with such personal application, and made a warrant issuable to the assignee, Sims, he being an inhabitant of that state on the 3rd of May, 1779. A warrant he accordingly obtained, and the same duly located on Montour's Island, the land in question; which his warrant was more than sufficient to cover, and which, from its description as an island, was perfectly aparted and distinguished from all other land. By which means Sims acquired to the said island a complete equitable title, and one which needed only a patent of confirmation to render it a complete legal title. A confirmation of this equitable title, as effectual as that of any patent could have been, was afterwards comprised in the compact between Virginia and Pennsylvania, and in the ratification of the same by the legislative act of the latter. The terms therein of 'reserve and confirmation' of the 'rights' which had been previously acquired under Virginia, in the territory thereby relinquished to Pennsylvania, must, from the nature of the transaction, be expounded favorably for those rights, and so that titles, before substantially good, should not after a change of jurisdiction, be defeated or questioned for formal defects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It further appears, that Sims, since the said compact and ratification, has, without any laches that would prejudice his claim, obtained a legal survey of the said land under Pennsylvania: In which state, payment, or as in this case consideration passed, and a survey though unaccompanied by a patent, give a legal right of entry, which is sufficient in ejectment. Why they have been adjudged to give such right, whether from a defect of Chancery powers, or for other reasons of policy or justice, is not now material. The right once having become an established legal right, and having incorporated itself as such, with property and tenures, it remains a legal right notwithstanding any new distribution of judicial powers, and must be regarded by the common law courts of the United States, in Pennsylvania, as a rule of decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Judgment of the Circuit Court affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-2_ref\">*</a>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Iredell, Justice.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though I concur with the other Judges of the Court in affirming the Judgment of the Circuit Court, yet as I differ from them in the reasons for affirmance, I think it proper to state my opinion particularly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to do this with the greater distinctness, it is necessary that I should observe upon the nature of this title according to my ideas of it, from its origin to what may be deemed its consummation, at least for the purpose of maintaining this ejectment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My observations, therefore, will be under the following heads of inquiry:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1st.

Whether it sufficiently appears that William Douglas was entitled to a military right, such as it was, under the Proclamation of 1763?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though the finding be not altogether so correct as it might have been, yet I think it may be fairly inferred that William Douglas had all the requisites to entitle him to a military right under that Proclamation, especially as the Jury have said generally that the King gave to him the right in question by that Proclamation, which could not have been in fact true had any of the requisites been wanting, and though a general finding inconsistent with a particular one cannot stand, yet I am of opinion a particular finding consistent with a general one may.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next question is,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Whether the right of Douglas was assignable under the Royal Government, or since?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grant was general to all who were the objects of it, and required only evidence of proper service, and the usual steps towards obtaining a grant under any of the then Provinces. The Royal faith was pledged, that in such a case a grant should issue. It was immaterial, at that time, in what province the grant was obtained, as all belonged equally to the Crown. The grant was for meritorious services already performed, and therefore it was an interest, though in some degree indefinite in its nature, sanctioned by every principle of moral obligation, and such as the party entitled might, on the most solemn principles of public justice, confidently demand. Upon a large scale, the Crown was certainly a trustee for all those persons to whom its faith was pledged; and, therefore, so far as no particular prerogative of the Crown interfered, it was rational to consider it in the light of any other trust. It has been doubtful whether the Crown could in any case be a trustee, so as to be the object of any municipal decision, but the law could never presume (however the fact may be) that the Crown would not faithfully perform any trust belonging to it. The only difference between that and a private trust, is, that the latter is clearly enforcible by a Court of Equity; the former perhaps must be left to the conscience of the Crown itself. But this makes no difference in the nature of the interest. If this had been a private trust, it would at least have amounted to what in Equity is called a possibility, and it has been long settled that a possibility is assignable in Equity for a valuable consideration. I see no reason why that principle cannot apply here. The necessity of a personal application was undoubtedly indispensible under the Royal government; but the two things are, in my opinion, perfectly compatible. Suppose such an assignment had been made, a personal application was still necessary, and very probably for the judicious reasons assigned at the Bar; but after the grant, obtained on such personal application, if the interest had been fairly assigned before, the assignee would have been entitled to a conveyance. If none had been made, which would have been an acknowledgment of the fairness of the transaction, Chancery only could have been applied to, to compel a conveyance. The assignor or his heir would then have had to answer on oath, and an examination of all particulars might have been made, after which, if the Court had entertained the least doubt of the fairness of the transaction, they would not have ordered a conveyance. This would be a sufficient guard against fraud. But the assignment previous to an actual grant might have been necessary even to save an officer from starving. How hard would have been his condition, if he could have made no immediate use of a bounty of the Crown, expressly intended as a provision for him, but which circumstances might prevent his receiving for years?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus the case stood, as I conceive, under the Royal government. By the Revolation, the circumstances of it were, in some degree, changed, but not so as, in my opinion, materially to alter the nature of the title in this respect. The duty of the Crown, substantially, devolved on the several States, who became possessed of the territory formerly belonging wholly to the Crown; but as it might be an unreasonable thing to burden any one State with the whole of these provisions, some modification of the title might be expected so as to prevent this injury. This, however, does not seem to afford any reason why it should not remain an assignable interest, subject to the restriction I mentioned before, in case a personal application was still insisted upon, which it was undoubtedly optional in the States to require, or not. I therefore am of opinion, that the interest still remained assignable, subject only to such regulations as each State might think proper to require.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next subject of enquiry is,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3rd. Whether the Lessor of the Plaintiff in the ejectment had a title, and if any, of what nature it was, under the laws of Virginia?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I confess I have had great difficulty in construing the two Virginia acts, of May, and October, 1779, and if the latter act had admitted of such a construction that I could, without absurdity or manifest injustice have confined the words 'or assigns' in that act, to mean only the heirs or assigns of those specially named in the former, I should undoubtedly have preferred that construction; because in the last act of May, 1779, the Virginia Legislature expressly designated the objects, for whom they meant to provide; and whatever I might think of that provision (though I am far from thinking it an unjust one) I should deem it unwarranted to extend it to any others by construction of a subsequent law, without plain words of extension, unless there was an irresistible implication to authorise it. Such an implication, I think, exists here. The first act specifies the various objects of its provision. 1st. Those who had obtained a Warrant from the Governor of Virginia, under the former government. 2nd. Where the service was performed by an inhabitant of Virginia. 3rd. Where the service was performed in some regiment or corps actually raised in Virginia. The act of October, 1779, introduces a new provision for some persons or other, viz. a residence in Virginia at the passing of the former act (the 3rd of May, 1779,) but they expressly except from the operation of this provision those who had obtained warrants under the former government, and those who had performed military service in some regiment or corps actually raised in Virginia, and had served under the circumstances particularly described in the act. They also except persons who had obtained a title under any former warrant. They do not, however, except in any manner one description of persons, who were provided for in the former law, viz. persons who were inhabitants of Virginia, and had performed military service in some other than a Virginia regiment or corps, unless they or some persons claiming under them had previously obtained a warrant for it. But the act affords no indication from which we have a right to infer, that the Legislature meant to repeal any of the provisions in the former law; and if they did not, then upon the construction of the Council for the Plaintiff in Error, the provision, as to the persons I have last mentioned, in plain English would stand thus: 'We are willing to reward the services of any of the inhabitants of our own particular state, when under the Royal government, by giving full effect to the Royal proclamation, by which the faith of the former government was pledged, provided the person, his heirs, or assigns, actually resided in Virginia on the 3rd of May, 1779. But if such person moved out of this State before that day, or died and left heirs or assigns, who either never resided in Virginia, or did not actually reside there on the auspicious 3rd of May, 1779, he, she, or they, shall receive nothing for such service.' Such a provision would undoubtedly be highly rediculous, for the grant under the proclamation was for services actually past, services of a highly meritorious nature, the risque of life, and sacrifice of private ease, by entering into the army at a critical period, for the defence of their country; and to such persons certainly no additional merit could attach by a residence in Virginia on the 3rd of May, 1779. I therefore am compelled, upon principles of respect to the Legislature, to abandon this construction; and then there remains no other but to suppose, that they meant to provide by implication for a new description of persons (though under negative, informal, and incorrect words,) viz. persons who had fairly obtained titles under any military grant, though not of the special description before enumerated, if such person, his heirs, or assigns, actually resided in Virginia on the 3rd of May 1779. Willing, in short, to confirm all fair purchases made by permanent, not occasional, residents in Virginia, (of which the residence at that time should be a test) when they might innocently have supposed, either that Virginia was bound to provide for all military rights presented, or would be disposed upon a large and liberal scale to do so, and had thus laid out their money from a kind of indefinite confidence in the future conduct of their own Legislature: And the word 'hereafter' that has been commented upon (in the 3rd section. of the act of the 3rd of May, 1779,) and the express saving in the act of October, 1779, of all titles under warrants formerly issued, independent of the saving of titles under warrants from the former government, seem strongly to favour this construction. By construing the act in this manner, though some difficulties yet remain, they are, in my opinion, fewer than upon the other construction; and as they are more consistent with equity, justice, and common sense, I deem it my duty as a Judge, to support the construction which will tolerate these, in preference to one which is attended with greater difficulties, and accompanied with absurdity and injustice: especially, as that construction will make both acts consistent in their main objects, and the other (without any indication from the apparent meaning of the Legislature) would amount to an express repeal of an important provision; and nearly in effect revoke a grant actually made, which, if within the competence of a Legislature, is undoubtedly one of the most odious acts of its power, and which nothing but absolute necessity should force us to say they intended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The title, therefore, so far, under the laws of Virginia, I think was a vested right. But it seems to me now material to enquire, whether the title under the laws of Virginia was complete or incomplete. It is admitted, that a patent was regularly necessary to complete the title, even had a survey been made, and it is at least doubtful whether a warrant and survey would have given any legal right of possession at all. But in this case, it is contended, a survey was not necessary, for two reasons: 1. Because the location of an island was certain, and the whole island would not exceed the quantity he was entitled to. 2. Because no money was to have been paid upon it. These reasons do not satisfy me that a survey was unnecessary. A survey I consider in all instances to be highly useful, in order that it may be officially ascertained, and officially known, not only what land in particular is taken up, but also its exact quantity, so far as it is material to specify it, for the information of the public, from whom the grant is to be obtained, as well as that of any individual who may have interfering claims or pretensions. The private knowledge of a few particular persons who may know the spot thoroughly, is by no means equal to the authentic information which an actual survey, a regular report, and a correct record, can convey; and the instances are so very few, where exact information can otherwise be obtained, that there is no occasion for the sake of those to make an exception: It would do no good, and might lead to endless difficulties. I think, therefore, the necessity of a survey ought to be deemed general and indispensible, and there being none in this case previous to the compact made with Pennsylvania, the title so far was incomplete. But I admit, had a survey been unnecessary, and had such steps been taken in Virginia as would, of course, have intitled the Defendant in error to a patent, then the compact and the act of confirmation in consequence might have been deemed a complete and perfect assurance of it, and as effectual as if a patent had been actually granted before the compact under the laws of Virginia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the payment of 40. it is clear to me, that as that was meant as full purchase money for land, to which the person who entered had no right before, it never can apply to a case where the grant was for service already performed, unless the Legislature had wanted both common sense and common honesty. I have not hesitated a moment to reject that construction, the words in no manner requiring it, and easily admitting of the construction given by the counsel for the Defendant in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The finding in this case, I think, sufficiently establishes a relinquishment of the Indian title previous to the year 1779, so as to authorize an entry and location in the river Ohio, at the times the entry and location on behalf of the Defendant in error took place, without a violation of any duty either to a particular State or to the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I come now to the next head of inquiry,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Whether the Defendant in error had any title, subsequent to the compact under the laws of Pennsylvania?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I do not consider that this compact, and the act in confirmation of it, immediately converted all inchoate and imperfect rights under Virginia into absolute and perfect ones under Pennsylvania, but that the intention was, such as the title was under Virginia, it should substantially be under Pennsylvania, in preference to any younger right that might have been obtained in any manner under Pennsylvania. If the manner of proceeding on both sides was the same, then the Virginia claimant had nothing to do, but to proceed under the laws of the latter, as if his original title had been obtained from Pennsylvania. If the manner of proceeding in both States had been different, then I should have supposed it would have been proper for Pennsylvania to pass a new law adequate to this new case, that the faith of the State might have been duly observed. But I conceive under both States a survey was indispensible, the same reasons which I have urged on this subject, in considering the case of the Virginia right, applying equally to both States. The survey that was accordingly had under the State of Pennsylvania I think was a valid one, notwithstanding the objection as to the bed of the river, for as the law is general, (such at least it appears to me) that where two countries, or two counties, border on a navigable river, the middle of the bed of the river is the boundary line, I see nothing in this case to prove it an exception, and consequently the survey appears to have been made by the proper authority. With regard to the objection that in the ninth finding it is stated, that the Governor of Virginia transmitted in 1784 a just and true list of entries made under the authority of Virginia in the disputed territory, in which list the island in question is not comprehended, and therefore the verdict impliedly excludes it, I answer, 1st, If the Governor had or had not transmitted a perfect list, this could not have deprived any party really entitled of showing a title which had been omitted, either designedly (though that could not be presumed, but I state it as the strongest case) or inadvertently, on the part of the Governor, where at least an adverse claimant under Pennsylvania was not prejudiced by such omission, but had early and sufficient notice of the prior right, before he had completed his own. 2nd. It may be a true list, so far as it goes, but not perfect for want of a complete knowledge of all particulars, some of which might have been omitted to be ascertained in the usual and proper manner. 3rd. The implication in this case cannot have the effect contended for, because the tenth finding refers to that list, as including the entry and location of the Defendant in error, and the fourth finding declares, that two Deputy Surveyors under the Surveyor General of Pennsylvania did in 1785 receive from the Surveyor General's office, a list of entries made under the authority of Virginia, which list included the entry for the land in the declaration mentioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The survey being in my opinion good, though it was subsequent to the grant to the Plaintiff in error, shall be deemed to relate to the time of taking out the warrant, not only in consequence of the compact, which secured all prior rights of Virginia, and the act in confirmation of it, but also on account of the express saving of all prior rights in the grant to the Plaintiff in error by the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, who seem to have guarded with solicitude against any supposed breach of public faith, and therefore it is immaterial to enquire, what would have been the case had Pennsylvania expressly violated it. But where a Legislature has constitutional authority to pass any law, I can conceive a manifest distinction between right and power; between the obligation on the part of the Legislature, upon principles of morality, to give effect to a solemn compact, and their, in fact, making a law in violation of it, which it is the duty of the Courts to obey. The Legislature is restricted indeed in this particular by the constitution of the United States; and a treaty of the United States is, by its own authority, de facto, as well as morally, binding, while it continues in force, because it shall be the supreme law of the land. But until this constitution did pass, I should doubt very much, whether if the Legislature had actually violated the compact, the Court could here set up the compact against the law, upon principles which I have stated at large in my argument on the subject of the British debts, and to which I beg leave to refer, as it is now publishing in Mr. Dallas's Reports.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-6\" id=\"fn-s-6_ref\">*</a> I say this only incidentally, on account of observations on this subject at the bar, in which I by no means acquiesce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The warrant and survey being thus by me deemed complete and unexceptionable, under the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the only remaining enquiry is,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. Whether if the Defendant in error had a title, it was such as was sufficient to maintain this ejectment?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two objections are stated under this head.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. That the title, such as it is, is only an equitable, not a legal one, and therefore will not maintain an ejectment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. That it is not brought within proper time, but is barred by the Statute of limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first objection, did this title stand merely as an equitable one, I should strongly incline against it, if not deem it altogether insufficient. It is of infinite moment, in my opinion, that principles of law and equity should not be confounded, otherwise inextricable confusion will arise, neither will be properly understood; and instead of both being administered with useful guards, which the policy of each system has devised against abuse, an heterogeneous mass of principles, not intended to assort with each other, will be blended together, and the substance of justice will soon follow the forms calculated to secure it. I totally reject all the modern cases introduced by Lord Mansfield, and supported by some other Judges, but lately, wisely, as I conceive, discountenanced by the present Court of King's Bench, of taking notice of a Cestui que trust at all in any other right than as holding in fact possession, with the concurrence of the legal Trustee. So far, consistent with legal principles, a Court may go, but not, as I conceive, one step further, and that it violates the most important principles of the common law to consider a Cestui que trust as having an iota of legal right against the Trustee himself. Whatever excuse a Court may have for doing this, when the want of a Court of equity may urge them to procure substantial justice, by a deviation from legal strictness as to form, I should hesitate long, before I should deem myself warranted in assenting to such a practice, when both powers are vested in the very same Court, but each has different modes of proceeding prescribed to it. But I think we are relieved from any dilemma of this kind, by strong and unequivocal declarations of highly respectable gentlemen of long experience in this State, that a warrant and survey, where no money remained to be paid, and a patent was only to ascertain that all previous requisites had been complied with, has been uniformly deemed a legal title, as opposed to an equitable one; and has all the consequences as such, even as to Dower, which affords a strong presumption in favor of the supposed legal title, for it has been so long held (though I think erroneously at first) that there should be no Dower of a trust estate, that perhaps no Judge would be warranted in a Court of Chancery in allowing it. Whether this opinion was originally right or not, yet having been the ground of many titles, it would be improper in the Court to shake it. I am not certain, also, but it may properly be considered, that the proprietor under a warrant and survey (according to long usage) is at least in the nature of a tenant at will to the public, and as such has a right of possession against all others, except some person having a better right, claiming under the public, which better right does not, for the reasons I have given, exist in this case, in the Plaintiff in error. This point, however, I merely intimate, it not being necessary to deliver an opinion upon it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another circumstance has occurred to me, which I suggest with dissidence, as it was not spoken to at the bar, that though the compact and confirming act did not render a survey unnecessary, yet when a survey was made, it being a right derived from compact alone, the title ought to stand on that ground alone, and not depend on a patent, which imports a grant by the State, at its own discretion, of property of its own, and seems to imply that the State is the sole agent in the conveyance of the title.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the objection from the statute of limitations, it is sufficient to say, that that act, in my mind, clearly contemplates other objects, and neither in its letter, or spirit, is to be applied to this new and peculiar case; but admitting that it did, the facts in this case do not come within the provisions of it, there appearing to have been no such laches as the act contemplated to prevent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-3_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> The proclamation also contains a provision, prohibiting any grant or purchase of lands occupied by the Indians.
