The plaintiff offered to give evidence of a conversation between Thomas Fleming, the husband of the defendant, under whom she held possession, and Callander, under whom the plaintiff claimed; in which Fleming, declared, 'that he had title to the land in question, taken in execution as his, by the sheriff; and prayed Callander to permit him to continue sometime longer in possession.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was objected, that the admission of the evidence would be setting up a person's own declarations, to give him a title to the land.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, by the Court: Ejectments are possessory actions; and in England it is necessary to shew a possession within twenty years. The plaintiff may, therefore, shew the possession of Mr. Callander, or of any other person under whom he claims, within that term; and, in order to do so, he certainly is at liberty to give proof, that the person, under whom the defendant claims, was, in fact, nothing more than Mr. Callander's Tenant on sufferance.
