I do not know of any privilege to exempt members of congress from the service, or the obligations, of a subpna, in such cases. I will not sign any letter of the kind proposed. If, upon service of a subpna, the members of congress do not attend, a different question may arise; and it will then be time enough to decide, whether an attachment ought, or ought not, to issue. It is not a necessary consequence of nonattendance, after the service of a subpna, that an attachment shall issue. A satisfactory reason may appear to the Court, to justify, or excuse, it.</p>\n<p>PETERS, Justice.</p>\n<p>I know the practice in Pennsylvania to be as it has been stated; for, I have received such letters, from the Supreme Court, while I was speaker of the house of representatives, requesting that members might be permitted to attend as witnesses.
