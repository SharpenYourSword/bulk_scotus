There was a special defence, that the defendant had sold, and conveyed to the plaintiffs, a quantity of land in the county of <i>Northumberland</i>, in satisfaction of their demand; and the deed of conveyance, dated in <i>June</i> 1799, was produced. But the plaintiffs insisted, 1st. That they took the conveyance only as a collateral security: and, 2dly. That they were imposed upon by the defendant, as to the <i>quality</i> of the land.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first point, the evidence was contradictory; and the COURT left it, implicitly, to be decided by the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the second point, it was proved, that the defendant had represented the land as very valuable; saying, that it was such as would sell, in two or three years, for a price, from two to six dollars an acre: but, in fact, the land was a part of a mountain, commonly called '<i>Jack's Second Mountain</i>;' so rude, that it could not be cultivated; and so steep, that it was inaccessible, even to take off the wood, without incalculable expense and labour. In the charge of the COURT, on this point, it was said,</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">By SHIPPEN, <i>Chief Justice</i>:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wherever there is a gross misrepresentation of facts, relating to the subject of a contract, the contract is fraudulent and void.
