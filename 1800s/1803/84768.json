The declaration contained this count only; to which there was a plea of the general issue.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence in support of the declaration, was a promissory note made by Vincent Gray, dated at Alexandria on the 2d of March 1798, by which he promised to pay, sixty days after date, to the order of Mandeville and Jameson 1500 dollars for value received, negotiable at the bank of Alexandria. This note was indorsed by Mandeville and Jameson, to James M'Clenachan, and by him to Joseph Riddle &amp; Co. the defendants in error. The protest of a notary public, made on the 5th of May 1798, attests that he had on that day demanded payment of the note of the maker, who refused, and of Mandeville and Jameson the first indorsers, who also refused; and that James M'Clenachan, the other indorser, did not dwell in his district. The record of a suit on the same note brought by Joseph Riddle &amp; Co. on the 14th of June 1798, against Vincent Gray, the maker, prosecuted to final judgment and execution, upon which execution he was committed to jail and took the oath of an insolvent debtor, and was discharged on the 6th of February 1799.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An exception was taken at the trial in the circuit court to the charge of the court, the same being contrary to the request of the counsel of the defendant below. The court refused to charge the jury, that the action could not be maintained against the defendant, in that court; there being no intermediate indorser between them. This point alone was decided upon this writ of error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of this action, the counsel for the plaintiff in error cited, <i>Kyd on Bills</i>, 175, (113, 114.) Contra were cited, 1 <i>Strange</i>, 479. <i>Esp. N. P.</i> 33. 2 <i>Burr.</i> 674. 2 <i>Freeman</i>, 257. 1 <i>Salk.</i> 126, pl. 5. 1 <i>Burr.</i> 452.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Argument of Counsel from pages 291-297 intentionally omitted]</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only question in this case is, whether an action of indebitatus assumpsit can be maintained by the assignee of a promissory note made in Virginia, against a remote assignor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The act of the Virginia assembly, which makes notes assignable, gives the assignee an action of debt in his own name, against the maker of the note, but is silent with respect to the claim of the assignee against the assignor.
