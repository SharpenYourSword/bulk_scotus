The sum of $21,112 exceeded the debt, as found by the award due by the plaintiffs to John Dunlop &amp; Co.  494. 6<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> Virginia currency.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hepburn and Dundas afterwards tendered to the defendant an assignment of the contract with Graham, but upon condition that John Dunlop &amp; Co. should first sign, seal and deliver, by Colin Auld their attorney, on the same day, a release and acquittance of all the claims and demands of John Dunlop &amp; Co. against the plaintiffs. The defendant refused first to execute the release, and Hepburn and Dundas thereupon refused to assign the contract with Graham, insisting that under the agreement they had a right to have the said release first executed.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The action was instituted by Hepburn and Dundas for the recovery of the sum of  494. 6<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> Virginia currency, the excess as found by the award.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case were presented to the circuit court, by a demurrer on the part of the plaintiffs to the plea of the defendant, in which the same were set forth, and the circuit court gave judgment for the defendant on the demurrer. The plaintiffs then prosecuted this writ of error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Argument of Counsel from pages 322-329 intentionally omitted]</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To entitle themselves to the money for which this suit was instituted, it is incumbent on the plaintiffs to show that they have performed the very act, on the performance of which the money became payable; or that they are excused by the conduct of the defendant for its non-performance.
