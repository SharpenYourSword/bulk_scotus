Lee</i> and <i>Swann,</i> contra.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*88</span> <i>Wednesday, February</i> 27.</h2>\n<p>MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>The first point made in this case, by the attorney for the United States, is, that the deed of the 16th of January, 1799, is fraudulent as to creditors generally.</p>\n<p>It is not alleged that the consideration was feigned, or that there was any secret trust between the parties. The transaction is admitted to have been, in truth, what it purports to be; but it is contended that the deed, on its face, is fraudulent as to creditors.</p>\n<p>The deed is made to save Hooe harmless on account of his having become the security of Fitzgerald to the United States, and on account of notes to be indorsed by Hooe for the accommodation of Fitzgerald, in the bank of Alexandria.</p>\n<p>These are purposes for which it is supposed this deed of trust could not lawfully have been executed; and the deed has been pronounced fraudulent under the statute of 13<i>th of Elizabeth.</i></p>\n<p>That statute contains a proviso, that it shall not extend to conveyances made upon <i>good consideration,</i> and <i>bona</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*89</span> <i>fide.</i> The goodness of the consideration, in the case at bar, has been admitted; but it is alleged that the conveyance is not <i>bona fide;</i> and for this, <i>Twyne's</i> case has been principally relied on. But in that case, the intent was believed by the court to be fraudulent, and in this case it is admitted not to have been fraudulent. It is contended, that all the circumstances from which fraud was inferred in that case, are to be found in this; but the court can find between them no trait of similitude. In <i>that</i> case the deed was of <i>all</i> the property; was <i>secret;</i> was of <i>chattels,</i> and purported to be <i>absolute,</i> yet the vendor remained in possession of them, and exercised marks of ownership over them. In <i>this</i> case the deed is of <i>part</i> of the property, is of <i>record,</i> is of <i>lands,</i> and purports to be a conveyance which, according to its legal operation, leaves the property conveyed in possession of the grantor. In the case of <i>Hamilton</i> v. <i>Russel,</i> this court declared an absolute bill of sale of a personal chattel, of which the vendor retained the possession, to be a fraud. But the difference is a marked one, between a conveyance which purports to be absolute, and a conveyance which, from its terms, is to leave the possession in the vendor. If, in the latter case, the retaining of possession was evidence of fraud, no mortgage could be valid. The possession universally remains with the grantor, until the creditor becomes entitled to his money, and either chuses, or is compelled to exert his right. That the grantor is to receive the rents and profits, till the grantee shall become entitled to demand the money which the deed is intended to secure, is a usual covenant.</p>\n<p>That the property stood bound for future advances, is, in itself, unexceptionable. It may, indeed, be converted to improper purposes, but it is not positively inadmissible. It is frequent for a person who expects to become more considerably indebted, to mortgage property to his creditor, as a security for debts to be contracted, as well as for that which is already due. All the covenants in this deed appear to the court to be fair, legitimate, and consistent with common usage. It will barely be observed, that the validity of this conveyance is to be tested by the statutes of Virginia, which embrace this subject. But this is not mentioned as having any influence in this case.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*90</span> The second point for which the plaintiffs contend is, that this is a case in which the priority of payment claimed by the United States in cases of insolvency, intervenes and avoids the deed.</p>\n<p>This claim is opposed on two grounds. It is contended,</p>\n<p>1st. That at the time of making this deed, Fitzgerald was not insolvent in point of fact; and,</p>\n<p>2d. That this deed was not a transaction which evidences insolvency under the act of congress.</p>\n<p>In construing the statutes on this subject, it has been stated by the court, on great deliberation, that the priority to which the United States are entitled, does not partake of the character of a <i>lien</i> on the property of public debtors. This distinction is always to be recollected.</p>\n<p>In the case at bar, it will be observed, on the first objection made by the defendants, that the insolvency, which is the foundation of the claim, must certainly be proved by the United States. It must appear that at the time of making the conveyance, Fitzgerald was \"a debtor not having sufficient property to pay all his debts.\" The abstract from the books of the treasury, is undoubtedly complete evidence as far as it goes; but it is not intended to show the state of Fitzgerald's accounts in January, 1799. If that had been its object, it would have credited him for the bonds then reported to be on hand. If the case turned entirely on this point, the court would probably send it back for further explanation respecting it. But this would be unnecessary, as it is the opinion of the court that the decree is right, however this fact may stand.</p>\n<p>If a debtor of the United States, who makes a <i>bona fide</i> conveyance of part of his property for the security of a creditor, is within the act which gives a preference to the government, then would that preference be in the nature of a <i>lien</i> from the instant he became indebted; the inconvenience of which, where the debtor continued to transact business with the world, would certainly be very great.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*91</span> The words of the act extend the meaning of the word <i>insolvency,</i> to cases where \"a debtor, not having <i>sufficient property to pay all his debts,</i> shall have made a voluntary assignment <i>thereof,</i> for the benefit of his or her creditors.\" The word <i>\"property\"</i> is unquestionably all the property which the debtor possesses; and the word <i>\"thereof\"</i> refers to the word <i>\"property\"</i> as used, and can only be satisfied by an assignment of all the property of the debtor. Had the legislature contemplated a partial assignment, the words <i>\"or part thereof,\"</i> or others of similar import, would have been added.</p>\n<p>If a trivial portion of an estate should be left out, for the purpose of evading the act, it would be considered as a fraud upon the law, and the parties would not be enabled to avail themselves of such a contrivance. But where a <i>bona fide</i> conveyance of part is made, not to avoid the law, but to secure a fair creditor, the case is not within the letter or the intention of the act.</p>\n<p>It is observable, that the term <i>insolvency</i> was originally used, and the subsequent sentence is designed to explain the meaning and intent of the term.

Hooe, W. Herbert, Fohn C. Herbert</i>, and the <i>executors, widow and heirs of Col. Fohn Fitzgerald</i>, late collector of the customs for the port of Alexandria, and obtained an injunction to prevent the sale of certain real estate in Alexandria, advertised for sale by W. and J. C. Herbert, under a deed of trust made by Fitzgerald for the indemnification of Hooe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The material facts appearing upon the record are, that Fitzgerald, upon being appointed collector, executed a bond to the United States, on the 10th of April, 1794, with Hooe as surety, in the penalty of 10,000 dollars, for the faithful performance of the duties of his office. In April, 1798, he was found to be greatly in arrears, and upon a final adjustment of his accounts, on the 15th of August, 1799, the balance against him was 57,157 dollars. On the 16th of January, 1799, Hooe having knowledge that Fitzgerald was largely indebted to the United States, but believing that he had sufficient property to discharge the debt, and Fitzgerald being desirous of borrowing money from the bank of Alexandria to meet the drafts of the treasury of the United States, and for other purposes, made a deed of trust to W. and J. C. Herbert, reciting that Hooe had become surety for Fitzgerald, in the bond to the United States, and Fitzgerald proposing, when he should wish to obtain a loan of money from the bank of Alexandria, to draw notes to be indorsed by Hooe, whereby the latter might be liable and compelled to pay the same, and the former being desirous of securing and indemnifying Hooe from all damages, costs and charges which he might at any time thereafter be subject and liable to by reason of any misconduct of Fitzgerald in the discharge of his duty as collector, or for or on account of any notes drawn by him for his particular use and accommodation, and indorsed by Hooe, and negotiated at the bank of Alexandria. The indenture then witnessed, that for those purposes, and in consideration of the trusts and confidences therein after expressed, &amp;c. and of one dollar, &amp;c. Fitzgerald bargained and sold, &amp;c. to the trustees, W. and J. C. Herbert, the real estate therein described, to have and to hold the same to them and the survivor of them, &amp;c. '<i>in trust</i>, to and for the uses and purposes herein after mentioned, and to and for no other use and purpose whatsoever; that is to say, in case he the said John Fitzgerald shall neglect any part of his duty as collector of the said port of Alexandria,' &amp;c. 'or in case any note or notes so drawn, indorsed and negotiated at the bank of Alexandria, for the particular use and accommodation of him, the said John Fitzgerald, shall not be taken up and discharged by him when the same shall become payable; that in either case, as soon as any demand shall be made upon him, the said R. T. Hooe,' &amp;c. 'for the payment of any sum or sums of money which ought to be paid by the said John Fitzgerald,' &amp;c. then the trustees should, upon notice given them by Hooe, of such demand, proceed to sell the property for ready money, and after paying the expenses of sale, should pay and satisfy the sum or sums of money so demanded of Hooe, either as security for Fitzgerald's due and faithful execution of the office of collector of the said port of Alexandria, or as indorsor of any note or notes so drawn by Fitzgerald, 'and negotiated at the bank of Alexandria for the particular accommodation of the said John Fitzgerald;' and lastly, to pay over to him the surplus. And in further trust that if Fitzgerald should duly keep Hooe indemnified, &amp;c. and should duly pay the several notes which should be so drawn by him and indorsed by Hooe, and negotiated at the said bank, 'for the particular accommodation of him, the said John Fitzgerald, as the same shall become payable,' then the trustees should reconvey, &amp;c.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hooe had indorsed Fitzgerald's notes at the bank to a large amount, and at the time of his death there were unpaid two notes of 1000 dollars each, and one of 1800 dollars, one of which for 1000 dollars, together with interest upon the whole, amounting to 288 dollars and 94 cents, was afterwards paid by Mr. Keith, one of the executors, in order to prevent a sale of the property under the trust. There was also evidence tending to show that the money borrowed from the bank upon Hooe's indorsement, was applied in discharge of warrants drawn by the treasury upon Fitzgerald.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fitzgerald died in December, 1799, having by his will directed his real estate to be sold for the payment of his debts.

Herbert and John C. Herbert, from selling the property in the deed of trust, in the bill mentioned, be discharged; and it was further <i>decreed and ordered</i>, that the said trustees should pay the proceeds arising from the sale of the said property, or of any part thereof, into this court, subject to the future order of the court, touching the contending claims of the United States, and of R. T. Hooe, one of the defendants to the said bill; <i>and now, at November term</i>, 1802, the said cause came on by consent of parties, and by order of the court, on the bill, and on the answers of the defendants, (those of the infants being taken by their guardians, appointed for that purpose) and on the exhibits in the said bill and answers referred to, and on those afterwards admitted, and the arguments of counsel being heard in the said cause, and the same being by the court fully considered; <i>it is the opinion of the court</i>, that the deed of trust, in the said bill mentioned, was made <i>bona fide</i>, and for a valuable consideration, and was fairly executed by the said John Fitzgerald, to indemnify, and save harmless, the said R. T. Hooe, from all loss and damage, by reason of his indorsement of several notes, negotiated at the bank of Alexandria, amounting to the sum of 3,800 dollars, to enable the said John Fitzgerald to pay that sum to the United States; which appears to have been paid accordingly; and also, to indemnify and save harmless, the said R. T. Hooe, against all loss and damage, by reason of his having become bound in a bond, in the penalty of 10,000 dollars, payable to the United States, as security for the said John Fitzgerald's faithful performance and due discharge of the office of collector of the customs, in the district of Alexandria.

That the deed was fraudulent, as to all the world, because it empowered Fitzgerald to borrow money upon it for his own use, while it protected the property from his creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. That Hooe has no preference to the United States; and even if the deed was not fraudulent, as to all the world, yet Hooe stands in such a situation, that he must be postponed to the United States and all other creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Hooe admits, that he had notice of Fitzgerald's default, to at least the amount of 30,000 dollars, but the exact amount is unimportant. And although, in his answer, he gives an opinion as to the value of Fitzgerald's estate, at the date of the deed, yet he admits, that such as it then was, it now is, excepting any depreciation which it may have suffered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deed, inasmuch as it contains a power to raise money upon it, in future, for his own use, is a deed in trust for himself, and therefore fraudulent upon general principles of law. His power to borrow money upon it, is unlimited by any thing but the value of the property and the good will of Hooe; and the money thus raised upon it might have been applied exclusively to his own use.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The words of the statute of 13 <i>Eliz. c. 5</i>, which have, in substance, been inserted into the Virginia code of laws, are large enough to take in this case; and the cases decided under it clearly apply to the present deed. Indeed, that part of the statute which makes such deeds void as to creditors, is no more than a declaration of the pre-existing rule of the common law. 2 <i>Bac. Ab. Tit. Fraud</i>. 2 <i>Com. Dig. Tit. Covin</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 5th sign of fraud mentioned in <i>Twyne's case</i>, 3 <i>Co.</i> 81. (<i>b</i>) is, that there 'was a trust between the parties; for the donor possessed all, and used them as his proper goods, and fraud is always apparelled and clad with a trust, and a trust is the cover of fraud.' And it is unimportant whether the trust be expressed or implied. Every gift made on a trust is out of the proviso of the act. Here it was part of the trust that Fitzgerald should raise money upon the deed to his own use; and a deed which covers the property from his creditors, and gives the grantor the whole benefit and use of it, is the very kind of deed which the statute meant to avoid. If, then, the deed is void as to creditors, Fitzgerald is dead, and the United States must be preferred in payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Hooe cannot be preferred to the United States, in consequence of this deed, even supposing it not to be fraudulent under the statute of <i>Elizabeth</i>, but must be postponed to the United States, and all other creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case stands on the same ground as a bond given for duties, in which case it is enacted by the <i>act of</i> 4th <i>of August</i>, 1790, <i>c.</i> 35, &#167; 45, <i>vol.</i> 1, <i>p.</i> 221, that 'in all cases of insolvency, or where any estate in the hands of executors or administrators shall be insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased, the debt due to the United States, on any such bond, shall be first satisfied.' The insolvency here mentioned, means an inability to pay all his debts, and is so expounded by the act of 2d <i>of May</i>, 1792, <i>c.</i> 27, &#167; 18, <i>vol.</i> 2, <i>p.</i> 79, in which it is 'declared that the cases of insolvency in the said 44th' (45th) 'section mentioned, shall be deemed to extend as well to cases in which a debtor, <i>not having sufficient property to pay all his or her debts</i>, shall have made a voluntary assignment thereof, for the benefit of his or her creditors, or in which the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed, or absent debtor, shall have been attached by process of law, as to cases in which an act of legal bankruptcy shall have been committed.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A voluntary assignment, for the benefit of his creditors, made by a debtor, unable to pay all his debts, is one of the cases in which the United States are to have a preference. The word 'voluntary' does not mean <i>without consideration</i>, but without compulsion of law, as in cases under a bankrupt law. A deed made to secure a just debt may, in this sense of the word, be a voluntary deed of assignment. The instant a man makes such a voluntary assignment, the preference of the United States attaches, if, upon subsequent inquiry, it shall appear that he is unable to pay all his debts. The act of 2d <i>of March</i>, 1799, <i>c.</i> 128, &#167; 65, <i>vol.</i> 4, <i>p.</i> 387, has the same words, explanatory of the term <i>insolvency</i>, with those of the 18th &#167; <i>of the act</i>, 1792, <i>vol.</i> 2, <i>p.</i> 79. The legislature did not mean to confine it to cases of insolvency, under a bankrupt or insolvent law of any of the states, or of the United States, nor to voluntary conveyances of <i>all</i> the property of a debtor, for the benefit of his creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, all the property remains in the same state in which it was at the time of the deed, and it is not contended that it is sufficient to pay all the debts; for if it is, Hooe can receive no injury; but if it is insufficient, then he can derive no benefit, until the United States are first satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not contend that the United States had a <i>lien</i> upon the property. That is a distinct question, and has been decided by this court, at the present term, in the case of <i>United States</i> v. <i>Fisher, et al.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But it is right that the interest of all should prevail over that of an individual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We admit that Fitzgerald had the right to sell and alien the property, but it does not follow that he could, by a mortgage, or an assignment, prefer a <i>particular</i> creditor to the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The object of the legislature was, that if a man is unable to pay all his debts, and attempts to give a particular preference, his hand shall be stopped, until the debt due to the United States shall be satisfied. If it turns out that he was actually insolvent, the United States, and not the individual creditor, shall have the preference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The object of the deed is, that if Fitzgerald's estate should be insufficient to pay all his debts, Hooe shall be preferred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the act of congress says that, in that event, the United States shall be preferred. The deed and the act are inconsistent with each other, and the deed must yield to the act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among individual creditors, he had a right to prefer one over another, and such deeds would have been effectual, saving the priority of the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This question is the same as if it had arisen upon a bond given for duties; for by the <i>act of</i> 3d <i>of March</i>, 1797, <i>c.</i> 74, &#167; <i>5, vol.</i> 3, <i>p.</i> 421, it is enacted, 'that where any revenue-officer, <i>or other person</i>, hereafter becoming indebted to the United States, by bond <i>or otherwise</i>, shall become insolvent,' &amp; c. 'the debt due to the United States shall be first satisfied; and the priority hereby established, shall be deemed to extend as well to cases in which a debtor, not having sufficient property to pay all his debts, shall make a voluntary assignment thereof,' &amp;c. 'as to cases in which an act of legal bankruptcy shall be committed.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a voluntary assignment, and Fitzgerald died insolvent. It is not necessary that he should have been so at the time of executing the deed. If he become so afterwards, and before the trust is executed, it is sufficient. It is the intention of the law, if there is an actual insolvency, that all priorities should yield to that of the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States, therefore, has a right to the whole of Fitzgerald's estate, in the first place; and if that is insufficient to pay the debt, they may resort to Hooe, for the whole penalty of the bond, if necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>C.

That the deed was made <i>bona fide</i>, and for a valuable and good consideration, and therefore valid upon general principles, both of law and equity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2d. That it was not invalidated by any statute of the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Indemnity</i> is a good consideration, within the statute of <i>Elizabeth</i>, 1 <i>Burr.</i> 474, <i>Worseley</i> v. <i>Demattos</i>, to the whole of which case the attention of the court is requested, because, in almost every part, it is applicable to the present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deed was also <i>bona fide</i>. There is no evidence that Hooe knew of Fitzgerald's inability to pay his debts at the date of the deed. Indeed, there is no positive evidence of the insolvency of the estate, even at this moment. It has none of the marks of fraud mentioned in Twyne's case. <i>First;</i> it is only for a <i>part</i>, perhaps not a third part of his estate. <i>Secondly</i>, although Fitzgerald remained in possession, yet, it being real estate, possession was no mark of fraud, and could not deceive and defraud others, because the deed must of necessity be upon record. <i>Thirdly;</i> it was not made secretly. <i>Fourthly;</i> it was not made pending any process against Fitzgerald. <i>Fifthly;</i> here was no secret trust for the benefit of the grantor&#8212;and, <i>Sixthly;</i> it contains no unusual clauses in support of its honest and fair intentions, which, Lord Coke says, always induce suspicion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The whole evidence in the case shows, that the only intention of the parties was that which is expressed fully and fairly in the deed. He had a right to indemnify Hooe at the time of giving the bond, and it can make no difference whether he executed the deed at that time or afterwards; the consideration was equally good at one time as at the other. It could be no fraud in Hooe to wait for security as long as he thought himself safe; and it could be no fraud in Fitzgerald to give a security, which he was bound in honour and conscience to give, whenever it should be demanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mason</i>, in answer to a question from the Chief Justice, whether there was any act of Congress which subjected the lands of the debtors of the United States to a specific lien, said, he knew of none, unless it was the act of 11<i>th July</i>, 1798, <i>c.</i> 88, &#167; 15, <i>vol.</i> 4, <i>p.</i> 197. But in the present case, Fitzgerald, by his will, charged his lands with the payment of his debts; and if he had not, they would have been liable to an <i>elegit</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Chief Justice</i>. I have considered the act of 1798; it only creates a <i>lien</i> when a suit is commenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\"><i>Monday, February 25</i>.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MARSHALL, Ch.

They can only sell to <i>indemnify</i> Hooe. Until he is damnified they have no power to sell. The rents, issues, and profits, are to be taken by Fitzgerald only; and the legal estate being in the trustees, the property is protected from the <i>elegit</i> of the creditors. Suppose the property conveyed to be double the value of Hooe's claim, the residue would be protected from creditors, and would still be a fund from which Fitzgerald might draw supplies to himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the <i>insolvency</i>, mentioned in the act of congress, means an inability to pay his debts, in contradistinction to an insolvency under a bankrupt law, or an insolvent act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A <i>voluntary deed</i>, in the act, means a deed by a person unable to pay all his debts, made without coercion of law, to give a preference to some of his creditors. It is not necessary that it should be a conveyance of <i>all his effects</i>. Suppose he should make three separate deeds; one to one of his creditors for one third of his estate; a second to another creditor for another third of his estate, and a third deed to a third creditor for the residue. The two first deeds would not be less fraudulent than the third, because they conveyed only a part of the estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decree of the court below is erroneous, because the answers and evidence specified the estate and effects of Fitzgerald, and the court ought to have ascertained the value, and from thence inferred his insolvency. An insolvency so ascertained, would have been such an insolvency as would have given the United States a preference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the question, whether the insolvency appears upon the record&#8212;the bill charges the fact, and none of the answers or depositions denies it. A comparison of the balance due, with the effects and estate disclosed in the answers, affords the strongest corroboration; and even Hooe, in his answer, does not deny a knowledge of it. But whether he knew it or not, it is sufficient if we establish the existence of the fact; for in all cases 'where any revenue officer,' 'indebted to the United States,' 'shall become insolvent,' 'the debt due to the United States shall be first paid.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>C.

If the debtor 'shall become <i>insolvent</i>.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

If it meant every case where a man was actually incapable of paying all his debts, it would frequently look back and undo all the negotiations of an extensive trade for many years; for it often happens that a merchant continues in business and credit long after his capacity to pay all his debts has ceased. Besides, it would have been unnecessary for the legislature to add expressly the case of a voluntary assignment, where there was an inability to pay all the debts, if such inability alone was within the meaning of the words 'shall become <i>insolvent</i>.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The case of a deceased debtor, whose estate shall be insufficient to pay all the debts, would also have been included in the term <i>insolvent</i>, if it is to have so large and loose a construction as is contended for by the counsel for the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. And so would be the case of a voluntary assignment. But it is said that the present deed is such a voluntary assignment as is contemplated in the act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The words of the act are, 'a debtor, not having sufficient property to pay all his debts,' that is to say, the <i>whole</i> of whose property shall be insufficient to pay all his debts, 'shall make a voluntary assignment <i>thereof</i>,' that is, of the <i>whole</i> of his property. The assignment contemplated in the law must, therefore, mean an assignment of the <i>whole;</i> but this is only an assignment of a part, certainly not so much as <i>half</i> of his property, and is, therefore, a complete answer as to that point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. The fourth case is of an attachment of the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed, or absent debtor, and does not absolutely require an insolvency, or even an inability to pay all the debts; but is a case of suspicion, in which a public act has been done and suffered, giving notice of the insolvency, if it really exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even supposing, then, that Fitzgerald was actually unable to pay all his debts at the time of executing this deed of trust, (which fact, however, does not appear) yet, as his property was not divested by act of law, nor by such a voluntary assignment as is contemplated by the act of congress, the priority of the United States had not attached, so as by any possibility to avoid the deed of trust.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This construction of the act of congress is warranted by the decision of a very respectable circuit court of the United States, in the case of <i>United States</i> v. <i>King, Wallace's Reports, p.</i> 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States are plaintiffs in equity for an injunction, and the burden is on them to prove all the material allegations of their bill. It is on them to prove the insolvency, not on us to disprove it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, then, the deed is not fraudulent in itself, nor made void by any act of congress, the judgment of the court below was correct, and ought to be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\"><i>Wednesday, February</i> 27.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first point made in this case, by the attorney for the United States, is, that the deed of the 16th of January, 1799, is fraudulent as to creditors generally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not alleged that the consideration was feigned, or that there was any secret trust between the parties. The transaction is admitted to have been, in truth, what it purports to be; but it is contended that the deed, on its face, is fraudulent as to creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deed is made to save Hooe harmless on account of his having become the security of Fitzgerald to the United States, and on account of of notes to be indorsed by Hooe for the accommodation of Fitzgerald, in the bank of Alexandria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These are purposes for which it is supposed this deed of trust could not lawfully have been executed; and the deed has been pronounced fraudulent under the statute of 13<i>th of Elizabeth</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That statute contains a proviso, that it shall not extend to conveyances made upon <i>good consideration</i>, and bona fide. The goodness of the consideration, in the case at bar, has been admitted; but it is alleged that the conveyance is not <i>bona fide;</i> and for this, <i>Twyne's</i> case has been principally relied on. But in that case, the intent was believed by the court to be fraudulent, and in this case it is admitted not to have been fraudulent. It is contended, that all the circumstances from which fraud was inferred in that case, are to be found in this; but the court can find between them no trait of similitude. In <i>that</i> case the deed was of <i>all</i> the property; was <i>secret;</i> was of <i>chattels</i>, and purported to be <i>absolute</i>, yet the vendor remained in possession of them, and exercised marks of ownership over them. In <i>this</i> case the deed is of <i>part</i> of the property, is of <i>record</i>, is of <i>lands</i>, and purports to be a conveyance which, according to its legal operation, leaves the property conveyed in possession of the grantor. In the case of <i>Hamilton</i> v. <i>Russel</i>, this court declared an absolute bill of sale of a personal chattel, of which the vendor retained the possession, to be a fraud. But the difference is a marked one, between a conveyance which purports to be absolute, and a conveyance which, from its terms, is to leave the possession in the vendor. If, in the latter case, the retaining of possession was evidence of fraud, no mortgage could be valid. The possession universally remains with the grantor, until the creditor becomes entitled to his money, and either chuses, or is compelled to exert his right. That the grantor is to receive the rents and profits, till the grantee shall become entitled to demand the money which the deed is intended to secure, is a usual covenant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the property stood bound for future advances, is, in itself, unexceptionable. It may, indeed, be converted to improper purposes, but it is not positively inadmissible. It is frequent for a person who expects to become more considerably indebted, to mortgage property to his creditor, as a security for debts to be contracted, as well as for that which is already due. All the covenants in this deed appear to the court to be fair, legitimate, and consistent with common usage. It will barely be observed, that the validity of this conveyance is to be tested by the statutes of Virginia, which embrace this subject. But this is not mentioned as having any influence in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second point for which the plaintiffs contend is, that this is a case in which the priority of payment claimed by the United States in cases of insolvency, intervenes and avoids the deed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This claim is opposed on two grounds. It is contended,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1st. That at the time of making this deed, Fitzgerald was not insolvent in point of fact; and,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2d. That this deed was not a transaction which evidences insolvency under the act of congress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In construing the statutes on this subject, it has been stated by the court, on great deliberation, that the priority to which the United States are entitled, does not partake of the character of a <i>lien</i> on the property of public debtors. This distinction is always to be recollected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at bar, it will be observed, on the first objection made by the defendants, that the insolvency, which is the foundation of the claim, must certainly be proved by the United States. It must appear that at the time of making the conveyance, Fitzgerald was 'a debtor not having sufficient property to pay all his debts.' The abstract from the books of the treasury, is undoubtedly complete evidence as far as it goes; but it is not intended to show the state of Fitzgerald's accounts in January, 1799. If that had been its object, it would have credited him for the bonds then reported to be on hand. If the case turned entirely on this point, the court would probably send it back for further explanation respecting it. But this would be unnecessary, as it is the opinion of the court that the decree is right, however this fact may stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a debtor of the United States, who makes a <i>bona fide</i> conveyance of part of his property for the security of a creditor, is within the act which gives a preference to the government, then would that preference be in the nature of a <i>lien</i> from the instant he became indebted; the inconvenience of which, where the debtor continued to transact business with the world, would certainly be very great.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The words of the act extend the meaning of the word <i>insolvency</i>, to cases where 'a debtor, not having <i>sufficient property to pay all his debts</i>, shall have made a voluntary assignment <i>thereof</i>, for the benefit of his or her creditors.' The word '<i>property</i>' is unquestionably all the property which the debtor possesses; and the word '<i>thereof</i>' refers to the word '<i>property</i>' as used, and can only be satisfied by an assignment of all the property of the debtor. Had the legislature contemplated a partial assignment, the words '<i>or part thereof</i>,' or others of similar import, would have been added.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a trivial portion of an estate should be left out, for the purpose of evading the act, it would be considered as a fraud upon the law, and the parties would not be enabled to avail themselves of such a contrivance. But where a <i>bona fide</i> conveyance of part is made, not to avoid the law, but to secure a fair creditor, the case is not within the letter or the intention of the act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is observable, that the term <i>insolvency</i> was originally used, and the subsequent sentence is designed to explain the meaning and intent of the term. The whole explanation relates to such a general divestment of property, as would, in fact, be equivalent to insolvency in its technical sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is the opinion of the court, that there is no error in the decree of the circuit court, and that it be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the opinion was given, it was stated, that the court below had decreed the United States to pay costs, and it was suggested that that circumstance might have escaped the notice of this court, in affirming the decree generally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mason</i> observed, that costs were only given by statute, and that the United States are not bound by a statute, unless they are expressly named in it. That there was no means of compelling the United States to pay them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MARSHALL, Ch. J. That would make no difference, because we are to presume they would pay them if bound by law so to do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mason</i>. There is no precedent of a judgment against the United States for costs. In the case of the <i>United States</i> v. <i>La Vengeance</i>, 3 <i>Dal.</i> 301, the decree of the circuit court was affirmed <i>with costs</i>. But the next day the Chief Justice directed the words 'with costs' to be struck out, as there appeared to have been some cause for the prosecution. But he observed, in doing this, the court did not mean to be understood as at all deciding the question, whether, in any case, they could award costs against the United States, but left it entirely open for future discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\"><i>March 6th</i>.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court directed the decree of the court below to be affirmed, except as to costs, and reversed so much of the decree as awarded the United States to pay costs, and directed that no costs be allowed to either party in this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Present, <i>Marshall</i>, Chief Justice.&#8212;<i>Cushing, Paterson, Washington</i> and <i>Johnson</i>, Justices.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\n        <p> <i>See Ante, vol.</i> 1, <i>p.</i> 318.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
