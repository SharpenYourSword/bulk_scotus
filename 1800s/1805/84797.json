In the case of <i>Scott</i> v. <i>Hornsby</i>, 1 <i>Call</i>, 41, the court of appeals of Virginia, decided, that if a forthcoming bond be taken for more than the sum due by the execution, and the plaintiff release the excess, the bond will support a judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Jones</i>, in reply. The awarding of execution on a forthcoming bond, upon motion, is a summary remedy given by statue, in derogation of the common law, and, therefore, the provisions of the statute must be strictly pursued. The release cannot aid an error in the exercise of this summary jurisdiction. I admit the practice to be, that if the bond be for more than the judgment, and the plaintiff releases the excess, it will support a judgment. So if the bond be for too small a sum, it is still good as a bond at common law.
