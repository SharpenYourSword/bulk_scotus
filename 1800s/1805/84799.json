That the defendant received the freight of the cargo, carried from New-Orleans, at Jamaica.

That being so indebted, R. Hamilton, on the 13th of May, 1800, gave the said Haynes an order on his brother James, then in New-Orleans, stating a balance of 384 dollars, to be due to him, with some interest, and requesting his brother to pay it. That on the same day, they were indebted to the defendant, in the sum of 800 dollars, for wages due him, as master of, and disbursements on account of the schooner, <i>on a previous</i> voyage, which sum R. Hamilton requested his brother James, at New-Orleans, to pay, by letter of that date. That the defendant received his sailing-orders and instructions from R. Hamilton, in the name of R. and J. Hamilton, on the 14th of May, 1800, before he sailed from Alexandria. That the vessel was conducted entirely under the directions of R. and J. Hamilton, from the date of the mortgage, on the 4th of May, 1800, until the 27th of November, 1800, when she was delivered to the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That on the voyage from Alexandria to New-Orleans, the defendant met James Hamilton, in the river Mississippi, and showed him the orders in favour of the defendant and of John Haynes, and requested payment. That James Hamilton replied, that he had no money to satisfy the said orders; that the defendant must wait <i>until the vessel earned enough</i> to pay them, and desired the defendant to pay them out of the first money the vessel should earn, by freight or otherwise. That the vessel proceeded to New-Orleans, and from thence with a cargo to Jamaica, where the freight was received, and out of the same the defendant paid Haynes the 384 dollars, and applied 800 dollars to the discharge of his own claim. That the vessel then sailed from Jamaica, and arrived at Alexandria on the 27th of November, 1800. That after her arrival, and after possession delivered to the plaintiff, the latter paid the expenses and disbursements of the voyage, which became due on her arrival, by the orders of the defendant. The plaintiff also insured the vessel for the said voyage, and paid the premium thereon, after her departure for New-Orleans. It was also proved, that on the defendant's return to Alexandria with the vessel, and before the plaintiff took possession of her, and received his absolute bill of sale, as aforesaid, the defendant rendered to, and settled with R. and J. Hamilton, an account current of the expenses and profits on the said voyage, in which they gave credit for the order in favour of himself, and that in favour of Haynes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon this statement of the evidence, the plaintiff prayed the court to instruct the jury, that he was entitled to recover of the defendant, the sum of 1184 dollars, thus admitted to have been received for freight, and applied to the discharge of the two orders; which the court refused to do, and directed the jury to find a verdict for the defendant, if they found the facts to be as stated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 2d bill of exceptions stated, that the plaintiff prayed the court to instruct the jury, that if they should be of opinion, from the evidence aforesaid, that the defendant received information of the mortgage from Robert Hamilton, before the schooner sailed upon the said voyage, the plaintiff was entitled to recover the said 1184 dollars, which the court also refused to do, and directed the jury, as before, that their verdict ought to be for the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case was first argued at February term, 1804.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\"><i>February</i> 27, 1804.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>E.

Possession, upon common law principles, is not necessary in order to give title in the transference of property. It is true, that possession in the vendor, after the transfer, is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of fraud, and this is the only effect of such possession; but as to the proof of fraud, it is not conclusive. It may be rebutted by testimony showing the transaction <i>bona fide</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only use in delivering possession, is to prevent strangers being deceived by a false credit, which the possession in the vendor is calculated to produce. This reason cannot be applicable in this case to <i>Butts</i>. 1. Because Butts knew of the mortgage. 2. Because the debt due to him from the Hamiltons was an antecedent debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the Hamiltons had been declared bankrupts, their assignees could not have claimed the vessel or the freight; because both were pledged as a security to Hodgson.

But the act of the legislature of Virginia, places the question beyond a doubt, and proves that possession is not necessary to constitute the ownership. <i>See Virginia laws</i>, 157, <i>revised code of</i> 1802. 1 <i>Washington</i>, 177.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legal owner of the vessel is entitled to receive the freight, <i>Marshall on Insurance</i>, 93.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mortgagee of a vessel in a late case has been considered as the owner, and as such, liable for repairs done to her before he received actual possession. 7 <i>Term Rep.</i> 306. In this case the decision in <i>Chinnery</i> v. <i>Blackburne</i>, 1 <i>H. Black.

Black.</i> 114, and <i>Chinnery</i> v. <i>Blackburne</i>, which will be relied on by the defendant, will, upon examination, be found not to meet the question which arises in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of <i>Jackson</i> v. <i>Vernon</i>, the question was, whether the mortgagee was liable for the repairs to the ship; it was decided he was not, because, the mortgagor himself ordered the repairs; as the person who makes repairs on a ship, has a claim on the person ordering them, it was supposed the credit was given to him, and upon this ground it was held the mortgagee was not liable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of <i>Chinnery</i> v. <i>Blackburne</i>, Merryfield, acted as the owner; he navigated the vessel, and made all contracts about her, from London to Antigua. He was on board of her on the voyage, and at Antigua gave the command of the vessel to another captain; he also insured the vessel; and at Antigua, acted personally in command of the ship. This is not like the case at bar; for in this, Hamilton did not furnish the vessel, or man her after the mortgage, nor did he insure her; but Hodgson did the last act. But both cases are doubted in the case 7 <i>Term</i>, 306, and <i>by Abbott</i>, 16, who says, they do not furnish a case for the decision of the question, who is entitled to the freight, which a case of a contract made by the master in that character, will; which is our case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a distinction in a court of equity and a court of law, where the mortgagor acts as the master of the vessel. In the court of equity, he is considered as owner; but not so in a court of law. <i>Marsh.</i> 452, 453. Hamilton never acted as master.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4th. The contract in words, binds and includes the freight. To which it is objected, that future freight is too remote an interest, to be transferred; freight, or a hope, or expectation, is such an interest as may be insured; and, if insurable, it may be granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goods, as well as their expected produce, may be granted, <i>Prec.

It is not competent for Butts, who claims under Hamilton, to object that the freight it not included or passed by the deed. <i>Cowp.</i> 600.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5th. The objection, that Robert Hamilton exercised authority over the vessel, by giving instructions, is not of any weight, in the mouth of Butts; because Butts had a full knowledge of the <i>lien</i> of Hodgson, and also, because it does not appear that Hodgson authorised this interference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The directions of James Hamilton, that Butts was to wait until the vessel earned enough to pay him, is also without weight; because James Hamilton was ignorant of the arrangement which his partner had made; and of which Butts might have informed him; but not having done so, he is the more culpable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6th. Hamilton had no right to appropriate the freight to any other person, than that specified in his deed of mortgage. If <i>he</i> had not, Butts, his servant, had not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Butts must be considered, either as the servant of Hamilton, or of Hodgson, if the servant of the former, and undertakes to act as such, he had no right to apply the money in the manner he did. If he undertook the command as Hodgson's servant, he had no right to apply the freight to the payment of a debt due from Hamilton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7th. Butts having accepted of the command of the vessel, with a full knowledge of the <i>lien</i> upon her, and her future freight, he tacitly consented to apply the freight according to the agreement between Hamilton and Hodgson; if he intended otherwise at the time, he has been guilty of a fraud, which ought not to avail him in a court of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8th. The captain had no <i>lien</i> for his 800 dollars, due for his own wages on the vessel. The mate had no <i>lien</i> on this vessel, for 200 dollars, they being earned on board of a different vessel, and in a different voyage. The balance of the mate's wages, was only 184 dollars. The mate, by accepting an order on James Hamilton, for 384 dollars, the whole of the wages due him, agreed to accept payment in a different way from the usual one; which destroys the <i>lien</i> on the vessel, for the 184 dollars. <i>Salk.</i> 131.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides, for this 184 dollars, Butts, as the captain of the vessel when it was earned, was liable; and the moment he paid that sum, the mate's <i>lien</i> was gone. The captain has no <i>lien</i> on the vessel for the wages he pays the seamen, but has on the freight, for the wages of the voyage in which the freight was earned. The mate, by assigning the bill on James Hamilton, could not assign any <i>lien</i> he had on the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">9th.

The words of the act are, 'all deeds of trust and mortgages whatsoever shall be void as to all creditors and subsequent purchasers, <i>unless</i> they shall be acknowledged or proved, and recorded according to the directions of this act.'

As to the effect of the deed, if valid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff, by the terms of the deed itself, could not meddle with the schooner, until days after her return from her then intended voyage to New-Orleans, and a failure on the part of the mortgagors to indemnify him; and his only authority then would be to sell the vessel and cargo, if not previously sold by the mortgagors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, then, the defendant did know of the mortgage, he must be presumed to know the whole terms; and that the plaintiff could not interfere till long after his return. He also knew, that before a forfeiture of the mortgage, and while the mortgagor holds the possession, the latter is to be considered the owner. 1 <i>H. B.</i> 114, <i>Fackson</i> v. <i>Vernon</i>, and 1 <i>H. B.</i> 117, <i>Chinnery</i> v. <i>Blackburne</i>. Even in the case of lands, a mortgagor has been held to be a freeholder, and entitled to vote at elections. And the mortgagee of a leasehold estate, cannot be sued by the lessor as <i>assignee</i> of the lessee, until the mortgagee is in possession, although the mortgage be forfeited, and he has a right of possession. <i>Doug.</i> 155, <i>Eaton</i> v. <i>Facques. Doug.</i> 22, <i>Keech</i> v. <i>Hall</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mortgagors had a right to receive the freight, and if so, they had a right to appropriate it. The freight is not like rent, which is said to grow out of the land. It depends upon a mere personal contract. If they had received the freight, their receipt would have been good against the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the payment of the expenses of the voyage by the plaintiff, it was voluntary. He had his reasons. He made a new contract, and paid the money after he had possession under his absolute purchase of the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The extrajudicial doubts of Lord Kenyon and Abbott, cannot controul the strong and decisive cases of <i>Fackson</i> v. <i>Vernon</i>, and <i>Chinnery</i> v. <i>Blackburne</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the covenant respecting the freight, it is merely a personal contract, and the plaintiff trusted to the personal security of the mortgagors. Even if they had sold the inward cargo, the plaintiff could not recover against the vendees. But the freight was not even a <i>chose in action</i>. It was only a possibility. It was not in being, and, therefore, not capable of a legal assignment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Swann</i>, in reply. The vessel was of less value when she returned than when she was mortgaged, by at least the difference of the freight. Hodgson paid the expenses of the voyage. It is equitable, therefore, that he should receive the freight. The defendant had no <i>lien</i> on the vessel or freight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two questions seem to arise in this cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. What relation does the mortgagor stand in to the mortgagee?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. What relation does the defendant stand in to both?1. By the English law, possession must accompany the deed, except as to vessels at sea. But here possession is not necessary, if the deed be proved and recorded in a certain manner. It is then as valid, to all intents and purposes, as if possession had been delivered with the deed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The court</i> said, he need not argue that point. It had been settled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Swann</i>. What then are the rights which it conveys? As to mortgages of lands, the law is settled; but not so in the case of a mortgage of a ship. In England it is settled, that a mortgagee of a ship in possession, is entitled to all the rights of property. But if a vessel be mortgaged while at sea, some doubts have arisen. But here, by the statute, the deed has the same effect as if possession had been given. The mortgagee, therefore, has all the right of property; and if in the thing itself, he has it also in its profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this is not a mere mortgage. It is also an assignment of the freight itself. It is said to be the general understanding, that the mortgagor shall enjoy the profits until forfeiture, or possession given to the mortgagee. But if the mortgagor covenants expressly, that the mortgagee should receive the profits, this destroys the tacit presumption that the mortgagor should receive them. At best, a mortgagor is only '<i>like</i> a tenant at will,' and the mortgagee may put an end to his right of taking the profits whenever he pleases. He has the legal title to the rent. <i>Doug.</i> 282. <i>Moss</i> v. <i>Gallimore</i>. But it is said, that the freight was not <i>in esse</i>, and, therefore, could not be the subject of an assignment. But if the covenant does not operate as an assignment of the freight, it is sufficient to destroy the tacit understanding, that the mortgagors were to receive and might dispose of it as they pleased.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. In what relation does the defendant stand to the other parties?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here was no fraud on him. He had notice of the mortgage, and the appropriation of the freight to secure the plaintiff, before the vessel sailed. He took <i>an order</i> for his money on James Hamilton; which shows, that when he sailed, he did not depend upon the profits of this voyage, as to his claim of 800 dollars. If he had any <i>lien</i> on the freight, it was only for his wages arising during the same voyage. If there was any fraud, it was on <i>his</i> side. He never disclosed his claim to the plaintiff before he sailed, nor after his return, until the plaintiff had paid the expenses of the voyage. The record of the mortgage was notice to him, even if we had not proved actual knowledge on his part. The mortgagors and the defendant, as their agent, were trustees for the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a mortgagee of lands chooses to lay by, and not demand the rents, and the tenants pay them to the mortgagor, they shall be protected. But why? Because they had not notice. But if they pay the rent to the mortgagor after notice from the mortgagee, they pay in their own wrong. This is the case of the defendant. He knew that the mortgagors had no right to appropriate the freight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>February</i> 28, 1804.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MARSHALL, Ch.

Deeds of settlement upon marriage, wherein lands, slaves, money, or other personal thing, shall be settled or covenanted to be left, or paid at the death of the party, or otherwise, and all deeds of trust or mortgages whatsoever, that is, the consideration of which is marriage, or which relate to lands.

The fourth section of the act for regulating conveyances says, that all deeds of trust and mortgages <i>whatsoever</i>, shall be void, unless they shall be recorded according to the directions of that act; that is, in the county where the '<i>land conveyed lieth</i>.' Where, then, is a deed of mere personal property to be recorded?

It is contended, now, that if the mortgage is void, and the plaintiff had no right to receive the freight, he has paid the expenses of the voyage by mistake, and can recover upon that ground. But there is no evidence that the expectation of the freight was his motive for paying those expenses. On the contrary, he did not pay them until after he had taken possession of the vessel, under a new contract, as an absolute purchaser. The record does not state how much he disbursed, and, therefore, we cannot say how much he is entitled to recover back, even if he is entitled to recover any thing. But the defendant never received the money from the plaintiff for those disbursements. It is true he gave orders to the plaintiff to pay, but those orders were not for his own use, and he never actually received the money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\"><i>March</i> 2, 1805.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MARSHALL, Ch.

Upon inspecting the deed, which is the foundation of the action, it appears to have been admitted to record, on the oath of only two subscribing witnesses. This suggested the preliminary question, whether a deed of mortgage, so recorded, was not absolutely void as to creditors and subsequent purchasers? This question depends on the construction of two acts of the legislature of Virginia. The first is entitled, 'An act for regulating conveyances.' The 4th section of that act is in these words; 'All bargains, sales,' &amp;c. The first member of the sentence relates to lands only, the second to marriage settlement, wherein either lands or personal estate should be settled; and the third relates to deeds of trust and mortgages. Terms descriptive of personal estate are omitted, but the word 'whatsoever' would certainly comprehend a mortgage of a personal chattel, as well as of lands, if not restrained by other words manifesting an intent to restrain them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is argued, that this intent is clearly manifested. The whole act relates to real estate, except that part of it which respects marriage settlements. Its title is 'an act concerning conveyances,' and all its provisions are adapted to the conveyance of lands, except in the particular case of marriage settlements; and in that case, the act provides expressly for recording a settlement of chattels. This act, it is said, contains no 'directions' for recording a deed of trust or mortgage for a personal thing, and, consequently, such deed cannot be within it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first section of the act respects conveyances of lands only, and directs, that they shall be acknowledged or proved by the oath of three witnesses in the general court, or court of the district, county, city, or corporation in which the lands lie.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second respects marriage settlements, and directs, that if lands be conveyed or covenanted to be conveyed, they shall be proved and recorded in the same manner as had been prescribed in the first section; but if only slaves, money, or other personal thing be settled, the deed is to be proved and recorded before the court of the district, county, or corporation in which the party dwells, or as afterwards directed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third section relates only to the proving and recording of livery of seisin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then follows the fourth section, which requires, among other enumerated conveyances, that 'all deeds of trust and mortgages whatsoever' shall be void as to creditors and subsequent purchasers, if not acknowledged or proved, and recorded 'according to the directions of the act.' There being no 'directions' which are applied to mortgages, unless lands be conveyed in them, it has been argued, that such mortgages only, as convey lands, are comprehended within the act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The act, it must be acknowledged, is very obscurely penned in this particular respect, and there is so much strength in the argument for confining it to mortgages of lands, that, if a mortgage of a personal chattel could be brought within the provisions of any other act, the court would be disposed to adopt the construction contended for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff insists, that such a mortgage is comprehended in the 2d section of the 'act to prevent frauds and perjuries.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That act avoids fraudulent conveyances; and declares, that deeds of personal chattels, not upon a valuable consideration, where the possession remains with the donor; or, a reservation of interest in the donor, where possession passes to the donee, shall be fraudulent and void, unless proved and recorded according to the directions of the act. A mortgage made on a valuable consideration, would be very clearly excluded from the 2d section, although the act contained nothing further on the subject. But to remove the possibility of doubt, the 3d section declares, that the act shall not extend to any conveyance made 'upon good consideration and <i>bona fide</i>.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The meaning of the word 'good,' in the statute of frauds, is settled to be the same with 'valuable.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is, therefore, perfectly clear, that the case is altogether omitted, or is provided for in the act concerning conveyances. In a country where mortgages, of a particular kind of personal property, are frequent, it can scarcely be supposed that no provision would be made for so important and interesting a subject. The inconvenience resulting from the total want of such a provision would certainly be great; and the court, therefore, ought not to suppose the case to be entirely omitted, if there be any legislative act which may fairly be construed to comprehend it. The act concerning conveyances, although not penned with that clearness which is to be wished, does yet contain terms which are sufficient to embrace the case, and the best judicial opinions of that state concur in this exposition of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the point was not directly decided in the case of <i>Hill and Claiborne</i>, the court of appeals appear to have proceeded on this construction; and Judge <i>Tucker</i>, in discussing this subject, avows the same opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon a consideration of the acts on this subject, Butts being a creditor, it is the opinion of the court, that the deed of mortgage, in the proceedings mentioned, was void as to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The counsel for the plaintiff contends, that, although the mortgage-deed be void, yet Hodgson is entitled to recover, because he has paid money to the order of Butts, under the mistaken opinion that he was entitled to the freight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This allegation is not made out in point of fact. Hodgson was in possession of the vessel as the absolute purchaser before he paid for the disbursements he is now endeavouring to recover. It does not appear that he paid these disbursements in the confidence of receiving the freight, or that he was not compellable to pay them as owner of the vessel. The freight had previously been applied by Butts, under the authority of the Hamiltons, to the payment of a debt due to himself. He had a right, as a general creditor, to retain that freight as against the original owners, or their assignee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court is of opinion, that the judgment of the circuit court is to be affirmed with costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Probably alluding to the case of <i>Claiborne</i> v. <i>Hill</i>, 1 <i>Wash</i>, 177.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>7 U.S. 140 (____)</b></center>\n<center><b>3 Cranch 140</b></center>\n<center><h1>HODGSON<br>\nv.<br>\nBUTTS.</h1></center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center></center>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*144</span> E.J.

This act, it is said, contains no \"directions\" for recording a deed of trust or mortgage for a personal thing, and, consequently, such deed cannot be within it.</p>\n<p>The first section of the act respects conveyances of lands only, and directs, that they shall be acknowledged or proved by the oath of three witnesses in the general court, or court of the district, county, city, or corporation in which the lands lie.</p>\n<p>The second respects marriage settlements, and directs, that if lands be conveyed or covenanted to be conveyed, they shall be proved and recorded in the same manner as had been prescribed in the first section; but if only slaves, money, or other personal thing be settled, the deed is to be proved and recorded before the court of the district, county, or corporation in which the party dwells, or as afterwards directed.</p>\n<p>The third section relates only to the proving and recording of livery of seisin.</p>\n<p>Then follows the fourth section, which requires, among other enumerated conveyances, that \"all deeds of trust and mortgages whatsoever\" shall be void as to creditors and subsequent purchasers, if not acknowledged or proved, and recorded \"according to the directions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*157</span> of the act.\" There being no \"directions\" which are applied to mortgages, unless lands be conveyed in them, it has been argued, that such mortgages only, as convey lands, are comprehended within the act.</p>\n<p>The act, it must be acknowledged, is very obscurely penned in this particular respect, and there is so much strength in the argument for confining it to mortgages of lands, that, if a mortgage of a personal chattel could be brought within the provisions of any other act, the court would be disposed to adopt the construction contended for.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff insists, that such a mortgage is comprehended in the 2d section of the \"act to prevent frauds and perjuries.\"</p>\n<p>That act avoids fraudulent conveyances; and declares, that deeds of personal chattels, not upon a valuable consideration, where the possession remains with the donor; or, a reservation of interest in the donor, where possession passes to the donee, shall be fraudulent and void, unless proved and recorded according to the directions of the act. A mortgage made on a valuable consideration, would be very clearly excluded from the 2d section, although the act contained nothing further on the subject. But to remove the possibility of doubt, the 3d section declares, that the act shall not extend to any conveyance made \"upon good consideration and bona fide.\"</p>\n<p>The meaning of the word \"good,\" in the statute of frauds, is settled to be the same with \"valuable.\"</p>\n<p>It is, therefore, perfectly clear, that the case is altogether omitted, or is provided for in the act concerning conveyances. In a country where mortgages, of a particular kind of personal property, are frequent, it can scarcely be supposed that no provision would be made for so important and interesting a subject. The inconvenience resulting from the total want of such a provision would certainly be great; and the court, therefore, ought not to suppose the case to be entirely omitted, if there be any legislative act which may fairly be construed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*158</span> to comprehend it. The act concerning conveyances, although not penned with that clearness which is to be wished, does yet contain terms which are sufficient to embrace the case, and the best judicial opinions of that state concur in this exposition of it.</p>\n<p>Although the point was not directly decided in the case of Hill and Claiborne, the court of appeals appear to have proceeded on this construction; and Judge Tucker, in discussing this subject, avows the same opinion.</p>\n<p>Upon a consideration of the acts on this subject, Butts being a creditor, it is the opinion of the court, that the deed of mortgage, in the proceedings mentioned, was void as to him.</p>\n<p>The counsel for the plaintiff contends, that, although the mortgage-deed be void, yet Hodgson is entitled to recover, because he has paid money to the order of Butts, under the mistaken opinion that he was entitled to the freight.</p>\n<p>This allegation is not made out in point of fact. Hodgson was in possession of the vessel as the absolute purchaser before he paid for the disbursements he is now endeavouring to recover. It does not appear that he paid these disbursements in the confidence of receiving the freight, or that he was not compellable to pay them as owner of the vessel. The freight had previously been applied by Butts, under the authority of the Hamiltons, to the payment of a debt due to himself. He had a right, as a general creditor, to retain that freight as against the original owners, or their assignee.</p>\n<p>The court is of opinion, that the judgment of the circuit court is to be affirmed with costs.</p>\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "<div>\n<center><b><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></span> (____)</b></center>\n<center><b>3 Cranch 140</b></center>\n<center><h1>HODGSON<br>\nv.<br>\nBUTTS.</h1></center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center></center>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*144</span> E.J. Lee, for plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*155</span> MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>This suit was instituted to recover the freight of a vessel of which the plaintiff was a mortgagee. Upon inspecting the deed, which is the foundation of the action, it appears to have been admitted to record, on the oath of only two subscribing witnesses. This suggested the preliminary question, whether a deed of mortgage, so recorded, was not absolutely void as to creditors and subsequent purchasers? This question depends on the construction of two acts of the legislature of Virginia. The first is entitled, \"An act for regulating conveyances.\" The 4th section of that act is in these words; <span class=\"star-pagination\">*156</span> \"All bargains, sales,\" &amp;c. The first member of the sentence relates to lands only, the second to marriage settlements, wherein either lands or personal estate should be settled; and the third relates to deeds of trust and mortgages. Terms descriptive of personal estate are omitted, but the word \"whatsoever\" would certainly comprehend a mortgage of a personal chattel, as well as of lands, if not restrained by other words manifesting an intent to restrain them.</p>\n<p>It is argued, that this intent is clearly manifested. The whole act relates to real estate, except that part of it which respects marriage settlements. Its title is \"an act concerning conveyances,\" and all its provisions are adapted to the conveyance of lands, except in the particular case of marriage settlements; and in that case, the act provides expressly for recording a settlement of chattels. This act, it is said, contains no \"directions\" for recording a deed of trust or mortgage for a personal thing, and, consequently, such deed cannot be within it.</p>\n<p>The first section of the act respects conveyances of lands only, and directs, that they shall be acknowledged or proved by the oath of three witnesses in the general court, or court of the district, county, city, or corporation in which the lands lie.</p>\n<p>The second respects marriage settlements, and directs, that if lands be conveyed or covenanted to be conveyed, they shall be proved and recorded in the same manner as had been prescribed in the first section; but if only slaves, money, or other personal thing be settled, the deed is to be proved and recorded before the court of the district, county, or corporation in which the party dwells, or as afterwards directed.</p>\n<p>The third section relates only to the proving and recording of livery of seisin.</p>\n<p>Then follows the fourth section, which requires, among other enumerated conveyances, that \"all deeds of trust and mortgages whatsoever\" shall be void as to creditors and subsequent purchasers, if not acknowledged or proved, and recorded \"according to the directions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*157</span> of the act.\" There being no \"directions\" which are applied to mortgages, unless lands be conveyed in them, it has been argued, that such mortgages only, as convey lands, are comprehended within the act.</p>\n<p>The act, it must be acknowledged, is very obscurely penned in this particular respect, and there is so much strength in the argument for confining it to mortgages of lands, that, if a mortgage of a personal chattel could be brought within the provisions of any other act, the court would be disposed to adopt the construction contended for.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff insists, that such a mortgage is comprehended in the 2d section of the \"act to prevent frauds and perjuries.\"</p>\n<p>That act avoids fraudulent conveyances; and declares, that deeds of personal chattels, not upon a valuable consideration, where the possession remains with the donor; or, a reservation of interest in the donor, where possession passes to the donee, shall be fraudulent and void, unless proved and recorded according to the directions of the act. A mortgage made on a valuable consideration, would be very clearly excluded from the 2d section, although the act contained nothing further on the subject.
