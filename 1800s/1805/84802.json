The bill having been taken for confessed against Ray, a decree was obtained by Law for a sale. The sale had been made under the decree, and notice given, that on a certain day the sale would be ratified unless cause was shown. On that day Ray appeared, but not showing good cause, in the opinion of the court, the sale was confirmed. Ray prayed an appeal to this court on the decree for the sale, which the court refused, on the ground, as it is understood, that the decree for the sale was not a <i>final</i> decree in the cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ray on this day presented a petition to this court setting forth those facts, among others, praying relief, and that this court would direct the court below to send up the record.
