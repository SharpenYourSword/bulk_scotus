At the return of the subpoena, Caldcleugh, Boyd and Reid, appeared and filed a petition, stating themselves to be aliens, and subjects of the king of Great Britain, and that the complainant was a citizen of the state of South Carolina, and praying that the cause might be removed to the circuit court of the United, according to the 12th section of the judiciary act of 1789. To which petition, Gordon, the complainant, answered, that the prayer thereof ought not to be granted, because Gillespie and M'Kay, two of the defendants, were citizens of the state of South Carolina. But the court, 'after observing that the parties defendants to the suit, <i>residing in this state</i>, were stakeholders, and not materially concerned in the determination of the cause, ordered that it be transferred to the federal court, agreeable to the prayer of the petition.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complainant immediately, in the same court, assigned errors, in the following form: 'Whereupon the said James Gordon, comes and says, that in the giving of the final judgment, in the cause aforesaid, upon the construction of the 12th clause or section of the statute of the United States, entitled an act to establish the judicial courts of the United States, passed the 24th day of September, 1789, and 2d section of the 3d article of the constitution of the United States, and the 12th article of the amendment of the constitution, there is manifest error in this, to wit, that the judgment aforesaid was given in form aforesaid, for the said Caldcleugh, Boyd and Reid, upon their petition, for the removal of the said cause for trial, into the circuit court of the United States, to be held for the district of South Carolina, whereas judgment should have been given for the said James Gordon, against the removal aforesaid, and this he is ready to verify.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caldcleugh, Boyd, and Reid joined in error; and thus the case came up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The writ of error did not state, that the court of equity, of the state of South Carolina, to the judges of which it was directed, was '<i>the highest court of equity, of the state in which a decision in the suit could be had</i>,' so as to bring the case within the provisions of the 25<i>th section of the judiciary act of</i> 1789, nor did that fact in any other manner appear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>E.
