To which refusal and instruction the defendant excepted; and the judgment below being against him, he brought his writ of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the opening of the case, <i>This Court, without argument, reversed the judgment</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a subsequent day, <i>C.

In that case, the counsel for the defendant admitted, that when the party has <i>done any thing to preclude himself from going into the contract</i>, then money had and received will lie. <i>Buller</i>, J. said 'the defendant left it in the power of the plaintiff <i>to put an end to the contract</i>.

The court was clearly of opinion, that 'as by the defendant's default the plaintiffs could not perform what they had undertaken to do, they had a right to put an end to the whole contract, and recover back the money they had paid under it.' So here, Simms contended, that as the defendant had prevented the plaintiff from completing the contract, the plaintiff had a right to put an end to it. If he had paid money under the contract, he would have had a right to recover it back; but as instead of advancing money, he had done work and labour, which could not be recovered back <i>in specie</i>, he had a right to recover its value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So in 1 <i>Powell on Contracts</i>, 417.
