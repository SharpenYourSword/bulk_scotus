By the act of assembly of Maryland, 1791. <i>c.</i> 67. entitled 'an act for regulating the mode of <i>staying execution</i>, and for repealing the acts of assembly therein mentioned,' it is enacted, that no execution shall issue upon any judgment, provided the <i>person or persons</i> against whom such judgment is obtained, shall come before <i>two justices of the peace of the county</i>, where such person or persons shall reside, within two months after the rendition of such judgment, and together with two other persons, such as the said justices shall approve of, and confess judgment for <i>his</i> debt and costs of suit adjudged, with stay of execution for six months thereafter; which confession shall be made in manner and form following, that is to say 'you H.

And it is further enacted, that the justices shall return the confession of judgment to the clerk of the court, where the first judgment was rendered, by the next court in course, to be entered on record; and after the expiration of the time limited in such confession, it shall be lawful to take out execution thereon, without a <i>scire facias</i> or any other delay, against either the principal or the security, or all or either of them for such judgment so confessed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the provisions of this act, the original defendant <i>jacob Mountz</i> (without his co-defendant George Reintzel) went before John Ott and Daniel Reintzel, and, together with Henry Knowles and <i>John</i> Mountz, his sureties, confessed judgment to Hodgson and Thompson, in the form prescribed by the act of assembly.

Suppose there should be five solvent defendants, and one insolvent who supersedes the judgment with two sureties; the plaintiff cannot take out execution against the five, until the expiration of the six months.
