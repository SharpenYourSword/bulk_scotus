The bill charges the land as being still the estate of John Rae, deceased, formerly one of the partners in the firm of Rae and Somerville, and that all the joint funds were exhausted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no appearance for the defendant <i>Caroline;</i> but the defendant <i>Elizabeth</i> appeared, and pleaded, that her late husband, Daniel Course, purchased the land fairly and bona fide at public sale from the tax-gatherer, for the sum of 552 dollars and 89 cents, without notice of any claim, title or interest of the complainants in the said land, if any they have. The plea avers that the consideration money was paid to the tax-gatherer; that he had a right to sell the land for default in payment of taxes; that the taxes were not paid at the time of sale, which was publicly made, after legal notice; that Daniel Course took immediate possession, and died seised thereof, and at his death it descended to his heirs, of whom the defendant Elizabeth is one.

A <i>plea</i> in equity must of itself constitute a complete defence. It can derive no aid from the answer. The answer cannot come into view until the plea be disposed of. If the plea be good the answer is unnecessary; and in considering the validity of the plea, every allegation of the bill, not answered by the plea, is to be taken to be true. <i>Mitford</i>, 15. 177. 2 <i>Atk.</i> 630. <i>Story</i> v. <i>Windsor</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. But if these defects of the plea should be considered as cured by the replication, yet it appears upon the whole record that the facts of the plea are not true, and that the sale of the collector transferred no right in the land to Daniel Course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1st.

The collector had no authority, under the circumstances of the case, to sell; and if he had authority, he has not executed it legally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The sale was fraudulent. The circumstances indicating fraud are, that the lands were liable in equity to the debts of John Rae. That the taxes were not paid for 1790 and 1791, although there was personal estate enough in the hands of the representatives of Robert Rae, in whose occupation the lands were, to pay them. This appears by Hammond's return of property, in which he has returned 56 negroes as the property of Robert Rae. That notwithstanding this personal property was in his hands, Hammond, who had married Robert Rae's widow, the mother of the defendant Elizabeth Course, not only permitted the land to be sold for taxes, but requested it might be sold, and pointed out this very land as the object of sale. The advertisement described the land by its least notorious appellation. It mentions neither the name of the owner of the land, nor the amount of taxes due. Hammond's son-in-law, the husband of the defendant, became the purchaser. There can be no doubt that he must have known the situation of the estate. He knew it was liable for the debts of John Rae. He knew that there was personal estate sufficient to pay the taxes. He knew that his father-in-law ought to have paid them; and he knew that he had directed the collector to sell the land. He knew the price which he gave for the land was far below its value; for the bill states it was sold in 1799 for 2,386 dollars, and the defendant, in her answer, says that it was then sold far below its value. He and his father-in-law and their wives were the representatives of Robert Rae, and were the only persons, except creditors, who were interested in the lands. These circumstances go strongly to show that the sale by the collector was only the means used to defeat the creditors of their just debts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The collector had no authority to sell these lands for taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1st. Because there was sufficient personal property, of which he had notice by the return of Hammond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2d. Because he was not authorised in any case to sell more land than was sufficient to pay the taxes. The price which Daniel Course gave at this pretended sale was 552 dollars; the same lands, in 1799, sold under the decree of the court for 2,386 dollars, which the defendant in her answer says was far below their value, and yet the utmost amount of taxes which could be claimed, even supposing that all the taxes for 1790 and 1791, due from the estate of Robert Rae, for property wherever situated in Georgia, could be charged upon this one tract of land, would not exceed 150 dollars; and if, as we contend, this tract is liable for its own taxes only, the amount could not exceed 10 or 12 dollars. All special authorities are to be <i>rigidly pursued</i> and <i>strictly construed. Cowp.</i> 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3d. Because the collector could not sell after the first The 15th of December was the time limited for the debtors to pay their taxes, and from that time till the 1st of March was allowed to the collector to enforce payment by distress and sale; and on that day he was bound to close his accounts, and pay over the monies collected to the treasurer. Whether he had collected or not, he was bound to pay; and the law did not give him this summary remedy to indemnify himself for any taxes he might advance. If it did, it must give him a lien for an indefinite time, which cannot be supposed to have been the intention of the legislature. It is a special power, of an extrajudicial nature, to perform a duty in a certain time, and he is bound to pursue his authority strictly. If he paid the taxes which he had not collected, the power to distrain did not continue for his benefit. It is to be presumed that he did his duty, unless the contrary appears, and that he did pay the taxes which he was bound to collect, and had failed to collect, at the time when he was bound to close his accounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4th. Because the advertisement did not sufficiently describe the land. It is simply called 450 acres of land lying on <i>Pipemaker's creek</i>, without mentioning the <i>Savannah</i> river, on which it was also bounded, and which was a more notorious object. It neither mentions the person from whom the taxes were due, nor their amount, nor the name of the owner of the land. The advertisement has no date, nor is it stated what notice was given, nor how it was published.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no evidence of the amount of the taxes due, nor of the amount demanded; nor of the amount of taxes for the non-payment of which the land was sold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It does not appear that <i>Courvoisie</i> was collector for the years 1790 and 1791.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Martin</i>, contra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purchaser from a collector of taxes has a good title without deed.

No advertisement is required by law in the proceedings of the collector. There is no replication to the answer, and therefore all the facts it contains are to be taken to be true, so far as it is responsive to the bill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was not necessary to state in the plea that any person was seised of the land, nor who was liable for the taxes.

The certificate of Hammond was a year preceding that time; and the personal property might have been sold; but if there was, the purchaser of the real estate is not to be prejudiced thereby; it is a matter between the person liable for taxes and the officer who sold the land when he might have sold the personal estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If an executor have power by will to sell land for payment of debts, in case of a deficiency of personal assets, and he sells, although the personal assets were sufficient, yet the purchaser of the land will be protected. 1 <i>Eq.

He was not obliged to describe it as lying on the Savannah. The law did not require him to name the person who had title to or was in possession of the land, nor the name of the <i>person</i> liable for the taxes, nor their amount. There is no proof of fraud but what arises from those circumstances, and the relationship between Mrs. Hammond and Mrs. Course; and these are only circumstances, which at most may excite a suspicion. The presumption of law is always against fraud. It must always be proved. And unless it be not only <i>proved</i>, but brought home to the purchaser, the sale cannot be set aside.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>P.

J. delivered the opinion of the court, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs, who were the creditors of Rae and Somerville, brought this bill to subject a tract of land in the possession of the defendants to the payment of a debt for which they had obtained a decree against Rae and Somerville.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants plead that Daniel Course, under whom they claim by descent, is a fair purchaser, for a valuable consideration, of the premises in question, at a sale thereof, by the collector of taxes for the county in which they lie, made for taxes in arrear. The defendant also answered, denying fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A replication was filed to this plea, and on a hearing it was sustained, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case the merits of the claim cannot be examined. The only questions before this court are upon the sufficiency of the plea to bar the action, and the sufficiency of the testimony to support the plea as pleaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first point, the counsel for the plaintiff has adduced authority which would certainly apply strongly, if not conclusively in his favour, if a special demurrer had been filed to the plea: But as issue has been taken on it, the court thinks it sufficient, since it contains, in substance, matter which, if true, would bar the action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The replication puts the matter of the plea in issue, and it is incumbent on the defendants to support it. They prove a sale by the collector on account of taxes, and adduce a deed conveying the premises to the purchaser. But this testimony alone is not sufficient to support the plea. The validity of the sale is the subject of controversy, and its validity depends on the authority of the collector to sell, and on the fairness of the transaction. It would be going too far to say that a collector selling land with or without authority, could, by his conveyance, transfer the title of the rightful proprietor. He must act in conformity with the law from which his power is derived, and the purchaser is bound to inquire whether he has so acted. It is true that full evidence of every minute circumstance ought not, especially at a distant day, to be required. From the establishment of some facts, it is possible that others may be presumed, and less than positive testimony may establish facts. In this case, as in all others depending on testimony, a sound discretion, regulated by the law of evidence, will be exercised. But it is incumbent on the vendee to prove the authority to sell, and the question respecting the fairness of the sale will then stand on the same principles with any other transaction in which fraud is charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In examining the law under which this sale was made, the court perceives that the collector is authorised to sell land only on the deficiency of personal estate; and then to sell only so much as is necessary to pay the tax in arrear. In this case a sale is made of a whole tract of land, without specifying the amount of taxes actually due for which that land was liable and could be sold. This is proceeding in a manner not strictly regular. The sale ought to have been of so much of the land as would satisfy the tax in arrear. Should it be true that the land was actually liable for the whole sum for which it sold, it would still be incumbent on the vendee to prove that fact; for it cannot be presumed. Every presumption arising from the testimony in the cause is against it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had this fact been established, the court is inclined to think that the circumstances of the case as stated, though not perhaps amounting to proof of fraud, afford such presumptions as would render a final decree, without further testimony, unsatisfactory, and that an issue ought to have been directed on the question whether the sale was fraudulent or not. But if a whole tract of land was sold when a small part of it would have been sufficient for the taxes, which at present appears to be the case, the collector unquestionably exceeded his authority, and the plea cannot be substained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is, therefore, the opinion of the court, that there is error in the decree of the circuit court for the district of Georgia, in sustaining the plea of the defendants, and dismissing the bill of the plaintiffs, and that the said decree ought to be reversed and annulled, and the cause remanded, with directions that the defendants shall answer over, and that further proceedings be had in the said cause, according to equity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Decree reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

The plea avers that the consideration money was paid to the tax-gatherer; that he had a right to sell the land for default in payment of taxes; that the taxes were not paid at the time of sale, which was publicly made, after legal notice; that Daniel Course took immediate possession, and died seised thereof, and at his death it descended to his heirs, of whom the defendant Elizabeth is one.

The sale was fraudulent. The circumstances indicating fraud are, that the lands were liable in equity to the debts of John Rae. That the taxes were not paid for 1790 and 1791, although there was personal estate enough in the hands of the representatives of Robert Rae, in whose occupation the lands were, to pay them. This appears by Hammond's return of property, in which he has returned 56 negroes as the property of Robert Rae. That notwithstanding this personal property was in his hands, Hammond, who had married Robert Rae's widow, the mother of the defendant Elizabeth Course, not only permitted the land to be sold for taxes, but requested it might be sold, and pointed out this very land as the object of sale. The advertisement described the land by its least notorious appellation. It mentions neither the name of the owner of the land, nor the amount of taxes due. Hammond's son-in-law, the husband of the defendant, became the purchaser. There can be no doubt that he must have known the situation of the estate. He knew it was liable for the debts of John Rae. He knew that there was personal estate sufficient to pay the taxes. He knew that his father-in-law ought to have paid them; and he knew that he had directed the collector to sell the land. He knew the price which he gave for the land was far below its value; for the bill states it was sold in 1799 for 2,386 dollars, and the defendant, in her answer, says that it was then sold far below its value. He and his father-in-law and their wives were the representatives of Robert Rae, and were the only persons, except creditors, who were interested in the lands. These circumstances go strongly to show that the sale by the collector was only the means used to defeat the creditors of their just debts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

Because he was not authorised in any case to sell more land than was sufficient to pay the taxes. The price which Daniel Course gave at this pretended sale was 552 dollars; the same lands, in 1799, sold under the decree of the court for 2,386 dollars, which the defendant in her answer says was far below their value, and yet the utmost amount of taxes which could be claimed, even supposing that all the taxes for 1790 and 1791, due from the estate of Robert Rae, for property wherever situated in Georgia, could be charged upon this one tract of land, would not exceed 150 dollars; and if, as we contend, this tract is liable for its own taxes only, the amount could not exceed 10 or 12 dollars. All special authorities are to be <i>rigidly pursued</i> and <i>strictly construed.

Because the collector could not sell after the first The 15th of December was the time limited for the debtors to pay their taxes, and from that time till the 1st of March was allowed to the collector to enforce payment by distress and sale; and on that day he was bound to close his accounts, and pay over the monies collected to the treasurer. Whether he had collected or not, he was bound to pay; and the law did not give him this summary remedy to indemnify himself for any taxes he might advance. If it did, it must give him a lien for an indefinite time, which cannot be supposed to have been the intention of the legislature. It is a special power, of an extrajudicial nature, to perform a duty in a certain time, and he is bound to pursue his authority strictly. If he paid the taxes which he had not collected, the power to distrain did not continue for his benefit. It is to be presumed that he did his duty, unless the contrary appears, and that he did pay the taxes which he was bound to collect, and had failed to collect, at the time when he was bound to close his accounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4th.

He was not obliged to describe it as lying on the Savannah. The law did not require him to name the person who had title to or was in possession of the land, nor the name of the <i>person</i> liable for the taxes, nor their amount. There is no proof of fraud but what arises from those circumstances, and the relationship between Mrs. Hammond and Mrs. Course; and these are only circumstances, which at most may excite a suspicion. The presumption of law is always against fraud. It must always be proved. And unless it be not only <i>proved</i>, but brought home to the purchaser, the sale cannot be set aside.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>P.

It must stand on its own foundation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The answer cannot be brought into view until the question upon the plea be decided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was not necessary for the bill to state all the facts which may be given in evidence of fraud. It is sufficient if fraud be positively charged in general terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule of law is not that every thing is to be presumed in favour of the purchaser; but that a purchaser who claims title under a special limited authority, a <i>power</i> naked and without interest, must show that the power has been strictly pursued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctrine advanced on the other side, that whether the taxes were due or not, the purchaser is protected in his title, is hazardous in the extreme; it would subject all our estates to the control of a collector of taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cases cited do not support the doctrine. They only show that, where lands are devised for the payment of debts <i>generally</i>, the purchaser is not bound to see to the application of the money; or to inquire whether there be personal estate sufficient to pay the debts; but if lands are devised to pay <i>certain</i> debts <i>specified in a schedule</i>, there the purchaser must see to the application of the money. The case cited from 2 <i>P.

There were different collectors in different counties, who had separate and independent powers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\"><i>March</i> 14.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs, who were the creditors of Rae and Somerville, brought this bill to subject a tract of land in the possession of the defendants to the payment of a debt for which they had obtained a decree against Rae and Somerville.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants plead that Daniel Course, under whom they claim by descent, is a fair purchaser, for a valuable consideration, of the premises in question, at a sale thereof, by the collector of taxes for the county in which they lie, made for taxes in arrear. The defendant also answered, denying fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A replication was filed to this plea, and on a hearing it was sustained, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case the merits of the claim cannot be examined. The only questions before this court are upon the sufficiency of the plea to bar the action, and the sufficiency of the testimony to support the plea as pleaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first point, the counsel for the plaintiff has adduced authority which would certainly apply strongly, if not conclusively in his favour, if a special demurrer had been filed to the plea: But as issue has been taken on it, the court thinks it sufficient, since it contains, in substance, matter which, if true, would bar the action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The replication puts the matter of the plea in issue, and it is incumbent on the defendants to support it. They prove a sale by the collector on account of taxes, and adduce a deed conveying the premises to the purchaser. But this testimony alone is not sufficient to support the plea. The validity of the sale is the subject of controversy, and its validity depends on the authority of the collector to sell, and on the fairness of the transaction. It would be going too far to say that a collector selling land with or without authority, could, by his conveyance, transfer the title of the rightful proprietor. He must act in conformity with the law from which his power is derived, and the purchaser is bound to inquire whether he has so acted. It is true that full evidence of every minute circumstance ought not, especially at a distant day, to be required. From the establishment of some facts, it is possible that others may be presumed, and less than positive testimony may establish facts. In this case, as in all others depending on testimony, a sound discretion, regulated by the law of evidence, will be exercised. But it is incumbent on the vendee to prove the authority to sell, and the question respecting the fairness of the sale will then stand on the same principles with any other transaction in which fraud is charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In examining the law under which this sale was made, the court perceives that the collector is authorised to sell land only on the deficiency of personal estate; and then to sell only so much as is necessary to pay the tax in arrear. In this case a sale is made of a whole tract of land, without specifying the amount of taxes actually due for which that land was liable and could be sold. This is proceeding in a manner not strictly regular. The sale ought to have been of so much of the land as would satisfy the tax in arrear. Should it be true that the land was actually liable for the whole sum for which it sold, it would still be incumbent on the vendee to prove that fact; for it cannot be presumed. Every presumption arising from the testimony in the cause is against it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had this fact been established, the court is inclined to think that the circumstances of the case as stated, though not perhaps amounting to proof of fraud, afford such presumptions as would render a final decree, without further testimony, unsatisfactory, and that an issue ought to have been directed on the question whether the sale was fraudulent or not. But if a whole tract of land was sold when a small part of it would have been sufficient for the taxes, which at present appears to be the case, the collector unquestionably exceeded his authority, and the plea cannot be substained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is, therefore, the opinion of the court, that there is error in the decree of the circuit court for the district of Georgia, in sustaining the plea of the defendants, and dismissing the bill of the plaintiffs, and that the said decree ought to be reversed and annulled, and the cause remanded, with directions that the defendants shall answer over, and that further proceedings be had in the said cause, according to equity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Decree reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
