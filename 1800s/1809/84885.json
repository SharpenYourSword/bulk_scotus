There was no settlement made, nor any receipt given. 'Whereupon the plaintiff prayed the court to instruct the jury, that if from the evidence they should be satisfied that the bond had not been fully paid off, no declaration of the plaintiff's '<i>that his claims against the defendant were all satisfied</i>' would be a bar to his recovery in this action; which instruction the court refused to give as prayed, but directed the jury that if they should be satisfied by the evidence, that the defendant, in the year 1797, paid the plaintiff a sum of money less than the amount mentioned in the condition of the bond, which the plaintiff at that time acknowledged to be in full satisfaction of all his claims against the defendant, such payment and such acknowledgment, are competent evidence upon the plea of payment, and that the jury may and ought to presume therefrom that the whole sum mentioned in the condition of the said bond has been paid to the plaintiff, unless such presumption be repelled by other evidence in the cause; to which refusal and instruction the plaintiff excepted.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The verdict being for the defendant, his counsel moved the court for a new trial, and grounded his motion upon sundry affidavits tending to prove that the whole amount of the bond remained due to the plaintiff, and that he was surprised by unexpected testimony at the trial.
