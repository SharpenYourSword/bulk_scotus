Upon which verdict the judgment of the court was 'that the plaintiff recover against the defendant her damages aforesaid in form aforesaid assessed, and also her costs by her about her suit in this behalf expended, to be levied of the goods and chattels of the said Bryan Fairfax, deceased, at the time of his death, in the hands of the said defendant to be administered, if so much, &amp;c. but if he hath not so much, then the costs aforesaid to be levied of the proper goods and chattels of the said defendant; and the said defendant in mercy,' &amp;c.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The error relied upon by the plaintiff in error was, that the jury had not found the amount of assets in his hands to be administered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Swann</i>, for the plaintiff in error, having cited <i>Esp.

The sum found by the jury would not alter the judgment. It would still have been for the whole debt <i>de bonis testatoris si, &amp;c.</i> and <i>si non</i>, then the costs <i>de bonis propriis</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But here the jury have in substance found that the <i>defendant had assets more than sufficient to satisfy the debt due to the plaintiff;</i> for that is the allegation of the plaintiff in her replication, and the jury have found the issue for the plaintiff upon that replication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not more necessary to find specially upon this issue than upon <i>non assumpsit</i> or <i>nil debet</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a difference between this case and that of <i>Booth's Executors</i> v. <i>Armstrong</i>, 2 <i>Wash.</i> 301., for there the finding was not, as here, generally, '<i>we find the issues for the plaintiff;</i>' but '<i>we find for the plaintiff the debt in the declaration mentioned, and one penny damages</i>.'
