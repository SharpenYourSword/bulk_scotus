By that act, which was passed December 12, 1792, it is ordered, that 'one month after he plaintiff hath filed his declaration he may give a rule to plead with the clerk, and if the defendant shall not plead accordingly at the expiration of such rule, the plaintiff may enter judgment for his debt or damages and costs.' 'All rules to declare, plead, reply, rejoin, or for other proceedings, shall be given regularly from month to month, shall be entered in a book to be kept for that purpose, and shall expire on the succeeding rule day.' By the 25th section of that act, it is provided that in certain cases the sheriff may take the engagement of an attorney of the court, endorsed on the writ, that he will appear for the defendant, 'and such appearance shall be entered with the clerk in the office, <i>on the first day after the end of the court to which such process is returnable, which</i> <i>is hereby declared to be the appearance day in all process returnable to any day of the court next preceding.'</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the act of congress of 27th of February, 1801, it is declared that the laws of Virginia, as they then existed, should be and remain in force in that part of the district of Columbia which was ceded by Virguia to the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the act of congress of the 3d of March, 1801, &#167; 3. it is enacted, that the circuit court for the county of Alexandria, shall possess and exercise the same powers and jurisdiction civil and criminal as was then possessed and exercised by the district courts of Virginia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By he act of assembly of Virginia, passed on the 23d of November, 1792, and which incorporated the bank, it is ordered, that in suits brought by the bank, upon notes made negotiable therein, an issue shall be made up, and trial had at the return term of the writ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Toungs</i>, for the plaintiff in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The act of 27th of February, 1801, conferred on the circuit court for the district of Columbia, no other powers than those which had been given generally to the circuit courts of the United States, by the act passed in the same session, <i>vol.</i> 5. <i>p.</i> 237. &#167; 11, and by that act no such power is given to those courts in respect to the debts due to the bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 3d section of the act of the 3d of March, 1801, relates to criminal jurisdiction only, or if it relates to the civil jurisdiction, it is not clear that the district courts of Virginia could exercise the power, because those courts were established after the act incorporating the bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When this case was before this court at the last term, upon the motion to quash the writ of error, this court decided that so much of the charter as took away the right of appeal from the debtors to the bank, in the courts of Virginia, did not apply to the courts of the United States; and a distination was taken between the <i>rights</i> which the bank had as a body corporate and its <i>remedies</i> derived from particular provisions in its charter.

There has never been a doubt but that the district courts of Virginia had jurisdiction in cases in which the bank was plaintiff, and was bound, if requested, to compel the defendant to go to trial at the return term.
