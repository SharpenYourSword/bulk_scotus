That the judgment in this record is dependent upon some other judgment is apparent from the bond which recites a prior execution and seizure, by the marshal, of the property mentioned in the condition, for the purpose of satisfying it; but it does not appear judicially to the Court that the recited execution issued upon the identical judgment which has been reversed.
