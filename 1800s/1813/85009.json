The Defendant, Jay, pleaded the statute of limitations of Maryland, 1715, <i>ch.</i> 23, which limits actions of assumpsit to three years after the cause of action shall have accrued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this plea the Plaintiffs replied 'that at the time when the several sums of money in the declaration mentioned grew due, viz. on the 20th of March, 1799 and long before, to wit, on the 27th of November, 1797, and from thence until the said 20th of March, and from the said last mentioned day until the suing forth the original writ in this suit, the Plaintiffs were merchants, carrying on trade and merchandize under the name and firm of Bond and Brooks, and residing and carrying on trade without the limits of the district aforesaid, and of the state of Maryland, viz. at Philadelphia, in the state of Pennsylvania; and that at the several times aforesaid the said Jay and Christie were merchants, trading under the firm of Samuel Jay and Company, and residing and carrying on trade at and within the district aforesaid, and that on the said several days, and on sundry days from the first of those days to the second of those days the Plaintiffs were engaged in mutual trade and merchandize with the said Jay and Christie, by reason of which trade, and of and concerning the same, the said several sums of money in the declaration mentioned grew due to the Plaintiffs, and this they are ready to verify; wherefore,' &amp;c.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this replication the Defendant <i>rejoined</i>, that the Plaintiffs ought not to have and maintain their said action by reason of any thing alleged in their replication aforesaid; because, protesting, that the said several sums of money in the declaration aforesaid mentioned, do not concern the trade and merchandize between merchant and merchant; and also protesting that the Plaintiffs have not continued to reside without the state of Maryland and district aforesaid since the contracting and growing due of the said several sums of money, and until the suing out the original writ in this cause; yet, for answer to the said replication, the said Samuel Jay says that true it is that at the time of the contracting and growing due of the said several sums of money, he, the said Samuel and the said Christie, were merchants and residents within the state and district of Maryland aforesaid, and continued to reside therein until the decease of the said Christie, and the said Samuel has continued to reside therein ever since; and that the several sums of money in the declaration mentioned had become due and were payable on the 20th of March, 1799, to wit, at the district aforesaid; and that afterwards, to wit, on the 20th of May, 1799, the Plaintiffs returned to, came, and were within the state aforesaid, to wit, at the district aforesaid; and that afterwards, to wit, on the 18th day of October, 1799, the said <i>Joshua B. Bond</i> came to, and was within the said state, viz. at the district aforesaid; and that the original writ in this cause was sued forth on the 19th day of May, 1809, and not before; and so the said Samuel Jay saith that three years and more had elapsed and expired, after the return of the Plaintiffs and of the said Joshua B. Bond to, and after their being within the said state and district, and after the contracting and growing due of the said several sums of money, and before the suing out of the said original writ in this cause, viz. at the district aforesaid; and this the said Samuel is ready to verify, wherefore,' &amp;c.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this rejoinder there was a general demurrer and joinder.

The Defendant pleaded the statute of limitations, to which the Plaintiff replied that the Plaintiff, who resided in the state of Pennsylvania, and the Defendant were employed in mutual trade and merchandize, of and concerning which the said several sums of money in the said declaration mentioned grew due. The Defendant rejoins that the Plaintiff came within the state of Maryland in 1797, and that the original writ in this cause issued on the 5th of July, 1808, and not before. The Plaintiff demurred, and upon argument the demurrer was overruled and the bar adjudged to be good.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A writ of error has been sued out to the judgment of the Circuit Court, and the questions in the cause are,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Is the replication good in itself?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

The material part of that act is in these words: 'Be it enacted, That all actions, &amp;c. other than such accounts as concerns the trade of merchandize between merchant and merchant, their factors and servants <i>which are not residents within this province</i>,' &amp;c. 'shall be commenced or sued within three years ensuing the cause of such action, and not after.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the Plaintiffs it is contended, that if either party reside without the province the case is within the exception:&#8212;by the Defendant, that to bring the case within the exception both parties must reside without the province.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so unusual for a legislature to employ itself in framing rules which are to operate only on contracts made without their jurisdiction, between persons residing without their jurisdiction, that Courts can never be justified in putting such a construction on their words if they admit of any other interpretation which is rational and not too much strained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This, it is thought, may be done in the case now to be decided. The words 'which are not residents' refer, it is said, to both parties, Plaintiff and Defendant. They comprehend all the persons previously enumerated. Let this be conceded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then read the exception as if the word 'both' or 'all' were inserted. It will stand thus: 'other than such accounts as concerns the trade or merchandize between merchant and merchant, their factors and servants which are not <i>both</i> or <i>all</i> residents within this province.' The plain meaning of the sentence so read would be that accounts between merchant and merchant either of whom resided out of the province would come within the exception. It is admitted that without the word 'both' or 'all,' the more obvious meaning of the sentence is that for which the Defendant contends. Yet it will bear the same construction without, as with either of those words, and the subject-matter of the law so clearly requires this interpretation that the Court thinks it may be made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rejoinder is founded on the third section of the act which contains the usual exceptions in favor of infants, &amp;c. and allows three years after the removal of the impediment to bring their suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is contended that since the act of limitations runs against a person beyond sea from the time of his coming into the country, so from analogy it ought to run against a non-resident merchant from the time of his coming, though for a mere temporary purpose, within the country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court cannot assent to the correctness of this reasoning. To render it applicable, the rejoinder ought to have averred that the Plaintiff had become a resident of the state of Maryland more than three years before the institution of the suit. Not having done so, the words of the exception have never ceased to be applicable to the Plaintiff; and, consequently, the statute has never commenced to run.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is the opinion of this Court that the Circuit Court erred in overruling the demurrer of the Plaintiff to the rejoinder of the Defendant in this cause, and that the judgment be reversed and annulled, and the cause remanded with instructions to render judgment on the said demurrer in favor of the Plaintiff, and that further proceedings may be had therein according to law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Judgment reversed</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "", "html_with_citations": "<p class=\"case_cite\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></span></p>\n    <p class=\"case_cite\">7 Cranch 350</p>\n    <p class=\"case_cite\">3 L.Ed. 367</p>\n    <p class=\"parties\">BOND AND ANOTHER<br>v.<br>JAY.</p>\n    <p class=\"date\">February 20, 1813</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Absent</i>.
