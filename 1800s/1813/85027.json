Admitting the executory devises over to be good, there could be no doubt as to any part of the estates; for the estates are of a quality different from what he parties would have taken in the course of descent.</p>\n<p>It has been argued by the Plaintiff's counsel, upon the foregoing facts, that as to the whole estate immediately devised to John M`Connell, the lessors of the Plaintiff are entitled to recover, in the events which have happened, as his heirs <i>ex parte materna;</i> and that as to the estate devised to him upon the contingency of the death of John B.

and if the husband or wife be dead, then to his or her kindred in the like course as if such husband or wife had survived the intestate, and then had died entitled to the estate by purchase; and if the intestate has had more husbands or wives than one, and all shall die before such intestate, then the estate shall be equally divided among the kindred of the several husband or wives in equal degree equally.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*467</span> Three classes of cases are here in terms provided for.</p>\n<p>1. \"Estates descended to the intestate on the part of \"the father.\"</p>\n<p>2. \"Estates descended to the intestate on the part of \"the mother.\"</p>\n<p>3. \"Estates vested in the intestate by purchase and \"not derived from or through either of his ancestors.\"</p>\n<p>The descent of an estate of purchase, from brother to brother, and from a son to a parent, where the brother or the parent is the <i>propositus,</i> is not directly within the language of the statute. For, by the common law, a descent from brother to brother is held to be an immediate descent, and not <i>from</i> or <i>through</i> the parents; and the express provision of the statute of Maryland as to estates of purchase, necessarily involves the same conclusion; and the same may be declared of a descent from a child to a parent under the same statute.</p>\n<p>It has been argued that the legislature intended to form a complete scheme of descents; and that the Court ought not to construe any case to be a <i>casus omissus,</i> if by any reasonable construction the words can be extended to embrace it. Both parties accede to this argument, but they apply it in a very different manner. The Plaintiffs contend that the descent from brother to brother was meant to be included in the first and second classes of descents, as the parents were the common link of connexion from and through whom the consanguinity was to be sought; that therefore the descent, in such case, is <i>ex-parte paterna,</i> or <i>materna,</i> as the father or mother happens to be the <i>commune vinculum.</i> And the Plaintiffs rely on the words <i>\"and not derived from or through either of his ancestors,\"</i> in the clause embracing the third class, as distinctly showing that the legislature deemed every case of <i>descents</i> to be completely within the preceding classes. On the other hand, the Defendants contend that whatever might be the legislative supposition, it is impossible to support the position, that a descent from brother to brother, or from child to parent, is a descent <i>ex-parte paterna</i> or <i>materna,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*468</span> It is therefore, either a <i>casus omissus,</i> or the words \"and not derived <i>from</i> or <i>through</i> either of his ancestors\" are to be considered not as qualifying and limiting the preceding words, but as either constituting a fourth class of cases, embracing all such as are not included in the three preceding classes; or as explaining estates by purchase to include all cases which are not paternal or maternal descents.</p>\n<p>There are certainly intrinsic difficulties in admitting either of these constructions. If the legislature have proceeded on a mistake, it would be dangerous to declare that a Court of law were bound to enlarge the natural import of words in order to supply deficiencies occasioned by that mistake. It would be still more dangerous to admit that because the legislature have expressed an intention to form a scheme of descents, the Court were bound to bring every case within the specified classes. In the present case, equal violence would be done to the ordinary use of the terms employed by adopting the construction contended for by either party.</p>\n<p>It is not a descent <i>from</i> or <i>through</i> the paternal or maternal line, in the sense of the common law. Nor is it a <i>purchase.</i></p>\n<p>The words \"<i>and not derived from or through either of his ancestors</i>\" are manifestly used as explanatory of the legal import of purchase. They are the exact words which the common law selects to distinguish the estate of a purchaser from the estate of an heir.</p>\n<p>It is obvious that the legislature use the words <i>descent</i> and <i>purchase</i> in their technical and legal sense. They have also expressly provided for the case of a descent from brother to brother, passing by the parents; and of a parent from a child, when there are no brothers or sisters. These descents must therefore be direct and immediate; and the former case is so deemed also at the common law. It is therefore in our judgment perfectly clear, that a descent from brother to brother is not within the statute, and of course is a <i>casus omissus,</i> to be regulated by the common law.</p>\n<p>To apply this to the present case. By the arrival of John M`Connell at the age of 21 years, all the estates <span class=\"star-pagination\">*469</span> devised to him <i>immediately</i> became absolute estates in fee simple. On his death they passed to his half brother, John B. Hammond; and upon his death they passed to the heirs at law of the latter. The lessors of the Plaintiff have therefore made no sufficient title thereto.</p>\n<p>Let us now consider the second question: whether the lessors of the Plaintiff have any title to the estates which were devised over to John M`Connell upon the contingency of John B. Hammond's dying under age and without issue.</p>\n<p>It has been argued by the Defendant's counsel that this executory devise is void because the contingency is too remote.</p>\n<p>It is the acknowledged rule, that an executory devise is not too remote if the contingency may happen within a life or lives in being, or 21 years and a few months after.</p>\n<p>In the present case the contingency must have happened within 21 years at all events. For if John B. Hammond attained his full age the estate vested absolutely. To have defeated the estate over, it was sufficient either that he attained his full age, or died under age leaving issue. The authorities are conclusive on this point. 1 <i>Wils.</i> 140, 270. 2 <i>Burr</i> 873. 1 <i>Saund.</i> 174. 5 <i>Bos. and Pul.</i> 38. 12 <i>East.</i> 288. 2 <i>Str.</i> 1175. There is no validity therefore in this objection.</p>\n<p>In the next place it will be necessary to consider what is the nature of an executory devise as to its transmissibility to heirs, where the devisee dies before the happening of the contingency.</p>\n<p>And it seems very clear that at common law, contingent remainders and executory devises are transmissible to the heirs of the party to whom they are limited, if he chance to die before the contingency happens. <i>Pollexfen</i> 54. 1 <i>Rep.</i> 99. <i>Cas. Temp. Talb.</i> 117. In such case, however, it does not vest absolutely in the first heir so as upon his death to carry it to his heir at law, who is not heir at law of the first devisee, but it devolves from heir to heir, and vests absolutely in him only who can make himself heir to the first devisee at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*470</span> the time when the contingency happens, and the executory devise falls into possession.</p>\n<p>This rule is adopted in analogy to that rule of descent which requires that a person who claims a fee simple by descent from one who was first purchaser of the reversion or remainder expectant on a freehold estate, must make himself heir of such purchaser at the time when that reversion or remainder falls into possession. <i>Co. Lit.</i> 11. <i>(b.)</i> 14, <i>(a.)</i> 3 <i>Rep.</i> 42. Nor does it vary the legal result that the person to whom the preceding estate is devised, happens to be the heir of the executory devisee, for though on the death of the latter the executory devise devolves upon him, yet it is not merged in the preceding estate, but expects the regular happening of the contingency and then vests absolutely in the then heir of the executory devisee. The case of <i>Goodright v. Searle,</i> 2 <i>Wils.</i> 29, is decisive on this point and indeed runs on all fours with the present.</p>\n<p>But it is contended that the statute of descents of Maryland has changed the rule of the common law in this respect; and has made the death of the intestate the point of time from which the descent and heirship are in every case to be traced. The third section, which is relied on for this purpose, enacts as follows: \"That \"no right in the inheritance shall accrue to or vest in \"any person, other than to children of the intestate \"and their descendants, unless such person is in being, \"and capable in law to take as heir at the time of the \"intestate's death; but any child or descendant of the \"intestate, born after the death of the intestate, shall \"have the same right of inheritance as if born before \"the death of the intestate.\"</p>\n<p>In our judgment, the conclusion drawn from this clause is not correct. The object of the section is to limit the natural <i>capacity</i> to take, as heirs, to persons in being at the time of the death of the intestate, where the estate is then capable of vesting in possession; and not to make persons heirs, who, if in being at the time, would not, by the common law, answer the description of absolute heirs, or to give a vested absolute interest, where the common law had given only a possible contingent interest. The legislature had in view cases of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*471</span> posthumous children, and cases where a descent to an heir had been defeated by the subsequent birth of a nearer heir. The argument of the Defendants, on this point, ought not, therefore, to prevail. No question has been made as to the land specifiedly devised to John B. Hammond in fee with a limitation over to his father in fee. As that limitation over was a good executory devise, and, in the events which happened, took effect, it is very clear that the lessors of the Plaintiff cannot claim title thereto. This is indeed conceded on all sides.</p>\n<p>The result of this opinion accordingly is, that the lessors of the Plaintiff are entitled, as heirs of John M`Connell, at the happening of the contingency, on the death of John B. Hammond, under age and without issue, to one moiety of the Church-hill lands, and the residuary estates as tenants in common with the heirs of John B. Hammond; but they are not entitled to any portion of the lands of which John M`Connell had an absolute vested fee at the time of his decease.</p>\n<p>As, however, a tenant in common cannot in general maintain an action of ejectment against his co-tenant, and there are no facts found in this case to prove an actual ouster and to take it out of the general rule, the consequence is that the judgment, in the opinion of a majority of the Court, must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n</div>",

Nor does it vary the legal result that the person to whom the preceding estate is devised, happens to be the heir of the executory devisee, for though on the death of the latter the executory devise devolves upon him, yet it is not merged in the preceding estate, but expects the regular happening of the contingency and then vests absolutely in the then heir of the executory devisee. The case of <i>Goodright v. Searle,</i> 2 <i>Wils.</i> 29, is decisive on this point and indeed runs on all fours with the present.</p>\n<p>But it is contended that the statute of descents of Maryland has changed the rule of the common law in this respect; and has made the death of the intestate the point of time from which the descent and heirship are in every case to be traced. The third section, which is relied on for this purpose, enacts as follows: \"That \"no right in the inheritance shall accrue to or vest in \"any person, other than to children of the intestate \"and their descendants, unless such person is in being, \"and capable in law to take as heir at the time of the \"intestate's death; but any child or descendant of the \"intestate, born after the death of the intestate, shall \"have the same right of inheritance as if born before \"the death of the intestate.\"</p>\n<p>In our judgment, the conclusion drawn from this clause is not correct. The object of the section is to limit the natural <i>capacity</i> to take, as heirs, to persons in being at the time of the death of the intestate, where the estate is then capable of vesting in possession; and not to make persons heirs, who, if in being at the time, would not, by the common law, answer the description of absolute heirs, or to give a vested absolute interest, where the common law had given only a possible contingent interest. The legislature had in view cases of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*471</span> posthumous children, and cases where a descent to an heir had been defeated by the subsequent birth of a nearer heir. The argument of the Defendants, on this point, ought not, therefore, to prevail. No question has been made as to the land specifiedly devised to John B. Hammond in fee with a limitation over to his father in fee. As that limitation over was a good executory devise, and, in the events which happened, took effect, it is very clear that the lessors of the Plaintiff cannot claim title thereto. This is indeed conceded on all sides.</p>\n<p>The result of this opinion accordingly is, that the lessors of the Plaintiff are entitled, as heirs of John M`Connell, at the happening of the contingency, on the death of John B. Hammond, under age and without issue, to one moiety of the Church-hill lands, and the residuary estates as tenants in common with the heirs of John B. Hammond; but they are not entitled to any portion of the lands of which John M`Connell had an absolute vested fee at the time of his decease.</p>\n<p>As, however, a tenant in common cannot in general maintain an action of ejectment against his co-tenant, and there are no facts found in this case to prove an actual ouster and to take it out of the general rule, the consequence is that the judgment, in the opinion of a majority of the Court, must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n</div>",

Afterwards, his widow, <i>Elizabeth</i>, intermarried with one <i>John Hammond</i>, by whom she had one child only, <i>John Barnitz Hammond</i>, and died on the 22d of April, 1788. After her death, <i>John Hammond</i> intermarried with <i>Elizabeth Anderson</i>, and died on the 7th of April 1805, leaving issue by the last marriage, <i>Jane B.

On the 7th of April, 1794, <i>Catharine Barnitz</i> died seized of the premises, having first duly made her last will and testament. By that will she devised to the said <i>John McConnell</i>, in fee, two certain parcels of land. She then devised another parcel of land, including her mansion-house to the said <i>John Barnitz Hammond</i>, to the intent and uses following, viz. subject, (as to the rents thereof) to certain trusts for the maintenance and education of the said <i>John Barntiz Hammond</i>, and for the payment of certain specific debts of the testatrix, 'to the use of <i>John Hammond</i>, the father, for and during the minority of the said <i>John B.

Hammond</i> shall arrive to the age of 21 years, or the death of the said <i>John Hammond</i>, his father, which shall first happen,' then to the said <i>John B. Hammond</i> in fee. The testatrix then provides, 'and if it should hereafter happen that the said <i>John McConnell</i> should die before he shall arrive to the age of 21 years, and without issue, then I give, devise, and bequeath all the estate of the said <i>John McConnell</i>, which is hereby devised to him, to go immediately to the said <i>John B.

Hammond</i>, their heirs and assigns forever, to be equally divided between them, share and share alike, as tenants in common, and not as joint tenants.' After some intermediate bequests, the testatrix devises 'all the rest, residue, and remainder of her estate, real and personal, to the said <i>John McConnell</i> and <i>John B.

So if the estate had descended from the mother's father directly to the mother's son, it would be an estate which had descended to the son on the part of his mother, and yet it had not descended either from or through his mother, for the <i>estate</i> had never vested in her. The statute must mean every case where the blood must be traced through the mother; every case where the mother is a link of the chain which connects the intestate with the person from whom the estate descended to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This estate, therefore, must be understood, as having descended to <i>J.

The devise to <i>John McConnell</i>, in fee, of the moiety of the church-hill lots, and of the general residuum, vested in him a fee simple estate from the beginning.

Not they who were such at the time of his death, but they who answered the description of his heirs at the time of the death of J. B.

B. Hammond, who took, not by way of descent at common law, but by force of the statute. The preamble of the statute shows that the legislature meant to abolish the law of descents altogether.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The expression 'on the part of the mother,' means, <i>from or through</i> the mother. Now this estate never came to J. B. Hammond from or through his mother. Under the 3d branch of the statute, every estate which comes to an intestate, '<i>and not derived from or through either 'of his ancestors</i>,' is supposed to have come by <i>purchase</i>, and is to descend accordingly. This estate was not derived to the intestate, J. B. Hammond, from or through either of his ancestors, and therefore is to descend <i>as if</i> it came to him by purchase. This construction makes the statute provide for all cases, whereas the construction insisted upon by the Plaintiffs, leaves he cases where the estate has descended or passed by force of the statute from brother to brother of the whole blood, or from son to father, or from husband to wife, or from wife to husband, wholly unprovided for; for these are not cases of purchase, nor of descent from ancestors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, however, the case of Hammond be <i>casus omissus</i>, then the estate may descend at common law through the line of his father.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One argument of the Plaintiff's counsel was built upon the absurdity of supposing that the statute directed an estate to descend <i>to</i> the mother, which had already descended <i>from</i> her. But the statute only directs it to descend to the mother, by way of illustration, so as to lead to the heir.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But if the limitations over were good, then <i>John McConnell</i> died seized of an hereditament, a descendible interest, which went to his heir. Who was his heir? This same J. B. Hammond, so that either way the absolute estate in fee vested in him as a purchaser, and descended to his heirs. Again, the 3d section of the statute declares, 'that no right in the inheritance shall accrue to or vest in any person, unless such person is in being, and capable in law to take <i>as heir</i> at the time of the intestate's death.' Now these Plaintiffs were not 'capable in law to take as heirs' to John McConnell 'at the time of his death.' So that they are prohibited by the statute from taking the benefit of this executory devise, even if they could do so by the common law. Under the statute <i>J. McConnell</i> had, at his death, an inheritable interest in the land devised to J. B. Hammond, with limitation over The statute makes no difference between vested and contingent interests; they all descend alike.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But there is a fatal objection to the Plaintiff's recovery in this case. The lessors of the Plaintiff are tenants in common with the Defendants; and one tenant in common cannot maintain ejectment against another, without proof of <i>actual ouster</i>. Such <i>ouster</i> is not proved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HARPER, <i>in reply</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Defendants have confessed lease, entry and ouster, and therefore, an actual ouster need not be proved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The whole question is as to the meaning of the words 'descend on the part of the mother.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are only two modes of acquiring property, viz. by purchase and by descent; by the act of the party, of by act of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Descents are either lineal or collateral. Lineal is from the ancestor in the direct descending line. Collateral, is where you first ascend to the common ancestor, and then descend until you find the heir.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The construction of the statute adopted by the Defendants, allows only one kind of descent&#8212;lineal. The statute uses the word 'descent' <i>generally</i>, comprehending both kinds. It says <i>from</i> or <i>through</i> either of his ancestors. '<i>From</i>' applies to <i>lineal</i> descent; '<i>through</i>' to <i>collateral</i>. If the statute includes collateral descents, there is an end of the question. If a man takes an estate by reason of his mother, he takes <i>through</i> his mother. If a man takes as great grandson from I. S. the <i>estate</i> has not passed through the father or grandfather, yet he takes through them. So in tracing a collateral descent, the <i>estate</i> does not go through the intermediate links, yet the heir claims through them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the executory devises. The contingency was not too remote nor indefinite. It must be determined within 21 years. If the contingency had been simply <i>dying without issue</i>, there would be weight in the objection; but it is dying <i>under age</i>, and without issue; so that if he came of age, <i>or</i> had issue, the estate became absolute. Here are not two conditions, but two facts making one condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plaintiffs do not take <i>as heirs</i>, but as <i>purchasers</i> under the will by the description of their persons; if they answer the description of heirs at the time the contingency happens on which the executory devise takes effect, they must take. A possibility is not descendible. They take as purchasers. This is an answer also to the objection raised upon the 3d section of the statute. They do not claim <i>as heirs</i>, and therefore are not within the statute. The statute refers to their natural capacity to take.

'shall die intestate thereof, such lands,' &amp;c. 'shall descend to the kindred, male and female, of such person, in the following order, to wit: First, to the child or children, and their descendants, if any, equally, and if no child or descendant, <i>and the estate descended to the intestate on the part of the father</i>, then to the father, and if no father living, then to the brothers and sisters of the intestate of the blood of the father, and their descendants equally, and if no brother or sister as aforesaid, or descendant from such brother or sister, then to the grandfather on the part of the father, and if no such grandfather living, then to the descendants of such grandfather and their descendants, in equal degree equally, and if no descendant of such grandfather, then to the father of such grandfather, and if none such living, then to the descendants of the father of such grandfather in equal degree, and so on, passing to the next lineal male paternal ancestor, and if none such, to his descendants in equal degree, without end: And if no paternal ancestor, or descendant from such ancestor, then to the mother of the intestate, and if no mother living, to her descendants in equal degree equally, and if no mother living, or descendants from such mother, then to the maternal ancestors and their descendants in the same manner as is above directed as to the paternal ancestors and their descendants. <i>And if the estate descended to the intestate on the part of the mother</i>, and the intestate shall die without any child or descendant as aforesaid, then the estate shall go to the mother, and if no mother living, then to the brothers and sisters of the intestate of the blood of the mother, and their descendants in equal degree equally, and if no such brother or sister, or descendant of such brother or sister, then to the grandfather on the part of the mother, and if no such grandfather living, then to his descendants in equal degree equally, and if no such descendant of such grandfather, then to the father of such grandfather, and if none such living, then to his descendants in equal degree, and so on, passing to the next mail maternal ancestor, and if none such living, to his descendants in equal degree, and if no such maternal ancestor, or descendant from any maternal ancestor, then to the father of the intestate, and if no father living, to his descendants in equal degree equally, and if no father living, or descendant from the father, then to the paternal ancestors and their descendants, in the same manner as is above directed as to the maternal ancestors.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'<i>And if the estate is or shall be vested in the intestate by purchase, and not derived from or through either of his ancestors</i>, and there be no child or descendant of such intestate, then the estate shall descend to the brothers and sisters of such intestate of the whole blood, and their descendants in equal degree equally, and if no brother or sister of the whole blood, or descendant from such brother or sister, then to the brothers and sisters of the half blood and their descendants, in equal degree equally, and if no brother or sister of the whole or half blood, or any descendant from such brother or sister, then to the father, and if no father living, then to the mother, and if no mother living, then to the grandfather on the part of the father, and if no such grandfather living, then to the descendants of such grandfather, in equal degree equally, and if no such grandfather, or any descendant from him, then to the grandfather on the part of the mother, and if no such grandfather, then to his descendants in equal degree equally, and so on without end, alternating the next male paternal ancestor and his descendants, and the next male maternal ancestor and his descendants; and giving preference to the paternal ancestor and his descendants; and if there be no descendants or kindred of the intestate as aforesaid to take the estate, then the same shall go to the husband or wife, as the case may be; and if the husband or wife be dead, then to his or her kindred in the like course as if such husband or wife had survived the intestate, and then had died entitled to the estate by purchase; and if the intestate has had more husbands or wives than one, and all shall die before such intestate, then the estate shall be equally divided among the kindred of the several husbands or wives in equal degree equally.' Three classes of cases are here in terms provided for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. ' Estates descended to the intestate on the part of the father.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. 'Estates descended to the intestate on the part of the mother.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. 'Estates vested in the intestate by purchase and not derived from or through either of his ancestors.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The descent of an estate of purchase, from brother to brother, and from a son to a parent, where the brother or the parent is the <i>propositus</i>, is not directly within the language of the statute. For, by the common law, a descent from brother to brother is held to be an immediate descent, and not <i>from</i> or <i>through</i> the parents; and the express provision of the statute of Maryland as to estates of purchase, necessarily involves the same conclusion; and the same may be declared of a descent from a child to a parent under the same statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has been argued that the legislature intended to form a complete scheme of descents; and that the Court ought not to construe any case to be a <i>casus omissus</i>, if by any reasonable construction the words can be extended to embrace it. Both parties accede to this argument, but they apply it in a very different manner. The Plaintiffs contend that the descent from brother to brother was meant to be included in the first and second classes of descents, as the parents were the common link of connexion from and through whom the consanguinity was to be sought; that therefore the descent, in such case, is <i>ex-parte paterna</i>, or <i>materna</i>, as the father or mother happens to be the <i>commune vinculum</i>. And the Plaintiffs rely on the words '<i>and not derived from or through either of his ancestors</i>,' in the clause embracing the third class, as distinctly showing that the legislature deemed every case of <i>descents</i> to be completely within the preceding classes. On the other hand, the Defendants contend that whatever might be the legislative supposition, it is impossible to support the position, that a descent from brother to brother, or from child to parent, is a descent <i>ex-parte paterna</i> or <i>materna</i>. It is therefore, either a <i>casus omissus</i>, or the words 'and not derived <i>from</i> or <i>through</i> either of his ancestors' are to be considered not as qualifying and limiting the preceding words, but as either constituting a fourth class of cases, embracing all such as are not included in the three preceding classes; or as explaining estates by purchase to include all cases which are not paternal or maternal descents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are certainly intrinsic difficulties in admitting either of these constructions. If the legislature have proceeded on a mistake, it would be dangerous to declare that a Court of law were bound to enlarge the natural import of words in order to supply deficiencies occasioned by that mistake. It would be still more dangerous to admit that because the legislature have expressed an intention to form a scheme of descents, the Court were bound to bring every case within the specified classes. In the present case, equal violence would be done to the ordinary use of the terms employed by adopting the construction contended for by either party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not a descent <i>from</i> or <i>through</i> the paternal or maternal line, in the sense of the common law. Nor is it a <i>purchase</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The words '<i>and not derived from or through either of his ancestors</i>' and manifestly used as explanatory of the legal import of purchase. They are the exact words which the common law selects to distinguish the estate of a purchaser from the estate of an heir.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is obvious that the legislature use the words <i>descent</i> and <i>purchase</i> in their technical and legal sense. They have also expressly provided for the case of a descent from brother to brother, passing by the parents; and of a parent from a child, when there are no brothers or sisters. These descents must therefore be direct and immediate; and the former case is so deemed also at the common law. It is therefore in our judgment perfectly clear, that a descent from brother to brother is not within the statute, and of course is a <i>casus omissus</i>, to be regulated by the common law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To apply this to the present case. By the arrival of John McConnell at the age of 21 years, all the estates devised to him <i>immediately</i> became absolute estates in fee simple. On his death they passed to his half brother, John B. Hammond; and upon his death they passed to the heirs at law of the latter. The lessors of the Plaintiff have therefore made no sufficient title thereto.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us now consider the second question: whether the lessors of the Plaintiff have any title to the estates which were devised over to John McConnell upon the contingency of John B. Hammond's dying under age and without issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has been argued by the Defendant's counsel that this executory devise is void because the contingency is too remote.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is the acknowledged rule, that an executory devise is not too remote if the contingency may happen within a life or lives in being, or 24 years and a few months after.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case the contingency must have happened within 21 years at all events. For if John B. Hammond attained his full age the estate vested absolutely. To have defeated the estate over, it was sufficient either that he attained his full age, or died under age leaving issue. The authorities are conclusive on this point. 1 <i>Wils.</i> 140, 270. 2 <i>Burr</i> 873. 1 <i>Saund.</i> 174. 5 <i>Bos. and Pul.</i> 38. 12 <i>East.</i> 288. 2 <i>Str.</i> 1175. There is no validity therefore in this objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the next place it will be necessary to consider what is the nature of an executory devise as to its transmissibility to heirs, where the devisee dies before the happening of the contingency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And it seems very clear that at common law, contingent remainders and executory devises are transmissible to the heirs of the party to whom they are limited, if he chance to die before the contingency happens. <i>Pollexfen</i> 54. 1 <i>Rep.</i> 99. <i>Cas. Temp. Talb.</i> 117. In such case, however, it does not vest absolutely in the first heir so as upon his death to carry it to his heir at law, who is not heir at law of the first devisee, but it devolves from heir to heir, and vests absolutely in him only who can make himself heir to the first devisee at the time when the contingency happens, and the executory devise fails into possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This rule is adopted in analogy to that rule of descent which requires that a person who claims a fee simple by descent from one who was first purchaser of the reversion or remainder expectant on a freehold estate, must make himself heir of such purchaser at the time when that reversion or remainder falls into possession. <i>Co. Lit.</i> 11. <i>(b.)</i> 14, <i>(a.)</i> 3 <i>Rep.</i> 42. Nor does it vary the legal result that the person to whom the preceding estate is devised, happens to be the heir of the executory devisee, for though on the death of the latter the executory devise devolves upon him, yet it is not merged in the preceding estate, but expects the regular happening of the contingency and then vests absolutely in the then heir of the executory devisee. The case of <i>Goodright v. Searle</i>, 2 <i>Wils.</i> 29, is decisive on this point and indeed runs on all fours with the present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But it is contended that the statute of descents of Maryland has changed the rule of the common law in this respect; and has made the death of the intestate the point of time from which the descent and heirship are in every case to be traced. The third section, which is relied on for this purpose, enacts as follows: 'That no right in the inheritance shall accrue to or vest in any person, other than to children of the intestate and their descendants, unless such person is in being, and capable in law to take as heir at the time of the intestate's death; but any child or descendant of the intestate, born after the death of the intestate, shall have the same right of inheritance as if born before the death of the intestate.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our judgment, the conclusion drawn from this clause is not correct. The object of the section is to limit the natural <i>capacity</i> to take, as heirs, to persons in being at the time of the death of the intestate, where the estate is then capable of vesting in possession; and not to make persons heirs, who, if in being at the time, would not, by the common law, answer the description of absolute heirs, or to give a vested absolute interest, where the common law had given only a possible contingent interest. The legislature had in view cases of posthumous children, and cases where a descent to an heir had been defeated by the subsequent birth of a nearer heir. The argument of the Defendants, on this point, ought not, therefore, to prevail. No question has been made as to the land specifiedly devised to John B. Hammond in fee with a limitation over to his father in fee. As that limitation over was a good executory devise, and, in the events which happened, took effect, it is very clear that the lessors of the Plaintiff cannot claim title thereto. This is indeed conceded on all sides.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The result of this opinion accordingly is, that the lessors of the Plaintiff are entitled, as heirs of John McConnell, at the happening of the contingency, on the death of John B. Hammond, under age and without issue, to one moiety of the Church-hill lands, and the residuary estates as tenants in common with the heirs of John B. Hammond; but they are not entitled to any portion of the lands of which John McConnell had an absolute vested fee at the time of his decease.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As, however, a tenant in common cannot in general maintain an action of ejectment against his co-tenant, and there are no facts found in this case to prove an actual ouster and to take it out of the general rule, the consequence is that the judgment, in the opinion of a majority of the Court, must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
