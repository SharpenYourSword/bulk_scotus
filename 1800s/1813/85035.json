It was given in 1795 for part of the purchase money of a large tract of land in Virginia, which Chambers and others contracted to sell and convey to Young. It was afterwards discovered that Chambers and others had been imposed upon, and that they had title only to a very small part of the land they had sold to Young; whereupon a new agreement was entered into on the 6th September, 1798, between Chambers and others and Young, by which the original contract was rescinded and compensation made to Young for the injury he had sustained by their breach of contract, and provision was made to reimburse him the monies he had paid and to take up paper of his, equivalent to that which was then outstanding, and which he had issued for the original purchase money.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Young, in his bill contended, that Chambers and others had not complied with this new agreement, but that they owed him more than enough to cover this note.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the Court below the injunction was dissolved, and upon final hearing the bill was dismissed.
