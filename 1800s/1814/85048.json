This land had been conveyed by Potts to Ludwell Lee in trust to secure the payment of money borrowed of the bank by Potts, <i>but the deed of mortgage had not been recorded within the time limited by the law of Virginia</i>, which governs this case, and which declares that all deeds of mortgage whatsoever, although good between the parties, shall be void as to creditors and subsequent purchasers without notice, unless they be recorded within eight months after their date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SWANN, <i>for the Appellants</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the deed to Lee would be void as to a subsequent purchaser for valuable consideration without notice, yet it is not void as to Herbert, who is the trustee of Potts under the insolvent law for the district of Columbia&#8212;<i>(Laws U.

He takes the estate as the insolvent held it. He is bound by the same equity, and liable to the same obligations. <i>Cooper's B.

The fact that Herbert had notice does not appear; but if it did, he represents the <i>creditors;</i> and their <i>rights</i> are <i>his</i>.

In the case of <i>Taylor v. Wheeler</i>, 2 <i>Vern.</i> 564, it does not appear that the creditors had a right to avail themselves of the defect in the mortgage. If Herbert represents the creditors, the fourth section of the statute of Virginia is conclusive. 1 <i>P. P. Rev. Co.</i> 157. If he does not represent the creditors, then all the provisions of the insolvent law are of no avail. If the deed cannot be set aside by a bill in the name of the trustee, the judgment creditors may file a bill in their own names and set it aside.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SWANN, <i>in reply</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The assignee of a bankrupt also represents the creditors, but yet it has been decided (1 <i>Atk.</i> 94) that although creditors might vacate a deed, yet an assignee could not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case of <i>Taylor v.

The mortgage was void at law for want of a surrender of the copy-hold in due time, yet it was decreed that it should be made good against the assignee of the mortgagor, who, it was admitted, represented the creditors. But the chancellor said that the Complainant also was a creditor, and had trusted to this particular fund, but the others were general creditors; and upon that distinction his decree seems to be founded.
