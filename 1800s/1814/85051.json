Preston was the proprietor at the time of the demand of payment, and has failed to pay. He is therefore within the express letter of the law. 'The <i>defaulter</i>' also is the person who has failed to pay on demand; the person who was liable to pay when the demand was made upon him. Every proprietor of the land is liable for its taxes so long as he is proprietor. The claims, according to the words of the act, are <i>charged upon</i> the real property. They accompany the land into whose hands soever it may pass. The law was intended to give a remedy against any proprietor of the land. The taxes are placed on the same footing as <i>other charges</i> which are liens on the land. It is not a case of greater hardship than that of other liens on real estate. <i>Caveat emptor</i> is the rule where he has the means of knowledge. Here the assessors' books were always accessible. The purchaser is bound to take notice of the non-payment of the taxes. He purchases at his peril.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SWANN, <i>contra</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute uses the definite article, 'THE <i>proprietor</i>.' The question is, <i>which</i> proprietor? Scott or Preston? We say it means him who was proprietor when the tax was laid, and in whose name the land was assessed, and who was <i>unquestionably</i> liable in the first instance. <i>He</i> was 'the proprietor,' 'the defaulter' contemplated by the legislature. If <i>he</i> was liable, did his liability cease when he sold the land? or is he still liable? There is nothing in the law to justify an idea that the legislature contemplated a succession of proprietors who should be successively liable,; a succession of debtors; nor that they should be all liable at once; nor that the corporation should have its choice out of the several successive proprietors. It suggests the idea of <i>one</i> proprietor only, and of one debtor, or defaulter only; and if but one, it can be no other than him who was confessedly liable; him who was proprietor at the time of the assessment. The tax is a lien on the lot so far as to authorize the Court to direct it to be leased out to any one who will pay the taxes, in case the goods and chattels of the debtor cannot be found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The books of the assessor and collector are not matter of record.
