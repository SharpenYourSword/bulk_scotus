To this construction the Court cannot yield assent. The language of the 50th section is, that 'no goods, wares or merchandize, &amp;c. shall be unladen, &amp;c. without a permit;' it is therefore broad enongh to cover all goods, whether lawful or unlawful. The case, being then within the letter, can be extracted from forfeiture only by shewing that it is not within the spirit of the section. To us it seems clear that the case is within the policy and mischief of the collection act, since the necessity of a permit is some check upon unlawful importations, and is one reason why it is required. The act of 1806 does not profess to repeal the 50th section of the collection act as to the prohibited goods, and a repeal by implication ought not to be presumed unless from the repugnance of the provisions the inference be necessary and unavoidable. No such manifest repugnance appears to the court.
