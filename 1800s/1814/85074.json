Auchincloss, of New York, on their account and risk. By the correspondence between the consignor and consignees, which was exhibited to the Court below, under an order for further proof, it is somewhat doubtful whether these goods were to be sold as the property of the consignor, or of the consignees. In the letter from the former to A. Auchincloss, dated the 17th of July, 1812, he says, 'You will lose no time to transmit immediately, on the receipt of the invoice by the Fanny as well as by the Frances, to the full amount of the invoices; as thereby, and no other way, is your credit and John's to be restored here. Also remit, as I have often told you, to clear off your old debt; and, for God's sake, let us have no more failing in the family. You will observe that the goods per Fanny and Frances are principally bought upon a credit of 3, 4 and 5 months&#8212;this the consequence of failing.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In another letter of the same date, from the same to the same, he says, 'By this ship, the Frances, I have shipped you 14 boxes of different kinds of goods, which I beg you will lose no time to dispose, as by early remittances you will undoubtedly strengthen your credit.' In another part of this letter he says, I beg you will lose no time to remit largely, say 3 or 4,000 pounds. Remember the old cash account with the Paisley Banking Company.' These letters, so far as they throw light upon this transaction, intimate very strongly that A. and J. Auchincloss were to dispose of these goods upon their own account, and as the purchasers of them. But to produce a change of property from the shipper to the consignee, it was essentially necessary that the goods should have been sent in consequence of some contract between the parties, by which the one agreed to sell, and the other to buy. Had the language of these letters been more explicit than it is to prove that the intention of the consignor was to vest the right of property in the consignee, it would not have been sufficient to effect such a change, until the goods were received, or some evidence given of the agreement of the consignee to take them on his own account. No order from A. and J. Auchincloss to the consignor of this cargo, authorizing the shipment of it, was produced or offered to be produced in the Court below; and this Court, therefore, is warranted in believing that none such was ever given. Indeed, no interest whatever in these goods is asserted to have existed in A. and J. Auchincloss, but the same is claimed by Wm. French, a citizen of the United States, who, under the order for further proof, produced, in support of his claim, a letter from himself to A. and J. Auchincloss, dated the 20th February, 1812, in which he requests them to order from his friends in Scotland, a quantity of goods enumerated in the letter not to exceed 1,000<i>l.</i> sterling, to be shipped as soon as the orders in council should be revoked, and adding that he should consider the goods at his risk from the time they should be shipped; also an invoice of these goods sent by A. and J. Auchincloss to Wm. French, together with a letter from them, dated the 20th of September, 1812, advising him of the capture of the Frances with the goods shipped on his account, and recommending it to him to take the necessary steps to vindicate his right to the property. This letter made its appearance in the Court below, with the outer leaf, on which the postmark would have been placed, had there been any, torn off. To do away the suspicion which this circumstance might well excite, the affidavit of Darius Hodson was produced, in which he states that he forwarded this letter to the Claimant, at Providence, having first torn off the outer leaf with a view to lessen the rate of postage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit of the Claimant is added, which is fully to the purpose of supporting his interest in these goods, so far as his order to A. and J. Auchincloss can vest such an interest in him. But passing over those observations which might fairly be made upon the mutilated state of the letter from A. and J. Auchincloss to the Claimant, and the suspicious manner in which that circumstance is attempted to be explained, it may be observed that the claim of Wm. French is in no respect stronger than if it had been made by A. and J. Auchincloss. Admit that he wrote to A. and J. Auchincloss the letter of the 20th of February, 1812, and received from them that of the 20th of September, the inquiry still remains to be answered, where is the order for this shipment from A. and J. Auchincloss as the agent of the Claimant?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The truth is, that in whatever light this question is viewed, these goods were at the risk of the shippers until they should be received by the consignee; and, consequently, were, by the capture, made good prize, as property belonging to the enemy.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>12 U.S. 418 (1814)</b></center>\n<center><b>8 Cranch 418</b></center>\n<center><h1>THE FRANCES, BOYER, MASTER.

To establish these claims in point of fact, an order for further proof is asked for, and the question is, whether, if proved, the claim can, in point of law, be sustained?</p>\n<p>The doctrine of <i>liens</i> seems to depend chiefly upon the rules of jurisprudence established in different countries. There is no doubt but that, agreeably to the principles of the common law of England, a factor has a lien upon the goods of his principal in his possession, for the balance of account due to him; and so has a consignee for advances made by him to the consignor. The consignor or owner cannot maintain an action against his factor, to recover the property so placed in his possession, without first paying or tendering what is thus due to the factor. But this doctrine is unknown in prize Courts, unless in very peculiar cases, where the lien is imposed by a general law of the mercantile world, independent of any contract between the parties. Such is the case of freight upon enemies' goods seized in the vessel of a friend, which is always decreed to the owner of the vessel. <i>Abbott on Shipping,</i> 184. It is, to use the words of sir <i>W. Scott,</i> \"an interest directly and \"visibly residing in the substance of the thing itself.\" The possession of the property is actually in the owner of the ship, of which, by the general mercantile law of all nations, he cannot be deprived until the freight due for the carriage of it is paid. He has, in fact, a kind of property in the goods by force of this general law, which a prize Court ought to respect and does respect. On the one hand, the captor, by stepping into the shoes of the enemy owner of the goods, is personally benefited by the labor of a friend, and ought, in justice, to make him the proper compensation: and on the other, the ship owner, by not having carried the goods to the place of their destination, and this, in consequence of an act of the captor, would be totally without remedy to recover his freight against the owner of the goods.</p>\n<p>But in cases of liens created by the mere private contract of individuals, depending upon the different laws of different countries, the difficulties which an examination of such claims would impose upon the captors, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*420</span> even upon the prize Courts, in deciding upon them, and the door which such a doctrine would open to collusion between the enemy owners of the property and neutral Claimants, have excluded such cases from the consideration of those Courts. In the case of the <i>Tobago,</i> 5 <i>Rob.</i> 196, where an attempt was made by a British subject, to set up a bottomry interest on an enemy's ship, sir <i>W. Scott</i> observed, that no precedents to sanction such a claim could be produced: and he very properly concluded, that this was strong evidence that it had not been the practice of the Court to consider such bonds as property entitled to its protection. And it seemed to be conceded, that, upon the same principle, the captor could not entitle himself to the advantage of such liens, existing in an enemy, upon neutral property. From this it appears that the doctrine of the prize Courts upon this subject, works against as well as in favor of captors.

This doctrine would be well founded, if the goods had been sent to the Claimant upon his account and risk, except in the case of insolvency. But when goods are sent upon the account and risk of the shipper, the delivery to the master is a delivery to him as agent of the shipper, not of the consignee; and it is competent to the consignor, at any time before actual delivery to the consignee, to countermand it, and thus to prevent his lien from attaching.
