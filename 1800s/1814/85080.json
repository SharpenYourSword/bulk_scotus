Upon this ground she was by the decree of the district Court ordered to be restored; which decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court. Judge Story's opinion in pronouncing that decree, will be found in the preceding case of the <i>United States v.</i> 1960 <i>bags of coffee</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case having been submitted upon the arguments which were had in that case,</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JOHNSON, <i>J.</i> delivered the opinion of the Court as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'This case depends upon the principle established in the case against the coffee, the Bohlens, Claimants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision, as in that case, was founded upon the ground of a sale to a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser without notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decree of the Circuit Court of Massachusetts district, in this case is therefore reversed, and the Brigantine Mars adjudged forfeited to the United States.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> The case of the United States v. 1960 bags of coffee, ante p. 398.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
