He then offered in evidence the last will and testament of John May, deceased, which contained this clause, 'I give and devise my land to my executors, herein after named, and to the survivors and survive' of such of them as may act, and their heirs, for the purpose of selling as much thereof as will pay all my debts.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This will was proved and admitted to record according to the laws of Virginia, while Kentucky was a part of that state, and is duly certified by the proper authority.

The Court sustained the objection, and the will was not permitted to go in evidence to the jury. To this opinion an exception was taken.

When she did take it upon herself, the condition on which the devise was made, was performed, and she took as devisee under the will; and the act consummating her title, had relation to the time of its commencement, which was before the separation of the two states.
