The orders to the captain were to proceed to New York; but unless he was perfectly sure of being allowed an entrance for ship and cargo at New York, he was not to go into the waters of the United States, but to send up a pilot boat with his letters, so that the consignees might fix upon a port of discharge. The master had no knowledge of the war until his arrival on the coast, when he received it off Montaug point, from a pilot boat, who also informed that several British frigates were off Sandy Hook, capturing American vessels. Whereupon he despatched the pilot boat, with letters for his owners by the way of New London. Soon afterwards it became calm and the ship drifting too near the shore he dropped anchor. In the course of the night it came on to blow a gale, and finding it impossible to lay there he attempted to get under weigh and stand off, but before he could get up the anchor and make sail he drifted so far in that he could not fetch Montaug point, and the pilot informing him that there was good anchorage ground in Fort-pond-bay, and that it would not be safe to keep out, he proceeded with the ship to that bay, intending to stand out as soon as the storm abated. Having there cast anchor and rode out the gale, his crew refused to get underweigh to go out of the waters of the United States, alleging that they understood he had a British license, and was going to put his ship under the protection of British ships of war and they were afraid of being impressed. He then determined to come out into the sound and there wait for orders, without going into any port. He did so, but was boarded about half way from Fort-pond-bay to the race, Fisher's island bearing north, and seized by a revenue cutter, who carried him into New London, where the cargo was libelled for having been shipped in Great Britain with the knowledge of the master, with intent to be imported into the United States, contrary to the provisions of the non-intercourse act of 28<i>th June</i>, 1809, <i>vol.</i> 10, <i>p.</i> 13.
