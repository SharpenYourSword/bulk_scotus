The captured vessel was on her way, under the direction of a prize master and crew, to the port of Salem for adjudication. The indictment laid the offence as committed upon the high seas. The question made was, whether the circuit court has jurisdiction over common law offences against the United States? on which the judges of that court were divided in opinion.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Attorney-General</i> stated that he had given to this case an anxious attention; as much so, he hoped, as his public duty, under whatever view of it, rendered necessary. That he had also examined the opinion of the court, delivered at February term, 1813, in the case of the United States v. Hudson and Goodwin. That considering the point as decided in that case, whether with, or without, argument, on the part of those who had preceded him as the renew sentative of the government in this court, he desired respectfully to state, without saying more, that it was not his intention to argue it now.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">STORY, J.

Whenever counsel can be found ready to argue it, I shall devest myself of all prejudice arising from that case.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LIVINGSTON, J. I am disposed to hear an argument on the point. This case was brought up for that purpose, but until the question is re-argued, the case of the United States v.

Under these circumstances the court would not choose to review their former decision in the case of the United States v. Hudson and Goodwin, or draw it into doubt.
