I, however, rely upon you for the payment of this money, as it was entirely upon your recommendation, upon the strength of your assurances and the respectability of your guaranty, that I was induced to embark in this business, and to procure cotton for the cargo of the ship Mac; but this subject has already been sufficiently enlarged upon in my former letters to you, and I sanguinely trust that you will not delay making the necessary arrangements for this reimbursement. No information has as yet been received by me from Liverpool, respecting the fate of the 500 bales of cotton shipped on board the Mac.

It is our wish to have two hundred bales of good cotton shipped on owners' account, and as much more as may be necessary to make despatch, as we are not willing to have her detained in your port for freight. To reimburse thyself for the cotton purchased on owners' account, thou may draw bills at sixty days sight, either on Jacob Barker or on us.

The mode of reimbursements for purchasers made here will be by drawing on our friend Barker, agreeable to his advice, as I think it will be less difficult for me to place bills on New-York. Cotton is rising, and fetches now 26 cents. Notwithstanding, I shall follow your orders with respect to the Mac, unless any thing to the contrary should reach me before she arrives. As for drawing on Liverpool, it is altogether out of my power, for such bills are seldom asked for here. I shall advise Messrs.

By last mail we received a letter from Mr. Jacob Barker, informing that he feared the contractors would not furnish the eight hundred bales, and that in consequence thereof the Mac would be detained until further orders from us.

Shaw, of the firm of Corp, Ellis &amp; Shaw, Merchants, residing in this city, about the charter of a ship, mentioned to said Shaw, that he, Barker, had just returned from Portland, where he had been for the purpose of getting security from John Taber &amp; Son, when he, said Shaw, informed him that they had, a few days previously, sent bills drawn at New-Orleans on said Taber and Son, under cover to the said Tabers, for acceptance, to the amount of ten thousand dollars; and inquired if he, this defendant, supposed they would, in the deranged state of their business, return them regularly protested or accepted? From this <i>defendant's knowledge of said Taber's business he believed</i> that those bills were drawn in payment for the ship Mac's cargo; this being the only information this defendant had of any bills being drawn at New-Orleans on said John Taber &amp; Son, he was induced to accompany the said Gabriel Shaw to his office, to ascertain the particulars; who, at the instance of this defendant, exhibited to him either a letter or one of the same sets of bills by which this defendant learnt they were drawn by Paul Lanusse, at New-Orleans, on John Taber and Son, Portland, in part payment for the cargo of the Mac. That this defendant, acting from the information so received, and from no other in formation or advice whatever, and, also, from an apprehension that the said complainant, when he should hear of the failure of the said house of John Taber &amp; Son, would claim from this defendant the amount for which the said bill or bills were drawn, and thereby expose this defendant to an expensive course of litigation in resisting the said plaim, if any should be made, he, this defendant, wrote to the said John Taber &amp; Son a letter on the srbject of the said bill or bills, and which letter, he believes, is as follows, to wit:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>New-York</i>, 5 <i>mo.</i> 5<i>th</i>, 1807.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>John Taber &amp; Son</i>,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I am this day advised of Paul Lanusse's having drawn on you to the amount of ten thousand dollars, which bills were forwarded to you for acceptance: for the payment of those drafts I am not liable, as I only promised to accept in case of his drawing on me. You undoubtedly, accepted those bills; if not, and you have them, be pleased at all events, to accept them, as if they are returned without acceptance, the charge will be, as at first, for the shipment for which Lanusse may possibly think me answerable, but if the bills are accepted, he can only look to you. The debt, as to him, thereby becomes of another nature, but as to you it is the same thing, and cannot place you in any worse situation. Therefore, let them be accepted, and if you have returned them without acceptance, authorise me to accept them as your agent to this business; give immediate attention as I must not he made answerable for them; although injured,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I am yet your friend,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JACOB BARKER.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And that afterwards this defendant wrote another letter to the said John Taber &amp; Son, which he believes is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>New-York</i>, 5<i>mo.</i> 15, 1807.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>John Taber</i>,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This day's mail brought me thy letter, by which I am surprised to observe thee has refused compliance with my request. I cannot account for the strange advice your merchants gave respecting protesting those bills. I, however, admit that in ordinary cases there would not be much impropriety in protesting them, though I could not possibly alter the state of your business, the debt being indisputable, their being accepted only acknowledged the debt to be due; but I must insist if thee has any regard to justice, that thee will, if not returned, accept them for account of John Taber &amp; Son; if returned, authorise me to accept them for their account. I consider the argument that I expected to secure the Mac and cargo, no excuse at all, particularly as no attachment can be made in this state for partial benefit, all attachments must be made for the benefit of all the creditors. So that if I have property in my hands, the best possible step the creditors could take would be for one of them to attach it in my hands: therefore, must pointedly insist on thy accepting, or ordering me to accept those bills. As to advice from thy neighbours, it is one of those simple cases that do not require advice, and I say expressly, when thee considers my situation, thee cannot honestly refuse my request. If I was in thy situation, and all the world advised me not to do it, I should not pay the least respect to such advice, but accept the bills without a moment's hesitation. If thou thinks Paul Lanusse will be a more difficult creditor than I shall be, thee will, under present circumstances, be mistaken, to where I am thus forced into a monstrous loss, I shall be very difficult, although, in common cases, should be favourably disposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Your friend,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JACOB BARKER.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff further proved by Joseph Thebaud, of New-York, the plaintiff's agent, that in the beginning of October, 1807, he received from the plaintiff the following account, dated 1st September, 1807, at New-Orleans, which he showed to the defendant, and demanded payment of the same, which was refused by the defendant:<i>   Dr. Mr. Jacob Barker of New York, for account of Messrs.

The bills were accompanied with a letter of advice, mentioning that the first bill was for the balance due for the purchase of the 500 bales of cotton, and the other for disbursements of the ship Mac, and 1500 dollars damages paid on the two drafts of 5000 each on Taber &amp; Son, returned protested for non-payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff further proved, that all the bills of exchange drawn by plaintiff on the defendant, and contained in the above account, amounting to 23,042 dollars 96 cents had been paid by the defendant after the same had been protested for non-payment, excepting the last mentioned bills for 5,000 dollars each, drawn in favour of Thomas Elmes, and forwarded as aforesaid to Corp, Ellis &amp; Shaw.

That the said bills at maturity were protested in New-York, for non-payment, and were afterwards remitted to the said Thomas Elmes at New-Orleans.

The defendant insisted that the plaintiff was not entitled to any damages; and the judge so charged the jury, <i>pro forma</i>. A verdict was thereupon taken for the defendant, and a bill of exceptions tendered. An agreement was entered into by the counsel for both parties, that the cause should be carried to the supreme court by writ of error, and that if the supreme court should be of opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to a judgment for the principal sum of 11,251 dollars and 19 cents with interest, at the rate of 10 per cent., then the judgment should be rendered for the sum of 17,908 dollars and 2 cents, with costs. Or if the court should be of opinion that he was entitled to interest at the rate of seven per cent. only that judgment should be rendered for the sum of 15,910 dollars and 94 cents with costs: or if the court should be of opinion that any other sum different from either of the above sums, is recoverable by the plaintiff, that judgment should be rendered for such other sum as the court might direct.

That the original undertaking of the defendant was a guaranty that all bills drawn by the plaintiff, on account of the ship Mac, should be paid whether drawn on the defendant or on Taber &amp; Son. The learned counsel entered into a critical analysis of the opinion of the supreme court of the state of New-York in this cause,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fna\" id=\"fna_ref\">a</a> and contended that the rules for construing contracts extend to all parties alike, whether sureties or principals: That they must be construed according to the intention of the parties, not according to the mere literal meaning of the words. If these are ambiguous, the intention must be ascertained by the context, by contemporaneous declarations, writings, and transactions, and, above all, by the purposes and objects to be answered. This principle is applicable to the undertaking of a surety.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fnb\" id=\"fnb_ref\">b</a> It is by no means a well established rule that the</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fna\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fna_ref\">a</a>\n        <p class=\"indent\"> 10 <i>Johns R.</i> 325.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fnb\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fnb_ref\">b</a>\n        <p class=\"indent\"> Barclay <i>et al.</i> v.

Note <i>a</i>. contract of a surety is to be construed more favourably than that of the principal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fnc\" id=\"fnc_ref\">c</a> The law knows no favourites. The obligation of the surety is the inducement for the creditor to trust the principal, with whose affairs and circumstances the surety is presumed to be best acquainted. Formerly, nothing could discharge this liability at law, but performance, if the creditor had discharged the principal, or extended the time of payment by a new contract with the principal, without the surety's consent, the surety had no remedy. In later times, the courts of law have interposed to protect the surety; but there is much contrariety in the numerous cases that have been decided, upon the question what transactions between the creditor and the principal shall discharge the surety. There is no doubt that an absolute discharge of the principal will discharge the surety also. But it is contended that no new contract or transaction between the creditor and principal shall discharge the surety, unless it deprive him of the right he always possesses of placing himself in the creditor's situation by paying the debt according to the original contract, and thus getting into his own hands the means of securing himself. This principle is founded on the nature of the contract of suretyship, and is supported by the authorities, except one or two cases, which it will be difficult to reconcile with principle.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fnd\" id=\"fnd_ref\">d</a> All the cases decided in England in favour of sureties have been where the creditor has taken away this right by discharging the principal, or by</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fnc\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fnc_ref\">c</a>\n        <p class=\"indent\"> Mason v.

That by the well established doctrine of law and equity, a different rule was to be applied, in the construction of the contract of the surety, from that which was applicable to the contract of the principal. In regard to the principal, a liberal interpretation is to be indulged, to reach the substance and equity of the contract; whilst the undertaking of the surety is to be limited to its precise terms. The reasons of this distinction are, that there is a valuable consideration moving from the creditor, which creates an equitable obligation, on the part of the principal, independent of the express contract, whilst, in respect to the surety, there is nothing but his express promise, <i>acceding</i> to that of the principal</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fne\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fne_ref\">e</a>\n        <p class=\"indent\"> Nesbitt v.

Another reason is one of legal policy, to encourage suretyships for the benefit of commerce, and the extension of credit, and at the same time to protect. the sureties by every means the same time to protect, All the cases at law are consonant with this distinction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fng\" id=\"fng_ref\">g</a> The aid of the courts of equity has been invoked in vain to effect a more enlarged construction of the undertaking of sureties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fnh\" id=\"fnh_ref\">h</a> Besides, whatever was the undertaking of the defendant in the present case, the plaintiff considered the order contained in the letter of the 9th of January as completely abrogated by the letter of the 13th of February, after which date the principals step in, and the plaintiff acts under their orders, and corresponds with them only. By the last mentioned letter, the defendant promises to answer bills drawn on himself only, which was a new undertaking, on his part, under which he could not be liable for bills drawn on Taber &amp; Son. Nor did the plaintiff give the defendant any notice of those bills being drawn, which omission would alone be sufficient to discharge him from his liability.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. <i>D. B. Ogden</i>, in reply, insisted, that though the surety could not be made responsible beyond the tenor of his engagement, he could not be discharged by implication, still less by studied ambiguity of language and artifice of conduct. That the great fundamental principle, in the interpretation of contracts, is to carry into effect the intention of the parties, and that this principle was peculiarly applicable to commercial contracts. That where there is a doubt arising from the ambiguity of expressions, the acts of the parties may be resorted to as supplementary evidence of their intention. That even supposing their had been a revocation, or modification of the original contract, on the part of the defendant, he is still liable under his subsequent undertaking. No case can be found, where a mere attempt to recover of the principal will discharge the surety. All the authorities are the other way. The drawing the bills on Taber &amp; Son was not a waiver of the defendant's liability. Nor was any notice to the defendant necessary, any more than on a bill of exchange, where the want of funds in the drawee's hands dispenses with the necessity of notice. So, in this case, the defendant having no funds in the hands of Taber &amp; Son, notice to him would not have enabled him to get into his own hands the means of securing himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p>Feb. 17th.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice JOHNSON delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case comes up on a bill of exceptions. This charge of the Judge was given <i>pro forma</i>, generally against the plaintiff, and the verdict conforms to it. There are many counts in the declaration, and if, on any of those counts the plaintiff was entitled to recovor, the judgment below must be reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first count is on a refusal to pay two sets of bills drawn on Taber &amp; Son of Portland, payable in New-York. These bills were duly protested and returned, and the amount, with damages, refunded by the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In defence to this count it is contended: That the undertaking of Barker, as expressed in his letter of the 9th of January, 1806, relates to a different transaction from that upon which this cotton was purchased; that this transaction originated in the letters of the 26th of January, or 24th of July, 1806, or of the 20th February, 1807, and in neither of those letters is the undertaking, on bills to be drawn on Taber &amp; Son, reiterated: That the letters alluded to contain, in fact, an implied revocation of the undertaking in the letter of the 9th, of which the plaintiff was bound to take notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the correctness of these positions, this court cannot yield its assent. Nothing could be more inconsistent with that candour and good faith which ought to mark the transactions of mercantile men, than to favour the revocation of an explicit contract on the construction of a correspondence no where avowing that object. It was in the defendant's power to have revoked his assumption, contained in the letter of the 9th, at any time prior to its execution, but it was incumbent on him to have done so avowedly, and in language that could not be charged with equivocation. In this case, we discover nothing from which such an intention can fairly be inferred. The whole correspondence refers to the same subject, and has in view the same object. The expediting of the ship Mac on freight, if freight could be obtained, and if not, to be filled up, (at least to the quantity of cotton here purchased,) on owner's account. This agency the plaintiff undertakes expressly on the credit of Barker, for a house, with whose credit, except on his introduction, he is unaquainted: and so far from restricting the order contained in the letter of the 9th, there is not one from the defendant, in the subsequent correspondence, that does not enlarge the order as to quantity, upon the contingency of the ship not getting freight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, it is contended, although the original assumption may not have been revoked, it was not complied with, according to the terms in which it was expressed, and, therefore, was not binding to the defendant. And on this ground, so far as relates to the bills in this count, the court is of opinion, that the defence is supported on legal principles. The assumption is to guaranty bills, 'drawn on Taber &amp; Son, Portland, or me, at 60 days sight.' These bills are drawn on Taber &amp; Son, Portland, payable in New-York. Now, although we cannot see why an honourable discharge of his contract did not prompt the defendant to accept these bills for the honour of the drawer, when they were returned to New-York for non-acceptance, yet, as it is our duty to construe the contracts of individuals, and not to make them, we are of opinion, that these bills were not drawn in conformity to the assumption of the defendant. Merchants well understand the difference between drawing bills upon a specified place, and drawing them upon one place payable in another. We are not to inquire into the reasons which govern them in forming such contracts, or competent to judge, whether any other mode of complying with a contract may not be as convenient to them, as that which they have consented to be governed by. But it will be perceived, that this opinion can only effect the right of the plaintiff to recover the damages paid by him on the return of those bills, and has no effect, in this view of the case, upon the plaintiff's right to recover, upon the original guaranty of this debt, when legally demanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is, however, contended, that the election to draw in this form, was conclusive upon the plaintiff, and he could not afterwards resort to a draft upon the defendant himself. And this brings up the question upon the plaintiff's right to recover upon the second count. This count is on a refusal to pay a bill drawn on Barker himself, for the exact balance of the invoice of the cotton, after crediting the defendant with the bills that he had paid. This bill was not negotiated and returned, but drawn in favour of an agent of the plaintiff, and of course no damages are demanded on it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defence set up to this count, to wit, that the plaintiff, by making his election to draw upon Taber and Son, is thereby precluded from restoring to Barker, we think cannot be sustained. It is in vain that we look for any passage in the correspondence that holds out this idea, nor is there any thing in the nature of the transaction that will sanction this court in attaching such a restriction to Barker's undertaking. It was in effect a promise to furnish the funds necessary to carry into execution this adventure. Had it contained a mere guaranty of bills to be drawn on Taber &amp; Sons, there might have been some ground for this argument; but where the defendant confers the right to draw upon himself, and, in fact, clearly recommends a preference to such bills, he makes himself the paymaster, and we consider it an original substantive undertaking. In this view of the case, the law quoted on the subject of securityship undertakings cannot be applicable, and we think the plaintiff ought to recover on this count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are other items in the plaintiff's demand, on which, as the case will be sent back, it is necessary to express an opinion. The first is the charge of about 1200 dollars for services and expenses incident to this agency; the other is the charge of interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first of these items we are clearly of opinion the plaintiff is entitled to, and that it is recoverable under the counts for services performed, and money expended in the discharge of this undertaking. And as to the second, we are equally satisfied that interest is recoverable under the second count in nature of damages. But some difficulty has arisen on the question whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover the interest of New-Orleans or of New-York. The former, the bill of exceptions states to be ten per cent.: the latter seven per cent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a general authority is given to draw bills from a certain place, on account of advances there made, the undertaking is to replace the money at that place. Had this bill on Barker been negotiated and returned under protest, the holder would have been entitled to demand of the drawer the interest of New-Orleans, and thus incidentally at least, the defendant would have been compelled to pay the plaintiff that interest. But it may be contended that as the letter of the 26th appears to restrict the order for this purchase, so as to make it depend on the condition of the practicability of negotiating bills on New-York, the undertaking of Barker was limited to payments to be made in New-York. On this point the court are of opinion that, even though we attach this condition to Barker's undertaking, the liability to replace the money at New-Orleans still continued; and any necessary loss on the bills on account of the difference of exchange, would have been chargeable to the defendant; but we think, farther, that the restrictive words in the letter alluded to may justly be considered as enlarged into a general order in his subsequent correspondence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court is therefore of opinion, that as the money was advanced at New-Orleans, and to be replaced at New-Orleans, the plaintiff may claim the legal interest at that place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court is of opinion that there is error in the judgment below, and that it must be reversed. But this court can do no more than order a <i>venire facias de novo</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An attempt has been made to obtain from this court a mandate to the circuit court, to enter a judgment in conformity to an agreement of parties entered on the transcript, which states the amount to be adjudged to the plaintiff, upon several alternatives. But we are of opinion that this court can take no notice of that consent. The verdict presents no alternative: and the consent entered on the transcript or on the minutes of the circuit court, forms no part of the record brought up by this writ of error. Nor will this court be led into the exercise of a power so nearly approaching the province of a jury in assessing damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment reversed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fni\" id=\"fni_ref\">i</a> <i>objection to guaranty you against any loss, from giving them this credit</i>;' it was held that the writing did not import a perfect and conclusive guaranty, but only a proposition or overture tending to a guaranty; and that to make it a guaranty, B. ought to have had notice, that it was so regarded and meant to be accepted or there should have been a subsequent consent on his part to convert it into a conclusive guaranty. M'Iver v. Richardson 1 <i>Maule and Selwyn</i>, 557. But it is said that the words are to be taken as strongly against the party giving the guaranty, as the sense of them will admit of. Therefore, where the defendant wrote the plaintiff, 'I hereby promise to be responsible to T. M. [the plaintiff,] for <i>any goods</i> he <i>hath</i> or <i>may</i> supply my brother W. P. to the amount of 100<i>l</i>,' it was held that this was a standing or contiuing guaranty to the extent of 100<i>l.</i>, which might at any time become due for goods supplied, until the credit was recalled. At the time the letter was written, goods had been supplied to the amount of 66<i>l.</i>, and afterwards, another parcel was delivered, amounting together with the former to 124<i>l.</i>, all which had been paid for, and the sum now in dispute, (and which by the judgment of the court, the plaintiff recovered,) was for a farther supply to W. P. Mason v. Prichard, 2 <i>Camp. N. P.</i> 436. S. C. 12 <i>East.</i> 227. So, where the defendant wrote to the plaintiff, 'I have been applied to by my brother, W. W. to be bound to you for any debts he may contract, not to exceed 100<i>l.</i> (with you,) for goods necessary in his business as a jeweller; I have wrote to say by this declaration, I consider myself bound [to you for any debt he may contract for his business as a jeweller, not exceeding 100<i>l.</i> after this date.' Lord Ellenborough said, that the defendant was answerable for any debt not exceeding 100<i>l.</i>, which W. W. might <i>from time to time</i> contract with the plaintiff in the way of business; that the guaranty was not confined to one instance, but applied to debts successively renewed; and that if a party meant to be a surety only for a single dealing, he should say so. Merle v. Wells, 2 <i>Camp. N. P. R.</i> 413. So, where the defendant wrote, 'I hereby undertake and engage to be answerable to the extent of 300<i>l.</i> for any tallow or soap supplied by Mr. B. [the plaintiff] to F. &amp; B., provided they shall neglect to pay in due time;' Lord Ellenborough held it to be a continuing guaranty while the parties continued to deal on the footing established when it was given; but that goods supplied after new arrangements were made, were not within the scope of the guaranty; and he relied on the word '<i>any</i>,' without which he thought it might perhaps be confined to one dealing to the amount of 300<i>l.</i> Baston v. Bennett, 3 <i>Camp. N. P.</i> 220. But in debt on a bond entered into by A. and B. with the plaintiffs, reciting, that it was to enable A. to carry on his trade, and conditioned for the payment of all such sum or sums of money not exceeding 3000<i>l.</i> with lawful interest, which should or might at any time or times thereafter be advanced, and lent by the plaintiffs to A. or paid to his use, by his order and direction,' it was held, that it was a guaranty for the definite amount of 3000<i>l.</i>, and when an advance was made to that amount, the guaranty became <i>functus officio</i>, and was not a continuing guaranty, Kirby v. Duke of Marlborough 2 <i>Maule and Selwyn</i>, 18. And, where the defendants wrote to the plaintiff 'If W. &amp; B., our sons, wish to take goods of you on credit, we are willing to lend our names as security for any amount they may wish,' the court held, that it was not a continuing guaranty, but was confined to the first parcel of goods sold to W. &amp; B.; that it gave an unlimited credit as to <i>amount</i>, but was silent as to the continuance of the credit to future sales, and <i>expressio unius, est exclusio alterius</i>. Rogers v. Warner, 8 <i>Johns. Rep</i> 119. and in a very recent case, where the defendants wrote to the plaintiff, 'our friends and connexions S. &amp; H. H. contemplate under certain circumstances, making a considerable purchase of goods on the continent, and for that purpose, are about to send an agent to Europe. They wished a letter of credit from us to increase their means, and to be used or not as circumstances may require. As we are now indebted to you, and have no funds on the continent of Europe, we told them we could not give a positive letter of credit for any sum, but that we had no doubt you would be disposed to furnish them with funds under our guaranty. The object of the present letter, is therefore, to request you, if convenient, to furnish them with any sum they may want, as far as $50,000, say 50,000 dollars. They will reimburse you the amount they receive, together with interest, as soon as arrangements can be made to do it. We shall hold ourselves answerable to you for the amount;' it was held, that was a guaranty for a single advance to the amount of 50,000 dollars, and not a continuing guaranty, <i>toties quoties</i>, to that amount, and that as soon as 50,000 dollars were once advanced, the guaranty ceased to operate upon future advances, although by intermediate payments the sum due at the time of such new advances, were below 50,000 dollars.

Philips v. Astling, 2 <i>Taunt. Rep.</i> 206. But upon such a guaranty (if it is to be construed as limiting the bill to the specific sum of 500<i>l.</i>) the guarantee would not be liable to the extent even of the 500<i>l.</i> if the bill be drawn for a larger sum; for the terms of the contract must be strictly complied with. <i>Ib.</i> And a guaranty to A. for goods to be sold by him on credit to B. will not enure to the benefit of a third person, who shall actually furnish the goods to B. although at the request of A., for a surety is not to be held beyond the scope of his own engagement. Robbins v. Bingham, 4 <i>Johns. Rep.</i> 476. Walsh v. Bailie, 10 <i>Johns. Rep.</i> 180. And see 1 <i>Maule &amp; Selw</i>, 557. So if a letter of credit be addressed to A., and part of the goods are delivered by A., and part by C. and D., the latter cannot recover on the guaranty. Robbins v. Bingham, 4 <i>Johns. Rep.</i> 476. So, a letter of guaranty, addressed to J. &amp; A. N. by mistake, for J. &amp; J. N. will not cover advances made by the latter on the faith of the letter. Grant v. Naylor, 4 <i>Cranch</i>, 224. Many cases analogous to this have been decided. As where A. became surety by bond that B. should truly account to C. for all sums of money received by B. for C.'s use, and afterwards B. took a partner with C.'s knowledge, it was ruled that the guaranty and not extend to sums received by B. and his partner, for C.'s use, after the formation of the partnership. Bellairs v. Elsworth, 3 <i>Camp. N. P.</i> 53. So a bond conditioned to repay all sums advanced by <i>five</i> persons, or any of them, was held not to extend to sums advanced after the decease of one of them by the four survivors, the four then acting as bankers.

But if a bond be given to trustees conditioned for the faithful service of a person during his continuance in the service of a fluctuating or successive body of persons, not incorporated, as the Globe Insurance Company, it will extend to the whole time the party is in the service of such company, although the members may be continually changing. Metcalf v. Bruin, 12 <i>East.</i> 400. An agent in England for merchants the vendors of goods in Russia who guaranties 'that the shipment shall be in conformity with the revenue laws of Great Britain, so that no impediment shall arise upon the importation thereof, or that in default the consequences shall rest with the sellers,' makes himself personally responsible to the vendee.

In Oxley v. Young, 2 <i>H. Bl.</i> 613, where the defendant, upon an undertaking of D. to indemnify him, guarantied to the plaintiff an order sent to him by A. for certain goods, and the plaintiff informed the defendant that the goods were preparing, but did not give him notice of the actual shipment, the court thought that the right to sue on the guaranty attached when the order was put in a train for execution, subject to its being actually executed; and that the notice of such intended execution was sufficient; and the court farther thought, that that right could not be devested even by a wilful neglect of the plaintiff, though, perhaps, he might be liable to an action on the case at the suit of the defendant, if any such neglect could be shown contrary to all good faith, and by which a loss had been incurred. In Peel v. Tutlock, 1 <i>Bos. &amp; Pull.</i> 419. Chief Justice Eyre appears to have been of opinion, that at least in guaranties for good behaviour, notice of any embezzlement or fraud ought to be given within a reasonable time; but the case finally went off upon narrower grounds. In Russell v. Clarke, 7 <i>Cranch</i>, 69. 92. it was distinctly held by the court, that if the contract in that case had been a guaranty, it would certainly have been the duty of the plaintiff to have given immediate notice to the defendant of the extent of his engagement. And the same doctrine was ascerted in the circuit court, in Cremer v. Higginson, already cited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where there is a guaranty of advances or supplies, it is necessary in the first instance to make a demand of payment from the original debtor, or at least to use reasonable diligence in endeavoring to make such a demand, and notice of nonpayment must be given in a reasonable time to the guarantee. This may be collected as the general result of the cases on this subject. But where an agent in England, for merchants the vendors of goods in Russia, who guarantees 'that the shipment shall be in conformity with the revenue laws of Great Britain, so that no impediment shall arise upon the importation thereof, or that in default the consequence shall rest with the sellers,' it was held that the agent made himself personally responsible to the vendee, and that in a declaration upon such a guarantee against the agent, it is unnecessary to allege any application for indemnity to the principals. Readhead <i>et al.</i> v. Cator, 1 <i>Starkie's N. P. R.</i> 14. And it is not necessary to sue the debtor, before the right attaches to sue on the guaranty. Bank of New-York v. Livingston, 2 <i>Johns. Cas.</i> 409. And where the guaranty is of a note or bill payable at future time, although it is not necessary to pursue the same strictness in order to charge a guarantee as to charge the drawer; yet a due demand and notice of non-payment ought to be given to the drawer and guarantee; and if the necessary steps are not taken to obtain payment from the parties who are liable on the bill, <i>and solvent</i>, the guarantee is discharged. Phillips v. Astling, 2 <i>Taun.</i> 206. Warrington v. Furber, 8 <i>East.</i> 245. But it is a sufficient excuse for not making a demand, that the debtor cannot be found or that he is insolvent. Warrington v. Furber, 8 <i>East</i>, 245. Phillips v. Astling, 2 <i>Taunt.</i> 206. And if there be gross laches in securing the debt. (Duval v. Trask, 13 <i>Mass. R.</i> 154. The People v. Jansen, 7 <i>Johns. R</i>, 332, Hunt v. United States, 1 <i>Gallis</i>, 34.) or if the creditor undertake to do any thing whereby to lessen or postpone the responsibility of the debtor; (Commissioners of Berks v. Ross, <i>Binney</i>, 520,) or if the right of the parties be altered, as if any new debt have been incurred; or if the demand have been enlarged to the prejudice of the guarantee; (Peel v. Tatlock, 1 <i>Bos. &amp; Pul.</i> 419, King v. Baldwin, 2 <i>Johns. Chan. R.</i> 554. Boultbee v. Stubbs. 18 <i>Ves.</i> 20.) or if the creditor give time to his debtor without the knowledge of the guarantee; (Skip v. Huey, 3 <i>Alk.</i> 91, 6 <i>Ves.</i> 809. note <i>a</i>. Rees v. Berrington, 2 <i>Ves. Jun.</i> 540. Nisbit v. Smith, 2 <i>Bro. Ch. Cas.</i> 579. Moore v. Bowmaker, 6 <i>Taunt.</i> 379. S. C. 2 <i>Marshall's R.</i> 81.) or if upon a guaranty of a partnership debt, the partnership debt is discharged by carrying the proportions of each partner to his separate account without any notice to the guarantee; (Cremer v. Higgonson, MSS. above cited;) or if there be a fraudulent concealment to the injury of the guarantee; (Oxley v. Young, 2 <i>H. Bl.</i> 613, Semble, Eyre, C. J.) in all these cases the guarantee is discharged. And it has been held in a recent case, that if the holder of a note is requested by the surety, (being one of the joint makers.) to proceed without delay and collect the money of the principal, who is solvent, and he omits to do it, until the principal becomes insolvent, the surety will be exonerated at law. (Paine v. Packard, 13 <i>Johns. R.</i> 174,) But this decision has been questioned by very high authority. (King v. Baldwin, 2 <i>Johns. Chan. R.</i> 563, 564.) Where there are several debts due, some of which are guartied and some not, and payments are made by one debtor, the same general rule applies in this as in other cases, that where the debtor makes no application of any payment, the creditor may apply it to any account he pleases. (Kirby v. Duke of Marlborough, 2 <i>Maule &amp; Selw.</i> 18. Dawson v. Remnant, 6 <i>Esp. R.</i> 26. Field v. Holland, 6 <i>Cranch.</i> 8. Hutchinson v. Bell, 1 <i>Taunt.</i> 558. Sturges v.

Among other things; he remarks, that care should be taken not to take for a promise to become surety, what one says or writes, unless there be a well-marked intention to do <i>so</i>. Therefore, he adds, if I wrote or said to you, that a man who asked you to lend you money, was solvent, this could not be taken for an agreement to become a surety for I might well have no other intention than to inform you of what I believed to be the case and not to bind myself. On this principle it was adjudged in a case reported in Papon X. 4. 12. that these words in a letter to the keeper of a boarding-house, 'A. B. intends to send his son to board with you. He is an honest man and will pay you well,' did not include an obligation. On the same principle, if I accompany a person to a woolen-draper's, where he buys cloth, the draper ought not to conclude that I am security for him. The following distinctions and principles stated by this learned writer, seem worthy of notice, in reference to the subject of this note. 1. Where the surety has expressed the sum and cause for which he became surety, his obligation does not extend beyond the sum and cause expressed. As if one become bound for the principal debt, he will not be liable for interest. 2. On the other hand, when the words of the suretyship are general and indeterminate, the surety is presumed to have bound himself for all the obligations of the debtor resulting from the contract to which he acceded; and, therefore, a surety in generel terms, is bound not only for the principal sum, but for interest; and not only for the interest due <i>ex rei natura</i>, but for that occasioned by the delay of the debtor. And this is conformable to the doctrine of the Roman law, 3. And, in general, however unlimited the suretyship may be, it does not extend to the penalties to which the debtor may be condemned, <i>officio judices propter suam contumaciam</i>, 4. The obligation of suretyship is extinguished by an extinction of the principal debt; by the creditor's disabling himself by his own act from ceding his action against his principal debtor, which the surety has an interest in having assigned to him; by the creditor's accepting in payment property, the title to which afterwards proves to be invalid, at least if the principal debtor in the meantime becomes insolvent. 5. And the principal debt may be extinguished not only by payment or a set off or release, but also by a novation of the debt, that is, by accepting a new obligation in discharge of the old one. 6. Pothier then puts the case, whether the surety be discharged by the creditor's granting to the debtor a delay for the payment, and agrees with Vinnius in holding the negative, for he says, the simple delay, not making the debt appear discharged, deprives the surety of no means of providing for his own safety and the surety cannot pretend that the delay prejudices him, since he himself derives an advantage from it. 7. According to the principles of the ancient civil law, the creditor could demand payment from the surety without first resorting for payment to the principal debtor. But Justinian altered that rule, and gave to the surety an exception or plea, which is called an <i>exception of discussion</i>, or <i>of order</i>, by which he may require the creditor to proceed in the first instance against the principal debtor. And this rule, with some exceptions, was adopted into the ancient jurisprudence of France. But at no time, either in the civil or French law, did the bringing of a suit by the creditor against his principal debtor discharge the surety, who, therefore, remained bound until payment. And the omission of the creditor to institute a suit of discussion against the principal debtor, notwithstanding a request of the surety, until after the debtor becomes insolvent, is not thought to discharge the surety. But if a surety had contracted only to pay what the creditor <i>could not obtain</i> from the principal debtor, an omission to sue for a long time, and until after an insolvency, may discharge the surety. 8. To entitle the surety, after payment, to recover over against the principal debtor, it is necessary that the surety should not have neglected, by his own fault, to plead any proper plea in bar of the creditor; that the payment should have been valid, and should have discharged the principal debtor; and that the principal debtor should not have paid a second time by the fault of the surety. See <i>Pothier, Traite des Obligations part</i> 2. <i>ch.</i> 6. <i>s.</i> 1 <i>to</i> 8. The <i>Code Napoleon</i>, or civil code, adopts, for the most part, the doctrines stated in Pothier. <i>Liv.</i> 3. <i>tit.</i> 14. art. 2011, <i>&amp;c. to</i> 2043. It declares that a guaranty or suretyship, (<i>cautionnement</i>,) ought not to be presumed; it ought to be express; and ought not to be extended beyond the limits of the contract itself. An <i>indefinite</i> guaranty of a principal obligation extends to all the accessories of the debt. The guarantee is not bound to pay but upon the default of the debtor, who ought, in the first instance, to be sued <i>by discussion</i>, against his goods. In a suit against the guarantee, he may enter the same exceptions to the debt (except they are purely personal) as the principal debtor may. The surety is discharged, when by the act of the creditor the guarantee cannot have the benefit of a substitution to the rights, hypothecation, and privileges of the creditor. A simple postponement of the time granted by the creditor to the debtor, does not discharge the guarantee, who may, however, in that case, pursue the debtor to enforce payment. <i>Code Napoleon</i>, ubi supra. See also, the <i>Digest of the civil Laws of Louisiana, p.</i> 429. <i>Erskine's Institutes of the Laws of Scotland</i>, 10th ed. 326. The coincidences between the doctrines of the common law, and those of the civil law, and the codes derived from it, are very striking; and the differences in particular cases, seem to result rather from the difference of the remedies, of guaranties and sureties, under the various systems, (which, of course, require a corresponding change as to their liability,) than from any theoretical opposition in principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fng\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fng_ref\">g</a>\n        <p> Lord Arlington v.

JOHNSON, Justice, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>This case comes up on a bill of exceptions. This charge of the judge was given pro formâ, generally, against the plaintiff, and the verdict conforms to it. There are many counts in the declaration, and if on any one of those counts, the plaintiff was entitled to recover, the judgment below must be reversed.</p>\n<p>*The first count is on a refusal to pay two sets of bills, drawn on [*143 Taber &amp; Son, of Portland, payable in New York. These bills were duly protested and returned, and the amount, with damages, refunded by the plaintiff. In defence to this count, it is contended: that the undertaking of Barker, as expressed in his letter of the 9th of January 1806, relates to a different transaction from that upon which this cotton was purchased; that this transaction originated in the letters of the 26th of January, or 24th of July 1806, or of the 20th February 1807, and in neither of those letters is the undertaking, on bills to be drawn on Taber &amp; Son, reiterated: that the letters alluded to contain, in fact, an implied revocation of the undertaking in the letter of the 9th, of which the plaintiff was bound to take notice.</p>\n<p>To the correctness of these positions, this court cannot yield its assent. Nothing could be more inconsistent with that candor and good faith which ought to mark the transactions of mercantile men, than to favor the revocation of an explicit contract, on the construction of a correspondence nowhere avowing that object. It was in the defendant's power to have revoked his assumption, contained in the letter of the 9th, at any time prior to its execution, but it was incumbent on him to have done so, avowedly, and in language that could not be charged with equivocation. In this case, we discover nothing from which such an intention can fairly be inferred. The whole correspondence refers to the same subject, and has in view the same object. The expediting of the ship *Mac on freight, if freight could be obtained, [*144 and if not, to be filled up (at least, to the quantity of cotton here purchased), on owners' account. This agency the plaintiff undertakes, expressly on the credit of Barker, for a house, with whose credit, except on his introduction, he is unacquainted; and so far from restricting the order contained in the letter of the 9th, there is not one from the defendant, in the subsequent correspondence, that does not enlarge the order as to quantity, upon the contingency of the ship not getting freight.</p>\n<p>But it is contended, although the original assumption may not have been revoked, it was not complied with, according to the terms in which it was expressed, and therefore, was not binding to the defendant. And on this ground, so far as relates to the bills in this count, the court is of opinion, that the defence is supported on legal principles. The assumption is to guaranty bills, \"drawn on Taber &amp; Son, Portland, or me, at 60 days sight.\" These bills are drawn on Taber and Son, Portland, payable in New York. Now, although we cannot see why an honorable discharge of his contract did not prompt the defendant to accept these bills for the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> honor of the drawer, when they were returned to New York for non-acceptance, yet as it is our duty to construe the contracts of individuals, and not to make them, we are of opinion, that these bills were not drawn in conformity to the assumption of the defendant. Merchants well understand the difference between drawing bills upon a specified place, and drawing them upon one place, payable in another. We are not to inquire into the *145] *reasons which govern them in forming such contracts, or competent to judge, whether any other mode of complying with a contract may not be as convenient to them, as that which they have consented to be governed by. But it will be perceived, that this opinion can only affect the right of the plaintiff to recover the damages paid by him on the return of those bills, and has no effect in this view of the case, upon the plaintiff's right to recover upon the original guarantee of this debt; when legally demanded.</p>\n<p>It is, however, contended, that the election to draw in this form, was conclusive upon the plaintiff, and he could not afterwards resort to a draft upon the defendant himself. And this brings up the question upon the plaintiff's right to recover upon the second count. This count is on a refusal to pay a bill drawn on Barker himself, for the exact balance of the invoice of the cotton, after crediting the defendant with the bills that he had paid. This bill was not negotiated and returned, but drawn in favor of an agent of the plaintiff, and of course, no damages are demanded on it. The defence set up to this count, to wit, that the plaintiff, by making his election to draw upon Taber &amp; Son, is thereby precluded from resorting to Barker, we think, cannot be sustained. It is in vain that we look for any passage in the correspondence, that holds out this idea, nor is there anything in the nature of the transaction, that will sanction this court in attaching such a restriction to Barker's undertaking. It was, in effect, a promise to furnish the funds necessary to carry into execution this adventure. *146] *Had it contained a mere guarantee of bills to be drawn on Taber &amp; Son, there might have been some ground for this argument; but where the defendant confers the right to draw upon himself, and, in fact, clearly recommends a preference to such bills, he makes himself the paymaster, and we consider it an original substantive undertaking. In this view of the case, the law quoted on the subject of securityship undertakings cannot be applicable, and we think the plaintiff ought to recover on this count.</p>\n<p>There are other items in the plaintiff's demand, on which, as the case will be sent back, it is necessary to express an opinion. The first is the charge of about $1200 for services and expenses incident to this agency; the other is the charge of interest. The first of these items we are clearly of opinion the plaintiff is entitled to, and that it is recoverable, under the counts for services performed, and money expended in the discharge of this undertaking. And as to the second, we are equally satisfied, that interest is recoverable under the second count, in nature of damages.</p>\n<p>But some difficulty has arisen on the question, whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover the interest of New Orleans, or of New York. The former the bill of exceptions states to be ten per cent.; the latter, seven per cent. Where a general authority is given to draw bills from a certain place, on account of advances there made, the undertaking is to replace the money at that place. Had this bill on Barker been negotiated, and returned, under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> protest, the holder would have been entitled to demand of the drawer the interest of *New Orleans, and thus, incidentally, at least, the defendant [*147 would have been compelled to pay the plaintiff that interest. But it may be contended, that as the letter of the 26th appears to restrict the order for this purchase, so as to make it depend on the condition of the practicability of negotiating bills on New York, the undertaking of Barker was limited to payments to be made in New York. On this point, the court are of opinion, that, even though we attach this condition to Barker's undertaking, the liability to replace the money at New Orleans still continued; and any necessary loss on the bills, on account of the difference of exchange, would have been chargeable to the defendant; but we think, further, that the restrictive words in the letter alluded to, may justly be considered as enlarged into a general order, in his subsequent correspondence. The court is, therefore, of opinion, that as the money was advanced at New Orleans, and to be replaced at New Orleans, the plaintiff may claim the legal interest at that place.</p>\n<p>This court is of opinion, that there is error in the judgment below, and that it must be reversed. But this court can do no more than order a venire facias de novo.</p>\n<p>An attempt has been made to obtain from this court a mandate to the circuit court, to enter a judgment in conformity to an agreement of parties entered on the transcript, which states the amount to be adjudged to the plaintiff upon several alternatives. But we are of opinion, that this court can take no notice of that consent; the verdict presents no alternative; *and the consent entered on the transcript, or on the minutes of the [*148 circuit court, forms no part of the record brought up by this writ of error. Nor will this court be led into the exercise of a power so nearly approaching the province of a jury in assessing damages.</p>\n<p>Judgment reversed.<sup>[(a)]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> </p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> </p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> </p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> </p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> </p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[(a)]  Although contracts of guaranty are very familiar in the practice of the commercial world, comparatively few cases have been subjected to judicial decision in the English and American tribunals.

But at the same time, they are not extended beyond the obvious import of the terms in their reasonable interpretation. Where, in a letter of introduction of a mercantile firm, the defendants used the following terms  \"We do ourselves the pleasure of introducing them to your correspondence, as a house on whose integrity and punctuality, the utmost dependence may be placed; they will write you the nature of their intentions, and you may be assured of their complying fully with any contract or engagements they may enter into with you,\" it was held, that the letter did not import a guarantee of such engagements; and that parol evidence was not admissible, to explain the terms so as to affect their import, with regard to the supposed guaranty. Russell v. Clarke, 3 Dall. 415; s.c. 7 Cranch 69. So, where B. wrote to C., \"as I understand Messrs. A. &amp; Co. have given you an order for rigging, &amp;c., which will amount to 4000l. I can assure you, from what I know of A.'s honor and probity, you will be perfectly safe in crediting them to that amount; indeed, I have no *objection to guaranty you against any loss, from [*149 giving them this credit;\" it was held, that the writing did not import a perfect and conclusive guarantee, but only a proposition or overture tending to a guarantee; and that to make it a guarantee, B. ought to have had notice, that it was so regarded, and meant to be accepted, or there should have been a subsequent consent on his part, to convert it into a conclusive guarantee. McIver v. Richardson, 1 M. &amp; S. 557. But it is said, that the words are to be taken as strongly against the party giving the guarantee, as the sense of them will admit of. Therefore, where the defendant wrote to the plaintiff, \"I hereby promise to be responsible to T.M. (the plaintiff) for any goods he hath or may supply my brother W.P. to the amount of 100l.,\" it was held, that this was a standing or continuing guarantee to the extent of 100l., which might at any time become due, for goods supplied, until the credit was recalled. At the time the letter was written, goods had been supplied, to the amount of 66l., and afterwards, another parcel was delivered, amounting, together with the former, to 124l., all which had been paid for, and the sum now in dispute (and which by the judgment of the court, the plaintiff recovered), was for a further supply to W.P. Mason v. Pritchard, 2 Camp. 436; s.c. 12 East 227. So, where the defendant wrote to the plaintiff. \"I have been applied to by my brother, W.W., to be bound to you for any debts he may contract, not to exceed 100l. (with you), for goods necessary in his business as a jeweller; I have wrote to say, by this declaration, I consider myself bound to you for any debt he may contract for his business as a jeweller, not exceeding 100l., after this date;\" Lord ELLENBOROUGH said, that the defendant was answerable for any debt not exceeding 100l., which W.W. might, from time to time, contract with the plaintiff, in the way of business; that the guarantee was not confined to one instance, but applied to debts successively renewed; and that if a party meant to be a surety only for a single dealing, he should say so. Merle v. Wells, 2 Camp. 413. So, where the defendant wrote, *150] \"I hereby undertake and engage to be answerable to the extent of *300l. for any tallow or soap supplied by Mr. B. (the plaintiff) to F. &amp; B., provided they shall neglect to pay in due time;\" Lord ELLENBOROUGH held it to be a continuing guarantee, while the parties continued to deal on the footing established when it was given; but that goods supplied, after new arrangements were made, were not within the scope of the guarantee; and he relied on the word \"any,\" without which, he thought it might, perhaps, be confined to one dealing to the amount of 300l. Baston v. Bennett, 3 Camp. 220. But in debt on a bond entered into by A. and B. with the plaintiffs, reciting, that it was to enable A. to carry on his trade, and conditioned for the payment of all such sum or sums of money, not exceeding 3000l., with lawful interest, which should or might, at any time or times thereafter, be advanced and lent by the plaintiffs to A., or paid to his use, by his order and direction,\" it was held, that it was a guarantee for the definite amount of 3000l., and when an advance was made to that amount, the guarantee became functus officio, and was not a continuing guarantee. Kirby v. Duke of Marlborough, 2 M. &amp; S. 18. And, where the defendants wrote to the plaintiff, \"If W. &amp; B., our sons, wish to take goods of you, on credit, we are willing to lend our names as security for any amount they may wish,\" the court held, that it was not a continuing guarantee, but was confined to the first parcel of goods sold to W. &amp; B.; that it gave an unlimited credit as to amount, but was silent as to the continuance of the credit to future sales, and expressio unius, est exclusio alterius. Rogers v. Warner, 8 Johns. 119. And in a very recent case, where the defendants wrote to the plaintiff, \"our friends and connections, S. &amp; H.H., contemplate, under certain circumstances, making a considerable purchase of goods on the continent, and for that purpose, are about to send an agent to Europe; they wished a letter of credit from us, to increase their means and to be used or not as circumstances may require; as we are now indebted to you, and have no funds on the continent of Europe, we told them, we could not give *151] a positive letter of credit for any sum, but that we had no doubt, you would *be disposed to furnish them with funds under our guarantee; the object of the present letter is, therefore, to request you, if convenient, to furnish them with any sum they may want, as far as $50,000, say, 50,000 dollars; they will reimburse you the amount they receive, together with interest, as soon as arrangements can be made to do it; we shall hold ourselves answerable to you for the amount;\" it was held, that this was a guarantee for a single advance to the amount of $50,000, and not a continuing guarantee, toties quoties, to that amount, and that as soon as $50,000 were once advanced, the guarantee ceased to operate upon future advances, although by intermediate payments, the sum due at the time of such new advances, was below $50,000. Cremer v. Higginson, 1 Mason 323.[1] Where A. requested B. to give C. any assistance in the purchase of goods, by letter, or otherwise, adding, \"you may consider me accountable with him to you, for any contract he may make; it was held, that A. was to be considered as a guarantor, and not a joint-debtor, and that a contract by C. with B. to pay him a premium for guarantying a contract of C. with a third person was within A.'s promise. Meade v. McDowell, 5 Binn. 195.</p>\n<p>A guarantee to the plaintiffs, \"that if they will credit D. a sum not exceeding $500, in case he shall not pay it in twelve months, the guarantor will pay it,\" does not imply a condition that the plaintiff may not advance more than $500, if the additional advance be on the general credit of D. Sturges v. Robins, 7 Mass. 301.</p>\n<p>A guarantee, \"we, jointly and severally, promise to guarantee a payment of 500l. at five per cent. say, by a bill drawn on G.H., by D. &amp; F. for 500l., dated 10th of January 1808,\" is to be construed as a general guarantee of the bill, not (as usual) a guarantee that the acceptor should pay, but a contract that either the drawer or the acceptor should pay. Philips v. Astling, 2 Taunt. 206. But upon such a guarantee (if it is to be construed as limiting the bill to the specific sum of 500l.), the guarantor would not be liable to the extent even of the 500l., if the bill be drawn *for a larger sum; [*152 for the terms of the contract must be strictly complied with. Ibid. And a guarantee to A., for goods to be sold by him, on credit, to B., will not inure to the benefit of a third person, who shall actually furnish the goods to B., although at the request of A., for a surety is not to be held beyond the scope of his own engagement. Robbins v. Bingham, 4 Johns. 476; Walsh v. Bailie, 10 Ibid. 180. And see 1 M. &amp; S. 557. So, if a letter of credit be addressed to A., and part of the goods are delivered by A., and part by C. &amp; D., the latter cannot recover on the guarantee. Robbins v. Bingham, 4 Johns. 476. So, a letter of guaranty, addressed to J. &amp; A.N., by mistake, for J. &amp; J.N., will not cover advances made by the latter, on the faith of the letter. Grant v. Naylor, 4 Cranch 224.</p>\n<p>Many cases analogous to this have been decided. As, where A. became surety, by bond, that B should truly account to C. for all sums of money received by B., for C.'s use, and afterwards, B. took a partner, with C.'s knowledge, it was ruled, that the guarantee did not extend to sums received by B. and his partner, for C.'s use, after the formation of the partnership. Bellairs v. Elsworth, 3 Camp. 53. So, a bond conditioned to repay all sums advanced by five persons, or any of them, was held not to extend to sums advanced, after the decease of one of them, by the four survivors, the four then acting as bankers. Weston v. Barton, 4 Taunt. 674. And to the same effect will be found the following cases: Arlington v. Merritt, 2 Saund. 44; Wrightly v. Russell, 2 W. Bl. 934; s.c. 3 Wils. 539; Barker v. Parker, 1 T.R. 287; Myers v. Edge, 7 Ibid. 254; Strange v. Lee, 3 East 484. But if a bond be given to trustees, conditioned for the faithful service of a person, during his continuance in the service of a fluctuating or successive body of persons, not incorporated, as the Globe Insurance Company, it will extend to the whole time the party is in the service of such company, although the members may be continually changing. Metcalf v. Bruin, 12 East 400. An agent, in England, for merchants, the vendors of goods, in Russia, who guaranties \"that the shipment shall be in conformity with the revenue laws of Great Britain, so that no impediment *shall arise upon the importation thereof, or that, in default, the consequence [*153 shall rest with the sellers,\" makes himself personally responsible to the vendee. Readhead v. Cator, 1 Stark. 14. An impediment arising from non-compliance with the navigation act, is an impediment within the terms of the guarantee. And such a guarantee is not within the statute of frauds, if the terms of the agreement can be collected from the written correspondence between the parties. Ibid. A. engages to guaranty the amount of goods supplied by B. to C., provided 18 months credit be given; if B. give credit for 12 months only, he is not entitled, at the expiration of six months more, to call upon A. on his guarantee. But B. having, after the commencement of the action, delivered an invoice, from which it appeared that credit was given for 12 months only, is at liberty to show that this was a mistake, and that, in fact, 18 months credit was given. Bacon v. Chesney, 1 Stark. 192.</p>\n<p>In cases of guaranty, it has been made a question, whether the notice ought to be given to the guarantor of the advances made, and of the non-payment by the debtor. In Oxley v. Young, 2 H. Bl. 613, where the defendant, upon an undertaking of D. to indemnify him, guarantied to the plaintiff, an order sent to him by A. for certain goods, and the plaintiff informed the defendant, that the goods were preparing, but did not give him notice of the actual shipment, the court thought that the right to sue on the guarantee attached, when the order was put in a train for execution, subject to its being actually executed; and that the notice of such intended execution was sufficient; and the court further thought, that that right could not be divested, even by a wilful neglect of the plaintiff, though, perhaps, he might be liable to an action on the case, at the suit of the defendant, if any such neglect could be shown, contrary to all good faith, and by which a loss had been incurred. In Peel v. Tatlock, 1 Bos. &amp; Pul. 419, Chief Justice EYRE appears to have been of opinion, that at least, in guarantees for good behavior, notice of any embezzlement or fraud ought to be given, within a reasonable *154] time; but the case finally went off upon narrower grounds. In *Russell v. Clarke, 7 Cranch 69, 92, it was distinctly held by the court, that if the contract in that case had been a guarantee, it would certainly have been the duty of the plaintiff, to have given immediate notice to the defendant of the extent of his engagement. And the same doctrine was asserted in the circuit court, in Cremer v. Higginson, already cited.[1]</p>\n<p>Where there is a guarantee of advances or supplies, it is necessary, in the first instance, to make a demand of payment from the original debtor, or, at least, to use reasonable diligence in endeavoring to make such demand, and notice of non-payment must be given in a reasonable time to the guarantor. This may be collected as the general result of the cases on this subject. But where an agent, in England, for merchants, the vendors of goods, in Russia, who guaranties \"that the shipments shall be in conformity with the revenue laws of Great Britain, so that no impediment shall arise upon the importation thereof, or that, in default, the consequence shall rest with the sellers,\" it was held, that the agent made himself personally responsible to the vendee, and that in a declaration upon such a guarantee, against the agent, it is unnecessary to allege any application for indemnity to the principals. Readhead v. Cator, 1 Stark. 14. And it is not necessary to sue the debtor, before the right attaches to sue on the guarantee. Bank of New York v. Livingston, 2 Johns. Cas. 409. And where the guarantee is of a note or bill, payable at a future time, although it is not necessary to pursue the same strictness, in order to charge a guarantor, as to charge the drawer; yet a due demand and notice of non-payment ought to be given to the drawer and guarantor; and if the necessary steps are not taken to obtain payment from the parties who are liable on the bill, and solvent, the guarantor is discharged. Phillips v. Astling, 2 Taunt. 206; Warrington v. Furber, 8 East 245. But it is a sufficient excuse for not making a demand, that the debtor cannot be found, or that he is insolvent. Warrington v. Furber, 8 East 245; Phillips v. Astling, 2 Taunt. 206. And if there be gross laches in *155] securing the debt (Duval v. Trask, 13 Mass. 154; People v. Jansen, *7 Johns. 332; Hunt v. United States, 1 Gallis. 34); or if the creditor undertake to do anything whereby to lessen or postpone the responsibility of the debtor (Commissioners of Berks v. Ross, 3 Binn. 520); or if the right of the parties be altered, as, if any new debt have been incurred; or if the demand have been enlarged, to the prejudice of the guarantor (Peel v. Tatlock, 1 Bos. &amp; Pul. 419; King v. Baldwin, 2 Johns. Ch. 554; Boultbee v. Stubbs, 18 Ves. 20); or if the creditor give time to his debtor, without the knowledge of the guarantor (Skip v. Huey, 3 Atk. 91; 6 Ves. 809, note a; Rees v Berrington, 2 Ves. jr. 540; Nisbet v. Smith, 2 Bro. C.C. 579; Moore v. Bowmaker, 6 Taunt. 379; s.c. 2 Marsh. 81); or if, upon a guarantee of a partnership debt, the partnership debt is discharged, by carrying the proportions of each partner to his separate account, without any notice to the guarantor (Cremer v. Higginson, 1 Mason 323); or if there be a fraudulent concealment, to the injury of the guarantor (Oxley v. Young, 2 H. Bl. 613, semble, EYRE, C.J.); in all these cases, the guarantor is discharged. And it has been held, in a recent case, that if the holder of a note is requested by the surety (being one of the joint-makers), to proceed without delay, and collect the money of the principal, who is solvent, and he omits to do it, until the principal becomes insolvent, the surety will be exonerated at law. (Paine v. Packard, 13 Johns. 174.) But this decision has been questioned by very high authority. (King v. Baldwin, 2 Johns. Ch. 563, 564.) Where there are several debts due, some of which are guarantied and some not, and payments are made by one debtor, the same general rule applies in this, as in other cases, that where the debtor makes no application of any payment, the creditor may apply it to any account he pleases. (Kirby v. Duke of Marlborough, 2 M. &amp; S. 18; Dawson v. Remnant, 6 Esp. 26; Field v. Holland, 6 Cranch 3; Hutchinson v. Bell, 1 Taunt. 558; Sturgis v. Robbins, 7 Mass. 301.)</p>\n<p>Pothier, in his Treatise on Obligations, has discussed with great learning and ingenuity, the whole doctrine of suretyship and guarantee. Traité des *Obligations, [*156 part 2, ch. 6, § 1 to 8. Among other things, he remarks, that care should be taken not to take for a promise to become surety, what one says or writes, unless there be a well-marked intention to do so. Therefore, he adds, if I wrote or said to you, that a man who asked you to lend him money, was solvent, this could not be taken for an agreement to become a surety, for I might well have no other intention than to inform you of what I believed to be the case, and not to bind myself. On this principle, it was adjudged, in a case reported in Papon, X. 4, 12, that these words in a letter to the keeper of a boarding-house, \"A.B. intends to send his son to board with you; he is an honest man, and will pay you well,\" did not include an obligation. On the same principle, if I accompany a person to a woollen-draper's, where he buys cloth, the draper ought not to conclude, that I am security for him. The following distinctions and principles stated by this learned writer, seem worthy of notice, in reference to the subject of this note. 1. Where the surety has expressed the sum and cause for which he became surety, his obligation does not extend beyond the sum and cause expressed. As, if one become bound for the principal debt, he will not be liable for interest. 2. On the other hand, when the words of the suretyship are general and indeterminate, the surety is presumed to have bound himself for all the obligations of the debtor, resulting from the contract to which he acceded; and therefore, a surety, in general terms, is bound not only for the principal sum, but for interest; and not only for the interest due ex rei natura, but for that occasioned by the delay of the debtor. And this is conformable to the doctrine of the Roman law. 3. And in general, however unlimited the suretyship may be, it does not extend to the penalties to which the debtor may be condemned officio judicis propter suam contumaciam. 4. The obligation of suretyship is extinguished, by an extinction of the principal debt; by the creditor's disabling himself, by his own act, from ceding his action against his principal debtor, which the surety has an interest in having assigned to him; by the creditor's accepting in payment property, the title to which afterwards proves to be invalid, at least, if the principal debtor in *the meantime becomes insolvent. 5. And the principal debt may [*157 be extinguished, not only by payment, or a set-off, or release, but also by a novation of the debt, that is, by accepting a new obligation in discharge of the old one. 6. Pothier then puts the case, whether the surety be discharged, by the creditor's granting to the debtor a delay for the payment, and agrees with Vinnius, in holding the negative, for he says, the simple delay, not making the debt appear discharged, deprives the surety of no means of providing for his own safety, and the surety cannot pretend, that the delay prejudices him, since he himself derives an advantage from it. 7. According to the principles of the ancient civil law, the creditor could demand payment from the surety, without first resorting for payment to the principal debtor. But Justinian altered that rule, and gave to the surety an exception or plea, which is called an exception of discussion, or of order, by which he may require the creditor to proceed, in the first instance, against the principal debtor. And this rule, with some exceptions, was adopted into the ancient jurisprudence of France. But at no time, either in the civil or French law, did the bringing of a suit by the creditor, against his principal debtor, discharge the surety, who, therefore, remained bound, until payment. And the omission of the creditor to institute a suit of discussion, against the principal debtor, notwithstanding a request of the surety, until after the debtor becomes insolvent, is not thought to discharge the surety. But if a surety had contracted only to pay what the creditor could not obtain from the principal debtor, an omission to sue, for a long time, and until after an insolvency, may discharge the surety. 8. To entitle the surety, after payment, to recover over against the principal debtor, it is necessary, that the surety should not have neglected, by his own fault, to plead any proper plea in bar of the creditor; that the payment should have been valid, and should have discharged the principal debtor; and that the principal debtor should not have paid a second time, by the fault of the surety. See Pothier, Traité des Obligations, part 2, ch. 6, § 1 to 8. The Code Napoléon, or civil code, adopts, for the most *158] part, the *doctrines stated in Pothier. Liv. 3, tit. 14, art. 2011 to 2043. It declares, that a guarantee or suretyship (cautionnement) ought not to be presumed; it ought to be express; and ought not to be extended beyond the limits of the contract itself. An indefinite guarantee of a principal obligation extends to all the accessories of the debt. The guarantor is not bound to pay, but upon the default of the debtor, who ought, in the first instance, to be sued by discussion, against his goods. In a suit against the guarantor, he may enter the same exceptions to the debt (except they are purely personal) as the principal debtor may. The surety is discharged, when, by the act of the creditor, the guarantor cannot have the benefit of a substitution to the rights, hypothecation and privileges of the creditor. A simple postponement of the time, granted by the creditor to the debtor, does not discharge the guarantor, who may, however, in that case, pursue the debtor to enforce payment. Code Napoléon, ubi supra.</p>\n<p>See also, the Digest of the Civil Laws of Louisiana, p. 429. Erskine's Institutes of the Laws of Scotland, 10th ed., 326. The coincidences between the doctrines of the common law, and those of the civil law, and the codes derived from it, are very striking; and the differences in particular cases, seem to result rather from the difference of the remedies of guarantors and sureties, under the various systems (which, of course, require a corresponding change as to their liability), than from any theoretical opposition in principles.</p>\n<p>[1 Aldricks v Higgins, 16 S. &amp; R. 212; Anderson v.

Pendleton, for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p>The Attorney-General and Jones, contrà.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> February 17th, 1818. JOHNSON, Justice, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>This case comes up on a bill of exceptions. This charge of the judge was given pro formâ, generally, against the plaintiff, and the verdict conforms to it. There are many counts in the declaration, and if on any one of those counts, the plaintiff was entitled to recover, the judgment below must be reversed.</p>\n<p>*The first count is on a refusal to pay two sets of bills, drawn on [*143 Taber &amp; Son, of Portland, payable in New York. These bills were duly protested and returned, and the amount, with damages, refunded by the plaintiff. In defence to this count, it is contended: that the undertaking of Barker, as expressed in his letter of the 9th of January 1806, relates to a different transaction from that upon which this cotton was purchased; that this transaction originated in the letters of the 26th of January, or 24th of July 1806, or of the 20th February 1807, and in neither of those letters is the undertaking, on bills to be drawn on Taber &amp; Son, reiterated: that the letters alluded to contain, in fact, an implied revocation of the undertaking in the letter of the 9th, of which the plaintiff was bound to take notice.</p>\n<p>To the correctness of these positions, this court cannot yield its assent. Nothing could be more inconsistent with that candor and good faith which ought to mark the transactions of mercantile men, than to favor the revocation of an explicit contract, on the construction of a correspondence nowhere avowing that object. It was in the defendant's power to have revoked his assumption, contained in the letter of the 9th, at any time prior to its execution, but it was incumbent on him to have done so, avowedly, and in language that could not be charged with equivocation. In this case, we discover nothing from which such an intention can fairly be inferred. The whole correspondence refers to the same subject, and has in view the same object. The expediting of the ship *Mac on freight, if freight could be obtained, [*144 and if not, to be filled up (at least, to the quantity of cotton here purchased), on owners' account. This agency the plaintiff undertakes, expressly on the credit of Barker, for a house, with whose credit, except on his introduction, he is unacquainted; and so far from restricting the order contained in the letter of the 9th, there is not one from the defendant, in the subsequent correspondence, that does not enlarge the order as to quantity, upon the contingency of the ship not getting freight.</p>\n<p>But it is contended, although the original assumption may not have been revoked, it was not complied with, according to the terms in which it was expressed, and therefore, was not binding to the defendant. And on this ground, so far as relates to the bills in this count, the court is of opinion, that the defence is supported on legal principles. The assumption is to guaranty bills, \"drawn on Taber &amp; Son, Portland, or me, at 60 days sight.\" These bills are drawn on Taber and Son, Portland, payable in New York. Now, although we cannot see why an honorable discharge of his contract did not prompt the defendant to accept these bills for the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> honor of the drawer, when they were returned to New York for non-acceptance, yet as it is our duty to construe the contracts of individuals, and not to make them, we are of opinion, that these bills were not drawn in conformity to the assumption of the defendant. Merchants well understand the difference between drawing bills upon a specified place, and drawing them upon one place, payable in another. We are not to inquire into the *145] *reasons which govern them in forming such contracts, or competent to judge, whether any other mode of complying with a contract may not be as convenient to them, as that which they have consented to be governed by. But it will be perceived, that this opinion can only affect the right of the plaintiff to recover the damages paid by him on the return of those bills, and has no effect in this view of the case, upon the plaintiff's right to recover upon the original guarantee of this debt; when legally demanded.</p>\n<p>It is, however, contended, that the election to draw in this form, was conclusive upon the plaintiff, and he could not afterwards resort to a draft upon the defendant himself. And this brings up the question upon the plaintiff's right to recover upon the second count. This count is on a refusal to pay a bill drawn on Barker himself, for the exact balance of the invoice of the cotton, after crediting the defendant with the bills that he had paid. This bill was not negotiated and returned, but drawn in favor of an agent of the plaintiff, and of course, no damages are demanded on it. The defence set up to this count, to wit, that the plaintiff, by making his election to draw upon Taber &amp; Son, is thereby precluded from resorting to Barker, we think, cannot be sustained. It is in vain that we look for any passage in the correspondence, that holds out this idea, nor is there anything in the nature of the transaction, that will sanction this court in attaching such a restriction to Barker's undertaking. It was, in effect, a promise to furnish the funds necessary to carry into execution this adventure. *146] *Had it contained a mere guarantee of bills to be drawn on Taber &amp; Son, there might have been some ground for this argument; but where the defendant confers the right to draw upon himself, and, in fact, clearly recommends a preference to such bills, he makes himself the paymaster, and we consider it an original substantive undertaking. In this view of the case, the law quoted on the subject of securityship undertakings cannot be applicable, and we think the plaintiff ought to recover on this count.</p>\n<p>There are other items in the plaintiff's demand, on which, as the case will be sent back, it is necessary to express an opinion. The first is the charge of about $1200 for services and expenses incident to this agency; the other is the charge of interest. The first of these items we are clearly of opinion the plaintiff is entitled to, and that it is recoverable, under the counts for services performed, and money expended in the discharge of this undertaking. And as to the second, we are equally satisfied, that interest is recoverable under the second count, in nature of damages.</p>\n<p>But some difficulty has arisen on the question, whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover the interest of New Orleans, or of New York. The former the bill of exceptions states to be ten per cent.; the latter, seven per cent. Where a general authority is given to draw bills from a certain place, on account of advances there made, the undertaking is to replace the money at that place. Had this bill on Barker been negotiated, and returned, under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> protest, the holder would have been entitled to demand of the drawer the interest of *New Orleans, and thus, incidentally, at least, the defendant [*147 would have been compelled to pay the plaintiff that interest. But it may be contended, that as the letter of the 26th appears to restrict the order for this purchase, so as to make it depend on the condition of the practicability of negotiating bills on New York, the undertaking of Barker was limited to payments to be made in New York. On this point, the court are of opinion, that, even though we attach this condition to Barker's undertaking, the liability to replace the money at New Orleans still continued; and any necessary loss on the bills, on account of the difference of exchange, would have been chargeable to the defendant; but we think, further, that the restrictive words in the letter alluded to, may justly be considered as enlarged into a general order, in his subsequent correspondence. The court is, therefore, of opinion, that as the money was advanced at New Orleans, and to be replaced at New Orleans, the plaintiff may claim the legal interest at that place.</p>\n<p>This court is of opinion, that there is error in the judgment below, and that it must be reversed. But this court can do no more than order a venire facias de novo.</p>\n<p>An attempt has been made to obtain from this court a mandate to the circuit court, to enter a judgment in conformity to an agreement of parties entered on the transcript, which states the amount to be adjudged to the plaintiff upon several alternatives. But we are of opinion, that this court can take no notice of that consent; the verdict presents no alternative; *and the consent entered on the transcript, or on the minutes of the [*148 circuit court, forms no part of the record brought up by this writ of error. Nor will this court be led into the exercise of a power so nearly approaching the province of a jury in assessing damages.</p>\n<p>Judgment reversed.<sup>[(a)]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> </p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> </p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> </p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> </p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> </p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[(a)]  Although contracts of guaranty are very familiar in the practice of the commercial world, comparatively few cases have been subjected to judicial decision in the English and American tribunals. It may not, however, be without use to the learned reader, to collect the principal adjudications on this subject, especially, as no attempt has yet been made to bring them before the public in a connected view.\n</p>\n<p>Contracts of guaranty, like all commercial contracts, have received a liberal interpretation, in furtherance of the intention of the parties. But at the same time, they are not extended beyond the obvious import of the terms in their reasonable interpretation. Where, in a letter of introduction of a mercantile firm, the defendants used the following terms  \"We do ourselves the pleasure of introducing them to your correspondence, as a house on whose integrity and punctuality, the utmost dependence may be placed; they will write you the nature of their intentions, and you may be assured of their complying fully with any contract or engagements they may enter into with you,\" it was held, that the letter did not import a guarantee of such engagements; and that parol evidence was not admissible, to explain the terms so as to affect their import, with regard to the supposed guaranty. Russell v. Clarke, 3 Dall. 415; s.c. 7 Cranch 69. So, where B. wrote to C., \"as I understand Messrs. A. &amp; Co. have given you an order for rigging, &amp;c., which will amount to 4000l. I can assure you, from what I know of A.'s honor and probity, you will be perfectly safe in crediting them to that amount; indeed, I have no *objection to guaranty you against any loss, from [*149 giving them this credit;\" it was held, that the writing did not import a perfect and conclusive guarantee, but only a proposition or overture tending to a guarantee; and that to make it a guarantee, B. ought to have had notice, that it was so regarded, and meant to be accepted, or there should have been a subsequent consent on his part, to convert it into a conclusive guarantee. McIver v. Richardson, 1 M. &amp; S. 557. But it is said, that the words are to be taken as strongly against the party giving the guarantee, as the sense of them will admit of. Therefore, where the defendant wrote to the plaintiff, \"I hereby promise to be responsible to T.M. (the plaintiff) for any goods he hath or may supply my brother W.P. to the amount of 100l.,\" it was held, that this was a standing or continuing guarantee to the extent of 100l., which might at any time become due, for goods supplied, until the credit was recalled. At the time the letter was written, goods had been supplied, to the amount of 66l., and afterwards, another parcel was delivered, amounting, together with the former, to 124l., all which had been paid for, and the sum now in dispute (and which by the judgment of the court, the plaintiff recovered), was for a further supply to W.P. Mason v. Pritchard, 2 Camp. 436; s.c. 12 East 227. So, where the defendant wrote to the plaintiff. \"I have been applied to by my brother, W.W., to be bound to you for any debts he may contract, not to exceed 100l. (with you), for goods necessary in his business as a jeweller; I have wrote to say, by this declaration, I consider myself bound to you for any debt he may contract for his business as a jeweller, not exceeding 100l., after this date;\" Lord ELLENBOROUGH said, that the defendant was answerable for any debt not exceeding 100l., which W.W. might, from time to time, contract with the plaintiff, in the way of business; that the guarantee was not confined to one instance, but applied to debts successively renewed; and that if a party meant to be a surety only for a single dealing, he should say so. Merle v. Wells, 2 Camp. 413. So, where the defendant wrote, *150] \"I hereby undertake and engage to be answerable to the extent of *300l. for any tallow or soap supplied by Mr. B. (the plaintiff) to F. &amp; B., provided they shall neglect to pay in due time;\" Lord ELLENBOROUGH held it to be a continuing guarantee, while the parties continued to deal on the footing established when it was given; but that goods supplied, after new arrangements were made, were not within the scope of the guarantee; and he relied on the word \"any,\" without which, he thought it might, perhaps, be confined to one dealing to the amount of 300l. Baston v. Bennett, 3 Camp. 220. But in debt on a bond entered into by A. and B. with the plaintiffs, reciting, that it was to enable A. to carry on his trade, and conditioned for the payment of all such sum or sums of money, not exceeding 3000l., with lawful interest, which should or might, at any time or times thereafter, be advanced and lent by the plaintiffs to A., or paid to his use, by his order and direction,\" it was held, that it was a guarantee for the definite amount of 3000l., and when an advance was made to that amount, the guarantee became functus officio, and was not a continuing guarantee. Kirby v. Duke of Marlborough, 2 M. &amp; S. 18. And, where the defendants wrote to the plaintiff, \"If W. &amp; B., our sons, wish to take goods of you, on credit, we are willing to lend our names as security for any amount they may wish,\" the court held, that it was not a continuing guarantee, but was confined to the first parcel of goods sold to W. &amp; B.; that it gave an unlimited credit as to amount, but was silent as to the continuance of the credit to future sales, and expressio unius, est exclusio alterius. Rogers v. Warner, 8 Johns. 119. And in a very recent case, where the defendants wrote to the plaintiff, \"our friends and connections, S. &amp; H.H., contemplate, under certain circumstances, making a considerable purchase of goods on the continent, and for that purpose, are about to send an agent to Europe; they wished a letter of credit from us, to increase their means and to be used or not as circumstances may require; as we are now indebted to you, and have no funds on the continent of Europe, we told them, we could not give *151] a positive letter of credit for any sum, but that we had no doubt, you would *be disposed to furnish them with funds under our guarantee; the object of the present letter is, therefore, to request you, if convenient, to furnish them with any sum they may want, as far as $50,000, say, 50,000 dollars; they will reimburse you the amount they receive, together with interest, as soon as arrangements can be made to do it; we shall hold ourselves answerable to you for the amount;\" it was held, that this was a guarantee for a single advance to the amount of $50,000, and not a continuing guarantee, toties quoties, to that amount, and that as soon as $50,000 were once advanced, the guarantee ceased to operate upon future advances, although by intermediate payments, the sum due at the time of such new advances, was below $50,000. Cremer v. Higginson, 1 Mason 323.[1] Where A. requested B. to give C. any assistance in the purchase of goods, by letter, or otherwise, adding, \"you may consider me accountable with him to you, for any contract he may make; it was held, that A. was to be considered as a guarantor, and not a joint-debtor, and that a contract by C. with B. to pay him a premium for guarantying a contract of C. with a third person was within A.'s promise. Meade v. McDowell, 5 Binn. 195.</p>\n<p>A guarantee to the plaintiffs, \"that if they will credit D. a sum not exceeding $500, in case he shall not pay it in twelve months, the guarantor will pay it,\" does not imply a condition that the plaintiff may not advance more than $500, if the additional advance be on the general credit of D. Sturges v. Robins, 7 Mass. 301.</p>\n<p>A guarantee, \"we, jointly and severally, promise to guarantee a payment of 500l. at five per cent. say, by a bill drawn on G.H., by D. &amp; F. for 500l., dated 10th of January 1808,\" is to be construed as a general guarantee of the bill, not (as usual) a guarantee that the acceptor should pay, but a contract that either the drawer or the acceptor should pay. Philips v. Astling, 2 Taunt. 206. But upon such a guarantee (if it is to be construed as limiting the bill to the specific sum of 500l.), the guarantor would not be liable to the extent even of the 500l., if the bill be drawn *for a larger sum; [*152 for the terms of the contract must be strictly complied with. Ibid. And a guarantee to A., for goods to be sold by him, on credit, to B., will not inure to the benefit of a third person, who shall actually furnish the goods to B., although at the request of A., for a surety is not to be held beyond the scope of his own engagement. Robbins v. Bingham, 4 Johns. 476; Walsh v. Bailie, 10 Ibid. 180. And see 1 M. &amp; S. 557. So, if a letter of credit be addressed to A., and part of the goods are delivered by A., and part by C. &amp; D., the latter cannot recover on the guarantee. Robbins v. Bingham, 4 Johns. 476. So, a letter of guaranty, addressed to J. &amp; A.N., by mistake, for J. &amp; J.N., will not cover advances made by the latter, on the faith of the letter. Grant v. Naylor, 4 Cranch 224.</p>\n<p>Many cases analogous to this have been decided. As, where A. became surety, by bond, that B should truly account to C. for all sums of money received by B., for C.'s use, and afterwards, B. took a partner, with C.'s knowledge, it was ruled, that the guarantee did not extend to sums received by B. and his partner, for C.'s use, after the formation of the partnership. Bellairs v. Elsworth, 3 Camp. 53. So, a bond conditioned to repay all sums advanced by five persons, or any of them, was held not to extend to sums advanced, after the decease of one of them, by the four survivors, the four then acting as bankers. Weston v. Barton, 4 Taunt. 674. And to the same effect will be found the following cases: Arlington v. Merritt, 2 Saund. 44; Wrightly v. Russell, 2 W. Bl. 934; s.c. 3 Wils. 539; Barker v. Parker, 1 T.R. 287; Myers v. Edge, 7 Ibid. 254; Strange v. Lee, 3 East 484. But if a bond be given to trustees, conditioned for the faithful service of a person, during his continuance in the service of a fluctuating or successive body of persons, not incorporated, as the Globe Insurance Company, it will extend to the whole time the party is in the service of such company, although the members may be continually changing. Metcalf v. Bruin, 12 East 400. An agent, in England, for merchants, the vendors of goods, in Russia, who guaranties \"that the shipment shall be in conformity with the revenue laws of Great Britain, so that no impediment *shall arise upon the importation thereof, or that, in default, the consequence [*153 shall rest with the sellers,\" makes himself personally responsible to the vendee. Readhead v. Cator, 1 Stark. 14. An impediment arising from non-compliance with the navigation act, is an impediment within the terms of the guarantee. And such a guarantee is not within the statute of frauds, if the terms of the agreement can be collected from the written correspondence between the parties. Ibid. A. engages to guaranty the amount of goods supplied by B. to C., provided 18 months credit be given; if B. give credit for 12 months only, he is not entitled, at the expiration of six months more, to call upon A. on his guarantee. But B. having, after the commencement of the action, delivered an invoice, from which it appeared that credit was given for 12 months only, is at liberty to show that this was a mistake, and that, in fact, 18 months credit was given. Bacon v. Chesney, 1 Stark. 192.</p>\n<p>In cases of guaranty, it has been made a question, whether the notice ought to be given to the guarantor of the advances made, and of the non-payment by the debtor. In Oxley v. Young, 2 H. Bl. 613, where the defendant, upon an undertaking of D. to indemnify him, guarantied to the plaintiff, an order sent to him by A. for certain goods, and the plaintiff informed the defendant, that the goods were preparing, but did not give him notice of the actual shipment, the court thought that the right to sue on the guarantee attached, when the order was put in a train for execution, subject to its being actually executed; and that the notice of such intended execution was sufficient; and the court further thought, that that right could not be divested, even by a wilful neglect of the plaintiff, though, perhaps, he might be liable to an action on the case, at the suit of the defendant, if any such neglect could be shown, contrary to all good faith, and by which a loss had been incurred. In Peel v. Tatlock, 1 Bos. &amp; Pul. 419, Chief Justice EYRE appears to have been of opinion, that at least, in guarantees for good behavior, notice of any embezzlement or fraud ought to be given, within a reasonable *154] time; but the case finally went off upon narrower grounds. In *Russell v. Clarke, 7 Cranch 69, 92, it was distinctly held by the court, that if the contract in that case had been a guarantee, it would certainly have been the duty of the plaintiff, to have given immediate notice to the defendant of the extent of his engagement. And the same doctrine was asserted in the circuit court, in Cremer v. Higginson, already cited.[1]</p>\n<p>Where there is a guarantee of advances or supplies, it is necessary, in the first instance, to make a demand of payment from the original debtor, or, at least, to use reasonable diligence in endeavoring to make such demand, and notice of non-payment must be given in a reasonable time to the guarantor. This may be collected as the general result of the cases on this subject. But where an agent, in England, for merchants, the vendors of goods, in Russia, who guaranties \"that the shipments shall be in conformity with the revenue laws of Great Britain, so that no impediment shall arise upon the importation thereof, or that, in default, the consequence shall rest with the sellers,\" it was held, that the agent made himself personally responsible to the vendee, and that in a declaration upon such a guarantee, against the agent, it is unnecessary to allege any application for indemnity to the principals. Readhead v. Cator, 1 Stark. 14. And it is not necessary to sue the debtor, before the right attaches to sue on the guarantee. Bank of New York v. Livingston, 2 Johns. Cas. 409. And where the guarantee is of a note or bill, payable at a future time, although it is not necessary to pursue the same strictness, in order to charge a guarantor, as to charge the drawer; yet a due demand and notice of non-payment ought to be given to the drawer and guarantor; and if the necessary steps are not taken to obtain payment from the parties who are liable on the bill, and solvent, the guarantor is discharged. Phillips v. Astling, 2 Taunt. 206; Warrington v. Furber, 8 East 245. But it is a sufficient excuse for not making a demand, that the debtor cannot be found, or that he is insolvent. Warrington v. Furber, 8 East 245; Phillips v. Astling, 2 Taunt. 206. And if there be gross laches in *155] securing the debt (Duval v. Trask, 13 Mass. 154; People v. Jansen, *7 Johns. 332; Hunt v. United States, 1 Gallis. 34); or if the creditor undertake to do anything whereby to lessen or postpone the responsibility of the debtor (Commissioners of Berks v. Ross, 3 Binn. 520); or if the right of the parties be altered, as, if any new debt have been incurred; or if the demand have been enlarged, to the prejudice of the guarantor (Peel v. Tatlock, 1 Bos. &amp; Pul. 419; King v. Baldwin, 2 Johns. Ch. 554; Boultbee v. Stubbs, 18 Ves. 20); or if the creditor give time to his debtor, without the knowledge of the guarantor (Skip v. Huey, 3 Atk. 91; 6 Ves. 809, note a; Rees v Berrington, 2 Ves. jr. 540; Nisbet v. Smith, 2 Bro. C.C. 579; Moore v. Bowmaker, 6 Taunt. 379; s.c. 2 Marsh. 81); or if, upon a guarantee of a partnership debt, the partnership debt is discharged, by carrying the proportions of each partner to his separate account, without any notice to the guarantor (Cremer v. Higginson, 1 Mason 323); or if there be a fraudulent concealment, to the injury of the guarantor (Oxley v. Young, 2 H. Bl. 613, semble, EYRE, C.J.); in all these cases, the guarantor is discharged. And it has been held, in a recent case, that if the holder of a note is requested by the surety (being one of the joint-makers), to proceed without delay, and collect the money of the principal, who is solvent, and he omits to do it, until the principal becomes insolvent, the surety will be exonerated at law. (Paine v. Packard, 13 Johns. 174.) But this decision has been questioned by very high authority. (King v. Baldwin, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Johns. Ch.</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></span>, 564.) Where there are several debts due, some of which are guarantied and some not, and payments are made by one debtor, the same general rule applies in this, as in other cases, that where the debtor makes no application of any payment, the creditor may apply it to any account he pleases. (Kirby v. Duke of Marlborough, 2 M. &amp; S. 18; Dawson v. Remnant, 6 Esp. 26; Field v. Holland, 6 Cranch 3; Hutchinson v. Bell, 1 Taunt. 558; Sturgis v. Robbins, 7 Mass. 301.)</p>\n<p>Pothier, in his Treatise on Obligations, has discussed with great learning and ingenuity, the whole doctrine of suretyship and guarantee. Traité des *Obligations, [*156 part 2, ch. 6, § 1 to 8. Among other things, he remarks, that care should be taken not to take for a promise to become surety, what one says or writes, unless there be a well-marked intention to do so. Therefore, he adds, if I wrote or said to you, that a man who asked you to lend him money, was solvent, this could not be taken for an agreement to become a surety, for I might well have no other intention than to inform you of what I believed to be the case, and not to bind myself. On this principle, it was adjudged, in a case reported in Papon, X. 4, 12, that these words in a letter to the keeper of a boarding-house, \"A.B. intends to send his son to board with you; he is an honest man, and will pay you well,\" did not include an obligation. On the same principle, if I accompany a person to a woollen-draper's, where he buys cloth, the draper ought not to conclude, that I am security for him. The following distinctions and principles stated by this learned writer, seem worthy of notice, in reference to the subject of this note. 1. Where the surety has expressed the sum and cause for which he became surety, his obligation does not extend beyond the sum and cause expressed. As, if one become bound for the principal debt, he will not be liable for interest. 2. On the other hand, when the words of the suretyship are general and indeterminate, the surety is presumed to have bound himself for all the obligations of the debtor, resulting from the contract to which he acceded; and therefore, a surety, in general terms, is bound not only for the principal sum, but for interest; and not only for the interest due ex rei natura, but for that occasioned by the delay of the debtor. And this is conformable to the doctrine of the Roman law. 3. And in general, however unlimited the suretyship may be, it does not extend to the penalties to which the debtor may be condemned officio judicis propter suam contumaciam. 4. The obligation of suretyship is extinguished, by an extinction of the principal debt; by the creditor's disabling himself, by his own act, from ceding his action against his principal debtor, which the surety has an interest in having assigned to him; by the creditor's accepting in payment property, the title to which afterwards proves to be invalid, at least, if the principal debtor in *the meantime becomes insolvent. 5. And the principal debt may [*157 be extinguished, not only by payment, or a set-off, or release, but also by a novation of the debt, that is, by accepting a new obligation in discharge of the old one. 6. Pothier then puts the case, whether the surety be discharged, by the creditor's granting to the debtor a delay for the payment, and agrees with Vinnius, in holding the negative, for he says, the simple delay, not making the debt appear discharged, deprives the surety of no means of providing for his own safety, and the surety cannot pretend, that the delay prejudices him, since he himself derives an advantage from it. 7. According to the principles of the ancient civil law, the creditor could demand payment from the surety, without first resorting for payment to the principal debtor. But Justinian altered that rule, and gave to the surety an exception or plea, which is called an exception of discussion, or of order, by which he may require the creditor to proceed, in the first instance, against the principal debtor. And this rule, with some exceptions, was adopted into the ancient jurisprudence of France. But at no time, either in the civil or French law, did the bringing of a suit by the creditor, against his principal debtor, discharge the surety, who, therefore, remained bound, until payment. And the omission of the creditor to institute a suit of discussion, against the principal debtor, notwithstanding a request of the surety, until after the debtor becomes insolvent, is not thought to discharge the surety. But if a surety had contracted only to pay what the creditor could not obtain from the principal debtor, an omission to sue, for a long time, and until after an insolvency, may discharge the surety. 8. To entitle the surety, after payment, to recover over against the principal debtor, it is necessary, that the surety should not have neglected, by his own fault, to plead any proper plea in bar of the creditor; that the payment should have been valid, and should have discharged the principal debtor; and that the principal debtor should not have paid a second time, by the fault of the surety. See Pothier, Traité des Obligations, part 2, ch. 6, § 1 to 8. The Code Napoléon, or civil code, adopts, for the most *158] part, the *doctrines stated in Pothier. Liv. 3, tit. 14, art. 2011 to 2043. It declares, that a guarantee or suretyship (cautionnement) ought not to be presumed; it ought to be express; and ought not to be extended beyond the limits of the contract itself. An indefinite guarantee of a principal obligation extends to all the accessories of the debt. The guarantor is not bound to pay, but upon the default of the debtor, who ought, in the first instance, to be sued by discussion, against his goods. In a suit against the guarantor, he may enter the same exceptions to the debt (except they are purely personal) as the principal debtor may. The surety is discharged, when, by the act of the creditor, the guarantor cannot have the benefit of a substitution to the rights, hypothecation and privileges of the creditor. A simple postponement of the time, granted by the creditor to the debtor, does not discharge the guarantor, who may, however, in that case, pursue the debtor to enforce payment. Code Napoléon, ubi supra.</p>\n<p>See also, the Digest of the Civil Laws of Louisiana, p. 429. Erskine's Institutes of the Laws of Scotland, 10th ed., 326. The coincidences between the doctrines of the common law, and those of the civil law, and the codes derived from it, are very striking; and the differences in particular cases, seem to result rather from the difference of the remedies of guarantors and sureties, under the various systems (which, of course, require a corresponding change as to their liability), than from any theoretical opposition in principles.</p>\n<p>[1 Aldricks v Higgins, 16 S. &amp; R. 212; Anderson v.
