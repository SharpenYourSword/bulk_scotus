Upon the evidence, it appears, that the goods were invoiced at sixty or seventy per cent. below the price in New Orleans; which is supposed, was at least as high as the price would have been in Liverpool: but it also appears, that goods of this kind, at the time of their exportation from Bordeaux, were depreciated in value to an equal degree: and it is proved, that the same goods were offered to a witness at 50 per cent. below their cost at Liverpool. The court is, therefore, not satisfied, that the goods were invoiced below their true value at Bordeaux, *234] with a design to evade the lawful *duties; and the inquiry as to their value in the port from which they were originally shipped is excluded, by the form in which the libel is drawn.
