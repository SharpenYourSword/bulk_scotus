A writ of error lodged in the Clerk's office, within ten days after the rendition of judgment, operates as a <i>supersedeas</i> of execution; and the question arises, whether, in cases where it operates as a <i>supersedeas</i>, the security taken by the Judge or Justice ought not to be sufficient to secure the whole amount of the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has been supposed at the argument, that the act meant only to provide for such damages and costs as the Court should adjudge for the delay.

The word 'damages' is here used, not as descriptive of the nature of the claim upon which the original judgment is founded, but as descriptive of the indemnity which the defendant is entitled to, if the judgment is affirmed. Whatever losses he may sustain by the judgment's not being satisfied and paid, after the affirmance, these are the damages which he has sustained, and for which the bond ought to give good and sufficient security.
