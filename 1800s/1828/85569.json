Upon the confession of judgment for 11,695 dollars 20 cents, the Court gave a judgment which was erroneous, as to this sum, beyond the amount claimed in the declaration. The law of Virginia, which authorizes a jury to give damages, as the principal of the debt, to the amount laid in the declaration, and to allow interest from a preceding period, making the whole amount of the verdict greater than the damages in the declaration; does not apply in this case, as the debt is a sterling debt.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this judgment is sustained, the plaintiff in error will be compelled to pay interest upon interest, as both principal and interest are included in the sum allowed by the Auditor. The verdict of a jury, giving the principal and interest from a particular day, on the same, would have had a different effect.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Taylor, for defendants in error.&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court should allow the defendants damages upon the amount of the judgment, as the plaintiff in error was not justified in thus proceeding against his own confession of judgment, and its whole purpose was delay. The form of the confession of judgment is such as is usual; and it is the same form of judgment, as upon the verdict of a jury. The law of Virginia authorizes a jury to give damages, which may, in the whole amount, exceed the damages laid in the declaration. The interest being stated to commence at a period anterior to the day of trial, a party may come in, and agree to enlarge damages. By the Act of Assembly, in Virginia, in 1792, a judgment by confession is equivalent to a release of errors.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court are satisfied in this case, that under the law of Virginia, a confession of judgment by the plaintiff in error, in the original suit, is a release of errors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment affirmed, with costs and damages, at the rate of six per centum per annum.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
