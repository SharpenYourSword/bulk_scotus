But a motion to dismiss a suit, for want of jurisdiction, applies solely to cases where this Court has not jurisdiction of the cause, and not to cases where the circuit court has exceeded its proper powers in the particular case. In the present case, this Court has, certainly, jurisdiction to revise the decree complained of in the circuit court. Whether that decree was proper or not, after the mandate of this Court, is matter for discussion upon an argument upon the merits of that decree; but not on a motion like the present. The motion is, therefore, overruled.</p>\n</div>",
