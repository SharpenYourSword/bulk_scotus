The district court sustained the demurrer and decided against the plaintiff's right of action.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The causes of demurrer shown by the defendant in error, were:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. That the replication does not allege and set forth that the will of the testator was proved, and that letters testamentary were granted to the executor in the state of Mississippi.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. That the replication does not show that the will of the testator was proved, and probate thereof granted to the executor or any other person within the jurisdiction of the court; nor that it was granted by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Jones, for the plaintiff, contended that the assignment being consummate in the jurisdiction where the executor's authority was indisputable, operated a complete transfer of the chose in action there; and carried with it a right of action every where; to which no new probate, or letters testamentary, could have added any validity whatsoever.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No counsel appeared for the defendant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an action of debt brought by the plaintiff in error, in the court of the United States for the district of Mississippi, as the assignee of Henry Clay, executor of James Morrison deceased.
