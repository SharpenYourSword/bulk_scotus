The judges being opposed upon this question, it was referred to this Court for their opinion.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question now referred to this Court differs from that which was decided in Patton's lessee <i>vs.</i> Easton, 1 <i>Wheat</i>. 476, in this, that the defendant who sets up a possession of seven years in bar of the plaintiff's title, endeavours to connect himself with a grant.
