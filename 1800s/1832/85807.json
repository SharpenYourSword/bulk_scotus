To show that this was not a sufficient description of the defendant to give the courts of the United States jurisdiction, the following cases were cited. Coxe's Digest, 434. 3 Dall. 382. 4 Dall. 11. 1 Cranch, 343. 2 Cranch, 9, 126. 5 Cranch, 303. 6 Wheat. 450.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr Key, for the defendant in error. The averment is, that the defendant in the district court resides in the parish of West Baton Rouge, where he has caused himself to be naturalized as an American citizen. He is then a citizen of the United States, made so by naturalization, and residing in Louisiana. This makes him a citizen of Louisiana; he became so by residing in that state. Cited, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 546. 1 Paine, 580. Gordon's Digest, 270.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case the court is of opinion that the jurisdiction can be sustained.
