The bills and notes of this bank were made receivable in all payments for taxes and other demands of the state: the interest arising from loans and discounts, after the payment of expenses, became part of the annual revenue, and the revenue of the state was made part of the capital of the bank. The management of the institution was entrusted to a president and twelve directors, chosen annually, by joint ballot of both houses of the general assembly. See the act, 2 Littell and Swigert's Digest of the Stat. Laws of Kentucky, sec. 1, 3, 5, 17, 24, 25, pp. 155, 156, 159, 162, 163.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the 25th of December 1820, the legislature passed another act, making it lawful, when any execution should issue, for the plaintiff to indorse thereon, that notes of the Bank of Kentucky or its branches, or notes of the Bank of the Commonwealth or its branches, would be received in payment; whereupon such execution should be collected and replevied agreeably to the laws then in force, allowing three months replevin only. But if any execution issued without such indorsement, such execution was allowed to be stayed two years, on giving bond with approved security, &amp;c., 2 Littell and Swigert's Digest, 459, 500, sec. 1 and 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was an action brought in March 1831, in the circuit court of Mercer circuit, Kentucky, by the bank so incorporated, against George H. Briscoe and others, to recover the sum of two thousand and forty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents, the amount of a promissory note given by them to the bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants in the court below, the plaintiffs in error, pleaded, in substance, that the note sued on was given in renewal of another note, and that of a preceding one; and that the only consideration given for the original note, by the said bank, was bills of credit issued by the state of Kentucky, through and by means of the said bank, contrary to the constitution of the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the pleas of the defendants the plaintiffs demurred, and the circuit court sustained the demurrers, and gave judgment against the defendants for the amount of the note, with interest and costs. The defendants appealed, and the court of appeals, at May term 1832, affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court of appeals being the highest court of law of the state of Kentucky, in which a decision on the case could be had, and there being drawn in question rights attempted to be derived under a law of a state, impugned on the ground of its repugnance to the constitution of the United States, the case has been removed from the court of appeals of Kentucky to the supreme court of the United States, by writ of error, pursuant to the provisions of the twenty-fifth section of the judiciary act of 1789.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the plaintiffs in error, three points were insisted on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.
