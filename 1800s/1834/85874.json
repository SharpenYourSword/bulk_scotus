The inquisition of the marshal and jurors, returned to the circuit court for the county of Washington, estimated the value of the lands in the warrant mentioned, and all the damages that the owners thereof would sustain by cutting the said canal through the said land, at one thousand dollars. Upon the return of the said warrant, the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company by their counsel, moved the court for an order to have the same affirmed and recorded, unless good cause <span class=\"star-pagination\">*260</span> be shown to the contrary.
