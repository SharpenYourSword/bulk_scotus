The proof is complete, that the mill, the building of which was the consideration of the concession, was commenced in 1818, was in full operation in 1820, and has been kept up ever since.

After granting permission to build a mill on the place designated, the governor adds, 'and this tract not being sufficient,' plainly indicating the tract on which the mill was to be constructed, 'I grant him the equivalent quantity in Cedar Swamp.' The word 'tract' means land, not timber, and the words 'equivalent quantity' refer to the antecedent word 'tract,' and consequently also mean land.

While the grant of the tract is of no effect, he is permitted to use the timber on it.

That made on Pottsburg creek, which was intended for fourteen thousand four hundred acres, actually contains seventeen thousand six hundred and ten, being three thousand two hundred and ten more than was designed. This difference is accounted for, by the fact, that it includes other tracts previously appropriated, and a quantity of land covered with water. The superior court for the district has very properly, in its opinion, disallowed this excess, so far as respects the land covered with water. But after having adjudged the claim to be valid, 'it confirmed and decreed the same to the said claimant, to the extent, and agreeably to the boundaries, as in the grant for the said land, and as in the surveys thereof, made by Andrew Burgevin; provided said surveys do not include a greater quantity of land than sixteen thousand acres.' But the surveys do include a greater quantity, as the petitioner himself states in his petition. This conditional confirmation of the larger survey, according to the exterior boundaries as described in the plat, when the petitioner is confessedly not entitled to all the vacant land lying within those boundaries, is, we think, not to be sustained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court is of opinion, that there is no error in so much of the decree of the superior court for the district of East Florida, made in this case, as declares the claim to be valid, and as confirms the title of the petitioner to the land described in the second survey mentioned in the said decree, containing sixteen hundred acres, made the 26th of November 1824, and doth affirm so much thereof. But this court is of opinion, that there is error in so much of the said decree as confirms the title of the petitioner to the land descirbed in the first survey, made on the 1st day of November 1824, because the said survey is admitted by the petitioner to contain more than fourteen thousand four hundred acres of land not previously granted.

This court doth, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*474</span> therefore, reverse so much of the said decree as confirms the title of the petitioner to the land contained in the said survey, according to the exterior boundaries in the said decree described, and doth remand the cause to the said superior court, with directions to conform its decree to the decree of this court, by ordering the said tract to be so surveyed as to contain fourteen thousand four hundred acres of land not previously granted, and no more.</p>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the superior court for the eastern district of Florida, and was argued by counsel; on consideration whereof, this court is of opinion, that there is no error in so much of the decree of the superior court for the district of East Florida, made in this case, as declares to be valid, and as confirms the title of the petitioner to the land described in the second survey mentioned in the said decree, containing sixteen hundred acres, made the 26th of November 1824; and doth affirm so much thereof. But this court is of opinion, that there is error in so much of the said decree, as confirms the title of the petitioner to the land described in the first survey, made on the 1st day of November 1824, because the said survey is admitted by the petitioner, to contain more than fourteen thousand four hundred acres of land not previously granted. This court doth, therefore, reverse so much of the said decree as confirms the title of the petitioner to the land contained in the said survey, according to the exterior boundaries in the said decree described; and doth remand the cause to the said superior court, with directions to conform its decree to the decree of this court, by ordering the said tract to be so surveyed, as to contain fourteen thousand four hundred acres of land not previously granted, and no more.</p>\n</div>", "id": 85894, "judges": "Marshall", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/85894/", "sha1": "3454b0c36b240e405f54a70e6a6cb008d2d893ef", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T08:59:55"}
