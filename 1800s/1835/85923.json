Chouteau, Gabriel Car e Chouteau, Henry Chouteau, Edward Chouteau, Eulalie Paul and Ren e Paul, husband of said Eulalie, Louise Paul and Gabriel Paul, husband of said Louise, Emilie Smith and Thomas F. Smith, husband of said Emilie, respectfully showeth, that in the year 1799, Auguste A. Chouteau, deceased, late of St Louis, the father of your petitioners, applied to and obtained permission from the government then existing in upper Louisiana, to establish a distillery in or near the town of St Louis, as will more fully appear by the petition and order thereon, dated the 5th of November 1799, and 3d of January 1800, which are herewith shown to the court and prayed to be taken as part of this petition, marked No. 1; that on the 5th day of January 1800, said Auguste Chouteau presented his petition of that date to the lieutenant governor of the province of upper Louisiana, praying that a tract of land containing twelve hundred and eighty-one arpents, superficial measure of Paris, situated near the town of St Louis, bounded on the north by a tract granted to Doctor John Watkins, on the south and on the west by the lands of the third line of concessions, should be granted to the said Auguste Chouteau and his heirs, for the purpose of enabling said Auguste Chouteau to obtain a sufficient supply of fire wood for the distillery aforesaid; that on the same day, to wit, the 5th of January 1800, the said lieutenant governor made his decree conformably to the prayer of said petition, whereby said lieutenant governor directed and ordered that the surveyor of the said province, Don Antonio Soulard, should put the said Auguste Chouteau in possession of the said tract of twelve hundred and eighty-one arpents, in the place indicated and demanded, to the end that said Auguste Chouteau might afterwards obtain the complete title thereto from the governor-general, all which will appear by said petition and decree, now here produced, marked No. 2, and which petition and decree is prayed to be taken as part of this petition; that afterwards, in obedience to said decree, to wit, on the 5th day of March 1801, the said surveyor, Don Antonio Soulard, delivered the possession of said tract to said Auguste, and executed a survey and plat of survey thereof, as will more fully appear by the said plat and certificate of survey, bearing date the 10th of April 1801, now here produced, marked No. 3, and which said plat and certificate were recorded in book A, p. 43, No. 82, in the office of said surveyor, as by reference to the said certificate and to said record in the office of the surveyor of this district will appear; that said decrees so made by said lieutenant governor, were made in pursuance of the special instruction given by the governor-general of Louisiana, Don Manuel Gayoso De Lemos, to said lieutenant governor, to favour and forward the aforesaid undertakings of said Auguste Chouteau, as will appear by the letter of said governor-general, addressed to said Auguste Chouteau, under date the 20th of May 1799, in answer to an application made by said Auguste Chouteau to said governor-general, as will appear by reference to said original letter herewith exhibited, marked No. 4, and prayed to be taken as part of this petition; that, by virtue of said decrees, survey, and delivery of possession, said Auguste occupied and enjoyed said tract, so granted, as the lawful proprietor thereof, from the date of said delivery of possession until the decease of said Auguste Chouteau; that said Auguste, during his life, did, in conformity to the acts of congress in that case made and provided, submit his claim to said tract, derived as aforesaid, to the board of commissioners heretofore created for the settlement and adjudication of French and Spanish land claims in upper Louisiana; that said board rejected said claim on the sole ground that a tract of a league square having been already confirmed to said Auguste Chousteau, the board had not power under the law, as it then stood, to confirm to said Chouteau any greater quantity; and your petitioners show that said board, for the purpose, as it is supposed, of testifying their sense of the merits of said claim, did cause to be indorsed on the back of a document therein exhibited to them, the words 'bona fide,' as will appear, reference being had to said document No. 2, herein before mentioned; your petitioners further show, that said Auguste Chouteau has departed this life, and that previous to his death he made his last will and testament, in due form of law, whereby he devised to your petitioners the said tract of twelve hundred and eighty-one arpents, besides other property, to your petitioners and their heirs, as tenants in common. Wherefore your petitioners pray that said title may be inquired into, and that the same be confirmed, as the same would have been confirmed had not the sovereignty of said province been transferred to the United States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Translation.)

The answer of the district attorney admits nothing, and submits the case to the court on the proof to be made by the petitioners. The erection of the distillery, and the manufacture of spirits to a considerable extent, the apparent motives to the grant, are fully proved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The distinction between the case of Chouteau and others, and that of Delassus, whose title has been confirmed, consists in this. The concession to Delassus was made by the lieutenant governor of upper Louisiana by direction of the governor-general, at a time when the power of granting land was vested in the governors of provinces. This power was transferred to the intendant-general in 1799, after which transfer in 1800, the order of survey under which Chouteau claimed, was made by the lieutenant governor. The validity of the order depends on the authority of the lieutenant governor to make it. Chouteau alleges in support of this authority, that the lieutenant-governor was also sub-delegate, in which character he was empowered to grant incomplete titles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several documents have been laid before the court which satisfy us that the lieutenant governors were, by virtue of their office, sub-delegates. In the record in Soulard's case, which we understand is to be considered as an exhibit in this, a letter from the lieutenant governor Delassus to the surveyor-general is introduced, in which he recites a letter of Morales, the intendant-general, to him, dated the 1st of December 1802; informing him that in consequence of the death of the assessor he had closed the tribunal of affairs and causes relating to grants and confirmations of royal lands. The letter adds: 'I make this communication in order that, apprised of this providence, you may not receive, frame or transmit memorials so-liciting lands until farther orders.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a letter of the 26th of August 1799, addressed by Morales to Don Carlos Dehault Delassus, in which he notices instructions given by Delassus to Roberto M'Kay, in his character of sub-delegate, he observes, 'I must say, that it being contrary to law that one sub-delegate should transfer his powers to another, the instruction given by you cannot, nor ought to have effect; and the more so, as the sub-delegation of the intendancy is local.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a certificate given by Don Gilberto Leonard, treasurer of the army, and Don Manuel Gonzalez Armirez, ministers of the royal treasury, &amp;c. of the province of Louisiana, they certify that in pursuance of a decree of the senior intendant-general ad interim, the senior colonel Charles Dehault Delassus, formerly commandant of the port of New Madrid, and lieutenant governor of St Louis of the Illinois, with the sub-delegation of the royal treasury in both situations, &amp;c.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the claims laid before the commissioners, and confirmed, are several which originated with Delassus after the power of granting lands was transferred from the governor to the intendant-general. This very order of survey was executed by the surveyor-general in 1801. Possession was delivered to Chouteau which was retained by him during his life; and appears to have remained with his devisees since his death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this point the report made by the recorder and commissioners to congress under the act of the 9th of July 1832, and the 2d of March 1833, cannot be disregarded. They speak of the union of the two offices of lieutenant governor and subdelegate, as being universally understood and admitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Charles Dehault Delassus, lieutenant governor of upper Louisiana, whose deposition appears to be annexed to the report of the commissioners, deposes, 'that all the lieutenant governors of upper Louisiana were, in virtue of their offices as lieutenant governors, likewise sub-delegates. That the offices of lieutenant governor and sub-delegate were inseparable.' Morales, immediately after the sale of the royal lands had been transferred to his intendancy, assigns as one reason for issuing his regulations, 'that the commandants, as sub-delegates of the intendancy, may be informed of what they ought to observe.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, as we think must be admitted, Delassus was sub-delegate as well as lieutenant governor, the transfer of the power of granting lands belonging to the royal domain from the governor to the intendant-general, did not affect his power to give the order of survey on which the title of the petitioners depends. That order is the foundation of title, and is, according to the acts of congress and the general understanding and usage of Louisiana and Missouri, capable of being perfected into a complete title. It is property capable of being alienated, of being subjected to debts, and is as such to be held as sacred and inviolate as other property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The power of lieutenant governor Delassus in his character of sub-delegate to make this order of survey being established, all the principles settled in the preceding cases apply to this.

This power was transferred to the intendant-general in 1799, after which transfer in 1800, the order of survey under which Chouteau claimed, was made by the lieutenant governor.

In the record in Soulard's case, which we understand is to be considered as an exhibit in this, a letter from the lieutenant governor Delassus to the surveyor-general is introduced, in which he recites a letter of Morales, the intendant-general, to him, dated the 1st of December 1802; informing him that in consequence of the death of the assessor he had closed the tribunal of affairs and causes relating to grants and confirmations of royal lands. The letter adds: \"I make this communication in order that, apprised of this providence, you may not receive, frame or transmit memorials soliciting lands until farther orders.\"</p>\n<p>In a letter of the 26th of August 1799, addressed by Morales to Don Carlos Dehault Delassus, in which he notices instructions given by Delassus to Roberto M'Kay, in his character of sub-delegate, he observes, \"I must say, that it being contrary to law that one sub-delegate should transfer his powers to another, the instruction given by you cannot, nor ought to have effect; and the more so, as the sub-delegation of the intendancy is local.\"</p>\n<p>In a certificate given by Don Gilberto Leonard, treasurer of the army, and Don Manuel Gonzalez Armirez, ministers of the royal treasury, &amp;c. of the province of Louisiana, they certify that in pursuance of a decree of the senior intendant-general ad interim, the senior colonel Charles Dehault Delassus, formerly commandant of the port of New Madrid, and lieutenant governor of St Louis of the Illinois, with the sub-delegation of the royal treasury in both situations, &amp;c.</p>\n<p>In the claims laid before the commissioners, and confirmed, are several which originated with Delassus after the power of granting lands was transferred from the governor to the intendant-general. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*145</span> This very order of survey was executed by the surveyor-general in 1801.

That order is the foundation of title, and is, according to the acts of congress and the general understanding and usage of Louisiana and Missouri, capable of being perfected into a complete title.
