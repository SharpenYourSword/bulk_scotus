Copies of the papers on which the motion was founded, with notice that the same would be made at this term, had been served on the district judge and the parties in the suit pending before him, during the late vacation. The district judge appeared by counsel, and waived any notice of a rule to show cause, and offered to show cause instanter. An objection having been suggested, whether, even by consent on both sides, the rule and service thereof ought to be dispensed with, some discussion took place on the subject between the bench and the bar.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice BALDWIN was of opinion, that in a cause of this sort, the court ought not to dispense with the regular course of proceedings, by the granting and service of a rule to show cause.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Chief Justice MARSHALL said, that the grant of a rule to show cause and the service thereof, is a matter in the discretion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court may, in its discretion, grant an alternative mandamus, if it deems it more conductive to public justice, and to prevent delays.
