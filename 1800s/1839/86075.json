The answer denies that the said Andrew Burgevin has been prevented from constructing and erecting said mill and proceeding in the objects of said grant, owing to the general disturbed and unsettled state of the country; and farther, if any such disturbed and unsettled state of the country at any time existed, it was merely temporary, and of very short continuance; whereas, more than eleven years have elapsed (as appears by the showing of the said Andrew Burgevin himself) since the date of the said supposed grant; during any part of which period he might, with due and reasonable diligence, have proceeded to erect and construct the said water sawmill on the said tract of land, in accordance with the objects of said supposed grant.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Superior Court of East Florida gave a decree in favour of the petitioner, and the United States prosecuted this appeal.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was argued by Mr. Grundy, Attorney General of the United States, and Mr. Dent for the appellant; and by Coxe for the appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Dent for the United States cited The United States <i>vs.</i> Mills's heirs, 12 Peters, 215. The United States <i>vs.</i> Kingsley, 12 Peters, 476. The question before the Court in these cases was precisely the same as that in the present case; and this Court refused to confirm the grant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court has said it will apply the most liberal rules of equity to the condition of Spanish grants; but in this case there is no room for the application of any such rules. The grantee has not performed the condition of the grant; nor did he during all the period which passed after the grant, make an attempt to perform it.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the United States <i>vs.</i> Kingsley the same excuse for the non-performance was offered: 'the disturbed state of the country;' and it was overruled. This grant was made within six months of the cession of Florida to the United States. This Court has allowed six months for the performance of such conditions; and by the Spanish law the same period was allowed.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coxe for the appellee contended, that the disturbed situation of the country, by Indians, prevented the erection of the mill contemplated by the grantee. He cited Huidek oper <i>vs.</i> Douglass, 1 Wash. C. C. R. 258.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General, in reply, stated that if this grant should be confirmed, there would be no limitation to claims for lands in Florida. There was a proposition to erect a water sawmill on the land; and the Governor of Florida declared the grant should be void, if the mill should not be erected.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice WAYNE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of the Eastern District of Florida, confirming the right of the appellee to a tract of land under a concession or grant from the Governor of Florida, dated before the treaty of the 22d February, 1819, between the United States and Spain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the concession or grant identical with that in Kingsley's case, in 12 Peters, 476; and that it is controlled by the principles laid down by the Court in that case.
