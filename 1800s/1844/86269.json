The distinction constantly maintained is this: Where the plaintiff sues for an amount exceeding $2000, and the <i>ad damnum</i> exceeds $2000, if by reason of any erroneous ruling of the court below, the plaintiff recovers nothing, or less than $2000, there, the sum claimed by the plaintiff is the sum in controversy for which a writ of error will lie. But if a verdict is given against the defendant for a less sum than $2000, and judgment passes against him accordingly, there it is obvious that there is, on the part of the defendant, nothing in controversy beyond the sum for which the judgment is given; and consequently he is not entitled to any writ of error.
