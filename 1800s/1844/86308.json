He then read affidavits to show that personal access to Dorr was denied, in consequence of which his authority could not be obtained for an application for such a writ. The present motion for a <i>habeas corpus</i> was based upon this fact. There was no other mode of ascertaining whether or not it was Dorr's wish that his case should be brought up to this court. Under the 14th section of the Judiciary Act, the power to issue writs of <i>habeas corpus</i> was vested in the judges of the United States' courts. 3 Story's Com. tit.
