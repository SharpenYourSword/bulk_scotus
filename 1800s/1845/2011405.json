The note was for $537 27 cents, and the damages in the declaration laid at one thousand dollars. There was a verdict and judgment for the sum of $750 36 cents, and it is upon this judgment that the writ of error is brought.</p>\n<p>The matter in dispute is below the amount necessary to give jurisdiction to this court, and the writ of error must therefore be dismissed.</p>\n</div>",
