The note was for $537 27 cents, and the damages in the declaration laid at one thousand dollars. There was a verdict and judgment for the sum of $750 36 cents, and it is upon this judgment that the writ of error is brought.</p>\n<p>The matter in dispute is below the amount necessary to give jurisdiction to this court, and the writ of error must therefore be dismissed.</p>\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "", "id": 2011405, "judges": "", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2011405/", "sha1": "bf0fcfc2c29a709c7585957eb349e95de085e1c4", "source": "L", "time_retrieved": "2013-10-30T01:02:42.438697"}
