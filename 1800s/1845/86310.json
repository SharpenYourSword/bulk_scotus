Some of these duties were paid under protest in writing, and some without any written protest or notice, but evidence was offered for the purpose of showing that the defendants in error verbally notified the collector that the duties charged on all of these goods would be contested.

To this direction the plaintiff in error excepted; and it is upon this point only that the case comes before this court.</p>\n<p>The only object of the notice was to warn the collector that the party meant to hold him personally responsible for the money, whether he paid it over or not.
