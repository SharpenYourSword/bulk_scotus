There appears to be no issue, no <i>venire</i>, no jury empanelled or sworn, no verdict, except where it is incidentally mentioned, no bill of exceptions signed, no judgment of the court for a specific sum. It is true, that there is a verdict spoken of in the docket entries, but these are only to refresh the memory of the clerk. 10 Ohio Rep. 200.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing is a part of the record except the pleadings, or what is referred to in the opinion of the court. 5 Peters, 254.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no regular judgment of the court for a specific sum. How could an action of debt or a <i>scire facias</i> be maintained upon such a record? 5 Dane's Abr. 221; 1 Arkansas Rep. 346, 347; 2 Arkansas Rep. 390; 1 Robinson's Practice, 390; 6 Randolph, 30-32; 4 Munford, 262; Yelverton, 107; 4 Leonard, 61; 1 Chitty's Plead. 356.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The declaration is radically defective. The first count was abandoned, and judgment entered on the second count. This must therefore stand alone, and, taken by itself, it discloses no cause of action. Two reasons exist for this. 1. There is nothing stated from which an implied undertaking can be inferred to carry safely. 2. There is no such express undertaking averred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. In order to raise the implication, the fact must be averred, that the other party were common carriers. This is necessary, as a foundation for the implied assumpsit. 1 Wendell, 272; 6 J. B.

As to the declaration. It may be alleged that the first count is bad, and that the verdict, being general on both counts, is thereby vitiated. The reply is:&#8212;1. The count is not bad. It provides for the event of no special damage being made out. It would, at least, justify nominal damages. It alleges that the defendants were engaged in a duty to the public as carriers of passengers; that they undertook to carry the plaintiff safely, and failed to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, it is to be remembered that there was no demurrer to the count, and the objection therefore comes after verdict. Now it is a familiar rule, that a cause of action defectively or inaccurately set forth is cured by the verdict, because, to entitle the plaintiff to recover, all circumstances necessary, in form or in substance, to make out his cause of action, so imperfectly stated, must be proved at the trial. (9 Wheat. 595; 1 Peters's C. C. R. 482.) But, 2. This inquiry is unnecessary, as the judgment is entered on the second count. The recent case of Matthewson's Administrators <i>v.</i> Grant's Administrator, in this court (2 Howard, 263), renders superfluous any argument as to the right and the duty of the court to permit the amendment prayed for. The second count is the familiar one in case, not requiring any averment of the payment of money, found in 2 Chitty's Pleadings, 647 (ed. of 1840), and in 2 Chitty's Precedents, 506, <i>a</i> (ed. of 1839), and was pursued in Curtis <i>v.</i> Drinkwater, 2 Barn. and Adolph. 169 (22 English C. L. Rep. 51). Had such averment been necessary, the omission would be cured after verdict, on the principle heretofore noticed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second. As to any irregularities committed by the jury in making up their verdict, they are not examinable in a court of error. 1 Peters's C. C. R. 159. All these matters are referred to the sound discretion of the court below. The refusal to grant a new trial is not the subject of a writ of error. 4 Wheat. 223; 6 Wheat. 547.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing, however, can be better settled, than that the Circuit Court was right in refusing to act upon the affidavit of a juror. 2 Tidd's Pr. 709; Vaise <i>v.</i> Delaval, 1 T. R. 11; Owen <i>v.</i> Warburton, 4 Bos. &amp; Pull. 326; 4 Wash. C. C. R. 32; 4 Binn. 150; 5 Conn. R. 348; 3 Gill and Johns. 473; 2 Greenleaf, 41; 2 Tyler's Verm. R. 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the process resorted to by the jury is not open to just exception, even if established by unexceptionable evidence, see Grinnell <i>v.</i> Phillips, 1 Mass. R. 541; Commonwealth <i>v.</i> Drew, 4 Mass. R. 399; Goodwin <i>v.</i> Philips, Lofft, 71; Lawrence <i>v.</i> Boswell, Sayer, 100.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third. As to the instructions prayed for by the counsel of the defendants below, and refused by the court. The late lamented Judge Baldwin delivered in this case an elaborate and comprehensive charge to the jury, in which the law, as settled by this court in Stokes <i>v.</i> Saltonstall, 13 Peters, 181, was clearly laid down and enforced. Unfortunately it cannot now be found. <i>To this charge no exception was taken</i>. It covered the whole ground, and the learned judge might well, therefore, have refused to notice any of the points submitted by defendants' counsel. This course was pursued by the circuit judge in the trial of Stokes <i>v.</i> Saltonstall (see 13 Peters, 185). Judge Baldwin, however, thought proper to yield his assent to the points submitted, so far as he could do so with propriety. His answers to these points, apart from the general charge, established the following rules for the guidance of the jury:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. That the proprietors of a stagecoach do not warrant the safety of their passengers in the character of common carriers; and that they are not responsible for mere accidents to the persons of passengers, but only for the want of due care. (Jury so instructed in conformity to the first proposition submitted by the defendants below.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. That they do not warrant the safety of passengers; their undertaking as to them goes no further than this, that as far as human wisdom and vigilance can go, they will provide for the safe conveyance of their passengers. (Jury so instructed in conformity to the second proposition submitted by defendants below.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. If the jury believe that the driver was a person of competent skill, of good habits, and in every respect qualified and suitably prepared for the business in which he was engaged, plaintiff cannot recover unless they were <i>clearly satisfied</i> that, on this occasion the disaster was <i>attributable to the fault of the driver</i>, and <i>not</i> to the darkness of the night or other accidental cause, <i>and that said accident would not have occurred but for the fault of the driver</i>. (Jury so instructed in conformity to the seventh proposition submitted by the defendants below.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>other</i> propositions submitted are either inconsistent with what was conceded by the defendants themselves to be correct doctrine, or present parts of the subject in a detached, isolated form, calculated to mislead rather than enlighten the jury. Thus the third and fourth propositions ask the court to declare, that although the grossest negligence and incapacity existed on this particular occasion, yet if the driver's past conduct and character had been good, the proprietors were not liable. To have so held would have been in defiance of the decision of the Supreme Court in Stokes <i>v.</i> Saltonstall (13 Peters, 181), and would have been inconsistent with the court's assent to the defendant's seventh proposition, where good conduct on the particular occasion is conceded to be indispensable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fifth proposition presents a hypothetical statement of facts, and asks the court to instruct the jury that their existence would free the defendants from liability. It is denied that any right exists to force upon the court teasing and endless repetition of points favorable to one or the other side, where the law has been once correctly stated. But here, to have answered the question affirmatively would have been palpably wrong, for all the circumstances mentioned might be true, and yet the disaster have been occasioned by the intoxication of the driver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So of the sixth proposition. It is to be borne in mind that the court instructed the jury that plaintiff could not recover, 'unless they were clearly satisfied that on this occasion <i>the disaster was altributable</i> <i>to the fault of the driver</i>, and <i>not</i> to the darkness of the night, <i>or other accidental cause</i>, and that said accident would not have occurred <i>but for the fault of the driver</i>.' The question, therefore, was fully answered, without entering into an idle and unseemly dissertation on the several stages of drunkenness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Coxe</i>, for plaintiffs in error, in reply and conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the errors in pleading which will lead to a reversal, see 9 Wheat. 720.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case there is no plea, and of course no replication; docket entries are no part of the record. 10 Ohio Rep. 200; 5 Peters, 254; <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></span>, 119.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Coxe</i> then went into a critical examination of the record.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever would be fatal in the court below is also fatal in the court above. 6 Cranch, 221; 15 Johns. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the first count be taken away, the second, standing by itself, does not afford sufficient foundation for the judgment. For example, it speaks of a 'day and year aforesaid,' but no day is named. It speaks of 'passengers in a coach,' but it is not averred to be a public coach. If the contract is to be implied, the fact that the stages were public must be averred. The declaration says that the defendants did not perform their duty. How? Was the plaintiff left behind? Or was the driver negligent? The second count does not say.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the cause of action is inaccurately set out, the defect is cured by verdict; but a mere allegation of omission of duty is not enough. The case must show the facts. 2 Cranch, 389.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title to property must be alleged.

That the judgment below was rendered for the plaintiff, on the second count of the declaration; and it is insisted that this count is so defective, that no judgment could be rendered on it; and therefore on error the judgment must be reversed. If the assumption be true, the consequence must follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second count refers to the first for the dates of the circumstances, and the injury complained of, and as no time is given in the first count, neither has this any.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff in error having pleaded not guilty and gone to trial, the presumption is that the proof supplied the defective statement. Such, we suppose, is the uniform rule, where material dates are left blank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. It is insisted that the declaration does not set out the payment of any passage money; nor any promise or undertaking on the part of the defendants below to carry the plaintiff safely. The allegation is, that the plaintiff, at the special instance and request of the defendants, became and was a passenger in a certain coach, to be carried safely, &amp;c., for certain rewards to the defendants; and thereupon it was their duty to use due and proper care, that the plaintiff should be safely conveyed. The breach is well assigned, as it shows the neglect and consequent injury sustained. No demurrer was interposed, for want of form; and this brings the 32d section of the Judiciary Act of 1789 to bear on the proceeding. Not guilty, was pleaded; a trial had on the issue, on which the jury returned a verdict in these words:&#8212;'Harriet Bishop <i>v.</i> Stockton, Moore, &amp; Co. We, the jurors sworn and empanelled in this cause, do find for the plaintiff six thousand five hundred dollars, with costs of suit, this 25th day of November, A. D. 1843.' The verdict was received by the court, and stands recorded as found; and afterwards, on motion, it was amended so as to apply to the second count only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Who the jurors were, or how many found the verdict, does not appear; nor does it appear that they were sworn to try the issue, further than the jury say in their verdict. Still we are bound to presume in favor of proceedings in a court having jurisdiction of the parties and subject-matter, that justice was administered in the ordinary form, when so much appears as is found in this imperfect record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The declaration, plea, and finding must be taken together; and from these, we are bound, by the 32d section, above cited, to ascertain whether, according to the right of 'the cause and matter in law,' the plaintiff is entitled to her damages; and in so doing, defects of form must be disregarded. Why Congress so provided, in 1789, is obvious. No modes of proceeding were prescribed by the act, in civil causes, at common law, and the modes observed in the English courts left to apply as general rules. These were formal and technical; and forasmuch as by the 35th section all parties to causes in courts of the United States might plead and manage their own causes personally, if they saw proper, technicalities could not be required. That the practice under this privilege has not corresponded to the theory tolerating it may be conceded; yet we cannot for this reason disregard the clause covering jeofails, intended for its protection; and if proceedings, as recorded, in the courts in any part of the Union were as loose in 1789 as this record indicates them yet to be, in one circuit court at least, where the two acts of 1789 continue to govern, it must be admitted that Congress acted wisely in declaring that no litigant party should lose his right in law for want of form; and in going one step further, as Congress unquestionably has done, by declaring, that, to save the party's rights, the substance should be infringed on to some extent, when contrasted with modes of proceeding in the English courts, and with their ideas of what is substance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to 'the right of the cause and matter of law' appearing to us on the pleadings and verdict, we think the plaintiff is entitled to her damages, and that judgment below ought to have been rendered for her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the judgment there given is also assailed, and justly, as being less formal than what precedes it. It is either no judgment, or binding. If it amounts to nothing, then, by the 22d section of the Judiciary Act, no writ of error lay (as one can only be prosecuted on a final judgment), and the case must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction, and the plaintiffs in error be sent to the court below, to quash the execution. We think, however, there was a judgment on the verdict, that warranted an execution for the damages found; and consequently the prosecution of a writ of error. And this being so, for the reason above stated, such judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

There appears to be no issue, no <i>venire</i>, no jury empanelled or sworn, no verdict, except where it is incidentally mentioned, no bill of exceptions signed, no judgment of the court for a specific sum. It is true, that there is a verdict spoken of in the docket entries, but these are only to refresh the memory of the clerk. 10 Ohio Rep. 200.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing is a part of the record except the pleadings, or what is referred to in the opinion of the court. 5 Peters, 254.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no regular judgment of the court for a specific sum. How could an action of debt or a <i>scire facias</i> be maintained upon such a record? 5 Dane's Abr. 221; 1 Arkansas Rep. 346, 347; 2 Arkansas Rep. 390; 1 Robinson's Practice, 390; 6 Randolph, 30-32; 4 Munford, 262; Yelverton, 107; 4 Leonard, 61; 1 Chitty's Plead. 356.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The declaration is radically defective. The first count was abandoned, and judgment entered on the second count. This must therefore stand alone, and, taken by itself, it discloses no cause of action. Two reasons exist for this. 1.

There is no such express undertaking averred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. In order to raise the implication, the fact must be averred, that the other party were common carriers. This is necessary, as a foundation for the implied assumpsit. 1 Wendell, 272; 6 J. B.

As to the declaration. It may be alleged that the first count is bad, and that the verdict, being general on both counts, is thereby vitiated. The reply is:&#8212;1. The count is not bad. It provides for the event of no special damage being made out. It would, at least, justify nominal damages. It alleges that the defendants were engaged in a duty to the public as carriers of passengers; that they undertook to carry the plaintiff safely, and failed to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, it is to be remembered that there was no demurrer to the count, and the objection therefore comes after verdict. Now it is a familiar rule, that a cause of action defectively or inaccurately set forth is cured by the verdict, because, to entitle the plaintiff to recover, all circumstances necessary, in form or in substance, to make out his cause of action, so imperfectly stated, must be proved at the trial. (9 Wheat. 595; 1 Peters's C. C. R. 482.) But, 2. This inquiry is unnecessary, as the judgment is entered on the second count. The recent case of Matthewson's Administrators <i>v.</i> Grant's Administrator, in this court (2 Howard, 263), renders superfluous any argument as to the right and the duty of the court to permit the amendment prayed for. The second count is the familiar one in case, not requiring any averment of the payment of money, found in 2 Chitty's Pleadings, 647 (ed. of 1840), and in 2 Chitty's Precedents, 506, <i>a</i> (ed. of 1839), and was pursued in Curtis <i>v.</i> Drinkwater, 2 Barn. and Adolph. 169 (22 English C. L. Rep. 51). Had such averment been necessary, the omission would be cured after verdict, on the principle heretofore noticed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second. As to any irregularities committed by the jury in making up their verdict, they are not examinable in a court of error. 1 Peters's C. C. R. 159. All these matters are referred to the sound discretion of the court below. The refusal to grant a new trial is not the subject of a writ of error. 4 Wheat. 223; 6 Wheat. 547.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing, however, can be better settled, than that the Circuit Court was right in refusing to act upon the affidavit of a juror. 2 Tidd's Pr. 709; Vaise <i>v.</i> Delaval, 1 T. R. 11; Owen <i>v.</i> Warburton, 4 Bos. &amp; Pull. 326; 4 Wash. C. C. R. 32; 4 Binn. 150; 5 Conn. R. 348; 3 Gill and Johns. 473; 2 Greenleaf, 41; 2 Tyler's Verm. R. 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the process resorted to by the jury is not open to just exception, even if established by unexceptionable evidence, see Grinnell <i>v.</i> Phillips, 1 Mass. R. 541; Commonwealth <i>v.</i> Drew, 4 Mass. R. 399; Goodwin <i>v.</i> Philips, Lofft, 71; Lawrence <i>v.</i> Boswell, Sayer, 100.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third. As to the instructions prayed for by the counsel of the defendants below, and refused by the court. The late lamented Judge Baldwin delivered in this case an elaborate and comprehensive charge to the jury, in which the law, as settled by this court in Stokes <i>v.</i> Saltonstall, 13 Peters, 181, was clearly laid down and enforced. Unfortunately it cannot now be found. <i>To this charge no exception was taken</i>. It covered the whole ground, and the learned judge might well, therefore, have refused to notice any of the points submitted by defendants' counsel. This course was pursued by the circuit judge in the trial of Stokes <i>v.</i> Saltonstall (see 13 Peters, 185). Judge Baldwin, however, thought proper to yield his assent to the points submitted, so far as he could do so with propriety. His answers to these points, apart from the general charge, established the following rules for the guidance of the jury:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. That the proprietors of a stagecoach do not warrant the safety of their passengers in the character of common carriers; and that they are not responsible for mere accidents to the persons of passengers, but only for the want of due care. (Jury so instructed in conformity to the first proposition submitted by the defendants below.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. That they do not warrant the safety of passengers; their undertaking as to them goes no further than this, that as far as human wisdom and vigilance can go, they will provide for the safe conveyance of their passengers. (Jury so instructed in conformity to the second proposition submitted by defendants below.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. If the jury believe that the driver was a person of competent skill, of good habits, and in every respect qualified and suitably prepared for the business in which he was engaged, plaintiff cannot recover unless they were <i>clearly satisfied</i> that, on this occasion the disaster was <i>attributable to the fault of the driver</i>, and <i>not</i> to the darkness of the night or other accidental cause, <i>and that said accident would not have occurred but for the fault of the driver</i>. (Jury so instructed in conformity to the seventh proposition submitted by the defendants below.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>other</i> propositions submitted are either inconsistent with what was conceded by the defendants themselves to be correct doctrine, or present parts of the subject in a detached, isolated form, calculated to mislead rather than enlighten the jury. Thus the third and fourth propositions ask the court to declare, that although the grossest negligence and incapacity existed on this particular occasion, yet if the driver's past conduct and character had been good, the proprietors were not liable. To have so held would have been in defiance of the decision of the Supreme Court in Stokes <i>v.</i> Saltonstall (13 Peters, 181), and would have been inconsistent with the court's assent to the defendant's seventh proposition, where good conduct on the particular occasion is conceded to be indispensable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fifth proposition presents a hypothetical statement of facts, and asks the court to instruct the jury that their existence would free the defendants from liability. It is denied that any right exists to force upon the court teasing and endless repetition of points favorable to one or the other side, where the law has been once correctly stated. But here, to have answered the question affirmatively would have been palpably wrong, for all the circumstances mentioned might be true, and yet the disaster have been occasioned by the intoxication of the driver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So of the sixth proposition. It is to be borne in mind that the court instructed the jury that plaintiff could not recover, 'unless they were clearly satisfied that on this occasion <i>the disaster was altributable</i> <i>to the fault of the driver</i>, and <i>not</i> to the darkness of the night, <i>or other accidental cause</i>, and that said accident would not have occurred <i>but for the fault of the driver</i>.' The question, therefore, was fully answered, without entering into an idle and unseemly dissertation on the several stages of drunkenness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Coxe</i>, for plaintiffs in error, in reply and conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the errors in pleading which will lead to a reversal, see 9 Wheat. 720.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case there is no plea, and of course no replication; docket entries are no part of the record. 10 Ohio Rep. 200; 5 Peters, 254; 12 Wheat. 118, 119.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Coxe</i> then went into a critical examination of the record.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever would be fatal in the court below is also fatal in the court above. 6 Cranch, 221; 15 Johns. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the first count be taken away, the second, standing by itself, does not afford sufficient foundation for the judgment. For example, it speaks of a 'day and year aforesaid,' but no day is named. It speaks of 'passengers in a coach,' but it is not averred to be a public coach. If the contract is to be implied, the fact that the stages were public must be averred. The declaration says that the defendants did not perform their duty. How? Was the plaintiff left behind? Or was the driver negligent?

There is no bill of exceptions in the record; although instructions said to have been given by the court to the jury are certified up as part of the proceedings. These of course we cannot notice. Other supposed errors are therefore relied on as sufficient to reverse the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. That the judgment below was rendered for the plaintiff, on the second count of the declaration; and it is insisted that this count is so defective, that no judgment could be rendered on it; and therefore on error the judgment must be reversed.

It is insisted that the declaration does not set out the payment of any passage money; nor any promise or undertaking on the part of the defendants below to carry the plaintiff safely. The allegation is, that the plaintiff, at the special instance and request of the defendants, became and was a passenger in a certain coach, to be carried safely, &amp;c., for certain rewards to the defendants; and thereupon it was their duty to use due and proper care, that the plaintiff should be safely conveyed. The breach is well assigned, as it shows the neglect and consequent injury sustained. No demurrer was interposed, for want of form; and this brings the 32d section of the Judiciary Act of 1789 to bear on the proceeding. Not guilty, was pleaded; a trial had on the issue, on which the jury returned a verdict in these words:&#8212;'Harriet Bishop <i>v.</i> Stockton, Moore, &amp; Co. We, the jurors sworn and empanelled in this cause, do find for the plaintiff six thousand five hundred dollars, with costs of suit, this 25th day of November, A. D. 1843.' The verdict was received by the court, and stands recorded as found; and afterwards, on motion, it was amended so as to apply to the second count only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Who the jurors were, or how many found the verdict, does not appear; nor does it appear that they were sworn to try the issue, further than the jury say in their verdict. Still we are bound to presume in favor of proceedings in a court having jurisdiction of the parties and subject-matter, that justice was administered in the ordinary form, when so much appears as is found in this imperfect record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The declaration, plea, and finding must be taken together; and from these, we are bound, by the 32d section, above cited, to ascertain whether, according to the right of 'the cause and matter in law,' the plaintiff is entitled to her damages; and in so doing, defects of form must be disregarded. Why Congress so provided, in 1789, is obvious. No modes of proceeding were prescribed by the act, in civil causes, at common law, and the modes observed in the English courts left to apply as general rules. These were formal and technical; and forasmuch as by the 35th section all parties to causes in courts of the United States might plead and manage their own causes personally, if they saw proper, technicalities could not be required. That the practice under this privilege has not corresponded to the theory tolerating it may be conceded; yet we cannot for this reason disregard the clause covering jeofails, intended for its protection; and if proceedings, as recorded, in the courts in any part of the Union were as loose in 1789 as this record indicates them yet to be, in one circuit court at least, where the two acts of 1789 continue to govern, it must be admitted that Congress acted wisely in declaring that no litigant party should lose his right in law for want of form; and in going one step further, as Congress unquestionably has done, by declaring, that, to save the party's rights, the substance should be infringed on to some extent, when contrasted with modes of proceeding in the English courts, and with their ideas of what is substance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to 'the right of the cause and matter of law' appearing to us on the pleadings and verdict, we think the plaintiff is entitled to her damages, and that judgment below ought to have been rendered for her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the judgment there given is also assailed, and justly, as being less formal than what precedes it. It is either no judgment, or binding. If it amounts to nothing, then, by the 22d section of the Judiciary Act, no writ of error lay (as one can only be prosecuted on a final judgment), and the case must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction, and the plaintiffs in error be sent to the court below, to quash the execution. We think, however, there was a judgment on the verdict, that warranted an execution for the damages found; and consequently the prosecution of a writ of error. And this being so, for the reason above stated, such judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
