At the November term of the District Court, 1847, a decree was entered in favor of the petitioners, and at the same term an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States was granted by the District Court, on the application of the defendants. An appeal thus allowed requires no notice to the appellee. A motion is now made to dismiss this appeal, on the following grounds: \u0097</p>\n<p>1. Because the appeal is not made to any specified term of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>2. Because it is not made returnable to the term of the Supreme Court next following the decree.</p>\n<p>3.

On the 14th of March, 1848, a transcript of the record was made out, and it was filed in this court at the present term. From the time this decree was entered, to the commencement of the ensuing session of the Supreme Court, there were less than thirty days.
