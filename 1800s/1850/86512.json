Wharton and Mr. Dallas, for the defendant in error.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*101</span> Mr. Justice WOODBURY delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>This is a writ of error, presenting three distinct grounds of exception to the judgment rendered in the court below.</p>\n<p>Neither of these is claimed to justify us in revising the finding of the jury on the evidence, though the verdict was not acceptable in some respects to the district judge who tried the cause, but should have been scrutinized by him, if at all, and, if clearly wrong, submitted to another jury for correction on the motion for a new trial. The exceptions to be now considered are, therefore, confined to the instructions given to the jury concerning the claims made in set-off by the original defendant, and are, that they all were, in point of law, incorrect.</p>\n<p>Those claims were, \u0097</p>\n<p>1st. For commissions for drawing bills of exchange.</p>\n<p>2d. For commissions on payments made to mechanics and laborers at the navy-yard at Pensacola.</p>\n<p>3d. For loss of commissions on sales of slops, and loss by depreciation of property in the Pacific.</p>\n<p>The claim for commissions for drawing bills of exchange is founded on such service, performed at times from May, 1827, to February, 1830. But it appears that such commissions were not, at any period, usually allowed to permanent pursers. And though one or two instances were given of such allowances under peculiar circumstances, they were limited <span class=\"star-pagination\">*102</span> to that number; and on the 10th of November, 1826, commissions to commanders of squadrons, and \"officers of any grade,\" for drawing such bills, were expressly abolished. (Red Book in the Navy, p. 10 and p. 27. See also Letter of 4th Auditor, 26th June, 1844; Circular, 1st April, 1833.)</p>\n<p>When the present claim was presented to the department by Mr. Buchanan, in 1831, it was, therefore, rejected, and seems to have been abandoned by him for nearly ten years after, when, another difficulty arising as to other transactions of his in the Pacific, this claim was revived, and offered in set-off to a suit by the government for moneys then recently advanced to him.</p>\n<p>On what ground, then, could the district judge properly leave its allowance to the jury, as he did at the trial in this case? It seems to us, that he should have instructed them that, in point of law, neither any act of Congress, nor any regulation of the department, justified the allowance; that the service performed was an ordinary one, connected with a purser's official duties, and consequently, for which, in point of law, he was entitled to no extra compensation by way of commissions or otherwise. (See Gratiot v. United States, 4 How. 112.)</p>\n<p>The two cases, often relied on to justify such an allowance, were both claims for what was deemed by the court extra service. (United States v. McDaniel, and United States v. Fillebrown, 7 Pet. 16 and 28.)</p>\n<p>On the subject of a usage or custom, attempted to be proved, to overturn these principles and decisions, it seems to us that the judge should have ruled, that a usage ought not to be permitted to be set up, where a rule, as here, is not doubtful, but settled. (Brown v. Jackson, 2 Wash. C.C. 24; 6 Binney, 417.) And that a usage or custom, when admissible, must, in order to be valid, be ancient, reasonable, and generally known, (3 Wash. C.C. 149,) and also be certain (United States v. Duval, Gilpin, 372). Consequently, when it appeared here that the compensation was fixed or clear, and when it appeared that only one, or, at the furthest, two extra allowances could be proved of commissions for such services by permanent pursers, and those under peculiar circumstances, he should have directed that, in point of law, these last did not constitute a valid usage or custom, and that there was nothing properly to be left to the jury on the subject. In the United States v. McDaniel, 7 Pet. 16, the usage had existed uninterruptedly for fifteen years.</p>\n<p>There is a very good description of a custom or usage in ch. 1, art. 3, of the Civil Code of Louisiana: \u0097 \"Customs result <span class=\"star-pagination\">*103</span> from a long series of actions, constantly repeated, which have, by such repetition and by uninterrupted acquiescence, acquired the force of a tacit and common consent.\" How imperfectly the evidence in the present case meets the requirements of such a definition as this, or of any legal view of a valid usage, is so obvious as not to need further explanation.</p>\n<p>The second claim, for paying mechanics and laborers at the navy-yard at Pensacola, from 1835 to 1837, stands in a similar condition. It was a service expressly imposed on a purser of a yard as official, by the Blue Book of the navy, as early as 1818 (p. 14).</p>\n<p>But the judge instructed the jury, that this book had ceased to be in force. In this he erred. For the Navy Department, in 1831, had expressly and officially published, that it was still \"in full force,\" except in two or three other particulars, specified in a note to the Red Book (p. 49, note). The latter, also, was then first printed, and not only did not profess to repeal the former, but such was not its legal effect. The Blue Book related chiefly to other matters than what were in the Red Book, and which were as necessarily to remain regulated by the former after the publication of the latter as before, and even now as then.</p>\n<p>The Blue Book concerns the complement of officers and men for vessels of different sizes, the duties of those officers on shipboard and at yards, salutes, recruiting, &amp;c.; and not, like the Red Book, relating to decisions in the civil administration of the department, and circulars, orders, &amp;c., connected with it.</p>\n<p>The latter was a mere collection of these latter matters, before existing dispersed and in manuscript; and being compiled and printed for the benefit of navy officers, as well as the department, the date of each decision and circular was given, so that officers might see, if decisions, regulations, or circulars conflicted in any degree, as they sometimes might, which was of most recent date, and consequently often modifying or superseding one made earlier. The Red Book introduced nothing new into the service, nor professed to do it, but merely arranged and made more generally known by printing, in 1831, what had before taken place on the matters described in it, as had been done in relation to some matters in the Blue Book, by printing and distributing that in 1818, as well as compiling and publishing in that other things new and permanently useful.</p>\n<p>There being, then, no repeal of this part of the Blue Book relating to the duties of pursers at yards, the payment of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*104</span> mechanics and laborers stood, as ever since 1818, if not longer, an official duty of pursers stationed at them.</p>\n<p>The idea of attempting to set up a usage to pay commissions for this service, and leave merely one case of the kind to the jury as evidence of such a usage, was altogether untenable on sound principles, as before shown under the first claim. All the other cases referred to in support of such a usage or custom were not cases to allow commissions, though sometimes to sanction a sum of money for a clerk.</p>\n<p>But even this last had been abolished as early as 1826, long before the service performed by the original defendant, and only an additional steward had been since allowed at yards where the workmen were numerous. (Red Book, 52. See Letter of 4th Auditor, June 26, 1844, and Circular of 1st April, 1833.)</p>\n<p>There is, likewise, another defect in the instructions to the jury on both of these points, in permitting the testimony of naval officers, and sometimes of subordinate ones, rather than the head of the department, to go to the jury to enable them to decide what were and were not official duties, when it was rather the province of the court, after being duly informed from proper sources, to settle that as a question of law, and direct the jury upon it. (4 How. 80; 6 Binney, 417.)</p>\n<p>The third ground of claim, and the instructions upon it, are in some respects different, and remain to be considered.</p>\n<p>This claim was for commissions lost on the sale of slops and for depreciation in property, caused by orders of Commodore Claxton in the Pacific in 1839.</p>\n<p>The latter, finding that an unusual quantity of some kinds of clothing had been issued by the defendant from his private stores, on which an advance of twenty-five per cent. had been charged, and only a small quantity from the public stores, on which only ten per cent. advance was charged, interposed and issued an order against taxing the crew over ten per cent. advance on certain articles of wearing apparel, on which the defendant insisted he was entitled to twenty-five. This claim is for a loss of the difference between ten and twenty-five per cent. on what was and might have been sold, and loss by depreciation on articles not sold. Considering the views entertained by this court on the impropriety in law of allowing this claim to be put in at all in set-off to this action, it is not necessary to decide here which percentage was the proper one.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, the opinion of the Commodore was sustained by that of Mr. Paulding, then Secretary of the Navy, \u0097 presumed to be best acquainted with the previous constructions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*105</span> in the Navy Department, \u0097 and by the express language of the Blue Book (pp. 103 and 105), and by some early decisions published in the Red Book (p. 18), as well as by the views of some of the members of this court; yet other constructions of these decisions tend to sustain the claim, as do the views of other members of this court.</p>\n<p>Whichever of these constructions, then, may be correct, is not now settled, because we think it clear, that such a claim as this is not allowable at all by way of set-off to an action brought by the government.</p>\n<p>The statute of March 3d, 1797, which allows set-offs, has had a very liberal construction by this court, extending it to matters even distinct from the cause of action, if only such as the defendant is entitled to a credit on, whether equitable or legal. (United States v. Wilkins, 6 Wheat. 135; Ripley v. United States, 7 Pet. 25.)</p>\n<p>The object is to settle between the parties their mutual accounts or debts. (See the Act of Congress.)</p>\n<p>But any wrongs or torts done, and any unliquidated damages claimed, have never been permitted as a set-off. (Butts v. Collins, 13 Wend. 156; McDonald v. Neilson, 2 Cow. 140; Heck v. Sheener, 4 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 249; 10 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 14.) This rule prevails when the United States are plaintiffs, as well as individuals. (United States v. Robeson, 9 Pet. 325.)</p>\n<p>Much less could wrongs done by others than the United States, and for whom it would be a very grave question whether the United States were in law responsible, be set off, and unliquidated damages allowed.</p>\n<p>Such a transaction, whether sounding ex delicto or ex contractu, seems to be one between the two officers, rather than between one of them and the government. (United States v. Hawkins, 10 Pet. 134; 9 Pet. 319.)</p>\n<p>It is certain, that no action could technically be sustained against the United States for any wrong done here by Commodore Claxton. And, waiving their sovereignty to bar a suit, it is quite manifest that no claim exists as a matter of course against the government for a wrong done by one officer against another officer, or by one officer against an individual, when the liability of the officer himself for public acts is often questionable; and when the liability of the government for his acts, private or public, is still more in doubt. (Garland v. Davis, 4 Howard, 148, and cases there cited; Story on Agents, 412, note; Duncan v. Findlater, 6 Clark &amp; Fin. 903, 910.)</p>\n<p>Nor does it alter the case, if another officer, like a Secretary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*106</span> of the Navy, approves of the wrong. Should a post-captain go out of the path of his duty, or act beyond his legitimate authority, it appears on its face an affair between him and the sufferer, and not between the latter and the government.</p>\n<p>The defendant, if he has really been wronged by Commodore Claxton, acting against and beyond his official authority, has not only the usual modes of redress against him in the judicial tribunals, (Jones v. Bird, 5 Barn. &amp; Ald. 837; 15 East, 384,) but it is gratifying to reflect, that resort to Congress is also open for relief, and with success, undoubtedly, should the defendant be able to satisfy Congress he was wronged by the Commodore, and that it is just and proper for the government to atone for any injury so done to him by another.</p>\n<p>But some legislative sanction to this claim, or some recognition by Congress of a right to it, would seem an indispensable preliminary to its allowance in any form in the judicial tribunals against the government. See United States v. McDaniel, 7 Pet. 2 and 16.</p>\n<p>Judge Story in his work on Agents (\u00a7 319) says: \u0097 \"In the next place, as to the liability of public agents for torts or wrongs done in the course of their agency, it is plain that the government itself is not responsible for the misfeasance, or wrongs, or neglects or omissions of duty, of the subordinate officers or agents employed in the public service.\"</p>\n<p>This view is sustained by several adjudged cases, among which are the United States v. Kirkpatrick, 9 Wheat. 720, and 8 Wendell, 403; United States v. Vanzandt, 11 Wheat. 190; 1 Peters, 318; 5 Mason, C.C. 441; 15 East, 393; 6 Clark &amp; Fin. 903.</p>\n<p>Consequently, the judge in the District Court erred in law by permitting a set-off, composed of such a claim, to go to the jury at all. There being error in the instructions on all the three claims, and the judgment in the Circuit Court having affirmed that in the District Court, it must be reversed and one entered disaffirming it, and the case remanded thence to the District Court, in order that there may be a venire de novo in that court, and another trial had in conformity to these views.</p>\n<p>Mr. Justice McLEAN and Mr. Justice GRIER dissented from the above opinion.</p>\n<p>Mr. Justice WAYNE did not sit in the cause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Order.</h2>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*107</span> Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said Circuit Court affirming the judgment of the District Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, reversed, and that this cause be, and the same is hereby, remanded to the said Circuit Court, with directions to enter a disaffirmance of the judgment of the District Court, and to remand this cause to the said District Court, with directions to that court to award a venire facias de novo, and for further proceedings to be had therein in conformity to the opinion of this court.</p>\n</div>",

Should a post-captain go out of the path of his duty, or act beyond his legitimate authority, it appears on its face an affair between him and the sufferer, and not between the latter and the government.</p>\n<p>The defendant, if he has really been wronged by Commodore Claxton, acting against and beyond his official authority, has not only the usual modes of redress against him in the judicial tribunals, (Jones v. Bird, 5 Barn. &amp; Ald. 837; 15 East, 384,) but it is gratifying to reflect, that resort to Congress is also open for relief, and with success, undoubtedly, should the defendant be able to satisfy Congress he was wronged by the Commodore, and that it is just and proper for the government to atone for any injury so done to him by another.</p>\n<p>But some legislative sanction to this claim, or some recognition by Congress of a right to it, would seem an indispensable preliminary to its allowance in any form in the judicial tribunals against the government.

In obedience to this act, the Board of Navy Commissioners prepared a set of 'Rules, Regulations, and Instructions for the Naval Service of the United States,' which were published in Washington in 1818. This is the book which is referred to, both in the subsequent arguments of counsel and opinion of the court, as the Blue Book.

Both descriptions are purchased with the money of the government, but they are differently situated with respect to the commission which the purser receives upon their issue and consumption by the ship's crew. There was no dispute in this case about the first-mentioned class. The purser claimed a commission of ten per cent., which was allowed to him in the settlement of his accounts. The controversy was confined to the second class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May, 1839, the frigate Constitution sailed for the Pacific. She was commanded by Captain Turner, and the defendant the the purser. On board of her was Commodore Claxton, the commander of the squadron on the Pacific station. Early in the year 1840, Commodore Claxton issued an order, that, upon clothing taken from the private stores of the purser, there should not be charged a greater advance than ten per cent. The defendant remonstrated, and a long correspondence ensued; but he was compelled to submit, and during the rest of the voyage he disposed of his stores at that advance, instead of the larger premium to which he considered himself entitled. It is unnecessary to state the particulars of the claim, or the reasons on which it was founded, because the court did not consider it a proper set-off in this action, even if the allegations of the defendant had been well founded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suit was brought by the United States, in the District Court, in May, 1844.

A number of witnesses have been examined, who proved it to have been the custom and usage to charge upon these articles an advance of twenty-five per cent., and that they were considered of secondary necessity. It is true there can be no usage recognized by the courts which is contrary to law. Usage cannot alter the law, but it is evidence of the construction given to it; and when the usage is established, it regulates the rights and duties of those who are within its limits.

The act of 3d March, 1797, directs, not only that legal, but that equitable, credits should be allowed to the debtors of the United States by the proper officers of the Treasury Department, and if then disallowed, that they may be given in evidence at the trial; and this whether the credits arise out of the particular transaction for which he was sued, or any distinct or independent transaction, which would constitute a legal or equitable offset or defense, in whole, or in part, of the debt sued for by the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'If, therefore, you believe the defendant has sustained injury by the order of Commodore Claxton, which, according to these principles, was contrary to law in limiting the prices, and which order was subsequently approved by the Secretary of the Navy, having a full knowledge of the facts, you will, from the evidence, ascertain the amount of such loss, and credit the defendant with it as an equitable defence against the claim of the government. In ascertaining this amount, you will recollect that the prohibition of Commodore Claxton as to price applied only to clothing, or materials of which clothing is made, and to no other articles of secondary necessity.'

But the custom and usage which has been invoked by the defendant in his favor, must also operate when it is established against him. The usage, to be binding, must be uniform, and be applicable to all officers of the same grade, under similar circumstances. It is not sufficient that one, two, or half a dozen officers have been allowed an extra compensation for such services, unless the rule was a general one, so that each officer performing the service might be supposed to rely on the known practice of the government to allow extra compensation at the time the service is performed.

That the ratification of the said Commodore's conduct in the premises by the Secretary of the Navy, with a full knowledge of the facts, rendered the United States liable for any loss sustained by the defendant resulting from a breach of contract as aforesaid, and from the orders of said Commodore, so ratified; and that the Secretary had no right to diminish the established rates of profit with respect to stores purchased by defendant prior to such diminution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">10. That, under the evidence in the cause, it was right to submit to the jury, as a question of fact, what were 'articles of secondary necessity;' and also to charge them, that, if they were satisfied from the evidence of the existence of a usage to consider clothing, and the materials whereof clothing is made, as such articles, and to charge an advance thereon of twenty-five per cent., such usage was evidence of the construction given to the law, and regulated the rights and duties of those acting within its limits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11. That there was no error in charging that the defendant was entitled to a credit for the actual loss proved by him to have been sustained in consequence of being compelled to sell his stores at the advance of ten per cent. only, if he were authorized to charge an advance of twenty-five per cent. on the same. Nor in charging that he was entitled to such credit for all actual loss in consequence of the said order of Commodore Claxton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">12.

The counsel contended that the issue of the Red Book, by competent authority, superseded the Blue Book in the matter of the emoluments of pursers. <i>United States</i> v. <i>McDaniel</i>, 7 Pet., 14; Act of Congress of March 2, 1833, for the relief of E.

As specially applicable to the fifth point, the counsel for defendant cited <i>Henderson</i> v. <i>Moore</i>, 5 Cranch, 11; <i>Barr</i> v. <i>Gratz</i>, 4 Wheat., 213; <i>Blunt's Lessee</i> v. <i>Smith</i>, 7 Wheat., 248; <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Clarke</i>, 4 How., 4; <i>Zeller</i> v. <i>Eckert</i>, Id., 298.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury have found the fact, that the defendant performed these duties upon request, over and above the regular duties of his appointment, that it has been the practice of the government to allow to pursers extra compensation, and that the defendant performed these particular services, with an understanding on both sides that he should be compensated for them as extra services. Surely there can be no legal objection, under these circumstances, to the defendant's claim, upon this head.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the eighth and ninth points, it is remarked, that the Navy Commissioners' Rules, P. 21, section 10, provide,&#8212;'If any officer shall receive an order from his superior, contrary to the general instructions of the Secretary of the Navy, or to any particular order he may have received from the said Secretary of the Navy, or any other superior, he shall represent in writing such contrariety to the superior from whom he shall have received said order; and if, after such representation, the superior shall still insist upon the execution of his order, the officer is to obey him, and to report the circumstances to the commander of the ship, to the commander of the fleet or squadron, or to the Secretary of the Navy, as may be proper.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This mode was strictly pursued by the defendant; and he, of course, lost none of his rights by obeying the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the eleventh and twelfth points on defendant's brief, it is submitted, that the defendant received, by the verdict and judgment below, no allowance or equitable credit, except as a compensation for actual loss theretofore sustained by him, in consequence of the erroneous construction of the rules regulating his compensation on the part of the officers of the government. He being entitled, by contract and law, to dispose of the stores, which had been purchased by him prior to any change of existing regulations, at a fixed rate; and having been compelled by his superior officer, (whose orders were subsequently ratified by the government,) to part with them at a less rate,&#8212;or, in other words, the credit arising from sales made by him, to which he was entitled as an offset against the money placed in his hands by the government, being illegally diminished by the auditing officers of the United States,&#8212;he is at liberty in a suit against him, brought to recover the balance of money in his hands, to assert his rights to the proper rate of profit, and to defalk that from the debit side of his account. The government having deposited in the purser's hands a sum of money, with authority and instructions to buy certain goods therewith, and to dispose of them at fixed rates, cannot, after his purchase and subsequent disposition of these goods, call upon him to refund the money, without an allowance to him of the rates of profit originally agreed upon between them. If, for example, he bought an article, with the government money, for fifty cents, which he was entitled to dispose of for seventy-five cents, and the United States subsequently compel him to sell it for sixty-two and a half cents, they cannot, in calling him to account for the money intrusted to him, deny his right to charge them with the difference of twelve and a half cents, which would make up his legal profit on the transaction. They become, in equity, bound themselves to reimburse him for the actual loss of profit accruing from their act. And such was the judge's charge. He instructed the jury to allow 'only the actual loss sustained by the defendant, and not any prospective or anticipated profits.' <i>United States</i> v. <i>Hawkins</i>, 10 Pet., 125, shows the manner in which the purser's accounts are adjusted at the treasury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the thirteenth point, the following authorities are adduced (a part of these authorities are also applicable to the fifth point):&#8212;<i>United States</i> v. <i>Ripley</i>, 7 Pet., 18; <i>United States</i> v. <i>McDaniel</i>, Id., 1; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Fillebrown</i>, Id., 28; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Wilkins</i>, 6 Wheat., 135.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same general principle as to the right of set-off is laid down in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Robeson</i>, 9 Pet., 319; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Bank of the Metropolis</i>, 15 Id., 377.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice WOODBURY delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a writ of error, presenting three distinct grounds of exception to the judgment rendered in the court below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither of these is claimed to justify us in revising the finding of the jury on the evidence, though the verdict was not acceptable in some respects to the district judge who tried the cause, but should have been scrutinized by him, if at all, and, if clearly wrong, submitted to another jury for correction on the motion for a new trial. The exceptions to be now considered, are, therefore, confined to the instructions given to the jury concerning the claims made in set-off by the original defendant, and are, that they all were, in point of law, incorrect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those claims were,&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1st.

But it appears that such commissions were not, at any period, usually allowed to permanent pursers. And though one or two instances were given of such allowances under peculiar circumstances, they were limited to that number; and on the 10th of November, 1826, commissions to commanders of squadrons, and 'officers of any grade,' for drawing such bills, were expressly abolished. (Red Book in the Navy, p. 10 and p. 27. See also Letter of 4th Auditor, 26th June, 1844; Circular, 1st April, 1833.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the present claim was presented to the department by Mr. Buchanan, in 1831, it was, therefore, rejected, and seems to have been abandoned by him for nearly ten years after, when, another difficulty arising as to other transactions of his in the Pacific, this claim was revived, and offered in set-off to a suit by the government for moneys then recently advanced to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On what ground, then, could the district judge properly leave its allowance to the jury, as he did at the trial in this case? It seems to us, that he should have instructed them that, in point of law, neither any act of Congress, nor any regulation of the department, justified the allowance; that the service performed was an ordinary one, connected with a purser's official duties, and consequently, for which, in point of law, he was entitled to no extra compensation by way of commissions or otherwise. (See <i>Gratiot</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 4 How., 112.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two cases, often relied on to justify such an allowance, were both claims for what was deemed by the court extra service. (<i>United States</i> v. <i>McDaniel</i>, and <i>United States</i> v. <i>Fillebrown</i>, 7 Pet., 16 and 28.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the subject of a usage or custom, attempted to be proved, to overturn these principles and decisions, it seems to us that the judge should have ruled, that a usage ought not to be permitted to be set up, where a rule, as here, is not doubtful, but settled. (<i>Brown</i> v. <i>Jackson</i>, 2 Wash. C. C., 24; 6 Binn. (Pa.), 417.) And that a usage or custom, when admissible, must, in order to be valid, be ancient, reasonable, and generally known (3 Wash. C. C., 149), and also be certain (<i>United States</i> v. <i>Duval</i>, Gilp., 372). Consequently, when it appeared here that the compensation was fixed or clear, and when it appeared that only one, or at the furthest, two extra allowances could be proved of commissions for such services by permanent pursers, and those under peculiar circumstances, he should have directed that, in point of law, these last did not constitute a valid usage or custom, and that there was nothing properly to be left to the jury on the subject. In the <i>United States</i> v. <i>McDaniel</i>, 7 Pet., 16, the usage had existed uninterruptedly for fifteen years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a very good description of a custom or usage in ch. 1, art. 3, of the Civil Code of Louisiana:&#8212;'Customs result from a long series of actions, constantly repeated, which have, by such repetition and by uninterrupted acquiescence, acquired the force of a tacit and common consent.' How imperfectly the evidence in the present case meets the requirements of such a definition as this, or of any legal view of a valid usage, is so obvious as not to need further explanation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second claim, for paying mechanics and laborers at the navy-yard at Pensacola, from 1835 to 1837, stands in a similar condition. It was a service expressly imposed on a purser of a yard as official, by the Blue Book of the navy, as early as 1818 (p. 14).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the judge instructed the jury, that this book had ceased to be in force. In this he erred. For the navy department, in 1831, had expressly and officially published, that it was still 'in full force,' except in two or three other particulars, specified in a note to the Red Book (p. 49, note). The latter, also, was then first printed, and not only did not profess to repeal the former, but such was not its legal effect. The Blue Book related chiefly to other matters than what were in the Red Book, and which were as necessarily to remain regulated by the former after the publication of the latter as before, and even now as then.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Blue Book concerns the complement of officers and men for vessels of different sizes, the duties of those officers on shipboard and at yards, salutes, recruiting, &amp;c.; and not, like the Red Book, relating to decisions in the civil administration of the department, and circulars, orders, &amp;c., connected with it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The latter was a mere collection of these latter matters, before existing dispersed and in manuscript; and being compiled and printed for the benefit of navy officers, as well as the department, the date of each decision and circular was given, so that officers might see, if decisions, regulations, or circulars conflicted in any degree, as they sometimes might, which was of most recent date, and consequently often modifying or superseding one made earlier. The Red Book introduced nothing new into the service, nor professed to do it, but merely arranged and made more generally known by printing, in 1831, what had before taken place on the matters described in it, as had been done in relation to some matters in the Blue Book, by printing and distributing that in 1818, as well as compiling and publishing in that other things new and permanently useful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There being, then, no repeal of this part of the Blue Book relating to the duties of pursers at yards, the payment of mechanics and laborers stood, as ever since 1818, if not longer, an official duty of pursers stationed at them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The idea of attempting to set up a usage to pay commissions for this service, and leave merely one case of the kind to the jury as evidence of such a usage, was altogether untenable on sound principles, as before shown under the firrst claim. All the other cases referred to in support of such a usage or custom were not cases to allow commissions, though sometimes to sanction a sum of money for a clerk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But even this last had been abolished as early as 1826, long before the service performed by the original defendant, and only an additional steward had been since allowed at yards where the workmen were numerous. (Red Book, 52. See Letter of 4th Auditor, June 26, 1844, and Circular of 1st April, 1833.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p169\">\n      <span class=\"num\">169</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, likewise, another defect in the instructions to the jury on both of these points, in permitting the testimony of naval officers, and sometimes of subordinate ones, rather than the head of the department, to go to the jury to enable them to decide what were and were not official duties, when it was rather the province of the court, after being duly informed from proper sources, to settle that as a question of law, and direct the jury upon it. (4 How., 80; 6 Binn. (Pa.), 417.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p170\">\n      <span class=\"num\">170</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third ground of claim, and the instructions upon it, are in some respects different, and remain to be considered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p171\">\n      <span class=\"num\">171</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This claim was for commissions lost on the sale of slops and for depreciation in property, caused by orders of Commodore Claxton in the Pacific in 1839.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p172\">\n      <span class=\"num\">172</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The latter, finding that an unusual quantity of some kinds of clothing had been issued by the defendant from his private stores, on which an advance of twenty-five per cent. had been charged, and only a small quantity from the public stores, on which only ten per cent. advance was charged, interposed and issued an ordr against taxing the crew over ten per cent. advance on certain articles of wearing apparel, on which the defendant insisted he was entitled to twenty-five. This claim is for a loss of the difference between ten and twenty-five per cent. on what was and might have been sold, and loss by depreciation on articles not sold. Considering the views entertained by this court on the impropriety in law of allowing this claim to be put in at in set-off to this action, it is not necessary to decide have which percentage was the proper one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p173\">\n      <span class=\"num\">173</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the one hand, the opinion of the Commodore was sustained by that of Mr. Paulding, then Secretary of the Navy,&#8212;presumed to be best acquainted with the previous constructions in the navy department,&#8212;and by the express language of the Blue Book (pp. 103 and 105), and by some early decisions published in the Red Book (p. 18), as well as by the views of some of the members of this Court; yet other constructions of these decisions tend to sustain the claim, as do the views of other members of this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p174\">\n      <span class=\"num\">174</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whichever of these constructions, then, may be correct, is not now settled, because we think it clear, that such a claim as this is not allowable at all by way of set-off to an action brought by the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p175\">\n      <span class=\"num\">175</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute of March 3d, 1797, which allows set-offs, has had a very liberal construction by this court, extending it to matters even distinct from the cause of action, if only such as the defendant is entitled to a credit on, whether equitable or legal. (<i>United States</i> v. <i>Wilkins</i>, 6 Wheat., 135; <i>Ripley</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 7 Pet., 25.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p176\">\n      <span class=\"num\">176</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The object is to settle between the parties their mutual accounts or debts. (See the Act of Congress.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p177\">\n      <span class=\"num\">177</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But any wrongs or torts done, and any unliquidated damages claimed, have never been permitted as a set-off. (<i>Butts</i> v. <i>Collins</i>, 13 Wend. (N. Y.), 156; <i>McDonald</i> v. <i>Neilson</i>, 2 Cow. (N. Y.), 140; <i>Heck</i> v. <i>Sheener</i>, 4 Serg. &amp; R. (Pa.), 249; 10 Id., 14.) This rule prevails when the United States are plaintiffs, as well as individuals. (<i>United States</i> v. <i>Robeson</i>, 9 Pet., 325.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p178\">\n      <span class=\"num\">178</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much less could wrongs done by others than the United States, and for whom it would be a very grave question whether the United States were in law responsible, be set off, and unliquidated damages allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p179\">\n      <span class=\"num\">179</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a transaction, whether sounding <i>ex delicto</i> or <i>ex contractu</i>, seems to be one between the two officers, rather than between one of them and the government. (<i>United States</i> v. <i>Hawkins</i>, 10 Pet., 134; 9 Id., 319.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p180\">\n      <span class=\"num\">180</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is certain, that no action could technically be sustained against the United States for any wrong done here by Commodore Claxton. And, waiving their sovereignty to bar a suit, it is quite manifest that no claim exists as a matter of course against the government for a wrong done by one officer against another officer, or by oen officer against an individual, when the liability of the officer himself for public acts is often questionable; and when the liability of the government for his acts, private or public, is still more in doubt. (<i>Garland</i> v. <i>Davis</i>, 4 How., 148, and cases there cited; Story on Agency, 412, <i>n.; Duncan</i> v. <i>Findlater</i>, 6 Cl. &amp; F., 903, 910.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p181\">\n      <span class=\"num\">181</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does it alter the case, if another officer, liek a secretary of the navy, approves of the wrong. Should a post-captain go out of the path of his duty, or act beyond his legitimate authority, it appears on its face an affair between him and the sufferer, and not between the latter and the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p182\">\n      <span class=\"num\">182</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant, if he has really been wronged by Commodore Claxton, acting against and beyond his official authority, has not only the usual modes of redress against him in the judicial tribunals, (<i>Jones</i> v. <i>Bird</i>, 5 Barn. &amp; Ald., 837; 15 East, 384,) but it is gratifying to reflect, that resort to Congress is also open for relief, and with success, undoubtedly, should the defendant be able to satisfy Congress he was wronged by the Commodore, and that it is just and proper for the government to atone for any injury so done to him by another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p183\">\n      <span class=\"num\">183</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But some legislative sanction to this claim, or some recognition by Congress of a right to it, would seem an indispensable preliminary to its allowance in any form in the judicial tribunals against the government. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>McDaniel</i>, 7 Pet., 2 and 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p184\">\n      <span class=\"num\">184</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Story in his work on Agents (&#167; 319) says:&#8212;'In the next place, as to the liability of public agents for torts or wrongs done in the course of their agency, it is plain that the government itself is not responsible for the misfeasance, or wrongs, or neglects or omissions of duty, of the subordinate officers or agents employed in the public service.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p185\">\n      <span class=\"num\">185</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This view is sustained by several adjudged cases, among which are the <i>United States</i> v. <i>Kirkpatrick</i>, 9 Wheat., 720, and 8 Wend. (N. Y.), 403; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Vanzandt</i>, 11 Wheat., 190; 1 Pet., 318; 5 Mason, 441; 15 East, 393; 6 Cl. &amp; F., 903.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p186\">\n      <span class=\"num\">186</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently the judge in the District Court erred in law by permitting a set-off, composed of such a claim, to go to the jury at all. There being error in the instructions on all the three claims, and the judgment in the Circuit Court having affirmed that in the District Court, it must be reversed and one entered disaffirming it, and the case remanded thence to the District Court, in order that there may be a <i>venire de novo</i> in that court, and another trial had in conformity to these views.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice McLEAN and Mr. Justice GRIER dissented from the above opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p188\">\n      <span class=\"num\">188</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice WAYNE did not sit in the cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\"><i>Order</i>.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p189\">\n      <span class=\"num\">189</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pensylvania, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said Circuit Court affirming the judgment of the District Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, reversed, and that this cause be, and the same is hereby, remanded to the said Circuit Court, with directions to enter a disaffirmance of the judgment of the District Court, and to remand this cause to the said District Court, with directions to that court to award a <i>venire facias de novo</i>, and for further proceedings to be had therein in conformity to the opinion of this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
