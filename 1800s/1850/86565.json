The jury found him guilty. The defendant then moved in arrest of judgment, and to set aside the verdict, for the following reasons:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First. Because the facts set forth in the indictment in this cause do not constitute a criminal offence, punishable by indictment, under the statutes of the United States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second. Because, under the statutes of the United States, trespass on the public lands, by cutting timber thereon, is in no case an offence punishable criminally by indictment, but is a mere civil trespass, and as such punichable only by action of trespass at common law, or debt on the statute.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third. Because the said indictment does not aver, nor was there any evidence to show, that the lands on which said timber was cut was reserved or set apart for naval purposes, according to the provisions of the statutes of the United States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth. Because there was no proof on the trial of the said cause that the timber cut consisted of live-oak or red-cedar trees, nor is there any averment in said indictment that any such trees were cut on the lands described in said indictment.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth.

We do not understand this to be controvered. But the question here is, whether the term 'or other timber' imposes the same penalty on those who cut other timbers, such as oak or hickory trees. It is insisted by the reasons in arrest, that the only object of the act was to protect, by stringent penalties, timbers suited to ship-building and naval purposes, and which had been reserved for such public use; and that it is apparent from the act none other, were contemplated by Congress, as subject to protection and within the description, but live-oak and red-cedar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To which it is answered, on the part of the United States:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'1.
