Amis, issued execution thereon and caused to be seized seven slaves. The complainant, Junius Amis, thereupon filed his bill, claiming these slaves as his property, and praying an injunction to arrest the sale of them. He made David Myers and W. F. Wagner, the marshal, parties defendant to the bill. The injunction was afterwards granted.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David Myers appeared and filed his answer. He admitted the issuance of the execution as alleged, and he admitted the marshal's seizure of the property as alleged, and the advertisement for sale under the process; but he denied the complainant's title, and denied all interest in him, legal or equitable, concerning the said slaves. And the defendant further charged that these slaves were purchased by William D. Amis, of Nathaniel Hill, in New Orleans, for the sum of five thousand dollars; that they were delivered to him and taken by him to the plantation on which he resided, in the parish of Madison, where they remained until the levy aforesaid.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Circuit Court, upon the final hearing upon bill, answer, depositions, and proofs, dissolved the injunction, and dismissed the bill with costs.
