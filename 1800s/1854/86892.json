On the 18th February, 1841, judicial possession was given to claimant by Juan Miguel Anzar, Judge of First Instance of that jurisdiction.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Said land has been occupied by claimant, according to law and the directions contained in said grant, and is now held by him in quiet possession.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no conflicting grant to said land, or any part thereof, in the knowledge of claimant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Said land has never been surveyed, but its boundaries are natural and well known, and may be easily traced. It is supposed to contain the quantity of two sitios de ganado mayor, more or less.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A copy and translation of said grant, and a copy of said act of judicial possession, are herewith presented, and the originals are ready to be produced and proved, as may be required.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the 3d of August, 1852, Commissioner <i>Harvy J. Thornton</i> delivered the opinion of the board, declaring the claim valid.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July, 1853, the following notice was issued:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CRUZ CERVANTES, claimant, <i>vs.</i> UNITED STATES.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S OFFICE,</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Washington, D.
