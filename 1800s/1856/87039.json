Pending the suits his clients offered to sell their interest to him for $5,000, or to other persons for $10,000.

The articles of the code of Louisiana affecting this question are as follows: art. 2623, 'a right is said to be litigious whenever there exists a suit and contestation about the same'; art. 3522, No. 22, 'litigious rights are those which cannot be exercised without undergoing a lawsuit'; art. 2624, 'public officers connected with courts of justice, such as judges, advocates, attorneys, clerks, and sheriffs, cannot purchase litigious rights which fall under the jurisdiction of the tribunal in which they exercise their functions, under penalty of nullity and of having to defray all costs, damages, and interest.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The courts of Louisiana have decided 'that where a judgment has been rendered litigation has ceased.'

Provost <i>v.</i> Johnson, 9 Mart. 184. The bill charges that the purchase was made after a final judgment had been rendered, declaring the property to belong to the heirs of Fletcher. The subject of the sale was ascertained, the title recognized, and consequently none of the mischiefs which occasioned these articles could then follow.

The latter cannot be heard to object that there was illegality in the contract between Fletcher's heirs and the appellee, nor to appropriate to himself the fruit of that contract.
