After various proceedings, the Circuit Court (State court) decreed against Wynn. The Supreme Court of the State reversed this decree, and ordered Garland to convey the land in question to Wynn, upon payment of two hundred dollars, with interest; or in case of neglect, that the decree should stand as a conveyance, &amp;c.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this decree, Garland appealed to this court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal points of law involved in the argument were: 1st, whether or not Wynn could interpose between the United States and the patentee; and, 2d, whether the decision of the officers of the land office was not conclusive upon all person except the United States, and upon them also until the patent was vacated by regular judicial authority.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice CATRON delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November, 1842, William Wynn (the complainant below) proved that he had a preference of entry to the quarter section of land in dispute, according to the act of 1838, and his entry was allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February, 1843, Samuel Hemphill made proof that he had a right of pre-emption to the same land, under the act of May 26th, 1830.
