He could hire a substitute to attend to the latter for a less sum than he could to transact the former.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence offered was clearly admissible for these purposes, and went to show the damage actually sustained. If the plaintiff's business had been that of a day laborer, who could only earn a dollar per day, his actual loss would be far less than if he had been earning ten. If he had been employed on wages, the injury could have been ascertained by proving the compensation he received.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When engaged in his own business, the extent of his loss could only be ascertained by proving the nature and extent of his business, so as to show how much his services were actually worth to himself. If his business were small, and easily managed, the damage would be less than if it were large, and managed with difficulty. The manager of a large plantation would sustain more damage by loss of his time than the manager of a smill patch of land. A lawyer earning ten thousand dollars per annum would sustain a greater loss in being rendered unfit for business, than would a pettifogger who could only earn a hundred or two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SECOND.&#8212;<i>Future as well as present losses may be considered in estimating damages</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a party loses a leg or arm, in estimating his real loss, we look to his probable future under the state of his injury, to form an opinion of the demages he has sustained. If the injury is temporary, the damages will be far less than if lasting and permanent. A flesh wound will soon heal, but a lost limb cannot be restored; both should, however, be considered in estimating the damages sustained&#8212;the loss of a limb will be continually felt as long as the party losing shall live, and hence a young person will sustain a greater injury than one whose life is nearly ended. If the <i>mind</i> is destroyed, the loss to a young man, who is supposed to have more years before him than an old one, is much greater than with one whose years are drawing to a close. It follows, that the probable future of the injured party is a proper subject of consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THIRD.&#8212;<i>The damage alleged in the declaration was special, as distinguished from particular damage</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Particular damage is where the particular instance of damage is avowed; special damage is where the loss follows from a specific statement of a fact, which generally or naturally results from the statement, as a cause competent to entail such a consequence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The declaration avers that the injury affected the plaintiff's brain, and affected his memory and understanding, which were impaired thereby; and that he lost his sense of hearing; and that he would hereafter suffer much mental and bodily pain and anguish, as well as personal mortification. The damages so specified were special, but not particular&#8212;the averment is, that they resulted from the injury. If the injury complained of affected and injured his brain, and impaired his understanding, and he lost his sense of hearing, a necessary and natural consequence was, that he was incompetent to attend to any business, and especially such as that in which he was engaged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A man who could not hear, and whose brain was injured and affected, and his memory and understanding injured and impaired, was not competent to pursue the business in which the plaintiff was engaged, even though he might have been able to attend to some kinds of business, like tending a porter's lodge, where very little memory or understanding is required. If the plaintiff were not permitted to prove these consequences, necessarily resulting from facts specifically avowed, then he would be debarred presenting a very essential part of his case, and would be prevented from recovering the whole amount of damages actually sustained. This would occasion gross injustice. When a person is made deaf, his memory and understanding injured and impaired, it is hardly possible that any pecuniary damage can make him good: he cannot be fit for business; he can do nothing and earn nothing in his business, if it should require the exercise of hearing, or memory, or understanding. Aside from the pecuniary consequences resulting from such an injury, his life must be one both monotonous and irksome, and almost wholly destitute of those pleasures and that happiness which those in full health, bodily and mentally, must ever enjoy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FOURTH.&#8212;<i>When the action can be maintained without specifying any particular damage, it is not necessary to aver any particular instance of damage</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the law implies damage, there can be no reason for stating it with particularity. If a person loses an eye, an ear, a limb, or his general health, the law implies damage, the same as if deprived of his property or any other legal right. Words actionable in themselves imply damage, and none need be proved; but if actionable only by reason of some consequence which might or might not follow, then the <i>particular</i> damage must be averred and proved. The loss of hearing, of memory, and understanding, imply injury, and necessarily and naturally result therefrom, and no particular damage need be averred or proved. This change in the condition of a person cannot be made without producing injury to him in his pecuniary circumstances and in his enjoyments. Such an injury would lessen, if not destroy, his ability to maintain and support his family by his own exertions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It required no averment in the declaration to apprise the defendant that such consequences must result from the injuries specified. They are so necessary and natural that no one could mistake them. Every common understanding must arrive at the same conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FIFTH.&#8212;<i>The evidence offered tended to prove necessary and natural injurious consequences arising from the injury to the plaintiff, within the settled rules of law</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The courts have furnished precedents that clearly sustain the offer of the plaintiff below, and so do the elementary writers. Mayne on Damages, the latest and best English writer, says:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Special damage must always be expressly averred and proved, when it is so much the gist of the action, that without it no suit could be maintained.'&#8212;P. 314.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'It is not, however, necessary to state or establish particular instances of damage.'&#8212;P. 315.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'In all other cases, whether the action be on contract, or in tort, if the facts involve a legal injury, no actual damage need be stated.'&#8212;P. 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'In contracts, too, there are certain damages which the law will presume; as, for instance, in an action for not delivering goods; that the plaintiff had to buy others at a loss. * * * The extent of the loss must be proved; but no notice need be given of the species of loss which will be set up. But it is different where the injury complained of is merely secondary and consequential damage.'&#8212;P. 316.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'In an action for slandering a man in his trade, when the declaration alleges that he thereby lost his trade, he may show a general damage to his trade, though he cannot give evidence of particular instances.'&#8212;P. 317.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'So if one, not a carpenter, sell timber which the purchaser uses to prop up his building, and, by reason of the timber being defective, the building fall and be destroyed, if the seller acted in good faith, and was ignorant of the defect, he will only be liable for the difference in price between good timber and that sold.

In slander and libel, when the action lies only by reason that the defamatory matter complained of touched the plaintiff in some particular office, employment, or relation, the averment of that office, &amp;c., is not called by pleaders an averment of special damages. It is a part of the cause of action; but <i>being notified to the defendant</i>, it may be proved, and, of course, may have its just weight with the jury. Here there is no danger of surprise. (Ingram <i>v.</i> Lawson, 6 Bingh. N. C., 212; ib., 8 Scott, 775; 9 Carr and Payne, 326; 1 Selden's N. Y. Rep., 20; Donnell <i>v.</i> Jones, 17 Alabama, 692 to 695; S. C., 13 Alab. R., 509, 510; Delegall <i>v.</i> Highley, 8 Carr and Payne, 444; Rollin <i>v.</i> Stewart, 25 Eng. L. and Eq.

In cases of defamation, where the matter is not actionable generally, nor actionable so as to give a right to general damage, by reason of its touching the plaintiff in his particular office, employment, &amp;c., the plaintiff is obligated to aver in his declaration the special damage on which he relies, and to prove it at the trial. All the adjudications arising under this head in our law, whether on demurrer, or in arrest of judgment, or for variance at the trial, are so many illustrations of the rule contended for in this point. (Malachi <i>v.</i> Soper, 3 Bingh. N. C., 371.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Second Point</i>.&#8212;As the defendants, on being charged with the injury alleged in the declaration, could not learn, from anything in the narrative of its occurrence and consequences, that the plaintiff was connected with a particular business carried on in North Carolina, it would be a great surprise upon them to allow evidence of that fact. Therefore, the evidence mentioned in the first division should be excluded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I. There is nothing on this subject contained in the declaration, which, according to the precedents and authorities, could be otherwise regarded than as a general averment that the plaintiff was disabled by his hurt. (Rogers <i>v.</i> Nowill, 11 Jurist, 1039; Malachi <i>v.</i> Soper, 3 Bingh. N. C., 371; 1 Strange, 666; W. Jones, 196; Buller's N. P., 7; 1 Sid., 396; 1 Saunders's R., 346; Linden <i>v.</i> Graham, 1 Duer, 670.) For proper pleading, see Collet <i>v.</i> Lond. and N. W. Railway Co., 6 Eng. L. and Eq., 305; Brewer <i>v.</i> Drew, 11 M. and Welsby, 626, 630; Hodsoll <i>v.</i> Stallbrass, 9 Car. and Payne, 63.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. There was no difficulty in stating in the declaration the special consequential injury offered to be proven. It was not a violation of decency to place it on the record; it did not tend to burdensome prolixity; it was known to the plaintiff, and quite susceptible of being accurately described by him. There was, consequently, no excuse for its suppression. (2 Williams's Saunders, 411, note 4, 8 T. R., 133; 1 Starkie's R., 172; Lowden <i>v.</i> Goodrich, Peake's N. P. Cases, 46; 2 Greenleaf's Ev., &#167; 278; Per Kenyon, L. Ch. J., 8 T. R., 133.) Anomalous Cases. (Driggs <i>v.</i> Dwight, 17 Wend., 71; Ward <i>v.</i> Smith, 11 Price, 19; See Tullidge <i>v.</i> Wade, 3 Wils., 19.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III. This evidence is the more objectionable, if unaccompanied by any proof of the particular value of this large and extensive business of distilling and manufacturing turpentine, in which the plaintiff was engaged. If such evidence must be admitted, it would be much fairer to admit it with particular and certain proof of the value of the business, than in a vague, loose, and indefinite form. Far better that the defendants should be tried without notice, on evidence appealing to the judgment of the jury, than on an inflated address to their imaginations. (Fairman <i>v.</i> Fluck, 5 Watts, 518.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Third Point</i>.&#8212;Evidence that the injury would <i>permanently</i> disqualify the plaintiff from pursuing any business, was objectionable in a twofold point of view. In the first place, the declaration does not affirmatively allege that the injury would produce any such result, or that the defendant was a person engaged in <i>any</i> business; and secondly, inasmuch as in speaking of bodily pain, &amp;c., the declaration has a <i>future</i> aspect, and the general allegation of consequent incapacity to attend to <i>affairs</i> is confined to the past; the idea of any probable future incapacity is impliedly negatived. The point involved in the second division ought therefore to be certified in favor of the defendants. (Hodsoll <i>v.</i> Stallbrass, 9 C. and Payne, 63; S. C., 3 Perry and Davison, 200; Thompson <i>v.</i> Wood, 4 Ad. and Ellis, N.

That, in consequence of the wound, his brain was affected and injured, so that his understanding and memory were impaired. That for some time he was insensible, and his life despaired of; and before his recovery, he suffered much mental and bodily pain. That he was detained in New York, at a distance from his home, and subjected to much expense about his care, support, and maintenance, and had been hindered and prevented for a long period from transacting and attending to his necessary and lawful affairs, by him during all that time to be performed and transacted; and lost and was deprived of great gains, profits, and advantages, which he might and otherwise would have derived and acquired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plea was the general issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the trial, the plaintiff offered to prove, 'that before and up to and at the time of the alleged injury, the particular business in which he was engaged was that of a distiller and manufacturer of turpentine, and that he was largely and extensively engaged in that business.' The plaintiff also offered 'to prove, by a physician who had attended the plaintiff, that when the plaintiff, after his convalescence, left New York to return to North Carolina, he (plaintiff) could not safely attend to any business or occupation, and that the witness deemed it imprudent and indiscreet for the plaintiff thenceforth to devote himself to any business.' To this evidence the defendants' counsel objected, on the ground that the declaration of the plaintiff did not contain any specification of such business, or of its nature or extent, or contain any statement that the plaintiff was obliged or did relinquish or abandon the same. The judges were divided in opinion as to the admissibility of such evidence, and have certified the questions for the decision of this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The precise object for which this evidence was adduced is not stated in the certificate of the judges; but if the evidence tends to support any issue between the parties, or has a direct connection with other evidence competent to maintain the averments of the declaration, either to illustrate its meaning or to ascertain its probative effect, it cannot be rejected as impertinent, or as founded upon matter that does not appear in the pleadings of the cause. The evidence objected to conduces to prove that the plaintiff was seriously injured; that he had been confined in New York, at a distance from his home, and had incurred expense in consequence. That, before that time, he had been concerned in conducting a business that required a degree of mental and bodily vigor, and that his time was of some pecuniary value; or, that he had suffered a loss of some profit; and that, after some detention in New York, he had returned to his house in an infirm condition&#8212;so infirm that his medical attendant and adviser deemed him incapable of pursuing any ordinary business or occupation, and had advised him to abstain from personal exertion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence would certainly assist a jury to determine that the plaintiff had sustained an injury of no slight character&#8212;an injury to his person, and which was followed by expense, suffering, and loss of time, which had for him a pecuniary value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These were the direct and necessary consequences of the injury, and sustained strictly and almost exclusively as an effect from it. This evidence may have an application without any inquiry into any remote or contingent consequences which could not have been foreseen, or which were peculiar to the circumstances or condition of the plaintiff. The record does not inform us that the evidence was designed to aid in such irrelevant inquiries, and we cannot presume that, if admitted, the court would allow any misconstruction of its legal import, or any use of it by the jury, contrary to law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The opinion of the court is, that the evidence is competent, and we direct that the certificate to the Circuit Court shall be made accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "", "html_with_citations": "<p class=\"case_cite\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></span></p>\n    <p class=\"case_cite\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></span></p>\n    <p class=\"case_cite\">15 L.Ed. 813</p>\n    <p class=\"parties\">AMOS WADE, PLAINTIFF,<br>v.<br>JACOB R.

He could hire a substitute to attend to the latter for a less sum than he could to transact the former.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence offered was clearly admissible for these purposes, and went to show the damage actually sustained. If the plaintiff's business had been that of a day laborer, who could only earn a dollar per day, his actual loss would be far less than if he had been earning ten. If he had been employed on wages, the injury could have been ascertained by proving the compensation he received.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When engaged in his own business, the extent of his loss could only be ascertained by proving the nature and extent of his business, so as to show how much his services were actually worth to himself. If his business were small, and easily managed, the damage would be less than if it were large, and managed with difficulty. The manager of a large plantation would sustain more damage by loss of his time than the manager of a smill patch of land. A lawyer earning ten thousand dollars per annum would sustain a greater loss in being rendered unfit for business, than would a pettifogger who could only earn a hundred or two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SECOND.&#8212;<i>Future as well as present losses may be considered in estimating damages</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a party loses a leg or arm, in estimating his real loss, we look to his probable future under the state of his injury, to form an opinion of the demages he has sustained. If the injury is temporary, the damages will be far less than if lasting and permanent. A flesh wound will soon heal, but a lost limb cannot be restored; both should, however, be considered in estimating the damages sustained&#8212;the loss of a limb will be continually felt as long as the party losing shall live, and hence a young person will sustain a greater injury than one whose life is nearly ended. If the <i>mind</i> is destroyed, the loss to a young man, who is supposed to have more years before him than an old one, is much greater than with one whose years are drawing to a close. It follows, that the probable future of the injured party is a proper subject of consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THIRD.&#8212;<i>The damage alleged in the declaration was special, as distinguished from particular damage</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Particular damage is where the particular instance of damage is avowed; special damage is where the loss follows from a specific statement of a fact, which generally or naturally results from the statement, as a cause competent to entail such a consequence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The declaration avers that the injury affected the plaintiff's brain, and affected his memory and understanding, which were impaired thereby; and that he lost his sense of hearing; and that he would hereafter suffer much mental and bodily pain and anguish, as well as personal mortification. The damages so specified were special, but not particular&#8212;the averment is, that they resulted from the injury. If the injury complained of affected and injured his brain, and impaired his understanding, and he lost his sense of hearing, a necessary and natural consequence was, that he was incompetent to attend to any business, and especially such as that in which he was engaged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A man who could not hear, and whose brain was injured and affected, and his memory and understanding injured and impaired, was not competent to pursue the business in which the plaintiff was engaged, even though he might have been able to attend to some kinds of business, like tending a porter's lodge, where very little memory or understanding is required. If the plaintiff were not permitted to prove these consequences, necessarily resulting from facts specifically avowed, then he would be debarred presenting a very essential part of his case, and would be prevented from recovering the whole amount of damages actually sustained. This would occasion gross injustice. When a person is made deaf, his memory and understanding injured and impaired, it is hardly possible that any pecuniary damage can make him good: he cannot be fit for business; he can do nothing and earn nothing in his business, if it should require the exercise of hearing, or memory, or understanding. Aside from the pecuniary consequences resulting from such an injury, his life must be one both monotonous and irksome, and almost wholly destitute of those pleasures and that happiness which those in full health, bodily and mentally, must ever enjoy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FOURTH.&#8212;<i>When the action can be maintained without specifying any particular damage, it is not necessary to aver any particular instance of damage</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the law implies damage, there can be no reason for stating it with particularity. If a person loses an eye, an ear, a limb, or his general health, the law implies damage, the same as if deprived of his property or any other legal right. Words actionable in themselves imply damage, and none need be proved; but if actionable only by reason of some consequence which might or might not follow, then the <i>particular</i> damage must be averred and proved. The loss of hearing, of memory, and understanding, imply injury, and necessarily and naturally result therefrom, and no particular damage need be averred or proved. This change in the condition of a person cannot be made without producing injury to him in his pecuniary circumstances and in his enjoyments. Such an injury would lessen, if not destroy, his ability to maintain and support his family by his own exertions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It required no averment in the declaration to apprise the defendant that such consequences must result from the injuries specified. They are so necessary and natural that no one could mistake them. Every common understanding must arrive at the same conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FIFTH.&#8212;<i>The evidence offered tended to prove necessary and natural injurious consequences arising from the injury to the plaintiff, within the settled rules of law</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The courts have furnished precedents that clearly sustain the offer of the plaintiff below, and so do the elementary writers.

In slander and libel, when the action lies only by reason that the defamatory matter complained of touched the plaintiff in some particular office, employment, or relation, the averment of that office, &amp;c., is not called by pleaders an averment of special damages. It is a part of the cause of action; but <i>being notified to the defendant</i>, it may be proved, and, of course, may have its just weight with the jury. Here there is no danger of surprise. (Ingram <i>v.</i> Lawson, 6 Bingh. N. C., 212; ib., 8 Scott, 775; 9 Carr and Payne, 326; 1 Selden's N. Y. Rep., 20; Donnell <i>v.</i> Jones, 17 Alabama, 692 to 695; S. C., 13 Alab.

In cases of defamation, where the matter is not actionable generally, nor actionable so as to give a right to general damage, by reason of its touching the plaintiff in his particular office, employment, &amp;c., the plaintiff is obligated to aver in his declaration the special damage on which he relies, and to prove it at the trial. All the adjudications arising under this head in our law, whether on demurrer, or in arrest of judgment, or for variance at the trial, are so many illustrations of the rule contended for in this point. (Malachi <i>v.</i> Soper, 3 Bingh. N. C., 371.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Second Point</i>.&#8212;As the defendants, on being charged with the injury alleged in the declaration, could not learn, from anything in the narrative of its occurrence and consequences, that the plaintiff was connected with a particular business carried on in North Carolina, it would be a great surprise upon them to allow evidence of that fact. Therefore, the evidence mentioned in the first division should be excluded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I. There is nothing on this subject contained in the declaration, which, according to the precedents and authorities, could be otherwise regarded than as a general averment that the plaintiff was disabled by his hurt. (Rogers <i>v.</i> Nowill, 11 Jurist, 1039; Malachi <i>v.</i> Soper, 3 Bingh. N. C., 371; 1 Strange, 666; W. Jones, 196; Buller's N. P., 7; 1 Sid., 396; 1 Saunders's R., 346; Linden <i>v.</i> Graham, 1 Duer, 670.) For proper pleading, see Collet <i>v.</i> Lond. and N. W. Railway Co., 6 Eng.

There was no difficulty in stating in the declaration the special consequential injury offered to be proven. It was not a violation of decency to place it on the record; it did not tend to burdensome prolixity; it was known to the plaintiff, and quite susceptible of being accurately described by him. There was, consequently, no excuse for its suppression. (2 Williams's Saunders, 411, note 4, 8 T. R., 133; 1 Starkie's R., 172; Lowden <i>v.</i> Goodrich, Peake's N. P. Cases, 46; 2 Greenleaf's Ev., &#167; 278; Per Kenyon, L. Ch. J., 8 T. R., 133.) Anomalous Cases.

This evidence is the more objectionable, if unaccompanied by any proof of the particular value of this large and extensive business of distilling and manufacturing turpentine, in which the plaintiff was engaged. If such evidence must be admitted, it would be much fairer to admit it with particular and certain proof of the value of the business, than in a vague, loose, and indefinite form. Far better that the defendants should be tried without notice, on evidence appealing to the judgment of the jury, than on an inflated address to their imaginations. (Fairman <i>v.</i> Fluck, 5 Watts, 518.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Third Point</i>.&#8212;Evidence that the injury would <i>permanently</i> disqualify the plaintiff from pursuing any business, was objectionable in a twofold point of view. In the first place, the declaration does not affirmatively allege that the injury would produce any such result, or that the defendant was a person engaged in <i>any</i> business; and secondly, inasmuch as in speaking of bodily pain, &amp;c., the declaration has a <i>future</i> aspect, and the general allegation of consequent incapacity to attend to <i>affairs</i> is confined to the past; the idea of any probable future incapacity is impliedly negatived. The point involved in the second division ought therefore to be certified in favor of the defendants. (Hodsoll <i>v.</i> Stallbrass, 9 C. and Payne, 63; S.

That, in consequence of the wound, his brain was affected and injured, so that his understanding and memory were impaired. That for some time he was insensible, and his life despaired of; and before his recovery, he suffered much mental and bodily pain. That he was detained in New York, at a distance from his home, and subjected to much expense about his care, support, and maintenance, and had been hindered and prevented for a long period from transacting and attending to his necessary and lawful affairs, by him during all that time to be performed and transacted; and lost and was deprived of great gains, profits, and advantages, which he might and otherwise would have derived and acquired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plea was the general issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the trial, the plaintiff offered to prove, 'that before and up to and at the time of the alleged injury, the particular business in which he was engaged was that of a distiller and manufacturer of turpentine, and that he was largely and extensively engaged in that business.' The plaintiff also offered 'to prove, by a physician who had attended the plaintiff, that when the plaintiff, after his convalescence, left New York to return to North Carolina, he (plaintiff) could not safely attend to any business or occupation, and that the witness deemed it imprudent and indiscreet for the plaintiff thenceforth to devote himself to any business.' To this evidence the defendants' counsel objected, on the ground that the declaration of the plaintiff did not contain any specification of such business, or of its nature or extent, or contain any statement that the plaintiff was obliged or did relinquish or abandon the same. The judges were divided in opinion as to the admissibility of such evidence, and have certified the questions for the decision of this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The precise object for which this evidence was adduced is not stated in the certificate of the judges; but if the evidence tends to support any issue between the parties, or has a direct connection with other evidence competent to maintain the averments of the declaration, either to illustrate its meaning or to ascertain its probative effect, it cannot be rejected as impertinent, or as founded upon matter that does not appear in the pleadings of the cause. The evidence objected to conduces to prove that the plaintiff was seriously injured; that he had been confined in New York, at a distance from his home, and had incurred expense in consequence. That, before that time, he had been concerned in conducting a business that required a degree of mental and bodily vigor, and that his time was of some pecuniary value; or, that he had suffered a loss of some profit; and that, after some detention in New York, he had returned to his house in an infirm condition&#8212;so infirm that his medical attendant and adviser deemed him incapable of pursuing any ordinary business or occupation, and had advised him to abstain from personal exertion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence would certainly assist a jury to determine that the plaintiff had sustained an injury of no slight character&#8212;an injury to his person, and which was followed by expense, suffering, and loss of time, which had for him a pecuniary value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These were the direct and necessary consequences of the injury, and sustained strictly and almost exclusively as an effect from it. This evidence may have an application without any inquiry into any remote or contingent consequences which could not have been foreseen, or which were peculiar to the circumstances or condition of the plaintiff. The record does not inform us that the evidence was designed to aid in such irrelevant inquiries, and we cannot presume that, if admitted, the court would allow any misconstruction of its legal import, or any use of it by the jury, contrary to law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The opinion of the court is, that the evidence is competent, and we direct that the certificate to the Circuit Court shall be made accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "id": 87124, "judges": "", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/87124/", "sha1": "6533005d46598aada608297115273e62a9322f27", "source": "R", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:01:00"}
