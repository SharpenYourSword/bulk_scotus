SMITH, USE OF CALEB CUSHING, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR,<br>\nv.<br>\nTHE CORPORATION OF WASHINGTON.</h1></center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center></center>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*139</span> It was argued by Mr. Gillet and Mr. Cushing for the plaintiff in error, and Mr. Carlisle for the defendants.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*146</span> Mr. Justice GRIER delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>The declaration in this case alleges, in substance, that the plaintiff is owner of a lot in the city of Washington, fronting on K street; that this street was opened in front of her lot in the year 1831, and became a travelled street; that a wall had been erected in front of the lot, to protect it; that shade trees had been planted in front it; that a sidewalk had been laid; \"that defendants unlawfully, wrongfully, and injuriously,\" cut down the shade trees, took down the wall, removed the pavement, and dug down the street in front of the premises, thereby obstructing and injuring the ingress and egress to plaintiff's lot and the buildings thereon \u0097 injuring their value, depriving her of the shade and ornament of the trees, and compelling her to pay large sums of money to enable her to use and occupy her house.</p>\n<p>It must be observed that the gravamen of this case is not a trespass on the property of the plaintiff, or the taking down a wall or removing shade trees thereon; nor the erection of a nuisance on the public highway; nor a wilful, malicious, or oppressive abuse of authority, in order to injure the plaintiff. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*147</span> But the declaration charges that these acts of defendants, in reducing the level of the street, removing trees, pavement, &amp;c., were done \"unlawfully, wrongfully, and injuriously.\"</p>\n<p>On the pleadings and evidence in the case, the only questions of law that did or could arise on it, were \u0097</p>\n<p>1st. Whether the corporation, defendant, had power to change the grade of the street, or acted \"unlawfully and wrongfully\" in so doing; and,</p>\n<p>2d. If the act was lawful, were the defendants bound to compensate the plaintiff for the injurious consequences to her property?</p>\n<p>1. First, then, as to the authority of the corporation.</p>\n<p>It is unnecessary, in the consideration of this point, to recur to the early history of the foundation of the city of Washington; suffice to say, the land was originally conveyed to trustees, \"to be laid out as a federal city, with such streets, &amp;c., as the President shall approve.\" It has been so laid out, and the streets dedicated to the public. As in all other cities and towns, the legal title to the public streets is vested in the sovereign, as trustee for the public; and consequently in this District they can be regulated only by Congress, directly, or by such individuals or corporations as are authorized by Congress.</p>\n<p>The act to incorporate the city of Washington, passed May 15th, 1820, among other specific powers and duties enumerated in the seventh section, has the following: \"To open and keep in repair streets, avenues, lanes, alleys, &amp;c., &amp;c., agreeably to the plan of the city.\"</p>\n<p>It has been contended that this power, \"to open and keep in repair,\" does not include the power to alter the grade or change the level of the land on which the streets, by the plan of the city, are laid out.</p>\n<p>But we think such a construction of this clause of the charter is entirely too narrow, and cannot be supported as consonant either with the letter or spirit of the statute. It is the evident intention and policy of this statute to commit to this corporation, as a municipal organ of government, whose members are chosen by the citizens, the care, supervision, and general regulation of the streets, as in other cities and boroughs.</p>\n<p>Where sums of money have been specially voted by Congress for the improvement of the city, it is usual to order it to be expended under the supervision of the President. But no inference can be drawn from such legislation, that Congress intended to retain the whole police and regulation of the streets to itself, so as to require a special act to alter the grade of a street, or that the President, in addition to his other duties, has imposed on him that of street commissioner of Washington. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*148</span> The city corporation has the trust confided to them, and the duty imposed upon them, not only of opening the streets of Washington, but of \"keeping them in repair.\"</p>\n<p>Streets cannot be opened and kept in repair, or made safe or convenient for public use, without being made level, or as nearly so as the nature of the ground will permit. Hills must be cut down and hollows filled up, or, in other words, the road must be \"graded\" or \"reduced to a certain degree of ascent or descent;\" which is the proper definition of the verb \"to grade.\" If the duty imposed on the corporation requires this to be done, the power must be coextensive with the duty. If charged with neglect of their duty, as public officers bound to keep the streets in repair, it would not be a sufficient excuse to allege that the fences and obstructions are removed, and therefore the street is \"opened,\" or that it has been kept in as good \"repair\" as it was found.</p>\n<p>A Court of Quarter Sessions would probably not receive a defence founded on such astute philological criticism of the terms of the statute. Nor could the allegation be admitted, that having once fixed a grade, which is now found improper and insufficient, the corporation has exhausted its power, and has no authority to change the level or grade, in order to keep the street in repair. As the duty is a continuing one, so is the power necessary to perform it.</p>\n<p>2. Having performed this trust, confided to them by the law, according to the best of their judgment and discretion, without exceeding the jurisdiction and authority vested in them as agents of the public, and on land dedicated to public use for the purposes of a highway, they have not acted \"unlawfully or wrongfully,\" as charged in the declaration. They have not trespassed on the plaintiff's property, nor erected a nuisance injurious to it, and are, consequently, not liable to damages where they have committed no wrong, but have fulfilled a duty imposed on them by law as agents of the public. The plaintiff may have suffered inconvenience and been put to expense in consequence of such action; yet, as the act of defendants is not \"unlawful or wrongful,\" they are not bound to make any recompense. It is what the law styles \"damnum absque injuria.\" Private interests must yield to public accommodation; one cannot build his house on the top of a hill in the midst of a city, and require the grade of the street to conform to his convenience, at the expense of that of the public.</p>\n<p>The law on this subject is well settled, both in England and this country. The cases are too numerous for quotation; a reference to one or two more immediately applicable to the questions arising in this case will be sufficient.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*149</span> In Callender v. Marsh, (1 Pick., 417,) the defendant, as surveyor of the highways, was charged with digging down a street in Boston, so as to lay bare the foundations of plaintiff's house, and endanger its falling. The authority under which he acted was given by a statute which required \"that all highways, townways, &amp;c., should be kept in repair and amended from time to time, that the same may be safe and convenient for travellers.\" \"This very general and exclusive authority,\" say the court, \"would seem to include everything which may be needed towards making the ways perfect and complete, either by levelling them where they are uneven and difficult of ascent, or raising them where they should be sunken and miry.\" It was held, also, that the law does not give a right to compensation for an indirect or consequential damage or expense, resulting from a right use of property belonging to the public.</p>\n<p>In Green v. The Borough of Reading. (9 Watts, 282.)</p>\n<p>The defendants, by virtue of their authority to \"improve and repair,\" graded the street in front of plaintiff's house five feet higher than it had been before, and it was held that the corporation was not liable to an action for any consequential injury to plaintiff's property, by reason of such improvement or change of grade in the public street.</p>\n<p>In the case of O'Connor v. Pittsburg, (18 Penn. Rep., 187,) a church had been built according to the direction of the city regulator, and by a grade established in 1829. Afterwards, in pursuance of an ordinance, the grade of the street was reduced seventeen feet; the church had to be taken down and rebuilt on a lower foundation, at a damage of $4,000. The authority given to the city was \"to improve, repair, and keep in order the streets,\" &amp;c.</p>\n<p>The court say, \"We had this case reargued, in order to discover, if possible, some way to relieve the plaintiff consistently with law, but grieve to say we can find none. The law is settled, not only in Pennsylvania, but by every decision in the sister States, except one.\"</p>\n<p>We are of opinion, therefore, that the instructions given by the court below on these points were correct, and affirm their judgment.</p>\n</div>",

If the defendants acted in good faith, they would deal with the people in Franklin Row as they did with those in other parts of the city. The defendants had offered proof that the first grade of K street, in front of plaintiff's house, was steep. Thereupon, the plaintiff offered to prove that it was not as steep as other grades which the corporation has fixed in other parts of the city. This evidence was objected to by the defendants, and rejected by the court, and the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence clearly tended to show, if it was not conclusive, that the defendants applied a different rule in other parts of the city from that which they enforced upon the plaintiff. The evidence offered raised a presumption against the defendants, and it rested with them to repel it by other evidence, if they could. It prejudiced the plaintiff to reject it altogether, and therefore the exception ought to be sustained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SECOND.&#8212;<i>That the first establishment of a grade raises a presumption that such grade was the proper one; and to justify a change, the defendants were bound to show a change of circumstances, and the occurrence of a new and further necessity, to justify a regrading</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the grading in 1831 or 1832, which was proved to be a proper grade, by the acts of the defendants as well as by witnesses, it was incumbent upon the defendants to show some reason for a regrade, other that their neglect in letting the street get out of repair. They offered none of a material character. They ordered the regrade by the act of August 11th, 1851, without any substantial or plausible reason. It was the exercise of power without any reasonable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regrading under the act of the 12th of September, 1851, is wholly without a pretence of excuse. They had fixed the grade and gravelled the street; neither the elements nor any other cause had changed it, or proved it unsuitable. There was no change of circumstances, and no occurrence of any new or further necessity for a change of what they had made as good and sufficient. It was a wanton exercise of power, without any assignable good motive. It laid the foundation for the assumption that the defendants did not act in good faith. It raised that presumption, and it rested with them to repel it, which they did not attempt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THIRD.&#8212;<i>The payment of damages to a portion of those injured residing in Franklin Row, authorized the presumption that the defendants did not act in good faith</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants, as a corporation, derive their powers under the seventh and eighth sections of the act of 1820. (3 U. S. S., 586, 587.) There is no power conferred upon them to make gratuties; to do so would be a wanton violation of duty. They cannot assume that they thus acted in paying Ratcliffe $425 towards his loss. This was an acknowledgment that they had acted wrongfully in the cutting down, and were liable for the injury. It was an admission that they acted without lawful cause, and had no legal justification, and raised a clear presumption against them, which they did not attempt to repel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FOURTH.&#8212;<i>The condition in which the defendants left the street for a long time, raised the presumption against the good faith of their acts</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Ratcliffe testified, that 'after the defendants cut down the street, we were left in the mud a year or so.' The fact of cutting down the street, and leaving it in the condition described, raises a presumption that it was not done to improve the street and make it more passable. It was incumbent upon the defendants to repel this presumption by proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FIFTH.&#8212;<i>The court erred in instructing the jury that the plaintiff could not recover without proving that the change in the street was made 'wantonly, wilfully, and maliciously</i>.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first instruction prayed by the defendants, the court told the jury, as a matter of law, that if the defendants acted in good faith in the regrading, the plaintiff could not recover. The plaintiff had given evidence tending to show, unexplained, a want of good faith, and especially the order for the second regrading, within about a month after the first regrading, and her counsel commenced to sum up the facts before the jury, to show that the defendants did not act <i>bona fide</i>. Thereupon the defendants' counsel interrupted, and prayed a further instruction, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'And thereupon, the plaintiff's counsel insisting before the jury that the said grade was not made by the said defendants <i>bona fide</i>, the defendants now pray the court further to instruct the jury, that the defendants cannot be responsible in damages in this action, unless from the evidence the jury shall find that the said change was made wantonly, wilfully, and maliciously; which instruction the said court gave as prayed.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this there was an exception. The jury of course found, under this instruction, for the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>a</i>. Here was a change of ground by defendants during the trial, and one assumed under which the plaintiff could not be expected to prevail. It presented, in effect, a new issue, not raised by the plea of the 'general issue.'<i>b</i>. It avoided the question of the power of the defendants to regrade, as they had done, as well as that of <i>bona fides</i>, and threw upon the plaintiff the burden of proving matters essentially different. These matters relate not to the right to recover, but simply to the extent of the recovery. The decision, in substance, was, that the question of power was not to be looked at, but that the plaintiff must make proof that the act was done 'wantonly, wilfully, and maliciously.' Under this decision, if the defendants had no power whatever, but had been in fact forbidden by law to do the act complained of, they might not have acted wantonly, wilfully, or maliciously. They might have mistaken the law, or never have seen or heard of it, or acted upon the supposition that they might do whatever they chose; and in either of these cases they would have escaped all responsibility, thus making the plaintiff sustain all the loss, because of their blunders or want of knowledge. Such a rule would work mischief without end. It would be a justification of nearly or quite all the acts of public functionaries, if not of private individuals, of which so much complaint has been made. It would justify courts and officers acting without jurisdiction, if they did not act maliciously. It would, in effect, make the right to recover, in all cases of tort, depend upon the motive which led to its commission, and throw upon the plaintiff the burden of proving that such motive had its origin in malice. A more mischievous rule of action was never maintained and urged before a judicial tribunal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>c</i>. Under the instruction, the issue framed by the pleadings was changed. The declaration charged that the defendants had injured her property without authority of law, and the plea denied the allegation. The parties went to trial upon that issue. The court, on the trial, made a different one, and directed the jury that they must find three other charges against the defendants before the plaintiff could recover:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1st. That the defendants had acted wantonly&#8212;that is, wholly without regard to restraints or consequences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2d. That they acted wilfully&#8212;that is, obstinately and stubbornly wrong, not yielding to reason; but by design, and with the purpose of doing injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3d. That they acted maliciously&#8212;that is, with extreme enmity of heart&#8212;with malevolence, and with a disposition to injure the plaintiff without cause&#8212;with unprovoked malignity or spite. A malicious injury has been defined to be: 'An injury committed out of spite or ill-will against another; an injury committed wantonly, wilfully, and without cause.' (2 Burrell L. Dic., 698; 1 Chit. Gen. Pr., 136.) Wantonness is defined by Bouvier (2 v. L.

(Head <i>v.</i> Providence Ins. Co., 2 Cr., 121; Mechanics' Bank of Alexandria <i>v.</i> Bank of Columbia, 5 Wheat., 326.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only power conferred upon the corporation of Washington on this subject is found in the 7th section of the act of May 15th, 1820, (3 U. S. L., 5687,) and is in these words:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The said corporation shall have full power and authority to * * * erect and repair bridges; to open and keep in repair streets, avenues, lanes, alleys, drains, and sewers, agreeably to the plan of the city, to supply the city with water,' &amp;c.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This provision recognises the known historical fact, that at an early day there was prepared and adopted a plan of the city of Washington, wherein the streets, alleys, lanes, &amp;c., were drawn, and the grade of the streets and avenues above tide water accurately laid down. The elevations of the original grades are shown in the diagram in this case, admitted in the stipulation, and is proved by Cluskey's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grades having been previously established, the power conferred in relation to streets and avenues was 'to open and keep in repair,' and not to grade. The intention of Congress was to authorize the city government to carry into effect the plan of the engineers who laid out the city, and of General Washington, who approved of it. It was not the intention to authorize that elaborate work to be broken up and defeated, in conformity to the caprices which might at any time spring into existence in the city government. Hence the limitation of the power conferred. It neither authorizes the opening a street, nor fixing its grade, but permits opening 'agreeably to the plan of the city,' which contained the grade of every street, avenue, &amp;c. The city cannot lay out a new street, nor fix the grade of an old one. Its power does not extend to either.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the charter does authorize the city 'to cause new alleys to be opened through the squares, and to extend those already laid out, upon the application of the owners of more than one-half of the property in such squares.' (Sec. 8, p. 587.)But this can only be done by paying those injured the losses they sustain, which is to be collected of those whose property shall be benefited, as equity and justice require. This provision in relation to lanes shows that Congress did not intend to arm the city with the power of injuring the property of individuals, without requiring it to make just compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This law is entirely different from the Georgetown act, construed in Gosler <i>v.</i> The Corporation of Georgetown, 6 Wheat., 593. The Legislature conferred upon the corporation of Georgetown 'full power and authority to make such by-laws and ordinances, for the graduation and levelling of the streets, lanes, and alleys, within the jurisdiction of the same town, as they may judge necessary for the benefit thereof.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this provision, a by-law was passed to grade the streets, in which it was declared that forever thereafter the grade thus established should be regarded in making improvements in the streets. Subsequently, the corporation passed a new law, changing the grade. The plaintiff claimed to be injured by the change, and brought suit upon the ground that the corporation had, by the first law, contracted not to disturb the first grade. The court held that it was not a compact, and that the power to make by-laws and ordinances was a continuing power. Marshall, C. J., said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The power is not 'to graduate and level the streets,' or 'to make a by-law for the graduation and levelling of the streets;' but 'to make such by-laws and ordinances for the graduation and levelling of the streets,' &amp;c., within the jurisdiction of the same town, as they may judge necessary for the benefit thereof.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He placed the decision upon the ground, that the corporation was clothed with power to act, when they judged it to be necessary for the benefit of the town.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The power in that case was necessarily a continuing power, to be exercised when the corporation thought necessary. There was no limitation as in this case. It is clear that the Chief Justice was of opinion, that if the power had been to 'grade and level,' or to make a by-law for doing so, it would not have been a continuing power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, there being no express power to grade streets, it is claimed that the authority to open streets not only confers that power, but that it continues, and may be exercised without limit, except upon proof of malice. But the power to open is not a continuing power, because when once opened a street cannot be opened again. The power to repair does not include that of establishing a new grade. That term means simply to restore what has been injured to its original condition. Bouvier (2 v. L. Dic., 447) says, that 'repairs' means 'that work which is done to an estate to keep it in good order.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear, that when a street is once opened it cannot be regraded under the power to open, and that under the authority to repair nothing can be done but to restore it to its original condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But if the power to open authorized the grading, when it was once exercised the power would be exhausted, and could not be exercised a second time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The counsel for the plaintiff in error referred also to the following authorities:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

The corporation of Washington had power, under its charter, to regrade this street. Its power in this respect is a continuing power, to be exercised, <i>toties quoties</i>, as the public convenience may require. (Gorzler <i>v.</i> The Corporation of Georgetown, 6 Wheat., 593; Act of Assembly of Md., 1797, ch. 56, sec. 6; Van Ness and ux. <i>v.</i> The U.

The corporation had no power, even by an express ordinance, or contract in any form, to bind itself not to change or alter the grade of the street, even if such grade should be, by the same ordinance or contract, or in any other manner, established. And it follows, of course, that there can be no implied contract, such as is imputed to the corporation, in the premises. The plaintiff could not have acquired any right, by convention, grant, prescription, or contract, express or implied, to have the old grade of the street maintained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This follows from the preceding point, and is sustained by the same reason and authorities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III. The case made by the plaintiff in error is one of mere <i>damnum absque injuria</i>. It shows no invasion of any right, but simply a damage resulting from the <i>bona fide</i> and careful exercise of a lawful authority for the public good. The supposed right of the plaintiff, of the invasion of which she complains, is a right <i>ex jure naturae</i> to build a house on the top of a hill in the midst of a city, and to require the city to conform perpetually to her convenience, at the expense of the convenience of everybody else; a right to keep a nuisance; to insist on an impracticable grade of a public street; to destroy the value of all the surrounding lots of ground, in order that she may have more convenient access to the house so built. But it, in any case, such right, <i>ex jure naturae</i>, could be maintained, certainly it does not exist in the city of Washington, where all titles to city lots are held from a common source, and subject to common conditions and liabilities; the original proprietors having conveyed their lands to trustees 'to be laid out for a federal city, with such streets, &amp;c., as the President of the United States for the time being shall approve.' (Burch's Digest, 331; 4 Peters, 283.) The plaintiff was simply the owner of a city lot, as such.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That no action lies in such case, results from the fact that no injury, no violation of her right, has occurred.

But the declaration charges that these acts of defendants, in reducing the level of the street, removing trees, pavement, &amp;c., were done 'unlawfully, wrongfully, and injuriously.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the pleadings and evidence in the case, the only questions of law that did or could arise on it, were&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1st. Whether the corporation, defendant, had power to change the grade of the street, or acted 'unlawfully and wrongfully' in so doing; and,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2d. If the act was lawful, were the defendants bound to compensate the plaintiff for the injurious consequences to her property?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. First, then, as to the authority of the corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unnecessary, in the consideration of this point, to recur to the early history of the foundation of the city of Washington; suffice to say, the land was originally conveyed to trustees, 'to be laid out as a federal city, with such streets, &amp;c., as the President shall approve.' It has been so laid out, and the streets dedicated to the public. As in all other cities and towns, the legal title to the public streets is vested in the sovereign, as trustee for the public; and consequently in this District they can be regulated only by Congress, directly, or by such individuals or corporations as are authorized by Congress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The act to incorporate the city of Washington, passed May 15th, 1820, among other specific powers and duties enumerated in the seventh section, has the following: '<i>To open and keep in repair</i> streets, avenues, lanes, alleys, &amp;c., &amp; c., agreeably to the plan of the city.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has been contended that this power, 'to open and keep in repair,' does not include the power to alter the grade or change the level of the land on which the streets, by the plan of the city, are laid out.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But we think such a construction of this clause of the charter is entirely too narrow, and cannot be supported as consonant either with the letter or spirit of the statute. It is the evident intention and policy of this statute to commit to this corporation, as a municipal organ of government, whose members are chosen by the citizens, the care, supervision, and general regulation of the streets, as in other cities and boroughs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where sums of money have been specially voted by Congress for the improvement of the city, it is usual to order it to be expended under the supervision of the President. But no inference can be drawn from such legislation, that Congress intended to retain the whole police and regulation of the streets to itself, so as to require a special act to alter the grade of a street, or that the President, in addition to his other duties, has imposed on him that of street commissioner of Washington. The city corporation has the trust confided to them, and the duty imposed upon them, not only of opening the streets of Washington, but of 'keeping them in repair.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Streets cannot be opened and kept in repair, or made safe or convenient for public use, without being made level, or as nearly so as the nature of the ground will permit. Hills must be cut down and hollows filled up, or, in other words, the road must be '<i>graded</i>' or 'reduced to a certain degree of ascent or descent;' which is the proper definition of the verb 'to grade.' If the duty imposed on the corporation requires this to be done, the power must be coextensive with the duty. If charged with neglect of their duty, as public officers bound to keep the streets in repair, it would not be a sufficient excuse to allege that the fences and obstructions are removed, and therefore the street is 'opened,' or that it has been kept in as good 'repair' as it was found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A Court of Quarter Sessions would probably not receive a defence founded on such astute philological criticism of the terms of the statute. Nor could the allegation be admitted, that having once fixed a grade, which is now found improper and insufficient, the corporation has exhausted its power, and has no authority to change the level or grade, in order to keep the street in repair. As the duty is a continuing one, so is the power necessary to perform it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Having performed this trust, confided to them by the law, according to the best of their judgment and discretion, without exceeding the jurisdiction and authority vested in them as agents of the public, and on land dedicated to public use for the purposes of a highway, they have not acted 'unlawfully or wrongfully,' as charged in the declaration. They have not trespassed on the plaintiff's property, nor erected a nuisance injurious to it, and are, consequently, not liable to damages where they have committed no wrong, but have fulfilled a duty imposed on them by law as agents of the public. The plaintiff may have suffered inconvenience and been put to expense in consequence of such action; yet, as the act of defendants is not 'unlawful or wrongful,' they are not bound to make any recompense. It is what the law styles '<i>damnum absque injuria</i>.' Private interests must yield to public accommodation; one cannot build his house on the top of a hill in the midst of a city, and require the grade of the street to conform to his convenience, at the expense of that of the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law on this subject is well settled, both in England and this country. The cases are too numerous for quotation; a reference to one or two more immediately applicable to the questions arising in this case will be sufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Callender <i>v.</i> Marsh, (1 Pick., 417,) the defendant, as surveyor of the highways, was charged with digging down a street in Boston, so as to lay bare the foundations of plaintiff's house, and endanger its falling. The authority under which he acted was given by a statute which required 'that all highways, townways, &amp;c., should be <i>kept in repair and amended</i> from time to time, that the same may be safe and convenient for travellers.' 'This very general and exclusive authority,' say the court, 'would seem to include everything which may be needed towards making the ways perfect and complete, either by levelling them where they are uneven and difficult of ascent, or raising them where they should be sunken and miry.' It was held, also, that the law does not give a right to compensation for an indirect or consequential damage or expense, resulting from a right use of property belonging to the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Green <i>v.</i> The Borough of Reading, (9 Watts, 282.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants, by virtue of their authority to '<i>Improve and repair</i>,' graded the street in front of plaintiff's house five feet higher than it had been before, and it was held that the corporation was not liable to an action for any consequential injury to plaintiff's property, by reason of such improvement or change of grade in the public street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of O'Connor <i>v.</i> Pittsburg, (18 Penn. Rep., 187,) a church had been built according to the direction of the city regulator, and by a grade established in 1829. Afterwards, in pursuance of an ordinance, the grade of the street was reduced seventeen feet; the church had to be taken down and rebuilt on a lower foundation, at a damage of $4,000. The authority given to the city was '<i>to improve, repair, and keep in order the streets</i>,' &amp;c.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court say, 'We had this case reargued, in order to discover, if possible, some way to relieve the plaintiff consistently with law, but grieve to say we can find none. The law is settled, not only in Pennsylvania, but by every decision in the sister States, except one.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are of opinion, therefore, that the instructions given by the court below on these points were correct, and affirm their judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
