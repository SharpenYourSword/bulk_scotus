The judge then replied, \"Mr. Mussina has a right to an appeal, and I will allow it as a matter of course, when the opposing counsel shall appear, and I will fix the amount of the bond.\" It is his practice to allow appeals in the presence of counsel. Mr. Hale, the counsel for the defendants, lives in Galveston, near to the place where the court was held, and was daily in court. No application seems to have been made in court on the subject of the appeal; no citation was presented to the district judge; no bond for his approval.

Simon Mussina, on whose oath the rule was entered, was agent for Jacob Mussina, Angela Garcia Lafon Tarneva, who were also defendants, and he desired that these persons might be allowed an appeal, and also the other defendants, so as to remove the case to the Supreme Court.

John C. Watrous, judge of the District Court of the United States for the eastern district of Texas, to show cause, &amp;c.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Benjamin</i>, of counsel for the said Jacob Mussina and Angela Garcia Lafon de Tarneva, appellants as aforesaid, and two of the defendants in the above-entitled cause, moved the court for a rule on the Hon. John C. Watrous, judge of the District Court of the United States for the eastern district of Texas, requiring him to show cause, on the first Monday of February next, why a peremptory writ of mandamus should not issue, directing him to allow the appeal of the said defendants from the final decree rendered against them in the above-entitled cause, and to grant all such legal orders as may be necessary to enable said defendants to bring said appeal regularly before this court. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered by the court that a rule on the Hon. John C. Watrous, judge of the District Court of the United States for the eastern district of Texas, requiring him to show cause, on the first Monday of February next, why a peremptory writ of mandamus should not issue for the purposes above stated, be, and the same is hereby, granted. And it is further ordered, that a copy of this rule be forthwith served on the said district judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>December</i> 24, 1857.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A copy of this rule was served upon Judge Watrous, when he filed the following answer:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In answer to a rule recently made by this court, requiring me      to show cause why a peremptory writ of mandamus should not be      issued, commanding me to allow the appeal of Jacob Mussina      and Maria Angela Garcia de Tarneva, two of the defendants in      a cause heretofore mentioned, in the District Court of the      United States for the district of Texas, I most respectfully      state that I am now ready to allow said appeal, and always      have been. That I have never been disposed to oppose or      hinder it. My desire has always been that my decision in the      case should be revised by this honorable court, where, if it      was right, it would be affirmed, and where any error into      which I may have fallen will be at once detected and      reformed. Some time before the 15th day of January, 1857, Mr.      Daniel D. Atchison, of Galveston, stated to me at chambers      that he wished to take an appeal for Mussina, in the Cavazos      case. I asked him whether the time limited for taking appeals      had expired or not. He said that it had not. I then replied,      'Mr. Mussina has a right to the appeal, and I will give it to      him, as a matter of course. Call it up in the court-house at      any time when the opposing counsel is present, and I will fix      the amount of the bond and perfect the appeal.' It has been      my practice, whenever it is convenient, to hear both sides as      to the amount of the bond. The opposing counsel, Mr. Hale,      resided in Galveston&#8212;his office is but a very short distance      from the court-house. The court at the time of the      application was in session, and Mr. Hale was in daily      attendance upon it. Notice might have been served upon him      very easily, at any time. If notice had been served upon him,      I should have proceeded without his presence and perfected the appeal.      But I was never informed that Mr. Hale had notice of the      application. No citations were ever presented to me for      signature&#8212;no bond for my approval.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I have no recollection that the application was ever renewed to me, either in open court or at chambers. The conversation which occurred at my office, between Mr. Atchison and myself, as above stated, is the only one of which I have any remembrance. I do not say that the appeal was never brought to my notice in open court, but I do say, that if it ever was, I do not remember it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The session of the court continued for several weeks, and I believe months, after the application of Mr. Atchison was made to me. Mr. Hale was in almost constant attendance upon the court in attention to his business, and it would have been very easy for Mr. Atchison to present the matter to the court when Mr. Hale was present. If he had done so, I should, without the least hesitation, have proceeded to do anything necessary to perfect the appeal. If he had stated that he could not procure the attendance of Mr. Hale, or could not wait further for his attendance without injury to his client, I should have proceeded to act on the application at once. The intervention of this court is entirely unnecessary, as I am ready at any moment, when requested, to proceed to approve a proper and sufficient appeal bond, and to sign a proper citation; and even if I should not be satisfied with the bond which might be presented to me, and should refuse to approve it, the parties affected by such refusal could at once obtain their appeal from any of the judges of this court, either during the term or afterwards. I submit, therefore, that the rule should be discharged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JOHN C.

Atchison, Esq., brought into the clerk's office of said court a paper purporting to be a petition of Jacob Mussina and others, to join in an appeal theretofore taken in the above-entitled cause. Affiant believes that this was in the afternoon of said day, and the endorsement of filing made on that day is in my handwriting. I was present when the petition was presented to Judge Watrous by Mr. Atchison. His honor asked him if the five years allowed by law for taking an appeal had expired? Mr. Atchison replied, 'No.' Judge Watrous then replied, as near as I can remember, in these words: 'Certainly, sir, I will grant your request, and any day you will get the opposing counsel and come to me, I will fix the bond and perfect the appeal.' It was my duty to be in court whilst it was in session, and I was there during the greater part of the time. F. J. Parker officiated in the absence of the clerk and myself. To the best of my remembrance and belief, no application for appeal in said cause was made in open court, front the 13th to the 16th of January, inclusive. I believe I was in court, on those days, all the time it was in session.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">J. E.

D. Atchison, or any other, for appeal in the above cause, on any of those days. I further state, that I was not in court all the time of its session on the days named, but was never absent without leaving one or both of my deputies, F. J. Parker and Joseph E. Love, with strict injunctions that one of them should always be at the clerk's table. The court opened at 10 A. M., at 2 P. M., with an uniformity I have not seen equalled.

I further state that, at the said term of said court, I was acting as deputy clerk of the same for James Love, the clerk of the court, at Galveston, and that it was my custom always to be present during the absence of the said James Love, or J.

John C. Watrous, judge of said court, on the 15th day of January, 1852, and that an appeal was taken from said final decree by said Shannon on the 30th July, 1856, which appeal is now pending in this honorable court; that at the last term of this honorable court, to wit, in the month of December, 1856, this affiant retained the services of counsel for the argument of said cause in this court in behalf of said Shannon, and that, on examination of the record, this deponent was advised by said counsel that the said appeal had been taken irregularly, and would be dismissed for this, to wit, that the said final decree was joint against the several defendants in said suit, and that the co-defendants of said Shannon had not joined in the appeal, nor been notified to join; that thereupon this deponent, being desirous to perfect said appeal in behalf of said Shannon, and also desirous to make said Jacob Mussina and Angela Tarneva joint appellants with him, did, prior to the expiration of five years from the date of said final decree, to wit, in the month of January last, (1857,) and several days before the fifteenth day of said month, cause to be presented to the said Judge Watrous, in chambers, a petition of appeal in the name and behalf of said Jacob Mussina and Angela Tarneva from said final decree, and in said petition prayed for a citation of all parties in interest, to the end that said co-defendant, Patrick C. Shannon, might join in said appeal, and that all the other co-defendants might also join or refuse to join in said appeal; and said petition of appeal further contained an offer to give such appeal bond as might be required by said Judge Watrous; as the whole will more fully appear by reference to a duly-certified copy of said petition of appeal, hereunto appended as part of the affidavits, marked A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And this affiant doth further depose, that the said honorable judge declined at the time of said presentation of said petition to allow said appeal, or to order the other parties in interest to be cited, or to fix the amount of or approve any appeal bond, but declared that he would consider the subject, and report his decision to the attorney who signed said petition of appeal; that after the lapse of some days, without any decision having been given as promised by said judge, he was again requested in open court, and, prior to the said fifteenth day of January last, and by the said attorney who had signed said petition of appeal, to allow said appeal and grant said order of citation, and approve an appeal bond as aforesaid; but said Judge Watrous again declined to allow said appeal or grant any order in the premises, saying he would fix the amount of bond to be given by petitioners when the opposite counsel should be in court; and this deponent further saith that the said John C. Watrous, judge as aforesaid, hath not yet allowed said appeal, but declines and neglects to allow the same, or to grant any order for citations as aforesaid, or to approve any appeal bond, so that, without the aid and interposition of this honorable court, the said Patrick C.

This rule was granted on the affidavit of Simon Mussina, as agent for a part of the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his answer the judge says, 'I am now ready to allow the appeal, and always have been; that some time before the 15th day of January, 1857, Mr. Daniel Atchison, of Galveston, stated to him, at chambers, that he wished to take an appeal for Jacob Mussina in the above case, and that the judge inquired whether the time limited for taking appeals had expired, and was informed it had not. The judge then replied, 'Mr. Mussina has a right to an appeal, and I will allow it as a matter of course, when the opposing counsel shall appear, and I will fix the amount of the bond.' It is his practice to allow appeals in the presence of counsel. Mr. Hale, the counsel for the defendants, lives in Galveston, near to the place where the court was held, and was daily in court. No application seems to have been made in court on the subject of the appeal; no citation was presented to the district judge; no bond for his approval. The conversation with Mr. Atchison, at the chambers of the judge, respecting the appeal, is all that was said to him on the subject.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If it were mentioned in open court, he has no recollection of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The clerk of the court, the deputy clerk, the crier, the marshal of the United States and his deputy, who were in attendance on the court, all corroborate, on oath, the statement of the judge, and say no application was made in open court for the appeal; and no entry on the docket is found of such an application. From the certified copy of the petition for an appeal, it does not appear to have been filed, or that an entry of it was made on the docket.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party wishing an appeal should make an application for its allowance in open court, or to the judge at his chambers, and should name his securities. And the bond should be prepared for the approval of the judge, and the citation for his signature, unless the appeal was prayed in open court and entered upon the record. It appears the decree in question was entered jointly against several defendants, and that an appeal by Patrick C. Shannon only, who was one of the defendants, was taken. Simon Mussina, on whose oath the rule was entered, was agent for Jacob Mussina, Angela Garcia Lafon Tarneva, who were also defendants, and he desired that these persons might be allowed an appeal, and also the other defendants, so as to remove the case to the Supreme Court. At this time, the cause was pending in the Supreme Court, on the appeal taken by Shannon. That appeal was irregular, as less than all the defendants in a joint decree cannot appeal without a summons and severance in the court below. And this was not done on Shannon's appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regular mode of proceeding would have been to dismiss the appeal in this court, pray for another appeal in the court below, and for a summons and severance, so that the defendants desirous of an appeal might take it, without the concurrence of those defendants who were opposed to it. Had the appeal been prayed in open court, and entered upon the record, the judge below might well have refused it, as the legal steps for its allowance were not taken. Under such circumstances, it was the duty of the judge to act in the presence of the opposing counsel. (Owing et al. <i>v.</i> Kincannon, 7 Peters, 399; Todd et al. <i>v.</i> Daniel, 16 Peters, 521.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether an application might not have been made to this court to correct the irregularity of the appeal, is not before us under the rule for the mandamus. The writ is refused.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
