To all of which findings, rulings, decisions, and opinions, defendants then and there excepted, and prayed that this their bill of exceptions might be sealed, signed, and made of record; which is done, &amp;c.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Exceptions allowed, January 24, 1855.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'THOMAS DRUMMOND. [SEAL.]'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cause was argued in this court by <i>Mr. Ballance</i>, who assigned various errors, in the judgment of the court below, relative to the merits of the case, and others in the form of proceeding. Amongst the latter, it was alleged that it was error to try the cause without a jury; and, upon the authority of Graham<i>v.</i> Bayne, 18 Howard, 60, he contended that the cause must be remanded for a <i>venire de novo</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Chief Justice TANEY delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a writ of error to the Circuit Court of the United States for the northern district of Illinois.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An action of ejectment was brought by the defendants in error against the plaintiff, for a certain parcel of land described in the declaration, and upon the trial the verdict and judgment were for the plaintiff; a motion was afterwards made to set aside the judgment and for a new trial, and the judgment was accordingly set aside, and a new trial granted upon the terms mentioned in the transcript.
