This was an action of assumpsit, in which the plaintiffs below, the defendants in error, Woodward &amp; Dusenberry, recovered of the defendants below, the plaintiffs in error, Poorman et al., the sum of $4,473.76, being amount of the cash balance of $2,997.67 due to the defendants in error, with interest thereon from December, 1849, to the date of the judgment, with costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The whole amount originally loaned and advanced to Poorman et al. was the sum of $6,000. This loan was made on the joint and several note of Poorman et al. for $15,000, dated Somerset, Ohio, October 24th, 1849, and payable to the order of Woodward &amp; Dusenberry, thirty days after date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. With this note in his hands, Thomas Hood, one of the joint makers thereof, applied to W. &amp; D., in the city of New York, for a loan of $6,000, and requested them to deliver to him their certificate of deposit of that amount, to the credit of John Ritchey, Esq., cashier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Thereupon the note was delivered to W. &amp; D., and on the faith thereof the certificate of deposit was delivered to Hood. Ritchey, the payee, duly endorsed the certificate; and when it was presented, subsequently, by the <i>bona fide</i> holders thereof, to Woodward &amp; Dusenberry, they paid the full amount thereof in cash, according to its tenor and obligation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. The certificate of deposit, so granted, was in effect, as the court below correctly instructed the jury, money, and came within the authority to borrow money&#8212;an authority which Hood had expressly received from the other makers, and which, moreover, he possessed independently as one of the joint makers of the note.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. No restriction or limitation was placed on Hood's power as to the amount of the loan, nor as to the mode, or form, or kind of funds, in which it was to be effected. He had a general authority as joint maker and holder to borrow or raise money on the note, in any way not illegal, for the benefit of himself and his associates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7. The transaction was just the same in legal contemplation and in substance as if he had received the $6,000 in specie or bank bills, or the check of Woodward &amp; Dusenberry, and then deposited the amount with them, and taken their certificate of such deposit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8. The certificate was of the deposit of so much money, and in fact it yielded in money, on presentation, the full sum of $6,000, expressed on its face.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">9. The makers of the note lived in Ohio, where they wanted to use their funds; and for their convenience and accommodation this negotiable certificate of deposit of cash, answering their purpose as cash, was granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">10. The class of cases relied on by the plaintiffs in error, such as Bartlett <i>v.</i> Pintland, (10 Barn. and Cres., 758; Atkins <i>v.</i> Owen, 4 Ad. and Ellis,) merely hold that a naked agent, authorized to receive payment, cannot do so by discharging a debt due from himself to the party by whom the payment should be made. (See observations upon those cases&#8212;Dunlap's Paley's Agency, 284.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has held, in a more analogous case, (Tayloe <i>v.</i> Merchants' Fire Ins. Co., 9 How., 402,) that where the mode of payment is not prescribed, the agent may exercise a discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The brief adopted by <i>Mr. Swayne</i> contained the following more extended notice of the authorities cited by <i>Mr. Stanbery</i>, and also of some American authorities:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It will not do to narrow the question to the simple proposition stated in Mr. Stanbery's brief, viz: whether the certificate is money. It is not necessary to affirm this, to show the transaction binding on all the parties, and the remedy within the count, for money had and received. Hood, having authority to borrow money on this note, had authority to receive anything which, in the usual course of business, is treated as such, and will command it. If he got the money or its equivalent, the object of himself and his principals was attained; and it does not lie in their mouths, after having acquiesced in what was done, and realized the money on the certificate, to dispute their liability, because the money, in form, was not given to Hood at the precise time that he parted with the note.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With all due respect for the learned counsel and his ancient authorities, we submit, that they do not meet this case. Thorold <i>v.</i> Smith was the case of a servant sent to collect a debt due his master, and he received a goldsmith's note and gave a discharge. The note was not paid, the maker becoming insolvent. The question was, 'whether this was good payment to the plaintiff, and was held to turn on the authority conferred on the servant. And it was agreed by the court that this was a matter of evidence to the jury, and that the authority in the servant was to be presumed, if the master did not promptly return the note, and that he 'was acquainted with and acquiesced in what had been done.' And C. J. Holt said that 'any jury at Guildhall would find payment, by a bill, to be a good payment, it being a common practice of the city.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Bartlett <i>v.</i> Pintland, the broker, employed to secure a loss on an insurance policy, set off his own debt to the underwriters, and became bankrupt. This was held not to discharge the liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Atkins <i>v.</i> Owens, the defendant was employed simply to procure an endorsement of a time bill of exchange by a party from whom the plaintiff had received it, and he, the defendant, converted the bill to his own use, without receiving any money upon it. It was held that, though liable in trover, assumpsit for money had and received would not lie.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Nightingale <i>v.</i> Devisone, the defendant had received from Mittivier, who was a bankrupt, the transfer of five hundred pounds East India stock. The plaintiffs, assignees of the bankrupt, brought suit for money had and received. Lord Mansifield said this was a new species of property, and was not money to be recovered in that form of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first case cited, can there be a doubt that, even in that age, if the servant or the master had, in fact, received the money on the goldsmith's note, that the plaintiff in that case would have been estopped? So, in the last case cited, if the defendant had converted the stock into money, is there any question that the action for money had and received would lie? The other two cases do not seem to be at all analogous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It will be observed that in England, especially in the earlier cases, there was a strong disposition to limit the evidence, under the money counts, to strict money transactions. Lord Holt strenuously resisted the then growing practice in trade of treating bankers' cash notes and promissory notes as negotiable, until they were made so by the statute of Anne. But the American authorities have liberalized the doctrine in this respect, to meet the expanded customs of commercial transactions, and have held those money securities which in the common course of business are treated as money, and even bills of exchange and promissory notes, proper evidence under the money counts. They have even gone farther, and sustained this action in cases where there was no negotiable money security received by the defendant, but where, in the nature of the transaction, he ought, in equity, to respond for money received.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, in State Bank <i>v.</i> Hurd, (12 Mass., 172,) an endorsee of a negotiable note recovered against the endorser. The action was also sustained in behalf of the endorsee against the maker (Ramsdell <i>v.</i> Soule, 12 Pick., 126.) And, even where the maker signed the note for the accommodation of the payee. (Cole <i>v.</i> Cushing, 8 Pick., 48.)

And, especially, if, after it was done, they acquiesced by their silence, and availed themselves of the benefits of the transaction, they must be presumed to have authorized it.

Woodward &amp; Dusenberry agreed with Hood to advance, on a pledge of the note, as security, six thousand dollars; and Hood requested them to give to him their certificate of deposit for that sum, to the credit of John Ritchey, cashier; which was done, and Ritchey, as payee, endorsed the paper to Hood. It was subsequently presented for payment by <i>bona fide</i> holders, and Woodward &amp; Dusenberry paid the full amount thereof in cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time the certificate of deposit was given, and endorsed by Ritchey, and the fifteen thousand dollar note delivered to Woodward &amp; Dusenberry, they agreed with Hood that if he should return to them the certificate of deposit, they would then surrender to him the note.

Exceptions were taken to the refusal to give the charge asked for, and to the charge as given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They claimed that the court erred, insisting that a certificate of deposit is in no sense cash or money; it is simply an acknowledgment of a debt, with a promise of payment; that the transaction between Hood and Woodward &amp; Dusenberry was simply the exchange of one form of negotiable security for another; and that this was clearly a breach of trust, and a perversion of the authority to use the note for the loan of money. And they refer to the following authorities in support of this position: Thorold <i>v.</i> Smith, 11 Modern, 71, 87; Bartlett <i>v.</i> Pintland, 10 Barn. and Cress., 758; Atkins <i>v.</i> Owen, 4 Ad. and Ellis, 819; Nightingale <i>v.</i> Devisone, 5 Burr., 2589. Here, Woodward &amp; Dusenberry had six thousand dollars in bank, or a broker's office, and the cashier gave a certificate to that effect, and promised to pay the money to the holder of the certificate who should present it. Hood could have taken out the money the next hour.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A certificate of this kind was a means of advance, that in all probabillity suited these borrowers, who resided in Ohio, quite as well as the gold or silver would have done. It was to the same effect as if Hood had received the money, and deposited the specie, subject to his own check on the cashier of the bank. This certificate was actually paid in cash to the agent of the parties to the note, for such the <i>bona fide</i> holder was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To maintain, as we are asked in effect to do, that a check on a bank, payable at sight, to order, and endorsed in blank, and which an agent, to raise <i>money</i> on negotiable paper, took as money, and which check was presently paid to a <i>bona fide</i> holder by the cashier of the bank, was not money; that the note or bill purchased was not sold for money; that no title passed to the purchaser; and that the principal was not bound by the contract of the agent, would be a startling doctrine in the marts of commerce of this country, where money is usually transferred by bank checks, and may be fairly presumed to change hands on the check being given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We order that the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
