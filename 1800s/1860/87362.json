They do not seem to deny that these are maritime contracts, according to any correct definition of the terms, but rather require us to abandon our whole course of decision on this subject, and return to the fluctuating decisions of English common-law judges, which, it has been truly said, \"are founded on no uniform principle, and exhibit illiberal jealousy and narrow prejudice.\"</p>\n<p>The errors of those decisions have mostly been corrected by legislation in the country of their origin; they have never been adopted in this.</p>\n<p>We do not feel disposed to be again drawn into the discussion of the arguments which counsel have reproduced on this subject.

The whole subject was most thoroughly investigated both by counsel and the court. Everything connected with the history of courts of admiralty, from the reign of Richard the Second to the present day \u0097 everything which the industry, learning, and research, of most able counsel could discover, was brought to our notice.

But in England they cannot have the benefit of this lien or privilege, because courts of common law cannot enforce a lien in rem, and will not permit the court of admiralty to do it. Our District Courts had exercised this jurisdiction without question till the case just mentioned came before this court.

The court decided in that case that a contract to build a ship is not a maritime contract; and though, in countries governed by the civil law, courts of admiralty may have taken jurisdiction of such contracts, yet that in this country they are purely local, and governed by State laws, and should be enforced by their own tribunals. As a cumulative argument, it was stated that the act of Congress of 1789 was not intended to conflict with the rights of the State tribunals to enforce contracts governed by their own laws, and not strictly of a maritime nature; that such contracts were thus considered at the time the Constitution was formed, and had never been previously cognizable in courts of admiralty as within the category of maritime contracts; and that the contest of jurisdiction in that case \"was not so much between rival tribunals as between distinct sovereignties claiming to exercise power over contracts, property, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*495</span> and personal franchises.\" The arguments used in stating the opinion of the court must be referred to the subject before it, and construed in connection with the question to be decided.

MOREWOOD, AND FREDERIC R.<br>ROUTH, APPELLANTS,<br>v.<br>LORENZO N. ENEQUIST, OWNER OF THE BRIG GOTHLAND.</p>\n    <p class=\"date\">December Term, 1859</p>\n    <div class=\"prelims\">\n      <p class=\"indent\">THIS was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United States for the southern district of New York.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was a case in admiralty, arising under the following circumstances:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The brig Gothland, owned by Enequist, was chartered by Burt, Myrtle, &amp; Co., of Batavia, to proceed to Padung, on the island of Sumatra, there to receive a quantity of coffee; to return thence to Batavia and complete her cargo, and deliver the same in New York, freight to be paid by the assignees of the bills of lading on delivery of the cargo.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was admitted that the bills of lading were assigned for value to the appellants, composing the firm of G. B. Morewood &amp; Company.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enequist first filed a libel <i>in rem</i> against the cargo for the amount of the freight; but after some proceedings which it is not necessary to mention, this action was discontinued, and a libel <i>in personam</i> filed, which is the present case. The respondents alleged that, owing to the neglect of the carrier, the coffee, black pepper, and cassia, were damaged to the amount of $4,720.60, which they claimed as a deduction from the freight. The whole freight claimed was $9,160.56, with interest from April, 1853.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court referred the case to a commissioner, who reported that the freight due in September, 1857, was $11,372.56, for which amount a decree was rendered, with costs.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case, being carried to the Circuit Court, was there tried on the appeal from the District Court and on additional evidence taken by the respondents. The decree of the District Court was affirmed with costs, and the respondents appealed to this court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was submitted on printed arguments by <i>Mr. Dodge</i> and <i>Mr. Johnson</i> for the appellants, and by <i>Mr. Donohue</i> for the appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The counsel for the appellants considered that the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States over an action on contract by a libel <i>in personam</i> in admiralty upon a contract of affreightment was still an open question, and therefore proceeded to argue it. The elaborate arguments against the jurisdiction filed by them, and for it by <i>Mr. Donohue</i>, are omitted by the reporter, in deference to the opinion of the court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice GRIER delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ship Gothland, owned by Enequist, the libellant, was chartered by Burt, Myrtle, &amp; Co., of Batavia, to proceed to Padung, on the island of Sumatra, there to receive a quantity of coffee; to return thence to Batavia and complete her cargo, and deliver the same in New York, freight to be paid by the assignees of the bills of lading on delivery of the cargo.
