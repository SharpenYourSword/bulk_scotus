It is the settled doctrine of this court, that in the location and survey of claims arising under acts of Congress like those of May, 1820, and March, 1823, the Executive Department of the Government has, in general, exclusive jurisdiction, and that all questions arising upon their location and survey are administrative in their nature, and must be disposed of in the Land Office.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff was aware of the existence of these claims, and of the jurisdiction to which their adjustment was confided.</p>\n<p>His patent contains an explicit reservation of the rights of any and all persons claiming under the act of Congress of 3d March, 1823, entitled \"An act to confirm certain claims to lots in the village of Peoria, in the State of Illinois.\" If he pretermitted his opposition to their location and survey before the General Land Office, he is concluded by his laches.

It is not at all clear that the amendments to the bill in which this claim is contained were filed with leave, and form any part of the bill. It is not charged in them that the plaintiffs in the suits at law have opposed any obstruction to his removal of the improvements, and the entire statement of the bill concerning them is vague and unsatisfactory.
