It is not necessary to follow this.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mackay was the holder of a grant of land from Spain for 30,000 arpents, prior to 1819. In that year he gave a bond, by way of mortgage, in which he promised to convey fourteen-thirtieths of the land to Delassus, who assigned his interest in it to Leduc. In 1822, Mackay died, leaving a widow and eight children. In 1836, Congress confirmed the claim to Mackay or his legal representatives. In 1842, Leduc died, devising all his property to Hypolite Papin. Afterwards, in the same year, Papin died, devising all his property to his children equally. In 1854, Joseph L. Papin, one of the children, and the defendant in error, foreclosed the mortgage against the heirs and administrators of Delassus. It was sold, and Papin became the purchaser of fourteen-thirtieths of the 30,000 arpents. Papin then claimed a partition, which was resisted by Massey and others, who claimed under the heirs of Mackay. The Supreme Court of Missouri decided in favor of Papin, and the case was brought up to this court, where it was argued by <i>Mr. Blair</i> for the plaintiffs in error, and <i>Mr. Glover</i> for the defendant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice CATRON delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is brought here by writ of error to the Supreme Court of Missouri.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1806, James Mackay presented his claim before the board of commissioners, sitting at St. Louis, to have confirmed to him 30,000 arpents of land.
