In 1805, (while it was a Congregatonal Church,) the Legislature of Massachusetts incorporated 'all persons who now are or who may hereafter be the proprietors of pews in the Congregational meeting-house situate on Federal street, Boston,' by the name of 'The Proprietors of the Meeting-house in Federal street, in the town of Boston,' and declared that the said corporation should be deemed seized of the meeting-house, with its appurtenances, &amp;c. The answer of the defendants sets forth, among other things, the act of incorporation, and avers that they were in possession long before the passage of that act; that they were in possession at the time of its passage, and have remained in possession ever since, as the undisputed owners of the premises. The State court dismissed the information, (3 Gray, 1,) and this writ of error was taken by the relators.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Bartlett</i>, of Massachusetts, for the defendants, moved the court to dismiss the writ of error for want of jurisdiction. The judgment (he said) is sought to be reversed, and the power of this court to do it rests solely on the ground that the act incorporating the defendants was unconstitutional, whereas it does not appear that the validity of that act was in any manner drawn into controversy. Even if the validity of the act had been a question in the court below, and its validity had been sustained, there are various other grounds within the exclusive cognizance of the State court upon which this judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctrine is now firmly established, that to give this court jurisdiction, it must appear by the record, or by clear and necessary intendment, that the question on which the jurisdiction is founded <i>must</i> have been raised, and <i>must</i> have been decided, in order to have induced the judgment. <i>Crowell</i> vs. <i>Randall</i>, (10 Peters, 368, 398.)

It must appear either on the bill or answer, or decree of the court. <i>Mich. Cent. R. R.</i> vs. <i>Mich. South. R. R.</i>, (19 How., 379.) In this case the <i>bill</i> refers to the act of 1795 but once, and there avers in substance that it is valid.

The <i>decree</i> simply orders the bill to be dismissed.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Cushing</i>, of Massachusetts. The act of 1805 purports to transfer the seisin of the lands in dispute to the corporation, and thus impairs the obligation of the trust contract by which the premises were devoted to the religious uses of the Scottish Presbyterian Church.

The issue, then, was not on the validity of the act, but on the construction of the original deed or agreement of the parties who built the meeting-house.
