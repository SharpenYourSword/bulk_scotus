The Kentucky was seized on the 27th of May, and on the same day a bond for her release was executed by the defendants, as sureties for the claimant of the Kentucky, which bond was duly approved and the Kentucky was discharged. A recovery was had by plaintiff, and a decree perfected in his favor in May, 1859, for $21,581 28 against the claimant of the Kentucky, and Fitzhugh, Littlejohn, and Miller, his sureties. In July, 1859, execution issued commanding the marshal of the district to make the amount of the decree out of the goods and chattels of the defendants, and failing in this, to arrest and keep them until the moneys were paid. Under this process the defendants were imprisoned, but were discharged after a hearing upon <i>habeas corpus</i> by the Circuit Court of the United States for the northern district of New York, on the ground that as the law of the State had abolished imprisonment for debt on contracts, the defendants could not be imprisoned under the acts of Congress of 28th February, 1839, and 14th June, 1841. This writ of error was then taken by Pratt, the plaintiff below, and the question argued in this court was, whether, under the acts of Congress, the defendants were liable to imprisonment.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon this question the arguments were elaborate and full, but they are not given here because nothing was decided by this court except the question of jurisdiction.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Rogers</i>, of New York, for plaintiff in error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Grant</i>, of New York, for defendants in error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice NELSON.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pratt, the plaintiff in error, obtained a decree in admiralty against the propeller Kentucky for a collision on Lake Erie.
