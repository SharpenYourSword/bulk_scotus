It was a bill in equity, filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, by Jesse Hoyt, the plaintiff in error, against Abraham G. Thompson, George B. Fisk, the Long Island Railroad Company, and the Statutory Representatives of the State of Michigan. All the defendants except the representatives of the State of Michigan demurred. The demurrers were argued before one of the judges of the Supreme Court, who overruled them. From this decision the defendants appealed to the general term of the Supreme Court, when, under a State statute the case was transferred to the Superior Court of the city of New York, where the appeal was argued, and the decision of the Supreme Court overruled, the demurrers allowed, and the bill dismissed. From this decision the plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals, where the judgment of the Superior Court was reversed, and the demurrers overruled, but defendants had leave to answer. About this time the defendant, Abraham G. Thompson, died, and Henry Shelden was qualified as his executor, and was made a party defendant. The Superior Court, on receiving the <i>remittitur</i> from the Court of Appeals, rendered judgment for the plaintiff on the demurrers, and ordered the defendants demurring to answer to the bill. Shelden and the Long Island Railroad Company filed their answers. Testimony was taken, and the court made a decree for plaintiff. Shelden appealed from this decree of a single judge at a special term, to the general term of the Superior Court, and obtained a reversal of it, with an order for a new trial. From the decision of the general term the plaintiff Hoyt took the cause to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court, made it final against plaintiff, as he had stipulated that it should be, and remitted the record and proceedings to the Superior Court. The Superior Court, on filing the <i>remittitur</i> from the Court of Appeals, ordered that final judgment be rendered against the plaintiff, and that his bill be dismissed. Thereupon plaintiff sued out a writ of error from the Supreme Court of the nited States to the Superior Court, in which he made Shelden, as executor of Thompson, and the Long Island Ralroad Company, defendants in error. Pending this writ of error Shelden died, and Edward G. Thompson, as his successor, and as administrator with the will annexed of Abraham G. Thompson, was made a party by order of this court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The power and jurisdiction of this court to review the proceedings of the State court was denied by the defendant's counsel.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the part of the plaintiff in error, it was contended that by a certain act of the New Jersey Legislature, and by the record of a judicial proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the same State, the title to the property in dispute was vested in the persons under and through whom he claimed it, and that the State court of New York in deciding against him, and dismissing his bill, refused to give full faith and credit to the records and judicial proceedings of the State of New Jersey, as required by Art. IV, Sec. 1, of the Federal Constitution. The right which he had under the Constitution being refused him in the State court, his remedy was to reverse the proceeding on a writ of error from this court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' answer to this was, that no such question had been raised in the State court. No claim of any right under the Federal Constitution was asserted, nor was the attention of the court called to it in any manner whatever. It is not enough that such a point <i>might have been</i> made.

The rule upon this subject is clearly and fully stated in 18 How., 515, <i>Maxwell</i> vs. <i>Newbold and others</i>, as well as in many other cases to which it is unnecessary to refer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This provision of the Constitution is not referred to in the plaintiff's bill of complaint in the State court, nor in any of the proceedings there had.

But all of the matters put in issue by the bill and answers, and decided by the State court, were questions which depended for their decision upon principles of law and equity, as recognised and administered in the State of New York, and without reference to the construction or effect of any provision in the Constitution, or any act of Congress. This court has no appellate power over the judgment of a State court pronounced in such a controversy, and this writ of error must, therefore, be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "", "html_with_citations": "<p class=\"case_cite\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></span></p>\n    <p class=\"case_cite\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Black</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></span></p>\n    <p class=\"case_cite\">17 L.Ed. 65</p>\n    <p class=\"parties\">HOYT<br>v.<br>SHELDEN, EX'R OF THOMPSON, AND THE LONG ISLAND<br>RAILROAD COMPANY.</p>\n    <p class=\"date\">December Term, 1861</p>\n    <div class=\"prelims\">\n      <p class=\"indent\">In error to the Superior Court of the city of New York.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was a writ of error to the Superior Court of the city of New York, 'being possessed of the record and proceedings upon a <i>remittitur</i> from the Court of Appeals of the State of New York.'
