The Potomac was a ship of more than five hundred tons, and was engaged in the general freighting business. She had just returned from a foreign voyage and was about to sail for Australia. The libel stated that the repairs were necessary and that without them she could not proceed to sea and earn freight and passage-money; that they were furnished on the credit of the vessel, and master and owners (the master was an owner); that the libellant had a lien upon her for them, and that the case was within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The answer admitted the repairing the vessel, but not to the amount claimed, and did not deny the jurisdiction, the necessity for the repairs or the lien.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court made a decree that the libellant recover the amount of his repairs, and referred it to a Commissioner to ascertain the amount. The Commissioner reported $3,996.18, including the interest. The claimant excepted to the report.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court overruled the exceptions, and made a final decree that the libellant recover the amount reported by the Commissioner.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claimant appealed to the Circuit Court from the whole of the final decree.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The libellants moved the Circuit Court to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it had not been perfected. The motion was denied, on condition that the claimants deposit the amount of the decree in Court, which was done, and by order of the Court it was paid over to the libellants, on their giving a bond to obey the order of Court in the cause.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much conflicting evidence was given upon the trial, the libellant proving his demand for work and materials from the books and accounts kept by his clerks in the ordinary course of business, while the claimant brought persons, said to be skilled in the business of building and repairing ships, to show that the amount expended upon the vessel, fell far short of that claimed by the libellant. The Circuit Court affirmed the decree of the District Court and the claimant took this appeal.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Gillet</i>, of Washington City, for Appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Benedict</i>, of New York, <i>contra</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice GRIER.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the counsel prepared their briefs of argument in this case, they could not have seen the report of the case of 'the Steamer St. Lawrence,' (1 Black, 525), or they would have considered it labor lost to argue the same question of jurisdiction on the very same facts again at this term. The opinion of the Court in that case was unanimous; the question was fully discussed and the opinion delivered by the Chief Justice, and needs no further remark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appella t, in his answer, admits that the repairs were made to his ship by the libellant, but takes issue on the amount and alleges an agreement that the repairs to be made should not exceed a certain sum, less by one-half than the bill finally presented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But it appeared clearly from the evidence, that although the libellant made an estimate of what would be the probable cost of the repairs, he did not contract to do the work for any given sum. The contract was to supply the timber and materials at market prices, and to receive certain wages per diem for each person employed. When the vessel was stripped, it was found necessary to make repairs on a much larger scale than had been at first estimated. The amount of libellant's bill of course far exceeded his original estimate. The report of the Master found the amount due, but stated no account. The exceptions to it were&#8212;1st. 'That it was for an amount far exceeding any amount of work performed.' 2d. 'That the libellant had not proved any work performed for which he was entitled to a decree.' 3d. 'That the libellant was not, under the pleadings, entitled to any decree whatever in his favor.' 4th.
