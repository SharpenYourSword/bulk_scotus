Hazard, a married woman,&#8212;who had purchased on the credit of her separate estate. O. E. P. Hazard, her husband, and Sam'l Chilton, her trustee, were joined with her as defendants.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bill sets forth the sale of the property to Agnes R. Hazard&#8212;as shown by the recitals of the deed&#8212;the conveyance to Chilton, as trustee for her&#8212;and avers that the purchase money is due and unpaid. Mrs. Hazard filed her answer, admitting the sale and conveyance, but denying that 'the sum of $6,000 remains due and unpaid,' and 'she shows to the Court that she fully satisfied the said Elizabeth in her life time with the said purchase money, and, in proof thereof, she exhibits with her answer, and will prove it when it shall be necessary to do so, the receipt of the said Elizabeth to her, bearing date the 12th day of September, 1856, whereby she acknowledged the payment to her, said Elizabeth, of the sum of five thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars in full of respondent's purchase of house and lot of her, sold on the 21st March, 1856,'&#8212;she cannot state when, where, or how, the said purchase money was paid and satisfied to said Elizabeth Braiden,'&#8212;'she cannot state positively, of her own knowledge, that any sums of money were paid to her,' and contends 'that it is not material whether or not the whole amount of the sum of $6,000 was paid said Elizabeth, if she voluntarily gave a receipt in full.' In this answer she relies on the <i>receipt</i> entirely, not stating any specific amount as having been paid. She denied the allegation of the bill, that her separate estate had no real existence, but failed to answer the interrogatories propounded mainly for the purpose of showing that she could not have paid for the property from her separate estate. Exceptions being filed, the Court required her to answer the interrogatories. In her amended answer, she says some payments were made, but she does not know how much, 'the whole matter being conducted by her husband, who held her separate estate.' She again set up the <i>receipt</i> as an absolute defense. In answer to interrogatories she declared that she did not know how much was paid by her husband. The husband also answered, and so did the trustee. The plaintiff filed the general replication. The cause was set for hearing. The controversy was, whether or not the purchase money had been satisfied and discharged, which necessarily involved the genuineness of the receipt.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court directed issues to be made up and tried before a jury on the law side of the Court. A jury was duly impanneled, and found for the plaintiff <i>that the receipt set up was not the genuine receipt of Elizabeth Braiden</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cause coming on for final hearing, the Court passed a decree that all the purchase money was due and ordered a sale of the property for the payment of it. The case came before this Court on an appeal from that decree.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Carlisle</i>, of Washington City, for Appellants.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Stone</i>, and <i>Mr. Bradley</i>, of Washington City, for Appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice GRIER.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When one person has got the estate of another, he ought not, in conscience, to be allowed to keep it without paying the consideration.
