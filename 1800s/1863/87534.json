Campbell brought his action against Nebraska City in the Court of the Second Judicial District for Otoe County, and alleged in his petition that the defendant, being a municipal corporation, had, by its charter, the title and control of the streets, alleys, squares, wharves, and other highways and public grounds within its limits, and was bound to keep them in repair. That the defendant was so bound to keep in repair a certain bridge on South street, across Tabb Creek; but, contrary to its legal duty, left that bridge without side-railing, and in other respects unsafe and defective, by reason of which, the plaintiff, a physician, visiting his patients, in a buggy, was thrown from the bridge and greatly injured, so as to prevent him for a long time from practising his profession.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City denied its legal liability for such damages under any circumstances, and averred that the plaintiff got his injuries by his own fault; for he was thrown over the bridge in consequence of the viciousness of his horse, which he was carelessly driving without a whip, and which had taken fright at a paper posted on the bridge by a third party.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $3,000 damages, and after an unsuccessful motion by the defendant in arrest of judgment, the Court gave judgment on the verdict. The cause was taken, by the petition of the defendant, to the Supreme Court of the Territory, where the judgment was affirmed, and thence it came to this Court by writ of error sued out by the City.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Taylor</i>, of Nebraska, for Plaintiff in Error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Woolworth</i>, of Nebraska, <i>contra</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice NELSON.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the Territory of Nebraska.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suit was brought in the Court below by Campbell against the City to recover damages for injuries received by reason of a defective bridge in one of the streets in the City.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The charter vested in the City Council the title to all the streets within the corporate limits, and it is made their duty to construct and improve the same at the public's expense; for this purpose, and others, the counsel are authorized to levy a tax on all the taxable property within the City.
