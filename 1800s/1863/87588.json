The plaintiff below, the defendant in error in this court, alleges in his complaint a seizin in fee and a right to the possession of the entire premises. The proof established and the jury found that he was only seized of an undivided twentieth interest; but the court held that, as the defendants had shown no title, he was entitled to the possession of the entire premises, \"in subordination,\" however, \"to the rights of his co-tenants,\" and directed judgment to be entered in his favor as against the defendants for the same.

Under the allegation of seizin in the complaint, it was sufficient, as determined by repeated adjudications of the Supreme Court of the State, for the plaintiff to establish any interest in the premises which gave him a right of possession. The action of ejectment determines no rights but those of present possession; and that one tenant in common has such rights as against all parties but his co-tenants, or persons holding under them, is not questioned.<sup>[\u00a7]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*374</span> On the trial the defendants produced a conveyance of the interest in the premises of some of the co-tenants of the plaintiff, executed after issue joined.

But the court, in directing the judgment to be entered upon the special verdict, held the evidence inadmissible, and excluded the finding.

By a statute of the State the different forms of action known to the common law are abolished. The plaintiff is required to state in his complaint the facts constituting his cause of action in ordinary and concise language, with a prayer for the relief to which he may deem himself entitled.

Johnson, in his complaint, as a declaration is there called, alleged a seizin in fee and a right to the possession of the entire demanded premises. The jury, however, by special verdict, found that the plaintiff was seized of a fractional part only; to wit, of an undivided twentieth interest. The defendants showed no title in any part; and the court gave judgment in Johnson's favor for the <i>entire</i> premises, '<i>in subordination to the rights of his co-tenants</i>.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the trial the defendants offered in evidence a deed, conveying the interest of some of the co-tenants, executed after issue joined; an issue amounting in fact to the general issue. The deed was admitted (the question of its admissibility under the pleadings being reserved), and the jury based one of its findings upon it. The court, however, finally held the evidence not competent, and, in entering judgment on the verdict, excluded the finding made upon its basis.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The questions in this court were:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Whether judgment could properly be given, as it was in favor of the plaintiff for the entire premises, in subordination to the rights of his co-tenants?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Whether the deed was rightly excluded?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Train, for the plaintiffs in error</i>, relied, as respected the first point, on the familiar principles that the plaintiff must recover, if at all, on the strength of his own title, and not on the weakness of the defendant's; and that a recovery must be had <i>secundum allegata</i>, or not at all: arguing, from the last position, that even though the special verdict found the plaintiff entitled to an undivided twentieth, he could not have judgment therefor, except by amending the declaration or complaint. On the second point, he contended that the title of the defendants acquired after issue was admissible; citing <i>Stockdale</i> v. <i>Young</i>, a decision in South Carolina,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> in which it was held that, 'in trespass to try title, the acquisition of title by defendant, since the last continuance, could not operate to prevent the recovery of damages to which the plaintiff might be entitled, and therefore that it was unnecessary to plead it <i>puis darrein continuance;</i> but that it might be given in evidence under the general issue.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Messrs. Hepburn and Hill, contra</i>, relied, for the first point, on <i>Stark</i> v. <i>Barrett;</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and, for the second, on <i>Yount</i> v. <i>Howell</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> California decisions, both.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice FIELD delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an action of ejectment for the possession of certain real property, situated in the city of Oakland, in the State of California.
