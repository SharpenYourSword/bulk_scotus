On writ of error taken by Gregg, this court reversed that judgment and remitted the case with directions to issue a <i>venire de novo</i>. Between the time, however, that the Circuit Court gave its judgment of recovery, and that when this court gave <i>its</i> of reversal, Forsyth had been put in possession of the premises by a <i>habere facias</i>, and had collected, moreover, the costs of the suit.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As soon as the mandate of this court reversing the judgment was sent down to the court below, but before it had been filed or a rule entered in pursuance of its directions, Gregg moved the court for a writ of restitution. This motion the court refused to grant.
