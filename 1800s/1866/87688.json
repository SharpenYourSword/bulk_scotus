The court being satisfied that the value of the land was not sufficient to require stamps of greater amount than were actually attached admitted the deed; and final judgment having gone in favor of Lewis, the other party, Campau, brought the case here on error as being within the 25th section of the Judiciary Act of 1789; a section which enacts that a final judgment or decree in any suit in the highest court of law or equity in a State wherein is drawn in question the <i>validity</i> of a statute of the United States and the decision is against its validity; or where is drawn in question the <i>construction</i> of any clause of a statute of the United States and the decision is against the title, right, or privilege specially set up or claimed by either party&#8212;may be re-examined here</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Walker</i> now moved to dismiss the cause, on the ground of want of jurisdiction, <i>Mr. Bishop opposing</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The CHIEF JUSTICE:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the validity of the statute, nor its construction was in any way drawn in question.
