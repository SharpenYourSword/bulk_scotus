The nominal destination of the vessel and cargo was Cardenas; but the preparatory proofs clearly established that this pretended destination was false, and that the entire lading was to be there transshipped, to be conveyed by a swifter vessel, or was to be carried on without transshipment to its belligerent destination, at the discretion of the rebel agent, whose instructions the master was directed to receive and obey on arrival at Cardenas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Coffey, for the captors; no one appearing, nor any argument being submitted for the claimants</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The CHIEF JUSTICE:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case in its principal features resembles that of the Bermuda and her cargo; they are, perhaps, even more irreconcilable with neutral good faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is enough to say that neutrals who place their vessels under belligerent control, and engage them in belligerent trade, or permit them to be sent with contraband cargoes under cover of false destination to neutral ports, while the real destination is to belligerent ports, impress upon them the character of the belligerent in whose service they are employed, and cannot complain if they are seized and condemned as enemy property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principles recognized in the preceding case require the affirmance of the decree of the District Court; and it is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED ACCORDINGLY.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>70 U.S. 559 (____)</b></center>\n<center><b>3 Wall. 559</b></center>\n<center><h1>THE HART.</h1></center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center></center>\n<p>Mr. Coffey, for the captors; no one appearing, nor any argument being submitted for the claimants.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*560</span> The CHIEF JUSTICE:</p>\n<p>The case in its principal features resembles that of the Bermuda and her cargo; they are, perhaps, even more irreconcilable with neutral good faith.</p>\n<p>It is enough to say that neutrals who place their vessels under belligerent control, and engage them in belligerent trade, or permit them to be sent with contraband cargoes under cover of false destination to neutral ports, while the real destination is to belligerent ports, impress upon them the character of the belligerent in whose service they are employed, and cannot complain if they are seized and condemned as enemy property.</p>\n<p>The principles recognized in the preceding case require the affirmance of the decree of the District Court; and it is</p>\n<p>AFFIRMED ACCORDINGLY.</p>\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "<div>\n<center><b><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></span> (____)</b></center>\n<center><b><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></span></b></center>\n<center><h1>THE HART.</h1></center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center></center>\n<p>Mr. Coffey, for the captors; no one appearing, nor any argument being submitted for the claimants.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*560</span> The CHIEF JUSTICE:</p>\n<p>The case in its principal features resembles that of the Bermuda and her cargo; they are, perhaps, even more irreconcilable with neutral good faith.</p>\n<p>It is enough to say that neutrals who place their vessels under belligerent control, and engage them in belligerent trade, or permit them to be sent with contraband cargoes under cover of false destination to neutral ports, while the real destination is to belligerent ports, impress upon them the character of the belligerent in whose service they are employed, and cannot complain if they are seized and condemned as enemy property.</p>\n<p>The principles recognized in the preceding case require the affirmance of the decree of the District Court; and it is</p>\n<p>AFFIRMED ACCORDINGLY.</p>\n</div>", "id": 87733, "judges": "", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/87733/", "sha1": "0d6091f6cdd8ad732ed1171eec9a6653ebfff822", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:01:22"}
