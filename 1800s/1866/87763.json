Suit having been brought on this bond against Dashiel, and Paschall, one of the sureties, to recover what the United States alleged was due, to wit, $20,085, a defence was set up to part of the claim; and the defence being sustained by the court below, the United States had verdict and judgment for but $10,318.22. Error was taken to that judgment, and the judgment reversed. The case next preceding gives report of the matter.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present suit was brought on the same official bond of Dashiel, against the personal representatives of Allsbury, another of the sureties. The case came on for trial after the trial, verdict, and judgment, just mentioned, against the principal, and Paschall, the other surety, for $10,318.22.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment was pleaded <i>puis darrein continuance</i>, in this suit, for the purpose of reducing the recovery to that amount.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was admitted by the court, and instructions given accordingly, and the jury found a verdict for the above sum.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The correctness of what was thus done was the question now here.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Stanbery, A.
