The articles are not round, hewed, or <i>sawed</i>, but <i>split</i> timber; and they are also manufactured articles, having been made by hand, and with a special design or purpose, into the shape and form in which they were imported. The process of splitting, though requiring the most common labor, is, we contend, a process of manufacture. The splitting has reduced round or hewed timber into articles of commerce, ready and fit for immediate conversion, by machinery and the employment of a higher art, into other articles of manufacture and commerce. They were not split and sold as mere lumber capable of being used for any purpose whatever; but they were split and sold for the particular use for which they were imported by the defendant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Literally, anything to which the handiwork of man has been applied becomes <i>manufactured</i>. The older dictionaries confine the meaning of the word entirely to this conversion or character given by touch of hand. The word etymologically means made by hand; but we now largely give it also the sense of being made by machinery.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Mr. Newberry, contra:</i>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most convenient form for removal from the forests and for transportation, into which oak and other straight-grained hard-wood timber can be reduced, is that of the rough-split pipe and hogshead stave, so called, and such form is also best adapted for the preservation of wood in seasoning, &amp;c.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To reduce the timber into such form does not require skilled labor of the mechanic, but requires only the most common unskilled labor.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Timber split in this form, though called 'rough-split pipe and hogshead staves,' is not wholly or <i>mainly</i> used for the manufacture of hogsheads, pipes, or other casks, but is used in the manufacture of many articles manufactured wholly or in part of wood, and used also, extensively, as tonnage and in the storage of cargoes of ships and vessels.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By coopers, such timber is known as 'coopers' timber,' and is considered and treated as raw material.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the light of these facts this timber must be held to be unmanufactured, raw material, as much so as any sawed lumber. The fact that timber thus split is commonly <i>called</i> by a name which would seem to indicate a manufactured article is of no consequence whatever. Lumber sawed into particular forms takes such names as, for example, 'flooring,' 'siding,' 'deck plank,' 'lath,' &amp;c., &amp;c. Yet such lumber is not held to be manufactured. Staves are but a species of lumber. Webster, in his dictionary, defines 'lumber' to be 'timber sawed or split for use, as bearers, joyce, boards, planks, <i>staves</i>, and the like.' The labor necessary to be expended to reduce the timber to the form of sawed lumber is evidently greater and more skilled than that necessary to reduce it to the form of rough-split pipe or hogshead staves, so called. What reason, then, could have operated to induce a discrimination in the treaty in favor of the former?

The regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury declared, that articles of wood entered under the designations of the treaty remained liable to the duty, if manufactured, in whole or in part, by planing, shaving, turning, splitting, or riving, or any process of manufacture, other than rough-hewing or sawing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s\" id=\"fn-s-s_ref\">**</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think this a sound construction of the words of the clause.

It has been already reduced to the proper form and size&#8212;a work which, in the first stages of the manufacture of the hogshead, must be done, and by which a considerable advance is made in fitting and finishing it for the market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As this treaty has been annulled, the question is no longer of any general importance; and as we concur in the interpretation given to it by the Secretary of the Treasury, it is unnecessary to extend this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court answer the question</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IN THE AFFIRMATIVE.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>NOTE.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time with the preceding case was disposed of another, coming, like it, from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Michigan, on a division of opinion of the judges.
