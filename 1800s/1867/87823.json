T. Soutter, survivor, &amp;c., against the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company and the Milwaukee and Minnesota Railroad Company, on the 5th March, 1867, for $40,000, and ordered a sale of the road mortgaged to secure the debt, the last-mentioned company prayed an appeal to this court, which was allowed. For the purpose of staying proceedings on the decree, they offered a bond, in the penalty of $50,000, within the ten days allowed for that purpose, which the district judge declined to approve, but upon which he made the following indorsement:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'March 16, 1867.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The counsel of complainant having objected to the allowance of this bond for <i>supersedeas</i>, on the ground that all the sureties are <i>non-residents of the district, for this reason this bond is not approved for a supersedeas</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'A. G. MILLER, District Judge.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record of the case having been brought into this court on the appeal taken, the appellants now petitioned the court for a <i>mandamus</i> to compel the district judge to approve the bond and allow a <i>supersedeas</i>, or for such other relief in the premises as this court could give.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Messrs.

If we had the right to do this, which is extremely doubtful, it is unnecessary, as the remedy which is in our own hands is ample. The case being properly in this court by appeal, we have, by the fourteenth section of the Judiciary Act, a right to issue any writ which may be necessary to render our appellate jurisdiction effectual.
