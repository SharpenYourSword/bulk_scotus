Some remark being made by the court as to the circumstance that the United States were on the side of the captors while the Treasury Department appeared in an antagonistic position, and a doubt being expressed whether it was quite allowable that the Treasury should thus appear, <i>Mr. Cushing</i> referred the matter of his taking part to the pleasure of the court; observing only that he was prepared to speak in support of the act of the Secretary of the Treasury, if desired.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the case came to be finally argued in conclusion&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the court on this point:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court has considered the question whether counsel shall be heard in this cause on behalf of the Treasury Department, and has instructed me to say that in causes where the United States is a party, and is represented by the Attorney-General or the Assistant Attorney-General, or special counsel employed by the Attorney-General, no counsel can be heard in opposition on behalf of any other of the departments of the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, however, the argument has doubtless proceeded under the impression at the bar that counsel would be heard on behalf of the Treasury Department, and the court is desirous of all the light that can be derived from the fullest discussion.
