From these, the charter-party on board, and a survey of the vessel, it appeared that the vessel had been sold 24th April, 1863, by certain persons, British subjects, who had bought her a week before, to Corry &amp; Laycock; that the vessel (one of 1500 tons burden) had been built in 1855 as a war vessel for the Portuguese government, and at the time of the sale had been employed in the British transport service; that her marine engines were six feet below the water line; that three days after the sale, <i>i. e.</i>, on the 27th April, the new purchasers chartered her to Duranty &amp; Co., 'for the conveyance of lawful merchandise between Liverpool and Mexico and any other lawful ports; <i>the vessel not to attempt to break any blockade. No injurious cargoes to be shipped</i> as ordered by the charterers;' that Henry &amp; Co. had shipped upon her a general cargo; gambier, sumac, boots in cases, bar, wrought, and hoop iron, baled goods, and a number of axes; that the vessel began to unlade and relade at the same time. When captured she had on board her a keg (25 lbs.) and a flask of gunpowder, 72 cannon cartridges, 48 rifle cartridges, 24 blue lights, 16 rockets, 47 muskets ready for action, 4 boarding pistols, 11 tomahawks for boarding, 46 boarding cutlasses, and several other military accoutrements placed in the companion-way or in a room amidships; also among the dunnage, partly hidden, a lot of solid round shot, and a quantity of grape-shot loose, and between decks two casks of iron rings used for artillery harness. These articles, it was testified by one or more of the persons above mentioned, had been on the ship when in the transport service, and had followed her as she passed to the new owners. The captain testified that there was 'no other warlike material aboard; that when the vessel was loaded at Liverpool everything like contraband had been excluded; and that Corry &amp; Laycock owned the ship, and Henry &amp; Co. the cargo; that all the owners were Englishmen, and had always lived at home; that the voyage was from Liverpool to Matamoras and back; that the outward cargo was to be delivered to Milmo &amp; Co., a firm of Matamoras, for the benefit of Henry &amp; Co.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appeared also, from the testimonies just mentioned, that the vessel cleared from Liverpool direct to Matamoras, but had stopped, as the mate testified (the captain saying nothing about this), at Jamaica to take in coal; and that she arrived at the mouth of the Rio Grande, the dividing river between Mexico and the United States, June 24, 1863, and anchored well on the Mexican side; that she began to unlade her outward cargo and to take a return cargo cotton at the same time; the outward cargo being discharged in lighters and taken by steam from thence to Matamoras, about thirty miles from the mouth of the river; the return cargo of cotton being brought down in lighters and so put on the Sir William Peel; and that, about 950 bales being on board, the vessel was captured. That the ship's papers had been given to her consignees at Matamoras, and were therefore not on board, the vessel not being yet fully laden or ready to return.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to this testimony of the captain, mate, and seaman, the testimony of two other persons, loyal citizens of the United States, one resident in Brownsville, a place in the State of Texas, and then in possession of the Confederacy; the other a mate of a merchant vessel of New York, then at anchor near the Peel, was taken, <i>in preparatorio</i>, along with that of the witnesses from the ship. The testimony of these witnesses went to prove that the rebel authorities or rebel citizens were interested in the vessel and the cargo both outward and return.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the case coming to hearing, the court, on motion of counsel of the captors, excluded the testimony of such of the witnesses as were not found on board the captured vessel, but subsequently gave leave to both parties to take further proofs. Further testimony, including that of one of the persons whose evidence had been excluded, as taken <i>in preparatorio</i>, was accordingly taken on both sides. It was contradictory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the one hand it was testified that the consignees, Milmo &amp; Co., of Matamoras, had the general reputation of being agents of the Rebel Confederacy, that they had a branch house in Brownsville, nearly opposite, in Texas, and were engaged in receiving cargoes from Europe which they disposed of to the military authorities of the Confederacy, receiving and lading, in return, cotton which the Confederacy had seized, and over which it exercised the right of property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">One witness of the captors said:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'I crossed over (from Texas to Mexico) between five and six hundred bales, Confederate cotton, that was to go on to the Sir W. Peel, but I cannot swear that it went on board her.' . . . 'This cotton had been turned over by a Confederate States agent to Milmo &amp; Co., for account of the Confederate government. . . . Milmo &amp; Co. hurried me up, as they were anxious to ship it on the Sir W. Peel.' 'I shipped the cotton even during nights and on Sundays.' 'I was fully confident at the time that this cotton was shipped for the Peel, and had no doubt of it whatever.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another witness of the captors, resident for many years in Brownsville and its vicinity, testified:'It was generally known in Matamoras that the Peel was at the mouth of the Rio Grande. This public notoriety was as to her size; second, as to the cargo she had; and third, as to the disposition to be made of that vessel after having the port of Matamoras. Her size was unusual for a vessel in those waters; her cargo, comprising arms and munitions of war. It was the general rumor that she was to receive her cargo of cotton, go to Havana and Nassau, and there discharge her cargo, and then become a privateer. I very often met with Texan and rebel officers. I remember two with whom I had conversations with regard to the Peel. The adjutant, Dr. Riley, at the time of the seizure of cotton by the Confederacy, told me, when I inquired of him the cause of this impressment of cotton, that certain vessels had arrived from England belonging to parties with whom he had contracts, and they found it necessary to impress cotton if they were to receive these cargoes; accordingly the cotton was impressed, in order that they could receive these cargoes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The Sir William Peel was spoken of in connection with these cargoes in a conversation with J. K. Spear, quartermaster's clerk in Brownsville, in reference to the amount of arms the people of Western Texas had. He stated that they received all the arms they desired from vessels at the mouth of the Rio Grande, and that for a week previous he had been engaged in crossing arms for the quartermaster. I inquired of him where he had the arms from, whether from the Mexican shore or direct from the Gulf. He answered he got them in both ways, direct from vessels and from the other side, the Mexican shore. At the same time he stated that a particular friend of his was interested in the Sir William Peel, and that he had been receiving goods from the Sir William Peel.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, the testimony of one of the partners of the firm of Milmo &amp; Co. was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The vessel belonged and still belongs to Messrs. Corry &amp; Laycock, merchants, living in Manchester, England, and British subjects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The cargo on board the vessel when captured, was and is the <i>bona fide</i> property of Henry &amp; Co., residing in Manchester, British subjects, purchased by us in this port for them; the cargo landed here belonged to the same parties. I derive this knowledge from the consignment, and <i>correspondence</i> relative to the consignment of the said cargo to us, by the said Henry &amp; Co. Their ownership was absolute and exclusive of all other interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'We had full instructions to invest the entire proceeds of the inward cargo in cotton, and to fill up the Sir William Peel for Liverpool. If the proceeds did not furnish cotton enough, then to take any freight offering for that port, sufficient to load the vessel at the ruling rate of freight. We accordingly had ready for the Sir William Peel, three thousand bales of cotton, the quantity thought to be necessary to fill her. Our instructions also directed us to give her as quick despatch as possible for Liverpool; and her cargo was engaged for, and the nine hundred and four bales on board were destined for that port.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instructions referred to by this witness were not produced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The further proofs showed that there was machinery aboard, apparently not on the manifest, which had been landed; bales of blankets, &amp;c., &amp;c., and also tended to show that the vessel when first anchored, was in American water; but that she had shifted her position to the spot at which she was captured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testimony as a whole, satisfied the mind of the court below that the vessel was captured when anchored south of the line dividing the waters of the Rio Grande, and when, therefore, she was in neutral waters. On that ground, it decreed her restitution; but entertaining grave doubts as to the object of her voyage, 'so grave, indeed, that but for this consideration that she was captured in neutral waters, the court should have decreed her condemnation, it ordered that the costs and charges consequent upon the capture, be paid by the claimants, and that damages be refused.' Both parties appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Messrs. Evarts and Marvin, with whom was Mr. A. F. Smith, for the claimants:</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I. The order made in the court below, granting to the captors time to procure further evidence, was improper; the captors not being entitled, under the circumstances of the case, to any such order; and, particularly, not entitled to an order granting them leave to produce further proof in the case generally, without specifying any particular matter or point to which the further proof should be directed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence to acquit or condemn, with or without costs or damages, must, in the first instance, come merely from the ship taken, viz., the papers on board, and the examination, on oath, of the master and other principal officers. If there do not appear from thence ground to condemn as enemy's property, or contraband goods going to the enemy, there must be an acquittal, unless from the aforesaid evidence the property shall appear so doubtful that it is reasonable to go into further proof. The claimant is often allowed to supply further proof of his neutral ownership. The captor is rarely allowed to produce other proof than what is furnished by the ship's papers, and the testimony of persons on board; and when he is allowed to produce further proof, the order should confine such proof to a particular point or matter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assert, therefore, that the cause shall be heard and decided in this court, as it ought to have been in the court below, upon the claim itself, upon the papers found on board the vessel, and the depositions of the master and persons on board the vessel at the time of the capture; that is to pay, in this case, of the master, the mate, one seaman, and none others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On these testimonies it is impossible to find justification even of seizure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. (<i>Mr. Evarts</i>.)&#8212;1. The claimants in this case are <i>neutrals</i>, subjects of Great Britain, and as such have a <i>persona standi</i> in the prize court to allege, according to the regular procedure of the prize jurisdiction, whatever is pertinent and significant on the question 'of lawful prize of war,' under the law of nations, as bearing upon the sentence of restitution or condemnation to be passed in the cause. Whenever, therefore, upon the contestation of these competent litigants, any fact appears to the court exhibiting the capture to be unlawful and void, that fact is to have its consequence in a sentence of restitution, as necessarily as upon any other form of presentation to or cognizance by the court of the fact in question. It is impossible for the court to <i>ignore</i> such fact, for it is alleged and proved by a litigant, to whom it is open to allege and prove whatever is pertinent and is true, bearing upon the question of prize or no prize. If the fact thus before the court, under the rules of the law of nations, requires the restitution of the prize, sentence of condemnation cannot pass without a violation of the law of nations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Sir William Peel with her cargo, when lying at anchor within the neutral territory of Mexico, was captured, in violation of the <i>absolute</i> immunity from belligerent visitation, search, or capture, enjoyed by neutral property within neutral territory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon this fact appearing, the capture is, by the law of nations, illegal and void, carrying no rights to the captors, involving the neutral property or its neutral owners in no amenability to the prize jurisdiction on the merits, and exposing the captors to exemplary damages from the justice of the prize court, and to personal punishment from their belligerent government, which their misconduct has compromised with the neutral nation of the injured neutral owners, not less than with the neutral nation whose territory has been violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As between belligerents, the rights of war are substantially measured by their power. But as between neutrals, the mere power of the belligerents carries no right whatever. The whole scope and measure of the rights of a belligerent towards neutrals, are determined by the conceded or adjusted rules and limits of interference fixed by the law of nations. These rules and limits relate either to the theatre or region within which <i>any rights whatever</i> are conceded to the belligerents towards neutrals, or to the restrictions upon such rights <i>within the theatre or region where, to any degree</i>, such rights are conceded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the law of nations, within the region invaded by this belligerent capture, <i>the belligerent had no right whatever</i> as towards or against neutral nations, nor the property of their subjects. 'The rights of war,' says Mr. Wheaton, 'can be exercised only within the territory of the belligerent powers, <i>upon the high seas</i>, or in a territory belonging to no one.

The case of <i>The Lilla</i> (in Sprague's Decisions),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> in the District Court of Massachusetts, is no exception to this proposition.

In other words, that in the case of enemy's property, the fact of invalid capture cannot come before the prize court, except upon the representation of the neutral nation. 'It is a <i>technical rule</i> of the prize courts,' says Mr. Wheation, 'to restore to the individual claimant, in such a case, only on the application of the neutral government whose territory has been thus violated. This rule is founded upon the principle that the neutral state alone has been injured by the capture, and that the <i>hostile claimant has no right to appear for the purpose of suggesting the invalidity of the capture</i>.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Anne</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> the only case in this court upon the question, was of an <i>enemy ship</i>, and so far from disturbing, confirms the position contended for in behalf of neutral claimants.

'<i>The enemy has no rights whatsoever;</i> and if the netural sovereign omits or declines <i>to interpose a claim</i>, the property is condemnable, <i>jure belli</i>, to the captors.' This case is subject to the further criticism, as an authority on this point, that the facts show, and the court so hold, that the protection of neutrality had been forfeited by the captured ship having commenced hostilities against the captor, so that no claim by the neutral sovereign could have been interposed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Richmond</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> was the case of a municipal forfeiture of a vessel of the United States, the seizure having been made in St. Mary's River, within the Spanish territory of Florida.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On such a case, it is obvious that the violation of Spanish territory could never come in issue, judicially, nor could it in anywise protect the vessel against the municipal justice of its own government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon an examination of the decisions of Sir William Scott, it will be found that the cases in which condemnation has passed, for want of the intervention of the neutral government, have been upon actual enemy's property where no claimant could appear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III.

But as trade by neutrals with the enemy, and the purchase of enemy property, except in violation of blockade, are wholly lawful, no consequence of condemnation, <i>from enemy origin</i>, can be pretended.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally.

We could argue, perhaps, that the testimony of all the witnesses taken <i>in preparatorio</i> might, in the discretion of the court, have been well received in furtherance of justice. One of them was a person stationed on a New York vessel, temporarily in the harbor, and could not be subsequently procured. We need not so argue. But undoubtedly the further proofs must be heard.

The locality of the capture, admitting it to have been made in Mexican waters, is unimportant. Mexico makes no remonstrance; in no way objects. We admit the ingenuity and force also of the opposing argument made by Mr. Evarts. But all the authorities agree that capture within neutral territory can only be averred in support of a claim for restoration by the accredited agent of the government whose neutral immunity has been thus infringed. Neither the enemy claimant, who has no standing in the prize courts, nor the citizen claimant, who has made his property liable to condemnation in prize for unlawful trading with the enemy, nor the neutral claimant, who, at the time of capture, is found in the predicament of having laid aside his neutral character, and having, by unneutral conduct, made himself <i>pro hac vice</i> an enemy, can set up for defence against decree of condemnation so incurred, the fact of capture within neutral limits. No case has been or can be produced giving warrant for such allegation. All the adjudged cases state, with equal explicitness and emphasis, first, that the claim of neutral immunity, when properly pleaded by the aggrieved neutral government, is conclusive and effectual in all cases as a defence against a decree of condemnation, and, secondly, that such claim on such ground can be made only by and in behalf of such government whose territorial rights have been infringed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>The Purissima Concepcion</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> the leading British case upon the subject, Lord Stowell stated, in the plainest words he could use, that 'it is a known principle of this court that the privilege of territory will not itself enure to the protection of property, unless the state from which that protection is due steps forward to assert the right.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same doctrine is maintained in the other British cases,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> and in <i>The Anne</i>, in our own.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In no one of these cases does the court attempt to make any distinction between the case of a captured non-combatant <i>enemy</i> and a captured <i>neutral</i> who has forsaken his neutrality, and by his conduct made himself liable to be captured and condemned as an enemy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order issued by the Navy Department to our naval vessels on the 14th of August, 1862, prohibiting the capture of any vessel within the territorial waters of a friendly nation, has no application to a case like this, where the captors proceeded upon the best observations which could be made, and so determined the position of the prize to be such as to make her capture not only lawful, but obligatory upon them in the performance of their duty. The order is intended to protect the territorial immunity of neutral nations, and not to save blockade-runners and contrabandists, in doubtful positions near the neutral line, from the lawful and rightful penalty of their conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III. The testimony brings out the fact made known in other cases, that the whole system of traffic during our rebellion between Matamoras and the British ports, was but a fraudulent pretence of honest and legitimate neutral trade, and that the plan and scheme of the voyages were organized with the purpose of concealing enemy property, and in a manner peculiarly offensive both to the belligerent and the sovereign rights of the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As matter of public law, any neutral vessel engaged and arrested in the prosecution of a traffic so suspicious and demoralizing as that with a neutral along the line of a river on which lay a blockaded and suffering enemy, should be held in a prize court to conclusive proof of her innocence.

The order for further proof was, probably, made upon the rejected depositions, which, though inadmissible as evidence for condemnation, may have been allowed to be used as affidavits on the motion for the order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The further proof, when taken, was conflicting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The weight of evidence, we think, put the vessel, at the time of capture, in Mexican waters; but if the ship or cargo was enemy property, or either was otherwise liable to condemnation, that circumstance, by itself, would not avail the claimants in a prize court. It might constitute a ground of claim by the neutral power, whose territory had suffered trespass, for apology or indemnity. But neither an enemy, nor a neutral, acting the part of an enemy, can demand restitution of captured property on the sole ground of capture in neutral waters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must, therefore, look further into the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is some evidence which justifies suspicion. Several witnesses state facts which tend to prove that the Peel was in the employment of the rebel government; and that part, at least, of the cotton laden upon her, as return cargo, was in fact rebel property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are statements, on the other hand, which make it probable that the Peel was in truth what she professed to be, a merchant steamer, belonging to neutral merchants, and nothing more; that her cargo was consigned in good faith by neutral owners for sale at Matamoras, or to be conveyed across the river and sold in Texas, as it might lawfully be, not being contraband; that the cotton was purchased by neutrals, and on neutral account, with the proceeds of the cargo or other money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this conflict of evidence we do not think ourselves warranted in condemning, or in quite excusing the vessel or her cargo. We shall, therefore, affirm the decree by the District Court, and direct restitution, without costs or expenses to either party as against the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMANCE AND DIRECTION ACCORDINGLY.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> For the suspicious character of all the trade between neutrals and Matamoras, see the statement of the case in The Peterhoff, <i>supra</i>, p. 30, and the chart, <i>supra</i>, p. 173.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Letter of Sir William Scott and Sir John Nicholl to John Jay, 1 Robinson, 389; The Sarah, 3 Id. 330; The Haabet, 6 Id. 54; The George, 1 Wheaton, 408.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Dana's Wheaton, &#167; 426.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Id. &#167; 171.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Id. 429.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Id. &#167; 428.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The Vrow Anna Catharina, 5 Robinson, 18, cited and approved, Dana's Wheaton, &#167; 429.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Lawrence's Wheaton, n. 215, p. 715.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Wheaton on Captures, Appendix, 341.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Mr. Welles to Mr. Seward, March 5, 1864, Diplomatic Correspondence, p. 548.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Vol. ii, p. &#8212;&#8212;.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Dana's Wheaton, &#167; 430.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> 3 Wheaton, 435.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> Id. 447-8.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> 9 Cranch, 102</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> See The Peterhoff, <i>supra</i>, p. 28.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> Mr. Welles to Mr. Seward, Diplomatic Correspondence, 1864, Part II, 548.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> The Bermuda, 3 Wallace, 557.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> Diplomatic Correspondence, 1863, Part I, p. 476, Lord Lyons to Mr. Seward.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> 6 Robinson, 45.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> The Etrusco, cited 3 Robinson, 31; The Eliza Ann, 1 Dodson, 244; The Diligentia, Id. 412.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> 3 Wheaton, 435.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
