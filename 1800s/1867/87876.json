On motion, these libels were consolidated, and various claims were interposed in the consolidated suit for portions of the property libelled. Among these claims was that of Withenbury &amp; Doyle. They denied the validity of the capture, and insisted on their own title to nine hundred and thirty-five bales of the cotton.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon hearing of the cause as to this claim, an order was made dismissing the claim, with costs, for which execution was ordered.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this decree the appeal now pending was taken, and a motion for dismissal was now made, upon the ground that the decree was not final, and therefore was not within the jurisdiction of this court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A motion of a similar sort was made and argued at the same time in another and similar appeal, <i>Le More</i> v. <i>United States</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Messrs.

The suit still remains pending in the District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. In <i>Humiston</i> v. <i>Stainthorp</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> this court, on a question of what is a final decree, assumed as of course the doctrine of <i>The Palmyra</i>,  a case in admiralty, and where Marshell, C.

The decree of the Circuit Court was not <i>final</i> in the sense of the act of Congress. The damages remain undisposed of, and an appeal may still lie upon that part of the decree awarding damages.

Thus we have two adversary sets of claimants, each splitting off from the main case, and from one another, and coming here with their appeals, while the main case still remains in the inferior court. Can appeals be thus evolved indefinitely from the body of one case? We think not; but that on rejecting all the claims against this parcel of cotton, the court below should have proceeded to determine the question of prize, and after that to decide what to do with the proceeds of the cotton, and then to enter a final decree.

The evil impending cannot be repaired by an appeal from a long-deferred definite or final decree of the whole case, or the disposition of all the claims filed in it. <i>Execution</i> of this sentence must go forth in the absence of an appeal.
