The mandate was to levy a specific tax to pay the relator's judgment; the return is, that the tax was levied to pay the judgment and <i>other claims</i>. The nature and extent of these claims were not given, and the court had, therefore, no means of ascertaining whether the fund to be raised would be sufficient for their discharge, and the satisfaction of the relator's demand.
