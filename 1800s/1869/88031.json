The act of March 3d, 1817,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> created four additional auditors and one additional comptroller. It gave the charge of all accounts accruing in the Treasury Department to the first auditor, and made it his duty to report them to the first comptroller. The language employed is the same as that used in the act of 1797. This did not affect the duties of the Commissioner of the General Land Office as to all accounts relating to the public lands, which the act of 1812 had devolved upon him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Receivers and depositaries are required to keep accounts of their contingent expenses.

To allow them to remain in the case was an error, and any instruction given afterwards, short of their withdrawal, was unavailing to cure it. The course proposed to be pursued when the objection by the district attorney was taken, could hardly fail, under any circumstances, to mislead and confuse, and to prevent the proper trial of the cause. The object of pleading is to concentrate the controversy upon the questions of fact and of law, which should control the result.
