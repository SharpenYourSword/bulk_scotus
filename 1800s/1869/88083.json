The question then arises, whether this relation was changed by the intervention of Gregg &amp; Hughes? The defendants in error contend that it was, so far as the shipment of hams was concerned, because they were received as the property of Gregg &amp; Hughes, after notice that it was their property; on the contrary, the plaintiffs in error insist that the relation of principal and factor was unchanged as to all the shipments, for the reason that Gregg &amp; Hughes, after the receipt of the hams by Drakely &amp; Fenton, put themselves in the place of McCabe &amp; Co. in regard to the whole transaction, adopted what had been done in reference to each shipment, and claimed to be the owners of all the property, and did direct and control the disposition of it.

There is no doubt if this consent had been obtained in advance of the making of the contract, that Gregg &amp; Hughes would have been bound by it, and could not free themselves from any of the obligations which rested on McCabe &amp; Co. to discharge.</p>\n<p>But as this consent was not obtained before the movement of the property commenced, the important inquiry is, whether the consignment of hams is separable from the preceding consignments, and whether the loss on the pork and shoulders must be borne by Drakely &amp; Fenton, or by Gregg &amp; Hughes. This must depend on the terms on which the hams were received, and these terms need not be embodied in the form of a written agreement, but can be gathered from the correspondence and conduct of the parties. If the case stood alone, on the naked fact that notice of title was given while the hams were in transitu, there would be no difficulty. But it is claimed that Gregg &amp; Hughes adopted McCabe &amp; Co.'s contract throughout; substituted themselves in their place as to all the consignments \u0097 pork, shoulders, and hams \u0097 and continued in their own name, the relation of principal and factor, before existing between McCabe &amp; Co. and Drakely &amp; Fenton. If this were so, the case would be equally free from difficulty; for, if Gregg &amp; Hughes were not bound by a contract which McCabe &amp; Co. had entered into with reference to their property, they could elect, after being informed of the nature of the contract, to reject it or adopt it. If, with a full knowledge of the facts concerning it, they ratify it, they thereby make themselves a party to it, as much so as if the original agreement had been made with them. And if they ratified it, no new or additional consideration was required to support the ratification, because in adopting the contract, they accepted with it the original consideration on which it was founded, as a sufficient consideration for their adoption of it.</p>\n<p>With this general statement of the principles of law applicable to the controversy, we are met with the inquiry, whether there is any evidence in the case to support the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*268</span> theory of the plaintiffs in error, that Gregg &amp; Hughes intended to, and did, adopt the contract of McCabe &amp; Co. with them. It is not enough that Drakely &amp; Fenton should have so understood the agreement, but the proof must also show that Gregg &amp; Hughes had a similar understanding of it, and manifested their intention to be bound by it.</p>\n<p>The evidence in the case, to which no exception was taken, consists of a voluminous commercial correspondence, and some parol proof, explanatory of the conduct of the parties.

It would be difficult to discuss the evidence in reference to the theory advanced by the plaintiffs in error, without indicating, in a greater or less degree, our views as to the effect that should be given to it.

Drakely &amp; Fenton had agreed to receive, on consignment, from McCabe &amp; Co., <i>hams</i>, shoulders, prime and new pork; to sell the property at the highest market price, and to advance, on each shipment, at certain specified rates. In pursuance of this understanding, McCabe &amp; Co. made two shipments, one of barrelled meat, and the other of shoulders, in tierces, on which they drew drafts in favor of Gregg &amp; Hughes to the amount of $59,000 which were paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after this the <i>hams</i> were sent. On the day succeeding their shipment, the Baltimore firm received a telegram, which was followed by a letter from Gregg &amp; Hughes, of Chicago, claiming title to all the property, and requesting that the bills of lading for the hams might not be negotiated until the whole matter was properly adjusted; and, until then, Drakely &amp; Fenton did not know that Gregg &amp; Hughes had any interest in the property consigned to them. It seemed, from Gregg &amp; Hughes's letter, that they had furnished McCabe &amp; Co. with money to cut and pack hogs, and had taken in security, the warehouse receipts on all the pork products, which afterwards came into the possession of Drakely &amp; Fenton. The intervention of Gregg &amp; Hughes resulted in nothing more being paid to McCabe &amp; Co., and in a final direction from McCabe &amp; Co. to Drakely &amp; Fenton, to place the proceeds of all the pork products consigned to them, to the credit of Gregg &amp; Hughes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appeared, from the conduct of the parties, that there was no apprehension, until long after Gregg &amp; Hughes had intervened, that the portion of these products, covered by the two first shipments, would not bring, when sold, enough to reimburse Drakely &amp; Fenton for what they had advanced on them. But it so happened, in the vicissitudes of trade, that the hog market greatly declined, and that the proceeds of the pork and shoulders were inadequate to repay the money which was advanced upon them. The hams having sold for a large sum over charges and advancements, Drakely &amp; Fenton insisted that they were entitled to a lien on the proceeds, for their general balance arising out of the deficiency on the sale of the pork and shoulders, which right was denied by Gregg &amp; Hughes, and hence this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question depended, of course, upon the fact, whether the intervention of Gregg &amp; Hughes had changed the relation of principal and factor, which had previously existed between McCabe &amp; Co. and Drakely &amp; Fenton, and separated the consignment of hams from the preceding consignments. This, of course, was a question depending on the terms on which the hams had been received.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence, on this point, consisted of a long correspondence, and of some oral testimony. The transactions originated with a letter from McCabe &amp; Co. to the Baltimore house, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CHICAGO, January 6th, 1865.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MESSRS.

L.</i> These shipments they made without our knowledge in their own name, <i>and gave us only a portion of the proceeds of the drafts made on you, payable to our order, viz., one for</i> $41,000, <i>and another for</i> $18,000. TO THIS WE DID NOT MAKE ANY SERIOUS OBJECTION, as they had been cutting a few hogs with money obtained from another source, and we presumed they wanted to close that account. There was still a considerable quantity of lard and hams remaining here, which we supposed was sufficient to secure us for our advances here, in addition to what we had in New York. Subsequently, they shipped the lard to you, on their own account, for which we got nothing yet. Col. McCabe, however, told us that we should have the benefit of anything that might be in your hands, from the sale of the property shipped you on B. L. in the name of McCabe &amp; Co., the lard included, after your advances and charges were paid. <i>We were satisfied with that arrangement, and on Friday last proposed that we would ship to you, in a few days, the hams that were still here, there being then about a thousand tierces in which we were interested, and we would not draw anything upon them until they were sold</i>. Col. McCabe told us, at that time, he would leave on Saturday morning for New York, <i>and we were to attend to the shipping of the hams ourself</i>. To our surprise, this morning (Monday), we found that McCabe did not go to New York, as contemplated, but remained here and shipped the hams himself to your house, on yesterday (Sunday), and this morning left for your city himself. Now, the last move, to us, does not look right, and we are not satisfied with it. We, consequently, write to you <i>all the facts</i> in connection with our dealings with McCabe &amp; Co., and will deem it an especial favor, <i>if you will hold off making further advances to them, over and above the</i> $41,000 <i>and</i> $18,000 <i>sight drafts drawn in our favor. The property shipped you is virtually and legally ours, and we hold McCabe's warehouse receipts for it.</i>. If you will delay the payment of anything further to McCabe &amp; Co. until we can advise with them, and direct the property to be placed with you for our account, we will feel very grateful to you; and if they refuse to comply with our request, we can then take steps to make them surrender the property or reimburse us for our advances. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>We do not wish your interests in the matter to be impaired in the least; we want you to sell all the property consigned to you; but we do not want the proceeds paid over to McCabe &amp; Co., until we are secured, nor do we want any sale for the future made, unless the sales are placed to our credit</i>.

It admits, that they held warehouse receipts for <i>all</i> the property that had been consigned to Drakely &amp; Fenton; that their title to the hams was no better than their title to the pork and shoulders, but was the same; that they saw the letter by which Drakely &amp; Fenton agreed to make advances; that the advances on the first consignments made, to use their own language, 'on the basis of certain figures named' in Drakely &amp; Fenton's letter of the 10th of January, were in drafts to their own order, a part of the proceeds of which they gave to McCabe &amp; Co., to enable them to close an account with other parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It admits, moreover, that, although the first consignment of the property of Gregg &amp; Hughes, was made without authority by McCabe &amp; Co., yet that they made 'no serious objections to it;' in other words they ratified it, and received the proceeds of it, availing themselves of the act of McCabe &amp; Co. as their agents in the premises; that (with a knowledge of the letter of Drakely &amp; Fenton, of January 10th, 1865), they proposed to send to them, the same consignees that McCabe &amp; Co. had employed, the property, which, but for the negotiation opened by McCabe &amp; Co.'s letters of January 6th, and which alone introduced Drakely &amp; Fenton into the transaction, would have been sent to New York.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this letter, Gregg &amp; Hughes propose, in fact, to place themselves in the shoes of McCabe &amp; Co., as regards the property consigned by them to Drakely &amp; Fenton, pork, shoulders, and hams; and although they say, they had <i>not</i> proposed to draw, had they themselves made the shipment of the hams, until they were sold, yet, they did obtain advances on them, as has been seen already, from the correspondence, making a reference, at the time, to the letter of Drakely &amp; Fenton of the 10th of January, which was 'the basis' of the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They claim also in this letter, the proceeds, not of the hams only, but of <i>all</i> the pork products consigned by McCabe &amp; Co. to Drakely &amp; Fenton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same letter admits that it was McCabe's conduct, in forwarding the hams, that created distrust, and produced their telegram and letter of January 22d.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paraphrased, the letter is as follows: 'McCabe &amp; Co. sent you our property without our knowledge; when they informed us of the fact, showed us your letter, and drew drafts for the advance you had agreed to make, payable to our order, we made no objection; and proposed ourselves to send you the balance of the property which they had promised. Finding, however, that they had themselves forwarded it, we distrust them, and while we sanction and adopt the selection of your firm <i>as the consignees of all the property</i>, we give you notice of <i>our title to all the property</i> and request you to hold off making further advances to McCabe &amp; Co.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These admissions prove the transaction to have been one, where the owners of property, after permitting an agent to establish in his own name relations with a third party, or, which is the same thing, not objecting to those relations when he learns they have been established, but availing himself of them, becomes dissatisfied, discloses his ownership, and takes upon himself the further conduct of the business. In other words, the case is one in which the principal, intervening in a transaction between his agent and a factor, has recognized their relations and proceeded to carry them out. That in such a case, the factor would have a lien for his general balance is so clear, that the point need not be discussed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main question, then, is one of fact. Did Gregg &amp; Hughes recognize the relation of principal and factor, established between McCabe &amp; Co. and Drakely &amp; Fenton by the correspondence and acts of the parties respectively, and assume the obligations thereby created in regard to <i>all</i> the property, pork, shoulders, and hams, consigned by the former to the latter?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCabe &amp; Co.'s letter of the 6th January, proposed to forward <i>pork, shoulders, and hams</i>, mentioning the quantities, and inquiring about advances. Drakely &amp; Fenton's letter of 10th January, states what advances will be made. McCabe &amp; Co., January 13th, 1865, advise that shipments will be made accordingly, on the 16th, of the pork; and that the hams and shoulders will go forward the next week. The pork and shoulders go forward accordingly, and drafts amounting to $59,000 are paid. The hams are forwarded also, as promised, <i>by the same parties</i>, on the 21st January, with a bill of lading dated the 23d.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gregg &amp; Hughes intervene on the 22d. Had they not intervened, there would have been no question as to the right of Drakely &amp; Fenton to a lien for their general balance. Their letter of 22d January is a portion of the evidence relied on, to show that this intervention was but the substitution of a principal in place of an agent in dealings with a factor. Was there a reason for such a substitution? Touching <i>all</i> the property, pork, shoulders, and hams, McCabe &amp; Co. were but agents dealing with the property of their principal, whose absolute title was the warehouse receipts. The conduct of the agents exciting distrust, there was a reason why the principal should substitute himself in their place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the use of the words <i>all of the property</i>, in the letter of 22d January, it would be fair to argue that not only the hams, the consignment of which was the occasion of that letter, but the pork and shoulders were meant. The next sentence, however, removes all doubt on this score. 'We desire that they shall have the benefit of everything, <i>the pork, lard, shoulders, and hams</i>, bring over the amount we have on them.' Here then was a setting up of ownership of <i>all</i> the property, assuming the control of <i>all</i> of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The subsequent correspondence corroborates this view, and shows that Gregg &amp; Hughes stepped into the place of R. McCabe &amp; Co., in <i>all</i> respects as regards <i>all</i> the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, it is difficult to see how Gregg &amp; Hughes could make their determination to deal with <i>all the pork products</i> consigned to Drakely &amp; Fenton by McCabe &amp; Co., as their own particular property, plainer than they have done by their letter of 31st January, 1865. Then comes the letter of Drakely &amp; Fenton to Gregg &amp; Hughes, of February 3d, 1865, in which they recognize the claim of the latter to deal with the property as their own, attorning to them, as it were.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the 6th February, Gregg &amp; Hughes wrote to Drakely &amp; Fenton: '<i>We claim the whole of the property&#8212;the hams, pork, and shoulders&#8212;our receipts cover them</i>.' The extracts given in the statement of the case (<i>supra</i>, p. 244 to p. 252) show that Gregg &amp; Hughes at this time made no distinction between the hams, and the pork, and shoulders; but set up the right to deal with all alike.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the correspondence does not leave us merely to infer, from the ownership alone, that the hams were responsible for the advances made or for the general balance, when the final account sales of the whole was rendered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter of February 9th, 1865, not only speaks of the hams and shoulders as in the same category, but refers to the letter of the 10th January, fixing the rate of advances, shown by R. McCabe to Gregg &amp; Hughes, and it distinctly informs Gregg &amp; Hughes that a new rate must be adopted. In other words, the advances originally proposed, owing to the fall of prices, had turned out to be greater than should have been allowed; so that in determining now what was to be advanced hereafter, good margins on all the shipments were to be provided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now was the time for Gregg &amp; Hughes to have made their present point, and to have said: 'We cannot let the hams go in with the pork and shoulders, so as to give you a margin on all the shipments, for that would give you a lien for your general balance. This will never do. The hams were a separate transaction, and must be kept apart from the pork and shoulders. Deal with McCabe &amp; Co. for the latter; but the hams are an especial consignment, to be accounted for by itself.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter in reply is dated February 11th, <i>and makes no comment</i> in this connection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next letter is dated February 22d&#8212;this too <i>is silent upon the subject</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next, dated February 27th, <i>instead of remonstrating</i> against Drakely &amp; Fenton's views in regard to the liability of all the property, pork, shoulders, and hams, for the advances already made, expressly confirms it. They say:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'<i>We hand you memorandum of property in your hands which our order covers, subject to two drafts made by McCabe &amp; Co. on you with transportation and other regular charges</i>.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the memorandum inclosed <i>the hams are put</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">How, in the face of this letter, it can be contended, that the hams were not liable for the two drafts, along with all the other property consigned, is difficult to see.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reason for the change in position, shown by Gregg &amp; Hughes's correspondence <i>after</i> May 8th, is evident. The letter of Drakely &amp; Fenton of that date, reporting the net of all the consignments as not exceeding $10,000, when the net value of the hams alone was so much greater, on which but $10,000 had been advanced, showed the importance of separating the hams from the pork and shoulders, so that the shortcoming of the latter might not become a claim on the proceeds of the former. There would be reason for this change if in truth any distinction could be drawn between 'our hams,' and the 'portions of McCabe &amp; Co.,' by which is meant the pork and shoulders. But there was no such difference. The origin of the title to all these pork products; the actual ownership, as proved by the warehouse receipts; the equitable ownership as security for advances&#8212;all were the same. They were consigned by the same party to the same consignee, Drakely &amp; Fenton. The order of February 25th, directing the proceeds of all the pork products consigned, to be placed to the credit of Gregg &amp; Hughes, made no distinction between 'our hams, and other portions of McCabe &amp; Co.' The previous and subsequent correspondence up to the 12th May made no such distinction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The distinction is not borne out by the fact, and cannot therefore be regarded as having any existence whatever.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding then, Gregg &amp; Hughes as the owners, by the same title, of the pork, shoulders, and hams, we find them, after the pork and shoulders had been consigned without their consent, making no serious objection and receiving the proceeds of the advances; we find them also, after the consignment of the hams without their knowledge, insisting that the <i>whole of the property</i> was 'virtually and legally' theirs, and taking from the consignors an order on Drakely &amp; Fenton for the proceeds of <i>all the pork products consigned;</i> we find them declaring, in so many words, that the property which the order covered, including the hams now in dispute, was subject to the consignors' two drafts, the transportation and other regular charges, the liability now denied; we find them throughout controlling the disposition and management of all the property, and making no objections, when Drakely &amp; Fenton referred to the <i>whole</i> as a security for the advances, leaving them to suppose, if they had ever doubted on the subject, that this was a thing of course; we find them, in a word, acting in the premises as though the relation of factor and principal as to all the consignments, had been extablished between the plaintiffs in error and themselves, until the fall in prices and the indifferent condition of much of the property made it probable that the pork and shoulders would not cover the advances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Surely upon this case there was evidence, if not proving, at least tending to prove our defence, that after the hams were received by Drakely &amp; Fenton, Gregg &amp; Hughes, with entire knowledge of the agreement between McCabe &amp; Co., and Drakely &amp; Fenton, and its partial performance, ratified and adopted it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the evidence but <i>tended</i> to prove this case, the court below erred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As respects the oral testimony of Hughes, it may be said so far as a want of legal precision is suggested in the letter of the 27th February, that it is the legal precision used which frees the case from all doubt. Nothing can well be imagined clearer with regard to what the drafts covered than the expression of that letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Messrs. S. T. Wallis and J. H. Thomas, contra:</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hams being confessedly the property of Gregg &amp; Hughes, could not cease to be theirs, or become subject to a lien in favor of any one else, except by some contract of their own, founded upon a legally adequate consideration, of which there is no pretence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCabe had entered into no obligation to ship the hams to cover possible deficiencies which might arise from advances made on the other meats. The advance on each was specific, the bill of lading always accompanying the draft to show on what it was drawn. Even as against him, Drakely &amp; Fenton had no claim on the hams till in their possession, and he might have diverted the consignment after it was made. If, however, the arrangement between him and these last had been different, Gregg &amp; Hughes only acquiesced in the shipment of the other meats and the imposition of a lien thereupon by him. They reserved their property in the hams, and right to ship them in their own names, and so notified to Drakely &amp; Fenton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If McCabe had been under an obligation to ship the hams, and Gregg &amp; Hughes had been bound by it, they would have been entitled to the corresponding benefits of the contract to the advance of $40 per tierce on the 983 tierces, to $39,323, which is more than the amount they now claim out of them. If they had meant to subordinate their rights to that agreement, they could have got from him drafts to that amount, which the appellants would have been bound to accept. But they never asked for more than $25,000, and the appellants refused to advance even that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gregg &amp; Hughes claimed the hams as their own, claimed none of the benefits, admitted none of the liabilities arising from the contract between McCabe and the other side, except as to the shipment of the pork and shoulders, and the lien imposed on them. They waived no title to the hams, but reserved the right to deal with them as their own property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Their receiving a portion of the proceeds of the drafts drawn on the pork and shoulders, did not affect their right to the hams. It was received, under an agreement with McCabe, that the hams were to continue their own, be shipped by them in their own names, on their own account, and they so wrote to Drakely &amp; Fenton, before the hams went into their possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The taking by Gregg &amp; Hughes of the order for the proceeds of pork and shoulders, and the assignment of the bill of lading for the hams, did not impair the right they already had to the hams. They do not claim title under those papers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The expression used in the letter of the 27th of February, cannot have the effect of subjecting the hams to a lien, or rendering the proceeds of them liable to a deduction for the drafts which had been drawn on the pork and shoulders, in view of all the facts. Even if Gregg &amp; Hughes had meant, and had expressly promised to pay these drafts themselves, or make their hams liable for them, such a promise would have been void for want of consideration. The other side, as acceptors, were bound to pay them to us, and we, if compelled, as indorsers, to pay them to any one else, might have recovered them from the former. It was a debt due by McCabe to Drakely &amp; Fenton, for which our clients were in no way liable, and a promise by them to pay it, or make their property responsible for it, was a promise to answer for the default of another, <i>nudum pactum</i>, and void, under the Statute of Frauds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Admissions are useful to determine doubtful questions, not to take away or qualify clear rights. They must be deliberate, 'not fished out of loose expressions in mercantile correspondence.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gregg &amp; Hughes might have replevied the hams from the railroad company, before they reached Drakely &amp; Fenton, or from these afterwards, on tendering the freight and charges on them specifically. The amount which Drakely &amp; Fenton would have been compelled to tender before replevying them, is still the test as to the character and amount of liability to which they were then subject.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the hams had never been shipped, the loss arising from deficiency of the other meats, to cover advances made on them, would have fallen on the other side, not on us. Nothing in the case justifies the transfer of the loss to us. The other side, having exhausted their security, seek now to exhaust that of our clients, who are creditors of McCabe, and losers by him to a much larger amount than they.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although factors have a lien upon goods actually in their hands, or the proceeds of them for a general balance, it is only for a balance due by the principal, against whom it is sought to be asserted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All the facts assumed in the court's instructions were admitted, and the court, construing the letters between the parties, according to their proper and legal effect and force, was right, in substantially saying to the jury, that they contained no sufficient agreement, whereby the appellants had acquired the right to charge the property of the appellees for advances made on other property, to McCabe, and not to the appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's prayers were properly rejected, because they all fell short of the law of the case. They assumed, that if the jury could establish the relation of principal and factor, between the appellants and appellees, as to all the consignments, a lien upon all would follow as matter of law and matter of course, without reference to the circumstances under which that relation was created, or the intention of the parties who entered into it.

This is a sufficient consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But there is a second answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter of the 27th February is not a single fact in the case, containing a promise, so to speak, for which there was no consideration, but one of a series of facts, going to show that Gregg &amp; Hughes recognized the acts of McCabe &amp; Co. up to that time, and assumed and continued all the obligations of their relations to Drakely &amp; Fenton. Some of these facts are to be found in the admissions of the letter of the 20th January, others in subsequent letters, already commented on; and the letter of the 27th February is but a recognition of a state of things, <i>not created by it, but existing previously</i>, the proof of which it facilitates, and that is all. It is an admission of a fact that was susceptible of proof, less absolute, perhaps, but sufficient for all that, without it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">References to the letters of Gregg &amp; Hughes of March 8th, 15th; to Drakely &amp; Fenton's letter of March 20th; and again to Gregg &amp; Hughes's letter of April 25th, corroborate the views taken by us of their relations to all their property in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recollecting that but $10,000 had been advanced on the hams, which, under unfavorable circumstances, produced $37,694.76, it is impossible to read this last letter and believe that, when it was written, Gregg &amp; Hughes believed that the hams were a separate transaction, or that they were not liable for the general balance on final account, embracing all the consignments. The whole tone of the letter corroborates the view taken by us in the relations between them and the other side touching all the consignments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice DAVIS delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The correctness of the charge of the court to the jury, and the refusal of the court to charge as requested, present the only questions in this case which we are required to consider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs in error, who were the defendants below, insist that they are injured by the action of the court in not allowing their defence to go to the jury. Their position is, that the evidence in the case proved their defence, or, at least, tended to prove it; and if it did, it was the province of the jury, and not of the court, to say what effect should be given to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not denied, that in the dealings between McCabe &amp; Co. and Drakely &amp; Fenton, there existed the relation of principal and factor, and that if Gregg &amp; Hughes had not intervened, Drakely &amp; Fenton would have had a lien on the surplus, after all the consignments were closed up, for their general balance. The question then arises, whether this relation was changed by the intervention of Gregg &amp; Hughes? The defendants in error contend that it was, so far as the shipment of hams was concerned, because they were received as the property of Gregg &amp; Hughes, after notice that it was their property; on the contrary, the plaintiffs in error insist that the relation of principal and factor was unchanged as to all the shipments, for the reason that Gregg &amp; Hughes, after the receipt of the hams by Drakely &amp; Fenton, put themselves in the place of McCabe &amp; Co. in regard to the whole transaction, adopted what had been done in reference to each shipment, and claimed to be the owners of all the property, and did direct and control the disposition of it. The case was tried substantially on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no dispute that the warehouse receipts gave to Gregg &amp; Hughes the legal title to all the property described in them; and if so, it necessarily follows that McCabe &amp; Co. could not lawfully contract with Drakely &amp; Fenton to receive and sell this property without the consent of Gregg &amp; Hughes. There is no doubt if this consent had been obtained in advance of the making of the contract, that Gregg &amp; Hughes would have been bound by it, and could not free themselves from any of the obligations which rested on McCabe &amp; Co. to discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But as this consent was not obtained before the movement of the property commenced, the important inquiry is, whether the consignment of hams is separable from the preceding consignments, and whether the loss on the pork and shoulders must be borne by Drakely &amp; Fenton, or by Gregg &amp; Hughes. This must depend on the terms on which the hams were received, and these terms need not be embodied in the form of a written agreement, but can be gathered from the correspondence and conduct of the parties. If the case stood alone, on the naked fact that notice of title was given while the hams were <i>in transitu</i>, there would be no difficulty. But it is claimed that Gregg &amp; Hughes adopted McCabe &amp; Co.'s contract throughout; substituted themselves in their place as to all the consignments&#8212;pork, shoulders, and hams&#8212;and continued in their own name, the relation of principal and factor, before existing between McCabe &amp; Co. and Drakely &amp; Fenton. If this were so, the case would be equally free from difficulty; for, if Gregg &amp; Hughes were not bound by a contract which McCabe &amp; Co. had entered into with reference to their property, they could elect, after being informed of the nature of the contract, to reject it or adopt it. If, with a full knowledge of the facts concerning it, they ratify it, they thereby make themselves a party to it, as much so as if the original agreement had been made with them. And if they ratified it, no new or additional consideration was required to support the ratification, because in adopting the contract, they accepted with it the original consideration on which it was founded, as a sufficient consideration for their adoption of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this general statement of the principles of law applicable to the controversy, we are met with the inquiry, whether there is any evidence in the case to support the theory of the plaintiffs in error, that Gregg &amp; Hughes intended to, and did, adopt the contract of McCabe &amp; Co. with them. It is not enough that Drakely &amp; Fenton should have so understood the agreement, but the proof must also show that Gregg &amp; Hughes had a similar understanding of it, and manifested their intention to be bound by it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence in the case, to which no exception was taken, consists of a voluminous commercial correspondence, and some parol proof, explanatory of the conduct of the parties. The correspondence covers many pages of the record, and there is a marked difference in its tone and bearing after it had progressed for several months. It would be difficult to discuss the evidence in reference to the theory advanced by the plaintiffs in error, without indicating, in a greater or less degree, our views as to the effect that should be given to it. If the case is to be tried again, it is not proper to do this, for in that event it is the province of the learned court and the jury to determine the effect of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only question with which we have to deal at the present time is, whether the evidence in this record <i>tended</i> to prove the position assumed by the plaintiffs in error; for if it did, the learned court should either have submitted the evidence on this point to the consideration of the jury, or if, in the opinion of the court, there were no material extraneous facts bearing on this question, and the contract relied on must be determined by the commercial correspondence alone, then to have interpreted this correspondence and informed the jury whether or not it proved the contract to be of the character contended for by the plaintiffs in error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have examined the record in this case carefully, and are of the opinion that there was evidence at the trial which tended to prove that, after the hams were received by Drakely &amp; Fenton, Gregg &amp; Hughes, with full knowledge of the agreement between McCabe &amp; Co. and Drakely &amp; Fenton, and its partial performance, ratified and adopted it. Whether the evidence actually proves this ratification and adoption, we express no opinion. It is enough, as we have seen, for the purposes of this writ of error, that it tended to prove it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the learned court below submitted the case to the jury, on the single issue of legal title to the hams in Gregg &amp; Hughes, and notice of that title to Drakely &amp; Fenton, it follows that the judgment of the Circuit Court should be reversed, and a</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VENIRE DE NOVO AWARDED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Gist <i>v.</i> Cockey, 7 Harris &amp; Johnson, 140; Robinson <i>v.</i> Marshall, 11 Maryland, 253, 4; Northern Central R.
