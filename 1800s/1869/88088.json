This act being in force and governing the appeals mentioned, an act of February, 1847,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> established the District Court for the Southern District of Florida, with the jurisdiction and powers of a District and Circuit Court of the United States; and appeals were allowed from its decrees in the same manner, and under the same regulations as appeals from a Circuit Court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the 15th of July, 1862,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Congress passed an act establishing a Circuit Court for a circuit which included the Southern District of Florida, and repealing the former act conferring upon the District Court Circuit Court jurisdiction.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this state of the law, on the 4th of August, 1862, that is to say, nineteen days after this last statute was enacted, the District Court passed a decree condemning the schooner Lucy, and on the 15th, allowed an appeal to this court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record was, in the October following, filed in the Circuit Court for the district 'by reason of the act of Congress, approved July 15th, 1862, establishing a Circuit Court in said district.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Afterward, to wit, May 1st, 1867, the cause was transferred to the Supreme Court of the United States by consent of all parties in interest, and the case so came up here from the Circuit Court.
