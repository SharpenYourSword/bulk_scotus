Butler made and delivered to Isett &amp; Brewster, a banking firm of Muscatine, Iowa, his five several promissory notes for $2,000 each, payable to their order in one, two, three, four, and five years from date, and at the same time made and delivered to them a mortgage on certain real estate to secure the payment of the notes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff, Finley, on the 22d January, 1866, filed this bill in chancery, alleging that the notes and mortgage were deposited with Isett &amp; Brewster, in trust for his benefit, for the purpose of securing Butler's indebtedness to him, and praying the court to declare the trust, and decree Isett &amp; Brewster to assign to him the notes and mortgage, or for such other relief as might be appropriate. Butler is also made defendant, and all three of them required to answer specific interrogatories, under oath, touching the alleged trust.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Isett &amp; Brewster file separate answers, and say that the notes were delivered to them as security for advances made by them to Butler, to enable him to carry on the business of packing pork during the previous winter, and with an understanding that, when their debt was paid, they would transfer the notes and mortgage to whomsoever Butler might direct. They allege that Butler is still indebted to them in the sum of $6,000, and say they are willing to transfer the securities to plaintiff on payment of that sum and interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There seems to be no doubt about Butler's indebtedness to Isett &amp; Brewster, and to complainant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue, therefore, is a very simple question of fact, namely, whether Isett &amp; Brewster received the notes and mortgage from Butler as a security, primarily for their own debt, and then subject to his order, or as a mere trust for plaintiff, without any beneficial interest in themselves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main reliance of plaintiff to establish the trust is on a letter written by Butler to him, at or about the time he delivered the securities to Isett &amp; Brewster.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this letter Butler says: 'For the purpose of protecting you to some extent against worthless securities, I executed my notes, on the 11th of March, at one, two, three, four, and five years, with interest at six per cent., to order of Messrs. Isett &amp; Brewster, and secured the same by mortgage on my pork house, and the mortgage was recorded; and Messrs. Isett &amp; Brewster hold these notes in trust, and will, at proper time, transfer them, with mortgage (without recourse), to parties I may designate.
