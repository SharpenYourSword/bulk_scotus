If upon such petition or suggestion any judge who concurred in the decision thinks proper to move for a rehearing the motion will be considered. If not so moved the rehearing will be denied as of course.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Brown v. Aspden, 14 Howard, 25; United States v. Knight's Adm., 1 Black, 489.</p>\n\n</div>",
