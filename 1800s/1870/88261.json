At the termination of the partnership the stock on hand, books, and unsettled accounts, were turned over by Gunnell to Bird and Hepburn, who collected $7775.68 (including what they had previously received), and retained in hand bad and uncollected debts to the amount, in 1852, when, as hereafter mentioned, the case came before the auditor, of $5461.56.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties were unable to agree upon a settlement of the partnership accounts, and Bird and Hepburn filed their bill in August, 1850, against Gunnell to obtain an adjustment.

But the bad and uncollected debts being deducted, the profit is reduced to $13,149.31; one-half of which, besides his or their original capital, belonged to each party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Gunnell's capital was $6,627 56</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">His half of the profits was 6,574 65</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Total amount due to Gunnell, $13,202 21</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Bird and Hepburn's capital was $7,775 65</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Their half of the profits was 6,574 66</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Total amount due to Bird and Hepburn, $14,350 31 There remains to be adjusted a question of interest due to Bird and Hepburn for having contributed more capital than Gunnell whilst the business was being carried on. The auditor makes this interest $183.52, one-half of which should be deducted from the share of Gunnell, and added to that of Bird and Hepburn. This would reduce the former to $13,110.45, and raise the latter to $14,442.07.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now the books show that Bird and Hepburn drew and collected only $7552.68.

They are simply deducted from the profits, and the loss is thus equally divided. It is claimed by the defendant that Bird and Hepburn should be charged with the whole of this loss because they had the securities and failed to collect them, when, by the use of due diligence, they might have done it. This fact does not appear in the case except by the unsupported allegation of the defendant, made in his answer to the bill of revivor. This portion of the answer was entirely impertinent to the bill, which was strictly and purely a bill of revivor. No formal replication was required to avoid its effect as evidence in the cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The result is that the complainants are entitled to a decree against the defendant for the sum of $6889.39, with interest from the 1st day of May, 1849, and costs.

But the bad and uncollected debts being deducted, the profit is reduced to $13,149.31; one-half of which, besides his or their original capital, belonged to each party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Gunnell's capital was $6,627 56</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">His half of the profits was 6,574 65</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Total amount due to Gunnell, $13,202 21</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Bird and Hepburn's capital was $7,775 65</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Their half of the profits was 6,574 66</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Total amount due to Bird and Hepburn, $14,350 31 There remains to be adjusted a question of interest due to Bird and Hepburn for having contributed more capital than Gunnell whilst the business was being carried on. The auditor makes this interest $183.52, one-half of which should be deducted from the share of Gunnell, and added to that of Bird and Hepburn. This would reduce the former to $13,110.45, and raise the latter to $14,442.07.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now the books show that Bird and Hepburn drew and collected only $7552.68. This left a balance still due them of $6889.39 to be accounted for by Gunnell.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this account neither party is charged with the bad and uncollected debts. They are simply deducted from the profits, and the loss is thus equally divided. It is claimed by the defendant that Bird and Hepburn should be charged with the whole of this loss because they had the securities and failed to collect them, when, by the use of due diligence, they might have done it. This fact does not appear in the case except by the unsupported allegation of the defendant, made in his answer to the bill of revivor. This portion of the answer was entirely impertinent to the bill, which was strictly and purely a bill of revivor. No formal replication was required to avoid its effect as evidence in the cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The result is that the complainants are entitled to a decree against the defendant for the sum of $6889.39, with interest from the 1st day of May, 1849, and costs. The decree of the District Court must be REVERSED, and a decree rendered</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FOR THE COMPLAINANTS ACCORDINGLY.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "id": 88261, "judges": "", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/88261/", "sha1": "ae55c0ba03a70a8cabe94fb14fb9d0f63647b1b9", "source": "R", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:01:35"}
