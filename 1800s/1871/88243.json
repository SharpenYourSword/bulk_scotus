Chiles having been served, put in his answer on May 25th, 1867, in which he accounted specifically for some fifty-one of the bonds. The court decreed that the complainant was entitled to recover the possession of the bonds transferred to White &amp; Chiles, which, <i>at the several times of service of the process in the suit</i>, were in the possession or control of the defendants respectively, or of any proceeds, &amp;c., with notice of the equity; and then proceeded to determine for how many and for which bonds, or their proceeds, the defendants respectively were accountable. But <i>no decree was entered against Chiles for either bonds or proceeds</i>.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Durant, for the State of Texas</i>, now made a motion on the foot of the decree for a rule on Chiles to show cause why he should not deliver to the clerk of this court twelve of these bonds, which it was charged that he had in his posession and had not accounted for.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only proofs furnished upon which the rule was prayed for were the answer of White, a co-defendant, and a deposition of one McKinley, <i>all in the original case</i>, and an affidavit of one George Taylor, produced on this motion. The deposition of McKinley showed that some time in <i>the summer</i> of 1867 he thought he delivered to Chilest ten bonds that had been deposited with him as a banker about a year previous for a third person on certain conditions, which had not been complied with. According to the affidavit of Taylor, Chiles admitted to him that he had received of E. K. Thompson, cashier of the Branch Bank of Kentucky, two bonds, <i>after the service of the injunction in the case</i>, and which he said he held subject to the order of the court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Hughes opposed the motion</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice NELSON, having recapitulated the facts, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The answer of White, which is one of the proofs on which the present rule is prayed for, not being competent evidence against a co-defendant, needs no notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No decree was entered against Chiles for bonds or proceeds, although the same evidence was then before this court, as it respects ten of the bonds in question, as is presented in support of this motion.

The decree, in terms, limits the accounting of the defendants to bonds in their possession at the several times of the service of the process in this suit. The case, therefore, presented is not within the scope or tenor of the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MOTION DENIED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> See the report, with the decree, 7 Wallace, 700, 741.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>77 U.S. 127 (1869)</b></center>\n<center><b>10 Wall. 127</b></center>\n<center><h1>TEXAS<br>\nv.<br>\nCHILES.</h1></center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center></center>\n<p>Mr. Durant, for the State of Texas.</p>\n<p>Mr. Hughes opposed the motion.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> Mr. Justice NELSON, having recapitulated the facts, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>The answer of White, which is one of the proofs on which the present rule is prayed for, not being competent evidence against a co-defendant, needs no notice.</p>\n<p>No decree was entered against Chiles for bonds or proceeds, although the same evidence was then before this court, as it respects ten of the bonds in question, as is presented in support of this motion.
