A mode is provided in the act by which instruments may be stamped after being issued.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These provisions being in force, Wilcox sued A. &amp;. L. Campbell in the court below, declaring upon four promissory notes of theirs, dated 4th August, 1866. The declaration contained the usual averments according to the established precedents in such cases, but did not aver that the notes were stamped as required by the act of Congress, either at their date or at any subsequent time. The defendants demurred generally. The demurrer was overruled, and they pleaded to the merits. The case being submitted by consent to the court without the intervention of a jury, judgment was given in favor of the plaintiffs for $10,805 On error the only question was on the demurrer.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Mr. Stanbery, for the plaintiff in error:</i>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The English precedents of declaration upon instruments subject to stamp duties, do not indeed contain an averment that they were stamped at their date, or at any subsequent time, but they are not in point, for the want of a stamp does not in England invalidate the instrument, but only excludes it from being used in evidence <i>until</i> stamped. Our statutes declare the unstamped instrument <i>invalid</i> until a stamp is affixed by an application to an internal revenue officer. If the stamp is necessary to give <i>validity</i> to the instrument, it would seem that the declaration should aver that the note was stamped.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. W.
