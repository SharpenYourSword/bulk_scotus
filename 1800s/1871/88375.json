Huchberger brought suit against the Merchants' Insurance Company of Providence, R. I., declaring upon a contract to insure them for one year from September 14th, 1866, against loss by fire on their goods 'contained in the brick building No. 173 Lake Street, Chicago.' The <i>narr</i> also set out that it was provided in the policy that if the <i>situation of the property</i> should during the existence of the policy be <i>changed by the assured</i>, the policy should be void; and also it should be void, unless countersigned by the agents of said Merchants' Insurance Company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the averment of interest in the property insured, the <i>narr</i> continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'And the said plaintiffs aver that afterwards, to wit, on the 2d of March, A.

The inference from the allegations which are made is clearly enough that the goods were burned in the building where they were insured; but if it were not so, the declaration in this respect is as specific as the policy.
