By that act the Court of Claims is authorized 'at any time, while any suit or claim is pending before, or on appeal from, said court, or within two years next after the final disposition of any such suit or claim,' to grant a new trial on motion of the United States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion was opposed by <i>Mr. J. Hughes</i>, for the appellee,</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1st. On account of the fact which he stated, that the record and minutes of the Court of Claims showed, to wit, that more than two years had elapsed after judgment in the Court of Claims was given before a new trial was asked for.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2d. Because if a party, by the mere filing of a motion for a new trial in the court below, after appeal taken here, could get a continuance, an appellee might be delayed in this court indefinitely. The case would be different, he admitted, if a new trial had been actually granted; for then indeed a dismissal of the appeal might be asked.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of the <i>United States</i> v. <i>Ayres</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> this court denied a motion to dismiss an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims when the motion was made upon the sole ground that a motion for a new trial had been made by the United States, and was pending in that court, but afterwards dismissed the same appeal when a new trial had been granted.
