That court dismissed the libel; but, on appeal, the Circuit Court reversed the decree and sent the case to a master, to report the amount due. The master, on the 15th July, 1868, reported $1982. The Circuit Court confirmed the report, and on the 11th February, 1870, decreed in favor of the libellant for the amount reported, <i>with interest from the date of the report</i>. Adding the one year, six months, and twenty-six days' interest to the amount given by the report the sum was $2200 and upwards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this state of facts, <i>Mr. Orville Horwitz, for the appellee</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> moved to dismiss, on the ground that the $2000 necessary to give this court jurisdiction did not exist, unless by adding interest to the amount claimed, or to that reported due.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute, it will be remembered, gives an appeal 'where the sum in dispute, exclusive of costs, exceeds $2000.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Donohue, contra</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The CHIEF JUSTICE:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decree of the Circuit Court was for the amount reported due the libellant on the 15th July, 1868, $1982, <i>and interest from the date of the report</i>.
