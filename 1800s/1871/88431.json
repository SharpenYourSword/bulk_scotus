This rule required that where the case was such as is ordinarily settled in any executive department, the petition should show that application for its allowance had been made to that department, and without success, and its decision thereon.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the action of the court, Clyde, the claimant, appealed to this court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Messrs.
