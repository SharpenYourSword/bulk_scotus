The findings of <i>the court</i> upon the facts . . . shall have the same effect as the verdict of a jury.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this statute in force, Bethell sued Mathews in the court below on certain promissory notes. A written stipulation signed by the parties was filed, waiving a jury and submitting the cause for trial by the court. It was so tried, accordingly. Six bills of exception, all by the defendant, were taken to testimony offered by the plaintiff, and all overruled. On the 2d of May, 1870, for reasons orally assigned, the court, <i>not having made any findings of fact</i>, ordered 'that judgment be entered in favor of the defendant,' and it was so signed accordingly four days afterwards. On the 10th of June, thirty-nine days after the judgment was rendered, the counsel filed a 'statement of facts proved in the case,' which statement was signed by <i>them</i>. The present writ of error was taken to review the judgment given in the case; the record disclosing the proceedings as above mentioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Messrs. Miles Taylor and C. N. Morse, for the plaintiff in error</i>, submitted the case on merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Mr. T. J. Durant, contra:</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts or case should have been found by the court. The statute is imperative. A case agreed on by connsel after the judgment cannot possibly be intended as found by the court. At any rate the finding should precede the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, then, only a general finding in favor of the defendant, which must have the same effect as a similar finding of a jury. The case is thus presented to this court, as if on a writ of error to a judgment of the court rendered on a general verdict in favor of the defendant in error, and where there is no question arising on the pleadings, and where there was no ruling on the trial of the cause against the plaintiff in error. In such a case the judgment of the lower court must be affirmed as of course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The CHIEF JUSTICE:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has been often decided that a plaintiff in error cannot take advantage of rulings upon exceptions in his own favor, even if erroneous.
