Thus, in section 22 of the act of 1861, a duty is imposed upon 'articles worn by men, women, or children, of whatever material composed,' &amp;c.; and yet, notwithstanding these comprehensive terms, there follow, in the same section, numerous particulars already clearly embraced in those terms, as 'bracelets, braids, chains, curls, ringlets, braces, suspenders, caps, hats,' &amp;c. Like repetitions are found in the 13th section of the act of July 14th, 1862,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and in schedule C, in the act of July 30th, 1846.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The phrase, all 'other live animals,' as employed in the act of 1866, is clear, comprehensive, and explicit. The addition of the designation of birds, in a single instance, in a former act, is a casual circumstance of too slight significance to warrant a practical interpolation, in the later special statute, of an exception to its plain import.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Frederick Chase, contra</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice DAVIS delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The act of 1866 in its terms is comprehensive enough to include birds, and all other living things endowed with sensation and the power of voluntary motion, and if there had not been previous legislation on the subject there might be some justification for the position, that Congress did not intend to narrow the meaning of the language employed. If it be true that it is the duty of the court to ascertain the meaning of the legislature from the words used in the statute and the subject-matter to which it relates, there is an equal duty to restrict the meaning of general words, whenever it is found necessary to do so, in order to carry out the legislative intention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> And it is fair to presume in case a special meaning were attached to certain words in a prior tariff act, that Congress intended they should have the same signification when used in a subsequent act in relation to the same subject-matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This act of 1861 was in force when the act of 1866&#8212;the act in controversy&#8212;was passed, and it will be seen that birds and fowls are not embraced in the term 'animals,' and that they are free from duty, not because they belong to the class of 'living animals of all kinds,' but for the reason that they are especially designated. It is quite manifest that Congress, adopting the popular signification of the word 'animals,' applied it to quadrupeds, and placed birds and fowls in a different classification. Congress having, therefore, defined the word in one act, so as to limit its application, how can it be contended that the definition shall be enlarged in the next act on the same subject, when there is no language used indicating an intention to produce such a result? Both acts are <i>in pari materi a</i>, and it will be presumed that if the same word be used in both, and a special meaning were given it in the first act, that it was intended it should receive the same interpretation in the latter act, in the absence of anything to show a contrary intention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If it be used in a different sense in the act of 1866, its meaning instead of being extended is narrowed, for all animals not <i>ejusdem generis</i> 'with horses, mules, cattle, sheep, and hogs,' are excluded from the operation of the revenue laws.
