On the trial in the Pulaski County Court, the court was requested by the defendant to hold, that if it appeared from the evidence that the judge who presided in the court at New Orleans and rendered the judgment, held his office by appointment of a military governor of the State of Louisiana, and under no other authority, the judgment was void. But the Pulaski County Court did not so hold, but held to the contrary; and the Supreme Court of Arkansas affirmed its judgment. The case was now brought here under an assumption that it came within the third clause of the 25th section of the Judiciary Act (quoted <i>supra</i>, p. 3), which gives a right to bring bere for review any suit 'where is drawn in question the validity of any clause of the Constitution . . . or commission held under the United States, and the decision is against the title, right, privilege, or exemption specially set up or claimed <i>by either party</i> under such clause.' The title, right, privilege, or exemption here meant to be set up was one by the defendant, and was supposed to arise under two clauses<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> of the Constitution, which ordain as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the <i>Congress</i> shall from time to time ordain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The <i>President of the United States</i> . . . shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate shall appoint judges of the Supreme Court, and <i>all other officers of the United States</i>, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, which shall be established by law.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. W.
