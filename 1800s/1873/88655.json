Notwithstanding this the marshal advertised the same land for sale under other executions. Hereupon one Burrows, alleging that <i>he</i> had purchased and paid for the land, and had tendered the marshal a proper draft of a deed to him, obtained a rule on the marshal to show cause why he should not make such a deed, and why another sale under the other executions should not be stayed.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The marshal set up by way of answer that Burrows was not the purchaser, but that one Meacham was; that the and had sold at an enormous sacrifice, the result of a fraudulent combination between Burrows, Meacham, and Taylor, to prevent competition in the bidding.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below having heard the case on its merits dismissed Burrows's petition, and ordered him to pay all the costs.

The proceeding in which Burrows made his motion below was at law, and the motion was a motion at law.
