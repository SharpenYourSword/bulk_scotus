The ground of the action was that the several transfers were frauds on the bankrupt law under the 35th section thereof&#8212;a section in these words:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'If any person, being insolvent or in contemplation of insolvency or bankruptcy, within six months before the filing of the petition by or against him, makes any payment, <i>sale</i>, assignment, transfer, conveyance, or other disposition of any part of his property to any person who then has reasonable cause to believe him to be insolvent, or to be acting in contemplation of insolvency, and that such payment, <i>sale</i>, assignment, transfer, or other conveyance, is made with a view to prevent his property from coming to his assignee in bankruptcy, or to prevent the same from being distributed under this act, or to defeat the object of, or in any way impair, hinder, impede, or delay the operation and effect of, or to evade any of the provisions of this act, the sale, assignment, transfer, or conveyance shall be void, and the assignee may recover the property or the value thereof as assets of the bankrupt; and if such <i>sale</i>, assignment, transfer, or conveyance <i>is not made in the usual and ordinary course of business of the debtor, the fact shall be</i> prim a facie <i>evidence of fraud</i>.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of the case which were undisputed, were thus:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November, 1868, Mendelson, doing business in Kingsville, a small town in the interior of Missouri, as a retail country merchant, wrote to one Summerfield, who was his brother-in-law, living in St. Louis and engaged there in the furniture business, to bring some money and come and buy him out. Summerfield at once went to Kingsville, and took, in currency, money enough for the purpose. On his arrival there Mendelson told him he was desirous of selling his stock, because he could not succeed in the business in which he was engaged, and wished to deal in furniture and hardware. An account of stock was taken, and Summerfield paid Mendelson for it after deducting 25 per cent. off the cost price. Soon after this purchase Summerfield, leaving Mendelson in possession of the store, went to Chillicothe, Missouri, and told Walbrun &amp; Co., a firm there with which he had some acquaintance, of his pur hase of the stock of goods at 25 per cent. below cost, because the owner wanted to go into the furniture business, and that, as he only desired to make 5 per cent., he would resell to them at 20 per cent. below cost. They agreed to take the goods at his offer, as they needed some of the articles to replenish their stock, if they came up to the account that was given of them. Accordingly, one Ritter, a member of the firm, went back of Kingsville with Summerfield. They found Mendelson still in charge of the store. Some of the goods were boxed up and some on the shelves. In making his purchase, Ritter made no inquiry of the pecuniary condition of either Mendelson or Summerfield. Both parties lodged at Mendelson's house. The morning after arriving they commenced examining the goods at the store, and found some of them in bad condition, of which Ritter complained. After measuring several pieces, to see if the stock conformed to the inventory, Summerfield excused himself from further service on the ground that he had to return to St. Louis, as he had just learned of the sickness of his wife, and told Ritter to take the goods home with him, and if the inventory was defective he would make it right. Ritter replied that he thought that if they would work hard they could soon get through, but finally yielded to Summerfield's persuasions, and, with the assistance of Mendelson, boxed the goods up and shipped them to Chillicothe. Ritter paid the full inventory price at the agreed rate, and both parties left Kingsville that night for their respective homes. Mendelson's debts at the time of this sale were about $9000. This stock of goods was all the property worth naming that he had. The price given by Summerfield for it was $5373.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the 24th of December, 1868, on petition of his creditors, Mendelson was adjudicated a bankrupt. The money received by him from Summerfield for the goods did not reach his creditors, as, according to his own statement, he lost it.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were other facts and circumstances connected with the transactions which invited inquiry, but, as they were represented differently in the sworn testimony of the different witnesses, they are not given as any part of the case. All the witnesses agreed in the case as stated above, and as this court considered, there was no necessity, for the purposes of this suit, of going beyond it.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below gave several instructions bearing, some of them, on these disputed parts of the case. These instructions were assigned for error, though in several points not unfavorable to the defendant. But on the whole case, embracing the undisputed parts of the suit (the case as above given), the court directed the jury to find for the plaintiff. Verdict and judgment went accordingly. The defendants now brought the case here.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. T. J.

Ritter, when he purchased, knew the nature of Summerfield's title, because he knew, or ought to have known, that a retail dealer like Mendelson, in selling out his entire stock, was presumptively guilty of intending to defraud his creditors, if it should turn out that he had any. Of this the bankrupt law gave him distinct notice, and as he chose, like Summerfield, to remain ignorant of Mendelson's affairs, he took the hazard of Summerfield's inability to prove the fairness of his title. It follows that if the sale to Summerfield cannot be supported, neither can the sale by him to the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unnecessary to notice the exceptions taken to the admission or rejection of testimony, because our decision is based on the evidence which was received without objection, and about which there is no controversy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[See the next following case, and also Smith <i>v.</i> Buchanan, <i>supra</i>, p. 277.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 14 Stat. at Large, 534.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Bevans <i>v.</i> The United States, 13 Wallace, 56.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Scammon, Assignee, <i>v.</i> Cole, 5 National Bankruptcy Register, 257; Graham <i>v.</i> Stark et al., 3 Id. 95; Kingsbury et al. <i>v.</i> Hale, Ib. 84; Driggs <i>v.</i> Moore, Ib. 149; Tuttle <i>v.</i> Truax, 1 Id. 169.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
