The claim of Rodd under the mortgage was $4825, and of his co-mortgagees over (in the aggregate) $8000. The claims of the opposing mariners, furnishers of supplies, and material-men were $10,151.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case coming before the District Court that court ordered that the fund in dispute should be paid to Rodd and the others in satisfaction of the mortgage claims. This gave Rodd, who was the largest of the mortgage creditors, $1498.99 as his <i>pro rata share</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this decree of the District Court the mariners, furnishers of supplies, and material-men appealed; and on the appeal, the Circuit Court, on the 3<i>d of June</i>, 1872, ordered that the decree of the District Court 'be avoided and reversed;' and decreed that 'the claims of the mariners, furnishers of supplies, and material-men be recognized as superior to those of the mortgage creditors and paid in preference to the latter, and that a new distribution of the proceeds be prepared by the commissioner in accordance with the principles thus laid down.'A new table of distribution having been prepared accordingly, and reported to the court, the following order was entered on the 6<i>th of June</i>, 1872:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The commissioner having submitted a distribution based <i>upon the decree heretofore made</i> by the court, it is ordered and decreed that the balance of the proceeds of the steamer, now in the registry of this court, be distributed as follows:'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And then followed the names of the distributees and the <i>pro rata</i> sum awarded to each.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This decree being made, Rodd and his co-mortgagees, by one petition filed in the Circuit Court, <i>on the</i> 15<i>th of June</i>, 1872 (but one Sunday having intervened between that day and the preceding 3d of June), prayed an appeal; and on the same day, the <i>district</i> judge sitting in the Circuit Court, allowed it.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. R. De Gray, for the motion</i>, asked the dismissal of the appeal on three grounds:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First. That the appeal was from a decree of the Circuit Court, reversing a decree of the District Court, and was allowed by the district judge; who, though the Judiciary Act makes him a member of the Circuit Court, yet provided 'that no district judge shall give a vote in any cause of appeal . . . from his own decision.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second. Because no one of the claims exceeded $2000; Rodd's, which was the largest, being but $1498.99, and the Judiciary Acts giving an appeal only 'where the matter in dispute exceeds $2000.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third. Because the appeal was not in time to operate as a supersedeas; more than ten days, as the learned counsel alleged, having elapsed from the 3d of June, when, as <i>he</i> contended, the final decree was entered, till the 15th, when the appeal was allowed, and the Judiciary Act of 1789, making a writ of error (to which by an act of 1803 any appeal conforms) a supersedeas only in cases where it is served within ten days (Sundays excepted) after the decree has passed.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. T. J. Semmes, contra</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first of the grounds, on which a dismissal of this appeal is asked, on looking into the acts of Congress relating to the connection of the district judge with the Circuit Court, we are of opinion that, though upon appeals from the District Court the district judge has no vote in the Circuit Court, he has in all other respects the powers of a member of the court, and may consequently allow appeals from its decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Secondly, it is apparent that, though no one of the claims allowed exceeded $2000, yet the claim of the appellants, which was disallowed, exceeded that sum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thirdly, we are of opinion that the decree may be considered as of either the 3d day of June or the 6th day of June, 1872, and that the appeal was in time to operate as a supersedeas under the act of 1789.
