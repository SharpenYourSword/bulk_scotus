That, <i>ex. gr.</i>, by comparing quarterly return for the third quarter of 1844 with report No. 5688 and the statement of differences, it will appear that Barrett claimed credit for $4394.65 for contingent expenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> He was allowed only $783.46<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> in the report, $3611.19 being disallowed, but the detail of the items disallowed, as appeared by the statement of differences, amounts to only $3239.13,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and there is no detail or specification of the balance of the $3611.19 disallowed, nor is there any information explanation in the transcript of what composes that balance, or why it was disallowed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">'And further, that the said reports and statements of differences did not contain or exhibit the accounts as they were presented to and acted upon by the accounting officers of the department, nor their action nor their proceedings relative thereto.'</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">The court held the objections good, and rejected the evidence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">The government afterwards offered in evidence certified copies of the several quarterly statements of accounts rendered by Barrett himself to the United States, 'which said certified copies aforesaid were and are on file in the suit, having been filed with the petition and contained in the said document, marked and already made part of this bill of exceptions.'</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">This evidence was objected to on the ground that the said statement was not legal proof of the existence of a debt by Barrett, did not tend to prove the same, and was not competent evidence thereof, and that the same were fragmentary and incomplete. This evidence was excluded, and the plaintiff excepted to the ruling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">Verdict and judgment having gone for the defendant, the government brought the case here.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\"><i>Messrs. J. M. Carlisle and J. D. McPherson, in support of the ruling below:</i></p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The reports of the auditor and accompanying statements of</i> <i>differences were not admissible in evidence separately from the quarterly returns.</i></p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">Not everything which a treasury officer chooses to write upon the books of the treasury thereby becomes evidence under the act of March 3d, 1797. Those matters of which the treasury officers have official knowledge, and which upon such knowledge they have recorded in the books of the treasury, thereby become evidence. But when those officers ascertain facts by evidence, that evidence becomes part of their proceedings, and their conclusions, apart from the evidence upon which they are founded, are not evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">In the present case the auditor's reports contained debits of large sums received as duties upon imports by the collector at New Orleans&#8212;a matter of which the auditor had no official knowledge and although annexed to the transcript containing those reports there were copies of the returns containing the evidence on which those debits were entered against the collector, the attorney for the plaintiff sought to introduce the auditor's reports without the said returns. When, for instance, the auditor, in settlement No. 5688, certified that he had examined the accounts of Thomas Barrett, collector, &amp;c., and found he was chargeable with $168,645.76 duties on merchandise to September 30, and with $2502.24 'duties on railroad iron imported in 1836, but such duties not credited by the collector at that time,' the accounts so examined, as well as the result of the examination, were part of the proceedings. The report of the auditor purports to find its facts in the accounts rendered by Barrett, and had it been admitted in evidence the defendant would have been put to proof that the duties accrued in 1836 had not been received by him within the period covered by the bond. Whereas, had the accounts themselves been put in evidence as part of the proceedings, it would have been found that no such amount was acknowledged therein, and that the 'finding' of the first auditor was without any evidence to support it.</p>\n<p class=\"indent\">With each report of the auditor is a 'statement of differences,' purporting to show in what particulars the amount stated by the auditor differs from that rendered by the collector. It begins by setting down 'the balance due the United States per his account ending' at such date, and this balance is increased by the addition of such sums as the collector has taken credit for, but which the auditor has refused to allow. It is only by comparing this statement with the original account rendered that the matters of difference between the parties can be understood. And any paper which was passed upon by the auditor and is necessary to a correct understanding of the action of the auditor, is a part of the proceedings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">For example: In the report already cited, No. 5688, the collector is credited with contingent expenses $783.46,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and in the statement of differences it is stated that $3239.13<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> have been disallowed, thus accounting for $4022.59 as if it were the whole amount charged by the collector; but on looking at his account (on page 204), it is seen that he has charged for contingent expenses $4394.65, and the auditor has thus failed to consider and pass upon ($4394.65 less $4122.59) $372.06, either by allowance or disallowance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">This example, taken from the bill of exceptions, was brought to the notice of the court when the transcript was excluded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The quarterly returns were not admissible in evidence without the auditor's reports</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">The defendant is entitled to the benefit of all credits allowed by the accounting officers. But as credits claimed, if not admitted by the accounting officers, must be proven, then it follows that to admit the quarterly returns without the auditor's reports would be to deny the defendant the benefit of all credits given him at the treasury, and put him to proof of all the credits anew. This would have been a great hardship and one which no court would impose, especially if, as stated in the bill of exceptions, the reports thus omitted contained credits which do not appear in the quarterly returns, but do appear first in the settlements made after the collector's death, and which with other settlements the United States declined to offer with the quarterly returns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">3. <i>But if the plaintiff had offered in evidence the complete transcript of which they offered parts, it would not have been admissible</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">It is on its face fragmentary and imperfect, and it moreover contains items not within the scope of the liability of surety on whose bond the suit was brought. We assume that under the act of 1797, which alone makes such a transcript evidence, the transcript must contain, 1st, all the proceedings; 2d, a decision either of allowance or disallowance of all claims to credit, which have been submitted to the accounting officers; 3d, debits manifestly and clearly not within the scope of the account settled and adjusted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">Now in this case,</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The transcript was incomplete</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">In one of the settlements is a gross amount brought into the account as</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">'Balance of his account of official emoluments from 1st July, 1844, to 12th October, 1845, as per report No. 6771, $16,529.73.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">Such a transcript was rejected in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Paterson</i>.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> A 'balance' implies debits and credits, but the report No. 6771, in which they are contained, is not produced; and the transcript thus on its face is fragmentary and imperfect, and shows that there has been a settlement with the collector which is not contained in the transcript. It is unimportant that the unproduced settlement resulted in a credit. There are debits in it, as appears by the result being a 'balance,' and the mischief is the same whether debits be unjustly charged, or credits be unjustly withheld.</p>\n<p class=\"indent\">2. In the instance cited on p. 209, from report No. 5688, the collector had claimed credit for large disbursements on account of contingent expenses. Portions of these were allowed in gross, and other portions rejected, and still other portions are not specially either allowed or rejected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">The act of 1797 declares that no credit, not allowed by the accounting officer, shall be allowed on the trial, unless it has been presented to the accounting officer, 'and <i>disallowed</i>,' or has not been presented by reason of accident or absence from the United States. It results from this provision that the officer is entitled to the decision of the accounting officers on every item, and this court so ruled in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Jones</i>.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">In these cases where the accounting officers have failed to account for more than a small part of the difference between the amount charged by the collector and that admitted by the auditor, it is manifest that, in order to obtain credit for the part rejected, the defendant must prove the whole, for as he cannot identify the part admitted, if he prove any amount less than the whole, the part already admitted will be deducted from it, and he will lose the balance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">3. There are debits in the transcript not within the scope of the liability sought to be enforced. One is seen in the report No. 5688, where there is a charge of duties on railroad iron imported in 1836, and as we understand the entry, paid in 1836, but 'not credited by the collector at that time.'</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">A transcript containing such an item is not admissible in evidence against a surety on a bond dated in 1844.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. C. H. Hill, Assistant Attorney-General, contra</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice HUNT delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">The act of March 3d, 1797, proceeds upon the theory that the officers of the United States shall make up the account of every revenue officer, that it shall adjust the same on its books, and that the account thus stated and adjusted shall stand as and for the sum for which such officer shall be liable to the government. This no doubt is subject to correction by such competent evidence as may be produced. In other words, the statement is <i>prim a facie</i> evidence only, not absolute and conclusive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">In furtherance of this idea it is the duty of the comptroller at once to institute suit for the recovery of the balance thus found and stated. A second result, and one indispensable to the existence of the theory, is, that the books shall be evidence of the truth of the amounts thus stated and declared to be due to the United States. The act, therefore, provides that a transcript from these books and proceedings shall be admitted in evidence, and that, thereupon, the court is authorized to proceed to judgment and execution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">In the present case 'copies of the report of the first auditor,' numbered respectively 5688, &amp;c., and eight in number, were offered in evidence. The bill of exceptions states that no objection was made to the manner in which they were certified.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">The suggestion that the act is applicable to a defaulting principal, and not a surety, is not pressed and need not be considered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">The objection that the reports were fragmentary and incomplete is not sustained by the facts. As presented in the record each report is complete and perfect in itself. Each report contains all upon the subject during the time that it purports to represent. In the aggregate they cover the whole period of Barrett's service. The statute says that a transcript <i>from</i> the books shall be admitted as evidence. A transcript or a transcribing is substantially a copy. A copy from the books, and not of the books, shall be admissible in evidence. An extract from the books, a portion of the books, when authenticated to be a copy, may be given in evidence. While a garbled statement is not evidence, or a mutilated statement, wherein the debits shall be presented and the credits suppressed, or perhaps a statement of results only, it still seems to be clear that it is not necessary that every account with an individual, and all of every account, shall be transcribed as a condition of the admissibility of any one account. The statement presented should be complete in itself, perfect for what it purports to represent, and give both sides of the account as the same stands upon the books.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">Nor is the objection that the reports charge Barrett with gross sums and with balances without giving details, sustained by the facts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">The reports are made up with much particularity, and give the items on each side of the account. It is not a case of a certificate of balances merely. We are not authorized, however, to regulate the manner in which the departments shall keep their books, or to prescribe the minuteness of the detail. The items in these reports are manifestly made up from statements and details of the daily business furnished by the collector. They are necessarily condensed when carried to a ledger account, and the results of many items or of some considerable period of time, may be stated in a briefer from than they stood upon the original entries. The means of particular information are open to either party. We see no objection on this ground to the evidence now presented, and are of the opinion that there was error in its exclusion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">There was error also in excluding the evidence of the accounts rendered by Barrett, the principal. They seem to be complete, not partial or fragmentary as alleged, and being statements made by him to the government in the performance of his official duty, they are evidence against the party making them not only, but his sureties as well, and against third persons in privity with him. The authorities place the rule upon the ground 1st, that the entries made are against the interest of the party making them; and 2dly, that a surety is bound by the acts and declarations of his principal, being within the scope of the business, as a part of the <i>res gestae</i>.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"indent\">JUDGMENT REVERSED, AND A NEW TRIAL ORDERED.</p>\n\n<small>\n</small><p><sup>1</sup> 1 Stat. at Large, 512.</p>\n<p><sup>*</sup>64 17\n \n                                      376 37<sup>*</sup>386 67\n \n    amount of warrant No. 3152, in favor of the treasurer, dated\n September 30th, \n \n     1844,...........................83,164 68\n \n    commission on  $127,805.82 [<sup>*</sup>$127,816.22] at one per cent.,\n    ......................  1,278 06<sup>*</sup>1,278 16\n \n    balance due the United States, . . 43,662 56\n \n                                      *\n \n                                     $172,802 12\n \n      'TREASURY DEPARTMENT,\n \n      FIRST AUDITOR'S OFFICE, June 19th, 1845.\n \n  'Examined and stated by&#8212;&#8212;\n \n      (Signed) 'J.
