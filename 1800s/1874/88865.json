But the petition does not show that the indorsers through whom the plaintiff claims were not citizens of Louisiana at the time the suit was brought.

Two of the bills were indorsed by the payees, and the third by its payee and by other indorsers.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff in his petition described himself as a citizen of Kentucky, and described the defendant as a citizen of Louisiana, but said nothing about the citizenship of the payees of the bills, nor, in the case of that one indorsed by subsequent indorsers, of the citizenship of these.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant pleaded the statute of limitations, general issue, &amp;c.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cause was called for trial, the plaintiff being represented by counsel; but the counsel for the defendant <i>not being present</i>. The cause was submitted for hearing to the court <i>without a jury</i>, and without any written stipulation such as that which, when made in writing and filed with the clerk of the court, the act of March 3d, 1865, allows to have the effect of waiving a jury. The court overruled the plea, determined that the case was made out, and rendered a judgment for the plaintiff for the sum of the three bills, with interest and costs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant now brought the case here for review.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Messrs.
