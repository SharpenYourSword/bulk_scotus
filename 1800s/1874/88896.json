And to secure payment of the note embodying in the lease by which the plantation was let to him a mortgage of all the crops raised on the plantation in the year 1867. The mortgage was immediately recorded in due form. The note was never paid.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the 3d of June, 1867, one Ellett, having recovered a judgment against Sillers, sold the plantation at a sheriff's sale under the judgment, and bought it; and Sillers transferred to him the note of Graham for $3500, due November 1st, 1867, the rent to be paid.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding this, Graham, in November of 1867, transferred the whole crop to certain correspondents of his, Butt &amp; Co., who were heavily in advance for him on then existing transactions. They sold the crop and applied the proceeds in account to the payment of Graham's debt to them.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hereupon Ellett filed a bill in the court below against Butt &amp; Co., to charge them, as trustees for him, with the proceeds of the crop.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence showed&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the one hand, that planting never begins in Mississippi earlier than March; and,</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other,</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That on the 6th of February, 1867, the defendants had seen the lease with the mortgage provision in it, but apparently that they regarded the provision as void. It also showed that on learning that Graham had transferred the crop of 1867 to Butt &amp; Co., Ellett immediately wrote to them, informing them that the lease with the mortgage in it had been at once duly recorded; that, besides, they had express notice of its existence, and that he would hold them accountable as trustees for the proceeds of the crop if they sold it.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below decreed in favor of the complainant, and the defendant brought the case here.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Messrs.

The <i>seed</i> was the essential potential agency to produce cotton. This differs from the existence of a crop of hay, or a fleece of sheep.
