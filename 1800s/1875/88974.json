The declaration contained an averment in substance that the Comptroller of the Currency having become satisfied, 'as specified in the Banking Act,' that the bank had refused to pay its notes, did appoint the plaintiff 'a receiver as provided by the fiftieth section of the act,' and that he had qualified under his appointment and entered upon the performance of his duties. The defendants demurred to the declaration, and, in effect, assigned for cause that it was not specifically averred that each and all of the several things had been done which were provided for in sections forty-six and forty-seven, in order to furnish the evidence to satisfy the comptroller that the bank had refused to pay its notes and was in default. The court below sustained the demurrer and gave judgment for the defendant. The receiver now brought the case here.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. P.

The debtors of a bank, when sued by a receiver, cannot inquire into the legality of his appointment. It is sufficient for the purposes of such a suit that he has been appointed and is receiver in fact.
