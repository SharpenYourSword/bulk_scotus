That company soon afterwards incorporated itself, as railroad companies are allowed in Missouri to do, with another railroad company&#8212;the Iowa Southern&#8212;this last having a paid-up capital of $1,500,000; the two companies forming a third one under a new name, and this new one being, by the terms of consolidation, bound to pay the debts of the old ones. The capital of the new company was to consist of $13,000,000; of which the conjoint $3,500,000 of the two old companies made the part paid in; and there remained, of course, $9,500,000 of stock in the new company to be yet subscribed for.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this condition of things, the State of Missouri, A.D. 1870, amended its constitution. By the amended constitution 'the double liability clause was abrogated,' and the following exactly opposite provision substituted:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Dues from private corporations shall be secured by such means as may be prescribed by law; but in no case shall any stockholder be individually liable in any amount over or above the amount of stock owned by him or her.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>This</i> new provision being in force, a railroad company wholly independent of the others, to wit, the Iowa Railroad Contracting Company, subscribed and paid for eight thousand nine hundred and sixty shares, of the value of $100; in other words, subscribed and paid for stock to the amount of $896,000.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this state of things, Ochiltree's debt not being paid, on execution issued, by any one of the companies, he sued the Iowa Railroad Contracting Company, in one of the State courts of Missouri, as a stockholder in the new company, his suit being founded on the double liability clause of the constitution of 1865, and his assumption being that though the Iowa Railroad Contracting Company had subscribed for its stock after the adoption of the constitution of 1870, yet as his debt accrued <i>before</i> its adoption and while the constitution of 1865 was in force, he could proceed personally against <i>all</i> stockholders, and that 'the single liability' provision in the constitution of 1870 was null and void as to his rights in the case, because, in depriving him of his remedy against stockholders under the law in force when his debts were contracted and the consolidated company became liable therefor, the said provision impaired the obligation of the company's contract with him within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court in which he brought his suit was not of this opinion and gave judgment against him, and this judgment being affirmed by the Supreme Court of Missouri he brought the case here.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. G. W. McCrary, for the plaintiff in error</i>, cited numerous cases in this court, but relied specially on <i>Hawthorne</i> v. <i>Calef</i>.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> He cited also the cases of <i>McLaren</i> v. <i>Franciscus</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and <i>Miller</i> v. <i>Republic Insurance Company</i>.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. T.

His remedy under the law as it existed at the date of his contract is not impaired because the consolidated company increased its stock, as it was authorized to do, and was enabled to sell it by reason of the withdrawal of the burden of personal liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is claimed by the plaintiff that the law under which his debt was contracted made all who were stockholders on the issue of the execution liable to contribute personally to the payment of his debt, and two cases in Missouri are cited to support this proposition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> These cases arose before the repeal of the law, and were controversies between the holders of stock when the debt was contracted and the actual holders of it at the date of the execution. It was conceded that one class or the other were liable, and the court decided that the liability attached to the stock, and followed it in the hands of the assignee, and that, therefore, those stockholders only were liable who were such at the date of the execution. This is the full force of the decisions referred to, and they give to the plaintiff the right to seek his remedy against any one who held stock subject to the incident of individual liability, at the date of the execution against the corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But as the incident of individual liability has been repealed, and neither the law nor his contract makes the defendant liable for the debts of the company beyond the amount of its stock, it follows that the decisions of the Supreme Court of Missouri on the point invoked are not applicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And so, doubtless, thought that court in its decision of this case, as the point is not noticed in the opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 2 Wallace, 10.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> 43 Missouri, 452.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> 50 Id. 55.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> McLaren <i>v.</i> Franciscus, 43 Missouri, 452; Miller <i>v.</i> Republic Insurance Co., 50 Id. 50.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
