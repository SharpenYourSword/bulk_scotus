The object of the bill was to contest the validity of these liens, and to have a sale of the land discharged of the claims asserted by the defendants. A subpoena issued on the bill and was served on all the defendants. They appeared, demurred, and answered in regular course of chancery procedure. Testimony was taken and a final decree rendered in the District Court declaring all the claims of the defendants void as liens on the land. This decree was filed in the court on the 21st day of June, 1871, though dated on the first day of that month. The record showed notices of appeal addressed to the clerk of the District Court by the counsel for Wood and by the counsel for Whitfield, both of which were dated and filed in the District Court on the said 21st of June; the day the decree was filed. But no notice of this appeal was given to Bailey the assignee, until October 28th, 1871.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon motion of the appellee this appeal was dismissed in the Circuit Court for want of notice in time to the assignee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question now was whether it was rightly dismissed for such cause.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The eighth section of the Bankrupt Act which provides for this class of appeals declares that&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'No appeal shall be allowed in any case from the District to the Circuit Court unless it is claimed and notice given thereof to the clerk of the District Court, to be entered with the record of the proceedings, and also to the assignee or creditor, as the case may be, or to the defeated [<i>sic</i>] party in equity, <i>within ten days after the entry of the decree or decision appealed from</i>.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. T.
