Where the amount in dispute, exclusive of costs, exceeds $500, and when the suit is <i>against an alien</i>, or is <i>by a citizen of the State where it is brought, and against a citizen of</i> <i>another State</i>, it may be removed on the petition of the defendant filed in the case, in the State court, at the time of entering his appearance in said court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Second</i>. When the suit is <i>against an alien, and a citizen of the State wherein it is brought</i>, or is <i>by a citizen of such State</i> against a citizen of the same, <i>and a citizen of another State</i>, upon petition of the defendant, filed at any time before trial or final hearing, if (so far as relates to him) it is brought for the purpose of restraining or enjoining him, or is a suit in which there can be a final termination of the controversy, so far as concerns him, without the presence of the other defendants, as parties in said cause.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Third</i>. When a suit is between <i>a citizen of the State in which it is brought and a citizen of another State</i>, it may be so removed on the petition of the latter, whether he be plaintiff or defendant, filed at any time before the trial or final hearing of the suit, if before or at the time of filing said petition he makes and files in said State court an affidavit, stating that he has reason to and does believe that, from prejudice or local influence, he will not be able to obtain justice in such State court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To effect a removal in any of the cases the petitioner must, at the time of filing his petition in the State court, offer to the State court 'good and sufficient security for his entering in said Circuit Court on the first day of its session copies of said process against him, and of all pleadings, <i>depositions, and testimony, and other proceedings in the case</i>, or in said cases, where a citizen of the State where the suit is brought is a defendant, copies of all process, pleadings, <i>depositions, testimony, and other proceedings</i> in the cause <i>concerning or affecting the petitioner</i>,' &amp;c.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These different statutes being in force, and the only ones on the subject, the record in the present case came here.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It showed that Ramsey originally commenced an action against the Pittsburg, Cincinnati, and St. Louis Railway Company in the Superior Court of the City of Chicago; that the suit was afterwards transferred, <i>according to the statutes in such case provided</i>, to the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District of Illinois; that while it was pending in that court undetermined the files and pleadings were all destroyed by fire; that after the fire the plaintiff asked leave to file a declaration as a substitute for the one destroyed; that the defendant assented to this request, and on the same day the court made an order, as follows:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'By agreement of the parties, by their attorneys, as per stipulation filed, leave is given them to file a copy of the declaration and plea heretofore filed herein and destroyed by fire on the 9th of October last, and it is ordered that they be substituted for and stand in the place of the original declaration and plea so destroyed.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That thereupon copies of such pleadings were filed, but that <i>there was nothing in the declaration or plea to show the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court;</i> that on the 11th June, 1872, the parties went to trial upon the issues joined, and that a verdict was rendered for the plaintiff on the 14th of the same month; that on the same day the defendant filed a motion for a new trial, and on the 29th a further motion in arrest of judgment, for the reason that there was nothing upon the record to show that the court had jurisdiction, and that on the 29th of December following the court overruled both motions and gave judgment upon the verdict.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It nowhere appeared that either of the parties attempted to supply any of the lost files except the pleadings, or that any objection was made to the jurisdiction until after the trial was had and a verdict rendered.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The action of the court in overruling the motion in arrest of judgment was the only matter now assigned for error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Messrs. E. Walker and R. B. Roberts, for the plaintiff in error:</i>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There nowhere appears on this record any averment of the citizenship of the plaintiff, nor is any allusion made even to his residence.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As early as <i>Bingham</i> v. <i>Cabot</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and the short cases of <i>Abercrombie</i> v. <i>Dupuis</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and <i>Wood</i> v. <i>Wagnon</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> the necessity of averment of citizenship, as an indispensable prerequisite to the maintenance of jurisdiction, was announced, and Marshall, C. J., in <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Keene</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The decisions of this court require that the averment of jurisdiction shall be positive; <i>that the declaration shall state expressly</i> the fact on which jurisdiction depends. It is not sufficient that the jurisdiction may be <i>inferred</i> argumentatively from the averments.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Jackson</i> v. <i>Ashton</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and in <i>Piquignot</i> v. <i>The Pennsylvania Railroad Company</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> the court declined to examine any questions till the jurisdiction was shown in the pleadings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the later case of <i>The Lucy</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> the court uses this language:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'No consent of counsel can give jurisdiction. Appellate jurisdiction depends on the Constitution and the acts of Congress. When these do not confer it courts of the United States cannot exercise it.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case now before the court, the consent to file a declaration could not, under the authorities which we have cited, either confer citizenship on the plaintiff or jurisdiction on the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Messrs.

But the same thing is not true in a case removed from a State court. The declaration there never, or at least very rarely, states the citizenship of either party. Any statement of it would, in most cases, be surplusage, and irrelative to both the jurisdiction and the controversy. Citizenship, therefore, in a case originally brought in a State court can be shown, on a removal, by affidavit. Indeed if it could not be thus shown, the statutes, so far as they authorize removal on the application of a defendant would be a dead letter. <i>He</i> has nothing to do with the declaration in the case, and can put no averments of any sort into it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only question, therefore, now before the court is whether, when the case shows that the statutes authorizing removal require a difference of citizenship, and when it further shows that the case was removed according to the statutes in cases of removal provided, and when it further appears that all the original papers in the case have been burned,&#8212;the question, we say, is whether the court will, in such a case, presume that there was proper evidence before the court to justify a removal. That it will we can hardly doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In cases where the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States depends upon the character of the parties, as it no doubt does in this, the facts upon which it rests must, of course, somewhere appear in the record. They need not necessarily, however, be averred in the pleadings. It is sufficient if they are in some form affirmatively shown by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the parties have, by stipulation and agreement placed on file and made part of the record, admitted that the cause was brought to the Circuit Court by transfer from a State court in accordance with the statutes in such case provided. By the same stipulation it is made to appear that all the original files in the cause had been destroyed by fire.

This record has never been lost. It was not made until after the fire. The litigation was pending when that calamity occurred. What has been lost is part of the files which, when the time arrived to make up a record, would have been incorporated into it. What we have to consider is whether in the record as made their loss has been supplied. We think it has by the recorded acts of the parties and their stipulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> See the statutes embodied in section 630 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, 873, 874, title 13, chapter 7.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> 3 Dallas, 382.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> 1 Cranch, 343.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> 2 Id. 9.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> 8 Peters, 112.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Id. 148.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> 16 Howard, 105.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> 8 Wallace, 307; and see The Nonesuch, 9 Id. 504; and Pennsylvania <i>v.</i> Quicksilver Co., 10 Id. 553.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
