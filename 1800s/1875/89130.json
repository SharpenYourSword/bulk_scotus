A trial was had, and the court found as facts that the claimant was the owner of the number of bales stated, that they had been captured by the United States military forces at Wilmington, North Carolina, in February, 1865; that they had been turned over to the Treasury agent at Wilmington, and sold in New York, in August, 1865; and that the net proceeds thereof were in the treasury.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But it refused to find as another fact that which the plaintiff requested it to find, namely, 'that the whole amount of net proceeds of the said bales was $17,386.20.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment was rendered against the plaintiff, who thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause for further proceedings, 'in conformity with law and justice.'

The court, however, refused to so proceed, and on the contrary, on the 5th of April, 1875, ordered that all the findings of fact originally made and filed, and upon which the case had been heard in the Supreme Court, should be set aside and held for naught, and that a trial be had <i>de novo</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Thomas Wilson, for the plaintiff</i>, now filed a petition in this court, setting forth these facts and praying that the judges of the Court of Claims show cause why a mandamus should not be issued to the said court, to compel it to vacate its said order of April 5th, 1875, and it proceed in obedience to the mandate of this court, and in conformity to law and justice in the case.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judges of the Court of Claims showed for cause&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1st.

But for this finding as to ownership, seizure, sale, and proceeds in the treasury, the judgment would not have been reversed.
