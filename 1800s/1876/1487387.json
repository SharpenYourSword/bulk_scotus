United States notes are exempt from taxation by or under state or municipal authority; but a court of equity will not knowingly use its extraordinary powers to promote any such scheme as this plaintiff devised to escape his proportionate share of the burdens of taxation. His remedy, if he has any, is in a court of law.</p>\n<p>The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "", "id": 1487387, "judges": "Waite", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/1487387/", "sha1": "5f8b229a856555c035c587119669857fb144b968", "source": "L", "time_retrieved": "2013-10-29T23:27:25.252759"}
