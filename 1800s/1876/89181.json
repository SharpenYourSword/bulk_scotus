F. Clarke, Assistant Commissary-General of Subsistence in the Military Division of the Missouri; which instructions, in connection with the matter of furnishing said cattle, contained the following words:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The cattle should be by contract, if possible,&#8212;delivered by the contractors monthly or weekly, and, when received, actually weighed upon the scales, to be transferred to the agents on foot; the Indians to have the benefit of the fifth quarter extra. The hides to be preserved and saved for sale when practicable.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agents here referred to were officers of the army, appointed to act as Indian agents at the several places where subsistence-supplies were to be issued to the Indians.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">General M. R. Morgan, Chief Commissary of Subsistence of the Military Department of the Missouri, stationed at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., was charged with the supervision of the subsistence of the Indians on the Southern Reservation, which included those to be supplied from Camp Supply and Fort Sill; and the aforesaid instructions to General Clarke were transmitted to him for his guidance.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Supposing himself thereto authorized by the above-quoted words of said instructions, the said Morgan entered into the two written contracts with the claimant sued on, and which are in the words following, to wit:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'<i>Articles of agreement between Bt.

Said agents were not sent to those points by order of General Morgan, nor did they in any way represent him or any other officer of the United States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon these facts, the conclusion of law was that the claimant was not entitled to any recovery, because there had been no breach of the contract by the defendants.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. C. F. Peck</i> for the appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The condition precedent brought forward to defeat this contract most strongly establishes its validity. The agents of the government prevented the Superintendent of Indian Affairs from making a decision by removing all opportunity and ground for it, and then object that the case must fail because such decision was not made. The rule of law in such a case is well settled.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It will always excuse the performance of a condition precedent when it was hindered or prevented by the other party.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No party can insist upon a condition precedent when its non-performance has been caused by himself. <i>Williams</i> v. <i>The Bank of the U.

Smith</i> for the United States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the Superintendent of Indian Affairs as to the number of hides required for the comfort of the Indians was a condition precedent to the claimants becoming entitled to any hides.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It makes no difference whether that official never made any decision, or decided that all the hides were required by the Indians: in either case, the claimant cannot recover. <i>Thurnell</i> v. <i>Balbirnie</i>, 2 M. &amp; W. 786, 790; <i>Worsley</i> v. <i>Wood</i>, 6 T.

R. 384; <i>Moakley</i> v. <i>Riggs</i>, 19 Johns. 69; <i>Taylor</i> v. <i>Bullen</i>, 6 Cow. 629.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contract was subject to the superintendent's arbitration. If he declined to arbitrate, or decided adversely to the claimant's having any hides, the result would be the same. In either contingency, the contract was at end. Cases cited <i>supra; Palmer</i> v. <i>Clark</i>, 106 Mass. 389; <i>Flint</i> v. <i>Gibson</i>, id. 391; <i>Grafton</i> v. <i>Eastern Cos.</i>, 8 Exch. 699.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The number of hides referred to in the contracts was not a guaranteed number, for the reason that the determination of the question as to how many the Indians would require could be arrived at only by the decision of the Superintendent of Indian Affairs.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree entirely with the Court of Claims in its construction of the contracts sued upon in this case. By one contract, Lobenstein was to have 'all the hides of beef-cattle slaughtered <i>for</i> Indians at Camp Supply, . . . up to and including June 30, 1870, which the Superintendent of Indian Affairs at that place shall decide are not required for the comfort of the Indians; the number of hides to be about 2,000, more or less.' The other contract is similar in its terms for the hides of cattle slaughtered <i>for</i> Indians at Fort Sill, the number to be about 4,000, more or less.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner of Indian Affairs directed that all the cattle should be turned over to the Indian agent on foot; and this was done. None were slaughtered by any person acting under the authority of the United States; but they were all given out from time to time to the Indians, by whom they were killed. Consequently, no hides could be delivered under the contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no obligation on the part of the United States to slaughter the cattle or any portion of them for the Indians; and they were only bound to deliver the hides of such as they did slaughter, in case the Superintendent of Indian Affairs did not decide that they were required for the comfort of the Indians. If he decided that all were required by the Indians, that excused the United States from delivery to Lobenstein. He did, in effect, so decide when the Commissioner directed that the cattle should all be delivered on foot. Lobenstein took this risk when he entered into the contracts, and he undoubtedly made his calculations of profits in case of success accordingly. The best evidence of this is to be found in the fact that he claims in this action to recover more than $15,000 for alleged loss of profits, while he has actually expended in preparation to meet his obligations only $1,256.75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The estimate of the number of hides as made in the contracts does not create an obligation on the part of the United States to deliver that number. That estimate was undoubtedly intended as a representation of the probable number of cattle that would be delivered to the Indians. In point of fact, the number actually delivered was very much less. Neither party could determine how many would be reserved by the Commissioner for the use of the Indians. Therefore, necessarily, when the contract was made, the number specified could not have been understood to be a guaranteed number. If that number or its approximation was not guaranteed, none was. It follows as a consequence that this claimant has no right of action. He took his risk, and insured himself in his anticipated large profits if his venture proved a success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The judgment of the Court of Claims is affirmed</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

If he declined to arbitrate, or decided adversely to the claimant's having any hides, the result would be the same. In either contingency, the contract was at end.

CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree entirely with the Court of Claims in its construction of the contracts sued upon in this case. By one contract, Lobenstein was to have 'all the hides of beef-cattle slaughtered <i>for</i> Indians at Camp Supply, . . . up to and including June 30, 1870, which the Superintendent of Indian Affairs at that place shall decide are not required for the comfort of the Indians; the number of hides to be about 2,000, more or less.' The other contract is similar in its terms for the hides of cattle slaughtered <i>for</i> Indians at Fort Sill, the number to be about 4,000, more or less.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner of Indian Affairs directed that all the cattle should be turned over to the Indian agent on foot; and this was done. None were slaughtered by any person acting under the authority of the United States; but they were all given out from time to time to the Indians, by whom they were killed. Consequently, no hides could be delivered under the contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no obligation on the part of the United States to slaughter the cattle or any portion of them for the Indians; and they were only bound to deliver the hides of such as they did slaughter, in case the Superintendent of Indian Affairs did not decide that they were required for the comfort of the Indians. If he decided that all were required by the Indians, that excused the United States from delivery to Lobenstein. He did, in effect, so decide when the Commissioner directed that the cattle should all be delivered on foot. Lobenstein took this risk when he entered into the contracts, and he undoubtedly made his calculations of profits in case of success accordingly. The best evidence of this is to be found in the fact that he claims in this action to recover more than $15,000 for alleged loss of profits, while he has actually expended in preparation to meet his obligations only $1,256.75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The estimate of the number of hides as made in the contracts does not create an obligation on the part of the United States to deliver that number. That estimate was undoubtedly intended as a representation of the probable number of cattle that would be delivered to the Indians. In point of fact, the number actually delivered was very much less. Neither party could determine how many would be reserved by the Commissioner for the use of the Indians. Therefore, necessarily, when the contract was made, the number specified could not have been understood to be a guaranteed number. If that number or its approximation was not guaranteed, none was. It follows as a consequence that this claimant has no right of action. He took his risk, and insured himself in his anticipated large profits if his venture proved a success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The judgment of the Court of Claims is affirmed</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
