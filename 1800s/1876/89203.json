The Supreme Court decided that the defence set forth in the peremptory exception was not good; and that is all that court decided. The case was, therefore, sent back for trial upon the defences set up in the answer, or any other that might be properly presented. If the decision below upon the exception had been correct, such a trial would have been unnecessary. The Supreme Court having decided that it was not correct, the inferior court must now proceed further.
