The distance was stated to be fourteen hundred miles. The duty was required to be performed each way once in each month, in safe and suitable steamboats, by the way of Port Townsend and San Juan.

Each terminus was given, \u0097 to wit, Port Townsend and Sitka, \u0097 as was the route to be followed, \u0097 to wit, by way of San Juan, \u0097 and the length of time to be occupied, \u0097 to wit, ten days for the whole distance, of which this distance bore the proportion of nine to fourteen, \u0097 and the time of making up and delivery, upon the same principle. The steamer should leave Portland on the first day of every month; of the ten days allowed for the passage to Sitka, five-fourteenths would be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*246</span> occupied in reaching Port Townsend, and nine-fourteenths would be allowed for the residue. The whole time and the whole number of miles being given, it was a simple arithmetical question of when the steamer would leave Port Townsend, and when, on its return, it would reach that port.</p>\n<p>The object of the statute was to secure notice of the intended post-routes, of the service required, and the manner of its performance, that bidders might compete, that favoritism should be prevented, that efficiency and economy in the service should be obtained. It was not required that papers of this character should be drawn, as if they were subject to the criticism or dissection of a demurrer in a court of law.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, it appears that this notice for the abridged distance is in conformity to the usages of the Post-Office Department for many years past, proof having been made of nine hundred similar advertisements published by the Postmaster-General.
