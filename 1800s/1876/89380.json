This petition presenting for consideration, in the opinion of the District Court, difficult and important questions, the cause was reserved, in accordance with the practice in Ohio, to the Supreme Court 'for its decision on said petition for the removal of the cause to the Circuit Court.' The Supreme Court, after hearing, dismissed the petition and remanded the cause to the District Court 'for further proceedings according to law.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To reverse this judgment the present writ of error was brought.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Submitted on printed arguments by <i>Mr. H.

The suit is still pending in the District Court, and it is not impossible that the parties now complaining may be satisfied with the judgment which they may in the end be able to secure in the State courts. If not, after a final judgment has in fact been rendered by the highest court of the State in which a decision in the suit can be had, the case may be again brought here for a determination of the questions arising upon the petition for removal.
