In the Circuit Court he amended his bill, setting forth in detail the particulars of his claim to the benefit of the act of Congress through the city ordinances. To this amended bill the city demurred, assigning for cause, among others, that it did not show that the Circuit Court had jurisdiction. Upon the hearing of this demurrer, the court entered an order remanding the cause to the State court, and from that order the present appeal has been taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By sect. 5 of the act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 471, it is provided 'that the order of the Circuit Court dismissing or remanding the cause shall be reviewable by the Supreme Court on writ of error or appeal, as the case may be.' This is a modification of the previous legislation upon this subject, under which we held, in <i>Insurance Company</i> v. <i>Comstock</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></span>, and <i>Railroad Company</i> v. <i>Wiswall</i>, 23 id. 508, 'that the remedy in such a case was by <i>mandamus</i> to compel action, and not by writ of error to review what has been done.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have, therefore, jurisdiction of this appeal, but we are clearly of the opinion that the Circuit Court did not err in remanding the cause. The questions involved did not arise under the laws of the United States, but under the ordinances of the city as ratified by the act of the legislature. The act of Congress operated as a release to the city of all the interest on the United States in the land. The title of the United States was vested in the city. Whether the city took the beneficial interest in the property as well as the legal title depended upon the effect to be given to the act of the legislature and the ordinances, and not upon the act of Congress. The case is precisely the same in principle as it would have been if the city had, previous to the act of Congress, conveyed the land to Hoadley by deed, with covenants of warranty. If in such a case a controversy should arise between Hoadley and the city as to whether or not the title granted to the city inured to his benefit under the warranty, the question would not be as to the effect of the grant from the United States, but as to that of the conveyance from the city. The case would not arise under the laws of the United States, but under the deed and its covenants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Decree affirmed</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
