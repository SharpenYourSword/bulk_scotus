The same rule provides, par. 3, that upon the filing of the transcript the appearance of counsel for appellant shall be entered. This was promulgated at the December Term, 1867, and has been in force since that time. 6 Wall. v. As early as the February Term, 1808, it was 'ordered that all parties in this court, not being residents of the United States, shall give security for the costs accruing in this court, to be entered on record,' 4 Cranch, 537; but at the January Term, 1831, this was amended so as to read as follows: 'In all cases the clerk shall take of the plaintiff a bond with competent security, to respond to the costs, in the penalty of $200, or a deposit of that amount to be placed in bank subject to his draft.' 5 Pet. 724. This last order was continued in force substantially as originally promulgated until May 8, 1876, during the last term, when it was amended so as to read as follows: 'In all cases the plaintiff in error or appellant (on docketing a cause and filing the record) shall enter into an undertaking to the clerk, with security to his satisfaction, for the payment of his fees, or otherwise satisfy him in that behalf.' 91 U.

At the January Term, 1836, the defendant in error moved that the cause be docketed and dismissed, and the plaintiff in error, that the transcript be filed and the cause docketed without the bond. The motion of the plaintiff in error was overruled, but leave was given him to docket the cause upon giving the bond; and it was ordered that if this was not done by March 1, the motion of the defendant in error to docket and dismiss be granted.

No heed was given to this suggestion; and three months afterwards, Feb. 24, 1876, a motion to docket and dismiss was made and granted.
