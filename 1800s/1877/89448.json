Evarts, Mr. C.B. Lawrence, Mr. B.C. Cook, Mr. John W. Cary, and Mr. E.W. Stoughton, for the appellants.</p>\n<p>Mr. I.C. Sloan and Mr. L.S. Dixon, contra.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*175</span> MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>These suits present the single question of the power of the legislature of Wisconsin to provide by law for a maximum of charge to be made by the Chicago and North-western Railway Company for fare and freight upon the transportation of persons and property carried within the State, or taken up outside the State and brought within it, or taken up inside and carried without. That company was by its charter authorized \"to demand and receive such sum or sums of money for the transportation of persons and property, and for storage of property, as it shall deem reasonable.\" Charter of the Wisconsin &amp; Superior Railroad Co., sect. 6. Other forms of expression are used in charters granted by Wisconsin to other companies, which by consolidation have become merged in the present corporation; but they are all the same in effect. None go beyond this.</p>\n<p>The Constitution of the State in force when each of the several acts of incorporation was passed, provides that all acts for the creation of corporations within the State \"may be altered or repealed by the legislature at any time after their passage.\" Art. 11, sect. 1.</p>\n<p>It was conceded upon the argument that this reserved power of the Constitution gave the legislature \"the same power over the business and property of corporations that it has over individuals,\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*176</span> or, as it is expressed by one of the counsel, \"nothing more could have been intended than to leave the stockholders in corporations in such a position that the legislature could place them on the same footing with natural persons before the law, and disable them from permanently evading the burdens on all others engaged in similar vocations, by appealing to the letter of their charter. Their object was not to open the door to oppression, but to secure simple equality between citizens of the State, whether working singly or in corporate associations.\" And, in another place, the same learned counsel says: \"The privilege, then, of charging whatever rates it may deem proper is a franchise, which may be taken away under the reserved power, but the right to charge a reasonable compensation would remain as a right under the general law governing natural persons, and not as a special franchise or privilege.\"</p>\n<p>Without stopping to inquire whether this is the extent of the operation of this important constitutional reservation, it is sufficient to say that it does, without any doubt, have that effect. In Munn v. Illinois, supra, p. 113, and Chicago, Burlington, &amp; Quincy Railroad Co. v. Iowa, supra, p. 155, we decided that the State may limit the amount of charges by railroad companies for fares and freights, unless restrained by some contract in the charter, even though their income may have been pledged as security for the payment of obligations incurred upon the faith of the charter. So far this case is disposed of by those decisions.</p>\n<p>It remains only to consider a few questions raised here which were not involved in the cases that have already been decided.</p>\n<p>1. As to the consolidation of the Wisconsin corporations with those of Illinois. For the purpose of promoting this consolidation, the legislature of Wisconsin passed an enabling act, and, in so doing, provided that if such consolidation was perfected, \"the consolidated company shall be and remain subject to the laws of the State of Wisconsin and the State of Illinois, respectively, and shall have in all respects the same privileges as though this consolidation had not taken place; provided, that the laws of Illinois shall have no force and effect in the State of Wisconsin.\" Wisconsin Consolidation Act, March 10, 1855, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*177</span> sect. 8. The second section of the same act also provided that the consolidated company should \"have all the rights, privileges, and franchises conferred on the said companies [those in Illinois as well as those in Wisconsin] by the laws of the States of Illinois and Wisconsin, respectively, the same, and not otherwise, as though the said consolidation had not taken place.\" In this way, Wisconsin in effect said to the Illinois companies, \"You may consolidate your interest with those of the named companies in this State, and form one corporation in the two States; but, in so doing, you must, in Wisconsin, be subject to our laws. In Wisconsin, all corporations are liable to have their charters altered or repealed at the will of the legislature. If you are willing to take this risk, we will care for you, within our jurisdiction, precisely as we do for our own corporations.\"</p>\n<p>Upon these terms the consolidation was finally perfected, and the consolidated company now exists under the two jurisdictions, but subject to the same legislative control as to its business in Wisconsin as private persons. The Illinois companies might have stayed out. But they chose to come in, and must now abide the consequences. Thus Wisconsin is permitted to legislate for the consolidated company in that State precisely the same as it would for its own original companies, if no consolidation had taken place. This is the contract by which the Illinois stockholders must abide. Haying availed themselves of what they supposed to be the advantages of the consolidation, they cannot repudiate their corresponding obligations.</p>\n<p>There is nothing, therefore, in this objection.</p>\n<p>2. The obligations of the consolidated company, under the land grant to the Wisconsin and Superior Railroad Company, to keep that part of its road which formerly belonged to that company open as a public highway for the use of the government of the United States, free from toll or other charges upon the transportation of property or troops of the United States, and to transport the mails at such prices as Congress may by law direct. The United States do not complain. It will be time enough for us to consider this objection when they do.</p>\n<p>3. As to the effect of the statute as a regulation of inter-state commerce. The law is confined to State commerce, or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*178</span> such inter-state commerce as directly affects the people of Wisconsin. Until Congress acts in reference to the relations of this company to inter-state commerce, it is certainly within the power of Wisconsin to regulate its fares, &amp;c., so far as they are of domestic concern. With the people of Wisconsin this company has domestic relations. Incidentally, these may reach beyond the State. But certainly, until Congress undertakes to legislate for those who are without the State, Wisconsin may provide for those within, even though it may indirectly affect those without.</p>\n<p>4. As to the repeal of this act by that of March 12, 1874. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin has decided that there is no such repeal as is claimed. The Atty.-Gen. v. Railroad Companies, 35 Wis. 427. This is binding on us.</p>\n<p>5. As to the claim that the courts must decide what is reasonable, and not the legislature. This is not new to this case. It has been fully considered in Munn v. Illinois. Where property has been clothed with a public interest, the legislature may fix a limit to that which shall in law be reasonable for its use. This limit binds the courts as well as the people. If it has been improperly fixed, the legislature, not the courts, must be appealed to for the change.</p>\n<p>6. The sale of the Chicago, St. Paul, and Fond du Lac Rail road Company. The charter of the company whose road was sold does not confer any right which has been impaired by this legislation. That company, like other railroad companies in Wisconsin, was subject to regulation as to its fares, &amp;c. It is, therefore, unnecessary to consider what might under other circumstances have been the effect of such a sale.</p>\n<p>This disposes of the case. No other questions need be considered. If the question ever arises whether the company can be compelled to continue its business at the prices fixed, it will be time enough for us to pass upon it when it reaches here in due course of proceeding. It is not here now.</p>\n<p>Decrees affirmed.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE FIELD and MR. JUSTICE STRONG dissented.</p>\n</div>",

It appoints railroad commissioners, and prescribes their duties and powers. The eighteenth section is in the following words:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Nothing contained in this act shall be taken as in any manner abridging or controlling the rates for freight charged by any railroad company in this State for carrying freight which comes from beyond the boundaries of the State, and to be carried across or through the State; but said railroad companies shall possess the same power and right to charge such rates for carrying such freight as they possessed before the passage of this act.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants in each case demurred to the bill of complaint therein filed. The demurrers were sustained, and the defendants brought the cases here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. W. M. Evarts, Mr. C. B. Lawrence, Mr. B. C. Cook, Mr. John W. Cary</i>, and <i>Mr. E. W. Stoughton</i>, for the appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The act entitled 'An Act relating to railroads, express and telegraph companies, in the State of Wisconsin,' approved March 11, 1874, regarded independently of the clause of the State Constitution, reserving the right to alter or repeal corporate charters, is a clear violation of that provision of the Federal Constitution which forbids a State to pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts. <i>Wilmington Railroad Co.</i> v. <i>Reid</i>, 13 Wall. 266; <i>Pacific Railroad Co.</i> v. <i>McGuire</i>, 20 id. 42; <i>Humphrey</i> v. <i>Pigues</i>, 16 id. 247; <i>Attorney-General</i> v. <i>The Railroad Companies</i>, 35 Wis. 425.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That clause must be construed in connection with another provision in the same instrument, forbidding the taking of private property for public use, except on due compensation, and in subordination to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which ordains that 'no State shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.' No compensation has been tendered, and the act violates that amendment. <i>Wynehamer</i> v. <i>The People</i>, 13 N. Y. 392; <i>Pumpelly</i> v. <i>Green Bay Co.</i>, 13 Wall. 466; <i>Green</i> v. <i>Biddle</i>, 8 Wheat. 355.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So long as the company operates the road, it has the right to demand a reasonable compensation for its services. That right is not a special franchise or privilege, but exists by universal law, and cannot be abridged or impaired. <i>Case of the State Freight Tax</i>, 15 Wall. 233; <i>Miller</i> v. <i>State</i>, 15 id. 478; <i>Holyoke Co.</i> v. <i>Lyman</i>, id. 500; <i>Von Hoffman</i> v. <i>Quincy</i>, 4 id. 535; <i>Curran</i> v. <i>State of Arkansas</i>, 15 How. 304; <i>Beardstown</i> v. <i>Louisville Railroad Co.</i>, 4 Met. (Ky.) 308; <i>Sage</i> v. <i>Dillard</i>, 15 B. Mon. (Ky.) 353; <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Express Company</i>, 13 Gray, 253.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NOTE.&#8212;These cases were elaborately and at great length argued by the respective counsel. It will be impracticable for the reporter to furnish more than a very condensed synopsis of the argument. No attempt will be made to give the particular points which each of the counsel maintained. The argument on each side is given as a whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of what is a reasonable compensation is for judicial determination, and cannot be decided by the legislature. <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Proprietors of Bridge</i>, 2 Gray, 337; <i>Attorney-General</i> v. <i>The Railroad Companies, supra; P. W. &amp; B. Railroad Co.</i> v. <i>Bower</i>, Law Reg., March, 1874; <i>Chicago &amp; Alton Railroad Co.</i> v. <i>The People</i>, 67 Ill. 11; <i>State</i> v. <i>Noyes</i>, 47 Me. 203; <i>Stamford</i> v. <i>Pawlet</i>, 1 Cromp. &amp; J. 57. The State, being a party to the contract, cannot prescribe the compensation by a subsequent enactment which shall bind the other party. Were it otherwise, the will of each succeeding legislature, and not the charter, would determine the powers and rights of the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conceding that the charter which gave the franchise be subject to repeal, the State cannot take from the company its roadbed and its rolling-stock, or the income derived from their use, without making just compensation. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin, in <i>Attorney-General</i> v. <i>The Railroad Companies, supra</i>, in granting an injunction to restrain the company from operating its road except upon the terms prescribed, declares that 'the material property and rights of corporations should be inviolate.' This act, so far from leaving them inviolate, takes the income, and thus as effectually deprives the company of the beneficial use of its property, and the means of performing its engagements with its creditors, as if the road was confiscated. There is no substantial difference between a law which diminishes the income of a company thirty per cent, by reducing its tariff of rates, and one which requires it to pay that per cent to the treasurer of State, and obliges him to distribute it <i>pro rata</i> among those who paid fares or freight to the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all the adjudged cases on the subject the rulings have been uniform, that there are some necessary limits to the exercise of the power which the State assumes to amend or repeal charters, and among them is, that the character of the companies shall not be changed, nor the purposes of their creation defeated, nor vested rights of property impaired. <i>Sage</i> v. <i>Dillard</i>, 15 B. Mon. (Ky.) 353.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'It seems to us,' says the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, in <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Essex Co.</i>, 13 Gray, 253, 'that this power must have some limit, although it is difficult to define it. Perhaps the rule is this, that where, under a power in the charter, rights have been acquired and become vested, no amendment or alteration of the charter can take away the property or rights which have become vested under a legitimate exercise of the powers granted.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tried by this principle, thus explicitly announced, and which is substantially sustained by this court in <i>Holyoke Company</i> v. <i>Lyman</i> and <i>Miller</i> v. <i>State, supra</i>, the act cannot be justified.

The power to alter depends on the meaning of the word 'alter.' To alter is to make different, without destroying identity (Crabb); to vary, without entire change (Webster and Imp. Dict.). A corporate charter of one kind cannot be altered to a charter of an entirely different kind. But a corporate charter may be altered so as to make it different in detail, so long as the general identity of the corporation remains; so that it is varied without entire change. This is the obvious meaning to lawyer or layman. Arguments <i>ab inconvenienti</i> cannot weigh against the manifest meaning of the word used: they may go to impeach the wisdom of the power, but not to impair its import.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this court a similar construction has been given to the same words, and the scope and effect of the reserved power held to be the same, whether it be contained in a special act creating a corporation, or in a general law applicable to all future acts of incorporation, unless specially excepted, or, as in this instance, in the Constitution, under which no unalterable or irrepealable charter can be granted. <i>Sherman</i> v. <i>Smith</i>, 1 Black, 587; <i>Pennsylvania College Cases</i>, 13 Wall. 190; <i>Tomlinson</i> v. <i>Jessup</i>, 15 id. 454; <i>Miller</i> v. <i>State</i>, id. 478; <i>Holyoke Company</i> v. <i>Lyman</i>, id. 500; <i>Olcott</i> v. <i>The Supervisors</i>, 16 id. 678.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Charters are to be construed most favorably to the State, and nothing passes by implication. <i>The Dubuque &amp; Pacific Railroad Co.</i> v. <i>Litchfield</i>, 23 How. 66; <i>The Binghamton Bridge</i>, 3 Wall. 51; <i>Home of the Friendless</i> v. <i>Rouse</i>, id. 430.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The controversy is therefore reduced to the meaning of 'alter.' The remark in <i>Tomlinson</i> v. <i>Jessup, supra</i>, that 'rights acquired by third parties stand upon a different footing,' was obviously not intended to intimate that the legislature, in the exercise of the power conferred by the Constitution, may not, by altering the charter of a company without its consent, operate upon its franchises, whenever the public interests would be thereby subserved, although the effect may be incidentally to diminish its resources for the payment of its debts, or depreciate the value of its stock or its bonds. Such an effect constitutes no valid ground of complaint: if it did, the exercise of the power would be always defeated.

That company was by its charter authorized 'to demand and receive such sum or sums of money for the transportation of persons and property, and for storage of property, as it shall deem reasonable.' Charter of the Wisconsin &amp; Superior Railroad Co., sect. 6.

Their object was not to open the door to oppression, but to secure simple equality between citizens of the State, whether working singly or in corporate associations.' And, in another place, the same learned counsel says: 'The privilege, then, of charging whatever rates it may deem proper is a franchise, which may be taken away under the reserved power, but the right to charge a reasonable compensation would remain as a right under the general law governing natural persons, and not as a special franchise or privilege.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without stopping to inquire whether this is the extent of the operation of this important constitutional reservation, it is sufficient to say that it does, without any doubt, have that effect.

As to the consolidation of the Wisconsin corporations with those of Illinois. For the purpose of promoting this consolidation, the legislature of Wisconsin passed an enabling act, and, in so doing, provided that if such consolidation was perfected, 'the consolidated company shall be and remain subject to the laws of the State of Wisconsin and the State of Illinois, respectively, and shall have in all respects the same privileges as though this consolidation had not taken place; provided, that the laws of Illinois shall have no force and effect in the State of Wisconsin.' Wisconsin Consolidation Act, March 10, 1855, sect. 8. The second section of the same act also provided that the consolidated company should 'have all the rights, privileges, and franchises conferred on the said companies [those in Illinois as well as those in Wisconsin] by the laws of the States of Illinois and Wisconsin, respectively, the same, and not otherwise, as though the said consolidation had not taken place.' In this way, Wisconsin in effect said to the Illinois companies, 'You may consolidate your interest with those of the named companies in this State, and form one corporation in the two States; but, in so doing, you must, in Wisconsin, be subject to our laws. In Wisconsin, all corporations are liable to have their charters altered or repealed at the will of the legislature. If you are willing to take this risk, we will care for you, within our jurisdiction, precisely as we do for our own corporations.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon these terms the consolidation was finally perfected, and the consolidated company now exists under the two jurisdictions, but subject to the same legislative control as to its business in Wisconsin as private persons. The Illinois companies might have stayed out. But they chose to come in, and must now abide the consequences. Thus Wisconsin is permitted to legislate for the consolidated company in that State precisely the same as it would for its own original companies, if no consolidation had taken place. This is the contract by which the Illinois stockholders must abide. Having availed themselves of what they supposed to be the advantages of the consolidation, they cannot repudiate their corresponding obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is nothing, therefore, in this objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The obligations of the consolidated company, under the land grant to the Wisconsin and Superior Railroad Company, to keep that part of its road which formerly belonged to that company open as a public highway for the use of the government of the United States, free from toll or other charges upon the transportation of property or troops of the United States, and to transport the mails at such prices as Congress may by law direct. The United States do not complain. It will be time enough for us to consider this objection when they do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. As to the effect of the statute as a regulation of interstate commerce. The law is confined to State commerce, or such inter-state commerce as directly affects the people of Wisconsin. Until Congress acts in reference to the relations of this company to inter-state commerce, it is certainly within the power of Wisconsin to regulate its fares, &amp;c., so far as they are of domestic concern. With the people of Wisconsin this company has domestic relations. Incidentally, these may reach beyond the State. But certainly, until Congress undertakes to legislate for those who are without the State, Wisconsin may provide for those within, even though it may indirectly affect those without.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. As to the repeal of this act by that of March 12, 1874. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin has decided that there is no such repeal as is claimed. <i>The Atty.-Gen.</i> v. <i>Railroad Companies</i>, 35 Wis. 427. This is binding on us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. As to the claim that the courts must decide what is reasonable, and not the legislature. This is not new to this case. It has been fully considered in <i>Munn</i> v. <i>Illinois</i>. Where property has been clothed with a public interest, the legislature may fix a limit to that which shall in law be reasonable for its use. This limit binds the courts as well as the people. If it has been improperly fixed, the legislature, not the courts, must be appealed to for the change.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. The sale of the Chicago, St. Paul, and Fond du Lac Railroad Company. The charter of the company whose road was sold does not confer any right which has been impaired by this legislation. That company, like other railroad companies in Wisconsin, was subject to regulation as to its fares, &amp;c. It is, therefore, unnecessary to consider what might under other circumstances have been the effect of such a sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This disposes of the case. No other questions need be considered. If the question ever arises whether the company can be compelled to continue its business at the prices fixed, it will be time enough for us to pass upon it when it reaches here in due course of proceeding. It is not here now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Decrees affirmed</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. JUSTICE FIELD and MR. JUSTICE STRONG dissented.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
