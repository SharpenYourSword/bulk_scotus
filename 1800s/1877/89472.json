Pursuant to this demand a trial was had, which resulted in a verdict finding the facts set forth in the petition to be true; and an adjudication was made accordingly. Exceptions were taken at the trial to the rulings of the court upon the admissibility of testimony, and also to the charge.

S. 347, 'that a proceeding in bankruptcy, from its commencement to its close upon the final settlement of the estate, is but one suit. The several motions made and acts done in the bankrupt court in the progress of the cause are not distinct suits at law or in equity, but parts of one suit in bankruptcy, from which they cannot be separated. As our jurisdiction extends only to a re-examination of final judgments or decrees in suits at law or in equity, it follows that we have no control over judgments and orders made by the courts below in mere bankruptcy proceedings.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Going, then, to the bankrupt law, we find, Rev.

And, also, that 'if upon the hearing or trial, the facts set forth in the petition are found to be true, . . . the court shall adjudge the debtor to be a bankrupt.' Sect. 5028. From this it is clear that the trial by jury is as much before the court 'when sitting as a court of bankruptcy,' and as much a part of the suit in bankruptcy, as the summary hearing by the court is when a jury shall not be demanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The supervisory jurisdiction of the Circuit Court extends to all cases and questions arising in the District Court when sitting as a court of bankruptcy, and it follows that our jurisdiction is excluded over all such questions and cases.

If it is not, we have no power of review, because only such judgments of that court can be re-examined h re. Rev. Stat., sect. 691. We think it is not; and, as the general subject has been so recently before us in <i>Wiswall et al.</i> v. <i>Campbell et al., Assignee</i>, we content ourselves with a reference in support of this conclusion to the opinion in that case, following, as it does, that in <i>Sandusky</i> v. <i>National Bank, supra</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Writ of error dismissed for want of jurisdiction</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
