The comptroller of the currency appointed a receiver, and the bank has since been in his hands. The Mechanics' Bank and its assignors had funds on deposit. On the 24th of September, 1873, all the parties demanded payment. Nothing was paid. Instalments on account of the principal debts were subsequently paid from time to time to each of the parties. On the 20th of November, 1874, the last instalment was paid in each case, and the principal debts were thereby extinguished. At each payment, interest from the 24th of September, 1873, on the amount so paid, was demanded and refused. The other parties assigned to the defendant in error their claims respectively for such interest. The Mechanics' Bank instituted this suit. The declaration demands the payment of this interest in all the cases, with interest upon the aggregate amount from the 20th of November, 1874. The Bank of the Commonwealth demurred.

Neither of the parties can make it after a controversy upon the subject has arisen between them, and <i>a fortiori</i> not at the trial. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Kirkpatrick</i>, 9 Wheat. 720; <i>United States</i> v. <i>January</i>, 7 Cranch, 572; <i>Field</i> v. <i>Holland</i>, 6 id. 8.

I don't know of any court in any country (and I have looked into the matter) which don't carry interest down to the last act by which the sum is liquidated.' The treasury authority fell into an error. There should have been no discrimination between principal and interest in making the payments.

The action not being in debt, the same amount was properly included in the mass of the damages for which the judgment was rendered.</p>\n<p>The compounding of interest, so far as it has occurred, was due entirely to the fault of the agent of the plaintiff in error. The principle of estoppel in pais applies. No exception can be taken upon that ground.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff in this action was entitled, ex equo et bono, to the money sought to be recovered. Where the right to recover exists in this class of cases, it includes interest as well as principal, unless there is something which would render the payment of the former inequitable.</p>\n<p>Kent, C.J., said upon this subject: \"Each case will depend upon the justice and equity arising out of its peculiar circumstances, to be disclosed at the trial. Pearce v. Barbour, 3 Caines, 265. See also Robinson v. Bland, 2 Burr. 1087.</p>\n<p>In the latter case, Lord Mansfield said: \"The interest is an accessory to the principal; and the plaintiff cannot bring a new action for any interest grown due between the commencement of his action and the judgment in it... . I don't know of any court in any country (and I have looked into the matter) which don't carry interest down to the last act by which the sum is liquidated.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*441</span> The treasury authority fell into an error. There should have been no discrimination between principal and interest in making the payments. The creditor had the same right with respect to both as if he had been pursuing the defaulting debtor under other circumstances. The Comptroller should have done just what the law would have done if the case had not come under his cognizance.</p>\n<p>Numerous cases, both English and American, are to be found in which compound interest, under special circumstances, was recovered. It is sufficient to refer to a few of them. Ex parte Beavans, 9 Ves. Jr. 223; Coliot v. Walker, 2 Anstr. 495; Hamilton v. Le Grange, 2 H. Black. 145; Kellog v. Hickock, 1 Wend. (N.Y.) 521; Tyler v. Yates, 3 Barb. (N.Y.) 222; Aurora City v. West, 7 Wall. 82; Town of Genoa v. Woodruff et al., 92 U.S. 502.</p>\n<p>The demand for the interest was properly made upon the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p>Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</div>", "id": 89489, "judges": "Swayne", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/89489/", "sha1": "783d3f491a905bf7effe215bbab1b513ceeae743", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:02:06"}
