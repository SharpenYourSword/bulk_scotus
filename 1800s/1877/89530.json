Upon the final hearing below the bill was dismissed, and from that decree this appeal, which operates as a <i>supersedeas</i>, was taken. When the <i>supersedeas</i> was perfected, the receiver had in his hands about $25,000, invested in United States bonds, which he had collected under the order of the court and held subject to its disposal.

To that end, a further order of the court was asked; but such an order would be in aid of the execution of the decree which has been stayed, and consequently beyond the power of the court to make until the appeal is disposed of.

Stat., issue an appropriate writ to restrain that action, for it would be 'a writ necessary for the exercise of our jurisdiction.' The precise form of the writ to be issued, or relief to be granted, must necessarily depend upon the particular circumstances of any case that may arise. In this case, a rule has been already entered and served upon the court below and its receiver, restraining them from paying over any portion of the fund to the defendant until the further order of this court.
