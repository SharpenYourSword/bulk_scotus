Melendy justified as marshal of the United States for the district of Iowa, claiming that he seized the goods as the property of Clark &amp; Freer, bankrupts, under a provisional warrant of seizure issued from the Bankrupt Court after the adjudication in bankruptcy. Rice claimed that he purchased the property from Clark &amp; Freer before their bankruptcy. Melendy insisted that the sale was in fraud of the bankrupt law; and the case turned upon the single question whether Rice, when he purchased, had reasonable cause to believe that Clark &amp; Freer were insolvent. The trial below was by a referee, and he found in favor of Rice. Minutes of the testimony taken by the referee were filed with his report. In accordance with the practice in Iowa, a judgment was entered in vacation by the clerk, such as was recommended by the referee. At the next term, a motion was filed to set aside the report of the referee and vacate the u dgment which had thus been entered, and, among other causes assigned, was one to the effect that the referee erred in finding from the testimony that Rice, when he purchased, did not have reasonable cause to believe that Clark &amp; Freer were insolvent. This motion was overruled, and the judgment affirmed as entered.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this judgment of the District Court an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of the State, where the same finding was assigned for error.
