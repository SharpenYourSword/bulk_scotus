Arthur, the collector of the port of New York, imposed upon them, and collected, under protest, a duty of ninety per cent of thirty-five per cent <i>ad valorem</i>, under the sixth section of the tariff act of 1864 (13 Stat. 209), which imposes that duty upon 'cotton braids, insertings, lace trimmings, or bobbinets, and all other manufactures of cotton not otherwise provided for.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appeared, upon the trial of the suit to recover the excess so paid, that there were goods known as cotton braids, used for other purposes, but that the goods in question were commercially known as 'hat braids,' and used exclusively for making and trimming hats and bonnets.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below, being of the opinion that the articles were only liable to duty at thirty per cent, under the eighth section of the act of July 14, 1862 (12 Stat. 551), so instructed the jury, and directed a verdict for the plaintiff. Judgment having been rendered thereon, the collector brought the case here.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Assistant-Attorney-General Smith</i> for the plaintiff in error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. H.
