The importers claimed it to be dutiable as 'chocolate,' under the first section of the act of June 6, 1872 (17 id. 231), which imposes a duty of five cents per pound.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried by the court below, without the intervention of a jury; and, by an agreed statement of facts, it was admitted that the chocolate was in boxes containing thirty-six little bricks, done up in separate papers, each box weighing about half a pound; and that the chocolate, being such as is ordinarily sold by confectioners as confectionery, and by the box or package, was valued at over thirty cents per pound.
