The article in question is manufactured from cow hair and cotton; of these the cotton is assessed at a higher rate of duty than the hair, and, therefore, the article is assessed as a manufacture of cotton, and hence it is insisted, under the act of 1872, as a manufacture of cotton it is entitled to the deduction claimed.</p>\n<p>The defect in this argument is apparent. The article in question does not fall within the terms of either part of the clause of the act of 1872, \"all manufactures of cotton, of which cotton is the component part of chief value.\" The first part gives the deduction to manufactures of cotton, which might be understood to mean those which are wholly of cotton. If it also includes a manufacture of which cotton is one of the components only, the cotton must be the component of chief value.
