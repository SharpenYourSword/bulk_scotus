If not paid, interest to be added at the rate of six per cent.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The importers entered the goods at the net price shated in the invoice,&#8212;francs, 8,494.95,&#8212;and declared on the entry as follows: 'Cash not paid on these goods, but are passed to our account, and are subject to interest at six per cent per annum.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case finds, as matter of fact, that 8,494.95 francs was the actual market value of the goods at the time of their exportation, in the principal market of the country from which they were exported, and that the purchase by the importers was at the figures named.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appraisers disallowed the discount of two per cent, on the ground that the importers stated in the entry that the cash was not paid. The collector thereupon fixed the value of the goods at 8,670.25 francs; and the duty charged upon that valuation having been paid under protest, the importers brought suit to recover the excess.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment was rendered in their favor, and the collector brought the case here.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Assistant-Attorney-General Smith</i> for the plaintiff in error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. William G.

The entered or invoiced value spoken of in the statute means the value as it is stated in or upon the invoice. That value was, francs, 8,494.95. The value means the cash value. The price at thirty days' credit might be different, and the difference would probably be greatly increased by a credit of six months or a year, but the value or cost would still be the same. The difference would be chargeable to the credit, and not to a difference in the value of the goods. That the price was to bear interest at six per cent until paid for, or at sixty per cent, had no influence upon the question of their value. We think it quite clear that the net price is stated in this invoice to be the value of the goods; viz., francs, 8,494.95.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Ballard et al.</i> v. <i>Thomas</i> (19 How. 382), is cited as an authority to the contrary.

It relates simply to the mode of payment, which may, if observed, operate as a satisfaction of the price to be paid, by the acceptance of a less sum.'
