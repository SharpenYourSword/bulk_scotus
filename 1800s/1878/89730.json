In pursuance of this arrangement, on the 17th of September, the bank transmitted to Schuchardt &amp; Sons its drafts on Seignouret Fr\u00e8res to the amount of 250,000 francs, and, at the same time, drew on Schuchardt &amp; Sons against said drafts for the sum of $50,000. On the same day, or the day following, securities of the bank to the amount of $60,000 were selected by the note clerk, by direction of Charles Cavaroc, president of the bank, put into an envelope indorsed with the name of Schuchardt &amp; Sons, and handed to Cavaroc, who handed them to the cashier; and thereafter they were treated in precisely the same manner as the securities which were selected for the Credit Mobilier and the Park Bank, as shown in the cases which have just been decided.
