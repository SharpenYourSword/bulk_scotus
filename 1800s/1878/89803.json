The complaint alleges that the said coupons are for different sums of money, depending on the size of the bonds, and are in the form following, to wit:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'$7.00. The County of Pickens, State of South Carolina, will pay the bearer on the first day of January, 1874, seven dollars, at Pickens Court-house, for annual interest on bond No. 113.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'H. J. ANTHONY,</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'<i>Chairman of Board of County Commissioners</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Receivable in payment of taxes.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#8212;and that the plaintiff is the <i>bona fide</i> holder of them for value, and that they, though due, have not been paid.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment was rendered in favor of the bank. Several defences, interposed below, were abandoned here. The remaining facts and the assignment of error are mentioned in the opinion of the court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. William W. Boyce</i> for the plaintiff in error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 'county of Pickens' not having been sued by its corporate name, no judgment on its contracts can be rendered against it in this suit. A corporation (unless empowered to sue and be sued in the name of its clerk or trustee) should sue and be sued by the name in which it is incorporated. Brown, Actions at Law, 115; 1 Saunders, Plead. and Evid. 387. The statutes of the State do not authorize a suit for the enforcement of a county liability to be brought against the persons who constitute the board of commissioners; and the present judgment against them as individuals must be reversed, because there is nothing on the record showing their personal liability. The plaintiff below must therefore fail, as against the county, because he has not sued it; he must fail against the defendants, because he asserts a claim for the payment of which they are not individually bound. The words 'county commissioners' added to their names are a <i>descriptio personarum</i>, and do not define or limit their liability.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The objection is not for misnomer, nor is it one of form. It is for a defect in matter of substance, apparent on the pleadings, for which error lies.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. James Lowndes</i> and <i>Mr. W. E.

On the trial, a judgment in favor of the Bank of Havanna was offered in evidence, which was objected to on the ground that the plaintiff had not proved itself to be a corporation, which was overruled. In sustaining the ruling, the Court of Appeals, by Denio, J., said: 'But I am of the opinion that when it appeared on the trial that the plaintiff's attorney had fallen into the mistake of stating the name which Mr. Cook had given to his bank as the creditor of Wickham and as the plaintiff in the suit, instead of his own name, a plain case was presented for amendment, under sect. 173 of the Code.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The error was disregarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So in <i>Traver</i> v. <i>Eighth Avenue R.
