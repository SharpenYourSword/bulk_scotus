The marshal thereupon seized certain real estate belonging to the city, consisting of 'two squares of ground which had formerly constituted the easterly bank of the Mississippi River, but which, by the gradual accretion of said easterly bank, had ceased to constitute the bank of the river, but which were now used by the public for wharf and levee purposes, said squares forming a portion of the land known as the 'Batture property,\" together with certain annual ground rents therefrom arising and belonging to the city.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On motion of the city, a rule on the plaintiff to show cause why the seizure should not be dissolved and set aside was issued.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing, the court being of 'opinion the said squares were public property which the city could not alienate without the permission of the General Assembly of the State of Louisiana, and that the said ground rents formed a portion of the public revenues of the said city,' and were, therefore, not subject to Klein's execution, made the rule to dissolve the seizure absolute, and ordered the marshal to release the property.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Klein thereupon brought the case here</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. J.
