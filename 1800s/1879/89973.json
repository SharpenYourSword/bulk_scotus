That the board of county commissioners of any county, the mayor and common council of any incorporated city, and the trustee, clerk, and treasurer of any municipal township in this State, are hereby empowered to issue the bonds of such county, city, or township, in any sum necessary, not greater than ten per cent, inclusive of all other bonded indebtedness of the taxable property of such county, city, or township, for the purpose of building bridges, free or otherwise, or to aid in the construction of railroads or water power, by donation thereto, or the taking of stock therein, or for other works of internal improvement. . . . <i>Provided further</i>, that under a proposal for aid to any railroad, any township having less than $200,000 taxable property may issue in addition to the ten per cent authorized in this section, ten per centum of an amount equal to the number of miles of railroad (agreed under such proposal to be constructed within such township) multiplied by six thousand. <i>And provided further</i>, that the limit prescribed in this section shall not apply and be considered to restrict or prevent the issuing of any bonds heretofore voted, or vote now pending, in any county or township in this State, and which bonds may not have yet been issued; but that the limit herein shall only be considered as applying only to the issuing of bonds to be hereafter voted under this law.'Sect. 2 provides when and where such bonds shall be payable.

That the bonds mentioned in plaintiff's petition, and to which the coupons in suit were attached, are void, because the whole issue was $75,000, and the taxable wealth of the township was: in 1871, prior to the vote on subscription, $148,686; in 1872, prior to the issue of the bonds, $181,591; and in 1873, prior to the maturity of the coupons first falling due, $159,557.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. That said bonds were issued without any legal warrant or authority, and are absolutely void, because there was an election held Nov. 7, 1871, whereat it was voted by the qualified electors of said township that it should subscribe $75,000 to the capital stock of the State Line, Oswego, and Southern Kansas Railroad Company, and issue its bonds in payment therefor; that said company, after said election and vote of Nov. 7, 1871, became, by and under the laws of the State of Kansas, duly consolidated with another railroad company, and that by such consolidation a new corporation was constituted and formed, called the Memphis, Carthage, and Northwestern Railroad Company; that said township, after said consolidation, subscribed $75,000 to the stock of said new corporation and issued its bonds in payment therefor, a part of which are those in said petition mentioned; that no other vote was ever taken in said township for subscribing to the stock of said new corporation or to that of any other railroad company.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff demurred to the answer, and on the following questions the judges were opposed in opinion:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Whether or not it is a defence to this action by a <i>bona fide</i> holder of the interest coupons sued on for value and without notice, that the amount of bonds, to wit, $75,000, issued by the defendant, was in excess of the amounts prescribed by the acts of the legislature of Kansas, approved Feb. 25, 1870, and approved March 2, 1872, in relation to the assessed taxable property of the defendant at the times of voting and issuing said bonds.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Whether or not it is a defence to this action by a <i>bona fide</i> holder for value of the interest coupons sued on without actual notice, that after the order of the board of county commissioners for an election, and after a favorable vote by a three-fifths majority of the qualified electors of Salamanca Township, according to law, to subscribe stock in the State Line, Oswego, and Southern Kansas Railroad Company, payable in negotiable bonds, to aid in the construction of its railroad, the subscription of stock and the issue of bonds without any further election were made to the Memphis, Carthage, and Northwestern Railroad Company with which said prior company, in whose favor the vote was had, had become merged and consolidated under a law existing at the time of said election, to form a continuous line.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The demurrer was overruled, and final judgment rendered for the township.

The power of the State Line, Oswego, and Southern Kansas Railroad Company to consolidate with other companies existed when the vote for subscription was taken in the township. When the consolidation took place there was a perfected power in the township to subscribe to the stock of that company, and there was also an existing privilege in the company to receive the subscription.

In this particular they occupied the position of the county court in the Scotland County case. They were to all intents and purposes the township in its corporate capacity. In <i>Harshman</i> v. <i>Bates County</i> (92 id. 569), the case was different. There the county court was the mere agent of a corporation, with which it had no official connection. The difference between the two cases is precisely that between a principal and an agent, and it is so expressly said in the Scotland County case. In the one case the corporation is bound if the action of the officers is within their corporate powers, while in the other the action must be within the corporate powers delegated to the agent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the Circuit Court will be reversed, and the cause remanded for such further proceedings, not inconsistent with this opinion, as may appear to be necessary; and it is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>So ordered</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
