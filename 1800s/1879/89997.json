Volume 1 comprising the 1st, 2d, 3d, and 4th wards. The maps exhibit each lot and building, and the classes as shown by the different coloring and characters set forth in the reference.' The maps were made after a careful survey and examination of the lots and buildings in the enumerated wards of the city, and were so marked with arbitrary coloring and signs, explained by a reference or key, that an insurer could see at a glance what were the general characteristics of the different buildings within the territory delineated, and many other details of construction and occupancy necessary for his information when taking risks.

A copyright gives the author or the publisher the exclusive right of multiplying copies of what he has written or printed.

It needs no argument to show that the defendant's maps are not copies, either in whole or in part, of those of the complainants.
