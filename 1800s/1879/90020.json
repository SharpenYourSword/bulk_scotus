He therefore prays for an injunction and an account.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The company denies the allegations of the bill as to novelty and infringement, and claims that the reissues were illegal.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith, Jan. 22, 1870, filed in the Patent Office a disclaimer alleging that the specifications and claims of division B are too broad, and include that whereof he is not the inventor.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below, on the cause being set down for hearing, adjudged that the letters as reissued in division A and division C were valid; that Smith was the original and first inventor of the improvements therein described; that he recover of the company the profits received or made by it from the use, manufacture, or sale of the patented improvement; that a master take and report an account of such profits; and that an injunction be awarded.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The master reported that the company had made no profits, and the court, Jan. 27, 1876, passed a decree against the company for costs of suit. The company thereupon appealed.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Benjamin Dean</i> for the appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. R. P.
