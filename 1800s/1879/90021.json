A motion for a new trial was then made on exceptions taken during the progress of the cause, and on account of excessive damages. Trook entered a <i>remittitur</i> of $1,500, and the judgment was ultimately affirmed at a hearing in general term. The company then removed the case here by writ of error, which Trook moves to dismiss, on the ground that this court, under the act of Feb. 25, 1879 (20 Stat. 320), has no jurisdiction, as the 'matter in dispute exclusive of costs' does not exceed 'the value of $2,500.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. James G.
