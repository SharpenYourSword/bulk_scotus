CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>From this record it appears affirmatively that the only dispute between the parties is as to the right of the insurance association to withhold a transfer of stock until an indebtedness of a stockholder to it for $2,074.36 is paid. Such being the case, we have no jurisdiction of this appeal. In Gray v. Blanchard (97 U.S. 564) we held that a writ of error must be dismissed when it appears from the record, taken as a whole, that the amount actually in controversy between the parties was not sufficient to give us jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</div>",
