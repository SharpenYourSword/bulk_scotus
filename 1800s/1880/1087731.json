Such being the case, we have no jurisdiction of this appeal. In Gray v. Blanchard (97 U.S. 564) we held that a writ of error must be dismissed when it appears from the record, taken as a whole, that the amount actually in controversy between the parties was not sufficient to give us jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "", "id": 1087731, "judges": "Waite", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/1087731/", "sha1": "1cad425fcefea364823b563e21524d415a5d9bca", "source": "L", "time_retrieved": "2013-10-29T19:29:49.809314"}
