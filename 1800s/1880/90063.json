Slack, collector of internal revenue for the third collection district of Massachusetts, to recover a tax or duty of $860.33, paid to him, under protest, on the twenty-eighth day of February, 1870; which tax was assessed on or about the 19th of that month on sterling bond interest paid by said company in London in gold, in the previous month of January, by cashing certain coupons which then fell due.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The coupons were attached to certain sterling bonds issued by said company, to the amount of  95,700, and negotiated by their agents in London in 1852, or early in 1853. The bonds were due in July, 1872, and paid at maturity, in gold, in London.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So far as the company know, not one of them was ever held by any person in the United States, or by other than non-resident aliens, and the interest accruing was regularly paid in gold in full in London, without rebate or reservation of the United States internal-revenue tax.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appeal was duly made to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue before this suit was brought.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below found for the defendant, whereupon the company brought the case here, and assigns for error that the court below erred in finding that Congress had power to impose the tax in controversy, and that, upon the facts, judgment must be for the defendant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Francis W. Palfrey</i> for the plaintiff in error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a conceded proposition that the United States has not the power to tax non-resident aliens directly. As persons, they are not liable to our taxation. But it is alleged that their property was within our jurisdiction, and therefore taxable. The reply to this proposition is:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. That it is settled law in this court that the internal-revenue taxation on coupon interest is a tax on income, and so a tax on persons.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. That the money set apart by the railroad company to pay the coupon interest due to its non-resident alien bondholders was not taxable property within the jurisdiction of the United States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of the first proposition, it can hardly be necessary to do more than to cite <i>Haight</i> v. <i>Railroad Company</i>, 6 Wall. 15; <i>Railroad Company</i> v. <i>Jackson</i>, 7 id. 262, 269; <i>Barnes</i> v. <i>The Railroads</i>, 17 id. 294; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Railroad Company</i>, id. 322; <i>Stockdale</i> v. <i>Insurance Companies</i>, 20 id. 323, 330, 337; <i>Railroad Company</i> v. <i>Rose</i>, 95 U. S. 78.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And in support of the second: <i>State Tax on Foreign-held Bonds</i>, 15 Wall. 300, 324, 325; <i>Murray</i> v. <i>Charleston</i>, 96 U. S. 432; <i>Caruthers</i> v. <i>Humphrey</i>, 12 Mich. 270; <i>Van Husan</i> v. <i>Kanouse</i>, 13 id. 303; <i>Union Bank</i> v. <i>The State</i>, 9 Yerg.

The section is a part of the system of taxing incomes, earnings, and profits adopted during the late war, and abandoned as soon after that war was ended as it could be done safely. The corporations mentioned in this section are those engaged in furnishing road-ways and water-ways for the transportation of persons and property, and the manifest purpose of the law was to levy the tax on the net earnings of such companies. How were these 'earnings, profits, incomes, or gains' to be most certainly ascertained? In every well-conducted corporation of this character these profits were disposed of in one of four methods; namely, distributed to its stockholders as dividends, used in construction of its roads or canals, paid out for interest on its funded debts, or carried to a reserve or other fund remaining in its hands. Looking to these modes of distribution as the surest evidence of the earnings which Congress intended to tax, and as less liable to evasion than any other, the tax is imposed upon all of them. The books and records of the company are thus made evidence of the profits they have made, and the corporation itself is made responsible for the payment of the tax.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Manifestly such a mode of ascertaining the net earnings of the company would not be complete unless the sums paid as interest on their bonded debts were taken into the account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course it was competent for Congress to tax only the earnings after <i>deducting</i> this interest paid on their debt, or to treat the sum so paid as part of the net earnings, and paid out of them as dividends were.

Whether, as a question of international law, this declaration would relieve the corporation from the obligation to pay its foreign bondholder the full sum for which it contracted, we need not discuss; for this court, on all such subjects, is bound by the legislative and political departments of its own government. The tax is laid by Congress on the net earnings, which are the results of the business of the corporation, on which Congress had clearly a right to lay it; and being lawfully assessed and paid, it cannot be recovered back by reason of any inefficiency or ethical objection to the remedy over against the bondholder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Judgment affirmed</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>100 U.S. 595 (____)</b></center>\n<center><h1>RAILROAD COMPANY<br>\nv.<br>\nCOLLECTOR.</h1></center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center></center>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*596</span> Mr. Francis W.
