Pursuant to that authority, it purchased all the property of the Kentucky Improvement Company, real, personal, and mixed, including their franchise, subject, however, to the mortgage previously made by the grantors of their lands and improvements to secure a certain issue of bonds, amounting to $500,000, as therein more fully set forth. Due conveyance of the same was made to it by deed dated Feb. 28, 1870, as appears by the agreed statement of facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coupons were attached to the bonds, and it appears that an internal-revenue tax of two and a half per cent was assessed thereon by the official assessor. Payment of the tax, after an unsuccessful appeal to the Commissioner, was made by the rail way company. The present suit was instituted to recover back the amount paid, with interest, as having been illegally exacted. Service was made; and the parties appeared, and, having consented to the agreed statement of facts exhibited in the record, submitted the cause to the court without a jury. Hearing was had; and the court rendered judgment in favor of the defendant, and the plaintiff removed the cause into this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two errors are assigned: 1.
