Pursuant to the act of Congress, the collector rendered, under oath, a quarter-yearly account to the treasury of the sums of money collected for rent and storage beyond the rent paid for the stores to their owners. 5 Stat. 432; Rev.

His compensation, as received, was derived wholly from the other statutory sources of emolument, the findings of the court showing that he was not paid any thing out of the yearly amounts collected from rent and storage. Due credit was given for the annual amounts he received from the other sources of emolument during the six years, within the Statute of Limitations, as exhibited in the seventh finding of the court; and the same finding also contains a statement showing the additional amounts required for each of those years to bring up the compensation of the collector to the maximum rate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Argument to show that the aggregate received from all sources of emolument, including the receipts from rent and storage, is sufficient to justify the claim of the petitioner is certainly unnecessary, as it is clear to a demonstration that the computations of the court below are correct. Plainly it follows from those computations that the collector is entitled to that rate of compensation, unless it be denied that the receipts from rent and storage, as explained in the opinion in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lawson (supra</i>, p. 164), are not properly included in that aggregate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sums received for rent and storage, not exceeding $2,000 in any one year, if duly included in the quarterly accounts of collectors, are as much due to such officers of the non-enumerated ports as to the incumbents of the larger offices, and their right to the same rests on the same foundation. Actual necessity has always existed, since the Treasury Department was estab lished, for more storehouses for the deposit and safe-keeping of imported merchandise than the United States owned, and it cannot be doubted that all such as have been placed under the statutory control of collectors and have been used for that purpose according to law are, during the period they are so controlled, used, and occupied, public storehouses, within the meaning of the act of Congress requiring collectors to include receipts from that source in their quarterly accounts, and allowing them to retain out of the same a sum not exceeding $2,000 in any one year. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Macdonald</i>, 5 Wall. 647, 659; s. c. 2 Cliff. 270, 282.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of these matters are controverted by the Solicitor-General; but he insists that the payments were voluntary, and that the accounts having been settled cannot be opened, even if it appears that the demand and payments were both made under a mistake of law.
