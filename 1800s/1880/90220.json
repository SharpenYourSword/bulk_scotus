French, by the heirs-at-law of Henry F. Wade, Jr., to recover the possession of certain real estate in the city of New Orleans.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wade was the owner of the property when it was seized and a libel for its condemnation filed in the proper District Court of the United States, under the act of July 17, 1862 (12 Stat. 589), commonly called the Confiscation Acts, and the joint resolution of even date therewith. Id. 627. It was condemned May 6, 1865, as forfeited to the United States, and sold under a writ of <i>venditioni exponas</i>, Oct. 21, 1865. Wade was the purchaser, and he and his wife, by an authentic act passed before S. Magner, notary public, on the thirtieth day of that month, bargained and sold it in fee, with all legal warranties, to French. The latter took possession of it and made valuable improvements.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The act recites that the property was acquired by Wade 'at a sale made by the marshal of the United States for the eastern district of Louisiana, by virtue of a writ of <i>venditioni exponas</i> to him directed by the District Court of the United States for that district, in the suit entitled. <i>The United States</i> v. <i>One Piece of Ground</i>, &amp; c., the property of Henry F. Wade, Jr., No. 7969 of the docket of said court, as per deed of said marshal, dated the 24th of October, 1865, recorded in the clerk's office of said court in sales-book B, folios 340 and 341, hereto annexed as part hereof; said property belonged to said Wade, Jr., defendant in said suit, for having acquired the same by donation from his father, Henry F. Wade, and his mother, Lucretia Martin, by act passed before Theodore Guyole, late notary, on the 17th of May, 1860, and the same belonged to said donor and his wife, as community property.' Wade died Feb. 24, 1874.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiffs, and French sued out this writ of error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Benjamin F.
