From the decree they prayed for an appeal, which was allowed, with an order that it should 'operate as a <i>suprersedeas</i> and stay of execution until the final decree of the Supreme Court should be rendered therein, on the complainants giving bond in the sum of $1,000.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bond given was approved by the district judge.
