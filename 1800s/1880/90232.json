The facts were found by the Circuit Court pursuant to the act of Congress of April 13, 1876, c. 77 (18 Stat. 315), which in this respect is a re-enactment of the nineteenth section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, c. 20. 1 Stat. 83.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first-named act limits the power of this court upon appeals in such cases 'to a determination of the questions of law arising upon the record, and to such rulings of the Circuit Court, excepted to at the time, as may be presented by a bill of exceptions.'

The 'Newell' was a small vessel of seventy-eight tons burden. In the afternoon of the 23d of February, 1874, she anchored within the breakwater for shelter from an approaching storm. The 'Clara,' being on a voyage from New York to Baltimore, foreseeing the coming storm, bore away and also put into the breakwater for safety. She arrived about five o'clock A.M. on the 25th of February, 1874, and while proceeding to a proper anchorage collided with the 'Newell.'
