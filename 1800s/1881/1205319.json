That depends now, as it did before, on the value of the matter in dispute, which must exceed $5,000. This record does not show in express terms or by fair implication that the value of the property in controversy reaches that sum.</p>\n<p>Appeal dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "", "id": 1205319, "judges": "Waite", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/1205319/", "sha1": "2cbbbe31f9936abd777f3818e3c04ad038445422", "source": "L", "time_retrieved": "2013-10-29T21:59:31.799659"}
