Vernon Railroad Company. The county was in no way bound for the payment of the debt. It simply mortgaged its lands for the benefit of the company. Default having been made in the payment of the bonds, a suit was begun in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of Illinois to foreclose the mortgage. In this suit a decree was entered, June 25, 1874, finding the amount due from the company on its bonds, and directing that the lands of the county be sold and the proceeds applied to the debt. From this decree the county appealed to this court, giving a bond, with a large number of persons as sureties, in the penal sum of $40,000, conditioned according to law, a <i>supersedeas</i>. At the October Term, 1876, the decree below was affirmed here with costs and the cause remanded. <i>Supervisors</i> v. <i>Kennicott</i>, 94 U.S. 498.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was a suit on the appeal and <i>supersedeas</i> bond, the allegations in the declaration as to damages being as follows:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'A large amount of damages hath accrued to the said plaintiffs by the failure of the said board of supervisors to make good their plea, to wit, the amount of $100,000, consisting of $40,000 of interest which accrued on said decree during the pendency of said appeal, which is wholly unpaid, and of $200,000 of said decree remaining unsatisfied by sale of the lands ordered by said decree, and of $50,000 depreciation in the value of said lands during the pendency of said appeal, and of $25,000, attorneys' fees for attending to said appeal, and $50,000 taxes on said lands during the pendency of said appeal.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bill of exceptions shows that the case was submitted to the court on an agreed state of facts, it being stipulated 'that pleas proper in such case were on file.'

Such a statement was considered to be equivalent to a special verdict and to present questions of law alone for the consideration of the court. It is manifest that the act of 1865 was not intended to interfere with this practice. The evident object of that legislation was to give special findings the same effect for the purposes of a writ of error as a special verdict or an agreed case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This record shows distinctly that the court was only required to determine whether in law, on the agreed facts, the defendants were liable on their bond.

There was no issue but of law, and that the court found for the plaintiffs. The same case is brought here by the record, and we are entirely satisfied it is one we have the power to review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the consideration of the assignment of errors, which is to the effect that the court was wrong in giving judgment for the plaintiffs. Sect. 1000 of the Revised Statutes provides that when an appeal 'is a <i>supersedeas</i> and stays execution,' the security must be that the appellant 'shall prosecute his appeal to effect, and, if he fails to make his plea good, shall answer all damages and costs.' In regulating the practice under this statute, we, by our Rule 29, provide that in suits on mortgages 'indemnity . . . is only required in an amount sufficient to secure the sum recovered, for the use and detention of the property, and the costs of the suit, and 'just damages for delay,' and costs and interest on the appeal.' The damages to be answered for are clearly only such as are incident to the plea that fails, that is to say, the appeal that is taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal of Wayne County was from a decree which subjected its lands to the payment of the debt of the railroad company. By taking the appeal no new obligations were assumed in respect to the debt. Clearly, then, the damages which the county and its sureties bound themselves to answer must have been such only as followed from the delay in the sale of the property. That does not necessarily imply an obligation to pay the balance which remains of the mortgage debt after the entire proceeds of the lands have been applied to its satisfaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Jerome</i> v. <i>McCarter</i> (21 Wall. 17), we held that our rule did not require security for the payment of all the accumulation of interest on the mortgage debt pending the appeal, but only indemnity against loss by reason of such accumulation, the amount of which would depend in each case on its own facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The damages in this case claimed by the plaintiffs are, 1, for interest on the debt which accrued during the appeal; 2, the balance of the decree which remained unsatisfied after the sale; 3, depreciation in the value of the lands; 4, attorney's fees; and, 5, taxes on the lands. No claim is made for the use and detention of the property otherwise than in this way. The agreed case shows that there was an accumulation of interest on the debt during the appeal largely exceeding the penalty of the bond, and that a balance of the mortgage debt, also much more than the penalty of the bond, was left unpaid when the proceeds of the sale had all been applied in accordance with the terms of the decree. This is the extent of what was agreed on. There is no statement that the lands had depreciated in value or that taxes had accumulated. Neither is it stated that any loss had actually accrued to the appellees by reason of the stay of sale. So far as appears, the lands may have increased in value to an amount larger than the accumulation of interest, and the taxes may have been paid. The single question, therefore, was presented to the court, whether on the agreed facts the county and its sureties were liable in law to the extent of their bond for the accumulation of interest or the balance of the mortgage debt. The judgment was to the effect that they were. In this we think there was error. Upon the agreed facts no damages had resulted from the appeal for which the county could in law be required to answer, and the judgment should have been for the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were other rulings presented by the bill of exceptions, but as upon the whole case as made there can be no recovery, we have considered it unnecessary to state them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the Circuit Court will be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings to be had therein not inconsistent with this opinion; and it is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>So ordered</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>103 U.S. 554 (____)</b></center>\n<center><h1>SUPERVISORS<br>\nv.<br>\nKENNICOTT.</h1></center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center></center>\n<p>The case was argued by Mr. C.C.

Sect. 1000 of the Revised Statutes provides that when an appeal \"is a supersedeas and stays execution,\" the security must be that the appellant \"shall prosecute his appeal to effect, and, if he fails to make his plea good, shall answer all damages and costs.\" In regulating the practice under this statute, we, by our Rule 29, provide that in suits on mortgages \"indemnity ... is only required in an amount sufficient to secure the sum recovered, for the use and detention of the property, and the costs of the suit, and `just damages for delay,' and costs and interest on the appeal.\" The damages to be answered for are clearly only such as are incident to the plea that fails, that is to say, the appeal that is taken.</p>\n<p>The appeal of Wayne County was from a decree which subjected its lands to the payment of the debt of the railroad company. By taking the appeal no new obligations were assumed in respect to the debt. Clearly, then, the damages which the county and its sureties bound themselves to answer must have been such only as followed from the delay in the sale of the property. That does not necessarily imply an obligation to pay the balance which remains of the mortgage debt after the entire proceeds of the lands have been applied to its satisfaction.</p>\n<p>In Jerome v. McCarter (21 Wall. 17), we held that our rule did not require security for the payment of all the accumulation of interest on the mortgage debt pending the appeal, but only indemnity against loss by reason of such accumulation, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*558</span> the amount of which would depend in each case on its own facts.</p>\n<p>The damages in this case claimed by the plaintiffs are, 1, for interest on the debt which accrued during the appeal; 2, the balance of the decree which remained unsatisfied after the sale; 3, depreciation in the value of the lands; 4, attorney's fees; and, 5, taxes on the lands. No claim is made for the use and detention of the property otherwise than in this way. The agreed case shows that there was an accumulation of interest on the debt during the appeal largely exceeding the penalty of the bond, and that a balance of the mortgage debt, also much more than the penalty of the bond, was left unpaid when the proceeds of the sale had all been applied in accordance with the terms of the decree. This is the extent of what was agreed on. There is no statement that the lands had depreciated in value or that taxes had accumulated. Neither is it stated that any loss had actually accrued to the appellees by reason of the stay of sale. So far as appears, the lands may have increased in value to an amount larger than the accumulation of interest, and the taxes may have been paid. The single question, therefore, was presented to the court, whether on the agreed facts the county and its sureties were liable in law to the extent of their bond for the accumulation of interest or the balance of the mortgage debt. The judgment was to the effect that they were. In this we think there was error. Upon the agreed facts no damages had resulted from the appeal for which the county could in law be required to answer, and the judgment should have been for the defendants.</p>\n<p>There were other rulings presented by the bill of exceptions, but as upon the whole case as made there can be no recovery, we have considered it unnecessary to state them.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Circuit Court will be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings to be had therein not inconsistent with this opinion; and it is</p>\n<p>So ordered.</p>\n</div>", "id": 90360, "judges": "Waite", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/90360/", "sha1": "2dedaf804cd9fe52fcf254a57ddbd1c5815f131d", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:02:32"}
