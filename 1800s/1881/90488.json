Movius v. Arthur, 95 U.S. 144; Arthur v. Lahey, 96 id. 112.</p>\n<p>It is conceded that stockings made on frames have been dutiable eo nomine since 1842, and by four different enactments: subd. 7 and 9 of sect. 1 of the act of Aug. 30, 1842, c. 270 (5 Stat. 549); sched. C of sect. 11 of the act of July 30, 1846, c. 74 (9 Stat. 44); sect. 22 of the act of March 2, 1861, c. 68 (12 Stat. 191); sect. 2 of the act of July 14, 1862, c. 163. Id. 556. Now, when we find, as we do in schedule M of sect. 2504, \"stockings ... made on frames, of whatever material composed, except silk and linen, worn by men, women, and children,\" it seems to us clear beyond question that goods coming within that specific description are dutiable in the way thus provided, rather than as \"knit goods ... composed wholly or in part of worsted.\" It may be true, as suggested, that if there had been no revision, and we had been required to construe the statutes as they stood before Dec. 1, 1873, a different conclusion might have been reached. We have not deemed it necessary to institute such an inquiry, for it would be contrary to all the rules of construction to say that where in one part of a section of a statute it was provided that \"stockings made on frames, of whatever material composed, except silk or linen,\" should pay duties at a certain rate, it was not plain such articles were not in any just sense \"otherwise provided for\" in a preceding clause of the same section fixing the duties to be paid on \"knit goods composed wholly or in part of worsted.\" The judgment below was before United States v. Bowen (supra), was decided here.</p>\n<p>Judgment reversed and a venire de novo awarded.</p>\n<p>NOTE. \u0097 This opinion was announced at the last term.

Some of them were wholly worsted. The others were composed of cotton and worsted, cotton being the material of chief value. They were intended to be worn by men, women, and children, and were made on frames. They were also 'knit goods,' this term comprising all goods made on frames, and also all hand-knit stockings and other knitted articles of various kinds.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They were classified by the appraiser as worsted knit goods, costing over eighty cents a pound, and Arthur, the collector of customs of the port of New York, exacted a duty at the rate of ninety per cent of fifty cents per pound and thirty-five per cent <i>ad valorem</i>, holding that the goods were, as knit goods, subject to the duty prescribed by schedule L, class 3 sect. 2504, Rev. Stat. The importer claimed that they were dutiable as stockings made on frames, worn by men, women, and children, and subject to the duty prescribed in schedule M. Both schedules are set out in the opinion of this court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The duties claimed by the collector were paid under protest, and Vietor brought this suit against him.
