The decree ordered a sale according to the usual course and practice of the court, which, in the case of <i>Brine</i> v. <i>Insurance Company</i> (96 U.S. 627), we held to mean a sale without any right of redemption. Such a sale was made to Flint. An order confirming it, and for a deed, and the delivery of possession, and expressly cutting off all right of redemption, was entered by the court on the 13th of March, 1878, with a further decree against the assignee for payment, out of assets <i>pro rata</i>, of a balance not satisfied by the sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the seventeenth day of October, 1879, Burley filed in the same court, but without leave, a bill of review, seeking to reverse so much of the former decrees of the court as denied the statutory right of redemption given by the laws of Illinois in regard to the land sold under such decrees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A hearing was had on a motion to dismiss, which, by consent of counsel, as the record states, was to be treated also as a demurrer.

He does not offer to redeem, by payment of the amount due on the original mortgage, or to pay the amount bid at the sale by Flint, nor tender any sum as assurance that he will do so.
