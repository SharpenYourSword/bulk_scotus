CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE, in delivering the opinion of the court in that case, said:</p>\n<p>The petition of Guion was for leave to appeal from a decree in a suit to which he was not a party. We decided in <i>Ex parte Cutting,</i> 94 U.S. 14, that such an appeal could not be taken. He had applied for leave to become a party, but this leave was not given. So he is not a party to the decree from which he appeals. But if he is, he has never perfected an appeal by giving the necessary security.</p>\n<p><i>Appeal dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</i></p>\n</div>",
