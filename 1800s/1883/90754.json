If it be conceded that the excluded evidence was admissible under the plea of non est factum, \u0097 which was the only plea to the special counts on the bonds and coupons, \u0097 and, also, that it tended to show fraud or illegality in their inception, still there was no error in the ruling of the court. For if, as counsel contend, proof of such fraud or illegality would shift the burden of proof upon the defendant in error to show how and upon what consideration he came by them, that exigency was met by proof that he was in every sense a bona fide holder for value. That he purchased the bonds for value and without notice of any fraud or illegality upon the part of the commissioners in the exercise of the power conferred by the statute, was so clearly shown, that the court below was justified in saying to the jury \u0097 as, in effect, it did \u0097 that the evidence left no room to dispute the fact.
