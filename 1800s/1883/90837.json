From that decree an appeal was taken to the circuit court for the district, where, on the fourteenth of October, 1881, it was decreed 'that the libelant recover for himself and the other parties in interest, from the respondent, Samuel Jackson, and his stipulators, Joseph D. Potts, William G. Warden, Edward N. Wright, and James A. Wright, his or their damages for the collision mentioned in the libel, * * * aggregating, in all, the sum of $51,594.14.' The decree was also entered as a lien against the real estate of the stipulators.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the rendition of this decree an appeal was taken by the claimant to this court, the petitioners signing a <i>supersedeas</i> bond as sureties. The petitioners being seized of real estate in the district, applied to the circuit court to vacate the decree against them, on the ground that it was inadvertently entered and caused a cloud on the titles to their property. The court declined to make the order, and this application is now presented for a <i>mandamus</i> to the judges of the court requiring it to be done.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Morton P.

It would seem as though nothing more was needed to show the power of the court to include the stipulators in the original decree. Under section 1007 of the Revised Statutes, no execution can issue until the expiration of 10 days after the entry of the decree. In this respect these decrees are like others.
