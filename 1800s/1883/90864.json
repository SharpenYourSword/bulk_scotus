One-half of the bonds were sold by the county and the proceeds paid to the company, while the remainder were delivered in full payment of the balance due on the subscription. The subscription was made and bonds issued in pursuance of a provision in the company's charter which made it 'lawful for the county court of any county in which any part of the railroad or <i>branches</i> may be, or any county adjacent thereto, to subscribe to the stock of said company, * * * and for the stock subscribed in behalf of the county may issue the bonds of the county to raise the funds to pay the same, and to take proper steps to protect the interest and credit of the county court; may appoint an agent to represent the county, vote for it, and receive its dividends.'
