The indictment consists of four counts framed under section 5392 of the Revised Statutes, namely:</p>\n<p>\"Every person who, having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed is true, wilfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true, is guilty of perjury, and shall be punished by a fine of not more than two thousand dollars, and by imprisonment at hard labor not more than five years; and shall moreover thereafter be incapable of giving testimony in any court of the United States until such time as the judgment against him is reversed.\"</p>\n<p>In the first three counts of the indictment, after setting out the emolument returns, and their verification by oath of the defendant, the falsity of the accounts and the corrupt perjury <span class=\"star-pagination\">*339</span> of the defendant in swearing to them, each count closed with this language:</p>\n<p>\"And so the grand jurors aforesaid, on their oaths and affirmations aforesaid, present that he, the said Thomas Ambrose, having taken the said oath, before the said officer who was competent to administer the same, that said written declaration by him so subscribed as aforesaid was true, wilfully and contrary to said oath did then and there unlawfully subscribe said matters heretofore set forth, which were material and which he did not believe to be true, contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the United States of America.\"</p>\n<p>A demurrer was filed to the whole indictment, on the ground relied on here, also that the paper to the truth of which defendant swears, as it is set forth in the indictment, is neither a <i>declaration,</i> as it is charged to be in the first three counts, nor a <i>certificate,</i> as charged in the last, within the meaning of those words in section 5392.

Indeed, the word 'declaration,' as a word of art in the law, is generally used to signify the plea by which a plaintiff in a suit at law sets out his cause of action, as the word 'complaint' is in the same sense the technical name of a bill in chancery. The fact that in many acts of congress cited by counsel that body has used the word to signify a statement in writing, whether sworn to or not, as the foundation in many cases of official action, or as preliminary to the assertion of rights by the party who makes the declaration, is far from proving that the use of the word in the act concerning perjury is limited to these cases. The inference is strong the other way, for the word is used in the cases cited in regard to so many and such diverse transactions, that it can, in view of them all, have no other meaning than what is attached to it in ordinary use.

Nor can he be mislead in any way, because what he says in that writing is, in the correct use of language, his sworn declaration on that subject. But the perjury in all such cases consists in the oath by which the party indicted swears to the truth of some matter, and this oath may be said to be the false statement of the statute. Or, in another sense, it may be said that the written statement and the oath of the party that it is true, all constitute the <i>declaration</i> or <i>certificate</i> of the statute, for the falsity of which he is chargeable with perjury and liable to punishment. The previously-prepared writing, his oath to its truth, or the whole taken together, is, in our opinion, a declaration of the party within the meaning of the statute, and may be so well described in the indictment. We are quite satisfied that, as set forth in this indictment, these are material matters under the statute, and if defendant did not believe them to be true when he swore to and subscribed the statement that they were true, that he is guilty of perjury, as declared in section 5392; and we think the word 'declaration' correctly defines such statement.
