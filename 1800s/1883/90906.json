The appellee has not appeared and has never been served with a citation. The decree was entered on the fourteenth of June, 1879, and at the foot of the entry is the following: 'Petitioner prays an appeal, which is granted upon bond and security being given, according to law, within thirty days.' A copy of what purports to be an appeal bond, filed on the third of July, 1879, is found in the transcript, but there is no evidence that it was ever approved or taken as good and sufficient security by the court, or any justice or judge thereof. A commissioner of the circuit court has certified that he knew the obligors to be good and responsible for any cost that might accrue in the cause, but that is not enough. Section 1000 of the Revised Statutes requires the justice or judge signing the citation to take the security. This power cannot be delegated to the clerk or to a commissioner. <i>O'Reilly</i> v. <i>Edrington</i>, 96 U. S. 726.
