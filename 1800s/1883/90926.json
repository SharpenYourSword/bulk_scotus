BANKING ASS'N and others<br>v.<br>ADAMS and others.</p>\n    <p class=\"date\">November 12, 1883.</p>\n    <p class=\"date\">In equity. The facts, as they appear from the pleadings and evidence, were as follows: A firm doing business in Louisiana, under the name of Tucker Brothers, on February 24, 1860, made and delivered their promissory note of that date for $5,000, payable February 15, 1860, to the Bank of New Orleans, which afterwards, by virtue of the provisions of the 'act to provide a national currency,' etc., passed June 3, 1864, became a national bank under the name of the New Orleans National Banking Association. Tucker Brothers, on the same day, executed three other notes for $5,000, one of them, payable to Godfrey Barnsley, falling due January 21, 1861. To secure these four notes the makers executed a mortgage on a certain plantation in La Fourche parish, Louisiana. Two of the notes were paid, but those given to the Bank of New Orleans and Barnsley were not paid at maturity. Thereupon the bank, having instituted a suit on the mortgage and the note held by it on June 11, 1867, obtained a decree of foreclosure against Tucker Brothers, by virtue of which, on September 7, 1867, the mortgaged property was sold by the sheriff to one Albert N. Cummings for the price of $13,025, to satisfy said unpaid notes. Cummings being unable to pay the purchase money, it was agreed between him and the parties entitled to the proceeds of the sale that he should have time; whereupon Cummings, on September 7, 1867, executed an agreement in writing, before J. K. Gourdain, a notary of the parish of La Fourche, in which he recited that he had not paid the purchase money of the plantation, and declared as follows: 'That he corresponded and compromised with the mortgage creditors hereinafter named, who agreed to give him time, without, however, impairing or novating the original claims, the right to enforce which they expressly reserved.' Cummings, then, by this same agreement stipulated that out of the price of the plantation he would pay to one Gaubert the sum of $1,851.10, on or before March 1, 1861, he holding the first privilege on a part of the plantation for that amount; to Barnsley the sum of $4,904.40, on or before May 15, 1870; and to the Bank of New Orleans $6,269.50, on or before May 1, 1870,&#8212;and that all these sums should bear interest at the rate of 8 per cent. per annum after maturity till paid. The agreement then further declared as follows:</p>\n    <div class=\"prelims\">\n      <p class=\"indent\">'It is understood, as above stated, that the parties hereto do not by these presents impair, affect, or novate their existing claims, and that in case of non-payment they will be entitled to enforce the judgments which may be held by them; and furthermore, that the original mortgages and privileges remain in full force and effect, and are not hereby novated, and if need be, for the purpose of avoiding all doubts, the said privileges and mortgages are hereby recognized as operating on the said property in the proportions aforesaid, and to secure the debts stated as aforesaid with the rank above stated.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This agreement was duly recorded in the office of the recorder of mortgages for the parish of La Fourche, on September 12, 1867.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the making of this agreement, Cummings, without having paid the sums the payment of which was promised, thereby sold the property to a Mrs. Tucker, who conveyed an undivided half interest to one Thomas J. Daunis, and Mrs. Tucker and Daunis then executed a mortgage on the same to John I. Adams &amp; Co., to secure certain notes made by Daunis to said firm, after which Mrs. Tucker conveyed her undivided half of the property to Daunis. Subsequently the Bank of New Orleans, now become the New Orleans National Banking Association, assuming that the agreement entered into by Cummings before Gourdain, the notary, on September 7, 1867, constituted a mortgage by which the balance found thereby to be due it from Cummings was secured, filed the bill in this case to foreclose the same. The bill made the firm of John I. Adams &amp; Co. parties defendant, charging that said firm claimed to have a mortgage on the property covered by the alleged mortgage of the complainant, and that if said firm had any lien upon or interest in said premises it was subsequent to September 12, 1867, the date of the inscription of the complainant's alleged mortgage.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this bill John I. Adams &amp; Co. filed a plea and answer, in which they set up that they, being holders of certain notes secured by a mortgage on the property described in the bill of complaint, instituted a certain suit upon the same against Thomas J. Daunis, in the district court sitting for the parish of La Fourche, and obtained a writ of seizure and sale against said property, under and by virtue of which the same was seized by the sheriff, and in October, 1875, sold to John I. Adams, who claimed title thereto. They further alleged that the agreement dated September 7, 1867, set forth in the complainant's bill, being the agreement of Cummings with the Bank of New Orleans and other holders of liens upon the plantation sold to him, was not a mortgage, and if it were, it was proscribed, because it had not been reinscribed within 10 years from the date of the original inscription, on September 12, 1867, as required by the law of Louisiana.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon final hearing upon the pleadings and evidence, the circuit court dismissed the bill, and from its decree the complainant appealed.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>J. D. Rouse, Wm. Grant</i>, and <i>Thos. L. Bayne</i>, for appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Jos. P. Hornor</i> and <i>W. S.

But complainant insists that the agreement made by Cummings on the day last named, with the Bank of New Orleans and other parties entitled to the proceeds of the sale, constituted a mortgage, and that the same having, on September 12, 1867, been recorded in the office of the recorder of mortgages for the parish in which the lands were situate, secured them a lien and privilege on the premises from the date of said record. We are of opinion that this contention is not well founded. While it may be conceded that no precise form of words is necessary to constitute a mortgage, yet there must be a present purpose of the mortgagor to pledge his land for the payment of a sum of money, or the performance of some other act, or it cannot be construed to be a mortgage. <i>Wilcox</i> v. <i>Morris</i>, 1 Murph. 116; S.
