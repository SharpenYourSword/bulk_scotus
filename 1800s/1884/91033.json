A formal tender of that sum was made on the twenty-sixth of February, 1883, and the money deposited in court for Knox, the plaintiff, where it remained until the fourteenth of March, nine days after the judgment was rendered, when it was withdrawn by the railroad company, without prejudice, on the order of the court, and with the consent and agreement of Knox. The bill of exceptions also shows an admitted liability of the company for the amount of the tender. The case is, therefore, in all material respects, like that of <i>Tintsman</i> v. <i>Nat. Bank</i>, 100 U. S. 6, where the writ was dismissed, althought the judgment was for $8,233.59, because, by an agreed statement of facts in the record, it appeared that the defendant admitted he owed $5,009.59 of the amount recovered. To the same effect is <i>Jennes</i> v. <i>Citizens' Nat. Bank of Romeo, ante</i>, 425.
