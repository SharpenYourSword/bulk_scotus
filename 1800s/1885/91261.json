To that court, therefore, according to many decisions of this court, the writ of error was properly directed to bring the record here for review. <i>Gelston</i> v. <i>Hogt</i>, 3 Wheat. 246; <i>Atherton</i> v. <i>Fowler</i>, 91 U.

This rule is applicable to writs of error to the state courts in like manner as to circuit courts. <i>Scarborough</i> v. <i>Pargoud</i>, 108 U. S. 567; S. C. 2 SUP. CT. REP. 877.

This docket, however, is made up necessarily after the main judgment is settled and entered in the order-book, or record of the court's proceedings, and it may be many days before this abstract of the judgment is made in the judgment docket, according to the convenience of the clerk.
