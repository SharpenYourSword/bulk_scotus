The complaint is in the usual form under the practice established in that State, where the action is brought to obtain possession of land alleged to be part of the public domain, but of which the plaintiff claims to have a better right of possession than his adversary. It alleges that on the 10th of March, 1879, the plaintiff was and still \"is the owner, by prior actual possession on the public domain, and by superiority of possessory title, and entitled to the immediate possession\" of the described premises, and that they are of the value of $5,000; that on the 20th of that month the defendants wrongfully and unlawfully entered upon the premises, and wrongfully and unlawfully withheld them from the plaintiff to his damage of $1,000; that the rents and profits of the premises, from the date of the ouster, have been $200 a month, and aggregate $3,000. The plaintiff, therefore, asks judgment for the possession of the premises and for the damages, rents and profits.

The patent was for a placer mining claim, and the plaintiff was allowed, against the objections of the defendant, to introduce, for the purpose of impeaching the patent, the proceedings before the Land Department of the government upon which it was issued. And the court decided that as it appeared upon such proceedings that the patent was issued upon four mining locations made after 1870 united in one claim, embracing two hundred and ninety acres or thereabouts, the patent was invalid and passed no title to the patentees, holding, in effect, that several distinct mining locations could not after that year be thus united in one claim for which a single patent could be issued.
