On the 18th of October, 1883, the Commissioner made the following indorsement on the writ:</p>\n              \"WASHINGTON, D.C., <i>October</i> 18<i>th,</i> 1883.\n<p>I hereby accept service of the within subpoena, to have the same effect as if duly served on me by a proper officer, and I do hereby acknowledge the receipt of a copy thereof.</p>\n                                  \"E.M.

Stat., as well as by the act of March 3, 1875, ch. 137, \u00a7 1, 18 Stat. 470, it is provided in substance that, with some exceptions which do not apply to this case, \"no civil suit shall be brought before either of said courts [the Circuit or District Courts of the United States] against an inhabitant of the United States, by any original process, in any other district than that of which he is an inhabitant, or in which he may be found at the time of serving the writ.\" We entertain <span class=\"star-pagination\">*132</span> no doubt that this statute applies to suits brought under \u00a7 4915. The applicant is to have his remedy under that section by bill in equity, and by the <i>adjudication</i> \"of the court having cognizance thereof, on notice to adverse parties and other due proceedings had.\" A bill in equity implies a suit in equity, with process and parties. The prayer for process is one of the component parts of the structure of a bill, and its purpose is to compel the defendant to appear and abide the determination of the court on the subject-matter of the proceeding. Story, Eq. Pl., \u00a7 44.</p>\n<p>The bill in this case was filed against the Commissioner alone, and it does not appear that he was an inhabitant of the district of Vermont. The Patent Office is in the Department of the Interior, Rev. Stat., \u00a7 475, which is one of the Executive Departments of the Government at the seat of government in the District of Columbia. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 437. The Commissioner of Patents is by law located in the Patent Office. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 476. His official residence is, therefore, at Washington, in the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p>The subp\u009cna in this case was delivered to him in the District of Columbia, and his acceptance of service was made there. That is apparent from the face of his indorsement and the letter which was written afterwards, and filed in the cause, undoubtedly as proof of a delivery of a copy of the bill which the law required should be served on him. Both the indorsement and the letter purport to have been written at Washington, and the letter in the Patent Office. Unless, therefore, the acceptance of service as indorsed on the writ is to be treated as a voluntary appearance by the Commissioner in the court in Vermont, without objection to the jurisdiction, the case stands as it would if the process had been actually served on him in the District of Columbia by some competent officer. The Circuit Court was of opinion that, by his acceptance of service the Commissioner waived all objection to the jurisdiction and consented to be sued away from the seat of government and from his residence. In this we think there was error. The fair meaning of the indorsement on the writ is that the Commissioner admits the service with the same effect it would have if <span class=\"star-pagination\">*133</span> made by an officer in the District of Columbia. No appearance is thereby entered in the cause. Service of the subp\u009cna in the District is acknowledged, but nothing more. In the letter which followed the indorsement of service, both counsel and the court were informed that the Commissioner declined to appear. The parties proceeded, therefore, at their own risk and without the consent of the defendant to the jurisdiction of the court. Such being the case, we are of opinion that the court was without jurisdiction and had no authority to enter the decree which has been appealed from. The act of Congress exempts a defendant from suit in any district of which he is not an inhabitant, or in which he is not found at the time of the service of the writ. It is an exemption which he may waive, but unless waived he need not answer and will not be bound by anything which may be done against him in his absence. What is here said of course does not apply to cases where the suit is brought and service is made under \u00a7\u00a7 736, 737, and 738 of the Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p>Without considering any of the other questions which have been presented in the argument, or which might be suggested under the statute,</p>\n<p><i>We reverse the decree of the Circuit Court and remand the cause, with instructions to dismiss the bill without prejudice for want of jurisdiction.</i></p>\n</div>",

No one was made defendant to the bill except the commissioner of patents, and Hill, Prentice, and the machine company, the complainants, were all citizens of Vermont.

We entertain no doubt that this statute applies to suits brought under section 4915. The applicant is to have his remedy under that section by bill in equity, and by the <i>adjudication</i> 'of the court having cognizance thereof, on notice to adverse parties, and other due proceedings had.' A bill in equity implies a suit in equity, with process and parties. The prayer for process is one of the component parts of the structure of a bill, and its purpose is to compel the defendant to appear and abide the determination of the court on the subjectmatter of the proceeding.

The patentoffice is in the department of the interior, (Rev. St. &#167; 475.) which is one of the executive departments of the government at the seat of government, in the District of Columbia. Rev.St. &#167; 437. The commissioner of patents is by law located in the patent-office. Rev. St. &#167; 476. His official residence is therefore at Washington, in the District of Columbia. The subpoena in this case was delivered to him in the District of Columbia, and his acceptance of service was made there. That is apparent from the face of his indorsement and the letter which was written afterwards, and filed in the cause undoubtedly as proof of a delivery of a copy of the bill which the law required should be served on him. Both the indorsement and the letter purport to have been written at Washington, and the letter in the patent-office. Unless, therefore, the acceptance of service as indorsed on the writ is to be treated as a voluntary appearance by the commissioner in the court in Vermont, without objection to the jurisdiction, the case stands as it would if the process had been actually served on him in the District of Columbia by some competent officer. The circuit court was of opinion that by his acceptance of service the commissioner waived all objection to the jurisdiction, and consented to be sued away from the seat of government and from his residence. In this we think there was error. The fair meaning of the indorsement on the writ is that the commissioner admits the service with the same effect it would have if made by an officer in the District of Columbia. No appearance is thereby entered in the cause. Service o  the subpoena in the District is acknowledged, but nothing more. In the letter which followed the indorsement of service, both counsel and the court were informed that the commissioner declined to appear. The parties proceeded, therefore, at their own risk, and without the consent of the defendant to the jurisdiction of the court. Such being the case, we are of opinion that the court was without jurisdiction, and had no authority to enter the decree which has been appealed from. The act of congress exempts a defendant from suit in any district of which he is not an inhabitant, or in which he is not found at the time of the service of the writ. It is an exemption which he may waive, but unless waived he need not answer, and will not be bound by anything which may be done against him in his absence. What is here said, of course, does not apply to cases where the suit is brought and service is made under sections 736, 737, and 738 of the Revised Statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without considering any of the other questions which have been presented in the argument, or which might be suggested under the statute, we reverse the decree of the circuit court and remand the cause, with instructions to dismiss the bill without prejudice, for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
