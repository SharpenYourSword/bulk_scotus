CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>This motion was made on the 18th of November last by Mr. John W. Ross, who had been specially appointed by the Board of Supervisors of the county as counsel for that purpose. Upon suggestion that counsel of record desired to oppose the motion, an order was made that notice be given them to appear and show cause against it if they desired to do so. This they have done, and it now appears that the suit was begun in a State court April 22, 1882. An answer was filed by the railroad company May 25, 1882. On the 30th of June the suit was removed to the Circuit Court of the United States. An amended answer was filed August 16, 1882, and on the same day a demurrer was filed to the answer. On the 6th of September the counsel for the county executed to the railroad company a receipt, of which the following is a copy:</p>\n  \"County of San Mateo, Plaintiff,  |  In U.S. Circuit Court,\n                <i>v.</i>                   &gt;   Ninth Circuit.

It also appears that on the 11th of the present month the railroad company paid into the treasury of the county the sum of $7613.30. The county has also had the use of the $7247.63 paid on the 6th of September, 1882, from the time of such payment until now.

The interests of the State, therefore, will be as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*142</span> well protected by the determination of that case as of this.

The next day a writ of error was brought to this court, and docketed here October 13, 1882. The case was elaborately argued before us December 19, 1882, but before a decision was reached a stipulation was entered into between the parties, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.

It also appears that on the eleventh of the present month the railroad company paid into the treasury of the county the sum of $7,613.30. The county has also had the use of the $7,247.63 paid on the sixth of September, 1882, from the time of such payment until now. The only condition attached to the payment made on the eleventh of this month is that, if when the account is finally settled between the county and Rhodes &amp; Barstow upon the basis of the assessment roll, principal, interest, delinquency, and attorneys' fees, it shall appear that the payments, including that to Rhodes &amp; Barstow, are more than the actual amount due, the excess shall be returned to the railroad company. The payments have been:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">To Rhodes and Barstow, taxes,. $7,247 63</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Attorneys' fees,................ 724 76</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">To the county,................ 7,613 30</p>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p class=\"indent\">In all,.................... $15,585 69</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">As this is more than the entire sum estimated by the counsel for the plaintiff to be due, it is clear that the debt for which the suit was brought has been unconditionally paid and satisfied.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">As to the objection that this was by agreement of parties made a test case, and many others are depending on its adjudication, it is sufficient to say that both sides agree that the suit of the county Santa Clara against the same company presents all the questions that are in this case, and that the parties have stipulated this need not be taken up for decision until that is heard. The interests of the state, therefore, will be as well protected by the determination of that case as of this. For the reason that there is no longer an existing cause of action in favor of the county against the railroad company, this writ of error is dismissed, each party to pay its own costs.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> S.
