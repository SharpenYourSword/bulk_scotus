of which an interlocutory decree was entered, in June, 1881, declaring the reissued patent to be valid, and to have been infringed as to all its claims, and awarding a recovery of profits and damages and a perpetual injunction. On the report of a master, a final decree was entered in February, 1882, by which the plaintiffs recovered $5689.91, as damages and costs. The defendants have appealed to this court.</p>\n<p>The specification of the original patent stated the purpose of the invention to be, to change the seeding shoes or hoes from a straight to a zigzag line, and <i>vice versa;</i> and, also, to so hang the shoes or hoes, as, in addition to the shifting process, to allow the shoes or hoes to be raised all together, or any one separately. The mechanical means described in that specification, for shifting the shoes, are these: In the front part of the machine is a rotating shaft, with cranks on it, so arranged that the shaft does not have a straight continuous axis, but has sets of axes in different lines, alternating, so that, yokes being attached, each to two of the cranks, and each two of the cranks having axes in a different line from the line of the axes of the next two adjoining cranks, the yokes being of substantially equal length, and being connected by drag-bars, at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*248</span> the rear ends of the drag-bars, to the shoes, a rotating motion given to the crank-shaft will shift the shoes, by moving all of them, each alternate shoe moving in an opposite direction from that in which the shoe next to it moves, and thus a space being opened or closed, of double the distance through which any shoe travels. To rotate the crank-shaft, there is a cross shaft in the rear of the machine, on the end of which is an upright lever, which extends upwards to form a handle, and has pivoted to it below a bar, which extends forward, and the forward end of which is formed into a rack, which works into a pinion on the end of the crank-shaft. By moving the lever, the rack and pinion are worked, and the crank-shaft is rotated, and the shoes are shifted. The extent of the rotating movement of the crank-shaft is about half a circle, back and forth. The original specification says, that, instead of employing the crank-shaft, the shoes may be united in sets to different bars, which may be straight, both bars being united to cross-bars or heads, at their ends; and that, by shifting these two bars, the shoes attached to them will be shifted. But there is no more specific description of mechanism for the purpose, nor any drawing of such mechanism.</p>\n<p>In the defendants' machine, every alternate shoe is connected with an immovable part of the frame, and every other alternate shoe is connected with a swinging cross-bar, which hangs down so as to have a motion back and forth in the arc of a circle, by reason of its being hung in bearings in the side of the frame. A rod extends from near the middle of the width of the swinging cross-bar to the rear part of the frame, behind the line from which the shoes are suspended, which rod is supported in the centre of its length, and terminates, at its rear end, in a handle, so that an operator can work it, and, by pulling it, shift simultaneously all the shoes that are attached to the swinging cross-bar. Two coiled springs are so arranged, that, when the rod is pulled, the springs are compressed, and, when the rod is released, the action of the springs tends to throw the swinging cross-bar and the shoes attached to it towards the front of the frame again, restoring them to the position from which the pulling of the rod moved them. Thus, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*249</span> only alternate shoes are shifted, but the positions of the toes of the shoes, relatively to each other, can be simultaneously changed, and a wider space, in a straight line, be opened between any two toes at any time. The shoes are so set that their toes are never in a straight line across, but, when nearest to each other, are somewhat out of a straight line, and the pulling of the rod causes the distance between them to increase. The shoes which move in increasing such distance do so through the rotating motion to and fro of the swinging cross-bar to which they are attached, such motion being imparted by the pulling, at the rear of the machine, of the rod attached to the swinging cross-bar. In the plaintiffs' machine, the shoes which move, in increasing such distance, do so through the rotating motion to and fro of the crank-shaft to which they are attached, such motion being imparted by the pushing at the rear of the machine of the rod that carries the rack, the rod being worked by a lever.</p>\n<p>An examination of the claims of the original and reissued patents shows that claim 2 of the reissue is substantially the same as claim 1 of the original; that claim 4 of the reissue is substantially the same as claim 2 of the original; and that claim 5 of the reissue is substantially the same as claim 3 of the original.</p>\n<p>The Circuit Court held that claim 2 of the reissue was infringed, although in the defendants' machine there is no lever such as the lever H of the patent, and no equivalent or substitute for it. The view taken was, that claim 2 was infringed, because the defendants use a rod, the end of which is pushed and pulled by the hand of the operator, while in the patent the lever H pulls and pushes the end of the rod. But the lever, or its equivalent, as a mechanical instrument, is made an essential element in claim 2, and dispensing with the lever, and using instead the human hand, is not the use of an equivalent, although in the plaintiffs' machine the hand is applied to work the lever. <i>Water Meter Co.</i> v. <i>Desper,</i> 101 U.S., 332, 337; <i>Gage</i> v. <i>Herring,</i> 107 U.S. 640, 648; <i>Fay</i> v. <i>Cordesman,</i> 109 U.S. 408, 420, 421; <i>Sargent</i> v. <i>Hall Safe and Lock Co.,</i> 114 U.S. 63, 86.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*250</span> In order to determine what construction ought to be given to the other claims of the reissue, it is necessary to consider an invention made by one Powers, at Madison, Wisconsin, in 1862, the invention of Davis being carried back only to September, 1866. During the winter of 1861-2, and the spring of 1862, Powers was selling, at Madison, grain drills with iron drag-bars. During the season of 1862, noticing the working of drills in the field, he conceived the idea that the shoes could be put into single and double ranks by a more easy method than that then used. He worked out a plan, and made a model of it, and applied for a patent, November 10, 1862. The patent was ordered to issue December 6, 1862, but was never issued. The reason is not stated. The specification filed states that the \"invention consists of a device to enable the shovels or plows of a drill to be set in single or double rows or ranks, with greater ease and facility than hitherto.\" The method described and shown in the drawings is to have a cross row of stationary shovels; and a cross row of other shovels, attached to a cross-bar, which is arranged, at each end of it, so as to slide to the extent of eight inches to and fro, in a groove. Thus, two rows may be made, or the sliding cross-bar may be set at a point where all the shovels will be in a line, and one row be formed. The movable cross-bar is moved by hand, and secured, when set, by bolts. The claim covers \"the method of double and single ranking the drill teeth, by the adjustment of the sliding cross-bar A, to which are attached the alternate drill teeth or shovels, to different positions between the side pieces of the frame.\" The description states, that, \"by this device, double or single ranking can be effected in a moment, instead of the more tedious process of other similar machines,\" and that \"double and single ranking is a highly important feature in a drill, to adapt it to different soils and circumstances.\" Powers put this shifting arrangement \"on to two or may be three drills\" which he had on hand. He testifies to the use of two of them, and says they worked perfectly, so far as changing the rank of the drill was concerned. This was a completed invention. The idea of changing the relative positions of the shoes by having one row of them stationary and moving the other, which is the idea developed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*251</span> in the defendants' machine, was fully embodied in Powers' machine. It had no lever and rod to do the work of the hand in moving the sliding cross-bar, and that cross-bar was held in position, when set, by bolts.</p>\n<p>In view of this invention of Powers, we are of opinion that the invention of the Davis patent must be limited, so far as the shifting apparatus is concerned, to the special arrangement of the rotating crank-shaft described, and shown in the drawings. The words \"substantially as described,\" found in each of the first two claims of the original patent, properly confined those claims to the shifting mechanism described. If claim 1 of the reissue is given a construction which includes any arrangement for shifting not substantially using a rotating crank-shaft, it becomes a claim which could not lawfully have been granted in the original patent; and, as a claim in a reissued patent, it is invalid, within the defences set up in the answer, because the application for the reissue was made nearly eleven years after the original patent was granted, and after machines effecting the shifting by other means than a rotating crank-shaft had gone into use subsequently to the date of the original patent, and no sufficient excuse is given for the laches and delay. The same remarks apply to claim 3 of the reissue.</p>\n<p>In view of the rulings of this court on the subject of reissued patents, made since the decision in this case was made by the court below, in May, 1881, this case must be considered in view of the fact that the new matter introduced into the specification of the reissue was put in for the purpose of reaching machines which the claims of the original patent would not reach, and of laying a foundation for claims 1 and 3 of the re-issue. The inventor and patentee, Davis, distinctly says this, in his testimony. The principal interpolation is in these words: \"The rack-bar or connecting-rod <i>m</i> may be used for this purpose, and thereby the shoes or hoes may be shifted from a straight to a zigzag line, or <i>vice versa,</i> said connecting-bar <i>m</i> being held in position, if desired, by any of the usual mechanical devices for that purpose.\" In the original specification <i>m</i> is called a \"rack-bar,\" because it is pivoted at one end to the lower end of the lever H, and has on its other end a rack taking <span class=\"star-pagination\">*252</span> into a pinion on the end of the crank-shaft. But, in the reissue, <i>m</i> is called \"a rack-bar or connecting-rod.\" Again, in the reissue, the reference to the letter H, as connected with and working the chain to be used with the sheave or wheel, in the second suggested alternative means of shifting, is erased, so as not to make the use of the lever H necessary. Before these changes, the defendants' machine, which has no lever and no rotating crank-shaft, would not have been within the scope of the original claims, but, if the rack-bar were to become a connecting-rod, it was thought it might cover the rod in the defendants' machine. Claim 3 of the reissue was framed on this view, of shifting by a rod alone, while claim 1 is made so broad as to seem to claim shifting by any means, by a single movement.</p>\n<p>As to claims 4, 5 and 6 of the reissue, the shifting mechanism of the patent, with its rotating crank-shaft, must, in view of the Powers invention, be considered as an element in each claim; and that mechanism is not used by the defendants.</p>\n<p>It follows from these views, that</p>\n<p><i>The decree of the Circuit Court must be reversed, and the case remanded, with a direction to dismiss the bill, with costs.</i></p>\n</div>",

of which an interlocutory decree was entered, in June, 1881, declaring the reissued patent to be valid, and to have been infringed as to all its claims, and awarding a recovery of profits and damages and a perpetual injunction. On the report of a master, a final decree was entered in February, 1882, by which the plaintiffs recovered $5689.91, as damages and costs. The defendants have appealed to this court.</p>\n<p>The specification of the original patent stated the purpose of the invention to be, to change the seeding shoes or hoes from a straight to a zigzag line, and <i>vice versa;</i> and, also, to so hang the shoes or hoes, as, in addition to the shifting process, to allow the shoes or hoes to be raised all together, or any one separately. The mechanical means described in that specification, for shifting the shoes, are these: In the front part of the machine is a rotating shaft, with cranks on it, so arranged that the shaft does not have a straight continuous axis, but has sets of axes in different lines, alternating, so that, yokes being attached, each to two of the cranks, and each two of the cranks having axes in a different line from the line of the axes of the next two adjoining cranks, the yokes being of substantially equal length, and being connected by drag-bars, at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*248</span> the rear ends of the drag-bars, to the shoes, a rotating motion given to the crank-shaft will shift the shoes, by moving all of them, each alternate shoe moving in an opposite direction from that in which the shoe next to it moves, and thus a space being opened or closed, of double the distance through which any shoe travels. To rotate the crank-shaft, there is a cross shaft in the rear of the machine, on the end of which is an upright lever, which extends upwards to form a handle, and has pivoted to it below a bar, which extends forward, and the forward end of which is formed into a rack, which works into a pinion on the end of the crank-shaft. By moving the lever, the rack and pinion are worked, and the crank-shaft is rotated, and the shoes are shifted. The extent of the rotating movement of the crank-shaft is about half a circle, back and forth. The original specification says, that, instead of employing the crank-shaft, the shoes may be united in sets to different bars, which may be straight, both bars being united to cross-bars or heads, at their ends; and that, by shifting these two bars, the shoes attached to them will be shifted. But there is no more specific description of mechanism for the purpose, nor any drawing of such mechanism.</p>\n<p>In the defendants' machine, every alternate shoe is connected with an immovable part of the frame, and every other alternate shoe is connected with a swinging cross-bar, which hangs down so as to have a motion back and forth in the arc of a circle, by reason of its being hung in bearings in the side of the frame. A rod extends from near the middle of the width of the swinging cross-bar to the rear part of the frame, behind the line from which the shoes are suspended, which rod is supported in the centre of its length, and terminates, at its rear end, in a handle, so that an operator can work it, and, by pulling it, shift simultaneously all the shoes that are attached to the swinging cross-bar. Two coiled springs are so arranged, that, when the rod is pulled, the springs are compressed, and, when the rod is released, the action of the springs tends to throw the swinging cross-bar and the shoes attached to it towards the front of the frame again, restoring them to the position from which the pulling of the rod moved them. Thus, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*249</span> only alternate shoes are shifted, but the positions of the toes of the shoes, relatively to each other, can be simultaneously changed, and a wider space, in a straight line, be opened between any two toes at any time. The shoes are so set that their toes are never in a straight line across, but, when nearest to each other, are somewhat out of a straight line, and the pulling of the rod causes the distance between them to increase. The shoes which move in increasing such distance do so through the rotating motion to and fro of the swinging cross-bar to which they are attached, such motion being imparted by the pulling, at the rear of the machine, of the rod attached to the swinging cross-bar. In the plaintiffs' machine, the shoes which move, in increasing such distance, do so through the rotating motion to and fro of the crank-shaft to which they are attached, such motion being imparted by the pushing at the rear of the machine of the rod that carries the rack, the rod being worked by a lever.</p>\n<p>An examination of the claims of the original and reissued patents shows that claim 2 of the reissue is substantially the same as claim 1 of the original; that claim 4 of the reissue is substantially the same as claim 2 of the original; and that claim 5 of the reissue is substantially the same as claim 3 of the original.</p>\n<p>The Circuit Court held that claim 2 of the reissue was infringed, although in the defendants' machine there is no lever such as the lever H of the patent, and no equivalent or substitute for it. The view taken was, that claim 2 was infringed, because the defendants use a rod, the end of which is pushed and pulled by the hand of the operator, while in the patent the lever H pulls and pushes the end of the rod. But the lever, or its equivalent, as a mechanical instrument, is made an essential element in claim 2, and dispensing with the lever, and using instead the human hand, is not the use of an equivalent, although in the plaintiffs' machine the hand is applied to work the lever. <i>Water Meter Co.</i> v. <i>Desper,</i> 101 U.S., 332, 337; <i>Gage</i> v. <i>Herring,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90803\"><a href=\"/opinion/90803/gage-v-herring/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, 648; <i>Fay</i> v. <i>Cordesman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90950\"><a href=\"/opinion/90950/fay-v-cordesman/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span>, 420, 421; <i>Sargent</i> v. <i>Hall Safe and Lock Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91344\"><a href=\"/opinion/91344/sargent-v-hall-safe-lock-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 86.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*250</span> In order to determine what construction ought to be given to the other claims of the reissue, it is necessary to consider an invention made by one Powers, at Madison, Wisconsin, in 1862, the invention of Davis being carried back only to September, 1866. During the winter of 1861-2, and the spring of 1862, Powers was selling, at Madison, grain drills with iron drag-bars. During the season of 1862, noticing the working of drills in the field, he conceived the idea that the shoes could be put into single and double ranks by a more easy method than that then used. He worked out a plan, and made a model of it, and applied for a patent, November 10, 1862. The patent was ordered to issue December 6, 1862, but was never issued. The reason is not stated. The specification filed states that the \"invention consists of a device to enable the shovels or plows of a drill to be set in single or double rows or ranks, with greater ease and facility than hitherto.\" The method described and shown in the drawings is to have a cross row of stationary shovels; and a cross row of other shovels, attached to a cross-bar, which is arranged, at each end of it, so as to slide to the extent of eight inches to and fro, in a groove. Thus, two rows may be made, or the sliding cross-bar may be set at a point where all the shovels will be in a line, and one row be formed. The movable cross-bar is moved by hand, and secured, when set, by bolts. The claim covers \"the method of double and single ranking the drill teeth, by the adjustment of the sliding cross-bar A, to which are attached the alternate drill teeth or shovels, to different positions between the side pieces of the frame.\" The description states, that, \"by this device, double or single ranking can be effected in a moment, instead of the more tedious process of other similar machines,\" and that \"double and single ranking is a highly important feature in a drill, to adapt it to different soils and circumstances.\" Powers put this shifting arrangement \"on to two or may be three drills\" which he had on hand. He testifies to the use of two of them, and says they worked perfectly, so far as changing the rank of the drill was concerned. This was a completed invention. The idea of changing the relative positions of the shoes by having one row of them stationary and moving the other, which is the idea developed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*251</span> in the defendants' machine, was fully embodied in Powers' machine. It had no lever and rod to do the work of the hand in moving the sliding cross-bar, and that cross-bar was held in position, when set, by bolts.</p>\n<p>In view of this invention of Powers, we are of opinion that the invention of the Davis patent must be limited, so far as the shifting apparatus is concerned, to the special arrangement of the rotating crank-shaft described, and shown in the drawings. The words \"substantially as described,\" found in each of the first two claims of the original patent, properly confined those claims to the shifting mechanism described. If claim 1 of the reissue is given a construction which includes any arrangement for shifting not substantially using a rotating crank-shaft, it becomes a claim which could not lawfully have been granted in the original patent; and, as a claim in a reissued patent, it is invalid, within the defences set up in the answer, because the application for the reissue was made nearly eleven years after the original patent was granted, and after machines effecting the shifting by other means than a rotating crank-shaft had gone into use subsequently to the date of the original patent, and no sufficient excuse is given for the laches and delay. The same remarks apply to claim 3 of the reissue.</p>\n<p>In view of the rulings of this court on the subject of reissued patents, made since the decision in this case was made by the court below, in May, 1881, this case must be considered in view of the fact that the new matter introduced into the specification of the reissue was put in for the purpose of reaching machines which the claims of the original patent would not reach, and of laying a foundation for claims 1 and 3 of the re-issue. The inventor and patentee, Davis, distinctly says this, in his testimony. The principal interpolation is in these words: \"The rack-bar or connecting-rod <i>m</i> may be used for this purpose, and thereby the shoes or hoes may be shifted from a straight to a zigzag line, or <i>vice versa,</i> said connecting-bar <i>m</i> being held in position, if desired, by any of the usual mechanical devices for that purpose.\" In the original specification <i>m</i> is called a \"rack-bar,\" because it is pivoted at one end to the lower end of the lever H, and has on its other end a rack taking <span class=\"star-pagination\">*252</span> into a pinion on the end of the crank-shaft. But, in the reissue, <i>m</i> is called \"a rack-bar or connecting-rod.\" Again, in the reissue, the reference to the letter H, as connected with and working the chain to be used with the sheave or wheel, in the second suggested alternative means of shifting, is erased, so as not to make the use of the lever H necessary. Before these changes, the defendants' machine, which has no lever and no rotating crank-shaft, would not have been within the scope of the original claims, but, if the rack-bar were to become a connecting-rod, it was thought it might cover the rod in the defendants' machine. Claim 3 of the reissue was framed on this view, of shifting by a rod alone, while claim 1 is made so broad as to seem to claim shifting by any means, by a single movement.</p>\n<p>As to claims 4, 5 and 6 of the reissue, the shifting mechanism of the patent, with its rotating crank-shaft, must, in view of the Powers invention, be considered as an element in each claim; and that mechanism is not used by the defendants.</p>\n<p>It follows from these views, that</p>\n<p><i>The decree of the Circuit Court must be reversed, and the case remanded, with a direction to dismiss the bill, with costs.</i></p>\n</div>",

B, is mounted a main frame, C, and on the main frame a      seed-box, D, the slides of which may be operated in any of      the well-known ways. In bearings, E, in the front portion of      the main frame, is hung, so as to rock or turn therein, a      zigzag or crank shaft, F, (shown detached in Fig. 2,) and to      the cranks or wrists, <i>a, a, a</i>, of this shaft are connected,      <i>seriatim</i>, the drag-bars, <i>b, b, b</i>, by means of bows or yokes,      <i>c</i>, each bow or yoke taking two of said wrists, as shown in      Fig. 1. To the rear ends of these dragbars, <i>b</i>, are attached      the shoes or hoes, G, in any of the usual wellknown ways. In      the projecting rear portion of the main frame, C, there is      hung a shaft, <i>d</i>, upon which there is a lever, <i>e</i>, by which it      can be rocked or rolled in its bearings. At suitable      distances upon this shaft, <i>d</i>, there is placed a series of      levers, <i>f, f</i>, one for each shoe or hoe, which are kept in      their proper positions on the shaft by pins, 1, 1, or other      suitable devices, but which can be moved independent of the      shaft or of each other, or all together, as will be      explained. The levers, <i>f</i>, have a hub or swell, <i>g</i>, at their      central portions, where they are slipped onto the shaft,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>d</i>; and into each one these hubs is set a pin, 2, which is      above the pins, 1, 1, in the shaft, so that each lever can be      turned upon the shaft; but, when the shaft is rocked or      turned, then all the levers are worked simultaneously. To the      forward ends of these levers, <i>f</i>, the shoes or hoes are      respectively connected by a link or hinged rod, <i>h</i>, the      rearward projecting ends of said levers serving as handles      for the operator to seize and work separately, when necessary      to do so, or he can raise the whole series by seizing and      working the lever, <i>e</i>. One end of the shaft, <i>d</i>, projects      through the timber of the main frame, for convenience of      placing the parts, and upon it is a lever, H, and a      spring-locking lever, <i>i</i>, connected with it, both of which      levers the operator may grasp at once, and by pressure first      unlock the catch, and then move the main lever, H, and the      shaft, <i>d</i>, as well as the parts connected with it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The catch or locking lever,<i>i</i>, takes into or against <i>a</i>      stopplate, <i>j</i>, on the main frame, when not otherwise      controlled. The upper portion of the lever, H, serves as a      handle to work it by, and to the lower end of it is pivoted a      rack-bar, <i>m</i>, which takes into a pinion, <i>n</i>,fastened on the end      of the crank or zigzag shaft, F, and when the pinion, <i>n</i>, is      turned the crank shaft is also turned, and, as it is turned,      it shifts the shoes or hoes into a zigzag or a straight line,      as the case may be. When the lever, H, and the zigzag shaft,      F, and their several connected and operative parts, are in      the positions shown by the <i>black</i> lines in Figs. 1 and 3, the      shoes or hoes, G, are then in a straight line across the      machine; but, when the lever, H, is shifted into the position      shown by the <i>red</i> lines in Fig. 3, it turns the shaft, and      moves the parts connected with them, and the shoes or hoes      will then stand in a zigzag line across the machine, as shown      by the <i>red</i> lines, or in what may be termed two lines, one in      advance of the other; and, that the shoes or hoes may be thus      moved into one or two lines, and still be susceptible of      being raised up separately, or in their series capacity,      their connections and attachments must all be hinged or      yielding. When there is an odd number of shoes or hoes on the      machine, the odd one should be in the rear series, in which      case there would be no necessity of locking the lever, H,      when the shoes <i>were</i> so</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">arranged, as the greater resistance on the greater number      would always keep them so. But, if an even number of shoes be      used, and an equal number in each row, then the lever would      have to be locked or fastened in both of its positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'It is obvious that other mechanical devices may be used for      shifting the shoes or hoes from a straight into a zigzag line      or <i>vice versa</i>. I have devised several ways of accomplishing      this movement, <i>as, for instance</i>, a sheave, pulley, or      chain-wheel may be keyed to the end of the crank-shaft, and      to this sheave or wheel a chain may be attached, and, passing      around it, <i>extend thence to the lever</i>, so that, by <i>working      the lever</i>, the same effect <i>would</i> be attained as by the rack      and pinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Another plan may be as follows: A crank or cross-arms may be      placed on the turning-shaft, and, by means of      connecting-rods, <i>which connect the cranks or arms with the      levers</i>, the shaft may be turned, and the shoes thus thrown      into a straight or zigzag line, as may be desired; or,      instead of the crank-shaft <i>to shift the shoes</i>, the shoes may      be united in sets to different bars, which may be straight,      both bars being united to cross-bars or heads at their ends.      Now, by shifting these two bars, <i>they will</i> shift the shoes      attached to them, <i>and change them</i> into the positions      herein-above described. When the hoes are set in a zigzag      line, as above mentioned, and are in that position raised up,      a pin, 3, in the extreme end of the shaft, <i>d</i>, will take      against a pin, 4, in the lever, H, and thereby shifting the      hoes into more nearly a straight line, as they rise, or into      quite a straight line, depending upon the extent to which      they are raised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Having <i>thus fully</i> described my invention, what I claim      <i>therein</i> as new, and desire to secure by letters patent, is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'1. <i>So attaching the shoes or hoes of a seed-planter to the      main frame as that, by means of a lever, or its equivalent      said shoes may be shifted from a straight to a zigzag line,      or</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>vice versa, at pleasure, substantially as described</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'2. <i>I also claim in combination with a series of shoes or      hoes that are capable of being changed from a straight to a      zigzay line, or vice versa, the so connecting of said shoes,      by independent levers, to the lifting-bar, as that they may      be raised by the operator individually, or as a whole,      substantially as described</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'3. <i>I also claim bringing the shoe to both its drag-bar and      its individual lever, so that the shoe may be raised and      lowered, in either of its changed positions, by a lever that      is permanently located, substantially as described</i>.'

In bearings, E, in the front portion of      the main frame, is hung, so as to rock or turn therein, a      zigzag or crank shaft, F, (shown detached in Fig. 2,) and to      the cranks or wrists, <i>a, a, a</i>, of this shaft are connected,      <i>seriatim</i>, the drag bars, <i>b, b, b</i>, by means of bows or yokes,      <i>c</i>, each bow or yoke taking two of said wrists, as shown in      Fig. 1. To the rear ends of these drag-bars, <i>b</i>, are attached      the shoes or hoes, G, in any of the usual well-known ways. In      the projecting rear portion of the main frame, C, there is      hung a shaft. <i>d</i>, upon which there is a lever, <i>e</i>, by which it      can be rocked or rolled in its bearings. At suitable      distances upon this shaft, <i>d</i>, there is placed a series of      levers, <i>f, f</i>, one for each shoe or hoe, which are kept in      their proper positions on the shaft by pins, 1, 1, or other      suitable devices, but which can be moved independent of the      shaft or of each other, or all together, as will be      explained. The levers, <i>f</i>, have a hub or swell, <i>g</i>, at their      central portions, where they are slipped onto the shaft, <i>d;</i>      and into each one of these hubs is set a pin, 2, which is      above the pins, 1, 1, in the shaft, so that each lever can be      turned upon the shaft; but, when the shaft is rocked or      turned, then all the levers are worked simultaneously.

The upper      portion of the lever, H, serves as a handle to work it by,      and to the lower end of it is pivoted a rack-bar <i>or      connecting-rod, m</i>, which takes into a pinion, <i>n</i>, fastened on the end of the crank or      zigzag shaft, F, and when the pinion, <i>n</i>, is turned the      crank-shaft is also turned, and, as it is turned, it shifts      the shoes or hoes into a zigzag or a straight line, as the      case may be. When the lever, H, and the zigzag shaft, F, <i>and      the connecting-bar, m</i>, and their several connected and      operative parts, are in the positions shown by the <i>full</i> lines      in Figs. 1 and 3, the shoes or hoes, G, are then in a      straight line across the machine; but, when the lever, H, is      shifted into the position shown by the <i>dotted</i> lines in Fig.      3, it turns the shaft, moves the parts connected with them,      and the shoes or hoes will then stand in a zigzag line across      the machine, as shown by the <i>full</i> lines, or in what may be      termed two lines, one in advance of the other; and, <i>in order</i>      that the shoes or hoes may be thus moved into one or two      lines, and still be susceptible of being raised up      separately, or in their series capacity, their connections      and <i>the</i> attachments must all be hinged or yielding. When      there is an odd number of shoes or hoes on the machine, the      odd one should be in the rear series, in which case there      would be no necessity of locking the lever, H, when the shoes      <i>are</i> so arranged, as the greater resistance on the greater      number would always keep them so. But, if an even number of      shoes be used and an equal number in each row, then the lever      would have to be locked or fastened in both of its positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'It is obvious that other mechanical devices may be used for      shifting the shoes or hoes from a straight into a zigzag      line, or <i>vice versa</i>.

Now, by shifting <i>the relations of</i> these two bars, <i>and by the      means aforesaid, or by the connecting rod, m, the operator      can</i> shift the shoes <i>or hoes</i> attached to them into the      positions hereinabove described.

C. Fed. Rep. 647,) in pursuance of which an interlocutory decree was entered, in June, 1881, declaring the reissued patent to be valid, and to have been infringed as to all its claims, and awarding a recovery of profits and damages, and a perpetual injunction. On the report of a master, a final decree was entered in February, 1882, by which the plaintiffs recovered $5,689.91, as damages and costs. The defendants have appealed to this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The specification of the original patent stated the purpose of the invention to be to change the seeding shoes or hoes from a straight to a zigzag line, and <i>vice versa;</i> and also to so hang the shoes or hoes as, in addition to the shifting process, to allow the shoes or hoes to be raised all together, or any one separately. The mechanical means described in that specification for shifting the shoes are these: In the front part of the machine is a rotating shaft, with cranks on it, so arranged that the shaft does not have a straight continuous axis, but has sets of axes in different lines, alternating, so that, yokes being attached, each to two of the cranks, and each two of the chanks having axes in a different line from the line of the axes of the next two adjoining eranks, the yokes being of substantially equal length, and being connected by dragbars, at the rear ends of the drag-bars, to the shoes, a rotating motion given to the crank-shaft will shift the shoes, by moving all of them, each alternate shoe moving in an opposite direction from that in which the shoe next to it moves, and thus a space being opened or closed of double the distance through which any shoe travels. To rotate the crank-shaft, there is a cross-shaft in the rear of the machine, on the end of which is an upright lever, which extends upwards to form a handle, and has pivoted to it below a bar, which extends forward, and the forward end of which is formed into a rack, which works into a pinion on the end of the crank-shaft. By moving the lever, the rack and pinion are worked, and the crank-shaft is rotated, and the shoes are shifted. The extent of the rotating movement of the crank-shaft is about half a circle, back and forth. The original specification says that, instead of employing the crank-shaft, the shoes may be united in sets to different bars, which may be straight, both bars being united to cross-bars or heads, at their ends; and that, by shifting to these two bars, the shoes attached to them will be shifted. But there is no more specific description of mechanism for the purpose, nor any drawing of such mechanism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the defendants' machine, every alternate shoe is connected with an immovable part of the frame, and every other alternate shoe is connected with a swinging cross-bar, which hangs down so as to have a motion back and forth in the arc of a circle, by reason of its being hung in bearings in the side of the frame. A rod extends from near the middle of the width of the swinging cross-bar to the rear part of the frame, behind the line from which the shoes are suspended, which rod is supported in the center of its length, and terminates, at its rear end, in a handle, so that an operator can work it, and, by pulling it, shift simultaneously all the shoes that are attached to the swinging cross-bar. Two coiled springs are so arranged that, when the rod is pulled, the springs are compressed, and, when the rod is released, the action of the springs tends to throw the swinging cross-bar and the shoes attached to it towards the front of the frame again, restoring them to the position from which the pulling of the rod moved them. Thus, only alternate shoes are shifted, but the positions of the toes of the shoes, relatively to each other, can be simultaneously changed, and a wider space, in a straight line, be opened between any two toes at any time. The shoes are so set that their toes are never in a straight line across, but, when nearest to each other, are somewhat out of a straight line, and the pulling of the rod causes the distance between them to increase. The shoes which move in increasing such distance do so through the rotating motion to and fro of the swinging cross-bar to which they are attached, such motion being imparted by the pulling, at the rear of the machine, of the rod attached to the swinging cross-bar. In the plaintiff's machine, the shoes which move, in increasing such distance, do so through the rotating motion to and fro of the crank-shaft to which they are attached, such motion being imparted by the pushing at the rear of the machine of the rod that carries the rack, the rod being worked by a lever.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An examination of the claims of the original and reissued patents shows that claim 2 of the reissue is substantially the same as claim 1 of the original; that claim 4 of the reissue is substantially the same as claim 2 of the original; and that claim 5 of the reissue is substantially the same as claim 3 of the original.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circuit court held that claim 2 of the reissue was infringed, although in the defendants' machine there is no lever such as the lever, H, of the patent, and no equivalent or substitute for it. The view taken was that claim 2 was infringed, because the defendants use a rod, the end of which is pushed and pulled by the hand of the operator, while in the patent the lever, H, pulls and pushes the end the rod. But the lever, or its equivalent, as a mechanical instrument, is made an essential element in claim 2; and dispensing with the lever, and using instead the human hand, is not the use of an equivalent, although in the plaintiff's machine the hand is applied to work the lever. <i>Water Meter Co.</i> v. <i>Desper</i>, 101 U.

During the winter of 1861-62, and the spring of 1862, Powers was selling, at Madison, grain-drills with iron dragbars. During the season of 1862, noticing the working of drills in the field, he conceived the idea that the shoes could be put into single and double ranks by a more easy method than that then used. He worked out a plan, and made a model of it, and applied for a patent November 10, 1862. The patent was ordered to issue December 6, 1862, but was never issued. The reason is not stated. The specification filed states that the 'invention consists of a device to enable the shovels or plows of a drill to be set in single or double rows or ranks, with greater ease and facility than hitherto.' The method described and shown in the drawings is to have a cross-row of stationary shovels; and a cross-row of other shovels, attached to a cross-bar, which is arranged, at each end of it, so as to slide to the extent of eight inches to and fro, in a groove. Thus, two rows may be made, or the sliding cross-bar may be set at a point where all the shovels will be in a line, and one row be formed The movable cross-bar is moved by hand, and secured, when set, by bolts. The claim covers 'the method of double and single ranking the drill teeth, by the adjustment of the sliding cross-bar, A, to which are attached the alternate drill teeth or shovels, to different positions between the side pieces of the frame.' The description states that, 'by this device, double or single ranking can be effected in a moment, instead of the more tedious process of other similar machines,' and that 'double and single ranking is a highly important feature in a drill, to adapt it to different soils and circumstances.' Powers put this shifting arrangement 'onto two, or may be three, drills' which he had on hand. He testifies to the use of two of them, and says they worked perfectly, so far as changing the rank of the drill was concerned. This was a completed invention. The idea of changing the relative positions of the shoes by having one row of them stationary and moving the other, which is the idea developed in the defendants' machine, was fully embodied in powers' machine. It had no lever and rod to do the work of the hand in moving the sliding cross-bar, and that cross-bar was held in position, when set, by bolts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of this invention of Powers, we are of opinion that the invention of the Davis patent must be limited, so far as the shifting apparatus is concerned, to the special arrangement of the rotating crank-shaft described, and shown in the drawings. The words 'substantially as described,' found in each of the first two claims of the original patent, properly confined those claims to the shifting mechanism described. If claim 1 of the reissue is given a construction which includes any arrangement for shifting not substantially using a rotating crank-shaft, it becomes a claim which could not lawfully have been granted in the original patent; and, as a claim in a reissued patent, it is invalid, within the defenses set up in the answer, because the application for the reissue was made nearly 11 years after the original patent was granted, and after machines effecting the shifting by other means than a rotating crank-shaft had gone into use subsequently to the date of the original patent, and no sufficient excuse is given for the laches and delay. The same remarks apply to claim 3 of the reissue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the rulings of this court on the subject of reissued patents, made since the decision in this case was made by the court below, in May, 1881, this case must be considered in view of the fact that the new matter introduced into the specification of the reissue was put in for the purpose of reaching machines which the claims of the original patent would not reach, and of laying a foundation for claims 1 and 3 of the reissue. The inventor and patentee, Davis, distinctly says this in his testimony. The principal interpolation is in these words: 'The rack-bar or connecting-rod, <i>m</i>, may be used for this purpose, and thereby the shoes or hoes may be shifted from a straight to a zigzag line, or <i>vice versa;</i> said connecting-bar, <i>m</i>, being held in position, if desired, by any of the usual mechanical devices for that purpose.' In the original specification, <i>m</i> is called a 'rack-bar,' because it is pivoted at one end to the lower end of the lever, H, and has on its other end a rack TAKING INTO A PINION ON THE END OF THE CRank-shaft. but, in the reissue <i>m</i> is called 'a rack-bar or connecting-rod.' Again, in the reissue, the reference to the lever, H, as connected with and working the chain to be used with the sheave or wheel, in the second suggested alternative means of shifting, is erased, so as not to make the use of the lever, H, necessary. Before these changes, the defendants' machine, which has no lever and no rotating crank-shaft, would not have been within the scope of the original claims, but, if the rack-bar were to become a connecting rod, it was thought it might cover the rod in the defendants' machine. Claim 3 of the reissue was framed on this view of shifting by a rod alone, while claim 1 is made so broad as to seem to claim shifting by any means, by a single movement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to claims 4, 5, and 6 of the reissue, the shifting mechanism of the patent, with its rotating crank-shaft, must, in view of the Powers invention, be considered as an element in each claim; and that mechanism is not used by the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It follows, from these views, that the decree of the circuit court must be reversed, and the case remanded, with a direction to dismiss the bill, with costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> S.
