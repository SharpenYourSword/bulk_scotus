Head</i> and <i>Mr. S.A. Champion</i> for plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p><i>Mr. Edward Baxter</i> for defendant in error.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*145</span> MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court. After stating the facts as above reported, he continued:</p>\n<p>The question whether the capital stock of the Nashville and Decatur Company is entitled to the same exemption as that of the Nashville and Chattanooga Company depends, 1, on whether the grant to the Tennessee and Alabama Company of \"all the rights, powers and privileges,\" and to the Central Southern Company of \"all the powers and privileges\" of the Nashville and Chattanooga Company, carried with it to the new companies the exemption from taxation provided for in section 38 of the Nashville and Chattanooga charter, and, if it did, 2, whether the Nashville and Decatur Company and its stockholders are entitled to the same exemptions as the original Tennessee corporations and their stockholders had.</p>\n<p>As early as 1850, before either the charter of the Tennessee and Alabama Company or that of the Central Southern Company was granted, this court said in <i>Philadelphia, Wilmington &amp; Baltimore Railroad Co.</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> 10 How. 376, 393, speaking by Mr. Chief Justice Taney, that a statute which authorized the union of two railroad companies, and secured to the united company the \"property, rights and privileges which that law, or other laws, conferred on them [the separate companies], or either of them,\" extended to the united company an exemption from taxation in the charter of one of the uniting companies, and this although it was at the same time said that \"the taxing power of a State is never presumed to be relinquished, unless the intention to relinquish is declared in clear and unambiguous terms.\" This has been expressly reaffirmed in <i>Tomlinson</i> v. <i>Branch,</i> 15 Wall. 460; <i>Humphrey</i> v. <i>Pegues,</i> 16 Wall. 244; <i>Southwestern Railroad</i> v. <i>Georgia,</i> 92 U.S. 676; and the correctness of the decision was recognized in <i>Central Railroad &amp; Banking Co.</i> v. <i>Georgia,</i> 92 U.S. 665; <i>Morgan</i> v. <i>Louisiana,</i> 93 U.S. 217; <i>Railroad Companies</i> v. <i>Gaines,</i> 97 U.S. 697, 711; <i>Railroad Co.</i> v. <i>Georgia,</i> 98 U.S. 359, 360; <i>Railroad Co.</i> v. <i>Hamblen,</i> 102 U.S. 273, 277; <i>Railroad Co.</i> v. <i>Commissioners,</i> 103 U.S. 1, 4; <i>Wilson</i> v. <i>Gaines,</i> 103 U.S. 417; <i>Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Co.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*146</span> v. <i>Palmes,</i> 109 U.S. 244, 253; and <i>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railroad Co.</i> v. <i>Miller,</i> 114 U.S. 176, 185.</p>\n<p>From this it is clear that, under the settled rule of decision in this court, the exemption from taxation, which was one of the \"rights and privileges\" of the Nashville and Chattanooga Company, formed part of the charters of the Tennessee and Alabama Company and the Central Southern Company, unless a different rule is to be applied in Tennessee, because of a supposed limitation on the popular meaning of the words \"rights,\" \"powers\" and \"privileges\" when used in statutes, on account of a peculiar provision of the constitution of that State. That constitutional provision is as follows:</p>\n<p>\"The legislature shall have no power ... to pass any law granting to any individual or individuals rights, privileges, immunities, or exemptions other than such as may be by the same law extended to any member of the community who may be able to bring himself within the provisions of such law: <i>Provided, always,</i> that the legislature shall have power to grant such charters of corporations as they may deem expedient for the public good.\" Constitution 1834, Art. XI, sec. 7.</p>\n<p>In view of this the Supreme Court of Tennessee decided in effect, at its December Term, 1877, in <i>Wilson</i> v. <i>Gaines,</i> 9 Baxter, 546, that as the State in its constitution used in the same connection all the words \"rights,\" \"privileges,\" \"immunities,\" and \"exemptions,\" each of these words must be given in statutory interpretation a meaning so limited as not to include anything expressed by the others, and that when any one of them is found in a statute the legislature must be conclusively presumed to have used it in this restricted sense. To this we are unable to agree. As has already been seen, the word \"privilege,\" in its ordinary meaning, when used in this connection, includes an exemption from taxation. This court so decided a year before the charter of the Tennessee and Alabama Company was granted, and nearly three years before that of the Central Southern. In fact the Supreme Court of Tennessee does not seem to doubt that such would be its meaning but for the constitution, for in the opinion it is said, \"However comprehensive a meaning may have been given the word `privilege' by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*147</span> the courts of other States, or by lexicographers, we are constrained to use it in the restricted sense and meaning given it by our laws and the constitution of the State... . A legislature acting under this constitution for its powers, and as defining its duties, must be conclusively presumed to have used a word or term of the constitution in the sense and with the meaning given it by that constitution.\" We see nothing in the constitution which gives to the word \"right,\" or \"privilege,\" or \"immunity,\" or \"exemption,\" any different meaning than that which it has among the people at large. There may be, and probably are, some immunities, and some exemptions, which would not be considered as either rights or privileges in the popular acceptation of those terms. It was to reach such immunities and such exemptions, as it seems to us, that this particular form of expression was used in the constitution, and not to provide that under no circumstances should the word privilege in a statute of Tennessee be held to include a privilege of exemption from taxation. Words in a constitution, as well as words in a statute, are always to be given the meaning they have in common use, unless there are very strong reasons to the contrary. We find no such reasons in this case, and, as an exemption from taxation is a privilege in the popular sense of that term, we feel ourselves compelled to decide that both the Tennessee and Alabama Company and the Central Southern Company were granted such an exemption by their charters, notwithstanding the contrary opinion of the Supreme Court of Tennessee, which, although entitled to great respect, is not binding upon us as authority under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p>It only remains to consider whether the Nashville and Decatur Company is entitled to the same exemption. When two railroad companies unite or become consolidated under the authority of law, the presumption is, until the contrary appears, that the united or consolidated company has all the powers and privileges, and is subject to all the restrictions and liabilities, of those out of which it was created. <i>Tomlinson</i> v. <i>Branch,</i> 15 Wall. 460; <i>Branch</i> v. <i>Charleston,</i> 92 U.S. 677, 682; <i>County of Scotland</i> v. <i>Thomas,</i> 94 U.S. 682, 690; <i>Railroad Co.</i> v. <i>Maine,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*148</span> 96 U.S. 499, 512; <i>Green County</i> v. <i>Conness,</i> 109 U.S. 104. From this it follows, that, as the capital stock of both the original Tennessee corporations was exempt from taxation, the capital stock of the united or consolidated company, formed by the simple aggregation of that of the two old ones, is also exempt, unless it has been provided to the contrary. Is there, then, anything in the statute authorizing the union which rebuts this presumption? We think there is not. The language relied on to show the contrary intention is this: \"That the said Nashville and Decatur Railroad shall, for its government, be entitled to all the powers and privileges, and be subject to all the restrictions and liabilities, conferred and imposed upon the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad Company.\" This is the exact language of the corresponding provision in the charter of the Tennessee and Alabama Company, one of the original companies, save only that the words \"for its government\" have been added. As we hold that this was sufficient to exempt the capital stock of the original companies from taxation, it follows that the new company is also exempt, unless the added words were intended as a limitation upon the effect of the others.</p>\n<p>The rule is imperative that a relinquishment of the taxing power is never to be presumed. <i>Vicksburg, Shreveport &amp; Pacific Railroad</i> v. <i>Dennis,</i> 116 U.S. 665. Under this rule, it was held in <i>Railroad Companies</i> v. <i>Gaines,</i> 97 U.S. 711, that the capital stock of the Knoxville and Charleston Railroad Company was not exempt from taxation, although by its charter that company was (p. 702) \"invested, for the purpose of making and using said road, with all the powers, rights, and privileges, and subject to all the disabilities and restrictions that have been conferred and imposed upon the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad Company,\" because (p. 712) \"the grant was not of all the rights and privileges of the Nashville and Chattanooga Company, but of such as were necessary for the purpose of making and using the road, or, in other words, the franchises of the company which do not include immunity from taxation.\" To the same effect is <i>Railroad Co.</i> v. <i>Commissioners,</i> 103 U.S. 1, where the Annapolis and Elk Ridge Railroad <span class=\"star-pagination\">*149</span> Company was \"invested with all the rights and powers necessary for the construction and repair\" of its railroad, and for that purpose was to have and use all the powers and privileges, and be subject to all the obligations contained in the enumerated sections of the Baltimore and Ohio charter. This we held \"was not a grant of all the powers and privileges of the Baltimore and Ohio Company, ... but only of such as were necessary to carry into effect the objects for which the new company was incorporated,\" or, in other words, \"such as were necessary to the construction, repair, and use of its railroad,\" and this did not include the privilege of exemption from taxation.</p>\n<p>In all this class of cases the question is one of legislative intent, with a presumption against an intent to grant an exemption from taxation. Here there is no charter of a new corporation with power to build a new railroad. No new taxable property is created. The legislation contemplates nothing more than the making of one railroad corporation out of two old ones, each of which has a completed railroad and the privilege of an exemption of its capital stock from taxation. If nothing at all had been said about the powers and privileges of the new corporation, the presumption would have been that it took all which were possessed by the two original companies at the time of their union. To rebut this presumption it is necessary that a contrary intention should appear. The question is not as to a grant of new powers, but as to the taking away of old ones.</p>\n<p>Such being the case, we cannot believe that the phrase \"for its government\" in the consolidating act was intended as a limitation on the powers and privileges of the new corporation. The natural meaning of the word government in such a connection is regulation and control, and we think it was used in that sense here. In reality it neither adds to nor takes from the force of the other words, and simply implies that the new corporation shall have the same charter rights and privileges, and be subject to the same charter restrictions and liabilities, as the Nashville and Chattanooga Company. Such were the charters of the old companies, and such was intended to be the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*150</span> charter of the new; no more, no less. As was said in the court below, \"the government of the corporation embraces every part of the conduct and business of the company in all its relations to the State, to the general public, to individuals, to its own stockholders,\" and consequently the grant of powers and privileges for its government was in reality the grant of the powers and privileges of its corporate entity.</p>\n<p>The fact that the Tennessee and Alabama Central Company was under the authority of the consolidating statute brought into the consolidated company does not in our opinion alter the case in any material respect. No new taxable property was in fact brought into Tennessee in this way. While it added to the amount of the capital stock of the consolidated company, it was only because of capital actually invested before the consolidation in the Alabama railroad, and, taking the whole statute together, it is apparent to us that the legislature intended to give the new corporation in Tennessee all the powers and privileges, including exemption from taxation, which the old corporations were entitled to. In fact we do not understand it is claimed that the rights of the parties, in respect to the present question, are changed because the two original Tennessee companies, after their union, were consolidated with the Alabama corporation.</p>\n<p>We conclude, therefore, that the capital stock of the Nashville and Decatur Company is exempt from taxation in Tennessee, and consequently, for the reasons stated in the other case, that the shares cannot be assessed. The judgment of the court below to that effect is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>",

Whitworth, the trustee and tax collector of that county, to require him to assess for taxation the shares of stock in the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railroad Company. After the suit had been begun in the state court it was removed by Whitworth to the circuit court of the United States for the Middle district of Tennessee, under the act of March 3, 1875, <i>c.</i> 137, (18 St. 470,) on the ground that the suit was one arising under the constitution of the United States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case is as follows: The Nashville &amp; Chattanooga Railroad Company, now, by consolidation with the Nashville &amp; Northwestern Railroad Company and a change of name, the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railroad Company, was incorporated by the legislature of Tennessee, December 11, 1845, to build and operate a railroad. Section 38 of its charter is in these words:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Sec. 38. The capital stock of said company shall be forever exempt from taxation, and the road, with all its fixtures and appurtenances, including workshops, warehouses, and vehicles of transportation, shall be exempt from taxation for the period of twenty years from the completion of the road, and no longer.' The act incorporating the Nashville &amp; Northwestern Railroad Company contained a provision identical with this.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question is whether this provision has the effect of a contract by the state for the exemption from taxation in Tennessee of the shares of the capital stock of the corporation. The capital stock was by the charter divided into shares of $25 each, to be subscribed for on books opened for that purpose. It was also provided that as soon as the requisite number of shares had been subscribed 'the Nashville &amp; Chattanooga Railroad Company shall be regarded as formed,' and 'the said subscribers to the stock shall form a body politic and corporate in deed and in law, by the name and for the purpose' specified. Fifty cents on each share was to be paid in money at the time of subscribing. Sections 9, 12, 15, 16, and 17 are as follows: 'Sec. 9. As soon as the number of forty thousand shares shall have been subscribed, it shall be the duty of the commissioners appointed to declare the same to appoint a time for the stockholders to meet in Nashville, and give notice thereof by publication in some of the newspapers of Nashville, at which time and place the said stockholders, in person or by proxy, shall proceed to elect the directors of the company, and to enact all such regulations, rules, and by-laws as may be necessary for the government of the corporation and the transaction of its business. The persons elected directors at this meeting shall serve for such period, not exceeding one year, as the stockholders may direct; and at this meeting the stockholders shall fix on the day and place or places where the subsequent elections of directors shall be held; and such elections shall thenceforth be annually made. But if the day of annual election should pass without any election of directors, the corporation shall not be thereby dissolved, but it shall be lawful on any other day to hold and make such election in such manner as may be prescribed by a by-law of the corporation.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Sec. 12. The board of directors shall not exceed, in their contracts, the amount of the capital of the corporation, and of the funds which the company may have borrowed and placed at the disposal of the board; and in case they should do so, the president and directors who may be present at the meeting at which such contract or contracts so exceeding the amount aforesaid shall be made, shall be jointly and severally liable for the excesses, both to the contractor or contractors and the corporation: provided, that any one may discharge himself from such liability by voting against such contract or contracts, and causing such vote to be recorded on the minutes of the board, and giving notice thereof to the next general meeting of the stockholders.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Sec. 15. The board of directors may call for the payment of twenty-four and a half dollars on each share of stock, in sums not exceeding two dollars in every thirty days: provided, that twenty days' notice be given of such call in at least one public newspaper of the state in which any of the stockholders may reside; and a failure to pay, or secure to be paid, according to the rules of the company, any of the installments so called, as aforesaid, shall induce a forfeiture of the share or shares on which default shall be so made, and all payments thereon, and the same shall vest in and belong to the company, and may be restored to the owner or owners by the board of directors, if they deem proper, on the payment of all arrears on such shares, and legal interest thereon; or the directors may waive the forfeiture after thirty days' default, and sue the stockholders for the installments due, at their discretion.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Sec. 16. The stock of said company may be transferred in such manner and form as may be directed by the by-laws of the said corporation.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Sec. 17. The said company may at any time increase its capital to a sum sufficient to complete the said road, and stock it with everything necessary to give it full operation and effect, either by opening books for new stock, or by selling such new stock, or by borrowing money on the credit of the company, and on the mortgage of its charter and works; and the manner in which the same shall be done in either case shall be prescribed by the stockholders at a general meeting; and any state, or any citizen, corporation, or company of this or any other state or country, may subscribe for and hold stock in said company, with all the rights and subject to all the liabilities of any other stockholder.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the twenty-first of January, 1848, but before the corporation was organized by the election of directors, the charter was amended as follows:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Sec. 3. Be it enacted, that the charter of the company be further so amended that the said company be required to estimate and pay semi-annually to the several holders thereof a sum equal to six per cent. per annum on the capital stock of said company actually paid in, to be charged to the cost of construction: provided, a majority of the stockholders at their first regular meeting agree thereto.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circuit court was of opinion that the shares of stock were by the charter exempt from taxation, and gave judgment accordingly. To reverse that judgment this writ of error was brought.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>S. Watson, J. B. Heiskell</i>, and <i>Jas. M. Head</i>, for plaintiff in error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Argument of Counsel from pages 133-135 intentionally omitted]</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>E. H. East</i>, for defendant in error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WAITE, C. J.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is apparent from the charter that the subscribers of shares and those claiming under them were to be the holders of the stock of the corporation, and that the money paid into the treasury upon subscriptions was to be used by the corporation in building and equipping its railroad. In this way the capital of the corporation was to be converted into the railroad and its appurtenances. A tax upon the railroad, therefore, after its completion, is necessarily a tax upon the capital, because, practically, the capital and that into which it has been converted are the same. The railroad of the corporation may be worth more than its capital, but all its capital is in its railroad. Such being the case, the taxation of both railroad and capital would be, so far as the corporation is concerned, double taxation. In <i>Railroad Cos.</i> v. <i>Gaines</i>, 97 U. S. 697, it was held that a provision in the charter of the Memphis &amp; Charleston Railroad Company, precisely like that now under consideration, did not exempt the railroad of that corporation and its appurtenances from taxation after 20 years from the time of its completion, even though the capital stock of the corporation had all been invested in the railroad, because, taking the whole section together, it was apparent such was not the intention of the legislature. The property was taxable, but the capital stock was exempt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is no doubt true that the legislature may make a difference, for the purposes of taxation, between the capital stock of a corporation in the hands of the corporation itself and the shares of the same capital stock in the hands of the individual stockholders. That has often been done, and the cases are numerous where the exemption of shares from taxation has been claimed because of a charter exemption of the capital stock. Notably this was the case with the national banks. The capital stock of such banks invested in United States securities is not taxable by the states, but shares of the stock in the hands of the individual stockholders may be taxed without deduction on account of such an investment. This has been held from the beginning. <i>Van Allen</i> v. <i>Assessors</i>, 3 Wall. 573; <i>Bradley</i> v. <i>People</i>, 4 Wall. 462; <i>People</i> v. <i>Commissioners</i>, Id. 244; <i>Lionberger</i> v. <i>Rouise</i>, 9 Wall. 468. The capital stock in the hands of the bank is exempt because invested in securities which are not to be taxed, (Rev. St. &#167; 3701,) but the shares in the hands of the stockholders are, by the very terms of the banking act, put, for the purposes of state taxation, on the same footing as other moneyed capital. Rev. St. &#167; 5219. This, it was said, showed the intention of congress to exempt the bank for what was invested in government securities, but to charge the stockholder. In <i>Farrington</i> v. <i>Tennessee</i>, 95 U. S. 679, the charter of the Union &amp; Planters' Bank provided that 'said company shall pay to the state an annual tax of one-half of one per cent. on each share of the capital stock subscribed, which shall be in lieu of all other taxes,' and the question was whether this exempted the shares in the hands of the stockholders from any further taxation by the state. The court, three justices dissenting, held that it did, because, as the charter tax was laid on each share subscribed, the further exemption must necessarily have been of the shares in the hands of the holders, although the tax as imposed was payable by the corporation. In all cases of this kind the question is as to the intent of the legislature, the presumption always being against any surrender of the taxing power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In corporations four elements of taxable value are sometimes found: (1) Franchises; (2) capital stock in the hands of the corporation; (3) corporate property; and (4) shares of the capital stock in the hands of the individual stockholders. Each of these is, under some circumstances, an appropriate subject of taxation, and it is no doubt within the power of a state, when not restrained by constitutional limitations, to assess taxes upon them in a way to subject the corporation or the stockholders to double taxation. Double taxation is, however, never to be presumed. Justice requires that the burdens of government shall, as far as is practicable, be laid equally on all, and if property is taxed once in one way, it would ordinarily be wrong to tax it again in another way, when the burden of both taxes falls on the same person. Sometimes tax laws have that effect, but if they do it is because the legislature has unmistakably so enacted. All presumptions are against such an imposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to an examination of the present charter to see what the legislature has expressed its intention of doing. 'The capital stock of said company' is exempt from taxation. That has been expressly enacted, and the owner or owners of the stock are necessarily relieved from all taxation on this account. The important question is, therefore, who are the owners of the capital stock of this corporation within the meaning of the term 'capital stock' as used in this charter because, in construing statutes which are binding on states as contracts, the words employed are, if possible, to be given the same meaning they had in the minds of the parties to the contract when the statute was enacted. In this respect there is no difference between a contract of a state and a contract of a natural person. If the words employed are capable of more than one meaning, that meaning is to be given them which, taking the whole statute together, it is apparent the parties intended they should have.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Returning to the charter, we find that the 'capital stock' is divided into shares. These shares are to be subscribed and paid for, and the money raised in this was constitutes the 'capital' of the corporation spoken of in section 12, where it said: 'The board of directors shall not exceed in their contracts the amount of the capital of the corporation,' etc.; and in section 17, where it is provided 'that said company may at any time increase its capital to a sum sufficient to complete the said road.' This capital is to be used by the corporation to build and equip its road, and if more capital is needed for that purpose it may be raised 'by opening books for new stock, or by selling such new stock. The manner of doing this may 'be prescribed by the stockholders at a general meeting; and any state, or any citizen, corporation, or company, * * * may subscribe for and hold stock in the said company, with all the rights and subject to all the liabilities of any other stockholder.' Section 17. Payments of subscriptions are to be made on each share of stock, and if default is made in a payment when demanded, 'the share or shares on which default shall be so made, and all payments thereon,' are forfeited, 'and the same shall vest in and belong to the company;' but the board of directors may, if they deem proper, restore them to the 'owner or owners,' 'on payment of all arrears on such shares, and the legal interest thereon.' Section 15. So, too, 'the stock of said company may be transferred in such manner and form as may be directed by the by-laws of the corporation,' (section 16;) and, under the amending act of 1848, interest was to be paid semi-annually, at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, 'to the several holders thereof, * * * on the capital stock of said company actually paid.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this it is clear to us that while the money paid in by the subscribers of the shares of the capital stock of the corporation constituted the capital of the corporation which was to be used in building and equipping the railroad, the stock created by such subscription and payment was to belong to and remain as the property of the several holders of the shares so subscribed and paid for. As was shown in <i>Railroad Cos.</i> v. <i>Gaines</i>, above cited, the words 'capital stock of said company,' and the words 'the road, with all its fixtures and appurtenances,' were used in the charter to describe different things. The 'capital,' which upon the payment by the subscribers belonged to the corporation, has been converted into the railroad and its appurtenances, and it had no separate existence as a taxable thing after the road was built and equipped. But the 'capital stock,' divided into shares, subscribed and paid for by the persons to whom the shares were originally issued, still has, and was by the charter intended to have, an existence separate and distinct from the property into which the money paid for it has been converted. It can now be bought, sold, and transferred. Its holders and owners are the owners of the corporation. They may meet and elect directors, who are to manage its affairs. The profits of the corporation are to be divided among them in proportion 'to the stock each may hold,' (section 30,) and upon the dissolution of the corporation they will be entitled to receive in like proportion the proceeds of what remains of the corporate property after all the corporation debts and liabilities are paid or satisfied. In effect the contributions of subscribers of the shares were stocked as the capital of the corporation. The aggregate of the subscriptions made the aggregate of the stock. Each subscriber owned that part of the stock which his shares represented, and the aggregate of the shares represented the aggregate of the stock. It was evidently called the 'capital stock of the company' because it was the stock which, when subscribed and paid for, furnished the corporation with the capital to build its road. As capital it belonged to the corporation, but as stock it belonged to the several holders of the shares into which it was divided. The charter exempted the stock from taxation clearly because the property which represented the stock had been put in its place as a taxable thing. The exemption is of the thing called the 'capital stock' divided into shares. As the whole thing is exempt, so must necessarily be its several parts or shares. It follows that the judgment of the circuit court was righ, and it is consequently affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> S.
