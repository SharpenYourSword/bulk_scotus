The work was well done; but the adoption and carrying out of the plan was held to be an act of negligence.\" But this was clearly a mistake; for in the <i>Rochester Case</i> the fact was distinctly found that the insufficiency of the culvert to carry off the water was owing, not merely to the smallness of its size, but to \"the want of skill in its construction;\" 3 N.Y. 465; and the case was distinguished on that ground in <i>Mills</i> v. <i>Brooklyn,</i> 32 N.Y. 499. The question in judgment in <i>Barnes</i> v. <i>District of Columbia</i><i>,</i> as well as in <i>Weightman</i> v. <i>Washington,</i> 1 Black, 39, was of municipal liability, not for an injury to property by a sewer, but for a personal injury to a traveller by a want of repair in the highway, a question not now before us.

The defendant denied its liability. The plaintiff's bill of exceptions stated that he testified that at the time alleged his house and land were overflowed and injured by foul water from this sewer; that he noticed that the water in the avenue was very deep; and that he never saw or knew of any flooding or overflow of the avenue or of his property until the sewer was constructed. The rest of the bill of exceptions was as follows: 'And to sustain further the issues joined, the plaintiff put upon the stand, as his witness, Benjamin Severson, a citizen of Washington, and an engineer by profession, who testified to the Tiber sewer being two feet lower at its base than the Missouri-avenue sewer where they meet each other; and being asked by the counsel for the plaintiff what, in his opinion, the consequence would be in case of a freshet or great fall of rain, the question was objected to by the counsel of the defendant unless the counsel for the plaintiff stated his object in asking such question; and thereupon it appeared that it was asked with the view of showing by that witness that the plan on which the sewer had been constructed by the authorities of the District had not been judiciously selected; and thereupon the testimony was objected to, and the court, after argument, sustained the objection, to which ruling the plaintiff's counsel excepted.' The jury returned a verdict for the defendant, the exceptions were overruled by the court in general term, and the plaintiff sued out this writ of error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Frank T.
