Such, in the opinion of the court, was the effect of the act of June 2, 1862, (12 St. 411, <i>c.</i> 93,) now in force as sections 3744-3747, 512-515, Rev. St. An effort has been made in this case to show a contract in writing, but we agree entirely with the court of claims that the papers relied on for that purpose are nothing more in law or in fact than the preliminary <i>memoranda</i> made by the parties for use in preparing a contract for execution in the form required by law. This was never done and therefore the United States never became bound.
