That a sale which had been made of the trust property by McPherson, the trustee acting under the deed of trust, to Kendall, be set aside and a new sale ordered.</p>\n<p>2. That Kendall be required to account for rents of the trust property which had been collected by him while in possession under a power of attorney from Gordon, authorizing him to receive the rents, and, after paying expenses and certain <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> specified demands, apply the proceeds upon the debt secured by the trust; and</p>\n<p>3.

At the general term the order of the special term was reversed, the sale ratified and confirmed, and the cause remanded to the special term \"for further proceedings.\" When the case got back to the special term Kendall moved a reference to an auditor to make distribution of the proceeds of the sale, but while this motion was pending, and before anything else was done, Dainese took this appeal.</p>\n<p>From this statement it is apparent that the decree appealed from is not a final decree within the meaning of that term as used in the statute allowing appeals to this court. The litigation of the parties on the merits of the case has not been terminated. An account of the rents collected by Kendall while in possession has not been taken; and the amounts due Dainese and Kendall respectively on the notes which they severally hold have not been ascertained. All this is necessary for the purposes of the relief asked for in the bill, and the cause was sent back from the general term for further proceedings on that account. The authorities are uniform to the effect that a decree to be final for the purposes of an appeal must leave the case in such a condition that if there be an affirmance here the court below will have nothing to do but to execute the decree it has already entered. <i>Bostwick</i> v. <i>Brinkerhoff,</i> 106 U.S. 3; <i>Grant</i> v. <i>Ph\u009cnix Ins.
