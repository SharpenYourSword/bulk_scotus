In the declaration it is stated that Halsted, the plaintiff, is a citizen of New York, but nothing is said of the citizenship of the defendants. Neither is there anything in the rest of the record to show what their citizenship actually was. For this reason the judgment is reversed; but, as the fault rests alone on the plaintiff, whose duty it was, in bringing the suit, to make the jurisdiction appear, the reversal will be at his cost in thi  court. <i>Hancock</i> v. <i>Holbrook</i>, 112 U.

If the citizenship of the defendants was, in fact, such, at the commencement of the suit, as to give the circuit court jurisdiction, it will be in the power of that court, when the case gets back, to allow the necessary amendment to be made, and then proceed to trial.
