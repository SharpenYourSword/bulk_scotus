This was good practice, and, if oftener adopted, would save trouble to parties and to us. Under this leave, and others of a similar character, which were afterwards granted, a considerable number of affidavits were filed by both parties. The affidavits were contradictory, some having a tendency to prove that the value was more than five thousand dollars, and others that it was less. On the 5th of May, 1885, the district judge, without formally deciding the question of value, allowed a writ of error, thus sending the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*388</span> case here on the affidavits, free from any decision whatever by the court below as to their effect. In this respect the case differs from <i>Gage</i> v. <i>Pumpelly,</i> 108 U.S. 164, where the appeal was allowed by the court in session after considering the affidavits; and from <i>Zeigler</i> v. <i>Hopkins,</i> 117 U.S. 683, where the value was found as one of the facts in the case.</p>\n<p>The burden of showing jurisdiction is on the plaintiff in error.

Two witnesses swear that the property is worth more than six thousand dollars, and eight that it is worth five thousand dollars, \"or more.\" These are for the plaintiff in error, but there are eight on the other side who say it is worth only from about $3000 to about $3500, and the certificate of the county clerk shows that it was valued for taxation in 1884 at only seven hundred dollars. Under these circumstances, we think the decided preponderance of the evidence is against our jurisdiction, and the motion to dismiss is therefore granted.</p>\n<p><i>Dismissed.</i></p>\n</div>",
