On the sixteenth of September, 1884, on motion, leave was given the defendant in the court below to file affidavits of value that day, and the plaintiff to file counteraffidavits in 20 days. This was good practice, and, if oftener adopted, would save trouble to parties and to us. Under this leave, and others of a similar character, which were afterwards granted, a considerable number of affidavits were filed by both parties. The affidavits were contradictory, some having a tendency to prove that the value was more than $5,000, and others that it was less. On the fifth of May, 1885, the district judge, without formally deciding the question of value, allowed a writ of error, thus sending the case here on the affidavits, free from any decision whatever by the court below as to their effect. In this respect the case differs from <i>Gage</i> v. <i>Pumpelly</i>, 108 U.S. 164, S. C. 2 Sup. Ct.
