The plaintiff, without any fault of his, being unable to repay the consideration of the fraudulent transfer, equity will not require him to do so as a condition precedent to granting him relief, but will make due provision, in the final decree, for the repayment of that sum out of the property recovered. <i>Reynolds</i> v. <i>Waller,</i> 1 Wash.

The complaint concluded by praying judgment that the transfer to Haas be declared void, and be canceled; that the 80,000 shares of stock, and said interests therein, be adjudged to be the plaintiff's property; that so much thereof be sold by order of the court as should be sufficient to yield $1,200, and interest from the date of the transfer, and that sum be paid to Haas; that the mining company be d rected to issue the rest of those shares and interests to the plaintiff, and be restrained from issuing them to any other person; and that the other defendants restore to the plaintiff any certificates thereof in their hands, and be restrained from receiving any more, and account to him for any part that they had disposed of.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants severally demurred to the complaints, as stating no cause of action; the demurrers were sustained, and the complaint dismissed by the courts of the territory, and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>E.
