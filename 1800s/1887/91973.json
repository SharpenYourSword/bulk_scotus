Da Costa</i> for defendants in error.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*202</span> MR. JUSTICE BLATCHFORD, after stating the case as above reported, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>The two sections of the Revised Statutes upon which the United States base their right of recovery in the case are \u00a7\u00a7 2839 and 2864. Section 2839 was originally enacted as part of \u00a7 66 of the act of March 2, 1799, c. 22, 1 Stat. 677, and reads as follows: \"SEC. 2839. If any merchandise, of which entry has been made in the office of a collector, is not invoiced according to the actual cost thereof at the place of exportation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*203</span> with design to evade payment of duty, all such merchandise, or the value thereof, to be recovered of the person making entry, shall be forfeited.\"</p>\n<p>Section 2864 was originally enacted as part of \u00a7 1 of the act of March 3, 1863, c. 76, 12 Stat. 738, and reads as follows: \"SEC. 2864. If any owner, consignee, or agent of any merchandise shall knowingly make, or attempt to make, an entry thereof by means of any false invoice, or false certificate of a consul, vice-consul, or commercial agent, or of any invoice which does not contain a true statement of all the particulars hereinbefore required, or by means of any other false or fraudulent document or paper, or of any other false or fraudulent practice or appliance whatsoever, such merchandise, or the value thereof, shall be forfeited.\"</p>\n<p>The bill of exceptions contains the following statement as to the proceedings after the above ruling of the court: The plaintiffs asked leave to prove, successively, that items contained in the invoices mentioned in the complaint and bill of particulars were undervalued, within the meaning of the last clause of \u00a7 12 of the act of June 22, 1874, which reads as follows: \"Anything contained in any act which provides for the forfeiture or confiscation of an entire invoice in consequence of any item or items contained in the same being undervalued, be, and the same is hereby, repealed;\" that the defendants, being consignees of the merchandise mentioned in the complaint, knowingly made entries thereof by means of false invoices; that the defendants, being agents of the merchandise mentioned in the complaint, knowingly made entry thereof by means of false invoices; that the defendants, being consignees of the merchandise mentioned in the complaint, knowingly made entry thereof by means of invoices which did not contain a true statement of the particulars required in that part of the act of March 3, 1863, preceding the provision of the act which was re\u00ebnacted as \u00a7 2864 of the Revised Statutes; that the defendants being agents of the merchandise mentioned in the complaint, knowingly made entry thereof by means of invoices which did not contain a true statement of the particulars required in that part of the act of March 3, 1863, preceding the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*204</span> provision of the act which was re\u00ebnacted as \u00a7 2864 of the Revised Statutes; that the defendants, being the consignees of the merchandise mentioned in the complaint, knowingly made entry thereof by means of false and fraudulent documents and papers; and that the defendants, being the agents of the merchandise mentioned in the complaint, knowingly made entry thereof by means of false and fraudulent documents and papers. These requests being successively denied, the plaintiffs excepted to each refusal. The jury under direction of the court, found a verdict for the defendants, to which direction the plaintiffs excepted. After a judgment for the defendants, the plaintiffs took the case to the Circuit Court by a writ of error, where the judgment was affirmed, and they have brought the case to this court by a writ of error.</p>\n<p>The main contentions on the part of the defendants are, that \u00a7 2839 relates only to purchased goods, and not to consigned goods, and that \u00a7 2864 is superseded by \u00a7 12 of the act of June 22, 1874, c. 391, 18 Stat. 188. These contentions were sustained by the District Court in its opinion.</p>\n<p>Section 2839 provides for the forfeiture of merchandise, or the value thereof, \"to be recovered of the person making entry,\" where the merchandise is \"not invoiced according to the actual cost thereof at the place of exportation, with design to evade payment of duty.\" This section, originally enacted in 1799, is applicable only to goods which are required to be invoiced according to their actual cost at the place of exportation. <i>Alfonso</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 2 Story, 421, 429, 432. By \u00a7 2841 of the Revised Statutes, originally \u00a7 4 of the act of March 1, 1823, c. 21, 3 Stat. 730, 732, forms of oaths on the entry of goods are prescribed, one for the \"consignee, importer, or agent,\" one for the \"owner in cases where merchandise has been actually purchased,\" and a third for the \"manufacturer or owner in cases where merchandise has not been actually purchased.\" In the first form of oath, the oath is, that the invoice \"exhibits the actual cost, (if purchased,) or fair market value, (if otherwise obtained,)\" at the time and place of procurement. In the second form of oath, the oath is, that the oath contains \"a just and faithful account of the actual cost.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*205</span> In the third form of oath, the oath is, that the goods were not actually bought by the importer or consignee, or by his agent, in the ordinary mode of bargain and sale, but that nevertheless the invoice \"contains a just and faithful valuation of the same, at their fair market value\" at the place of procurement.</p>\n<p>Section 2845, originally \u00a7 8 of the act of March 1, 1823, c. 21, 3 Stat. 733, provides that \"no merchandise subject to <i>ad valorem</i> duty, belonging to a person not residing at the time in the United States, who has not acquired the same in the ordinary mode of bargain and sale, or belonging to the manufacturer, in whole or in part, of the same, shall be admitted to entry, unless the invoice thereof is verified by the oath of the owner or of one of the owners, ... certifying that the invoice contains a true and faithful account of the merchandise, at its fair market value, at the time and place when and where the same was procured or manufactured, as the case may be.\"</p>\n<p>Section 2854, originally a part of \u00a7 1 of the act of March 3, 1863, c. 76, 12 Stat. 737, provides as follows: \"All such invoices\" (that is, all invoices of merchandise imported from any foreign country) \"shall, at or before the shipment of the merchandise, be produced to the consul, vice-consul, or commercial agent of the United States nearest the place of shipment, for the use of the United States, and shall have indorsed thereon, when so produced, a declaration signed by the purchaser, manufacturer, owner, or agent, setting forth that the invoice is in all respects true; that it contains, if the merchandise mentioned therein is subject to <i>ad valorem</i> duty, and was obtained by purchase, a true and full statement of the time when and the place where the same was purchased, and the actual cost thereof, and of all charges thereon; and that no discounts, bounties, or drawbacks are contained in the invoice but such as have actually been allowed thereon; and when obtained in any other manner than by purchase, the actual market value thereof at the time and place when and where the same was procured or manufactured; and, if subject to specific duty, the actual quantity thereof; and that no different invoice of the merchandise, mentioned in the invoice so produced, has been or will be furnished to any one. If the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*206</span> merchandise was actually purchased, the declaration shall also contain a statement that the currency in which such invoice is made out is the currency which was actually paid for the merchandise by the purchaser.\"</p>\n<p>It is quite clear, from the above provisions, that, where imported goods are the property of their manufacturer, the invoice need only state the fair market value of the goods at the place of manufacture, and it need not state \"the actual cost thereof at the place of exportation.\" Therefore, an invoice of goods which belong to their manufacturer is not, nor is an entry of such goods, within the purview of \u00a7 2839, so as to make the person entering them with design to evade payment of duty liable to a forfeiture of their value.</p>\n<p>The most serious question arises in respect to \u00a7 2864, which is alleged to have been superseded by \u00a7 12 of the act of June 22, 1874. The two statutes are here placed in parallel columns:</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n  <i>Section 2864, Revised Statutes,</i>        <i>Section 12 of the Act of June</i>\n             <i>(2d ed).</i>                               <i>22, 1874.</i>\n    \"If any owner, consignee, or          \"That any owner, importer,\n  agent of any merchandise shall        consignee, agent, or other person\n  knowingly make, or attempt            who shall, with intent to\n  to make, an entry thereof by          defraud the revenue, make, or\n  means of any false invoice, or        attempt to make, any entry\n  false certificate of a consul,        of imported merchandise, by\n  vice-consul, or commercial            means of any fraudulent or\n  agent, or of any invoice which        false invoice, affidavit, letter,\n  does not contain a true statement     or paper, or by means of any\n  of all the particulars                false statement, written or\n  hereinbefore required, or by          verbal, or who shall be guilty\n  means of any other false or           of any wilful act or omission\n  fraudulent document or paper,         by means whereof the United\n  or of any other false or fraudulent   States shall be deprived of the\n  practice or appliance                 lawful duties, or any portion\n  whatsoever, such merchandise          thereof, accruing upon the merchandise,\n  or the value thereof shall be         or any portion thereof,\n  forfeited.\"                           embraced or referred to in\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*207</span>\n                                        such invoice, affidavit, letter,\n                                        paper, or statement, or affected\n                                        by such act or omission, shall,\n                                        for each offence, be fined in any\n                                        sum not exceeding five thousand\n                                        dollars nor less than fifty\n                                        dollars, or be imprisoned for\n                                        any time not exceeding two\n                                        years, or both; and, in addition\n                                        to such fine, such merchandise\n                                        shall be forfeited; which forfeiture\n                                        shall only apply to the\n                                        whole of the merchandise in\n                                        the case or package containing\n                                        the particular article or articles\n                                        of merchandise to which said\n                                        fraud or alleged fraud relates;\n                                        and anything contained in any\n                                        act which provides for the forfeiture\n                                        or confiscation of an\n                                        entire invoice in consequence\n                                        of any item or items contained\n                                        in the same being undervalued,\n                                        be, and the same is\n                                        hereby, repealed.\"\n</pre>\n<p>Assuming that the language of \u00a7 2864, declaring that the merchandise or its value shall be forfeited, would authorize a suit <i>in personam,</i> without a seizure of the merchandise, and also assuming that the suit for a forfeiture of the value may be brought against the owner, consignee, or agent, the question for determination is, whether the provision in \u00a7 2864, for a forfeiture of the value, is superseded by the enactment of \u00a7 12 of the act of June 22, 1874, which provides only for a forfeiture of the merchandise, and does not provide for any forfeiture of its value.</p>\n<p>Section 13 of the act of June 22, 1874, provides that any merchandise entered by any person violating \u00a7 12, but not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*208</span> subject to forfeiture under that section, may, while owned by him or while in his possession, \"to double the amount claimed, be taken by the collector and held as security for the payment of any fine or fines incurred as aforesaid.\" Section 14 provides that the omission, without intent thereby to defraud the revenue, to add, on entry, to the invoice, certain specified charges, shall not be a cause of forfeiture of the goods \"or of the value thereof.\" Section 16 provides that, in suits to enforce the forfeiture of goods, \"or to recover the value thereof,\" no fine, penalty, or forfeiture shall be imposed unless the jury shall find that the alleged acts were done with an actual intention to defraud the United States. Section 26 repeals all acts and parts of acts inconsistent with the provisions of that act. There is not in the act any other repealing provision, except that contained in the concluding words of \u00a7 12, above quoted.</p>\n<p>The act of June 22, 1874, was passed on the same day with the Revised Statutes, \u00a7 5595 of which declares that the Revised Statutes embrace the general and permanent statutes of the United States which were in force on the 1st day of December, 1873. Section 5601 declares that the enactment of the revision is not to affect or repeal any act of Congress passed since the 1st day of December, 1873; that all acts passed since that date are to have full effect, as if passed after the enactment of the revision; and that, so far as such acts vary from or conflict with any provision contained in the revision, they are to have effect as subsequent statutes, and as repealing any portion of the revision inconsistent therewith. The act of June 22, 1874, is, therefore, a subsequent statute to the Revised Statutes, and repeals any portion thereof which is inconsistent with such subsequent statute.</p>\n<p>On a full review of the above-recited provisions of the act of June 22, 1874, and of its other provisions, it is apparent that, so far, at least, as the acts subject to the penalties denounced in \u00a7 2864 are concerned, they are entirely covered by the provisions of \u00a7 12 of the act of June 22, 1874. There is no act denounced by \u00a7 2864 that is not embraced, both as to person and character of act, by the provisions of \u00a7 12. The latter section adds, as a punishment for the offence, fine or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*209</span> imprisonment, or both, and a forfeiture of the merchandise, in addition to the fine. It leaves out a forfeiture of the value of the merchandise, and forfeiture of such value is inconsistent with the terms of \u00a7 12, and is, therefore, repealed by it. The absolute forfeiture of the merchandise, provided for by \u00a7 12, is inconsistent, also, with the alternative forfeiture of the merchandise or its value, provided for by \u00a7 2864. The provisions of the two statutes cannot stand together. <i>Norris</i> v. <i>Crocker,</i> 13 How. 429, 438; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Tynen,</i> 11 Wall. 88, 92; <i>Murdoch</i> v. <i>City of Memphis,</i> 20 Wall. 590, 617; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Claflin,</i> 97 U.S. 546, 552, 553; <i>King</i> v. <i>Cornell,</i> 106 U.S. 395, 396; <i>Pana</i> v. <i>Bowler,</i> 107 U.S. 529, 538.</p>\n<p>The considerations covered by the foregoing views are so well discussed and enforced in the opinion of the District Judge in this case that it is not deemed necessary further to enlarge upon them.</p>\n<p>Section 2864 of the Revised Statutes, when originally enacted on the 22d of June, 1874, did not contain the words \"or the value thereof\" after the words \"such merchandise.\" By the act of February 18, 1875, c. 80, 18 Stat. 319, entitled \"An Act to correct errors and to supply omissions in the Revised Statutes of the United States,\" and which act states \"that, for the purpose of correcting errors and supplying omissions in the act entitled `An Act to revise and consolidate the statutes of the United States in force on the first day of December, Anno Domini one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three,' so as to make the same truly express such laws, the following amendments are hereby made therein,\" it is provided as follows: \"Section two thousand eight hundred and sixty-four is amended by inserting in the last line, after the word `merchandise,' the words `or the value thereof.'\" Section two of the act directs the Secretary of State, \"if practicable, to cause this act to be printed and bound in the volume of the Revised Statutes of the United States.\"</p>\n<p>It is contended for the United States that this amendment to \u00a7 2864, made by the act of February 18, 1875, can be reasonably accounted for only upon the theory that, at the date it was made, which was after the passage of the act of June <span class=\"star-pagination\">*210</span> 22, 1874, c. 391, Congress regarded \u00a7 2864, as thus amended, as a valid existing law, particularly in respect to the amendment, and intended to declare that the value of the merchandise should be forfeited under \u00a7 2864, notwithstanding the passage of the act of June 22, 1874, c. 391. But we are of opinion that the amendment made by the act of February 18, 1875, did not have the effect contended for. Its sole object was to correct errors and supply omissions in the text of the Revised Statutes, as its title indicates, so as to make the same truly express the statutes in force on the 1st of December, 1873, and it made special reference to the printed volume of the Revised Statutes. It was in no respect new legislation, nor a new law enacted to take effect from the date of its passage, in such wise as to alter any enactment made since the passage of the Revised Statutes. The intention was to make \u00a7 2864 read as it ought to have read in the printed volume, in the shape in which it was in force on the 1st of December, 1873, as a part of \u00a7 1 of the act of March 3, 1863, c. 76, 12 Stat. 738. It left the act of June 22, 1874, c. 391, to have its full effect in respect to \u00a7 2864, in like manner as if the words \"or the value thereof\" had been contained in that section, in the printed volume of the Revised Statutes. There was a law in force on December 1, 1873, and subsequently thereto, down to June 22, 1874, authorizing a forfeiture of the value of merchandise for the causes stated in \u00a7 2864, and the fact that forfeitures of such value might have been incurred during the intervening period between December 1, 1873, and June 22, 1874, was a sufficient reason for the correction made in \u00a7 2864.</p>\n<p><i>The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>",

By \u00a7 2841 of the Revised Statutes, originally \u00a7 4 of the act of March 1, 1823, c. 21, 3 Stat. 730, 732, forms of oaths on the entry of goods are prescribed, one for the \"consignee, importer, or agent,\" one for the \"owner in cases where merchandise has been actually purchased,\" and a third for the \"manufacturer or owner in cases where merchandise has not been actually purchased.\" In the first form of oath, the oath is, that the invoice \"exhibits the actual cost, (if purchased,) or fair market value, (if otherwise obtained,)\" at the time and place of procurement. In the second form of oath, the oath is, that the oath contains \"a just and faithful account of the actual cost.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*205</span> In the third form of oath, the oath is, that the goods were not actually bought by the importer or consignee, or by his agent, in the ordinary mode of bargain and sale, but that nevertheless the invoice \"contains a just and faithful valuation of the same, at their fair market value\" at the place of procurement.</p>\n<p>Section 2845, originally \u00a7 8 of the act of March 1, 1823, c. 21, 3 Stat. 733, provides that \"no merchandise subject to <i>ad valorem</i> duty, belonging to a person not residing at the time in the United States, who has not acquired the same in the ordinary mode of bargain and sale, or belonging to the manufacturer, in whole or in part, of the same, shall be admitted to entry, unless the invoice thereof is verified by the oath of the owner or of one of the owners, ... certifying that the invoice contains a true and faithful account of the merchandise, at its fair market value, at the time and place when and where the same was procured or manufactured, as the case may be.\"</p>\n<p>Section 2854, originally a part of \u00a7 1 of the act of March 3, 1863, c. 76, 12 Stat. 737, provides as follows: \"All such invoices\" (that is, all invoices of merchandise imported from any foreign country) \"shall, at or before the shipment of the merchandise, be produced to the consul, vice-consul, or commercial agent of the United States nearest the place of shipment, for the use of the United States, and shall have indorsed thereon, when so produced, a declaration signed by the purchaser, manufacturer, owner, or agent, setting forth that the invoice is in all respects true; that it contains, if the merchandise mentioned therein is subject to <i>ad valorem</i> duty, and was obtained by purchase, a true and full statement of the time when and the place where the same was purchased, and the actual cost thereof, and of all charges thereon; and that no discounts, bounties, or drawbacks are contained in the invoice but such as have actually been allowed thereon; and when obtained in any other manner than by purchase, the actual market value thereof at the time and place when and where the same was procured or manufactured; and, if subject to specific duty, the actual quantity thereof; and that no different invoice of the merchandise, mentioned in the invoice so produced, has been or will be furnished to any one. If the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*206</span> merchandise was actually purchased, the declaration shall also contain a statement that the currency in which such invoice is made out is the currency which was actually paid for the merchandise by the purchaser.\"</p>\n<p>It is quite clear, from the above provisions, that, where imported goods are the property of their manufacturer, the invoice need only state the fair market value of the goods at the place of manufacture, and it need not state \"the actual cost thereof at the place of exportation.\" Therefore, an invoice of goods which belong to their manufacturer is not, nor is an entry of such goods, within the purview of \u00a7 2839, so as to make the person entering them with design to evade payment of duty liable to a forfeiture of their value.</p>\n<p>The most serious question arises in respect to \u00a7 2864, which is alleged to have been superseded by \u00a7 12 of the act of June 22, 1874.

Section 26 repeals all acts and parts of acts inconsistent with the provisions of that act. There is not in the act any other repealing provision, except that contained in the concluding words of \u00a7 12, above quoted.</p>\n<p>The act of June 22, 1874, was passed on the same day with the Revised Statutes, \u00a7 5595 of which declares that the Revised Statutes embrace the general and permanent statutes of the United States which were in force on the 1st day of December, 1873. Section 5601 declares that the enactment of the revision is not to affect or repeal any act of Congress passed since the 1st day of December, 1873; that all acts passed since that date are to have full effect, as if passed after the enactment of the revision; and that, so far as such acts vary from or conflict with any provision contained in the revision, they are to have effect as subsequent statutes, and as repealing any portion of the revision inconsistent therewith. The act of June 22, 1874, is, therefore, a subsequent statute to the Revised Statutes, and repeals any portion thereof which is inconsistent with such subsequent statute.</p>\n<p>On a full review of the above-recited provisions of the act of June 22, 1874, and of its other provisions, it is apparent that, so far, at least, as the acts subject to the penalties denounced in \u00a7 2864 are concerned, they are entirely covered by the provisions of \u00a7 12 of the act of June 22, 1874. There is no act denounced by \u00a7 2864 that is not embraced, both as to person and character of act, by the provisions of \u00a7 12. The latter section adds, as a punishment for the offence, fine or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*209</span> imprisonment, or both, and a forfeiture of the merchandise, in addition to the fine. It leaves out a forfeiture of the value of the merchandise, and forfeiture of such value is inconsistent with the terms of \u00a7 12, and is, therefore, repealed by it. The absolute forfeiture of the merchandise, provided for by \u00a7 12, is inconsistent, also, with the alternative forfeiture of the merchandise or its value, provided for by \u00a7 2864. The provisions of the two statutes cannot stand together. <i>Norris</i> v. <i>Crocker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86752\"><a href=\"/opinion/86752/norris-v-crocker/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span>, 438; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Tynen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88305\"><a href=\"/opinion/88305/united-states-v-tynen/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span>, 92; <i>Murdoch</i> v. <i>City of Memphis,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></span>, 617; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Claflin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"89823\"><a href=\"/opinion/89823/united-states-v-claflin/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></a></span>, 552, 553; <i>King</i> v. <i>Cornell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90685\"><a href=\"/opinion/90685/king-v-cornell/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">395</span></a></span>, 396; <i>Pana</i> v. <i>Bowler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90787\"><a href=\"/opinion/90787/pana-v-bowler/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">529</span></a></span>, 538.</p>\n<p>The considerations covered by the foregoing views are so well discussed and enforced in the opinion of the District Judge in this case that it is not deemed necessary further to enlarge upon them.</p>\n<p>Section 2864 of the Revised Statutes, when originally enacted on the 22d of June, 1874, did not contain the words \"or the value thereof\" after the words \"such merchandise.\" By the act of February 18, 1875, c. 80, 18 Stat. 319, entitled \"An Act to correct errors and to supply omissions in the Revised Statutes of the United States,\" and which act states \"that, for the purpose of correcting errors and supplying omissions in the act entitled `An Act to revise and consolidate the statutes of the United States in force on the first day of December, Anno Domini one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three,' so as to make the same truly express such laws, the following amendments are hereby made therein,\" it is provided as follows: \"Section two thousand eight hundred and sixty-four is amended by inserting in the last line, after the word `merchandise,' the words `or the value thereof.'\" Section two of the act directs the Secretary of State, \"if practicable, to cause this act to be printed and bound in the volume of the Revised Statutes of the United States.\"</p>\n<p>It is contended for the United States that this amendment to \u00a7 2864, made by the act of February 18, 1875, can be reasonably accounted for only upon the theory that, at the date it was made, which was after the passage of the act of June <span class=\"star-pagination\">*210</span> 22, 1874, c. 391, Congress regarded \u00a7 2864, as thus amended, as a valid existing law, particularly in respect to the amendment, and intended to declare that the value of the merchandise should be forfeited under \u00a7 2864, notwithstanding the passage of the act of June 22, 1874, c. 391. But we are of opinion that the amendment made by the act of February 18, 1875, did not have the effect contended for. Its sole object was to correct errors and supply omissions in the text of the Revised Statutes, as its title indicates, so as to make the same truly express the statutes in force on the 1st of December, 1873, and it made special reference to the printed volume of the Revised Statutes. It was in no respect new legislation, nor a new law enacted to take effect from the date of its passage, in such wise as to alter any enactment made since the passage of the Revised Statutes. The intention was to make \u00a7 2864 read as it ought to have read in the printed volume, in the shape in which it was in force on the 1st of December, 1873, as a part of \u00a7 1 of the act of March 3, 1863, c. 76, 12 Stat. 738. It left the act of June 22, 1874, c. 391, to have its full effect in respect to \u00a7 2864, in like manner as if the words \"or the value thereof\" had been contained in that section, in the printed volume of the Revised Statutes. There was a law in force on December 1, 1873, and subsequently thereto, down to June 22, 1874, authorizing a forfeiture of the value of merchandise for the causes stated in \u00a7 2864, and the fact that forfeitures of such value might have been incurred during the intervening period between December 1, 1873, and June 22, 1874, was a sufficient reason for the correction made in \u00a7 2864.</p>\n<p><i>The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>",

Auffmordt, John F. Degener, William Degener, and Adolph William Von Kessler, composing the firm of C. A. Auffmordt &amp; Co., to recover the sum of $321,519.29, with interest. The complaint alleges violations by the defendants of statutes of the United States in respect to entries of imported merchandise made by the defendants in 1879, 1880, 1881, and 1882, the value of such merchandise being the above-named sum, and claims that, by reason of the acts of the defendants alleged in the complaint, the defendants have forfeited such value to the United States. The defendants put in an answer containing a general denial, and the case was tried in the district court before a jury.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the case was opened to the jury on the part of the United States, and before any testimony was offered, the defendants moved, upon such opening, that the court direct a verdict for the defendants, on the ground that there was no statute of the United States whereby the value of the merchandise could be recovered by reason of the acts alleged to have been committed by the defendants as consigness of the goods, which was the capacity in which they received and entered the goods, the goods being the property of the manufacturers of them in Switzerland, and being consigned to the defendants for sale on commission. The facts sought to be proved against the defendants were that they, knowingly and with intent to defraud the revenue, entered the goods at in voice prices lower than their actual market value at the time and place of exportation. The court ruled that there was no existing statute of the United States under which the plaintiff could recover upon any possible proof, and h at a verdict must be directed for the defendants. 19 Fed.

Section 2839 was originally enacted as a part of section 66 of the act of March 2, 1799, <i>c.</i> 22, (1 St. 677,) and reads as follows: 'Sec. 2839. If any merchandise of which entry has been made in the office of a collector is not invoiced according to the actual cost thereof at the place of exportation, with design to evade payment of duty, all such merchandise, or the value thereof, to be recovered of the person making entry, shall be forfeited.' Section 2864 was originally enacted as a part of section 1 of the act of March 3, 1863, <i>c.</i> 76, (12 St. 738,) and reads as follows: 'Section 2864. If any owner, consignee, or agent of any merchandise shall knowingly make, or attempt to make, an entry thereof by means of any false invoice, or false certificate of a consul, vice-consul, or commercial agent, or of any invoice which does not contain a true statement of all the particulars hereinbefore required, or by means of any other false or fraudulent document or paper, or of any other false or fraudulent practice or appliance whatsoever, such merchandise, or the value thereof, shall be forfeited.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bill of exceptions contains the following statement as to the proceedings after the above ruling of the court: The plaintiffs asked leave to prove successively that items contained in the invoices mentioned in the complaint and bill of particulars were undervalued, within the meaning of the last clause of after the above ruling of the court: which reads as follows: 'Anything contained in any act which provides for the forfeiture or confiscation of an entire invoice in consequence of any item or items contained in the same being undervalued, be, and the same is hereby, repealed;' that the defendants, being consignees of the merchandise mentioned in the complaint, knowingly made entries thereof by means of false invoices; that the defendants, being agents of the merchandise mentioned in the complaint, knowingly made entry thereof by means of false invoices; that the defendants, being consignees of the merchandise mentioned in the complaint, knowingly made entry thereof by means of invoices which did not contain a true statement of the particulars required in that part of the act of March 3, 1863, preceding the provision of the act which was re-enacted as section 2864 of the Revised Statutes; that the defendants, being agents of the merchandise mentioned in the complaint, knowingly made entry thereof by means of invoices which did not contain a true statement of the particulars required in that part of the act of March 3, 1863, preceding the provision of the act which was re-enacted as section 2864 of the Revised Statutes; that the defendants, being the consignees of the merchandise mentioned in the complaint, knowingly made entry thereof by means of false and fraudulent documents and papers; and that the defendants, being the agents of the merchandise mentioned in the complaint, knowingly made entry thereof by means of false and fraudulent documents and papers. These requests being successively denied, the plaintiffs excepted to each refusal. The jury, under direction of the court, found a verdict for the defendants, to which direction the plaintiffs excepted.

This section, originally enacted in 1799, is applicable only to goods which are required to be invoiced according to their actual cost at the place of exportation. <i>Alfonso</i> v. <i>U.S.</i>, 2 Story, 421, 429, 432. By section 2841 of the Revised Statutes, originally section 4 of the act of March 1, 1823, <i>c.</i> 21, (3 St. 730, 732,) forms of oaths on the entry of goods are prescribed, one for the 'consignee, importer, or agent,' one for the 'owner in cases where merchandise has been actually purchased,' and a third for the 'manufacturer or owner in cases where merchandise has not been actually purchased.' In the first form of oath, the oath is that the invoice 'exhibits the actual cost (if purchased) or fair market value (if otherwise obtained)' at the time and place of procurement. In the second form of oath, the oath is that the oath contains 'a just and faithful account of the actual cost.' In the third form of oath, the oath is that the goods were not actually bought by the importer or consignee, or by his agent, in the ordinary mode of bargain and sale, but that nevertheless the invoice 'contains a just and faithful valuation of the same, at their fair market value' at the place of procurement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2845, originally section 8 of the act of March 1, 1823, <i>c.</i> 21, (3 St. 733,) provides that 'no merchandise subject to <i>ad valorem</i> duty, belonging to a person not residing at the time in the United States, who has not acquired the same in the ordinary mode of bargain and sale, or belonging to the manufacturer, in whole or in part, of the same, shall be admitted to entry, unless the invoice thereof is verifed by the oath of the owner, or of one of the owners, * * * certifying that the invoice contains a true and faithful account of the merchandise at its fair market value, at the time and place when and where the same was procured or manufactured, as the case may be.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2854, originally a part of section 1 of the act of March 3, 1863, <i>c.</i> 76, (12 St. 737,) provides as follows: 'All such invoices [that is, all invoices of merchandise imported from any foreign country,] shall, at or before the shipment of the merchandise, be produced to the consul, vice-consul, or commercial agent of the United States nearest the place of shipment, for the use of the United States, and shall have indorsed thereon, when so produced, a declaration signed by the purchaser, manufacturer, owner, or agent, setting forth that the invoice is in all respects true; that it contains, if the merchandise mentioned therein is subject to <i>ad volorem</i> duty, and was obtained by purchase, a true and full statement of the time when and the place where the same was purchased, and the actual cost thereof, and of all charges thereon; and that no discounts, bounties or drawbacks are contained in the invoice but such as have actually been allowed thereon; and, when obtained in any other manner than by purchase, the actual market value thereof at the time and place when and where the same was procured or manufactured; and, if subject to specific duty, the actual quantity thereof; and that no different invoice of the merchandise mentioned in the invoice so produced has been or will be furnished to any one. If the merchandise was actually purchased, the declaration shall also contain a statement that the currency in which such invoice is made out is the currency which was actually paid for the merchandise by the purchaser.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is quite clear, from the above provisions, that, where imported goods are the property of their manufacturer, the invoice need only state the fair market value of the goods at the place of manufacture, and it need not state 'the actual cost thereof at the place of exportation.' Therefore an invoice ofg oods which belong to their manufacturer is not, nor is an entry of such goods, within the purview of section 2839, so as to make the person entering them with design to evade payment of duty liable to a forfeiture of their value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most serious question arises in respect to section 2864, which is alleged to have been superseded by section 12 of the act of June 22, 1874.

Section 14 provides that the omission, without intent thereby to defraud the revenue, to add, on entry, to the invoice, certain specified charges, shall not be a cause of forfeiture of the goods, 'or of the value thereof.' Section 16 provides that in suits to enforce the forfeiture of goods, 'or to recover the value thereof,' no fine, penalty, or forfeiture shall be imposed unless the jury shall find that the alleged acts were done with an actual intention to defraud the United States. Section 26 repeals all acts and parts of acts inconsistent with the provisions of that act. There is not in the act any other repealing provision, except that contained in the concluding words of section 12, above quoted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The act of June 22, 1874, was passe  on the same day with the Revised Statutes, section 5595 of which declares that the Revised Statutes embrace the general and permanent statutes of the United States which were in force on the first day of December, 1873. Section 5601 declares that the enactment of the Revision is not to affect or repeal any act of congress passed since the first day of December, 1873; that all acts passed since that date are to have full effect as if passed after the enactment of the Revision; and that, so far as such acts vary from or conflict with any provision contained in the Revision, they are to have effect as subsequent statutes, and as repealing any portion of the Revision inconsistent therewith. The act of June 22, 1874, is therefore a subsequent statute to the Revised Statutes, and repeals any portion thereof which is inconsistent with such subsequent statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a full review of the above-recited provisions of the act of June 22, 1874, and of its other provisions, it is apparent that, so far, at least, as the act subject to the penalties denounced in section 2864 are concerned, they are entirely covered by the provisions of section 12 of the act of June 22, 1874. There is no act denounced by section 2864 that is not embraced, both as to person and character of act, by the provisions of section 12. The latter section adds, as a punishment for the offense, fine or imprisonment, or both, and a forfeiture of the merchandise, in addition to the fine. It leaves out a forfeiture of the value of the merchandise, and forfeiture of such value is inconsistent with the terms of section 12, and is therefore repealed by it. The absolute forfeiture of the merchandise provided for by section 12 is inconsistent, also, with the alternative forfeiture of the merchandise or its value, provided for by section 2864. The provisions of the two statutes cannot stand together. <i>Norris</i> v. <i>Crocker</i>, 13 How. 429, 438; <i>U.

By the act of February 18, 1875, <i>c.</i> 80, (18 St. 319,) entitled 'An act to correct errors and to supply omissions in the Revised Statutes of the United States,' and which act states 'that, for the purpose of correcting errors and supplying omissions in the act entitled 'An act to revise and consolidate the statutes of the United States in force on the first day of December, Anno Domini one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three,' so as to make the same truly express such laws, the following amendments are hereby made therein,' it is provided as follows: 'Section two thousand eight hundred and sixty-four is amended by inserting in the last line, after the word 'merchandise,' the words 'or the value thereof.\" Section 2 of the act directs the secretary of state, 'if practicable, to cause this act to be printed and bound in the volume of the Revised Statutes of the United States.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is contended for the United States that this amendment to section 2864, made by the act of February 18, 1875, can be reasonably accounted for only upon the theory that, at the date it was made, which was after the passage of the act of June 22, 1874, <i>c.</i> 391, congress regarded section 2864, as thus amended, as a valid existing law, particularly in respect to the amendment, and intended to declare that the value of the merchandise should be forfeited under section 2864, notwithstanding the passage of the act of June 22, 1874  <i>c.</i> 391. But we are of opinion that the amendment made by the act of February 18, 1875, did not have the effect contended for. Its sole object was to correct errors and supply omissions in the text of the Revised Statutes, as its title indicates, so as to make the same truly express the statutes in force on the first of December, 1873, and it made special reference to the printed volume of the Revised Statutes. It was in no respect new legislation, nor a new law enacted to take effect from the date of its passage, in such wise as to alter any enactment made since the passage of the Revised Statutes. The intention was to make section 2864 read as it ought to have read in the printed volume, in the shape in which it was in force on the first of December, 1873, as a part of section 1 of the act of March 3, 1863, <i>c.</i> 76, (12 St. 738.) It left the act of June 22, 1874, <i>c.</i> 391, to have its full effect in respect to section 2864, in like manner as if the words 'or the value thereof' had been contained in that section in the printed volume of the Revised Statutes. There was a law in force on December 1, 1873, and subsequently thereto, down to June 22, 1874, authorizing a forfeiture of the value of merchandise for the causes stated in section 2864, and the fact that forfeitures of such value might have been incurred during the intervening period between December 1, 1873, and June 22, 1874, was a sufficient reason for the correction made in section 2864.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Affirming 19 Fed.
