CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>This was a suit in equity begun by Richard E. Whitsitt, then in life, and James Meskew, to quiet their possession of certain lots in Denver, Colorado. A decree was entered October 6, 1880, dismissing the bill. From that decree the complainants took an appeal to this court, which was dismissed at October Term, 1880, because it did not appear that the value of the matter in dispute exceeded $5000. <i>Whitsitt</i> v. <i>Railroad Company,</i> 103 U.S. 770. On the 20th of July, 1881, Emma C. Whitsitt appeared in the Circuit Court, and, suggesting the death of Richard E. Whitsitt, asked to be made a party to the suit in his stead, as sole heir and devisee. An order to this effect was made, and she, on the 30th of August, 1881, filed in the Circuit Court an affidavit showing that the value of the matter in dispute did exceed $5000. On the same day, she took another appeal, which was docketed in this court September 24, 1881, and dismissed, under Rule 16, April 5, 1884, for want of prosecution. The mandate from this court under this appeal was filed in the Circuit Court September 9, 1884, and the next day, September 10, Mrs. Whitsitt presented to the district judge for the District of Colorado another appeal bond in the suit, which he accepted, and he also signed a citation that was duly served on the same day. This last appeal was docketed in this court September 22, 1884.
