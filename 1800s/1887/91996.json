Because of the payment of the $900 to his wife, shortly before the assignment, for a debt which he claims to have owed to her; 3. Because he permitted her to take money from the cash drawer; and 4. Because more supplies than usual were taken from the store to his house shortly before the assignment.</p>\n<p>The answer to these objections is readily given, and it appears to us conclusive.

The law has not said he shall divide his estate ratably among his creditors.

The deed was in fact a mortgage of the property to secure against a prospective liability, and in such cases it is usual for the grantor or mortgagor to remain in possession of the property until the maturity of the obligation and a sale of the premises. Standing by itself, the deed was not open to any serious objection. And even that reservation was defeated by the assignment, which included the property in question with other property of the assignor, and provided that the assignee should take possession of the same and sell and dispose of it with all convenient diligence. The assignment was subsequent to the deed and carried all that could in any way be considered as a benefit secured by the deed to the assignor. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*456</span> The creditors were not, therefore, in any way hindered or defrauded by the alleged reservation.</p>\n<p>There is nothing in Gunter's payment to his wife of the $900 which can affect the validity of the assignment.

His statement is not contradicted. Under these circumstances he was not blameworthy in paying to his wife the amount he had used belonging to her. But, as counsel well observes, if that payment were fraudulent, it would not vitiate a subsequent assignment.

H. Gunter, a merchant who had been for many years engaged in business at Sardis, in Mississippi, was largely indebted to the complainants and others; and, being unable to pay them in full, made a general assignment of his property of every description, except such as was exempt from execution, to one S. G. Spain, as trustee, for their benefit, which was recorded the same day. The assignment preferred certain of the creditors, who are named in a schedule annexed. Among them were the complainants, Estes, Doan &amp; Co., merchants at Memphis, in Tennessee. The sum due them was $13,587.68, but they were prf erred only to the amount of $10,000. Their claim grew out of advances of cash and supplies furnished to Gunter. There is no question as to its amount or justice. On the same day, and immediately preceding the execution of the assignment, Gunter executed a deed of a house and lot in Sardis to one J. G. Hall, as trustee, to secure the firm of Boothe, rice &amp; Carleton, who were sureties upon his note, held by the Bank of Sardis, for $1,000, due on the first of December, 1882. This deed was to be void if the note was paid at maturity; otherwise the trustee was, on the written request of the sureties, to take possession of and sell the property at public auction, after due notice, and apply the proceeds to its payment. Any surplus was to be returned to the grantor. It the property should at any time 'become endangered' as a security, the trustee was at liberty to take possession of and hold it until the debt was discharged by payment or by sale of the property, but until demanded by the trustee the grantor was to hold the same subject to the deed of trust. This deed was also recorded on the same day, and a few minutes before the assignment. At the same time Gunter transferred and delivered to several of his clerks and employes certain notes and accounts in payment of his indebtedness to them. It was also in proof that Gunter was hopelessly insolvent; that for 12 days before he made the assignment he knew of his condition, and contemplated making the assignment; that during this time he gave to his wife the sum of $900 in payment of an alleged indebtedness to her, and she was permitted to take money from the drawer of the store; and that more goods than usual were carried from the store to his house.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after the assignment and deed of trust were recorded the defendants Bickham &amp; Moore, who were also creditors of Gunter, sued out an attachment against him in the circuit court of United States for the Northern district of Mississippi, which was levied on the property assigned by Gunter to Spain, as trustee. followed by attachments of other creditors, and the property was seized by the marshal. Spain, the assignee, thereupon renounced his trust and refused further to act. Thereupon the complainants, Estes &amp; Doan, who were much the largest creditors of Gunter, filed their bill against Bickham &amp; Moore and other attaching creditors, setting forth the assignment of Gunter to Spain, his debt to them, the several attachments levied, and the refusal of Spain, the assignee, to act; and praying the court to appoint a trustee in his place, to direct the enforcement of the trust, and to enjoin the attaching creditors from further proceeding with their suits. Bickham &amp; Moore and other defendants answered, charging that the assignment was fraudulent and void, but admitting that Spain refused to act as trustee or assignee. Proofs were taken, and upon the hearing the court held that the assignment was fraudulent and void, and accordingly entered a decree dismissing the bill with costs. From this decree the complainants have appealed to this court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Luke E. Wright</i>, for appellants.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>H. M. Sullivan, W. V.
