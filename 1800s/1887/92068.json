The judgment was not only against Plumb personally, but it was made a special lien on the lands, which were the subject of taxation, because he was the actual owner at the time of the levy.

The record in this case shows that the lands were conveyed by the Navigation and Railroad Company to Plumb in 1859, and he, in 1861, conveyed them to Wade in trust as security for a debt he owed a bank. This deed was duly recorded in the proper recording office. In 1865 the lands were sold by Wade under his trust and conveyed to Edward Wesley, for the sole use and benefit of Plumb. This deed was not put on record before the suit of the Homestead Company was begun. As soon as Plumb heard of the suit he employed counsel, and had an answer filed in the name of Wade, setting up a defence to the claim of the company, and asserting that the superior title was in those who held under the river grant. He paid his proportion of the expenses of the litigation, and controlled the defence, so far as Wade was concerned. His interests in the suit were properly represented by Wade, whom he allowed to appear on the records of the county as the real owner of the lands. If there had been a decree against Wade for the taxes, and a lien therefor established on the lands, he would have been bound, and could not have resisted the enforcement of the lien. So, too, if a personal decree had been rendered against Wade for the money, it would have been conclusive in an action by Wade to recover from him money paid for his use in satisfaction of the decree. He was bound, because he was represented in the suit by Wade, under whom he claimed. This case is the converse of that of <i>Litchfield</i> v. <i>Goodnow, ante,</i> 549.
