Upon the issue thus presented testimony was taken by both parties; that for Dumbleton tending to prove that the value was $7,000, and that for Talkington that it was less than $4,000. A decree was entered November 8, 1886, finding that the value of the land 'was and still is $5,000, and no more,' and directing Talkington to reconvey on the payment to him of the sum of $812. From that decree Talkington, and his co-defendants, who claim under him, took this appeal, which Dumbleton moves to dismiss because the value of the matter in dispute does not exceed $5,000; that being the amount now required for our jurisdiction on appeals and writs of error from the supreme courts of the territories in cases like this. 23 St. 443,(Act March 3, 1885,<i>c.</i> 355).
