The end caps B B' are united to the body C, without flanges or projections, by tin joints, as at <i>f f,</i> made by soldering with pure tin, which, being a ringing metal, unites closely with the steel exterior to make a firm and durable joint, as other solders having lead in them will not do.

The opinion delivered by the circuit court in dismissing the bill is reported, and drawings of the fountain of each party given, in 22 Blatchf. 427, 21 Fed. Rep. 641. The only claim relied on at the argument of this appeal was the second claim of the reissue; being the one most like the single claim of the original patent. The specifications, the drawings therein referred to, and the claims in question were alike in the two patents; differing only, as shown below, by omitting in the reissue the words of the original patent which are printed in brackets, and by inserting the words printed in italics, and three additional claims immaterial to the present inquiry. After a general reference to the drawings, the specification proceeds as follows: 'My invention consists in a novel construction of a tin-lined steel fountain for soda-water, and other aerated or gaseous liquids; such fountain combining lightness with strength, and being of cylindrical form and uniform dimensions, or thereabout, throughout its length, thereby adding to the convenience of packing and handling; also being exempt from expansion or permanent lateral distension by the interior pressure to which it is subjected, thus preserving its form, and contributing to its durability.

C is the exterior shell or body proper, made of galvanized sheet-steel, as may also be the end-caps, B, B', which are soldered to or over the extremities of the same, and constitute, as it were, parts of said body, C, that [closely] surrounds or fits over the tin lining A. The end-caps, B, B', are united to the body, C, without flanges or projections, by tin joints, as at <i>f, f</i>, made by soldering with pure tin, which, being a ringing metal, unites closely with the steel exterior to make a firm and durable joint, as other solders having lead in them will not do.

But the only claim of the original patent is for 'the tin vessel, incased by a steel cylinder, and ends soldered to the latter, in the manner substantially as described;' and the manner described in the specification of fastening the end-caps to the body of the outer shell is, 'without flanges or projections, by tin joints, made by soldering with pure tin, which, being a ringing metal, unites closely with the steel exterior to make a firm and durable joint, as other solders having lead in them will not do.' The patentee himself testified that when he made his invention he knew of others having used iron fountains lined with sheet block tin; that the first fountains he made were soldered with tin and lead solder, usually known as soft solder, and he found that would not do, and therefore adopted a solder of pure tin; and that he dispensed with rivets, because they prevented the fountain being repaired without tearing the shell in taking out the rivets. In short, by the terms of the specification and claim, in the then existing state of the art, and according to the intention of the patentee, his patent was limited to a fountain in which the caps were connected with the outer cylinder by pure tin solder, without rivets or flanges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fountain made by the defendant, on the other hand, the caps are fastened to the body at both ends by a solder of half tin and half lead, as well as by rivets, and there are vertical flanges at one end, through which the rivets pass. It is quite clear, therefore, that, if the original patent had remained unaltered, there would have been no infringement. The reissue was taken out seven years after the original patent, and a year or two after the patentee knew that the defendant was making such a fountain as is now alleged to be an infringement. The repetition of the original specification in the reissue, word for word, (except only in the unimportant variation of omitting the word 'closely,' in speaking of the fitting of the shell to the lining,) as well as the testimony of the patentee, proves that there was no defect or insufficiency in the original specification, and no error, inadvertence, or mistake in framing it. If the omission in the claim of the reissue, after the mention of the outer cylinder and the ends, of the words 'soldered to the latter,' before the words 'in the manner substantially as described,' still leaves the claim to be construed and limited by the previous description in the specification, the patentee is no better off than if he had not taken out a reissue. But if the effect of omitting the words in question is to extend the claim to a fountain the outer cylinder and ends of which are fastened together in any other manner than by a solder of pure tin, the claim is enlarged by omitting an essential element of the patentee's invention, and the reissue is invalid, by the settled law of this court. <i>Miller</i> v. <i>Brass Co.</i>,  04 U.
