The defendant, in its answer, admitted the agreement sued on, but denied any breach; denied that the plaintiff was the original and first inventor of any improvement in plows, and averred that his alleged improvement had been described in six earlier patents specified: admitted that the defendant had made and sold plows according to the method described in letters patent granted March 9, 1880, to one Berthiaume, and averred that those plows were constructed upon an entirely different principle from the plaintiff's. The plaintiff filed a general replication, denying the allegations of the answer. A jury trial having been duly waived in writing, the case was tried by the court, which, upon facts set forth in detail, found that the defendant had made 960 plows under the Berthianume patent, and 350 other plows; that all those plows infringed the plaintiff's patent, and that the plaintiff's invention was not anticipated by either of the six other patent set up in the answer; and concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to a royalty of $2.50 on each plow sold by the defendant, amounting to $3,275; overruled a motion for a new trial; and gave judgment for the plaintiff accordingly. 29 Fed.

Rep. 290.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant sued out this writ of error, which the original plaintiff now moves to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, because the judgment below was for less than $5,000. The decision of this motion depends upon section 699 of the Revised Statutes, by which a writ of error or appeal may be allowed from any final judgment or decree of the circuit court, without regard to the sum or value in dispute, 'in any case touching patent-rights.' This section substantially re-enacts the corresponding provision of the patent act of 1870, in which the words were 'in any action, suit, controversy, or case, at law or in equity, touching patent-rights.' Act of July 8, 1870, c. 230, &#167; 56, (16 St. 207.) The language applied to this subject in the patent act of 1836, under which the cases of <i>Wilson</i> v. <i>Sandford</i>, 10 How. 99, and <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Shannon</i>, 20 How. 55, were decided, was that used in that act in defining the jurisdiction of the circuit in patent cases, namely, 'actions, suits, controversies and cases, arising under any law of the United States, granting or confirming to inventos  the exclusive rights to their inventions or discoveries.' Act of July 4, 1836, c. 357, &#167; 17, (5 St. 124.) Similar words were used in the patent act of 1861 in defining the jurisdiction of this court. Act of February 18, 1861, c. 37, (12 St. 130.) But in the act of 1870, as in the Revised Statutes, congress, while using similar language in defining the jurisdiction of the circuit court, substituted (it must be supposed purposely) the new phrase 'touching patent-rights,' in defining the jurisdiction of this court. The present case was an action upon a contract by which the plaintiff licensed the defendant to make and sell a patented article, and not a suit for infringing the plaintiff's patent. But the questions whether that patent was valid, and whether it had been infringed, were put in issue by the pleadings, and decided by the circuit court. Whether, within the meaning of other statutes, and in the light of previous decisions, this case should be considered as 'arising under' the patent laws of the United States, is a question not before us. See <i>Manufacturing Co.</i> v. <i>Hyatt</i>, 125 U. S. 46, <i>ante</i>, 756, and cases there cited. It is sufficient for the decision of this motion that we have no doubt that a case in which the validity and the infringement of a patent are controverted is a 'case touching patent-rights,' and therefore within the appellate jurisdiction of this court, under section 699 of the Revised Statutes, without regard to the sum or value in dispute.
