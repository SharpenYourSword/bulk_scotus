From this judgment Chappell prosecuted an appeal to the court of appeals of Maryland, by which tribunal the judgment was affirmed on the 14th day of March, 1888. On the 27th of March Chappell moved for a rehearing, upon the ground, which had not been up to that time presented in any form, that the circuit court for Howard county should have limited the measure of damages to the value of the scow which occasioned the injury complained of, under the provisions of section 18, c. 121, act Cong. June 26, 1884, (23 St. at Large, 57.) The court of appeals overruled the motion, because, as the court states, 'this act of congress was not before the circuit court when the case was tried, nor before this court on appeal, and that no reference to it or construction of it was made in either court.' After an unsuccessful application therefor to the chief judge of the court of appeals, a writ of error was finally allowed by one of the justices of this court, and now comes before us upon a motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To give this court jurisdiction to review the judgment of a state court under section 709 of the Revised Statutes, because of the denial by a state court of any title, right, privilege, or immunity claimed under the constitution or any treaty or statute of the United States, it must appear on the record that such title, right, privilege, or immunity was 'specially set up or claimed,' at the proper time, in the proper way. 'To be reviewable here,' says WAITE, C. J., in Spies v. Illinois, 123 U. S. 181, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 21, 22, 'the decision must be against the right so set up or claimed.
