The claim is made under the provisions of the act of June 2, 1858, entitled 'An act to provide for the location of certain confirmed private land claims of the state of Missouri, and for other purposes,' (11 St. 294;) the claim in question having been confirmed by act of congress passed February 28, 1823, (3 St. 727.) The suit is subject to the same objections which exist in relation to the suits of Carrie Jones and others, ante, 669, (just disposed of,) and the same decree must be made as in thos  cases. The decree of the circuit court is reversed, and the cause remanded, with instructions to dismiss the original petition or bill.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>131 U.S. 21 (1889)</b></center>\n<center><h1>UNITED STATES<br>\nv.<br>\nDREW.</h1></center>\n<center>No. 1061.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Argued January 28, 29, 1889.</center>\n<center>Decided May 13, 1889.</center>\nERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA.\n<p><i>Mr. Solicitor General</i> for plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p><i>Mr. James L.
