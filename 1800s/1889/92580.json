This explicit finding cannot be controlled by statements of fact in those parts of the answer which set up as independent defences matters in avoidance, or in a bill of exceptions relating to one of those defences only. Such statements, made for the purpose of presenting the issue to which they relate, are not evidence upon any other issue in the same record.
