These exceptions, however, cannot avail the plaintiff in error, because the substance of the instructions refused was contained in the charge subsequently given by the court.

The whole charge must be substantially wrong before such a general exception will avail for any purpose. This is the settled law established by numerous decisions of this court. <i>Lincoln</i> v. <i>Claflin,</i> 7 Wall. 132, 139; <i>Cooper</i> v. <i>Schlesinger,</i> 111 U.S. 148, 151; <i>Mobile &amp; Montgomery Railway Co.</i> v. <i>Jurey,</i> 111 U.S. 584, 596; <i>Burton</i> v. <i>West Jersey Ferry Co.,</i> 114 U.S. 474, 476.
