CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>In December, 1865, Milton Parker filed his bill in the Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia, against John N. Clarkson and some seventy other defendants, seeking the marshalling of assets and the subjection of Clarkson's property <span class=\"star-pagination\">*268</span> to the satisfaction of certain judgments held by the complainant against him, which appears to have been treated, and may be considered, as having been intended to bring all Clarkson's creditors into concourse, and after the adjustment of the liens of those having security, to devote any remaining property, or any surplus arising upon the securities, to the discharge of his liabilities. The cause was referred to a commissioner to take, state and report an account of the property owned by Clarkson and the liens thereon and their priorities, and various reports were made in the premises.</p>\n<p>On the 8th day of July, 1871, C.G. Hussey &amp; Company and John Johns, assignee of John N. Clarkson in bankruptcy, described in an order of the Circuit Court of that date as defendants, filed their petition and affidavit, sworn to by \"J.N.
