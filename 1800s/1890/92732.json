To raise revenue to meet its expenses, which included that liability, the county was authorized to levy a tax of 50 cents on every $100 of valuation of taxable property in the county. U. S. v. County of Clark, 96 U. S. 211; County Court v. U. S., 109 U. S. 229, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 131. In this case it appears that for the year 1885 the county had levied only 30 cents on every $100 of property; but it set up in its answer that t  had levied 50 cents, treating the 20 cents which had been levied by the boards of townships for township and bridge purposes as part of the 50 cents. The township is a separate organization from that of the county, with authority to purchase and hold real estate and make contracts and control its corporate property, and its taxes levied for those purposes over which it has control can in no just sense be termed taxes for county purposes. There can be therefore no valid objection to the county's levy of an additional 20 cents on the $100 to make up the 50 cents which it is authorized to levy to meet its expenses and liabilites. The apportioning of the funds collected to distinct and separate purposes does not affect the question presented.
