Cochran</i> for the Berkshire National Bank and Hall's executors.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BLATCHFORD delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>This is a suit in equity, brought January 29, 1879, in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Massachusetts, by the Yale Lock Manufacturing Company, a Connecticut corporation, and James Sargent and Halbert S. Greenleaf, composing the firm of Sargent &amp; Greenleaf, against the Berkshire National Bank, a national banking corporation doing business at North Adams, in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>The suit was brought for the infringement of two reissued letters patent. One of them is reissue No. 7947, granted November 13, 1877, to James Sargent, as inventor, for an \"improvement in combined time-lock, combination lock, and bolt-work for safes,\" on an application filed October 3, 1877, the original patent, No. 195,539, having been granted to Sargent, September 25, 1877. Only claim 3 of reissue No. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*344</span> 7947 is alleged to have been infringed. The other reissue is No. 8550, granted to the Yale Lock Manufacturing Company, January 21, 1879, on an application filed October 14, 1878, for an \"improvement in time-locks,\" the original patent, No. 146,832, having been granted to Samuel A. Little, as inventor, January 27, 1874, and having been reissued as No. 7104, to the Yale Lock Manufacturing Company, May 9, 1876, and again reissued to that company, as No. 8035, January 8, 1878. Only claims 1 and 7 of reissue No. 8550 are alleged to have been infringed.</p>\n<p>After the filing of the bill, and by agreement of the parties, Joseph L. Hall, of Cincinnati, Ohio, was admitted as a defendant. An amended bill was filed, and the bank and Hall answered it. As to both reissues, the answer denied that, before they were granted, the patents were inoperative by reason of a defective or insufficient specification; that any errors arose by inadvertency, accident and mistake; that any reissues were necessary or are valid; and that the reissues were for the same inventions as were shown and described in the original patents. It also set up want of novelty and non-infringement.</p>\n<p>After replication, proofs were taken on both sides, and the case was heard in the Circuit Court by Judge Lowell. His opinion is reported in 17 Fed. Rep. 531. He held that claim 3 of the Sargent reissue, No. 7947, was invalid, and ordered a decree for the plaintiffs as to claims 1 and 7 of the Little reissue, No. 8550. On the 14th of August, 1883, an interlocutory decree was entered, adjudging reissue No. 8550 to be valid, as to claims 1 and 7; that the defendants had infringed those claims; and ordering a reference to a master to take an account of profits and to report damages.</p>\n<p>In July, 1884, the defendants were allowed to amend their answer by setting up an additional anticipation of the Little patent, proofs were taken thereon, and the case was reheard, before Judge Colt, on the new evidence. He affirmed the former decree, in an opinion reported in 26 Fed. Rep. 104.</p>\n<p>The master reported $60 damages in favor of the plaintiffs, and both parties excepted to the report. A final decree was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*345</span> entered on the 12th of February, 1886, confirming the report, overruling the exceptions of both parties and adjudging a recovery in favor of the plaintiffs for $60 damages and certain costs, dismissing the bill as to the Sargent reissue, No. 7947, and awarding a perpetual injunction as to claims 1 and 7 of the Little reissue, No. 8550. From this decree both parties have appealed. Joseph L. Hall having died, his executors and trustees have been made parties in his place.</p>\n<p>The respective specifications and claims of the original Sargent patent, No. 195,539, and of its reissue, No. 7947, are set forth below in parallel columns, the parts in each which are not found in the other being in italic. The drawings are the same in both.</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n<i>Original patent,</i> N<i>o.</i> 195,539.                   <i>Reissue No.</i> 7947.\n\"Be it known that I, James                            \"Be it known that I, James\nSargent, of the city of Rochester,                    Sargent, of the city of Rochester,\nin the county of Monroe                               in the county of Monroe\nand State of New York, have                           and State of New York, have\ninvented a certain new and                            invented a certain new and\nuseful improvement in locks;                          useful improvement in <i>combined</i>\nand I do hereby declare that                          <i>time</i>-locks, <i>combination-locks,</i>\nthe following is a full, clear,                       <i>and bolt-work for safe and</i>\nand exact description of the                          <i>vault doors;</i> and I do hereby\nconstruction and operation of                         declare that the following is a\nthe same, reference being had                         full, clear, and exact description\nto the accompanying drawings,                         of the construction and\nin which figure 1 <i>is an</i>                      operation of the same, reference\n<i>elevation of my improvement</i>                  being had to the accompanying\n<i>applied to</i> a safe-door.

Rep. 377. He held that claim 3 covered a new and patentable invention and was valid. On the question of the validity of the reissue as to claim 3, he said: \"It is next urged that the third claim of the reissue is void, because it was abandoned by the patentee upon the objection of the Patent Office, when the original application was pending. In Sargent's original application he made one broad claim. The application was rejected by the examiner, whose decision was reversed by the board of examiners. The examiner then requested that a new application be made, upon the ground that the case presented to the board was not the same case which had been presented to him. A new application was made, containing only the first two claims of the reissue. Then followed a long and earnestly contested litigation in the Patent Office between various interfering applicants, in which, apparently, both patentability and priority were discussed. The Little application contained the broad claim, and the board of examiners said, at one stage of the litigation, whether this question was properly before them or not, that this claim was patentable; so that, when the question came before them upon appeal from the decision of the examiner against the Sargent reissue, the board say: `The claim in controversy is the same, in substance, as the first claim of Little, whose application was once in interference with Sargent, and which was admitted to be patentable by the Office at the time of the declaration of the interference. The patentability of Little's claim has once been before us in the aforesaid interference, and, after full argument, we concluded that his claim was tenable, and held that some one who was first to combine with the bolt-work on a vault or safe-door, a key-lock and time-lock acting independently of each other, but jointly upon the bolt-work, might have a valid patent therefor.' These facts exclude the third claim from the decision, or the <i>dicta,</i> in the case of <i>Leggett</i> v. <i>Avery,</i> 101 U.S. 256. I do not understand that the objection that the reissue is for a different invention from the original was pressed by either of the counsel for the defendant. It is sufficient to say, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*372</span> that the claims of the original were for the combination of the third claim, provided with a device whereby the bolt-work may be retained in the unlocked position, for shutting the door, and be automatically locked by the time-lock and mechanically by the key-lock when the bolt-work is cast. The patentee had shown `means whereby' but, if I have been correct thus far, the gist of his invention consisted, not in that device, but in the triple combination. Other different `devices whereby,' could be introduced by other inventors, which would destroy the value of his patent, if it was unduly limited. As said by the board of examiners, `means whereby,' while being essential to the convenient use of this combination, is merely incidental to the main idea, and may be varied indefinitely without departing from the spirit and scope of the applicant's invention.\"</p>\n<p>The only remark made by Judge Lowell, in his opinion in the present case, as to the validity of reissue No. 7947, as respects claim 3, is, that the patent \"was reissued so soon after its granting that it is not obnoxious to the objection of undue delay.\" The application for the reissue was filed 13 days after the original patent was issued, and the reissue was granted 36 days after the application for it was filed. Judge Lowell held claim 3 to be invalid on the ground that, if it was a claim irrespective of any particular means for carrying it out it was void as a patent for a principle, independently of the state of the art; and that, in view of the state of the art, it was void. He was of opinion, that there was no patentable novelty in putting a time-lock, which was old, in place of one of two combination locks, where two combination locks had been before used to dog one combined bolt-work; that it was not patentable to substitute a well-known multiple bolt-work for two such bolt-works, where a time-lock and a combination lock had been before combined in the use of two multiple bolt-works; and that there was no patentable novelty in combining two locks with a single door.</p>\n<p>A history of the proceedings in the Patent Office in regard to patent No. 195,539 and reissue No. 7947, shows that claim 3 of that reissue must be held to be invalid.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*373</span> On the 9th of May, 1874, Sargent filed an application for a patent which claimed broadly the combination of a time-lock, an ordinary lock and a safe-bolt connected with both of them. The claim he made was as follows: \"What I claim is the combination, with a clock or time-movement lock and an ordinary lock, attached independently to a safe or vault-door, of a safe-bolt constructed so as to rest against or connect with both of said locks, substantially as described, whereby the safe-bolt cannot be withdrawn till both locks have been unlocked.\"</p>\n<p>In the specification he then filed he said: \"This improvement belongs to that class in which two locks are applied upon a safe or vault-door for the purpose of preventing the withdrawal of the safe-bolt till both locks have been unlocked... . I employ one ordinary combination or key-lock and one time-movement or clock-lock, attached independently to the door, and employ in combination therewith a safe-bolt that bears against or connects with both of said locks in such a manner that though the ordinary lock may be picked or opened, yet the clock-lock cannot be reached, and the safe-bolt therefore cannot be released till the clock has performed its office and unlocked its lock at the predetermined hour... . But it is by no means essential to this invention that the circular form of lock-bolt should be used, as the ordinary style of sliding-bolt, or other forms of shifting bearings, could be employed, if desired... . Clock-locks have before been used both separately and in connection with combination locks. Where used alone they are insecure, for the reason that burglars, ascertaining the hour upon which the lock is set, may, by confining or disabling the officers of the bank having control of the same, open the safe when the hour arrives. In my improvement such result cannot occur, because the combination lock still locks the safe. Where clock-locks have been combined with ordinary locks heretofore, so far as I am aware, the said locks have been connected by a lever or other connection, so that their actions are dependent on each other. In such case, if the combination or key-lock is injured by a lock-pick, by violence or otherwise, the clock-lock is liable to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*374</span> injury also. By making these independent, as described, I avoid these difficulties.\"</p>\n<p>This application was rejected by the examiner, but, on appeal, his decision was overruled by the examiners-in-chief, February 17, 1875. The examiner then ascertained that the case had been argued before the examiners-in-chief on an invention which had not been before the examiner, and that another model was used before the examiners-in-chief in place of the one properly in the case. The new feature of invention was a device by which the time-lock could be properly set and the door then be closed; but that device, which made the invention an operative one, was not shown in the drawing, the specification or the model, which had been before the examiner. In a communication made to Sargent by the examiner at the time, February 20, 1875, he said: \"As far as the Office knows by the record of the case, this new invention may not have been contemporaneous with the first one. The examiner would suggest that a new case be at once filed embodying this invention, which makes the devices operative, and against the patentability of which no question will be raised. The claim, however, must be not broadly for A combined with C, which is not conceded to be entirely inoperative, but A and B combined either with C or some mechanical equivalent thereof, which alone makes A and B operative.\" He also said: \"It is suggested to applicant that he file a new case introducing the new combining device which allows the door to be shut after the time-lock is set, and thus takes it out from the new reference cited, and the examiner will, in all proper ways, hasten the case forward upon a legitimate claim for A and B with suitable combining device to allow the door to be closed after the time-lock is set, inasmuch as no obstacle exists, as the examiner is at present advised.\"</p>\n<p>In accordance with this suggestion, Sargent, on the 10th of March, 1875, filed a new application, which resulted in the granting of patent No. 195,539. The specification of this application said: \"In locking the safe or vault-door, some device is necessary to allow the door-bolt to remain back in the unlocked position until the door is closed, without interfering <span class=\"star-pagination\">*375</span> with the clock-lock. [A variety of devices may be employed for this purpose.]\" This clause in brackets was afterwards erased.</p>\n<p>The specification of this application also said: \"In Fig. 1 is shown another device for the same purpose, situated outside the lock, which is the subject matter of another application. It consists of a socket or bearing, <i>h,</i> attached to the tie-piece, E, of the door-bolt, and sliding on an independent stud, <i>a',</i> resting against the lock-bolt. A spring locking-pin, <i>i,</i> is used to connect the parts, when the door-bolt is thrown forward to connect with the jamb. In this case, the lock-bolt, D, may be made solid, and may be either of the turning or sliding kind. [Other devices might be used to allow the door to shut. I do not wish to confine myself to any particular form of the device.]\" The sentences in brackets were afterwards erased.</p>\n<p>Sargent thus limited himself to combinations wherein one or the other of the peculiar devices invented by him should be an essential element, which is further evidenced by the fact that, in claim 1, as accepted by him, the combination of the clock-lock and combination lock, as applied to the door-bolt, was to be provided with a device whereby the door-bolt might be retained in the unlocked position for shutting the door; and in claim 2, the same combination was to be provided with a lock-bolt having an opening or an offset which was automatically brought in and out of coincidence with the tongue of the door-bolt, whereby the latter might be retained in the unlocked position for shutting the door.</p>\n<p>On the 16th of March, 1875, the examiner rejected claim 1, saying that it was to be found substantially in the patent granted to Cornell, August 10, 1858, for \"safe bolt-work,\" and referring also to three prior patents for time-locks, and adding, that \"merely to substitute either one of the above time-locks for one of the locks shown in Cornell's patent, is not regarded as a patentable difference.\" To this Sargent's attorney replied, on the 17th of March, 1875: \"The combination is such as to require something else to be done other than to simply substitute for one of the key-locks shown in Cornell's patent one of the time-locks cited by the examiner\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*376</span> This referred to the devices invented by Sargent, by which his combination was made operative.</p>\n<p>On the 19th of March, 1875, Sargent's attorney struck out the parts in brackets, before quoted, and also struck out claim 1 and substituted as claim 1 what is claim 2 in the original patent as granted. On March 20, 1875, the attorney reinstated claim 1, and added as claim 2 what is claim 2 in the original patent.</p>\n<p>On the 22d of March, 1875, the examiner rejected both of the claims, on the references before made, and referred also to the English patent to W. Rutherford, of April 14, 1831. He added, that \"a rotating lock-bolt having an opening or an offset is not new,\" and referred especially to two prior patents, and said: \"The second claim may possibly be allowed if amended by inserting the words `constructed in two parts and' after `lock-bolt.'\"</p>\n<p>An appeal was taken from this decision, and on the 27th of March, 1875, the board of examiners-in-chief reversed the decision of the examiner, doing so on the ground that the combination embracing Sargent's peculiar devices for retaining the door-bolt in an unlocked position, for shutting the door, were new and patentable. Before Sargent's patent could issue, he was put into interference with Stockwell, Burge and Little, and also with Pillard and Lillie. It is evident, from decisions made by the examiner of interferences, and by the Commissioner of Patents, in questions arising in some of these interferences, that Sargent was regarded as making no claim to a broad combination between the bolt-work of a door, and a time-lock, and an independent non-time-lock, which is the subject matter of claim 3 of reissue No. 7947.</p>\n<p>The examiner, the examiners-in-chief and the Commissioner of Patents decided priority of invention in favor of Sargent, as to the combination, by Sargent, of the bolt-work, with a time-lock, and a non-time-lock, and his device for retaining the door-bolt in its retracted position, for shutting the door without interfering with the lock mechanism. The patent No. 195,539 was then issued, on September 25, 1877, with the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*377</span> two claims before set forth, limited by the proceedings which so took place in the Patent Office.</p>\n<p>The lock of the defendants did not infringe either of the two claims of the original patent, for it did not contain what is called in claim 1 \"a device whereby the door-bolt may be retained in the unlocked position for shutting the door,\" after the time-lock is set; nor did it contain what is called in claim 2 \"a lock-bolt having an opening or an offset which is automatically brought in and out of coincidence with the tongue of the door-bolt.\" This is apparent from the fact that it is not contended that the defendants' lock infringes either claim 1 or claim 2 of reissue No. 7947, which two claims are substantially identical with claims 1 and 2 of the original patent.</p>\n<p>On the 8th of October, 1877, Sargent filed an application for a reissue of patent No. 195,539. He inserted in his specification what is claim 3 of the reissue as granted. That claim is as broad as the claim made in his application of May 9, 1874, which, as before shown, he abandoned. The examiner rejected this claim twice, and after the second rejection, and on the 26th of October, 1877, Sargent appealed to the examiners-in-chief. In the statement of appeal his attorney said: \"All time-locks used with bolt-work must have some mechanical arrangement to enable the bolt-work to be retracted for closing the door. Such is present in many old patents, and has never been claimed by my client; but what is claimed by him is for the union of such an old, well-known time-lock with a combination lock and bolt-work all arranged on the same door.\" This shows the breadth of the claim, as compared with claims 1 and 2 of the original patent.</p>\n<p>The examiner, in his answer to the reasons of appeal, said: \"Leaving out the descriptive and recitative parts of the claim as well as all superfluous and misleading matter, we have as the claim, the following elements and arrangements, viz.: A combination or key-lock, and a time-lock, combined with the bolt-work of a safe-door, both used independently and resting against or connecting with the bolt-work. The only elements are the two locks and the bolt-work, no other element being hinted at even, and the arrangement of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*378</span> said elements is, that the locks rest against or connect with bolt-work and are used independently of each other. To recite, in the claim, that the `key-lock is controllable from the outside' and the `time-lock upon the inside only' is entirely unnecessary, for all key or combination locks of safes are controlled only from the outside, and all time-locks, as a matter of course, upon the inside, are automatically unlocked. It is a well-settled principle that a mere explanation of parts or recital of functions neither adds to nor takes away from a claim. All the matter which recites that the door cannot be opened until the lock allows it is a mere superfluity. If, in an ordinary lock patent, we were to add to the claim `the arrangement being such that the door cannot be opened until it is unlocked,' it would be simply laughable, as all locks of all sorts serve just this purpose. This vast mass of words in the claim, while at first glance seeming to restrict the claim, will be found to be entirely misleading, the indisputable scope of the claim being `the simple independently-acting time and combination or key-lock resting against bolt-work of a safe.' That is all \u0097 no more, no less. It is to be carefully noted, that the claim does not restrict to using the locks upon the door, but only `in combination with the bolt-work of the door,' and that the claim covers putting on Little or Derby, in the usual way, a Sargent or other combination-lock.\" After reviewing the various decisions which took place during the pendency of the application of Sargent for his original patent, and showing that the limitation of claims 1 and 2 thereof so as to embrace the peculiar devices of Sargent was what saved them on the question of patentability, the examiner said: \"It very clearly follows, that the claim, expanded so as to omit those restrictions, is entirely untenable, in accordance with the very terms of the commissioner and board decisions.\" The examiners-in-chief, however, on appeal, reversed the examiner's decision, and the reissue was granted.</p>\n<p>It is very clear, from a comparison of the specification of the original patent No. 195,539 with that of reissue No. 7947, that the specification of the original was not defective or insufficient, and that the patent was not inoperative. Not only is there no <span class=\"star-pagination\">*379</span> evidence in this suit to that effect, but the evidence is to the contrary. The sole object of the reissue was manifestly to obtain claim 3 as an enlarged claim. Not only is claim 3 an enlarged claim, but, assuming that it was new and for a patentable combination, and that Sargent would have been entitled to make it in his application for his original patent, he was debarred from making it in his reissue. As has been shown, he made such a claim in May, 1874, and abandoned it. The application on which his patent, No. 195,539, was granted, was pending in the Patent Office from March 12, 1875, to September 25, 1877, and no such claim was made. On the contrary, he struck out from his specification matters evincing an intention to claim something more than the specific devices he had invented; and it is quite evident that the consideration by the Patent Office of those specific devices, and the evidence of invention afforded by them, enabled him to procure his original patent with its limited claims 1 and 2.</p>\n<p>The effect of such an abandonment of a claim upon the validity of a reissue has been often adjudged by this court. <i>Leggett</i> v. <i>Avery,</i> 101 U.S. 256, 259; <i>Mahn</i> v. <i>Harwood,</i> 112 U.S. 354, 359; <i>Cartridge Co.</i> v. <i>Cartridge Co.,</i> 112 U.S. 624, 644; <i>Shepard</i> v. <i>Carrigan,</i> 116 U.S. 593, 597, 598; <i>Roemer</i> v. <i>Peddie,</i> 132 U.S. 313, 317.</p>\n<p>Nor does the fact that reissue No. 7947 was applied for only thirteen days after the grant of the original patent establish its validity. In <i>Coon</i> v. <i>Wilson,</i> 113 U.S. 268, 277, enlarged claims in a reissued patent were declared invalid, although the reissue was applied for a little over three months after the original was granted, on the ground that a clear mistake, inadvertently committed, in the wording of a claim, was necessary, without reference to the length of time. See also <i>Ives</i> v. <i>Sargent,</i> 119 U.S. 652, 663; <i>Parker &amp; Whipple Co.</i> v. <i>Yale Clock Co.,</i> 123 U.S. 87, 103.</p>\n<p>These views dispose of claim 3 of reissue No. 7947, independently of the ground on which the Circuit Court held it to be invalid and all other considerations urged by the defendants.</p>\n<p>We come now to consider claims 1 and 7 of reissue No. 8550 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*380</span> of the Little patent, granted January 21, 1879, on an application filed October 14, 1878.</p>\n<p>The specification, drawings and claims of Little's original patent, No. 146,832, were as follows:</p>\n<p>\"Be it known that I, Samuel A. Little, of Buckland, in the county of Franklin and State of Massachusetts, have made certain new and useful improvements in clock-locks, whereof the following is a specification, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a front view of my improved clock-lock attached to the inside of a safe, adjacent to the hinged part of the safe-door. Fig. 2 shows a seventh-day wheel, marked A in Fig. 1. Fig. 3 shows a cam-wheel, marked B in Fig. 1. Fig. 4 shows a graduated cam-wheel, marked C in Fig. 1. Fig. 5 represents the inside of a safe with the door-bolts locked forward by the lever-dog, which is elevated by the clock-lock. Fig. 6 represents a horizontal section of my clock-lock detached from the clocks, the dog-lever excepted, taken through the line <i>x x</i> of Fig. 1. Fig. 7 represents a vertical section of the same, (similarly detached, except that the clock-wheels to which the same is immediately attached are shown,) taken through the line <i>y y</i> of Fig. 1. In the various figures, similar letters indicate similar parts.</p>\n<p>\"D and E are two clock-movements fastened to the inside, F, of a safe, adjacent to the hinged part of a safe-door, G. Said clock-movements, through the wheels and ratchets K and L, (shown by the dotted lines, Fig. 1,) which are rotated once in twelve hours by the clock, propel the wheels H and I in the same time in the direction of the arrows thereon. The wheels H and I are both geared to the common wheel M, having twice as many teeth as either H or I, and propel the same in the direction of the arrow thereon, so that, while H and I are rotated once in twelve hours, M is rotated once a day. It will therefore be seen that both clocks work together in turning the wheel M, and thereby operating the lock, while, if either clock stops, the wheel H or I of the other will alone continue to rotate the wheel M and operate the lock, as the ratchet allows free motion to the wheel I or H of the other clock, although said clock may be stopped. Forming part of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*381</span> wheel M is the toothed wheel N, which is geared into and drives the toothed wheel O. Forming part of the wheel O is the toothed wheel P, which is geared into and drives the seventh-day wheel A. A has twice as many teeth as P, and O has three and a half times as many teeth as N. Therefore, while M revolves once in a day, it propels A to revolve once in seven days. The wheel C, which is graduated for the hours of the day, is fastened upon the hub <i>a</i> of the wheel M by the projection <i>b,</i> and rotates with the same. On the same hub is the wheel B, which is fastened by friction to C in different positions by the thumb-screw Q, which forms part of the wheel B, and passes through the slot <i>c</i> of the wheel C. <i>p p p p p</i> are pivots, on which the several wheels revolve. The wheel B is cut away on the outer edge, leaving the depression <i>d</i> and the cam-projection <i>e</i> thereon; and the edge of C is similarly cut away, leaving the depression <i>f</i> and the cam-projection <i>g</i> thereon. When the two wheels B and C are fastened together by the thumb-screw Q, side by side, they form one wheel, and have a common depression, <i>h,</i> which may be enlarged or diminished by rotating the wheel B on the wheel A with the thumb-screw, and setting the same, and a common cam or projection <i>i,</i> which may be enlarged or diminished in the same manner. Pivoted near the lock is the two-armed lever, R, whereof one arm carries the roller, S, and is lifted through the same by the cam <i>i,</i> revolving under the same at said cam's inclined plane <i>k,</i> and, at the same time, the other arm, T, of said lever lifts the dog-lever, V, as shown by the dotted lines, Fig. 1, up behind the door-bolts W W W W into the position shown in Fig. 5, thereby locking said bolts forward behind the jamb of the safe so the door cannot be opened. Said dog-lever V is pivoted at <i>l.</i> On the other hand, when the cam <i>i</i> is rotated entirely under the roller S, said roller is suffered to drop by gravity into the depression <i>h</i> at the inclined plane <i>m,</i> which allows the dog-lever V to fall from behind the safe-bolts, and the safe to be opened. The seventh-day wheel A has on its edge a cam-projection, <i>n,</i> which rotates once while the depression <i>h</i> rotates seven times, as described, and is so arranged relatively to the said depression <i>h</i> that, on every</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*382</span> </p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*383</span> </p>\n<p>seventh revolution thereof, it is brought under the roller S, and holds up the lever R while the depression <i>h</i> passes under it, so that every seventh day the same prevents the safe from being unlocked.</p>\n<p>\"From the description aforesaid, the mode of operation will be obvious. The clocks are set to true time by bringing the hour-mark on the dial C under the roller S, which is readily done by turning the dial, as the wheels A, B, C, and M are freely turned in the direction of the arrow on C, inasmuch as the ratchets behind H and I do not interfere with motion in that direction, but take up, and, through the clock's force, proceed with, whatever advance of said wheels may be made. The lock is then set to lock up at any given hour, by loosening the thumb-screw Q and turning the inclined plane <i>k</i> of the wheel B to the mark of the required hour, and then fastening the wheels B and C together by setting the thumb-screw Q.</p>\n<p>\"If it is desired to have the lock open any amount of time earlier than the set time, (nine o'clock,) the wheel C must be turned, as described, until the time indicated under the roller shall be that amount fast of true time, the closing-mark being altered, if desired, to suit the case. If it is desired to open later, the clocks must be stopped until they are slow of time as much as it is desired the lock shall open later than the set time, correcting the closing-mark, if desired.</p>\n<p>\"If the wheels A, B, C, and M are turned, as described, until the cam part <i>n</i> of the wheel A shall be in position to come under the roller S, and keep the lock from opening on Sunday, it will continue to do so on Sunday each week if the clocks run on unchanged. In case that it shall be desired</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*384</span>  <span class=\"star-pagination\">*385</span> that the lock shall not open for a holiday or other day, the said wheels may be rotated until said cam part <i>n</i> is in position to come under and hold up the lever R on said day.</p>\n<p>\"The lock is affixed to the side F of the safe, as described, to avoid derangement or stoppage of the clocks by concussion on the door.</p>\n<p>\"It is evident that the dog-lever V and the lever R may be the same piece. The object in making the same in two parts is to save the weight of the part V, which depends upon the pivot <i>l,</i> from adding to the labor of the clocks.</p>\n<p>\"What I claim as my invention, and for which I pray letters-patent, is \u0097</p>\n<p>\"1. The combination, with one or more clock-movements, of one or more wheels, H I, one or more ratchets, K L, and a common wheel, M, arranged as described, for the purposes set forth.</p>\n<p>\"2. The wheels B and C, with the depressions <i>d</i> and <i>f</i> and the projections <i>e</i> and <i>g,</i> located relatively to each other as described, to increase and diminish the surface of a common cam, <i>i,</i> or depression <i>h,</i> by rotation on each other, for the purposes described.</p>\n<p>\"3. The wheel A with a cam, <i>n,</i> adjusted as described, to prevent the falling of the lever R and dog V, either periodically or at required times, as described.\"</p>\n<p>The specification, claims, and drawings of reissue No. 8550 are as follows:</p>\n<p>\"Be it known that I, Samuel A. Little, of Shelburne, in the county of Franklin and State of Massachusetts, have invented certain new and useful improvements in chronometric locks; and I do hereby declare that the following is a full, clear, and exact description thereof, that will enable others skilled in the art to which it appertains to make and use the same, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, and to the letters of reference marked thereon, which form a part of this specification.</p>\n<p>\"The object of my invention is to construct a time-lock which shall dog and release the multiple bolt-work of a safe or vault at certain predetermined times, both the dogging and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*386</span> releasing being caused by the operation of the time mechanism. By this means the time when the lock will dog the bolt-work depends entirely on the adjustment of the internal mechanism of the lock, hereinafter described.</p>\n<p>\"I provide adjustable devices, so that the periods when the lock shall be locked and unlocked may be varied at will; and I also provide a device whereby, at certain intervals \u0097 say on every seventh day \u0097 the lock will remain locked during the time when ordinarily it would be unlocked.</p>\n<p>\"It will thus be seen that I have constructed a lock which will, of itself, dog and release bolt-work at a regular hour each day, except on certain predetermined days \u0097 Sundays, for example \u0097 when it will remain in the locked position all day. My lock, when once adjusted, is therefore absolutely automatic, requiring no attention except winding, and it is, so far as I am aware, the first time-lock which locks at a time determined by the time mechanism, while at the same time the hours for locking and unlocking can be changed without altering the construction of the lock.</p>\n<p>\"To diminish the chances of accident from the stoppage of the time mechanism, I provide two independent movements, both of which assist in rotating the dial to actuate the lock; but, should one stop, the other will continue to rotate the dial.</p>\n<p>\"The particular construction of my lock is, that the two time-movements rotate a graduated dial so arranged that its motion oscillates, at certain regular determinable intervals, a pivoted bent lever, which in turn, in one instance, for automatic locking, lifts the free part of, and thus oscillates on its stationary pivot, a metallic dog or obstruction, so as to cause it to rest in the way, and prevent the retraction of the sliding bolt-work; and in the other instance, for automatic unlocking, it withdraws its support from under and permits the dog to oscillate by gravity, so as to clear the way for the retraction of the bolt-work.</p>\n<p>\"The adjustability of my lock for locking and unlocking I obtain by means of my dial, which is so arranged that what I may call its `bolt or dog-actuating points' can readily be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*387</span> changed from one position to another, so that they will actuate the dogging mechanism at any desired hours for locking or unlocking; and it is to be noted, that in all continuously running dials, the adjustability for unlocking or locking preferably will be obtained in substantially the same way \u0097 <i>i.e.,</i> by varying the position of the dog-actuating points \u0097 because the dial itself should always be running on correct time.</p>\n<p>\"I cause the lock to remain locked on Sundays or other desired days, by means of a supplemental cam, which temporarily assumes one of the functions of my dial, and by which I can at any desired time cause the lock to remain locked during a greater period than twenty-four hours.</p>\n<p>\"Referring now to the drawings in aid of a description of my lock in detail, figure 1 is a front view of my improved time-lock attached to the inside of a safe, adjacent to the hinge part of the safe-door; Fig. 2, a view of the same, partly in elevation and partly in section, on the line 2 2 of Fig. 1; Fig. 3, a horizontal transverse section thereof on the line 3 3 of Fig. 1, with the upper time-movements removed, showing a plan of the locking mechanism proper; Fig. 4, a horizontal transverse section through the centre of the locking dials; Fig. 5, a perspective view of the interior of a safe, showing the door-bolts locked forward by the lever-dog; Fig. 6, a perspective view of the graduated dial (marked C in Fig. 1); Fig. 7, a similar view of wheel B in Fig. 1; Fig. 8, a similar view of a seventh-day wheel (marked A in Fig. 1).</p>\n<p>\"D and E designate two time-movements fastened to the inside, F, of a safe, adjacent to the hinged part of the safe-door G. These time-movements, through the wheels and ratchets K and L, propel the wheels H and I in the direction of the arrows thereon. These wheels H and I rotate once in twelve hours, and are both geared to the common wheel M, which has twice as many teeth as either of them, and they propel it in the direction of the arrow thereon, so that while wheels H and I are rotated once in twelve hours, wheel M is rotated only once a day.</p>\n<p>\"It will be seen that both time-movements work together <span class=\"star-pagination\">*388</span> in turning the wheel M, and thereby operate the lock; but if either accidentally stops, the wheel H or I of the other will alone continue to rotate the wheel M and operate the lock, because each ratchet will allow free motion to either wheel I or H, in the absence of its normal impelling force.</p>\n<p>\"The toothed wheel N, forming part of the wheel M, is geared into and drives the toothed wheel O. The toothed wheel P, forming part of the wheel O, is geared into and drives the seventh-day wheel A, which turns loosely on the hub <i>a</i> of the wheel M. This wheel A has twice as many teeth as wheel P, and wheel O has three and a half times as many teeth as wheel N. Therefore, while wheel M revolves once in a day, it only causes wheel A to revolve once in seven days. The wheel C, which is graduated for the hours of the day, is fastened rigidly upon the hub <i>a</i> by means of the projection <i>b</i> and rotates with it. Loose on the same hub is the wheel B, which may be fastened by friction to the wheel C in different positions by the thumb-screw Q, that is attached to, or forms part of, the wheel B, and passes through the slot <i>c</i> of the wheel C.</p>\n<p>\"<i>p p p p p</i> designate pivots, on which the several wheels revolve. The wheel B is cut away on its periphery, leaving the depression <i>d</i> and the cam projection <i>e,</i> and the periphery of the wheel C is similarly cut away, leaving the depression <i>f</i> and the cam projection <i>g,</i> of the same form and size as the depression and projection of the wheel B. When these two wheels are fastened together by the thumb-screw Q side by side, they form one wheel or dial, having a depression <i>h,</i> which may be enlarged or diminished by rotating the wheel B by means of the thumb-screw, and then setting it, and also having a cam or projection, <i>i,</i> which may be enlarged or diminished in the same manner. Pivoted near its middle to the lock-case is the bent lever R, one arm of which carries the friction-roller S, and is lifted by the cam <i>i,</i> revolving under the roller at the cam's inclined plane <i>k,</i> and at the same time the other arm, T, of said lever lifts the dog V, pivoted at <i>l,</i> up behind the door-bolts W W W W into the position shown in Fig. 5, thereby locking the bolts forward behind the jamb of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*389</span> the safe, so that the door cannot be opened. In due time, when the cam <i>i</i> is rotated entirely from under the roller S, the latter will drop into the depression <i>h</i> at the inclined plane <i>m,</i> which allows the dog V to fall from behind the safe-bolts, when they may be retracted and the safe opened.</p>\n<p>\"It will be noted that the dog always tends to turn on its pivot automatically by gravity, so as to present a free space for the retraction of the bolt-work, and it is held up only for predetermined periods, to be measured by the time mechanism, by the bent lever.</p>\n<p>\"The seventh-day wheel A has on its periphery a cam projection, <i>n,</i> which rotates once while the depression <i>h</i> rotates seven times, as described, and it is so arranged relatively to the depression <i>h,</i> that on every seventh revolution thereof it is brought under the roller S and holds up the lever R, while the depression <i>h</i> passes under it, so that every seventh day this projection <i>n</i> prevents the safe from being unlocked.</p>\n<p>\"From the foregoing description the mode of operation will be obvious.</p>\n<p>\"The time-movements should be set to correct time by bringing the hour-mark on the dial C under the roller S, which is readily done by turning the dial, as the wheels A, B, C, and M turn freely in the direction of the arrow on wheel C, because the ratchets behind wheels H and I do not interfere with motion in that direction, but take up, and, through the force of the time-movements, proceed with, whatever advance of said wheels may be made. The lock should then be set to lock up at any given hour by loosening the thumb-screw Q, and turning the inclined plane <i>k</i> of the wheel B to the mark of the required hour, and then fastening the wheels B and C together by setting the thumb-screw Q. The dial will then indicate the time of locking and unlocking, and the operation of the time-movements will cause the oscillation of the dog into position to obstruct the retraction of the bolt-work in a little time, or at whatever time may have been decided upon, and it will be held there until the time arrives for unlocking, when the continued operation of the time-movements will withdraw its support, and it will fall out of the way.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*390</span> \"If it is desired to have the safe opened any given amount of time earlier than the set time, \u0097 say 9 o'clock, \u0097 the wheel C must be turned, as described, until the time indicated under the roller shall be that amount fast of the correct time, the closing-mark being altered, if desired, to suit the case. If it is desired to open later, the clocks must be stopped until they are slow of the time as much as it is desired the lock shall open later than the set time, correcting the closing-mark, if desired.</p>\n<p>\"If the wheels A, B, C, and M, are turned, as described, until the cam part <i>n</i> of the wheel A shall be in a position to come under the roller S and keep the lock from opening on Sunday, it will continue to do so on Sunday each week, if the time-movements run on unchanged. Thus, the necessity for setting the mechanism on every Saturday, so that it shall keep the safe locked over Sunday, is obviated, which is a great convenience to bankers, and is, furthermore, a security against neglect to set the mechanism weekly, which might sometimes occur. In case it shall be desired that the lock shall not open for a holiday or other day, the said wheels may be rotated until the cam projection <i>n</i> is in position to come under the roller S and hold up the lever R on such day.</p>\n<p>\"The lock is affixed to the side F of the safe, as described, to avoid derangement or stoppage of the time-movements by concussion on the door; but it is obvious that it may be affixed to the door without modifying its construction, if desired, that being merely a change of location.</p>\n<p>\"It is evident that the dog V and the lever R may be one and the same piece. The object of making them in two parts is to save the weight of the part V, which depends upon the pivot <i>l,</i> from adding to the labor of the time movements, and also to make the dog or obstruction entirely distinct from the time mechanism.</p>\n<p>\"I am aware of the patent granted to Williams and Cummings, No. 17,245, and dated May 5, 1857, and do not claim anything shown therein, but intend to limit my claims to comprehend only the improvements I have made over the peculiar combinations shown in that patent, whereby I reduce the number, modify the construction, change the relative <span class=\"star-pagination\">*391</span> position and mode of operation of the parts, and simplify my mechanical organization, as will fully appear by comparison.</p>\n<p>\"What I claim as my invention is \u0097</p>\n<p>\"1.

They take the place of claim 2 of the original patent. They were before Judge Shipman in the cases in 19 Blatchford and 6 Fed. Rep. above referred to, and he held that they covered new inventions and patentable improvements. Judge Lowell, in his opinion in the present case, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*397</span> states that he fully agrees with the views of Judge Shipman as to the novelty and patentability of claims 1 and 7. Although the defendants' lock has but one time-movement to control the lever which controls the dog, Judge Lowell held that that did not affect the question of the infringement of claims 1 and 7.</p>\n<p>In September, 1887, in <i>Yale Lock Mfg. Co.</i> v. <i>New Haven Savings Bank,</i> 32 Fed. Rep. 167, in the Circuit Court for the District of Connecticut, Judge Shipman had before him the question of a rehearing as to the validity of claims 1 and 7, and especially the question whether claim 7 was an enlargement of claim 2 of the original patent. He held that claim 7 \"should be limited to the invention which was described and claimed in the original patent, which invention was not confined to a `common cam,' or to a device which was connected with the compound wheel in the same way in which the cam was connected, but was broad enough to include equivalent means of connection with the dog.\" He held also that the owners of the patent had not abandoned, by proceedings in the Patent Office in respect to the two prior reissues of it, their right to claim, in reissue No. 8550, a double or compound disc, and to obtain a valid patent therefor.</p>\n<p>Claims 1 and 7 were sustained also by Judge Sage, in the Circuit Court for the Western Division of the Southern District of Ohio, in May, 1889, in the case of <i>Yale &amp; Towne Mfg. Co.</i> v. <i>Consolidated Time-Lock Co.,</i> 38 Fed. Rep. 917.</p>\n<p>This patent, as before stated, was reissued May 9, 1876, as No. 7104, and again, January 8, 1878, as No. 8035. The lock used by the defendants is made under letters patent No. 173,121, granted to Henry Gross, February 8, 1876, for an \"improvement in time-attachments for locks.\" This patent was issued prior to the granting of any reissue of the Little patent. While the original patent, No. 146,832, had only three claims, reissue No. 7104 had eight claims, reissue No. 8035 had six claims, and reissue No. 8550 has seventeen claims. On comparing the various reissues with the original patent, it is found that the drawings and the description of them are substantially the same in all, with some changes in nomenclature; and it is quite apparent that the original patent was not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*398</span> inoperative or invalid by reason of a defective or insufficient specification, within the terms of the statute, so as to warrant the reissues.</p>\n<p>There is in the record a copy of the file-wrapper and contents of reissue No. 8035, applied for December 15, 1877, and granted January 8, 1878. The specification presented with the application contained only two claims, both of which made \"a revolving dial\" an essential element. On the 18th of December, 1877, an entirely new specification and claims were put in, the claims being ten in number. Claim 3 was as follows: \"3. In a time-lock, the combination, substantially as above set forth, of the clock-work and two adjustable devices for determining, respectively, the times of locking and unlocking.\" That claim 3 is very similar to claim 7 of reissue No. 8550. On the 21st of December, 1877, that claim 3 was amended by striking out the word \"clock-work,\" and inserting the words \"time-movements,\" so that it became almost exactly the same as claim 7 of reissue No. 8550. On the 26th of December, 1877, that claim 3 was erased.</p>\n<p>Claim 4 of reissue No. 8035, as originally applied for, read as follows: \"The combination with one or more time-movements, of one or more wheels, H I, one or more ratchets, K L, and a common wheel, M, arranged as described, for the purposes set forth.\" This claim 4 was erased with claim 3, and in their place there was inserted the following as claim 3: \"The combination with the time-movements of the wheels H I, the ratchets K L, and the common wheel, M, arranged as described, for the purpose set forth.\"</p>\n<p>Claim 5 of reissue No. 8035, as applied for, was identical with claim 2 of the original patent, No. 146,832, as granted. That claim 5 was rejected by the examiner, on the ground that it was old in valve-gear for steam engines, with a reference to a prior patent; and on the 26th of December, 1877, it was erased and abandoned. Therefore, more than a year before reissue No. 8550 was granted, claim 2 of the original patent was abandoned by Little; and at the same time he also abandoned claim 3 of his application, after he had put it in such shape that it became substantially the same as claim 7 of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*399</span> reissue No. 8550. Reissue No. 8035 was taken out without those claims. No one of the six claims of reissue No. 8035 was infringed by the lock of the defendants, which was applied to use during the existence of reissue No. 8035. A little over nine months after it was granted, the application for reissue No. 8550 was filed; and the present suit was brought eight days after that reissue was granted.</p>\n<p>In the specification of reissue No. 8035, the following statements were made: \"The object of my invention is to construct a time-lock, and to combine it with the multiple sliding bolt-work of a safe or vault-door, so that, by the continuous movement of its time mechanism, locking and unlocking will be effected daily or periodically... . The gist of my invention, therefore, is the combination, in a time-lock, of time mechanism revolving a graduated dial, which serves to oscillate a pivoted bent lever, that, in turn, induces the oscillation of a pivoted dog or obstruction to the retraction of the multiple sliding bolt-work. Subordinate to this main principle or chief organization of my time-lock, I provide that my dial shall be composite in its construction, whereby I obtain what I term a `differential cam' for convenience of adjustment.\" These statements do not appear in the specification of reissue No. 8550. In the latter specification, what had been previously called \"a revolving graduated dial\" is called \"adjustable devices;\" the dial is said to have \"bolt or dog-actuating points;\" and a statement is made that the lock of Little \"is, so far as I am aware, the first time-lock which locks at a time determined by the time mechanism, while at the same time the hours for locking and unlocking can be changed without altering the construction of the lock.\" So that, in this reissue, which was granted almost five years after the date of the original patent, and over three years after the Gross patent was issued, the attempt is made by Little to cover all devices for determining the time of locking and unlocking, on the view that he was the first to invent a lock that would lock up as well as unlock at a predetermined time. This attempt is embodied in claims 1 and 7 of reissue No. 8550, which are here repeated: \"1. The combination of independent multiple <span class=\"star-pagination\">*400</span> bolt-work with the time mechanism and locking or dogging mechanism of a time-lock, automatically both dogging and releasing the bolt-work at predetermined times, substantially as described.\" \"7. In a time-lock, the combination, substantially as above set forth, of the time movements and two adjustable devices, one for determining the time of locking, and the other of unlocking.\"</p>\n<p>Although the first reissue, No. 7104, was applied for March 15, 1876, more than two months after the Gross patent was issued, no such claims as the above were applied for or taken, nor were they taken in reissue No. 8035. Claims 3, 7 and 8 of reissue No. 7104 were abandoned in reissue No. 8035, and severally appear as claims 7, 16 and 17, in reissue No. 8550, claim 7 in No. 8550 being in these words, as claim 3, in No. 7104: \"3. In a chronometric locking mechanism, the combination, substantially as before set forth, of the clock-work and two adjustable devices for determining, respectively, the time of locking and unlocking.\" Claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 and 11 in No. 8550 are entirely new. Claim 2 of the original patent, No. 146,832, was not retained in No. 8550, and only two claims out of the seventeen in No. 8550 are found in the original patent.</p>\n<p>Infringement is alleged of claim 1 of reissue No. 8550, which is an entirely new claim, not found in the original patent or in any prior reissue, and of claim 7, which was claim 3 in reissue No. 7104, and was first amended and then abandoned in the application for reissue No. 8035. If claim 1 of reissue No. 8550 is construed to cover only the specific devices of Little, operating in the mode described by him, and thus is no broader than claim 2 of the original patent, the defendants' lock does not infringe it. If it is not so limited, it is void, under numerous decisions of this court.</p>\n<p>In Little's time-lock, there is a compound cam-wheel or disc, composed of two cam-wheels placed face to face on the same axis, each having a portion of its outer edge cut away, and so arranged that they can be turned with relation to each other so as to increase the length of their common projection or common depression, and be fastened together in any desired <span class=\"star-pagination\">*401</span> position by means of a slot and a thumb-screw in one of them. When adjusted, this compound cam-wheel is revolved by clock-work and made alternately to lift up and let down a lever which in turn lifts up or lets down another lever, the end of which is supported in a position behind one of the bolts of the door, or is allowed to drop away from behind it, thus alternately dogging and releasing the bolt. It is the office of the common projection on the wheels to lift, and then hold up, the levers in the dogging position; and the length of time the bolts will remain dogged depends solely on the length of the common projection.</p>\n<p>In the defendants' lock there is only one time-movement, and there are no wheels of any kind, much less wheels like the cam-wheels B and C of Little's original patent, with projections and depressions, which can be rotated so as to increase and diminish the surface of a common cam or depression; nor has it any cam projection or cam depression of any kind, formed in any manner, whose office is to lift and hold up and let fall a lever, and thus dog and release the bolt of a safe-door; nor has it a device of any kind capable of performing the function of Little's cam-wheels. Little does not describe or suggest, in his original patent, any way by which he can dispense with the use of his cam projections to lift and hold up the dog; and he confines claim 2 of his original patent to a combination in which two cam-wheels, capable of being rotated and adjusted with relation to each other, so as to increase and diminish the surface of a common cam, for the purpose of lifting and holding up the dog, are essential.</p>\n<p>Claim 7 of reissue No. 8550 was evidently drawn so as to cover the time-attachment of the defendants' lock, which does not itself lock up or unlock the bolt-work, but only determines the time when the bolt work may be unlocked by the combination-lock. Claim 7 is not limited to devices which automatically lock and unlock, but extends to devices which merely interfere with mechanical locking and unlocking. Such a construction of claim 7, a claim once abandoned in the Patent Office and restored in this reissue, cannot be admitted in consistency with numerous decisions of this court on the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*402</span> subject of reissues. If, however, claim 7 is so construed as to be no broader than claim 2 of the original patent, then the defendants' lock, as it did not infringe the latter claim, does not infringe claim 7.</p>\n<p>It is shown that it was old to use time mechanism, revolving dials with adjustable devices, pivoted levers and dogs, to lock and unlock door-bolts; and that the combination of clock-work, adjustable cam-wheels, and a two-armed lever oscillated thereby, was old. In this view, in his original patent, Little very properly limited his claims to his mode of connecting two clocks with a common wheel, so that both could act together in turning it, and either one could turn it alone in case the other stopped; and to the employment of the specific cam-wheels with depressions and projections so located as to increase and diminish the surface of a common cam by rotation on each other, so as to lift and hold up the dog behind the bolt of the door; and to the introduction of his Sunday wheel. The lock of the defendants did not infringe any of the claims of the original patent, because it did not have the two clocks, the Sunday wheel, the cam-wheels or any mechanical equivalent therefor, and did not move the dog automatically into the dogging position.</p>\n<p>The application for reissue No. 7104 was made more than two years after the original patent was granted, and one month and seven days after the Gross patent was issued, containing the devices which are employed in the defendants' lock. Reissue No. 8550 was applied for nearly four years and nine months after the original patent was granted, and more than two years and eight months after the Gross patent was issued, and after the lock of the defendants had been put into use. No excuse is shown for these delays; nor is there any defect or insufficiency in the specification of the original patent. In December, 1877, during the pendency of the application for reissue No. 8035, Little acquiesced in the rejection, for want of novelty, of claim 2 of his original patent, and then abandoned a claim corresponding with claim 7 of reissue No. 8550, and took out reissue No. 8035 without such claim.</p>\n<p>The lock of the defendants did not infringe any claim of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*403</span> reissue No. 8035. Claim 1 of reissue No. 8550 is entirely new, and claim 7 of that reissue is the same as claim 3 of the application for reissue No. 8035, which claim was first amended and then abandoned. It was not lawful to introduce claim 7 into reissue No. 8550, after such formal abandonment of it. If either claim 1 or claim 7 of reissue No. 8550 covers a device which would not have been covered by claim 2 of the original patent, or by any of the claims of reissue No. 8035, it is invalid; and even if claims 1 and 7 could properly be restricted to the cam-wheels of the specification or their mechanical equivalents, operating as described, as claim 2 of the original patent was restricted, the lock of the defendants does not infringe either claim 1 or claim 7.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, it must be held that the plaintiffs have no cause of action against the defendants under claims 1 and 7 of reissue No. 8550.</p>\n<p><i>It results that the decree of February 12, 1886, must be affirmed so far as it relates to the Sargent reissue No. 7947, and reversed so far as it relates to the Little reissue No. 8550, and the cause be remanded to the Circuit Court with a direction to dismiss the bill of complaint, with costs to the defendants. As the plaintiffs fail in this court on both appeals, they are to pay the costs of this court on both appeals.</i></p>\n</div>",

Cochran</i> for the Berkshire National Bank and Hall's executors.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BLATCHFORD delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>This is a suit in equity, brought January 29, 1879, in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Massachusetts, by the Yale Lock Manufacturing Company, a Connecticut corporation, and James Sargent and Halbert S. Greenleaf, composing the firm of Sargent &amp; Greenleaf, against the Berkshire National Bank, a national banking corporation doing business at North Adams, in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>The suit was brought for the infringement of two reissued letters patent. One of them is reissue No. 7947, granted November 13, 1877, to James Sargent, as inventor, for an \"improvement in combined time-lock, combination lock, and bolt-work for safes,\" on an application filed October 3, 1877, the original patent, No. 195,539, having been granted to Sargent, September 25, 1877. Only claim 3 of reissue No. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*344</span> 7947 is alleged to have been infringed. The other reissue is No. 8550, granted to the Yale Lock Manufacturing Company, January 21, 1879, on an application filed October 14, 1878, for an \"improvement in time-locks,\" the original patent, No. 146,832, having been granted to Samuel A. Little, as inventor, January 27, 1874, and having been reissued as No. 7104, to the Yale Lock Manufacturing Company, May 9, 1876, and again reissued to that company, as No. 8035, January 8, 1878. Only claims 1 and 7 of reissue No. 8550 are alleged to have been infringed.</p>\n<p>After the filing of the bill, and by agreement of the parties, Joseph L. Hall, of Cincinnati, Ohio, was admitted as a defendant. An amended bill was filed, and the bank and Hall answered it. As to both reissues, the answer denied that, before they were granted, the patents were inoperative by reason of a defective or insufficient specification; that any errors arose by inadvertency, accident and mistake; that any reissues were necessary or are valid; and that the reissues were for the same inventions as were shown and described in the original patents. It also set up want of novelty and non-infringement.</p>\n<p>After replication, proofs were taken on both sides, and the case was heard in the Circuit Court by Judge Lowell. His opinion is reported in 17 Fed. Rep. 531. He held that claim 3 of the Sargent reissue, No. 7947, was invalid, and ordered a decree for the plaintiffs as to claims 1 and 7 of the Little reissue, No. 8550. On the 14th of August, 1883, an interlocutory decree was entered, adjudging reissue No. 8550 to be valid, as to claims 1 and 7; that the defendants had infringed those claims; and ordering a reference to a master to take an account of profits and to report damages.</p>\n<p>In July, 1884, the defendants were allowed to amend their answer by setting up an additional anticipation of the Little patent, proofs were taken thereon, and the case was reheard, before Judge Colt, on the new evidence. He affirmed the former decree, in an opinion reported in 26 Fed. Rep. 104.</p>\n<p>The master reported $60 damages in favor of the plaintiffs, and both parties excepted to the report. A final decree was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*345</span> entered on the 12th of February, 1886, confirming the report, overruling the exceptions of both parties and adjudging a recovery in favor of the plaintiffs for $60 damages and certain costs, dismissing the bill as to the Sargent reissue, No. 7947, and awarding a perpetual injunction as to claims 1 and 7 of the Little reissue, No. 8550. From this decree both parties have appealed. Joseph L. Hall having died, his executors and trustees have been made parties in his place.</p>\n<p>The respective specifications and claims of the original Sargent patent, No. 195,539, and of its reissue, No. 7947, are set forth below in parallel columns, the parts in each which are not found in the other being in italic.

Rep. 377. He held that claim 3 covered a new and patentable invention and was valid. On the question of the validity of the reissue as to claim 3, he said: \"It is next urged that the third claim of the reissue is void, because it was abandoned by the patentee upon the objection of the Patent Office, when the original application was pending. In Sargent's original application he made one broad claim. The application was rejected by the examiner, whose decision was reversed by the board of examiners. The examiner then requested that a new application be made, upon the ground that the case presented to the board was not the same case which had been presented to him. A new application was made, containing only the first two claims of the reissue. Then followed a long and earnestly contested litigation in the Patent Office between various interfering applicants, in which, apparently, both patentability and priority were discussed. The Little application contained the broad claim, and the board of examiners said, at one stage of the litigation, whether this question was properly before them or not, that this claim was patentable; so that, when the question came before them upon appeal from the decision of the examiner against the Sargent reissue, the board say: `The claim in controversy is the same, in substance, as the first claim of Little, whose application was once in interference with Sargent, and which was admitted to be patentable by the Office at the time of the declaration of the interference. The patentability of Little's claim has once been before us in the aforesaid interference, and, after full argument, we concluded that his claim was tenable, and held that some one who was first to combine with the bolt-work on a vault or safe-door, a key-lock and time-lock acting independently of each other, but jointly upon the bolt-work, might have a valid patent therefor.' These facts exclude the third claim from the decision, or the <i>dicta,</i> in the case of <i>Leggett</i> v. <i>Avery,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90121\"><a href=\"/opinion/90121/leggett-v-avery/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span>. I do not understand that the objection that the reissue is for a different invention from the original was pressed by either of the counsel for the defendant. It is sufficient to say, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*372</span> that the claims of the original were for the combination of the third claim, provided with a device whereby the bolt-work may be retained in the unlocked position, for shutting the door, and be automatically locked by the time-lock and mechanically by the key-lock when the bolt-work is cast. The patentee had shown `means whereby' but, if I have been correct thus far, the gist of his invention consisted, not in that device, but in the triple combination. Other different `devices whereby,' could be introduced by other inventors, which would destroy the value of his patent, if it was unduly limited. As said by the board of examiners, `means whereby,' while being essential to the convenient use of this combination, is merely incidental to the main idea, and may be varied indefinitely without departing from the spirit and scope of the applicant's invention.\"</p>\n<p>The only remark made by Judge Lowell, in his opinion in the present case, as to the validity of reissue No. 7947, as respects claim 3, is, that the patent \"was reissued so soon after its granting that it is not obnoxious to the objection of undue delay.\" The application for the reissue was filed 13 days after the original patent was issued, and the reissue was granted 36 days after the application for it was filed. Judge Lowell held claim 3 to be invalid on the ground that, if it was a claim irrespective of any particular means for carrying it out it was void as a patent for a principle, independently of the state of the art; and that, in view of the state of the art, it was void. He was of opinion, that there was no patentable novelty in putting a time-lock, which was old, in place of one of two combination locks, where two combination locks had been before used to dog one combined bolt-work; that it was not patentable to substitute a well-known multiple bolt-work for two such bolt-works, where a time-lock and a combination lock had been before combined in the use of two multiple bolt-works; and that there was no patentable novelty in combining two locks with a single door.</p>\n<p>A history of the proceedings in the Patent Office in regard to patent No. 195,539 and reissue No. 7947, shows that claim 3 of that reissue must be held to be invalid.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*373</span> On the 9th of May, 1874, Sargent filed an application for a patent which claimed broadly the combination of a time-lock, an ordinary lock and a safe-bolt connected with both of them. The claim he made was as follows: \"What I claim is the combination, with a clock or time-movement lock and an ordinary lock, attached independently to a safe or vault-door, of a safe-bolt constructed so as to rest against or connect with both of said locks, substantially as described, whereby the safe-bolt cannot be withdrawn till both locks have been unlocked.\"</p>\n<p>In the specification he then filed he said: \"This improvement belongs to that class in which two locks are applied upon a safe or vault-door for the purpose of preventing the withdrawal of the safe-bolt till both locks have been unlocked... . I employ one ordinary combination or key-lock and one time-movement or clock-lock, attached independently to the door, and employ in combination therewith a safe-bolt that bears against or connects with both of said locks in such a manner that though the ordinary lock may be picked or opened, yet the clock-lock cannot be reached, and the safe-bolt therefore cannot be released till the clock has performed its office and unlocked its lock at the predetermined hour... . But it is by no means essential to this invention that the circular form of lock-bolt should be used, as the ordinary style of sliding-bolt, or other forms of shifting bearings, could be employed, if desired... . Clock-locks have before been used both separately and in connection with combination locks. Where used alone they are insecure, for the reason that burglars, ascertaining the hour upon which the lock is set, may, by confining or disabling the officers of the bank having control of the same, open the safe when the hour arrives. In my improvement such result cannot occur, because the combination lock still locks the safe. Where clock-locks have been combined with ordinary locks heretofore, so far as I am aware, the said locks have been connected by a lever or other connection, so that their actions are dependent on each other. In such case, if the combination or key-lock is injured by a lock-pick, by violence or otherwise, the clock-lock is liable to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*374</span> injury also. By making these independent, as described, I avoid these difficulties.\"</p>\n<p>This application was rejected by the examiner, but, on appeal, his decision was overruled by the examiners-in-chief, February 17, 1875. The examiner then ascertained that the case had been argued before the examiners-in-chief on an invention which had not been before the examiner, and that another model was used before the examiners-in-chief in place of the one properly in the case. The new feature of invention was a device by which the time-lock could be properly set and the door then be closed; but that device, which made the invention an operative one, was not shown in the drawing, the specification or the model, which had been before the examiner. In a communication made to Sargent by the examiner at the time, February 20, 1875, he said: \"As far as the Office knows by the record of the case, this new invention may not have been contemporaneous with the first one. The examiner would suggest that a new case be at once filed embodying this invention, which makes the devices operative, and against the patentability of which no question will be raised. The claim, however, must be not broadly for A combined with C, which is not conceded to be entirely inoperative, but A and B combined either with C or some mechanical equivalent thereof, which alone makes A and B operative.\" He also said: \"It is suggested to applicant that he file a new case introducing the new combining device which allows the door to be shut after the time-lock is set, and thus takes it out from the new reference cited, and the examiner will, in all proper ways, hasten the case forward upon a legitimate claim for A and B with suitable combining device to allow the door to be closed after the time-lock is set, inasmuch as no obstacle exists, as the examiner is at present advised.\"</p>\n<p>In accordance with this suggestion, Sargent, on the 10th of March, 1875, filed a new application, which resulted in the granting of patent No. 195,539. The specification of this application said: \"In locking the safe or vault-door, some device is necessary to allow the door-bolt to remain back in the unlocked position until the door is closed, without interfering <span class=\"star-pagination\">*375</span> with the clock-lock. [A variety of devices may be employed for this purpose.]\" This clause in brackets was afterwards erased.</p>\n<p>The specification of this application also said: \"In Fig. 1 is shown another device for the same purpose, situated outside the lock, which is the subject matter of another application. It consists of a socket or bearing, <i>h,</i> attached to the tie-piece, E, of the door-bolt, and sliding on an independent stud, <i>a',</i> resting against the lock-bolt. A spring locking-pin, <i>i,</i> is used to connect the parts, when the door-bolt is thrown forward to connect with the jamb. In this case, the lock-bolt, D, may be made solid, and may be either of the turning or sliding kind. [Other devices might be used to allow the door to shut. I do not wish to confine myself to any particular form of the device.]\" The sentences in brackets were afterwards erased.</p>\n<p>Sargent thus limited himself to combinations wherein one or the other of the peculiar devices invented by him should be an essential element, which is further evidenced by the fact that, in claim 1, as accepted by him, the combination of the clock-lock and combination lock, as applied to the door-bolt, was to be provided with a device whereby the door-bolt might be retained in the unlocked position for shutting the door; and in claim 2, the same combination was to be provided with a lock-bolt having an opening or an offset which was automatically brought in and out of coincidence with the tongue of the door-bolt, whereby the latter might be retained in the unlocked position for shutting the door.</p>\n<p>On the 16th of March, 1875, the examiner rejected claim 1, saying that it was to be found substantially in the patent granted to Cornell, August 10, 1858, for \"safe bolt-work,\" and referring also to three prior patents for time-locks, and adding, that \"merely to substitute either one of the above time-locks for one of the locks shown in Cornell's patent, is not regarded as a patentable difference.\" To this Sargent's attorney replied, on the 17th of March, 1875: \"The combination is such as to require something else to be done other than to simply substitute for one of the key-locks shown in Cornell's patent one of the time-locks cited by the examiner\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*376</span> This referred to the devices invented by Sargent, by which his combination was made operative.</p>\n<p>On the 19th of March, 1875, Sargent's attorney struck out the parts in brackets, before quoted, and also struck out claim 1 and substituted as claim 1 what is claim 2 in the original patent as granted. On March 20, 1875, the attorney reinstated claim 1, and added as claim 2 what is claim 2 in the original patent.</p>\n<p>On the 22d of March, 1875, the examiner rejected both of the claims, on the references before made, and referred also to the English patent to W. Rutherford, of April 14, 1831. He added, that \"a rotating lock-bolt having an opening or an offset is not new,\" and referred especially to two prior patents, and said: \"The second claim may possibly be allowed if amended by inserting the words `constructed in two parts and' after `lock-bolt.'\"</p>\n<p>An appeal was taken from this decision, and on the 27th of March, 1875, the board of examiners-in-chief reversed the decision of the examiner, doing so on the ground that the combination embracing Sargent's peculiar devices for retaining the door-bolt in an unlocked position, for shutting the door, were new and patentable. Before Sargent's patent could issue, he was put into interference with Stockwell, Burge and Little, and also with Pillard and Lillie. It is evident, from decisions made by the examiner of interferences, and by the Commissioner of Patents, in questions arising in some of these interferences, that Sargent was regarded as making no claim to a broad combination between the bolt-work of a door, and a time-lock, and an independent non-time-lock, which is the subject matter of claim 3 of reissue No. 7947.</p>\n<p>The examiner, the examiners-in-chief and the Commissioner of Patents decided priority of invention in favor of Sargent, as to the combination, by Sargent, of the bolt-work, with a time-lock, and a non-time-lock, and his device for retaining the door-bolt in its retracted position, for shutting the door without interfering with the lock mechanism. The patent No. 195,539 was then issued, on September 25, 1877, with the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*377</span> two claims before set forth, limited by the proceedings which so took place in the Patent Office.</p>\n<p>The lock of the defendants did not infringe either of the two claims of the original patent, for it did not contain what is called in claim 1 \"a device whereby the door-bolt may be retained in the unlocked position for shutting the door,\" after the time-lock is set; nor did it contain what is called in claim 2 \"a lock-bolt having an opening or an offset which is automatically brought in and out of coincidence with the tongue of the door-bolt.\" This is apparent from the fact that it is not contended that the defendants' lock infringes either claim 1 or claim 2 of reissue No. 7947, which two claims are substantially identical with claims 1 and 2 of the original patent.</p>\n<p>On the 8th of October, 1877, Sargent filed an application for a reissue of patent No. 195,539. He inserted in his specification what is claim 3 of the reissue as granted. That claim is as broad as the claim made in his application of May 9, 1874, which, as before shown, he abandoned. The examiner rejected this claim twice, and after the second rejection, and on the 26th of October, 1877, Sargent appealed to the examiners-in-chief. In the statement of appeal his attorney said: \"All time-locks used with bolt-work must have some mechanical arrangement to enable the bolt-work to be retracted for closing the door. Such is present in many old patents, and has never been claimed by my client; but what is claimed by him is for the union of such an old, well-known time-lock with a combination lock and bolt-work all arranged on the same door.\" This shows the breadth of the claim, as compared with claims 1 and 2 of the original patent.</p>\n<p>The examiner, in his answer to the reasons of appeal, said: \"Leaving out the descriptive and recitative parts of the claim as well as all superfluous and misleading matter, we have as the claim, the following elements and arrangements, viz.: A combination or key-lock, and a time-lock, combined with the bolt-work of a safe-door, both used independently and resting against or connecting with the bolt-work. The only elements are the two locks and the bolt-work, no other element being hinted at even, and the arrangement of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*378</span> said elements is, that the locks rest against or connect with bolt-work and are used independently of each other. To recite, in the claim, that the `key-lock is controllable from the outside' and the `time-lock upon the inside only' is entirely unnecessary, for all key or combination locks of safes are controlled only from the outside, and all time-locks, as a matter of course, upon the inside, are automatically unlocked. It is a well-settled principle that a mere explanation of parts or recital of functions neither adds to nor takes away from a claim. All the matter which recites that the door cannot be opened until the lock allows it is a mere superfluity. If, in an ordinary lock patent, we were to add to the claim `the arrangement being such that the door cannot be opened until it is unlocked,' it would be simply laughable, as all locks of all sorts serve just this purpose. This vast mass of words in the claim, while at first glance seeming to restrict the claim, will be found to be entirely misleading, the indisputable scope of the claim being `the simple independently-acting time and combination or key-lock resting against bolt-work of a safe.' That is all \u0097 no more, no less. It is to be carefully noted, that the claim does not restrict to using the locks upon the door, but only `in combination with the bolt-work of the door,' and that the claim covers putting on Little or Derby, in the usual way, a Sargent or other combination-lock.\" After reviewing the various decisions which took place during the pendency of the application of Sargent for his original patent, and showing that the limitation of claims 1 and 2 thereof so as to embrace the peculiar devices of Sargent was what saved them on the question of patentability, the examiner said: \"It very clearly follows, that the claim, expanded so as to omit those restrictions, is entirely untenable, in accordance with the very terms of the commissioner and board decisions.\" The examiners-in-chief, however, on appeal, reversed the examiner's decision, and the reissue was granted.</p>\n<p>It is very clear, from a comparison of the specification of the original patent No. 195,539 with that of reissue No. 7947, that the specification of the original was not defective or insufficient, and that the patent was not inoperative. Not only is there no <span class=\"star-pagination\">*379</span> evidence in this suit to that effect, but the evidence is to the contrary. The sole object of the reissue was manifestly to obtain claim 3 as an enlarged claim. Not only is claim 3 an enlarged claim, but, assuming that it was new and for a patentable combination, and that Sargent would have been entitled to make it in his application for his original patent, he was debarred from making it in his reissue.

The application on which his patent, No. 195,539, was granted, was pending in the Patent Office from March 12, 1875, to September 25, 1877, and no such claim was made. On the contrary, he struck out from his specification matters evincing an intention to claim something more than the specific devices he had invented; and it is quite evident that the consideration by the Patent Office of those specific devices, and the evidence of invention afforded by them, enabled him to procure his original patent with its limited claims 1 and 2.</p>\n<p>The effect of such an abandonment of a claim upon the validity of a reissue has been often adjudged by this court. <i>Leggett</i> v. <i>Avery,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90121\"><a href=\"/opinion/90121/leggett-v-avery/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span>, 259; <i>Mahn</i> v. <i>Harwood,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91215\"><a href=\"/opinion/91215/mahn-v-harwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">354</span></a></span>, 359; <i>Cartridge Co.</i> v. <i>Cartridge Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91238\"><a href=\"/opinion/91238/union-metallic-cartridge-co-v-united-states-cartri/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span>, 644; <i>Shepard</i> v. <i>Carrigan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91569\"><a href=\"/opinion/91569/shepard-v-carrigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span>, 597, 598; <i>Roemer</i> v. <i>Peddie,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92605\"><a href=\"/opinion/92605/roemer-v-peddie/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span>, 317.</p>\n<p>Nor does the fact that reissue No. 7947 was applied for only thirteen days after the grant of the original patent establish its validity.

Little, of Buckland, in the county of Franklin and State of Massachusetts, have made certain new and useful improvements in clock-locks, whereof the following is a specification, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a front view of my improved clock-lock attached to the inside of a safe, adjacent to the hinged part of the safe-door. Fig. 2 shows a seventh-day wheel, marked A in Fig. 1. Fig. 3 shows a cam-wheel, marked B in Fig. 1. Fig. 4 shows a graduated cam-wheel, marked C in Fig. 1. Fig. 5 represents the inside of a safe with the door-bolts locked forward by the lever-dog, which is elevated by the clock-lock. Fig. 6 represents a horizontal section of my clock-lock detached from the clocks, the dog-lever excepted, taken through the line <i>x x</i> of Fig. 1. Fig. 7 represents a vertical section of the same, (similarly detached, except that the clock-wheels to which the same is immediately attached are shown,) taken through the line <i>y y</i> of Fig. 1. In the various figures, similar letters indicate similar parts.</p>\n<p>\"D and E are two clock-movements fastened to the inside, F, of a safe, adjacent to the hinged part of a safe-door, G. Said clock-movements, through the wheels and ratchets K and L, (shown by the dotted lines, Fig. 1,) which are rotated once in twelve hours by the clock, propel the wheels H and I in the same time in the direction of the arrows thereon. The wheels H and I are both geared to the common wheel M, having twice as many teeth as either H or I, and propel the same in the direction of the arrow thereon, so that, while H and I are rotated once in twelve hours, M is rotated once a day. It will therefore be seen that both clocks work together in turning the wheel M, and thereby operating the lock, while, if either clock stops, the wheel H or I of the other will alone continue to rotate the wheel M and operate the lock, as the ratchet allows free motion to the wheel I or H of the other clock, although said clock may be stopped. Forming part of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*381</span> wheel M is the toothed wheel N, which is geared into and drives the toothed wheel O. Forming part of the wheel O is the toothed wheel P, which is geared into and drives the seventh-day wheel A. A has twice as many teeth as P, and O has three and a half times as many teeth as N. Therefore, while M revolves once in a day, it propels A to revolve once in seven days. The wheel C, which is graduated for the hours of the day, is fastened upon the hub <i>a</i> of the wheel M by the projection <i>b,</i> and rotates with the same. On the same hub is the wheel B, which is fastened by friction to C in different positions by the thumb-screw Q, which forms part of the wheel B, and passes through the slot <i>c</i> of the wheel C. <i>p p p p p</i> are pivots, on which the several wheels revolve. The wheel B is cut away on the outer edge, leaving the depression <i>d</i> and the cam-projection <i>e</i> thereon; and the edge of C is similarly cut away, leaving the depression <i>f</i> and the cam-projection <i>g</i> thereon. When the two wheels B and C are fastened together by the thumb-screw Q, side by side, they form one wheel, and have a common depression, <i>h,</i> which may be enlarged or diminished by rotating the wheel B on the wheel A with the thumb-screw, and setting the same, and a common cam or projection <i>i,</i> which may be enlarged or diminished in the same manner. Pivoted near the lock is the two-armed lever, R, whereof one arm carries the roller, S, and is lifted through the same by the cam <i>i,</i> revolving under the same at said cam's inclined plane <i>k,</i> and, at the same time, the other arm, T, of said lever lifts the dog-lever, V, as shown by the dotted lines, Fig. 1, up behind the door-bolts W W W W into the position shown in Fig. 5, thereby locking said bolts forward behind the jamb of the safe so the door cannot be opened. Said dog-lever V is pivoted at <i>l.</i> On the other hand, when the cam <i>i</i> is rotated entirely under the roller S, said roller is suffered to drop by gravity into the depression <i>h</i> at the inclined plane <i>m,</i> which allows the dog-lever V to fall from behind the safe-bolts, and the safe to be opened. The seventh-day wheel A has on its edge a cam-projection, <i>n,</i> which rotates once while the depression <i>h</i> rotates seven times, as described, and is so arranged relatively to the said depression <i>h</i> that, on every</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*382</span> </p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*383</span> </p>\n<p>seventh revolution thereof, it is brought under the roller S, and holds up the lever R while the depression <i>h</i> passes under it, so that every seventh day the same prevents the safe from being unlocked.</p>\n<p>\"From the description aforesaid, the mode of operation will be obvious. The clocks are set to true time by bringing the hour-mark on the dial C under the roller S, which is readily done by turning the dial, as the wheels A, B, C, and M are freely turned in the direction of the arrow on C, inasmuch as the ratchets behind H and I do not interfere with motion in that direction, but take up, and, through the clock's force, proceed with, whatever advance of said wheels may be made. The lock is then set to lock up at any given hour, by loosening the thumb-screw Q and turning the inclined plane <i>k</i> of the wheel B to the mark of the required hour, and then fastening the wheels B and C together by setting the thumb-screw Q.</p>\n<p>\"If it is desired to have the lock open any amount of time earlier than the set time, (nine o'clock,) the wheel C must be turned, as described, until the time indicated under the roller shall be that amount fast of true time, the closing-mark being altered, if desired, to suit the case. If it is desired to open later, the clocks must be stopped until they are slow of time as much as it is desired the lock shall open later than the set time, correcting the closing-mark, if desired.</p>\n<p>\"If the wheels A, B, C, and M are turned, as described, until the cam part <i>n</i> of the wheel A shall be in position to come under the roller S, and keep the lock from opening on Sunday, it will continue to do so on Sunday each week if the clocks run on unchanged. In case that it shall be desired</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*384</span>  <span class=\"star-pagination\">*385</span> that the lock shall not open for a holiday or other day, the said wheels may be rotated until said cam part <i>n</i> is in position to come under and hold up the lever R on said day.</p>\n<p>\"The lock is affixed to the side F of the safe, as described, to avoid derangement or stoppage of the clocks by concussion on the door.</p>\n<p>\"It is evident that the dog-lever V and the lever R may be the same piece. The object in making the same in two parts is to save the weight of the part V, which depends upon the pivot <i>l,</i> from adding to the labor of the clocks.</p>\n<p>\"What I claim as my invention, and for which I pray letters-patent, is \u0097</p>\n<p>\"1. The combination, with one or more clock-movements, of one or more wheels, H I, one or more ratchets, K L, and a common wheel, M, arranged as described, for the purposes set forth.</p>\n<p>\"2. The wheels B and C, with the depressions <i>d</i> and <i>f</i> and the projections <i>e</i> and <i>g,</i> located relatively to each other as described, to increase and diminish the surface of a common cam, <i>i,</i> or depression <i>h,</i> by rotation on each other, for the purposes described.</p>\n<p>\"3. The wheel A with a cam, <i>n,</i> adjusted as described, to prevent the falling of the lever R and dog V, either periodically or at required times, as described.\"</p>\n<p>The specification, claims, and drawings of reissue No. 8550 are as follows:</p>\n<p>\"Be it known that I, Samuel A. Little, of Shelburne, in the county of Franklin and State of Massachusetts, have invented certain new and useful improvements in chronometric locks; and I do hereby declare that the following is a full, clear, and exact description thereof, that will enable others skilled in the art to which it appertains to make and use the same, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, and to the letters of reference marked thereon, which form a part of this specification.</p>\n<p>\"The object of my invention is to construct a time-lock which shall dog and release the multiple bolt-work of a safe or vault at certain predetermined times, both the dogging and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*386</span> releasing being caused by the operation of the time mechanism. By this means the time when the lock will dog the bolt-work depends entirely on the adjustment of the internal mechanism of the lock, hereinafter described.</p>\n<p>\"I provide adjustable devices, so that the periods when the lock shall be locked and unlocked may be varied at will; and I also provide a device whereby, at certain intervals \u0097 say on every seventh day \u0097 the lock will remain locked during the time when ordinarily it would be unlocked.</p>\n<p>\"It will thus be seen that I have constructed a lock which will, of itself, dog and release bolt-work at a regular hour each day, except on certain predetermined days \u0097 Sundays, for example \u0097 when it will remain in the locked position all day. My lock, when once adjusted, is therefore absolutely automatic, requiring no attention except winding, and it is, so far as I am aware, the first time-lock which locks at a time determined by the time mechanism, while at the same time the hours for locking and unlocking can be changed without altering the construction of the lock.</p>\n<p>\"To diminish the chances of accident from the stoppage of the time mechanism, I provide two independent movements, both of which assist in rotating the dial to actuate the lock; but, should one stop, the other will continue to rotate the dial.</p>\n<p>\"The particular construction of my lock is, that the two time-movements rotate a graduated dial so arranged that its motion oscillates, at certain regular determinable intervals, a pivoted bent lever, which in turn, in one instance, for automatic locking, lifts the free part of, and thus oscillates on its stationary pivot, a metallic dog or obstruction, so as to cause it to rest in the way, and prevent the retraction of the sliding bolt-work; and in the other instance, for automatic unlocking, it withdraws its support from under and permits the dog to oscillate by gravity, so as to clear the way for the retraction of the bolt-work.</p>\n<p>\"The adjustability of my lock for locking and unlocking I obtain by means of my dial, which is so arranged that what I may call its `bolt or dog-actuating points' can readily be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*387</span> changed from one position to another, so that they will actuate the dogging mechanism at any desired hours for locking or unlocking; and it is to be noted, that in all continuously running dials, the adjustability for unlocking or locking preferably will be obtained in substantially the same way \u0097 <i>i.e.,</i> by varying the position of the dog-actuating points \u0097 because the dial itself should always be running on correct time.</p>\n<p>\"I cause the lock to remain locked on Sundays or other desired days, by means of a supplemental cam, which temporarily assumes one of the functions of my dial, and by which I can at any desired time cause the lock to remain locked during a greater period than twenty-four hours.</p>\n<p>\"Referring now to the drawings in aid of a description of my lock in detail, figure 1 is a front view of my improved time-lock attached to the inside of a safe, adjacent to the hinge part of the safe-door; Fig. 2, a view of the same, partly in elevation and partly in section, on the line 2 2 of Fig. 1; Fig. 3, a horizontal transverse section thereof on the line 3 3 of Fig. 1, with the upper time-movements removed, showing a plan of the locking mechanism proper; Fig. 4, a horizontal transverse section through the centre of the locking dials; Fig. 5, a perspective view of the interior of a safe, showing the door-bolts locked forward by the lever-dog; Fig. 6, a perspective view of the graduated dial (marked C in Fig. 1); Fig. 7, a similar view of wheel B in Fig. 1; Fig. 8, a similar view of a seventh-day wheel (marked A in Fig. 1).</p>\n<p>\"D and E designate two time-movements fastened to the inside, F, of a safe, adjacent to the hinged part of the safe-door G. These time-movements, through the wheels and ratchets K and L, propel the wheels H and I in the direction of the arrows thereon. These wheels H and I rotate once in twelve hours, and are both geared to the common wheel M, which has twice as many teeth as either of them, and they propel it in the direction of the arrow thereon, so that while wheels H and I are rotated once in twelve hours, wheel M is rotated only once a day.</p>\n<p>\"It will be seen that both time-movements work together <span class=\"star-pagination\">*388</span> in turning the wheel M, and thereby operate the lock; but if either accidentally stops, the wheel H or I of the other will alone continue to rotate the wheel M and operate the lock, because each ratchet will allow free motion to either wheel I or H, in the absence of its normal impelling force.</p>\n<p>\"The toothed wheel N, forming part of the wheel M, is geared into and drives the toothed wheel O. The toothed wheel P, forming part of the wheel O, is geared into and drives the seventh-day wheel A, which turns loosely on the hub <i>a</i> of the wheel M. This wheel A has twice as many teeth as wheel P, and wheel O has three and a half times as many teeth as wheel N. Therefore, while wheel M revolves once in a day, it only causes wheel A to revolve once in seven days. The wheel C, which is graduated for the hours of the day, is fastened rigidly upon the hub <i>a</i> by means of the projection <i>b</i> and rotates with it. Loose on the same hub is the wheel B, which may be fastened by friction to the wheel C in different positions by the thumb-screw Q, that is attached to, or forms part of, the wheel B, and passes through the slot <i>c</i> of the wheel C.</p>\n<p>\"<i>p p p p p</i> designate pivots, on which the several wheels revolve. The wheel B is cut away on its periphery, leaving the depression <i>d</i> and the cam projection <i>e,</i> and the periphery of the wheel C is similarly cut away, leaving the depression <i>f</i> and the cam projection <i>g,</i> of the same form and size as the depression and projection of the wheel B. When these two wheels are fastened together by the thumb-screw Q side by side, they form one wheel or dial, having a depression <i>h,</i> which may be enlarged or diminished by rotating the wheel B by means of the thumb-screw, and then setting it, and also having a cam or projection, <i>i,</i> which may be enlarged or diminished in the same manner. Pivoted near its middle to the lock-case is the bent lever R, one arm of which carries the friction-roller S, and is lifted by the cam <i>i,</i> revolving under the roller at the cam's inclined plane <i>k,</i> and at the same time the other arm, T, of said lever lifts the dog V, pivoted at <i>l,</i> up behind the door-bolts W W W W into the position shown in Fig. 5, thereby locking the bolts forward behind the jamb of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*389</span> the safe, so that the door cannot be opened. In due time, when the cam <i>i</i> is rotated entirely from under the roller S, the latter will drop into the depression <i>h</i> at the inclined plane <i>m,</i> which allows the dog V to fall from behind the safe-bolts, when they may be retracted and the safe opened.</p>\n<p>\"It will be noted that the dog always tends to turn on its pivot automatically by gravity, so as to present a free space for the retraction of the bolt-work, and it is held up only for predetermined periods, to be measured by the time mechanism, by the bent lever.</p>\n<p>\"The seventh-day wheel A has on its periphery a cam projection, <i>n,</i> which rotates once while the depression <i>h</i> rotates seven times, as described, and it is so arranged relatively to the depression <i>h,</i> that on every seventh revolution thereof it is brought under the roller S and holds up the lever R, while the depression <i>h</i> passes under it, so that every seventh day this projection <i>n</i> prevents the safe from being unlocked.</p>\n<p>\"From the foregoing description the mode of operation will be obvious.</p>\n<p>\"The time-movements should be set to correct time by bringing the hour-mark on the dial C under the roller S, which is readily done by turning the dial, as the wheels A, B, C, and M turn freely in the direction of the arrow on wheel C, because the ratchets behind wheels H and I do not interfere with motion in that direction, but take up, and, through the force of the time-movements, proceed with, whatever advance of said wheels may be made. The lock should then be set to lock up at any given hour by loosening the thumb-screw Q, and turning the inclined plane <i>k</i> of the wheel B to the mark of the required hour, and then fastening the wheels B and C together by setting the thumb-screw Q. The dial will then indicate the time of locking and unlocking, and the operation of the time-movements will cause the oscillation of the dog into position to obstruct the retraction of the bolt-work in a little time, or at whatever time may have been decided upon, and it will be held there until the time arrives for unlocking, when the continued operation of the time-movements will withdraw its support, and it will fall out of the way.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*390</span> \"If it is desired to have the safe opened any given amount of time earlier than the set time, \u0097 say 9 o'clock, \u0097 the wheel C must be turned, as described, until the time indicated under the roller shall be that amount fast of the correct time, the closing-mark being altered, if desired, to suit the case. If it is desired to open later, the clocks must be stopped until they are slow of the time as much as it is desired the lock shall open later than the set time, correcting the closing-mark, if desired.</p>\n<p>\"If the wheels A, B, C, and M, are turned, as described, until the cam part <i>n</i> of the wheel A shall be in a position to come under the roller S and keep the lock from opening on Sunday, it will continue to do so on Sunday each week, if the time-movements run on unchanged. Thus, the necessity for setting the mechanism on every Saturday, so that it shall keep the safe locked over Sunday, is obviated, which is a great convenience to bankers, and is, furthermore, a security against neglect to set the mechanism weekly, which might sometimes occur. In case it shall be desired that the lock shall not open for a holiday or other day, the said wheels may be rotated until the cam projection <i>n</i> is in position to come under the roller S and hold up the lever R on such day.</p>\n<p>\"The lock is affixed to the side F of the safe, as described, to avoid derangement or stoppage of the time-movements by concussion on the door; but it is obvious that it may be affixed to the door without modifying its construction, if desired, that being merely a change of location.</p>\n<p>\"It is evident that the dog V and the lever R may be one and the same piece. The object of making them in two parts is to save the weight of the part V, which depends upon the pivot <i>l,</i> from adding to the labor of the time movements, and also to make the dog or obstruction entirely distinct from the time mechanism.</p>\n<p>\"I am aware of the patent granted to Williams and Cummings, No. 17,245, and dated May 5, 1857, and do not claim anything shown therein, but intend to limit my claims to comprehend only the improvements I have made over the peculiar combinations shown in that patent, whereby I reduce the number, modify the construction, change the relative <span class=\"star-pagination\">*391</span> position and mode of operation of the parts, and simplify my mechanical organization, as will fully appear by comparison.</p>\n<p>\"What I claim as my invention is \u0097</p>\n<p>\"1.

They take the place of claim 2 of the original patent. They were before Judge Shipman in the cases in 19 Blatchford and 6 Fed. Rep. above referred to, and he held that they covered new inventions and patentable improvements. Judge Lowell, in his opinion in the present case, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*397</span> states that he fully agrees with the views of Judge Shipman as to the novelty and patentability of claims 1 and 7. Although the defendants' lock has but one time-movement to control the lever which controls the dog, Judge Lowell held that that did not affect the question of the infringement of claims 1 and 7.</p>\n<p>In September, 1887, in <i>Yale Lock Mfg. Co.</i> v. <i>New Haven Savings Bank,</i> 32 Fed. Rep. 167, in the Circuit Court for the District of Connecticut, Judge Shipman had before him the question of a rehearing as to the validity of claims 1 and 7, and especially the question whether claim 7 was an enlargement of claim 2 of the original patent. He held that claim 7 \"should be limited to the invention which was described and claimed in the original patent, which invention was not confined to a `common cam,' or to a device which was connected with the compound wheel in the same way in which the cam was connected, but was broad enough to include equivalent means of connection with the dog.\" He held also that the owners of the patent had not abandoned, by proceedings in the Patent Office in respect to the two prior reissues of it, their right to claim, in reissue No. 8550, a double or compound disc, and to obtain a valid patent therefor.</p>\n<p>Claims 1 and 7 were sustained also by Judge Sage, in the Circuit Court for the Western Division of the Southern District of Ohio, in May, 1889, in the case of <i>Yale &amp; Towne Mfg. Co.</i> v. <i>Consolidated Time-Lock Co.,</i> 38 Fed. Rep. 917.</p>\n<p>This patent, as before stated, was reissued May 9, 1876, as No. 7104, and again, January 8, 1878, as No. 8035. The lock used by the defendants is made under letters patent No. 173,121, granted to Henry Gross, February 8, 1876, for an \"improvement in time-attachments for locks.\" This patent was issued prior to the granting of any reissue of the Little patent. While the original patent, No. 146,832, had only three claims, reissue No. 7104 had eight claims, reissue No. 8035 had six claims, and reissue No. 8550 has seventeen claims. On comparing the various reissues with the original patent, it is found that the drawings and the description of them are substantially the same in all, with some changes in nomenclature; and it is quite apparent that the original patent was not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*398</span> inoperative or invalid by reason of a defective or insufficient specification, within the terms of the statute, so as to warrant the reissues.</p>\n<p>There is in the record a copy of the file-wrapper and contents of reissue No. 8035, applied for December 15, 1877, and granted January 8, 1878. The specification presented with the application contained only two claims, both of which made \"a revolving dial\" an essential element. On the 18th of December, 1877, an entirely new specification and claims were put in, the claims being ten in number. Claim 3 was as follows: \"3. In a time-lock, the combination, substantially as above set forth, of the clock-work and two adjustable devices for determining, respectively, the times of locking and unlocking.\" That claim 3 is very similar to claim 7 of reissue No. 8550. On the 21st of December, 1877, that claim 3 was amended by striking out the word \"clock-work,\" and inserting the words \"time-movements,\" so that it became almost exactly the same as claim 7 of reissue No. 8550. On the 26th of December, 1877, that claim 3 was erased.</p>\n<p>Claim 4 of reissue No. 8035, as originally applied for, read as follows: \"The combination with one or more time-movements, of one or more wheels, H I, one or more ratchets, K L, and a common wheel, M, arranged as described, for the purposes set forth.\" This claim 4 was erased with claim 3, and in their place there was inserted the following as claim 3: \"The combination with the time-movements of the wheels H I, the ratchets K L, and the common wheel, M, arranged as described, for the purpose set forth.\"</p>\n<p>Claim 5 of reissue No. 8035, as applied for, was identical with claim 2 of the original patent, No. 146,832, as granted. That claim 5 was rejected by the examiner, on the ground that it was old in valve-gear for steam engines, with a reference to a prior patent; and on the 26th of December, 1877, it was erased and abandoned. Therefore, more than a year before reissue No. 8550 was granted, claim 2 of the original patent was abandoned by Little; and at the same time he also abandoned claim 3 of his application, after he had put it in such shape that it became substantially the same as claim 7 of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*399</span> reissue No. 8550. Reissue No. 8035 was taken out without those claims. No one of the six claims of reissue No. 8035 was infringed by the lock of the defendants, which was applied to use during the existence of reissue No. 8035. A little over nine months after it was granted, the application for reissue No. 8550 was filed; and the present suit was brought eight days after that reissue was granted.</p>\n<p>In the specification of reissue No. 8035, the following statements were made: \"The object of my invention is to construct a time-lock, and to combine it with the multiple sliding bolt-work of a safe or vault-door, so that, by the continuous movement of its time mechanism, locking and unlocking will be effected daily or periodically... . The gist of my invention, therefore, is the combination, in a time-lock, of time mechanism revolving a graduated dial, which serves to oscillate a pivoted bent lever, that, in turn, induces the oscillation of a pivoted dog or obstruction to the retraction of the multiple sliding bolt-work. Subordinate to this main principle or chief organization of my time-lock, I provide that my dial shall be composite in its construction, whereby I obtain what I term a `differential cam' for convenience of adjustment.\" These statements do not appear in the specification of reissue No. 8550. In the latter specification, what had been previously called \"a revolving graduated dial\" is called \"adjustable devices;\" the dial is said to have \"bolt or dog-actuating points;\" and a statement is made that the lock of Little \"is, so far as I am aware, the first time-lock which locks at a time determined by the time mechanism, while at the same time the hours for locking and unlocking can be changed without altering the construction of the lock.\" So that, in this reissue, which was granted almost five years after the date of the original patent, and over three years after the Gross patent was issued, the attempt is made by Little to cover all devices for determining the time of locking and unlocking, on the view that he was the first to invent a lock that would lock up as well as unlock at a predetermined time. This attempt is embodied in claims 1 and 7 of reissue No. 8550, which are here repeated: \"1. The combination of independent multiple <span class=\"star-pagination\">*400</span> bolt-work with the time mechanism and locking or dogging mechanism of a time-lock, automatically both dogging and releasing the bolt-work at predetermined times, substantially as described.\" \"7. In a time-lock, the combination, substantially as above set forth, of the time movements and two adjustable devices, one for determining the time of locking, and the other of unlocking.\"</p>\n<p>Although the first reissue, No. 7104, was applied for March 15, 1876, more than two months after the Gross patent was issued, no such claims as the above were applied for or taken, nor were they taken in reissue No. 8035. Claims 3, 7 and 8 of reissue No. 7104 were abandoned in reissue No. 8035, and severally appear as claims 7, 16 and 17, in reissue No. 8550, claim 7 in No. 8550 being in these words, as claim 3, in No. 7104: \"3. In a chronometric locking mechanism, the combination, substantially as before set forth, of the clock-work and two adjustable devices for determining, respectively, the time of locking and unlocking.\" Claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 and 11 in No. 8550 are entirely new. Claim 2 of the original patent, No. 146,832, was not retained in No. 8550, and only two claims out of the seventeen in No. 8550 are found in the original patent.</p>\n<p>Infringement is alleged of claim 1 of reissue No. 8550, which is an entirely new claim, not found in the original patent or in any prior reissue, and of claim 7, which was claim 3 in reissue No. 7104, and was first amended and then abandoned in the application for reissue No. 8035. If claim 1 of reissue No. 8550 is construed to cover only the specific devices of Little, operating in the mode described by him, and thus is no broader than claim 2 of the original patent, the defendants' lock does not infringe it. If it is not so limited, it is void, under numerous decisions of this court.</p>\n<p>In Little's time-lock, there is a compound cam-wheel or disc, composed of two cam-wheels placed face to face on the same axis, each having a portion of its outer edge cut away, and so arranged that they can be turned with relation to each other so as to increase the length of their common projection or common depression, and be fastened together in any desired <span class=\"star-pagination\">*401</span> position by means of a slot and a thumb-screw in one of them. When adjusted, this compound cam-wheel is revolved by clock-work and made alternately to lift up and let down a lever which in turn lifts up or lets down another lever, the end of which is supported in a position behind one of the bolts of the door, or is allowed to drop away from behind it, thus alternately dogging and releasing the bolt. It is the office of the common projection on the wheels to lift, and then hold up, the levers in the dogging position; and the length of time the bolts will remain dogged depends solely on the length of the common projection.</p>\n<p>In the defendants' lock there is only one time-movement, and there are no wheels of any kind, much less wheels like the cam-wheels B and C of Little's original patent, with projections and depressions, which can be rotated so as to increase and diminish the surface of a common cam or depression; nor has it any cam projection or cam depression of any kind, formed in any manner, whose office is to lift and hold up and let fall a lever, and thus dog and release the bolt of a safe-door; nor has it a device of any kind capable of performing the function of Little's cam-wheels. Little does not describe or suggest, in his original patent, any way by which he can dispense with the use of his cam projections to lift and hold up the dog; and he confines claim 2 of his original patent to a combination in which two cam-wheels, capable of being rotated and adjusted with relation to each other, so as to increase and diminish the surface of a common cam, for the purpose of lifting and holding up the dog, are essential.</p>\n<p>Claim 7 of reissue No. 8550 was evidently drawn so as to cover the time-attachment of the defendants' lock, which does not itself lock up or unlock the bolt-work, but only determines the time when the bolt work may be unlocked by the combination-lock. Claim 7 is not limited to devices which automatically lock and unlock, but extends to devices which merely interfere with mechanical locking and unlocking. Such a construction of claim 7, a claim once abandoned in the Patent Office and restored in this reissue, cannot be admitted in consistency with numerous decisions of this court on the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*402</span> subject of reissues. If, however, claim 7 is so construed as to be no broader than claim 2 of the original patent, then the defendants' lock, as it did not infringe the latter claim, does not infringe claim 7.</p>\n<p>It is shown that it was old to use time mechanism, revolving dials with adjustable devices, pivoted levers and dogs, to lock and unlock door-bolts; and that the combination of clock-work, adjustable cam-wheels, and a two-armed lever oscillated thereby, was old. In this view, in his original patent, Little very properly limited his claims to his mode of connecting two clocks with a common wheel, so that both could act together in turning it, and either one could turn it alone in case the other stopped; and to the employment of the specific cam-wheels with depressions and projections so located as to increase and diminish the surface of a common cam by rotation on each other, so as to lift and hold up the dog behind the bolt of the door; and to the introduction of his Sunday wheel. The lock of the defendants did not infringe any of the claims of the original patent, because it did not have the two clocks, the Sunday wheel, the cam-wheels or any mechanical equivalent therefor, and did not move the dog automatically into the dogging position.</p>\n<p>The application for reissue No. 7104 was made more than two years after the original patent was granted, and one month and seven days after the Gross patent was issued, containing the devices which are employed in the defendants' lock. Reissue No. 8550 was applied for nearly four years and nine months after the original patent was granted, and more than two years and eight months after the Gross patent was issued, and after the lock of the defendants had been put into use. No excuse is shown for these delays; nor is there any defect or insufficiency in the specification of the original patent. In December, 1877, during the pendency of the application for reissue No. 8035, Little acquiesced in the rejection, for want of novelty, of claim 2 of his original patent, and then abandoned a claim corresponding with claim 7 of reissue No. 8550, and took out reissue No. 8035 without such claim.</p>\n<p>The lock of the defendants did not infringe any claim of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*403</span> reissue No. 8035. Claim 1 of reissue No. 8550 is entirely new, and claim 7 of that reissue is the same as claim 3 of the application for reissue No. 8035, which claim was first amended and then abandoned. It was not lawful to introduce claim 7 into reissue No. 8550, after such formal abandonment of it. If either claim 1 or claim 7 of reissue No. 8550 covers a device which would not have been covered by claim 2 of the original patent, or by any of the claims of reissue No. 8035, it is invalid; and even if claims 1 and 7 could properly be restricted to the cam-wheels of the specification or their mechanical equivalents, operating as described, as claim 2 of the original patent was restricted, the lock of the defendants does not infringe either claim 1 or claim 7.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, it must be held that the plaintiffs have no cause of action against the defendants under claims 1 and 7 of reissue No. 8550.</p>\n<p><i>It results that the decree of February 12, 1886, must be affirmed so far as it relates to the Sargent reissue No. 7947, and reversed so far as it relates to the Little reissue No. 8550, and the cause be remanded to the Circuit Court with a direction to dismiss the bill of complaint, with costs to the defendants. As the plaintiffs fail in this court on both appeals, they are to pay the costs of this court on both appeals.</i></p>\n</div>",

Greenleaf, composing the firm of Sargent &amp; Greenleai, against the Berkshire National Bank, a national banking corporation doing business at North Adams, in Massachusetts. The suit was brought for the infringement of two reissued letters patent. One of them is reissue No. 7,947, granted November 13, 1877, to James Sargent, as inventor, for an 'improvement in combined time-lock, combination lock, and bolt-work for safes,' on an application filed October 8, 1877; the original patent, No. 195,539, having been granted to Sargent, September 25, 1877. Only claim 3 of reissue No. 7,947 is alleged to have been infringed. The other reissue is No. 8,550, granted to the Yale Lock Manufacturing Company, January 21, 1879, on an application filed October 14, 1878, for an 'improvement in time-locks;' the original patent, No. 146,832, having been granted to Samuel A. Little, as inventor, January 27, 1874, and having been reissued as No. 7,104, to the Yale Lock Manufacturing Company, May 9, 1876, and again reissued to that company, as No. 8,035, January 8, 1878. Only claims 1 and 7 of reissue No. 8,550 are alleged to have been infringed. After the filing of the bill, and by agreement of the parties, Joseph L. Hall, of Cincinnati, Ohio, was admitted as a defendant. An amended bill was filed, and the bank and Hall answered it. As to both reissues, the answer denied that, before they were granted, the patents were inoperative by reason of a defective or insufficient specification; that any errors arose by inadvertency, accident, and mistake; that any reissues were necessary or are valid; and that the reissues were for the same in ventions as were shown and described in the original patents. It also set up want of novelty and non-infringement. After replication, proofs were taken on both sides, and the case was heard in the circuit court by Judge LOWELL. His opinion is reported in 17 Feb. Rep. 531. He held that claim 3 of the Sargent reissue, No. 7,947, was invalid, and ordered a decree for the plaintiffs as to claims 1 and 7 of the Little reissue, No. 8,550. On the 14th of August, 1883, an interlocutory decree was entered, adjudging reissue No. 8,550 to be valid, as to claims 1 and 7; that the defendants had infringed those claims; and ordering a reference to a master to take an account of profits, and to report damages. In July, 1884, the defendants were allowed to amend their answer by setting up an additional anticipation of the Little patent, proofs were taken thereon, and the case was reheard, before Judge COLT, on the new evidence. He affirmed the former decree, in an opinion reported in 26 Fed. Rep. 104. The master reported $60 damages in favor of the plaintiffs, and both parties excepted to the report. A final decree was entered on the 12th of February, 1886, confirming the report, overruling the exceptions of both parties, and adjudging a recovery in favor of the plaintiffs for $60 damages and certain costs, dismissing the bill as to the Sargent reissue, No. 7,947, and awarding a perpetual injunction as to claims 1 and 7 of the Little reissue, No. 8,550. From this decree both parties have appealed. Joseph L. Hall having died, his executors and trustees have been made parties in his place. The respective specifications and claims of the original Sargent patent, No. 195,539, and of its reissue, No. 7,947, are set forth below in parallel columns, the parts in each which are not found in the other being in italic. The drawings are the same in both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ORIGINAL PATENT NO. 195,539.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Be it known that I, James Sargent, of the city of Rochester,      in the county of Monroe and state of New York, have invented      a certain new and useful improvement in locks; and I do      hereby declare that the following is a full, clear, and exact      description of the construction and operation of the same,      reference being had to the accompanying drawings, in which      figure 1 <i>is an elevation of my improvement applied to</i> a      safe-door. Fig. 2 <i>is a section of the</i> bolt <i>of the</i> time-lock.      Fig. 3 <i>is</i> an inside view of <i>the same</i>. Fig. 4 represents      detached views of the <i>dial</i>, and escape-wheel.

Combination or key locks have <i>only</i>      heretofore been used for <i>this</i> purpose, <i>so far as I am aware</i>.      As such locks are set on combinations, or operated by means      of keys, burglars can force the holders of the combination or      key to unlock the <i>door, and hence</i> such locks are not a      <i>perfect</i> safeguard against robbery. Clock-locks have also      been used upon doors for the purpose of opening the door <i>only</i>      at a determined hour, thus placing it beyond the power of any      person to open the door <i>until that hour arrives;</i> but, <i>so</i> far      as I am aware, such locks have either been used singly on a      door, (<i>in which case</i>, when <i>the</i> lock <i>releases</i> the bolt or      other fastening, the door <i>is</i> unlocked, and <i>may</i> be opened by      any one,) or <i>else</i> a time-movement <i>has</i> been combined <i>directly</i>      with a lock i  such a manner that the two really <i>constitute</i>      but a single lock, <i>in which case</i>, if violence <i>is</i> applied to      <i>the</i> lock, <i>it at once destroys</i> the efficiency of the time      movement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'<i>My invention consists, primarily, in the combination,           with the door-bolt, of a clock-lock and a combination or           key lock applied separately upon the door, having each           an independent action, whereby the clock-lock will not           release its bolt until a certain determined hour, and           when it does release its bolt the combination or           key-lock still remains locked and secures the door</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'My invention further consists in combining a clock-lock with      a combination or key lock, both constructed to be applied on      a safe, vault, or other door, to operate in connection with      the bolt-work of such door, said clock-lock being provided      with a lock-bolt constructed with an opening or offset, which      is automatically brought in and out of coincidence with the      tongue of the door-bolt in such a manner that the door-bolt      may be retained in an unlocked condition for shutting, and      prevented from being withdrawn when locked until both locks      have been unlocked; the prime object being that each lock      shall have an independent action, so that the clock-lock will      not release the bolt until a certain determinate hour, and      when it does release its bolt the combination <i>or key lock still remains locked, and secures the door</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'A <i>represents the</i> combination or key lock, and B the      <i>clock</i>-lock.

Norwich Nat. Bank, and Same v. New Haven Sav. Bank, reported in 19 Blatchf. 123, and 6 Fed. Rep. 377. He held that claim 3 covered a new and patentable invention, and was valid. On the question of the validity of the reissue as to claim a, he said: 'It is next urged that the third claim of the reissue is void, because it was abandoned by the patentee upon the objection of the patent-office, when the original application was pending. In Sargent's original application he made one broad claim. The application was rejected by the examiner, whose decision was reversed by the board of examiners. The examiner then requested that a new application be made, upon the ground that the case presented to the board was not the same case which had been presented to him. A new application was made, containing only the first two claims of the reisspe. Then followed a long and earnestly contested litigation in the patent-office between various interfering applicants, in which, apparently, both patentability and priority were discussed. The Little application contained the broad claim, and the board of examiners said, at one stage of the litigation, whether this question was properly before them or not, that this claim was patentable: so that, when the question came before them upon appeal from the decision of the examiner against h e Sargent reissue, the board say: 'The claim in controversy is the same, in substance, as the first claim of Little, whose application was once in interference with Sargent, and which was admitted to be patentable by the office at the time of the declaration of the interference. The patentability of Little's claim has once been before us in the aforesaid interference, and, after full argument, we concluded that his claim was tenable, and held that some one who was first to combine with the bolt-work, on a vault or safe door, a key-lock and time-lock acting independently of each other, but jointly upon the bolt-work, might have a valid patent therefor.' These facts exclude the third claim from the decision or the <i>dicta</i>, in the case of Leggett v. Avery, 101 U. S. 256. I do not understand that the objection that the reissue is for a different invention from the original was pressed by either of the counsel for the defendant. It is sufficient to say that the claims of the original were for the combination of the third claim, provided with a device whereby the bolt-work may be retained in the unlocked position, for shutting the door, and be automatically locked by the time-lock and mechanically by the key-lock when the bolt-work is cast. The patentee had shown 'means whereby;' but if I have been correct thus far, the gist of his invention consisted, not in that device, but in the triple combination. Other different 'devices whereby' could be introduced by other inventors, which would destroy the value of his patent, if it was unduly limited. As said by the board of examiners, 'means whereby,' while being essential to the convenient use of this combination, is merely incidental to the main idea, and may be varied indefinitely without departing from the spirit and scope of the applicant's invention.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only remark made by Judge LOWELL, in his opinion in the present case, as to the validity of reissue No. 7,947, as respects claim 3, is that the patent 'was reissued so soon after its granting that it is not obnoxious to the objection of undue delay.' The application for the reissue was filed 13 days after the original patent was issued, and the reissue was granted 36 days after the application for it was filed. Judge LOWELL held claim 3 to be invalid, on the ground that, if it was a claim irrespective of any particular means for carrying it out, it was void as a patent for a principle, independently of the state of the art; and that, in view of the state of the art, it was void. He was of opinion that there was no patentable novelty in putting a time-lock, which was old, in place of one of two combination locks, where two combination locks had been before used to dog one combined bolt-work; that it was not patentable to substitute a well-known multiple bolt-work for two such bolt-works, where a time-lock and a combination lock had been before combined in the use of two multiple bolt-works; and that there was no patentable novelty in combining two locks with a single door.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A history of the proceedings in the patent-office in regard to patent No. 195,539 and reissue No. 7,947 shows that claim 3 of that reissue must be held to be invalid. On the 9th of May, 1874, Sargent filed an application for a patent which claimed broadly the combination of a time-lock, an ordinary lock, and a safe-bolt connected with both of them. The claim he made was as follows: 'What I claim is the combination, with a clock or time movement lock and an ordinary lock, attached independently to a safe or vault door, of a safe-bolt constructed so as to rest against or connect with both of said locks, substantially as described, whereby the safe-bolt cannot be withdrawn till both locks have been unlocked.' In the specification he then filed he said: 'This improvement belongs to that class in which two locks are applied upon a safe or vault-door for the purpose of preventing the withdrawal of the safe-bolt till both locks have been unlocked. * * * I employ one ordinary combination or key lock and one tie  movement or clock lock, attached independently to the door, and employ in combination therewith a safe-bolt that bears against or connects with both of said locks in such a manner that, though the ordinary lock may be picked or opened, yet the clock-lock cannot be reached, and the safe-bolt, therefore, cannot be released till the clock has performed its office, and unlocked its lock, at the predetermined hour. * * * But it is by no means essential to this invention that the circular form of lock-bolt should be used, as the ordinary style of sliding-bolt, or other forms of shifting bearings, could be employed, if desired. * * * Clock-locks have before been used both separately and in connection with combination locks. Where used alone, they are insecure, for the reason that burglars, ascertaining the hour upon which the lock is set, may, by confining or disabling the officers of the bank having control of the same, open the safe when the hour arrives. In my improvement such result cannot occur, because the combination lock still locks the safe. Where clock-locks have been combined with ordinary locks heretofore, so far as I am aware, the said locks have been connected by a lever or other connection, so that their actions are dependent on each other. In such case, if the combination or key-lock is injured by a lock-pick, by violence or otherwise, the clock-lock is liable to injury also. By making these independent, as described, I avoid these difficulties.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This application was rejected by the examiner, but, on appeal, his decision was overruled by the examiners in chief, February 17, 1875. The examiner then ascertained that the case had been argued before the examiners in chief on an invention which had not been before the examiner, and that another model was used before the examincrs in chief in place of the one properly in the case. The new feature of invention was a device by which the time-lock could be properly set, and the door then be closed; but that device, which made the invention an operative one, was not shown in the drawing, the specification, or the model, which had been before the examiner. In a communication made to Sargent by the examiner at the time, February 20, 1875, he said: 'As far as the office knows by the record of the case, this new invention may not have been contemporaneous with the first one. The examiner would suggest that a new case be at once filed embodying this invention, which makes the devices operative, and against the patentability of which no question will be raised. The claim, however, must be not broadly for A combined with C, which is not conceded to be entirely inoperative, but A and B combined either with C or some mechanical equivalent thereof, which alone makes A and B operative.' He also said: 'It is suggested to applicant that he file a new case, introducing the new combining device, which allows the door to be shut after the time-lock is set, and thus takes it out from the new reference cited, and the examiner will, in all proper ways, hasten the case forward upon a legitimate claim for A and B with suitable combining device to allow the door to be closed after the time-lock is set, inasmuch as no obstacle exists, as the examiner is at present advised.' In accordance with this suggestion, Sargent, on the 10th of March, 1875, filed a new application, which resulted in the granting of patent No. 195,539. The specification of this application said: 'In locking the safe or vault door, some device is necessary to allow the door-bolt to remain back in the unlocked position until the door is closed, without interfering WITH THE CLOCK-LOCK. [A VARIETY OF devices may be employed for thIs purpose.]' This clause in brackets was afterwards erased. The specification of this application also said: 'In Fig. 1 is shown another device for the same purpose, situated outside the lock, which is the subject-matter of another application. It consists of a socket or bearing, <i>h</i>, attached to the tie-piece, E, of the doo- bolt, and sliding on an independent stud, <i>a'</i>, resting against the lock-bolt. A spring locking-pin, <i>i</i>, is used to connect the parts, when the door-bolt is thrown forward to connect with the jamb. In this case the lock-bolt, D, may be made solid, and may be either of the turning or sliding kind. [Other devices might be used to allow the door to shut. I do not wish to confine myself to any particular form of the device.'] The sentences in brackets were afterwards erased. Sargent thus limited himself to combinations wherein one or the other of the peculiar devices invented by him should be an essential element, which is further evidenced by the fact that in claim 1, as accepted by him, the combination of the clock-lock and combination lock, as applied to the door-bolt, was to be provided with a device whereby the door-bolt might be retained in the unlocked position for shutting the door; and in claim 2 the same combination was to be provided with a lock-bolt having an opening or an offset which was automatically brought in and out of coincidence with the tongue of the door-bolt, whereby the latter might be retained in the unlocked position for shutting the door.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the 16th of March, 1875, the examiner rejected claim 1, saying that it was to be found substantially in the patent granted to Cornell, August 10, 1858, for 'safe bolt-work,' and referring also to three prior patents for time-locks, and adding, that 'merely to substitute either one of the above time-locks for one of the locks shown in Cornell's patent is not regarded as a patentable difference.' To this Sargent's attorney replied, on the 17th of March, 1875: 'The combination is such as to require something else to be done other than to simply substitute for one of the key-locks shown in Cornell's patent one of the time-locks cited by the examiner.' This referred to the devices invented by Sargent, by which his combination was made operative. On the 19th of March, 1875, Sargent's attorney struck out the parts in brackets, before quoted, and also struck out claim 1, and substituted as claim 1 what is claim 2 in the original patent as granted. On March 20, 1875, the attorney reinstated claim 1, and added as claim 2 what is claim 2 in the original patent. On the 22d of March, 1875, the examiner rejected both of the claims on the references before made, and referred also to the English patent to W. Rutherford of April 14, 1831. He added, that 'a rotating lock-bolt having an opening or an offset is not new,' and referred especially to two prior patents, and said: 'The second claim may possibly be allowed if amended by inserting the words 'constructed in two parts and' after 'lock-bolt.\" An appeal was taken from this decision; and on the 27th of March, 1875, the board of examiners in chief reversed the decision of the examiner, doing so on the ground that the combination embracing Sargent's peculiar devices for retaining the door-bolt in an unlocked position, for shutting the door, was new and patentable. Before Sargent's patent could issue, he was put into interference with Stockwell, Burge, and Little, and also with Pillard and Lillie. It is evident from decisions made by the examiner of interferences, and by the commissioner of patents, in questions arising in some of these interferences, that Sargent was regarded as making no claim to a broad combination between the bolt-work of the door, and a time-lock, and an independent non-time lock, which is the subject-matter of claim 3 of reissue No. 7,947. The examiner, the examiners in chief, and the commissioner of patents decided priority of invention in favor of Sargent as to the combination by Sargent of the bolt-work with a time-lock and a non-time lock, and his device for retaining the door-bolt in its retracted position, for shutting the door without interfering with the lock mechanism. The patent No. 195,539 was then issued, on September 25, 1877, with the two claims before set forth, limited by the proceedings which so took place in the patent-office. Th  lock of the defendants did not infringe either of the two claims of the original patent; for it did not contain what is called in claim 1 'a device whereby the door-bolt may be retained in the unlocked position for shutting the door,' after the time-lock is set, nor did it contain what is called in claim 2 'a lock-bolt having an opening or an offset which is automatically brought in and out of coincidence with the tongue of the door-bolt.' This is apparent from the fact that it is not contended that the defendant's clock infringes either claim 1 or claim 2 of reissue No. 7,947, which two claims are substantially identical with claims 1 and 2 of the original patent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the 8th of October, 1877, Sargent filed an application for a reissue of patent No. 195,539. He inserted in his specification what is claim 3 of the reissue as granted. That claim is as broad as the claim made in his application of May 9, 1874, which, as before shown, he abandoned. The examiner rejected this claim twice; and after the second rejection, and on the 26th of October, 1877, Sargent appealed to the examiners in chief. In the statement of appeal his attorney said: 'All time-locks used with bolt-work must have some mechanical arrangement to enable the bolt-work to be retracted for closing the door. Such is present in many old patents, and has never been claimed by my client; but what is claimed by him is for the union of such an old, well-known time-lock with a combination lock and bolt-work all arranged on the same door.' This shows the breadth of the claim as compared with claims 1 and 2 of the original patent. The examiner, in his answer to the reasons of appeal, said: 'Leaving out the descriptive and recitative parts of the claim as well as all superfluous and misleading matter, we have, as the claim, the following elements and arrangements, viz.: A combination or key lock, and a time-lock, combined with the bolt-work of a safe-door, both used independently, and resting against or connecting with the bolt-work. The only elements are the two locks and the bolt-work, no other element being hinted at, even; and the arrangement of said elements is that the locks rest against or connect with bolt-work, and are used independently of each other. To recite in the claim that the 'key-lock is controllable from the outside,' and the 'time-lock upon the inside only,' is entirely unnecessary; for all key or combination locks of safes are controlled only from the outside, and all time-locks, as a matter of course, upon the inside, are automatically unlocked. It is a well-settled principle that a mere explanation of parts or recital of functions neither adds to nor takes away from a claim. All the matter which recites that the door cannot be opened until the lock allows it is a mere superfluity. If, in an ordinary lock patent, we were to add to the claim, 'the arrangement being such that the door cannot be opened until it is unlocked,' it would be simply laughable, as all locks of all sorts serve just this purpose. This vast mass of words in the claim, while, at first glance seeming to restrict the claim, will be found to be entirely misleading; the indisputable scope of the claim being 'the simple, independently acting time and combination or key lock resting against bolt-work of a safe.' That is all; no more, no less. It is to be carefully noted that the claim does not restrict to using the locks upon the door, but only 'in combination with the bolt-work of the door,' and that the claim covers putting on Little or Derby, in the usual way, a Sargent or other combination lock.' After reviewing the various decisions which took place during the pendency of the application of Sargent for his original patent, and showing that the limitation of claims 1 and 2 thereof so as to embrace the peculiar devices of Sargent was what saved them on the question of patentability, the examiner said: 'It very clearly follows that the claim, expanded so as to omit those restrictions, is entirely untenable, in accordance with thev ery terms of the commissioner and board decisions.' The examiners in chief, however, on appeal, reversed the examiner's decision, and the reissue was granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is very clear, from a comparison of the specification of the original patent No. 195,539 with that of reissue No. 7,947, that the specification of the original was not defective or insufficient, and that the patent was not inoperative. Not only is there no evidence in this suit to that effect, but the evidence is to the contrary. The sole object of the reissue was manifestly to obtain claim 3 as an enlarged claim. Not only is claim 3 an enlarged claim, but, assuming that it was new, and for a patentable combination, and that Sargent would have been entitled to make it in his application for his original patent, he was debarred from making it in his reissue. As has been shown, he made such a claim in May, 1874, and abandoned it. The application on which his patent No. 195,539 was granted, was pending in the patent-office from March 12, 1875, to September 25, 1877; and no such claim was made. On the contrary, be struck out from his specification matters evincing an intention to claim something more than the specific devices he had invented; and it is quite evident that the consideration by the patent-office of those specific devices, and the evidence of invention afforded by them, enabled him to procure his original patent with its limited claims 1 and 2. The effect of such an abandonment of a claim upon the validity of a reissue has been often adjudged by this court. Leggett v. Avery, 101 U. S. 256, 259; Mahn v. Harwood, 112 U. S. 354, 359, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174; Union Metallic Cartridge Co. v. United States Cartridge Co., 112 U. S. 624, 644, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 475; Shepard v. Carrigan, 116 U. S. 593, 597, 598, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 493; Roemer v. Peddie, 132 U. S. 313, 317, ante, 98. Nor does the fact that reissue No. 7,947 was applied for only 13 days after the grant of the original patent establish its validity. In Coon v. Wilson, 113 U. S. 268, 277, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 537, enlarged claims in a reissued patent were declared invalid, although the reissue was applied for a little over three months after the original was granted, on the ground that a clear mistake, inadvertently committed, in the wording of a claim, was necessary, without reference to the length of time. See, also, Ives v. Sargent, 119 U. S. 652, 663, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 436; Parker v. Clock Co., 123 U. S. 87, 103, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 38. These views dispose of claim 3 of reissue No. 7,947, independently of the ground on which the circuit court held it to be invalid, and all other considerations urged by the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We come now to consider claims 1 and 7 of reissue No. 8,550 of the Little patent, granted January 21, 1879, on an application filed October 14, 1878. The specification, drawings, and claims of Little's original patent, No. 146,832, were as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Be it known that I, Samuel A. Little, of Buckland, in the county of Franklin and state of Massachusetts, have made certain new and useful improvements in clock-locks, whereof the following is a specification, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a front view of my improved clock-lock attached to the inside of a safe, adjacent to the hinged part of the safe-door. Fig. 2 show a seventh-day wheel, marked 'A' in Fig. 1. Fig. 3 shows a cam-wheel, marked 'B' in Fig. 1. Fig. 4 shows a graduated cam-wheel, marked 'C,' in Fig. 1. Fig. 5 represents the inside of a safe with the door-bolts locked forward by the lever dog, which is elevated by the clock-lock. Fig. 6 represents a horizontal section of my clock-lock detached from the clocks, the dog-lever excepted, taken through the line, <i>x, x</i>, of Fig. 1. Fig. 7 represents a vertical section of the same, (similarly detached, except that the clock-wheels to which the same is immediately attached are shown,) taken through the line, <i>y, y</i>, of Fig. 1. In the various figures, similar letters indicate similarp arts. D and E are two clock movements fastened to the inside, F, of a safe, adjacent to the hinged part of a safe-door, G. Said clock movements, through the wheels and ratchets, K and L, (shown by the dotted lines, Fig. 1,) which are rotated once in twelve hours by the clock, propel the wheels, H and I, in the same time, in the direction of the arrows thereon. The wheels, H and I, are both geared to the common wheel, M, having twice as many teeth as either H or I, and propel the same in the direction of the arrow thereon, so that, while H and I are rotated once in twelve hours, M is rotated once a day. It will, therefore, be seen that both clocks work together in turning the wheel, M, and thereby operating the lock, while, if either clock stops, the wheel, H or I, of the other will alone continue to rotate the wheel, M, and operate the lock, as the ratchet allows free motion to the wheel, I or H, of the other clock, although said clock may be stopped. Forming part of the wheel, M, is the toothed wheel, N, which is geared into and drives the toothed wheel, O. Forming part of the wheel, O, is the toothed wheel, P, which is geared into and drives the seventh-day wheel, A. A has twice as many teeth as P, and O has three and a half times as many teeth as N. Therefore, while M revolves once in a day, it propels A to revolve once in seven days. The wheel, C, which is graduated for the hours of the day, is fastened upon the hub, <i>a</i>, of the wheel, M, by the projection, <i>b</i>, and rotates with the same. On the same hub is the wheel, B, which is fastened by friction to C in different positions by the thumb-screw, Q, which forms part of the wheel, B, and passes through the slot, <i>c</i>, of the wheel, C. <i>p, p, p, p, p</i>, are pivots on which the several wheels revolve. The wheel, B, is cut away on the outer edge, leaving the depressions, <i>d</i>, and the cam projection, <i>e</i>, thereon; and the edge of C is similarly cut away, leaving the depression, <i>f</i>, and the cam projection, <i>g</i>, thereon. When the two wheels, B and C, are fastened together by the thumb-screw, Q, side by side, they form one wheel, and have a common depression, <i>h</i>, which may be enlarged or diminished by rotating the wheel, B, on the wheel, A, with the thumb-screw, and setting the same, and a common cam or projection, <i>i</i>, which may be enlarged or diminished in the same manner. Pivoted near the lock is the two-armed lever, R, whereof one arm carries the roller, S, and is lifted through the same by the cam, <i>i</i>, revolving under the same at said cam's inclined plane, <i>k</i>, and at the same time the other arm, T, of said lever, lifts the dog-lever, V, as shown by the dotted lines, Fig. 1, up behind the door-bolts, W, W, W, W, into the position shown in Fig. 5, thereby locking said bolts forward behind the jamb of the safe so the door cannot be opened. Said doglever, V, is pivoted at <i>1</i>. On the other band, when the cam, <i>i</i>, is rotated entirely under the roller, S, said roller is suffered to drop by gravity into the depression, <i>h</i>, at the inclined plane, <i>m</i>, which allows the dog-lever, V, to fall from behind the safe-bolts, and the safe to be opened. The seventh-day wheel, A, has on its edge a cam projection, <i>n</i>, which rotates once while the depression, <i>h</i>, rotates seven times, as described, and is so arranged relatively to the said depression, <i>h</i>, that, on every seventh revolution thereof, it is brought under the roller, S, and holds up the lever, R, while the depression, <i>h</i>, passes under it, so that every seventh day the same prevents the safe from being unlocked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'From the description aforesaid, the mode of operation will be obvious. The clocks are set to true time by bringing the hour-mark on the dial, C, under the roller, S, which is readily done by turning the dial, as the wheels, A, B, C, and M, are freely turned in the direction of the arrow on C, inasmuch as the ratchets behind H and I do not interfere with motion in that direction, bt  take up, and, through the clock's force, proceed with, whatever advance of said wheels may be made. The lock is then set to lock up at any given hour by loosening the thumb-screw, Q, and turning the inclined plane, <i>k</i>, of the wheel, B, to the mark of the required hour, and then fastening the wheels, B and C, together by setting the thumb-screw, Q. If it is desired to have the lock open any amount of time earlier than the set time, (nine o'clock,) the wheel, C, must be turned as described until the time indicated under the roller shall be that amount fast of true time, the closing mark being altered, if desired, to suit the case. If it is desired to open later, the clocks must be stopped until they are slow of time as much as it is desired the lock shall open later than the set time, correcting the closing mark, if desired. If the wheels, A, B, C, and M, are turned as described until the cam part, <i>n</i>, of the wheel, A, shall be in position to come under the roller, S, and keep the lock from opening on Sunday, it will continue to do so on Sunday each week, if the clocks run on unchanged. In case that it shall be desired  that the lock shall not open for a holiday or other day, the said wheels may be rotated until said cam part, <i>n</i>, is in position to come under and hold up the lever, R, on said day. The lock is affixed to the side, F, of the safe, as described, to avoid derangement or stoppage of the clocks by concussion on the door. It is evident that the dog-lever, V, and the lever, R, may be the same piece. The object in making the same in two parts is to save the weight of the part, V, which depends upon the pivot, <i>1</i>, from adding to the labor of the clocks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'What I claim as my invention, and for which I pray letters patent, is: (1) The combination, with one or more clock movements, of one or more wheels, H, I, one or more ratchets, K, L, and a common wheel, M, arranged as described, for the purposes set forth. (2) The wheels, B and C, with the depressions, <i>d</i> and <i>f</i>, and the projections, <i>e</i> and <i>g</i>, located relatively to each other as described, to increase and diminish the surface of a common cam, <i>i</i>, or depression, <i>h</i>, by rotation on each other, for the purposes described. (3) The wheel A, with a cam, <i>n</i>, adjusted as described, to prevent the falling of the lever, R, and dog, V, either periodically or at required times, as described.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The specifications, claims, and drawings of reissue No. 8,550 are as follows: 'Be it known that I, Samuel A. Little, of Shelburne, in the county of Franklin and state of Massachusetts, have invented certain new and useful improvements in chronometric locks, and I do hereby declare that the following is a full, clear, and exact description thereof, that will enable others skilled in the art to which it appertains to make and use the same, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, and to the letters of reference marked thereon, which form a part of this specification:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The object of my invention is to construct a time-lock which shall dog and release the multiple bolt-work of a safe or vault at certain predetermined times; both the dogging and releasing being caused by the operation of the time mechanism. By this means the time when the lock will dog the bolt-work depends entirely on the adjustment of the internal mechanism of the lock, hereinafter described. I provide adjustable devices, so that the periods when the lock shall be locked and unlocked may be varied at will; and I also provide a device whereby, at certain intervals, say on every seventh day, the lock will remain locked during the time when ordinarily it would be unlocked. It will thus be seen that I have constructed a lock which will of itself dog and release bolt-work at a regular hour each day, except on certain predetermined days,&#8212;Sundays, for example,&#8212;when it will remain in the locked position all day. My lock, when once adjusted, is therefore absolutely automatic, requiring no attention except winding  and it is, so far as I am aware, the first time-lock which locks at a time determined by the time mechanism, while at the same time the hours for locking and unlocking can be changed without altering the construction of the lock. To diminish the chances of accident from the stoppage of the time mechanism, I provide two indepedent movements, both of which assist in rotating the dial to actuate the lock; but, should one stop, the other will continue to rotate the dial. The particular construction of my lock is that the two time movements rotate a graduated dial so arranged that its motion oscillates, at certain regular, determinable intervals, a pivoted bent lever, which in turn, in one instance, for automatic locking, lifts the free part of, and thus oscillates on its stationary pivot a metallic dog or obstruction, so as to cause it to rest in the way, and prevent the retraction, of the sliding bolt-work; and in the other instance, for automatic unlocking, it withdraws its support from under, and permits the dog to oscillate by gravity, so as to clear the way for the retraction of the bolt-work. The adjustability of my lock for locking and unlocking I obtain by means of my dial, which is so arranged that what I may call its 'bolt or dog-actuating points' can readily be changed from one position to another, so that they will actuate the dogging mechanism at any desired hours for locking or unlocking; and it is to be noted that in all continuously running dials the adjustability for unlocking or locking preferably will be obtained in substantially the same way, <i>i. c.</i>, by varying the position of the dog-actuating points, because the dial itself should alway be run on correct time. I cause the lock to remain locked on Sundays or other desired days by means of a supplemental cam which temporarily assumes one of the functions of my dial, and by which I can at any desired time cause the lock to remain locked during a greater period than twenty-four hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Referring now to the drawings in aid of a description of my lock in detail, Fig. 1 is a front view of my improved time-lock attached to the inside of a safe, adjacent to the hinge part of the safe-door; Fig. 2, a view of the same, partly in elevation and partly in section, on the line, 2, 2, of Fig. 1; Fig. 3, a horizontal transverse section thereof, on the line, 3, 3, of Fig. 1, with the upper time movements removed, showing a plan of the locking mechanism proper; Fig. 4, a horizontal transverse section through the center of the locking dials; Fig. 5, a perspective view of the interior of a safe, showing the door-bolts locked forward by the lever-dog; Fig. 6, a perspective view of the graduated dial, marked 'C' in Fig. 1; Fig. 7, a similar view of wheel, B, in Fig. 1; Fig. 8, a similar view of a seventh-day wheel, marked 'A' in Fig. 1. D and E designate two time movements fastened to the inside, F, of a safe, adjacent to the hinged part of the safe-door, G. These time movements, through the wheels and ratchets, K and L, propel the wheels, H and I, in the direction of the arrows thereon. These wheels, H and I, rotate once in twelve hours, and are both geared to the common wheel, M, which has twice as many teeth as either of them; and they propel it in the direction of the arrow thereon, so that, while wheels, H and I, are rotated once in twelve hours, wheel, M, is rotated only once a day. It will be seen that both time movements work together in turning the wheel, M, and thereby operate the lock; but, if either accidentally stops, the wheel, H or I, of the other will alone continue to rotate the wheel, M, and operate the lock, because each ratchet will allow free motion to either wheel, I or H, in the absence of its normal impelling force. The toothed wheel, N, forming part of the wheel, M, is geared into and drives the toothed wheel, O. The toothed wheel, P, forming part of the wheel, O, is geared into and drives the seventh-day wheel, A, which turns loosely on the hub, <i>a</i>, of the wheel, M. This wheel, A, has twice asm any teeth as wheel P; and wheel O has three and a half times as many teeth as wheel N. Therefore, while wheel M revolves once in a day, it only causes wheel A to revolve once in seven days. The wheel, C, which is graduated for the hours of the day, is fastened rigidly upon the hub, <i>a</i>, by means of the projection, <i>b</i>, and rotates with it. Loose on the same hub is the wheel, B, which may be fastened by friction to the wheel, C, in different positions, by the thumbscrew, Q, that is attached to, or forms part of, the wheel, B, and passes through the slot, <i>c</i>, of the wheel, C. <i>p, p, p, p, p</i>, designate pivots on which the several wheels revolve. The wheel, B, is cut away on its periphery, leaving the depression, <i>d</i>, and the cam projection, <i>e;</i> and the periphery of the wheel, C, is similarly cut away, leaving the depression, <i>f</i>, and the cam projection, <i>g</i>, of the same form and size as the depression and projection of the wheel, B. When these two wheels are fastened together by the thumb-screw, Q, side by side, they form one wheel or dial, having a depression, <i>h</i>, which may be enlarged or diminished by rotating the wheel, B, by means of the thumb-screw, and then setting it, and also having a cam or projection, <i>i</i>, which may be enlarged or diminished in the same manner. Pivoted near its middle to the lock-case is the bent lever, R, one arm of which carries the friction roller, S, and is lifted by the cam, <i>i</i>, revolving under the roller at the cam's inclined plane, <i>k;</i> and at the same time the other arm, T, of said lever lifts the dog, V, pivoted at <i>l</i>, up behind the door-bolts, W, W, W, W, into the position shown in Fig. 5, thereby locking the bolts forward behind the jamb of the safe so that the door cannot be opened. In due time, when the cam, <i>i</i>, is rotated entirely from under the roller, S, the latter will drop into the depression, <i>h</i>, at the inclined plane, <i>m</i>, which allows the dog, V, to fall from behind the safe-bolts, when they may be retracted, and the safe opened. It will be noted that the dog always tends to turn on its pivot automatically by gravity, so as to present a free space for the retraction of the bolt-work; and it is held up only for predetermined periods, to be measured by the time mechanism, by the bent lever. The seventh-day wheel, A, has on its periphery a cam projection, <i>n</i>, which rotates once while the depression, <i>h</i>, rotates seven times, as described; and it is so arranged relatively to the depression, <i>h</i>, that, on every seventh revolution hereof, it is brought under the roller, S, and holds up the lever, R, while the depression, <i>h</i>, passes under it, so that every seventh day this projection, <i>n</i>, prevents the safe from being unlocked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'From the foregoing description, the mode of operation will be obvious. The time-movements should be set to correct time by bringing the hour-mark on the dial, C, under the roller, S, which is readily done by turning the dial, as the wheels, A, B, C, and M, turn freely in the direction of the arrow on wheel, C, because the ratchets behind wheels, H and I, do not interfere with motion in that direction, but take up, and, through the force of the time movements, proceed with, whatever advance of said wheels may be made. The lock should then be set to lock up at any given hour by loosening the thumb-screw, Q, and turning the inclined plane, <i>k</i>, of the wheel, B, to the mark of the required hour, and then fastening the wheels, B and C, together by setting the thumb-screw, Q. The dial will then indicate the time of locking and unlocking, and the operation of the time movements will cause the oscillation of the dog into position to obstruct the retraction of the bolt-work in a little time, or at whatever time may have been decided upon; and it will be held there until the time arrives for unlocking, when the continued operation of the time movements will withdraw its support, and it will fall out of the way. If it is desired to have the sae  opened any given amount of time earlier than the set time, say 9 o'clock, the wheel, C, must be turned as described until the time indicated under the roller shall be that amount fast of the correct time, the closing mark being altered, if desired, to suit the case. If it is desired to open later, the clocks must be stopped until they are slow of the time as much as it is desired the lock shall open later than the set time, correcting the closing mark if desired. If the wheels, A, B, C, and M, are turned as described until the cam part, <i>n</i>, of the wheel, A, shall be in a position to come under the roller, S, and keep the lock from opening on Sunday, it will continue to do so on Sunday each week, if the time movements run on unchanged. Thus the necessity for setting the mechanism on every Saturday, so that it shall keep the safe locked over Sunday, is obviated, which is a great convenience to bankers, and is furthermore a security against neglect to set the mechanism weekly, which might sometimes occur. In case it shall be desired that the lock shall not open for a holiday or other day, the said wheels may be rotated until the cam projection, <i>n</i>, is in position to come under the roller, S, and hold up the lever, R, on such day. The lock is affixed to the side, F, of the safe, as described, to avoid derangement or stop-page of the time movements by concussion on the door; but it is obvious that it may be affixed to the door without modifying its construction if desired, that being merely a change of location. It is evident that the dog, V, and the lever, R, may be one and the same piece. The object of making them in two parts is to save the weight of the part, V, which depends upon the pivot, <i>1</i>, from adding to the labor of the time movements, and also to make the dog or obstruction entirely distinct from the time mechanism. I am aware of the patent granted to Williams and Cumming, No. 17,245, and dated May 5, 1857, and do not claim anything shown therein, but intend to limit my claims to comprehend only the improvements I have made over the peculiar combinations shown in that patent, whereby I reduce the number, modify the construction, change the relative position and mode of operation of the parts, and simplify my mechanical organization, as will fully appear by comparison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'What I claim as my invention is: (1) The combination of independent multiple bolt-work with the time mechanism and locking or dogging mechanism of a time-lock, automatically both dogging and releasing the bolt-work at predetermined times, substantially as described.

They take the place of claim 2 of the original patent. They were before Judge SHIPMAN in the cases in 19 Blatchf. and 6 Fed. Rep., above referred to, and he held that they covered new inventions and patentable improvements. Judge LOWELL, in his opinion in the present case states that he fully agrees with the views of Judge SHIPMAN as to the novelty and patentability of claims 1 and 7. Although the defendants' lock has but one time movement to control the lever which controls the dog, Judge LOWELL held that that did not affect the question of the infringement of claims 1 and 7. In September, 1887, in Yale Lock Manuf'g Co. v. New Haven Sav. Bank, 32 Fed. Rep. 167, in the circuit court for the district of Connecticut, Judge SHIPMAN had before him the question of a rehearing as to the validity of claims 1 and 7, and especially the question whether claim 7 was an enlargement of claim 2 of the original patent. He held that claim 7 'should be limited to the invention which was described and claimed in the original patent, which invention was not confined to a 'common cam,' or to a device which was connected with the compound wheel in the same way in which the cam was connected, but was broad enough to include equivalent means of connection with the dog.' He held, also, that the owners of the patent had not abandoned, by proceedings in the patent-office in respect to the two prior reissues of it, their right to claim, in reissue No. 8,550, a double or compound disk, and to obtain a valid patent therefor. Claims 1 and 7 were sustained, also, by Judge SAGE, in the circuit court of the western division of the southern district of Ohio, in May, 1889, in the case of Yale &amp; Towne Manuf'g Co. v. Consolidated Time-Lock Co., 38 Fed. Rep. 917. This patent, as before stated, was reissed May 9, 1876, as No. 7,104, and again, January 8, 1878, as No. 8,035. The lock used by the defendants is made under letters patent No. 173,121, granted to Henry Gross, February 8, 1876, for an 'improvement in time attachments for locks.' This patent was issued prior to the granting of any reissue of the Little patent. While the original patent, No. 146,832, had only 3 claims, reissue No. 7,104 had 8 claims, reissue No. 8,035 had 6 claims, and reissue No. 8,550 has 17 claims. On comparing the various reissues with the original patent, it is found that the drawings and the description of them are substantially the same in all, with some changes in nomenclature; and it is quite apparent that the original patent was not inoperative or invalid by reason of a defective or insufficient specification, within the terms of the statute, so as to warrant the reissues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is in the record a copy of the file-wrapper and contents of reissue No. 8,035, applied for December 15, 1877, and granted January 8, 1878. The specification presented with the application contained only two claims, both of which made 'a revolving dial' an essential element. On the 18th of December, 1877, an entirely new specification and claims were put in, the claims being 10 in number. Claim 3 was as follows: '(3) In a time-lock, the combination, substantially as above set forth, of the clock-work and two adjustable devices for determining, respectively, the times of locking and unlocking.' That claim 3 is very similar to claim 7 of issue No. 8,550. On the 21st of December, 1877, that claim 3 was amended by striking out the word 'clock-work,' and inserting the words 'time movements,' so that it became almost exactly the same as claim 7 of reissue No. 8,550. On the 26th of December, 1877, that claim 3 was erased. Claim 4 of reissue No. 8,035, as originally apple d for, read as follows: 'The combination with one or more time movements of one or more wheels, H, I, one or more ratchets, K, L, and a common wheel, M, arranged as described, for the purposes set forth.' This claim 4 was erased with claim 3, and in their place there was inserted the following as claim 3: 'The combination with the time movements of the wheels, H, I, the ratchets, K, L, and the common wheel, M, arranged as described, for the purpose set forth.' Claim 5 of reissue No. 8,035, as applied for, was identical with claim 2 of the original patent, No. 146,832, as granted. That claim 5 was rejected by the examiner on the ground that it was old in valve-gear for steam-engines, with a reference to a prior patent; and on the 26th of December, 1877, it was erased and abandoned. Therefore, more than a year before reissue No. 8,550 was granted, claim 2 of the original patent was abandoned by Little; and at the same time he also abandoned claim 3 of his application, after he had put it in such shape that it became substantially the same as claim 7 of reissue No. 8,550. Reissue No. 8,035 was taken out without those claims. No one of the six claims of reissue No. 8,035 was infringed by the lock of the defendants, which was applied to use during the existence of reissue No. 8,035. A little over nine months after it was granted, the application for reissue No. 8,550 was filed, and the present suit was brought eight days after that reissue was granted. In the specification of reissue No. 8,035, the following statements were made: 'The object of my invention is to construct a time-lock, and to combine it with the multiple sliding bolt-work of a safe or vault-door, so that, by the continuous movement of its time mechanism, locking and unlocking will be effected daily or periodically. * * * The gist of my invention, therefor, is the combination in a time-lock of time mechanism revolving a graduated dial, which serves to oscillate a pivoted bent lever. That, in turn, induces the oscillation of a pivoted dog or obstruction to the retraction of the multiple sliding bolt-work. Subordinate to this main principle or chief organization of my time-lock, I provide that my dial shall be composite in its construction, whereby I obtain what I term a 'differential cam' for convenience of adjustment.' These statements do not appear in the specification of reissue No. 8,550. In the latter specification, what had been previously called 'a revolving graduated dial' is called 'adjustable devices.' The dial is said to have 'bolt or dog-actuating points;' and a statement is made that the lock of Little 'is, so far as I am aware, the first time-lock which locks at a time determined by the time mechanism, while at the same time the hours for locking and unlocking can be changed without altering the construction of the lock.' So that in this reissue, which was granted almost five years after the date of the original patent, and over three years after the Gross patent was issued, the attempt is made by Little to cover all devices for determining the time of locking and unlocking, on the view that he was the first to invent a lock that would lock up, as well as unlock, at a predetermined time. This attempt is embodied in claims 1 and 7 of reissue No. 8,550, which are here repeated: '(1) The combination of independent multiple bolt-work with the time mechanism and locking or dogging mechanism of a time lock, automatically both dogging and releasing the bolt-work at predetermined times, substantially as described.' '(7) In a time-lock, the combination, substantially as above set forth, of the time movements and two adjustable devices, one for determining the time of locking, and the other of unlocking.' Although the first reissue, No. 7,104, was applied for March 15, 1876, more than two months after the Gross patent was issued, no such claims as the above were applied for or taken; nor were they taken in reissue No. 8,035. Claims 3, 7, and 8 of reissue No. 7,104 were abandoned in reisu e No. 8,035, and severally appear as claims 7, 16, and 17, in reissue No. 8,550; claim 7 in No. 8,550 being in these words, as claim 3, in No. 7, 104: '(3) In a chronometric locking mechanism, the combination, substantially as before set forth, of the clock-work and two adjustable devices for determining, respectively, the times of locking and unlocking.' Claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 11 in No. 8,550 are entirely new. Claim 2 of the original patent, No. 146,832, was not retained in No. 8,550; and only 2 claims out of the 17 in No. 8,550 are found in the original patent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Infringement is alleged of claim 1 of reissue No. 8,550, which is an entirely new claim, not found in the original patent or in any prior reissue, and of claim 7, which was claim 3 in reissue No. 7, 104, and was first amended and then abandoned in the application for reissue No 8,035. If claim 1 of reissue No. 8,550 is construed to cover only the specific devices of Little, operating in the mode described by him, and thus is no broader than claim 2 of the original patent, the defendants' lock does not infringe it. If it is not so limited, it is void, under numerous decisions of this court. In Little's time-lock, there is a compound cam-wheel or disk, composed of two cam-wheels placed face to face on the same axis, each having a portion of its outer edge cut away, and so arranged that they can be turned with relation to each other so as to increase the length of their common projection or common depression, and be fastened together in any desired position by means of a slot and a thumb-screw in one of them. When adjusted, this compound cam-wheel is revolved by clock-work, and made alternately to lift up and let down a lever which in turn lifts up or lets down another lever, the end of which is supported in a position behind one of the bolts of the door, or is allowed to drop away from behind it; thus alternately dogging and releasing the bolt. It is the office of the common projection on the wheels to lift, and then hold up, the levers in the dogging position, and the length of time the bolts will remain dogged depends solely on the length of the common projection. In the defendants' lock there is only one time movement, and there are no wheels of any kind, much less wheels like the cam-wheels, B and C, of Little's original patent, with projections and depressions, which can be rotated so as to increase and diminish the surface of a common cam or depression; nor has it any cam projection or cam depression of any kind, formed in any manner, whose office is to lift and hold up and let fall a lever, and thus dog and release the bolt of a safe-door; nor has it a device of any kind capable of performing the function of Little's cam-wheels. Little does not describe or suggest, in his original patent, any way by which he can dispense with the use of his cam projections to lift and hold up the dog; and he confines claim 2 of his original patent to a combination in which two cam-wheels, capable of being rotated and adjusted with relation to each other, so as to increase and diminish the surface of a common cam, for the purpose of lifting and holding up the dog, are essential. Claim 7 of reissue No. 8,550 was evidently drawn so as to cover the time attachment of the defendants' lock, which does not itself lock up or unlock the bolt-work, but only determines the time when the bolt-work may be unlocked by the combination lock. Claim 7 is not limited to devices which automatically lock and unlock, but extends to devices which merely interfere with mechanical locking and unlocking. Such a construction of claim 7&#8212;a claim once abandoned in the patent-office, and restored in this reissue&#8212;cannot be admitted in consistency with numerous decisions of this court on the subject of reissues. If, however, claim 7 is so construed as to be no broader than claim 2 of the original patent, then the defendants' lock, as it did not infringe the latter claim, does not infringe claim 7. It is shown that it was old to use time-mechanism  revolving dials with adjustable devices, pivoted levers, and dogs, to lock and unlock door-bolts; and that the combination of clock-work, adjustable cam-wheels, and a two-armed lever oscillated thereby, was old. In this view, in his original patent, Little very properly limited his claims to his mode of connecting two clocks with a common wheel, so that both could act together in turning it, and either one could turn it alone in case the other stopped; and to the employment of the specific cam-wheels with depressions and projections so located as to increase and diminish the surface of a common cam by rotation on each other, so as to lift and hold up the dog behind the bolt of the door; and to the introduction of his Sunday wheel. The lock of the defendants did not infringe any of the claims of the original patent, because it did not have the two clocks, the Sunday wheel the cam-wheels, or any mechanical equivalent therefor, and did not move the dog automatically into the dogging position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The application for reissue No. 7,104 was made more than two years after the original patent was granted, and one month and seven days after the Gross patent was issued, containing the devices which are employed in the defendants' lock. Reissue No. 8,550 was applied for nearly four years and nine months after the original patent was granted, and more than two years and eight months after the Gross patent was issued, and after the lock of the defendants had been put into use. No excuse is shown for these delays; nor is there any defect or insufficieny in the specification of the original patent. In December, 1877, during the pendency of the application for reissue No. 8,035, Little acquiesced in the rejection, for want of novelty, of claim 2 of his original patent, and then abandoned a claim corresponding with claim 7 of reissue No. 8550, and took out reissue No. 8,035, without such claim. The lock of the defendants did not infringe any claim of reissue No. 8,035. Claim 1 of reissue No. 8,550 is entirely new, and claim 7 of that reissue is the same as claim 3 of the application for reissue No. 8,035, which claim was first amended and then abandoned. It was not lawful to introduce claim 7 into reissue No. 8,550, after such formal abandonment of it. If either claim 1 or claim 7 of reissue No. 8,550 covers a device which would not have been covered by claim 2 of the original patent, or by any of the claims of reissue No. 8,035, it is invaid; and, even if claims 1 and 7 could properly be restricted to the cam-wheels of the specification or their mechanical equivalents, operating as described, as claim 2 of the original patent was restricted, the lock of the defendants does not infringe either claim 1 or claim 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, it must be held that the plaintiffs have no cause of action against the defendants under claims 1 and 7 of reissue No. 8,550. It results that the decree of February 12, 1886, must be affirmed so far as it relates to the Sargent reissue, No. 7,947, and reversed so far as it relates to the Little reissue, No. 8,550, and the cause be remanded to the circuit court with a direction to dismiss the bill of complaint, with costs to the defendants. As the plaintiffs fail in this court on both appeals, they are to pay the costs of this court on both appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
