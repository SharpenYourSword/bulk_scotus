Various objections to the charge of the court were set out as grounds for the motion for new trial, but it nowhere appears that exceptions were taken to any of these matters, save as involved in the overruling of that motion; nor does the record show that the action of the circuit court was invoked upon the ground that there was no evidence to sustain the verdict. Our right of review is limited to questions of law appearing on the face of the record, and we find none such presented here.
