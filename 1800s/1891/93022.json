By the summons the marshal was commanded 'to summons the Elyton Land Company, a corporation chartered under the laws of the state of Alabama, and who is a citizen of the state of Alabama, to appear * * * to answer the complaint of Margaret Celia McElrath and Linda E.

The complaint was subsequently amended by adding the names of 12 other plaintiffs without any averment as to their citizenship. In the bill of exceptions, which appears in the record, it is stated that 'the plaintiffs were non-residents of the state of Alabama.' As the record does not show that the circuit court had jurisdiction of the suit, which depended upon the citizenship of the parties, the judgment must be reversed at the costs of the plaintiffs in error, and the cause remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings, (Menard v.
