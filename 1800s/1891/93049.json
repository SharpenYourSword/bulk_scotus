Biddle v. Hartranft, 29 Fed. Rep. 90; Lloyd v. McWilliams, 31 Fed. Rep. 261. But it appears to us to have proceeded upon an erroneous view of the statute, as applied to the case before the court. The general scope of the similitude clause in the customs acts is defined in a recent judgment of this court, delivered by Mr. Justice FIELD, as follows: 'To place articles among those designated as enumerated, it is not necessary that they should be specifically mentioned.

Butterfield, 125 U. S. 70, 76, 77, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 714. So the description, 'manuufactures composed wholly of cotton,' or even 'manufactures of cotton,' has been held to be a sufficient enumeration. Stuart v. Maxwell, 16 How. 150; Fisk v. Arthur, 103 U. S. 431. See, also, Hartranft v. Meyer, 135 U. S. 237, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 751. In the customs act of 1883, Schedule A, entitled 'Chemical Products,' besides defining the duties on more than a hundred kinds of such products, makes the duty on 'all chemical compounds and salts, by whatever name known, and not specially enumerated or provided for in this act, twenty-five per centum <i>ad valorem</i>.'

It was argued for the United States that this conclusion would be inconsistent with the decisions in Stuart v. Maxwell, 16 How. 150, and in Arthur v. Fox, 108 U. S. 125, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 371.
