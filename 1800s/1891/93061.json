On the 8th of June following a decree was made, by which, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> among other things, it was ordered and decreed that the bill be dismissed for want of equity as against certain of the defendants named, and that relief be denied to the complainant \"upon all matters and things in controversy\" therein, except as to the amount of money paid by the defendant William C. Goudy for right of way in execution of a certain contract designated; and that for the purpose of ascertaining that amount the case be retained as to the other defendants, and be referred to a master in chancery to take additional testimony on that subject, and to report the amount paid; the court also declaring that on the making of the report such further decree would be rendered as might be equitable. The defendants against whom the case was thus retained were the Chicago and Evanston Railroad Company and its directors, constituting the only parties interested in the amount to be ascertained. From this decree the complainant prayed an appeal, which was allowed, upon the filing of the specified bond with sureties to be approved by the court. No such bond was given, nor was the appeal perfected, nor the record filed in this court at its next subsequent October term. In January, 1889, the appeal was on motion dismissed, this court following in that respect its repeated decisions that it has no jurisdiction of an appeal, unless the transcript of the record is filed here at the next term after the appeal is taken. <i>Hill</i> v. <i>Chicago &amp; Evanston Railroad,</i> 129 U.S. 170, 174.</p>\n<p>The master in chancery took testimony upon the subject of the amount paid by the defendant Goudy, as directed, and in January, 1887, made his report, which, on the 14th of July following, was confirmed; and the court thereupon ordered and decreed that the Chicago and Evanston Railroad Company forthwith pay to the complainant the sum of $6513, with interest, and the costs of the reference and of the suit; and also that all other relief prayed by the complainant be denied as against that company, and that the bill be dismissed against the remaining defendants for want of equity, with costs.

It disposed of every matter of contention between the parties, except as to the amount of one item, and referred the case to a master to ascertain that.

They were no longer parties to the suit for any purpose. The appeal from the subsequent decree did not reinstate them. All the merits of the controversy pending between them and the complainant were disposed of, and could not be again reopened, except on appeal from that decree. As to the other parties, it remained to ascertain the amount of one item and to determine as to its payment. The decree of July 14, 1887, covered that matter, and finally disposed of it.
