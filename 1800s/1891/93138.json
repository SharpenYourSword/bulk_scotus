U. S., 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 949. I may also add to those grounds the fact that, by the laws of the United States applicable to all the territories, it is provided that for each territory there shall be appointed a governor, a secretary, a chief justice, and two associate justices of its supreme court, an attorney, and a marhal , and that their terms shall be four years, and until their successors are appointed and qualified, with this difference: that it is declared with reference to all the officers, except the justices of the supreme court, that they shall hold their offices for that term, unless sooner removed by the president; but that qualification is not added to the term of the justices. Rev. St. &#167;&#167; 1841, 1843, 1864, 1875-1877. It is also to be observed that the acts of congress organizing the different territories of the United States, and providing for judicial tribunals therein, from the foundation of the government down to the present time, with three exceptions, have fixed the term of the judicial officers of the territories at definite period absolutely, without any conditions, or simply with the condition 'upon good behavior.' In two of these exceptions, where the words 'unless sooner removed' are added, the power of removal is not vested in the president, but left to be exercised under the general law of the country applicable to such officers; that is, by impeachment, or by the joint action of the president and congress, after full opportunity is given to the accused of being heard upon the grounds of complaint. In the third exception the words added are, 'unless sooner removed by the president with the consent of the senate of the United States,' which implies a previous consideration by the senate of the grounds of removal, and this would usually be accompanied with notice to the accused, and an opportunity afforded to him of being heard thereon.
