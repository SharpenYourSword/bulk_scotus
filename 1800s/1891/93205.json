Barnes were defendants, a final decree was rendered on the 7th of July, A.D. 1890, in favor of defendants and against the complainant, and that on the 29th of September, 1890, complainant prayed an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, which was allowed.

On July 27, 1891, a bond on appeal was presented to and approved by the circuit judge, who on the same day signed a citation returnable to this court on September 19, 1891. When the term lapsed at which the appeal of September 29, 1890, was returnable, without the filing of the record, that appeal had spent its force, (Evans v. Bank, 134 U. S. 330, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 493,) and appellees caused the case to be docketed and dismissed as above stated. Conceding that the approval of the bond, July 27, 1891, and the signing of the citation, were equivalent to the allowance of a second appeal, returnable to the present term, the transcript of record was not filed on or before the return-day, nor delivered to our clerk until November 18, 1891; and the sole excuse for this delay which appellant presents is that it was supposed that the clerk of the circuit court would transmit the transcript when it was completed.
