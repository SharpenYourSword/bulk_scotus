The master, to whom it was referred to state the account between the parties, reported that there was due to the plaintiff the sum of $20,556.11. The defendant excepted to the master's report in two respects, and appealed from a final decree rendered for the plaintiff in accordance with that report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The defendant failed to pay the taxes assessed on the land from 1869 to 1879, and the land was sold and conveyed for nonpayment of these taxes to Asahel Gage. The plaintiff's president urged the defendant to redeem the land from the tax sales, (as he might, under the Revised Statutes of Illinois, c. 120, &#167; 210, by paying the amounts for which the land was sold, with interest at the rate of 10 per cent., and certain penalties,) and told him that otherwise the plaintiff would be obliged to take steps to protect itself. The defendant promised to pay the taxes and interest, but insisted that the tax deeds were void, for want of previous notice to the tenants of Gage's purchases as required by chapter 120, &#167; 216, of the same statutes. The defendant never paid the taxes, or took any steps towards redeeming the land. After waiting two years, the plaintiff, on August 1, 1881, bought in Gage's tax titles for the sum of $3,750, which exceeded the amount of unpaid taxes and interest by the sum of $300 only, equal to a very small part of the penalties accrued. The master allowed the plaintiff this sum of $3,750, with interest at the rate of 10 per cent., amounting to $1,809.24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant argued that the plaintiff could not be allowed for the taxes, because they had been extinguished by the tax sales and deeds; and could not recover on the tax titles, because they were void, and because equity would not enforce them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the plaintiff did not set up the tax deeds as a ground of suit, but only as evidence of clouds upon his title, arising out of the mortgagor's own neglect to pay the taxes. It is at least doubtful, upon the evidence, whether Gage did not give notice to the tenants of the tax sales; and there is no evidence whatever of any invalidity in the taxes, the sales, or the deeds, in any other respect. In this state of things, the mortgagee was not bound to take the risk of contesting the tax titles, and the sums paid to extinguish those titles were reasonable expenses chargeable to the mortgagor by the terms of the mortgage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The defendant, who is an attorney at law, claimed by way of set-off the sum of $2,500 for professional services, and the further sum of $5,000 for a general retainer, by reason of the president having, as the defendant testified, said that he 'wished to engage him professionally in behalf of the company with reference to fifteen or twenty cases,&#8212;litigated or complicated cases,&#8212;growing out of their foreclosure proceedings and claims upon property.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The master allowed the defendant the sum of $600 for professional services actually rendered, and the evidence does not satisfy us that they were worth more.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant's claim for a retainer for services in suits to be brought in the future was rightly disallowed by the master.
