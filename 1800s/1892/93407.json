Hedden, late collector of the port of New York, to recover duties paid. Judgment for defendant. 37 Fed. Rep. 99. Plaintiff brings error. Affirmed.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">STATEMENT BY MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was an action brought in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York to recover duties alleged to have been paid under protest upon three importations of tiles by the steamships Canada, Furnessia, and Rhaetia, entered at the port of New York in 1886. The case was tried by the circuit court (LACOMBE, J.) and a jury in October, 1888.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the bill of exceptions it appears that the plaintiff introduced testimony showing the importation of the tiles described in the bill of particulars, and that the defendant, as collector of customs, levied and collected duty at 55 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> thereon; and that the plaintiff in due season protested, and appealed to the secretary of the treasury, and brought suit within the time prescribed by law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ground of the objection stated in the protests was, as to the Furnessia, that the tiles 'were dutiable at 35 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>, under section 2499, Rev. St., by similitude to encaustic tiles;' and as to the Canada and Rhaetia, that the tiles 'were dutiable at 20 per cent <i>ad valorem</i>, under Tariff Schedule B, as paving tile, directly or by virtue of section 2499, Rev. St. If not so dutiable, then they should pay 35 per cent., by similitude to encaustic tiles, under said section and schedule.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testimony was given showing 'that upon the entry ex Canada, February 24, 1886, a portion of the duty was paid on the 26th day of February, 1886, and the remainder on the 10th day of May, 1886. The only goods in this suit upon said entry were two packages of tiles, marked 'D. F. &amp; T., 25,306, 25,307,' on which duty was taken on entry at 35 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>, the same being entered as 'encaustic titles.' Both of said packages were delivered to the plaintiff on or before March 18, 1886. Duties on said entry to the amount of $126.10 were paid February 26, 1886, (the date of said entry;) and an increased duty of $14.30, (total,$140.40,) was paid May 10, 1886. The bill of particulars claimed, as an excess of duty on this entry, $12.20. * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Testimony was further given that all the tiles in dispute were called in trade 'plain glazed and plain enameled tiles.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Those having the color in the glaze are termed 'enameled,' and those having the color in the body are termed 'plain glazed.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The goods were described in the plaintiff's entries as follows: (1) By the Canada, February 26, 1886, two packages encaustic tiles. (2) By the Furnessia, May 25, 1886, eight casks plain white tiles. (3) By the Rhaetia, June 4, 1886, eight hogsheads, one case, earthenware tiles. The invoice by the Furnessia described the goods as 'glazed earthenware tiles.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Witnesses, after testifying to the use of tiles on March 3, 1883, and prior thereto, were asked as to their use since, and for what purposes they were used or intended to be used now, or for what purposes imported; but the court sustained objections to the questions, and plaintiff excepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testimony was adduced on plaintiff's behalf 'by dealers in tiles of long experience, that on March 3, 1883, and immediately prior thereto, the tiles in suit were used in this country to lay down in cement in vestibules, on hearths, bathroom floors and walls, on kitchen floors, under sinks, interspersed with unglazed tiles on floors in church chancels, conservatories, hospital floors and walls, and generally in places where either a nonabsorbent cleanly tile was required, or where there was little wear and tear, and a particularly ornamental effect was desired;' and also 'by importers and large dealers in tiles of many years' experience that at the date of the passage of the act of March 3, 1883, the term, 'paving tile' had no meaning in the trade and commerce of this country different from its ordinary meaning, and meant tiles used for paving, and gave evidence tending to show that plaintiff's importations per Canada and Rhaetia were such tiles;' and also 'by architects of long experience in this country that plaintiff's tiles were used for paving purposes; that tiles used for hearths were considered paving tiles; that the hearth, architecturally, was a part and an extension of the floor, and that a paving tile was a tile made to be laid horizontally and flat, and intended so to be used.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'It appeared, however, that the principal use of the tile imported per Furnessia, represented at the trial by sample Exhibit No. 5, was for walls, though sometimes used for hearths, bathroom floors, and under kitchen sinks and other places, at the date of the passage of the act of March 3, 1883.

The entry described the articles as 'eight hogsheads, one case, earthenware tiles,' and the collector assessed them as earthenware composed of earthy substances. The court held that the similitude clause did not apply, and the jury found against the plaintiff upon the only issue submitted to them, namely, whether the articles were paving tiles or earthenware. It was not contended that these tiles were encaustic tiles, composed of several kinds of clay instead of one only; and, as to their identity with paving tiles, defendant's evidence tended to show that at the time of the passage of the act paving tiles were commercially known as 'unglazed, hardbaked tiles,' and that the tiles in suit were of a different kind of clay, composed of softer, more porous, and more expensive clays, and costing 10 times as much as paving tile clay. We must assume that the tiles were neither encaustic nor paving tiles, and, if they properly fell within the fourth paragraph, they cannot be held to be nonenumerated articles, and taxed by similitude. Arthur v. Butterfield, 125 U. S. 70, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 714; Mason v. Robertson, 139 U. S. 624, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 668.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The covering of roofs, floors, and walls with tiles made of many different materials is of very ancient origin, and there is much interesting information in respect of their manufacture and that of pottery to be found in works on those subjects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So far as this case is concerned, we see no reason to question the sufficiency of the ordinary definition of 'tiles' as 'plates or pieces of baked clay, used for covering roofs, floors, and walls, and for ornamental work of various kinds, as well as for drains,' etc. And that such pieces, being made of earth, are earthen, and, being earthen goods, commodities, or merchandise, are 'earthenware,' we think is clear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webster defines 'earthenware' as 'vessels, and other utensils, ornaments, or the like, made of baked clay;' and we agree with counsel for defendant in error that the words 'or the like,' and the cross reference to 'pottery,' are broad enough to include the tiles in suit under the fourth paragraph.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The title to Schedule B divides the subjects under it into two classes,&#8212;'earthenware' and 'glassware;' but counsel insists that the groups are three: '(1) Earthenware; (2) tiles, brick, and slate; (3) glass and glass articles.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reference is made to the tariff legislation since 1842 to show that tiles and earthernware were considered different things, and that tiles were always associated with bricks as similar things. It is argued that this distinction was intended to be preserved in the act under consideration; but we are of opinion that this conclusion does not follow, and that it was the intention of congress to place all of the articles in Schedule B in one or the other of the two classes designated in the heading. All of the schedule relates to glass, except the first nine paragraphs. The first five, it is conceded, relate solely to earthenware, and the next four are encaustic tiles; brick, fire brick, and roofing and paving tiles; slates, slate pencils, etc.; and roofing slates; all consisting of earths, though only two hardened by man. These four are all in some respects in similitude, and although a difference between a Sevres vase and a roofing slate may be admitted, they are not inappropriately placed where they are, and we perceive no adequate ground for holding that they should be treated as a class by themselves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact seems to be that these tiles were decorative earthenware tiles, called in trade, as appears from the evidence, 'plain glazed' and 'plain enameled' tiles, those having the color in the glaze being termed 'enameled,' and those having the color in the body being termed 'plain glazed;' and in reference to such tiles the department ruling is that they are properly assessed as 'glazed earthernware.' Syn. Dec. 1885, 7051; and see Id. 1877, 3352; Id. 1878, 3705.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the view taken by the court entirely correct, and this disposes also of the importation by the Furnessia. The protest rested upon the sole ground that the articles 'were dutiable at 35 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>, under section 2499, Rev. St., by similitude to encaustic tiles.' The articles were described in plaintiff's entry as 'eight casks plain white tiles,' and the invoice as 'glazed earthenware tiles.' The collector taxed them under the fourth paragraph.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appeared that the principal use of these tiles was for walls, though sometimes used for hearths, bathroom floors, and under sinks, and for the same general purposes as glazed encaustic tiles; but, if they were covered by the fourth paragraph, then they could not be classed with encaustic tiles by similitude. And that these 'plain white tiles,' or 'glazed earthenware tiles,' were within that paragraph, follows from what we have already said. There was nothing to be submitted to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tiles brought by the Canada were described in plaintiff's entry as 'two packages encaustic tiles,' and were delivered to plaintiff on or before March 18, 1886. It was shown that a portion of the duty was paid on the day of entry, February 26th, and the remainder May 10th. As plaintiff had been in possession of these tiles for some weeks before payment of the excess, he did not pay in order to obtain possession, and the instruction of the court to find for the defendant was therefore correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's counsel insists that he originally paid the difference between paving tiles and encaustic tiles to obtain possession, but, as the tiles were described as 'encaustic,' and chargeable by law as such at a duty of 35 per cent., this contention is inadmissible. There is nothing to show that the circuit court was apprised that plaintiff's claim was that he had paid the excess between 20 and 35 per cent.; and, as payment of the excess between 35 and 55 per cent. was made May 10th, and the protest filed and appeal taken to the secretary of the treasury on that day, it is plain that the circuit court was not mistaken as to the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we are of opinion that the court did not err in excluding evidence as to the purposes for which similar tiles were used after March 3, 1883, or for what purposes they were intended to be used or were imported at the time of the trial. This came within the rule that the classification is to be determined as of the date when the law imposing the duty was passed. Curtis v. Martin, 3 How. 106, 109; Twine Co. v. Worthington, 141 U.
