There shall be levied, collected, and paid on the importation of all raw or unmanufactured articles, not herein enumerated or provided for, a duty of ten per centum ad valorem; and all articles manufactured, in whole or in part, not herein enumerated or provided for, a duty of twenty per centum ad valorem.' 22 St. p. 523.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 23 of the act of March 2, 1861, (12 St. p. 195,) the free list, contains this item: 'India rubber, in bottles, slabs, or sheets, unmanufactured.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The paragraph of Schedule N of section 2502 of the act of March 3, 1883, under which the collector proceeded, is one of three, reading as follows:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'India rubber fabrics, composed wholly or in part of India rubber, not specially enumerated or provided for in this act, thirty per centum ad valorem.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Articles composed of India rubber, not specially enumerated or provided for in this act, twenty-five per centum ad valorem.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'India rubber boots and shoes, twenty-five per centum ad valorem.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the free list (section 2503) is to be found:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'India rubber, crude, and milk of.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the trial various exhibits of crude rubber, washed rubber, dental rubber, and dental plates were put in evidence, and the proofs established that these importations were dental rubber, which was commercially so known, and fit for dental purposes only.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It further appeared that dental rubber was crude rubber put through a masticator, by which it was torn up and shredded into a state of pulp, sulphur and coloring matter added, and the mass rolled into sheets, cut into proper sizes, and backed with linen, to prevent the pieces from sticking together; that the heat of the mill, or masticator, was not a vulcanizing heat, but sufficient to render the rubber elastic. The circuit court, (Lacombe J.,) refused to direct the jury to find for the plaintiff, but, on the contrary, directed a verdict for the defendant. There were a verdict and judgment accordingly, and plaintiff sued out this writ of error. The opinion of Judge Lacombe will be found in 37 Fed. Rep. 197.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Edwin B.
