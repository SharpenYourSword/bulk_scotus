The point there decided was that the report of the surveyor general, not acted on by Congress, was no evidence to support ejectment upon a grant from the Mexican government, known as the Nolan grant; and Mr. Justice Bradley, in delivering judgment, said: \"The surveyor general's report is no evidence of title or right to possession. His duties were prescribed by the act of July 22, 1854, before referred to, and consisted merely in making inquiries and reporting to Congress for its action. If Congress confirmed a title reported favorably by him, it became a valid title; if not, not.\" And he guardedly added: \"This case seems to have been very perfunctorily tried and discussed. There is a question which may be entitled to much consideration, whether the Nolan title has any validity at all without confirmation by Congress. The act of July 22, 1854, before referred to, seems to imply that this was necessary.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></span>, 352, 355.</p>\n<p>The case is one of those, jurisdiction of which has been committed to a particular tribunal, and which cannot, therefore, at least while proceedings are pending before that tribunal, be taken up and decided by any other. <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>Towsley,</i> 13 Wall. 72; <i>Smelting Co.</i> v. <i>Kemp,</i> 104 U.S. 636; <i>Steel</i> v. <i>Smelting Co.,</i> 106 U.S. 447; <i>New Orleans</i> v. <i>Paine,</i> 147 U.S. 261.</p>\n<p>In this case, Congress has constituted itself the tribunal to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> finally determine, upon the report and recommendation of the surveyor general, whether the claim is valid or invalid. The petition to the surveyor general is the commencement of proceedings, which necessarily involve the validity of the grant from the Mexican government under which the petitioners claim title; the proceedings are pending until Congress has acted; and while they are pending, the question of the title of the petitioners cannot be contested in the ordinary courts of justice.</p>\n<p>Upon this short ground, without considering any other question, the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Territory of Arizona is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>MR.
