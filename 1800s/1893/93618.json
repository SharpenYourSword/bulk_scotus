JUSTICE GRAY, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>The decision of this case turns upon the construction of the contract of February 4, 1884, by which the parties agreed to buy certain lands and to sell them again for the joint benefit of both.</p>\n<p>The provisions of that contract were, in substance, that those lands, in the greater part of which Shaeffer already had an equitable title under agreements of third persons to sell and convey them to him, should be purchased, for the mutual interest of the parties; that the legal title in all the lands should be taken in Shaeffer's name, and be conveyed by him to Blair; that Blair should advance the sums required to enable Shaeffer to pay the purchase money of the lands, as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*256</span> well as the necessary expenses of preparing them for sale and selling them, and should be repaid his advances, with interest, out of the net proceeds of sales; that Shaeffer should stake out the lands for sale, make the necessary improvements, sell them, retain a commission of five per cent upon the gross amount of sales, and, until Blair should have been reimbursed for his advances, deposit the rest of the proceeds in a bank to Blair's credit; that the expenses of improving and selling the lands, the time within which they must be prepared for sale, the price at which they might be sold, and the bank in which the proceeds should be deposited by Shaeffer, should be mutually agreed upon between him and Blair, and all contracts of sale by Shaeffer should be approved by Blair; and that, when Blair should have been reimbursed for all his advances, \"then the remainder of the property shall belong, sixty per cent to said Blair and forty per cent to said Shaeffer,\" and be divided between them accordingly, either by Blair's conveying the title in two fifths of the lands to Shaeffer, or by Shaeffer's selling the lands and paying sixty per cent of the proceeds to Blair.</p>\n<p>The contract evidently contemplated that, while the sales to be made by Shaeffer should be subject to Blair's approval, no sales should be made by Blair without Shaeffer's consent. This clearly appears from several provisions of the contract. It is by Shaeffer, or, as said in the last clause of the contract, \"by said Shaeffer or assigns,\" that the lands are to be staked out into lots and prepared for sale. \"Said Shaeffer is to deduct and receive five per cent commission upon gross sales of all lots sold at the agreed price or over, made by said Blair and Shaeffer,\" that is to say, \"of all lots sold\" by Shaeffer \"at the agreed price or over,\" the price (not the sales) being \"made by said Blair and Shaeffer.\" The provision that all contracts of sale shall be made in triplicate, and approved in writing by Blair, and one copy retained by Shaeffer, clearly implies that all contracts of sale shall be initiated by Shaeffer. And after Blair shall have been reimbursed his advances, then, if the lands are not themselves divided between them, it is Shaeffer who is to sell them and divide the proceeds.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*257</span> In short, Shaeffer was to contribute to the venture his equitable title in the greater part of the lands to be purchased, as well as his own services; Blair was to contribute all the money required to carry out the enterprise; the legal title was to be taken in Shaeffer's name, and conveyed by him to Blair; Shaeffer was to attend to preparing the lands for sale, and to sell them, subject to Blair's approval; Shaeffer was to receive a commission of five per cent on the gross amount of sales; out of the rest of the proceeds, Blair was to be repaid his advances; and after Blair had been reimbursed, the property was to belong, three fifths to Blair and two fifths to Shaeffer, and to be divided between them accordingly, either in lands or in money.</p>\n<p>Taking into consideration the whole scope of the contract, and the fact that, before it was made, Shaeffer had an equitable interest in the greater part of the lands, which was in fact, and was evidently considered by both parties to be, of greater value than the price which he had agreed to pay for them; that the title to all the lands was to be taken in Shaeffer's name in the first instance, and to be conveyed by him to Blair; and especially the express stipulation that, after Blair should have been fully reimbursed for his advances, out of the proceeds of sales, \"then the remainder of the property shall belong, sixty per cent to said Blair and forty per cent to said Shaeffer,\" and should be divided between them accordingly; the conclusion appears to us to be inevitable, that the conveyance of the legal title by Shaeffer to Blair, like the deposit of proceeds of sales made by Shaeffer to Blair's credit, was intended as security only for Blair's advances; that Shaeffer was to have and retain an equitable title in two fifths of the land, subject to the claim of Blair for reimbursement; and that Shaeffer's fraudulent misconduct, while it might properly defeat any claim of his for commissions, did not divest him of his equitable title in the lands, as recognized and stipulated for in the contract.</p>\n<p>There may doubtless be a partnership in the purchase and the resale of lands, as of any other property.

Blair against Samuel C. Shaeffer for specific performance of a contract. There was a decree for plaintiff in the court below, (33 Fed. Rep. 218,) and defendant appeals. Reversed.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Statement by Mr. Justice GRAY:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was a bill in equity, filed December 8, 1885, by John I. Blair, a citizen of New Jersey, against Samuel C. Shaeffer, a citizen of Ohio, and other persons, citizens of other states, claiming under him, setting forth a contract in writing between the plaintiff and Shaeffer, dated February 4, 1884, (which is copied in the margin,)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and praying that Shaeffer might be ordered to convey to the plaintiff the lands described in that contract, and that it be adjudged that the defendants had no title or interest therein, and for further relief.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing in the circuit court, upon pleadings and proofs, the case appeared to be in substance as follows: In February, 1884, Shaeffer obtained and received from the plaintiff sums of money amounting to $92,882.70, upon fraudulent representations that they were needed to pay for the lands described in the contract; and, within a month after its date, procured conveyances of those lands to himself, by paying therefor sums amounting to $59,789.30 only, and paid $500 for taxes and other necessary expenses, leaving the sum of $32,593.40 due to the plaintiff; and afterwards refused, on demand, to convey the lands to the plaintiff.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The three tracts of land described in the contract contained respectively about 36 1/2 acres, about 138 acres, and 69 acres, near Kansas City, in the state of Missouri, and were worth more at the time of the contract than the sums paid by the plaintiff, and greatly increased in value afterwards.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an action at law against Shaeffer, submitted to the circuit court without a jury at the same time with the present suit in equity, the plaintiff recovered judgment for the aforesaid sum of $32,593.40. Upon that judgment no writ of error was sued out.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present suit the circuit court held that the contract sued on created no partnership between the plaintiff and Shaeffer, and conferred on Shaeffer only the right of an agent to sell, with a share in the profits by way of compensation; and that Shaeffer, by his fraudulent conduct, had forfeited all his rights under the contract, including not only the 5 per cent. commission on sales, but the share of 40 per cent. in the net profits remaining after payment of the sums advanced by the plaintiff; and entered a decree for the plaintiff as prayed for. 33 Fed. Rep. 218. From this decree Shaeffer appealed to this court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Richard A. Harrison and C. D. Martin, for appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chas. O. Tichenor, for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Argument of Counsel from pages 252-255 intentionally omitted]</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice GRAY, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of this case turns upon the construction of the contract of February 4, 1884, by which the parties agreed to buy certain lands, and to sell them again for the joint benefit of both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provisions of that contract were, in substance, that those lands, in the greater part of which Shaeffer already had an equitable title under agreements of third persons to sell and convey them to him, should be purchased for the mutual interest of the parties; that the legal title in all the lands should be taken in Shaeffer's name, and be conveyed by him to Blair; that Blair should advance the sums required to enable Shaeffer to pay the purchase money of the lands, as well as the necessary expenses of preparing them for sale and selling them, and should be repaid his advances, with interest, out of the net proceeds of sales; that Shaeffer should stake out the lands for sale, make the necessary improvements, sell them, retain a commission of 5 per cent. upon the gross amount of sales, and, until Blair should should have been reimbursed for his advances, deposit the rest of the proceeds in a bank to Blair's credit; that the expenses of improving and selling the lands, the time within which they must be prepared for sale, the price at which they might be sold, and the bank in which the proceeds should deposited by Shaeffer, should be mutually agreed upon between him and Blair, and all contracts of sale by Shaeffer should be approved by Blair; and that, when Blair should have been reimbursed for all his advances, 'then the remainder of the property shall belong 60 per cent. to said Blair and 40 per cent. to said Shaeffer,' and be divided between them accordingly, either by Blair's conveying the title in two fifths of the lands to Shaeffer, or by Shaeffer's selling the lands and paying 60 per cent. of the proceeds to Blair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contract evidently contemplated that, while the sales to be made by Shaeffer should be subject to Blair's approval, no sales should be made by Blair without Shaeffer's consent. This clearly appears from several provisions of the contract. It is by Shaeffer, or, as said in the last clause of the contract, 'by said Shaeffer or assigns,' that the lands are to be staked out into lots and prepared for sale. 'Said Shaeffer is to deduct and receive five per cent. commission upon gross sales of all lots sold at the agreed price of over made by said Blair and Shaeffer;' that is to say, 'of all lots sold' by Shaeffer 'at the agreed price or over,' the price (not the sales) being 'made by said Blair and Shaeffer.' The provision that all contracts of sale shall be made in triplicate, and approved in writing by Blair, and one copy retained by Shaeffer, clearly implies that all contracts of sale shall be initiated by Shaeffer; and after Blair shall have been reimbursed his advances, then, if the lands are not themselves divided between them, it is Shaeffer who is to sell them and divide the proceeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, Shaeffer was to contribute to the venture his equitable title in the greater part of the lands to be purchased, as well as his own services. Blair was to contribute all the money required to carry out the enterprise. The legal title was to be taken in Shaeffer's name, and conveyed by him to Blair. Shaeffer was to sttend to preparing the lands for sale, and to sell them, subject to Blair's approval. Shaeffer was to receive a commission of 5 per cent. on the gross amount of sales. Out of the rest of the proceeds Blair was to be repaid his advances, and, after Blair had been reimbursed, the property was to belong three fifths to Blair and two fifths to Shaeffer, and to be divided between them accordingly, either in lands or in money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking into consideration the whole scope of the contract, and the fact that before it was made Shaeffer had an equitable interest in the greater part of the lands, which was in fact, and was evidenly considered by both parties to be, of greater value than the price which he had agreed to pay for them; that the title to all the lands was to be taken in Shaeffer's name in the first instance, and to be conveyed by him to Blair; and especially the express stipulation that, after Blair should have been fully reimbursed for his advances out of the proceeds of sales, 'then the remainder of the property shall belong sixty per cent. to said Blair and forty per cent. to said Shaeffer,' and should be divided between them accordingly,&#8212;the conclusion appears to us to be inevitable that the conveyance of the legal title by Shaeffer to Blair, like the deposit of proceeds of sales made by Shaeffer to Blair's credit, was intended as security only for Blair's advances; that Shaeffer was to have and retain an equitable title in two fifths of the land, subject to the claim of Blair for reimbursement; and that Shaeffer's fraudulent misconduct, while it might properly defeat any claim of his for commissions, did not divest him of his equitable title in the lands, as recognized and stipulated for in the coutract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There may doubtless be a partnership in the purchase and the resale of lands, as of any other property. But this contract contains no expression to indicate an intention of the parties to become partners. It dose not authorize either party, without the consent of the other, to sell any property or to contract any debts on behalf of both. If the enterprise proves nusuccessful, the contract does not provide or contemplate that Shaeffer shall share the loss; and the phrase, 'said Shaeffer or assigns,' in the last clause, (unless supposed to be inadvertently inserted,) is hardly consistent with the idea of a partnership. There is great difficulty, therefore, in the way of construing this contract as creating a partnership botween Blair and Shaeffer. Thompson v. Bowman, 6 Wall. 316; Seymour v. Freer, 8 Wall. 202; Meehan v. Valentine, 145 U. S. 611, 623, 12 Sup. Ct.

Roane, 99 U. S. 355; Wadsworth v. Adams, 138 U. S. 380, 11 Sup. Ct.

Blair, of Blairstown, New Jersey, has paid for the same by giving to said Shaeffer a check on the National Park Bank of New York city for the sum of $21,882, signed by the president of the Belvidere National Bank of New Jersey, to enable him to pay for the said land.</p>\n        <p>And whereas, by another agreement made by said Shaeffer with Marion West, of Jackson county, Missouri, dated July 24, 1882, and October 21, 1882, whereby said Marion West sold the interests of Frank West, Thomas West and Joseph C.

The said John I. Blair has given to said Shaeffer a check, signed by the president of the Belvidere National Bank of New Jersey, on the National Park Bank of New York city, for $10,000, to enable said Shaffer to pay that much on account of said lands, and for prudential reasons to obtain a deed for the same in his own name.
