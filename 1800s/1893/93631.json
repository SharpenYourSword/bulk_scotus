The Central Pacific Railroad Company, subject to the same terms and conditions. It is hereby further stipulated that special findings of facts in all of the above-entitled actions are waived. It is hereby further stipulated and agreed that the said case of The People of the State of California v. The Central Pacific Railroad Company shall by the losing party be taken to the supreme court of the United States, and that the decision of said court in said case shall be applicable to, and be treated by each party as the decision of said court in, the above-entitled actions, it being the intention and desire of the parties hereto to save the expense of separate writes of error, and that all the above-entitled actions shall abide the final decision of said supreme court of the United States in the said case of The People of the State of California v. The Central Pacific Railroad Company, provided the said decision shall be made upon points involved therein; and, if not so made, then the judgments</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 15, 1886, the circuit court gave judgment for the defendant in the present case.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of California v. Central Pac. R. Co., referred to in that stipulation, this court did not decide the question now presented, but on April 30, 1888, reversed the judgment of the circuit court on other grounds. 127 U. S. 1, 45, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1073.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 6, 1889, the parties, by another stipulation in writing, agreed that the previous judgment of the circuit court in the present case be set aside, and the case submitted to the circuit court upon an agreed statement of facts, 'on which findings shall be made and conclusions of law drawn by the court.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 6, 1889, the circuit court, pursuant to this stipulation, ordered its former judgment to be set aside, and made and filed findings of fact in accordance with the agreed statement.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By these findings of facts it appeared that, before and at the time of the assessment of these taxes, the defendant owed a debt secured by mortgage of its railroad, its franchise, and its rolling stock and appurtenances, to the amount of more than $3,000 a mile; that the state board of equalization valued and assessed the defendant's franchise, roadway, roadbed, rails, and rolling stock, not separately, but together, (and not including any other kind of property,) at their full value, without deducting the value of the mortgage or any part thereof, although knowing of its existence, and did not deem or treat the mortgage as an interest in the property, and assessed the whole value of the property to the defendant as if there had been no mortgage thereon, but made the assessment upon the same basis for valuation as all other property in the state was valued for the purpose of taxation; and that there were at that time divers railroads in the state owned and operated by corporations other than railroad corporations, and by individuals and partnerships.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the facts found, the circuit court concluded, as matter of law, that the defendant was entitled to judgment. Judgment was entered accordingly, and the state of California sued out this writ of error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The attorney general of the state admitted in his brief, and, when this case was called for argument, stated in open court, the following fact:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'In the year 1893 the defendant offered and tendered to the plaintiff a sum of money equal to the taxes, penalties, interest, and attorney's fee, to recover which this action was brought, and costs of suit, which offer and tender have not been accepted; but the money has been deposited by the defendant in bank, in accordance with the provisions of section 1500 of the Civl Code of California, which reads as follows: 'An obligation for the payment of money is extinguished by a due offer of payment, if the amount is immediately deposited, in the name of the creditor, with some bank of deposit within this state of good repute, and notice thereof is given to the creditor.\"</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">W. H. H. Hart, Atty. Gen. Cal., for the People.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Harvey S. Brown, for defendant in error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice GRAY, after stating the facts in the foregoing language, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the fact most properly and frankly admitted in open court by the attorney general of the state of California, there can be no doubt that this writ of error must be dismissed, because the cause of action has ceased to exist. Any obligation of the defendant to pay to the state the sums sued for in this case, together with interest, penalties, and costs, has been extinguished by the offer to pay all these sums, and the deposit of the money in a bank, which by a statute of the state have the same effect as actual payment and receipt of the money; and the state has obtained everything that is could recover in this case by a judgment of this court in its favor.
