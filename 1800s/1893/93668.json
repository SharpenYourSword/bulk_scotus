The defendant in this case is the successor in title of the Denver and Rio Grande Railway Company, and complied with all the requirements of the act of 1875. The timber, with which it was sought to be charged, was taken early in 1886 for use as cross-ties. About one-half of this timber was taken from the public lands adjacent to the line of the company's road in Montrose County, Colorado, and was used on that portion of its line constructed after June 8, 1882. The rest of the timber was taken from public lands adjacent to the line, constructed prior to June 8, 1882, lying east of Cebolla. The court below held that the defendant had a right to take timber from public lands east of Cebolla for the purpose of repairing its line constructed prior to June 8, 1882, but had no right to take timber from that portion of the line for the purpose of constructing new switches and side tracks along the line of road completed subsequent to June 8, 1882, and for this item, amounting to $1120, the defendant was held liable, and acquiesced in that judgment.

That the complaint in said action shows the amount of timber cut, and that the same was used as railroad ties.</p>\n<p>3. That said timber was cut upon public, unoccupied, and unentered lands of the United States, in Gunnison County, Colorado.</p>\n<p>4. That the lands from which said timber was cut were along, near, or adjacent to the line of railway of said company.</p>\n<p>5. That one-half of the timber cut, as aforesaid, was cut on lands adjacent or near to the portions of said line of railway which were constructed prior to June 8th, 1882, and the other half of said timber was cut from lands near to, adjacent, and along portions of said line of railway constructed and completed after June 8th, 1882.</p>\n<p>6. That the line of railway of the Denver and Rio Grande Railway Company, predecessor in interest and ownership to the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad Company, had not been completed to Santa F\u00e9, on June 8th, 1882, nor has said line of railway ever been so completed either by the Denver and Rio Grande Railway Company or by the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad Company.</p>\n<p>7. That one-fourth of the ties cut, as aforesaid, were used by the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad Company upon various portions of the line of railway formerly owned by the Denver and Rio Grande Railway Company, and subsequently owned by the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad Company, and which portions were constructed and completed prior to June 8th, 1882, said ties being used for purposes of repairs.</p>\n<p>8. That one-fourth of said timber has been used in the construction of new switches and side tracks along the line of road completed subsequent to June 8th, 1882.</p>\n<p>9.
