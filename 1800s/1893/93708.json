H. McDonald, and which suit was subsequently, in August, 1885, dismissed, on motion of the receiver, as settled.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to a written stipulation of the parties, the case was heard by the court without a jury. Judgment was rendered for the defendant in conformity with the opinion of the circuit judge. 35 Fed. Rep. 721, 729; 36 Fed. Rep. 487. The case is before this court upon a certificate of division of opinion.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was evidence on behalf of the plaintiff as to the entent and value of the services rendered, or offered to be rendered, by him as United States district attorney. The defendant introduced evidence tending to show that the plaintiff had neither rendered, nor been requested by the receiver to render, any services in the action against McDonald; that by direction of the comptroller of the currency the receiver employed other counsel; that the plaintiff's present claim had never been presented to the treasury department, nor been allowed by the comptroller of the currency; and that he had not been directed by the solicitor of the treasury to render the alleged services.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following are the questions upon which the judges were divided in opinion:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Whether the United States district attorney is entitled by virtue of his office to appear and act as counsel for the receiver of a national bank in collecting its assets and winding up its affairs without the request or consent of said receiver, and without the direction of the solicitor of the treasury.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Whether, conceding his rights so to appear, and he does so appear, of his own motion, is he entitled to any extra compensation beyond that prescribed by law for his official services?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Whether, conceding his right so to appear and act, he is entitled to any extra compensation beyond that provided by law for his official services, except such as the comptroller of the currency may allow after his claim therefor has been presented to the treasury department, according to the provisions of section 299 of the Revised Statutes.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) Whether the United States district attorney, whose official service had been tendered to such receiver, and declined by him for the reason that he had employed other counsel, acting under the directions of the comptroller of the currency and solicitor of the treasury, is entitled to extra compensation for such offer of services, whether the service was rendered by the district attorney or not.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) Whether, conceding his right so to receive extra compensation when he has offered to appear and act as official counsel without the request or consent of the receiver, is such compensation payable out of the assets of the bank in the hands of the receiver or out of the funds provided by law for the payment of district attorneys for their official services?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robert M.

A distinct provision is made for the salary of a district attorney, and he cannot receive, on that account, any more than the statute prescribes. But the statute is equally explicit in declaring, in respect to compensation that may be 'taxed and allowed,' that he shall receive no other than that specified in sections 823 to 827, inclusive, 'except in cases otherwise expressly provided by law.' It also declares that no officer in any branch of the public service shall receive any additional pay, extra allowance, or compensation in any form whatever, for any service or duty, unless the same is expressly authorized by law, or unless the appropriation therefor explicitly states that it is for such additional pay, extra allowance or compensation. No room is left here for construction. It is not expressly provided by law that a district attorney shall receive compensation for services performed by him in conducting suits arising out of the provisions of the national banking law in which the United States or any of its officers or agents are parties. Without such express provision, compensation for services of that character cannot be taxed, allowed, or paid. Nor can the expenses of the receivership be held to include compensation to the district attorney for conducting a suit in which the receiver is a party, for the obvious reason that the statute does not expressly provide compensation for such services. Congress evidently intended to require the preformance by a district attorney of all the dities imposed upon him by law, without any other remuneration than that coming from his salary, from the compensation or fees authorized to be taxed and allowed, and from such other compensation as is expressly allowed by law specifically on account of services named.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the last clause of section 823 militates against this view. On the contrary, the proper interpretation of that clause supports the conclusion we have reached. Its principal object was to make it clear that congress did not intend to prohibit attorneys, solicitors, and proctors, representing individuals in the courts of the United States, from charging and receiving, in addition to taxable fees or allowances, such compensation as was reasonable under local usage, or such as was agreed upon between them and their clients. But, to prevent the application of that rule of the United States, the words 'other than the government' were inserted. The introduction of those words, in that clause, emphasizes the purpose not to subject the United States to any system for compensating district attorneys except that expressly established by congress, and therefore to withhold from them any compensation for extra or special services, rendered in their official capacity, which is not expressly authorized by statute. Whatever legal services were rendered or offered to be rendered by the plaintiff in the McDonald suit were rendered or offered to be rendered by him as United States district attorney, and in that capacity alone. As such officer, he is not entitled to demand compensation for the services so rendered or offered to be rendered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What we have said is a sufficient answer to the questions certified, and requires an affirmance of the judgment.

For each day of his necessary attendance in a court of the United States on the business of the United States, when the court is held at the place of his abode, five dollars; and for his attendance when the court is held elsewhere, five dollars for each day of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*346</span> term. For travelling from the place of his abode to the place of holding any court of the United States in his district, or to the place of any examination before a judge or commissioner, of a person charged with crime, ten cents a mile for going and ten cents a mile for returning. When an indictment for crime is tried before a jury and a conviction is had, the District Attorney may be allowed, in addition to the attorney's fees herein provided, a counsel fee, in proportion to the importance and difficulty of the cause, not exceeding thirty dollars.</p>\n<p>\"SEC. 825. There shall be taxed and paid to every District Attorney two per centum upon all moneys collected or realized in any suit or proceeding arising under the revenue laws, and conducted by him, in which the United States is a party, which shall be in lieu of all costs and fees in such proceeding.</p>\n<p>\"SEC. 826. No fee shall accrue to any District Attorney on any bond left with him for collection, or in a suit commenced on any bond for the renewal of which provision is made by law, unless the party neglects to apply for such renewal for more than twenty days after the maturity of the bond.</p>\n<p>\"SEC. 827. When a District Attorney appears by direction of the Secretary or Solicitor of the Treasury, on behalf of any officer of the revenue in any suit against such officer, for any act done by him, or for the recovery of any money received by him and paid into the Treasury in the performance of his official duty, he shall receive such compensation as may be certified to be proper by the court in which the suit is brought, and approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.\"</p>\n<p>Another section authorizes just and suitable coinpensation to be made to District Attorneys in prize causes. Rev. Stat. § 4646.</p>\n<p>The above provisions must, however, be construed in connection with sections 1764 and 1765, which are as follows:</p>\n<p>\"SEC. 1764. No allowance or compensation shall be made to any officer or clerk, by reason of the discharge of duties which belong to any other officer or clerk in the same or any other department; and no allowance or compensation shall be made for any extra services whatever, which any officer or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*347</span> clerk may be required to perform, unless expressly authorized by law.</p>\n<p>\"SEC. 1765. No officer in any branch of the public service, or any other person whose salary, pay, or emoluments are fixed by law or regulations, shall receive any additional pay, extra allowance, or compensation, in any form whatever, for the disbursement of public money, or for any other service or duty whatever, unless the same is authorized by law, and the appropriation therefor explicitly states that it is for such additional pay, extra allowance, or compensation.\"</p>\n<p>It ought not to be difficult under any reasonable construction of these statutory provisions to ascertain the intention of Congress. A distinct provision is made for the salary of a District Attorney, and he cannot receive, on that account, any more than the statute prescribes. But the statute is equally explicit in declaring, in respect to compensation that may be \"taxed and allowed,\" that he shall receive no other than that specified in §§ 823 to 827 inclusive, \"except in cases otherwise expressly provided by law.\" It, also, declares that no officer in any branch of the public service shall receive any additional pay, extra allowance, or compensation, in any form whatever, for any service or duty, unless the same is expressly authorized by law, or unless the appropriation therefor explicitly states that it is for such additional pay, extra allowance, or compensation. No room is left here for construction. It is not expressly provided by law that a District Attorney shall receive compensation for services performed by him in conducting suits arising out of the provisions of the national banking law in which the United States or any of its officers or agents are parties. Without such express provision, compensation for services of that character cannot be taxed, allowed, or paid. Nor can the expenses of the receivership be held to include compensation to the District Attorney for conducting a suit in which the receiver is a party, for the obvious reason that the statute does not expressly provide compensation for such services. Congress evidently intended to require the performance by a District Attorney of all the duties imposed upon him by law, without any other remuneration than <span class=\"star-pagination\">*348</span> that coming from his salary, from the compensation or fees authorized to be taxed and allowed, and from such other compensation as is expressly allowed by law specifically on account of services named.</p>\n<p>Nothing in the last clause of § 823 militates against this view. On the contrary, the proper interpretation of that clause supports the conclusion we have reached. Its principal object was to make it clear that Congress did not intend to prohibit attorneys, solicitors, and proctors, representing individuals in the courts of the United States, from charging and receiving, in addition to taxable fees and allowances, such compensation as was reasonable under local usage, or such as was agreed upon between them and their clients. But to prevent the application of that rule to the United States, the words \"other than the government\" were inserted. The introduction of those words, in that clause, emphasizes the purpose not to subject the United States to any system for compensating District Attorneys except that expressly established by Congress, and, therefore, to withhold from them any compensation for extra or special services, rendered in their official capacity, which is not expressly authorized by statute. Whatever legal services were rendered or offered to be rendered by the plaintiff in the McDonald suit were rendered or offered to be rendered by him as United States District Attorney, and in that capacity alone. As such officer he is not entitled to demand compensation for the services so rendered or offered to be rendered</p>\n<p>What we have said is a sufficient answer to the questions certified, and requires an affirmance of the judgment.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 93708, "judges": "Harlan, After Stating the Case", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/93708/", "sha1": "77aaaf48f372d2578abb08af2b6ba1fed1df8f73", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:07:51"}
