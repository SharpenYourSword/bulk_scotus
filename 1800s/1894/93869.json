D.

The case, being tried to a jury, resulted in a verdict in plaintiff's favor, January 10, 1890, for $5,000, and, after motions for a new trial and in arrest had been overruled, judgment was rendered for that amount on May 12, 1890. On the following 19th of May the circuit court, on motion of the defendant's counsel, apparently made ex parte, ordered the judgment to be amended so as to read that the plaintiff recover the sum of $5,000, 'the amount found to be due by the jury, together with the sum of one hundred and sixteen and 73-100 dollars ($116.73), the amount of interest thereon from the rendition of the verdict to date.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These proceedings were had at December term, 1889.
