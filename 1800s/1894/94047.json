Herrick and others, including the Boston Mining &amp; Reduction Company, to establish plaintiffs' alleged prior right to the use of the waters of the San Pedro river for irrigation purposes, and to restrain defendants in respect thereof. The defendant company having, previously to the commencement of the action, conveyed its property to Swan, trustee, the latter was made a defendant, as were numerous others averred to be interested in the use of the waters of the river. The case was tried by the court, a jury being waived, and resulted in certain findings of fact, and a decree adjudging priority of right to the waters of the river&#8212;First, to two of the defendants; second, to plaintiffs; third, fourth, and fifth, to various named defendants, respectively; and that the defendant company, and those claiming under it, or the trustee, were entitled to none of the waters for purposes of irrigation as against any of the parties until the other rights as established were satisfied. The cause was dismissed as against many defendants without prejudice. Motion for new trial was made and overruled, and Swan, trustee, appealed to the supreme court of the territory, and tendered a paper as and for a bond, which was approved and filed by the clerk of the court, and was, omitting the signatures, as follows:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'In the District Court of the First Judicial District of the Territory of Arizona in and for the County of Cochise.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'John Hill et al., Plaintiffs, vs. H.
