If it were necessary, upon this appeal, to consider that question, we would only repeat what was said in McKane v. Durston, 153 U. S. 684, 687, 14 Sup. Ct. 913: 'An appeal from a judgment of conviction is not a matter of absolute right, independently of constitutional or statutory provisions allowing such appeal. A review by an appellate court of the final judgment in a criminal case, however grave the offense of which the accused is convicted, was not at common law, and is not now, a necessary element of due process of law. It is wholly within the discretion of the state to allow or not to allow such a review.' 'It is therefore clear that the right of appeal may be accorded by the state to the accused upon such terms as, in its wisdom, may be proper;' and 'whether an appeal should be allowed, and, if so, under what circumstances or on what conditions, are matters for each state to determine for itself.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether, as is contended, the above statute, in its application to capital cases, is in violation of the constitution of New Jersey, is not necessarily a federal question; and upon that point we need not, therefore, express an opinion. The repugnancy of a statute to the constitution of the state by whose legislature it was enacted cannot authorize a writ of habeas corpus from a court of the United States, unless the petitioner is in custody by virtue of such statute, and unless, also, the statute is in conflict with the constitution of the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The further contention of the accused is that he is restrained of his liberty in violation of the constitution and laws of the United States, in that persons of his race were arbitrarily excluded, solely because of their race, from the panel of jurors summoned for the term of the court at which he was tried, and because the state court denied him the right to establish that fact by competent proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a sufficient answer to this contention that the state court had jurisdiction both of the offense charged and of the accused. By the laws of New Jersey, the court of oyer and terminer and general jail delivery has 'cognizance of all crimes and offences whatsoever which, by law, are or shall be of an indictable or presentable nature, and which have been or shall be committed within the county for which such court shall be held.' Revision, N. J. p. 272, &#167; 30. If the state court, having entered upon the trial of the case, committed error in the conduct of the trial, to the prejudice of the accused, his proper remedy was, after final judgment of conviction, to carry the case to the highest court of the state having jurisdiction to review that judgment; thence, upon writ of error to this court, if the final judgment of such state court denied any right, privilege, or immunity specially claimed, and which was secured to him by the constitution of the United States. Even if it be assumed that the state court improperly denied to the accused, after he had been arraigned, and pleaded 'Not guilty,' the right to show by proof that persons of his race were arbitrarily excluded by the sheriff from the panel of grand or petit jurors solely because of their race, it would not follow that the court lost jurisdiction of the case, within the meaning of the well-established rule that a prisoner under conviction and sentence of another court will not be discharged on habeas corpus unless the court that passed the sentence was so far without jurisdiction that its proceedings must be regarded as void.

When a state court has entered upon the trial of a criminal case, under a statute not repugnant to the constitution of the United States, and has jurisdiction of the offense and of the accused, no mere error in the conduct of the trial should be made the basis of jurisdiction in a court of the United States to review the proceedings upon writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The application to the circuit court for a writ of habeas corpus was properly denied, and the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>156 U.S. 272 (1895)</b></center>\n<center><h1>ANDREWS<br>\nv.<br>\nSWARTZ.</h1></center>\n<center>No. 710.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Submitted January 21, 1895.</center>\n<center>Decided February 4, 1895.</center>\nAPPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY.\n<p><i>Mr. George M.

The repugnancy of a statute to the constitution of the State by whose legislature it was enacted cannot authorize a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> from a court of the United States unless the petitioner is in custody by virtue of such statute, and unless also the statute is in conflict with the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p>The further contention of the accused is that he is restrained of his liberty in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States, in that persons of his race were arbitrarily excluded, solely because of their race, from the panel of jurors summoned for the term of the court at which he was tried, and because the state court denied him the right to establish that fact by competent proof.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*276</span> It is a sufficient answer to this contention that the state court had jurisdiction both of the offence charged and of the accused. By the laws of New Jersey the Court of Oyer and Terminer and general jail delivery has \"cognizance of all crimes and offences whatsoever which, by law, are or shall be of an indictable or presentable nature, and which have been or shall be committed within the county for which such court shall be held.\" Rev. Stat. N.J. 272, § 30. If the state court, having entered upon the trial of the case, committed error in the conduct of the trial to the prejudice of the accused, his proper remedy was, after final judgment of conviction, to carry the case to the highest court of the State having jurisdiction to review that judgment, thence upon writ of error to this court, if the final judgment of such state court denied any right, privilege, or immunity specially claimed, and which was secured to him by the Constitution of the United States. Even if it be assumed that the state court improperly denied to the accused, after he had been arraigned and pleaded not guilty, the right to show by proof that persons of his race were arbitrarily excluded by the sheriff from the panel of grand or petit jurors solely because of their race, it would not follow that the court lost jurisdiction of the case within the meaning of the well-established rule that a prisoner under conviction and sentence of another court will not be discharged on <i>habeas corpus</i> unless the court that passed the sentence was so far without jurisdiction that its proceedings must be regarded as void. <i>Ex parte Siebold,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90042\"><a href=\"/opinion/90042/ex-parte-siebold/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span>, 375; <i>In re Wood,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"93092\"><a href=\"/opinion/93092/in-re-wood/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span>, 287; <i>In re Shibuya Jugiro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"93093\"><a href=\"/opinion/93093/in-re-shibuya-jugiro/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span>, 297; <i>Pepke</i> v. <i>Cronan,</i> 155 U.S. 100. When a state court has entered upon the trial of a criminal case, under a statute not repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, and has jurisdiction of the offence and of the accused, no mere error in the conduct of the trial should be made the basis of jurisdiction in a court of the United States to review the proceedings upon writ of <i>habeas corpus.</i></p>\n<p>The application to the Circuit Court for a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> was properly denied, and the judgment must be</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 94093, "judges": "Harlan", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/94093/", "sha1": "645ae715291147dac4dcaf3713000bd946157065", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:21:51"}
