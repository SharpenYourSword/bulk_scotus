In Webster's Dictionary of 1890 \"draught\" is defined as \"an allowance on weighable goods;\" and \"draft\" as \"an allowance or deduction made from the gross weight of goods.\" In the Century and the Imperial, \"draft\" and \"draught\" are spoken of as an allowance made for waste in goods sold by weight, or the allowance made by the custom-house on excisable goods. The two words are in reality different spellings of the same word.</p>\n<p>In <i>Napier</i> v. <i>Barney,</i> 5 Blatchford, 191, both draft and tare were allowed on sugar imported in bags, Mr. Justice Nelson observing: \"Draft and tare, in a commercial sense and usage, have a separate and distinct meaning and application. The former is an allowance to the merchant when the duty is ascertained by weight, as in the present instance to insure good weight to him... .

If this seed had been washed or otherwise cleansed of these impurities, it certainly will not be contended that they would be subject to an increased duty by means of such cleansing, or that a bushel of 56 pounds of such seed would be anything more or less than a statutory bushel.

And as it appeared that dried ore was not known to commerce, that the allowance between dealers for the moisture that would be expelled by heating the ore had been based upon express contract or stipulation, and that no custom existed authorizing such allowance, except by contract, it was held that the tariff act referred to ore in its natural state.

Seeberger, collector of customs, to recover an alleged excess of duties paid under protest upon an importation of flaxseed. The circuit court entered judgment for the plaintiff. 44 Fed. 258. Defendant brought error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was an action against the collector of customs for the port and district of Chicago to recover certain duties paid, under protest, upon an importation of flaxseed which contained 4 per cent. of impurities. The only question in the case was whether the importers were entitled to an allowance, from the gross weight of the goods, of a percentage for impurities.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried without a jury under a stipulation, and the following facts found by the court:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Plaintiff imported a quantity of flaxseed from Liverpool, which had been brought from Calcutta. The invoices show the gross weight and a tare of five pounds per bag, and a deduction of 'four per cent. for impurities.' The collector, in assessing the duties, deducted the tare, which was the weight of the bags, but refused to allow anything for impurities, assessing a duty of twenty cents per bushel of fifty-six pounds upon the gross weight, less the tare. Plaintiff paid the duties so assessed under protest, appealed to the secretary of the treasury, by whom the action of the collector was affirmed, and brought this suit in apt time to recover the excess of duties paid by reason of the refusal to make any deduction for impurities.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The proof in this case shows without dispute that the seed contained dust, composed of clay, sand, and gravel, to an average of four per cent.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon this finding of facts, the court entered judgment for the plaintiff, assessing its damages at $670.29, with interest.
