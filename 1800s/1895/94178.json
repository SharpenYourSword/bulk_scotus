Rep. 465. The jurisdiction of this court is invoked upon the ground that the only question in the case was as to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, but that question was not certified to this court by the Circuit Court for decision, and the writ of error must be dismissed upon the authority of <i>Maynard</i> v. <i>Hecht,</i> 151 U.S. 324; <i>Colvin</i> v. <i>Jacksonville, ante,</i> 368, and cases cited.</p>\n<p><i>Writ of error dismissed.</i></p>\n</div>",
