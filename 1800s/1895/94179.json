This judgment was rendered December 3, 1890. The writ of error from this court was brought November 24, 1891. The only ground relied on to sustain the jurisdiction of this court is that the case \"involves the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States;\" because plaintiff in error was deprived of the right of trial by jury.
