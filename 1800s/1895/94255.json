It had at different times executed mortgages,&#8212;one upon the main line, covering the railway, rolling stock, and franchises held or thereafter to be acquired, securing bonds to the amount of $5,400,000; one, subsequent in date, upon the Milwaukee extension, securing bonds to the amount of $2,200,000; one, later in date, upon the Muscatine Western extension, securing bonds to the amount of $800,000; and one, still later in date, upon the Pacific extension, securing bonds in the sum of $1,800,000; and, finally, one known as the 'income and equipment mortgage,' which was a second mortgage upon the railway and branches, and purporting to be a first mortgage upon the income and upon certain rolling stock not covered by the first mortgages.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the 15th day of May, 1875, Charles L. Frost, as surviving trustee in the 'mainline' mortgage, filed in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Iowa an original bill against the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Minnesota Railway Company, as sole defendant, to foreclose the mortgage on the main line. By amendment the Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Company was made a party defendant upon an averment that said company were trustees in a mortgage executed subsequent to the plaintiffs' mortgage, and praying that 'their lien on the income and equipment of said road may be declared subsequent to that of the plaintiffs', and they may be decreed to redeem plaintiffs' mortgage, or their equity be barred and foreclosed, and for such other relief as the plaintiffs' case may require.' A demurrer to this bill had been filed by the railway company, and, after the Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Company was added as a party defendant, it joined in the demurrer.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The several trustees in the Milwaukee extension mortgage and the Muscatine extension mortgage likewise filed in the same court foreclosure bills, in which, by amendment, the Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Company was made a party defendant, and as to which the same relief was prayed as that contained in the bill filed by Frost, trustee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 23, 1875, the Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Company, as trustee in the mortgage on the Pacific division, and as trustee in the income and equipment mortgage, filed an original bill against the railway company, praying a foreclosure of both of said mortgages. In that portion of the bill that dealt with the income and equipment mortgage it was alleged that said mortgage was a first lien on 2 engines, known as Nos. 30 and 31, and upon 130 box cars, known as the even numbers from 882 to 1140. An answer was filed by the railway company, not traversing or denying the allegations of the bill as respected the mortgage on the Pacific division, but denying that as many equipment or income bonds had been sold as were averred to have been sold. On the 30th of October, 1875, the case came on for hearing, and a final decree was entered, ordering that the property covered by the Pacific division mortgage be sold without appraisement or redemption at public auction, etc., but ordering that 'that portion of complainants' bill relating to the 'income and equipment mortgage,' so called, is ordered to be consolidated with the causes pending in this court against said respondent, wherein said Frost, Taylor, and others are, respectively, complainants.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day on which this decree was entered there was filed in the cause wherein Charles L. Frost and others, trustees, were plaintiffs, and the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Minnesota Railway Company was defendant, an answer on behalf of the Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Company, in which it was admitted that the deed of trust to Frost was a first lien upon the main line and upon the ordinary rolling stock used thereon, not included in the mortgages executed by the company, known as the Pacific, Milwaukee, and Muscatine Western mortgages, and not including also engines Nos. 30 and 31, and box cars Nos. 882 to 1140.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day the Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Company filed a cross bill against the complainants in the several bills of complaint heretofore mentioned. The prayer of this cross bill was as follows: 'Wherefore your orator prays that said several suits be consolidated; that an equitable portion, as above shown, be decreed as against all of said parties to be included in said deed of trust (the income mortgage), and that the same be properly designated as proper to be sold with said division under said mortgage; and that your orator have a decree declaring its lien upon said two engines 30 and 31 and said 130 box cars, under said mortgage, to be prior and paramount to any held by any of said trustees and parties.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record discloses that on October 30, 1875, the causes were ordered to be consolidated; the defendant railway company withdrew its demurrers, pleas, and answers in the said several causes; and thereupon 'said several causes and said consolidated cause came on for final hearing and trial before the court on the several bills of complaint, the amended bill, the several mortgages and deeds of trust, and the proofs.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decree found the amount remaining due and unpaid on the bonds secured by the main-line mortgage, and adjudged the defendant to pay the same within 10 days, in default of which payment its equity of redemption was to be forever barred, and W. M. Kaiser was appointed a special master to advertise and sell said main line and its franchises and appurtenant property 'without redemption or appraisement,' and it was ordered that James Grant be a special trustee to purchase the property for all holders of bonds secured by the main-line mortgage who shall assent to such purchase, and pay their share of the expenses, and he was ordered to convey the property, under the direction of the court or one of its judges, to such corporation as such bondholders may organize to hold the title thus acquired for the benefit of the whole or such part as should assent thereto.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pending the foreclosure proceedings, a new corporation, called the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Northern Railway Company, was formed for the purpose of purchasing the several mortgaged properties at the foreclosure sales. On the 22d day of June, 1876, the main line was sold by the master to a committee, who purchased for the benefit of all bondholders, and who directed that a conveyance be made by deed to the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Northern Railway Company. On the same day the Muscatine Western extension was sold to the same purchasers, and at their request a deed was made to the said new company. Likewise, on the same day, the Pacific division was sold by the master named in that decree; and the purchaser, John I. Blair, acting as trustee for the bondholders of the Pacific division, directed that the conveyance should be made to the said new company.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The masters making these sales executed deeds of the main line and of the several branches to the said the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Northern Railway Company, conveying in terms an absolute title to the property described in each deed. The reports of the several sales, accompanied by the deeds executed by the masters, were submitted to the court for approval, as required by the decree, and on July 20, 1876, the circuit court judge approved said sales and deeds, and ordered the property to be delivered to said new company as of July 1, 1876.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plan of reorganization provided for the execution of a mortgage of the entire property of the new company to the amount of $6,500,000, and such a mortgage, bearing date 1st of September, 1875, was, on November 9, 1876, executed and delivered to the Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Company, as trustee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appears that the stock and bonds of the new organization were put upon the market, and have been bought and sold as mercantile securities since their issue in 1876.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February, 1882, the Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Company addressed to the holders of the income and equipment bonds of the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Minnesota Railway Company, and to Hubbard, Clark, and Dawley, attorneys of some of said bonds, a communication, resigning as trustee under the income and equipment mortgage.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 13, 1883, there was presented to the district judge of the United States for the Southern district of Iowa a petition of one Lawrence Turnure and others, claiming to be holders of income and equipment bonds of the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Minnesota Railway Company. The petition alleged the resignation as trustee of the Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Company, asked that Charles E. Simmons should be appointed trustee, and that he should be authorized, as such, to file an 'amended and supplemental cross bill in the nature of a bill of revivor and supplement,' and that he be permitted to bring in new parties in accordance with such amended and supplemental cross bill.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this petition an order was indorsed by the judge, appointing Simmons trustee, and giving him leave to file his cross bill in the nature of a bill of revivor and supplement, 'subject to the right of all parties interested to move the vacation of this order after process to or appearance of the defendants.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the following day the cross bill of Charles E. Simmons, as trustee succeeding the Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Company, was filed against Frederick Taylor, as successor to Charles L. Frost, trustee, the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Minnesota Railway Company, the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Northern Railway Company, and the Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Company.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This cross bill set up a history of the proceedings, not differing in substantial particulars from the statement herein previously made, but claimed that in no proceeding had there been any adjudication, determination, decree, or order in any manner affecting or determining the rights of the Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Company as trustee under the income and equipment mortgage, or of the bondholders claiming under said mortgage.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cross bill prayed for an account to be rendered by the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Northern Railway Company of the earnings of the main line since the said company had had control and management of the same, and prayed for a decree permitting the complainant to redeem the said main line upon payment of the amount did by the committee of bondholders at the foreclosure sale, less the profits and gains ascertained by the accounting prayed for, and that upon such redemption the complainant should be decreed to take the title to said railway, franchises, and property free and clear from the trust deed of Frost and the decree of the court in his behalf, and from all rights of the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Northern Railway Company in the property, and that the trust deed or mortgage from the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Northern Railway Company to the Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Company, trustee, and the lien thereof, be utterly canceled as to said main line, and as to the complainant and bondholders claiming under said trust deed.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Issue was made by answer filed by the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Northern Railway Company, in which answer, among other things, that company denied that there had been no adjudication determining the rights of the trustee under the income and equipment mortgage, and denied that any right of redemption remained in the Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Company, or in its successors, after the sale under the decree of October 30, 1875. This answer likewise denied that the bonds held by those on whose behalf the cross bill was filed by Simmons were ever legally issued.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 28, 1883, the Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Company filed its answer to the cross bill. In this answer it was averred that the Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Company had, in fact or law, no valid claims to the said engines and box cars, except subject to the prior claims of the other mortgages, and that all such claims were cut off and foreclosed by the sale under the decree of October 30, 1875.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Replications were filed and evidence taken, and on October 28, 1885, an opinion and decree were filed, finding: First, that the income and equipment mortgage was a valid lien upon the main line of the railway, and that the right of redemption under it had not been foreclosed by the decree of October 30, 1875, nor by the sale thereunder; second, that the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Northern Railway Company was entitled to redeem the main line by paying off the income and equipment mortgage; third, that in event such redemption shall not be made, then the bondholders secured by the income and equipment mortgage shall be entitled to redeem said main line of railway by paying into court the amount due thereon, as the same shall be determined in the manner provided in the decree; fourth, that in the event of neither of these redemptions taking place, the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Minnesota Railway Company shall be entitled to redeem said main line by paying off the amount due on the deed of trust or deeds of trust against which such redemptions shall be made; fifth, in the event that neither the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Northern Railway Company nor the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Minnesota Railway Company shall so redeem, then the income and equipment mortgage shall be foreclosed, and a sale of the property had, and the proceeds be applied&#8212;First, to the payment of the bonds issued under the main-line mortgage; and, second, the amount, thereafter to be determined, that shall be due upon the income and equipment mortgage. The cause was then referred to a master to determine sundry matters stated in the decree.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this decree an appeal was taken to this court, which appeal was dismissed, for the reason that the decree appealed from was not a final decree. Railway Co. v. Simmons, 123 U. S. 52, 8 Sup. Ct. 58. Subsequently a report was filed by the master, which was excepted to by Simmons, trustee, and by the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Northern Railway Company. This report and the exceptions thereto were passed upon by the court below in an opinion filed on May 15, 1889, reported in 38 Fed. 683; and on May 29, 1889, a final decree was entered in accordance with the opinion of the court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this decree the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Northern Railway Company appeals, as well from so much thereof as finds the cross complainant entitled to redeem at all as from those portions thereof which affirm the validity of any of the bonds, and which hold the railway company bound to account; and the cross complainant appeals from such portions thereof as find invalid some of the bonds asserted in the cross bill.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Charles A.

Co.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice SHIRAS delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decisive questions in this case turn on the character and effect of the decree entered on October 30, 1875. Did that decree leave the rights of the second mortgage, known as the 'income and equipment mortgage,' unadjudicated, and thereby subject the purchasers at the sale under the decree to a future inquiry into those rights, or was the decree final as respects the property sold thereunder, and do the purchasers, the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Northern Railway Company, hold the property free from the lien of the second mortgage?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The answer to these questions must be found in the allegations and proofs upon which the decree was based, as well as in the terms of the decree itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record shows that all the parties to be affected by the decree were before the court,&#8212;the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Minnesota Railway Company as a mortgage debtor in default, and the trustees in the several mortgages. The property against which the proceedings were aimed was a railroad consisting of a main road and several branches. That the railway company was insolvent, and utterly unable to satisfy decrees for the payment of money, was evident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In such circumstances, what kind of a decree would be probable, and in the natural course of events? Would it not be expected that the proceedings would eventuate in a sale, in such a way as to dispose of the questions raised in the several cases, and to vest in the purchasers an unincumbered title to the entire railway system?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We learn from the pleadings and evidence that such a plan of sale was apparently pursued, and resulted in the organization of a new company, whose mortgage bonds and stock were distributed among the original bondholders upon terms satisfactory to all, including a number of those who likewise held bonds secured by the income mortgage. The sales were reported to the court, and, with the deeds in pursuance thereof, were duly approved. The new company went into possession and management of the railroad and branches, and has increased largely their value by important extensions. The bonds and stock of the new company, it is safe to presume, have gone largely into new hands. The possession and title of the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Northern Railway Company remained undisturbed and unchallenged till April, 1883,&#8212;a period of more than seven years,&#8212;when the petition of certain alleged bondholders under the income mortgage was filed, asking leave to file what is termed 'an amended and supplemental cross bill in the nature of a bill of revivor and supplement,' the avowed purpose of which is to have the title of the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Northern Railway Company declared subject to the lien of the income mortgage, to have the mortgage issued in pursuance of the plan of reorganization declared void as respects the main line, and to hold that company to account for the earnings during the period of its possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To constrain a court of equity to grant relief so apparently inconsistent with the previous proceedings, and so destructive of the rights of persons who have since become interested, the case presented should be clear and free from doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What, then, are the reasons urged in favor of the complainant in the amended and supplemental cross bill?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is claimed, in the first place, that the Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Company, a party in the cause as trustee named in the income and equipment mortgage, had an equitable right to redeem; and that, as the decree of October, 1875, contained no declaration or recital that said trustee was barred of the equity of redemption, and as no time was given to it to redeem from the first mortgages, the rights of the trustee and of the income bondholders were wholly unaffected by the decree and by the sales in accordance therewith. In other words, the proposition is that in a decree which orders a sale of the property to pay the first mortgage debt, an express order cutting off the equity of redemption of a junior mortgagee, although a party to the suit, is necessary to divest the latter of his lien and of his right of redemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are unwilling to accept this as a sound statement of the law, or, at all events, to concede it as invariably true. Where a junior mortgagee is a party defendant to a foreclosure bill in which, as in the present case, there is a prayer that he be decreed to redeem, and where the priority of the plaintiff's mortgage is found or conceded, and a sale is ordered in default of payment, declaring the right of the debtor to redeem to be forever barred, we do not deem a similar order as to right of redemption by the junior mortgagee to be substantially, or even formally, necessary. He has, of course, a right to redeem, but, if he chooses not to assert such right, and stands by while the sale is made and confirmed, he must, in equity, be deemed to have waived his right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the law was correctly stated by Mr. Justice Matthews in Railroad Co. v. Fosdick, 106 U. S. 68, 1 Sup. Ct. 10, where he said: 'In case the proceeding results finally in a sale of the mortgaged premises, the sale is made free from the equity of redemption of the mortgagee and all holders of junior incumbrances, if made parties to the suit, and is of the whole premises, when necessary to the payment of the amount due, or when the property is not properly divisible, it conveys a clear and absolute title as against all parties to the suit, or their privies, and the proceeds of the sale are distributed, after payment of the amount due for nonpayment of which the sale was ordered, in satisfaction of the unpaid debt remaining, whether due or not.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So in Lansing v. Goelet, 9 Cow. 346, in which case there was an elaborate examination of the subject, the law was expressed in the following terms: 'A judicial sale of the estate under the decree of the court, if the court has power to make the decree, whether it be in the form of a decree of sale preceded by a formal decree of foreclosure, or in the form of a decree of sale without the formal decree of foreclosure, effectually bars the right of the mortgagor to redeem, and the purchaser will hold it under the title he acquires to it by virtue of the sale and conveyance he receives from the master, free and discharged from the equity of redemption. The purchase money then stands in the place of the estate, and will be applicable, as that was, first, to the satisfaction of the debt of the mortgagee, and the overplus and residue, if any, to the use of the mortgagor.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 3 Pom. Eq. Jur. &#167; 1228, it is said that 'the sale under a valid decree immediately cuts off, bars, and forecloses the rights of the mortgagor and of all subsequent grantees, owners, incumbrancers, and other persons interested who were made parties defendant, and of all grantees, owners, and incumbrancers subsequent to a filing of notice of lis pendens, although not made defendant.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is contended, in the next place, that the rights of the junior mortgagee were saved by the express terms of the decree. The language relied upon was as follows: 'And this decree is made subject to the rights of any intervening creditors now before this court, and the claim of the Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Company in the income and equipment mortgage to any of the cars and machinery named in that mortgage is to be submitted to this court in term time or vacation, as soon as counsel can agree on the facts in relation thereto.' And again: 'The court reserves the power to make further orders and directions, and no sale under this decree is to be binding until reported to the court for its approval.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reliance is also placed upon the language of a subsequent order of the court, on October 26, 1876, in which, after affirming the sales and conveyances, it is said that said order 'shall in no wise be taken to affect any claim, right, interest, or lien upon or to the property sold and conveyed by said master's deeds, now pending in this court, but that the said claim, rights, interests, and liens are merely reserved, subject to future adjudication; and the said grantees in said deeds take the property hereby conveyed subject thereto.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The construction sought to be put upon this language, namely, that the court thereby intended to make a future disposition of the claims of the income and equipment mortgage one of the terms of the sale, is an admissible one, and, if it had been urged by timely action, it might properly have been adopted. But, as we have seen, those interested under the income and equipment mortgage not only failed to embrace the opportunity afforded to redeem as against the first mortgages, but suspended all action for a period of more than seven years. The condition of the record as it existed before the filing of the amended and supplemental cross bill disclosed no intention to ask for a redemption, and, even if the condition of the case prior to the sale and the terms of the decree left it a debatable matter whether the court intended to bar any right of redemption on the part of the junior mortgage, we think the contemporaneous and subsequent conduct of those interested in that mortgage deprives them of any right, after so long a period, to demand the assistance of a court of equity as against the purchasers and those who may have become interested with them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not find it necessary to determine whether those of the bondholders under the income and equipment mortgage, and who also held first mortgage bonds, estopped themselves from asserting a right of redemption by accepting the new securities issued under the plan of reorganization. If, indeed, those so acting constituted all of the income bondholders, such a determination might be a ready method of disposing of the entire case. But, as there seems to have been some who did not receive the new bonds in payment of first mortgage bonds, and would not, therefore, be brought within the range of the suggested estoppel, we prefer to pass by that question, and consider whether all the holders of bonds under the income and equipment mortgage did not, by their inaction and acquiescence under the decree and sale, lose any right to redeem which they might otherwise have had as against the purchasers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have seen, the Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Company, in its answer and cross bill as they stood before and at the time of the decree of October 30, 1875, did not assert any right or any intention to redeem, although in the bill an opportunity was afforded it so to do. It restricted its allegations and claims for relief entirely to the engines and box cars. When the cases, as well the case of Frost, trustee, in respect to the foreclosure of the main line, and the other consolidated bills of foreclosure, came on to be heard, there was no assertion of any right or wish to redeem. There was record notice to the said trustee that a plan of sale and reorganization was intended which contemplated the issue of new stock and bonds. Not only was there a tacit acquiescence in the proceedings, but no sign of any intention to disturb the title of the purchasers was given until more than seven years had elapsed, during which period large expenditures were made, and, beyond a doubt, third persons had become interested on the faith of that title.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principle upon which this ground of defense rests has been so often vindicated and applied by this court that we do not feel it necessary to further enforce it by argument, nor to cite cases so numerous. It is sufficient to refer to Abraham v. Ordway, 158 U. S. 416, 15 Sup. Ct. 894.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule is aptly expressed by 2 Pom. Eq. Jur. &#167; 816, as follows: 'Acquiescence is an important factor in determining equitable rights and remedies in obedience to the maxims, 'He who seeks equity must do equity,' and 'He who comes into equity must come with clean hands.' Even when it does not work a true estoppel upon rights of property or of contract, it may operate in analogy to estoppel&#8212;may produce a quasi estoppel&#8212;upon the rights of remedy.' And in section 965: 'When a party, with full knowledge, or at least with sufficient notice or means of knowledge, of his rights, and of all the material facts, freely does what amounts to a recognition of the transaction as existing, or acts in a manner inconsistent with its repudiation, or lies by for a considerable time, and knowingly permits the other party to deal with the subject-matter under the belief that the transaction has been recognized, or freely abstains for a considerable length of time from impeaching it, so that the other party is thereby reasonably induced to suppose that it is recognized, there is acquiescence; and the transaction, although originally impeachable, becomes unimpeachable in equity. Even where there has been no act nor language properly amounting to an acquiescence, a mere delay, a suffering time to elapse unreasonably, may of itself be a reason why courts of equity refuse to exercise their jurisdiction in cases of actual and constructive fraud, as well as in other instances. It has always been a principle of equity to discourage stale demands.

The decree in that court was made in a cause in which were consolidated four suits: A libel for salvage against the Eliza Lines, her cargo and freight; a libel for possession by the cargo-owners against the cargo; a libel by the master against cargo and cargo-owners for freight and general average, and a libel by a bottomry lender against the vessel and freight. The Eliza Lines, a Norwegian bark, was bound on a voyage from Pensacola to Montevideo with a cargo of lumber, under a charter party, \"the dangers of the seas, fire and navigation always mutually excepted.\" It was abandoned, justifiably, in consequence of dangers of the seas, and was afterwards picked up by salvors and brought into Boston on September 19, 1889. The master was notified by the owners and came on from St. John, New Brunswick, arriving on September 21. The cargo-owners <span class=\"star-pagination\">*126</span> (Ward &amp; Co.) and the master both demanded possession of the cargo from the salvors, but the salvors retained possession and filed their libel for salvage on September 26. The next day the master filed a claim for ship and cargo and within an hour Ward &amp; Co. filed their claim for the cargo as above mentioned. On October 5 the vessel was delivered to the master, and on October 18 the master moved for a delivery of the cargo to him upon stipulation in order to resume his voyage, while Ward &amp; Co. moved that the cargo be sold on the ground that its value was rapidly diminishing by reason of charges and costs. The former motion was denied and the latter granted on November 16. On November 27 the master filed his libel for freight and general average. The Circuit Court, reversing the decision of the District Court, held that the master should have been allowed to complete the voyage and earn freight, and charged the cargo-owners personally with the net freight that would have been earned, with other particulars not necessary to mention. 61 Fed. Rep. 308; 102 Fed. Rep. 184. The decree was affirmed with a slight variation by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 114 Fed. Rep. 307.</p>\n<p>The question is whether the abandonment of the vessel by the master and crew gave the cargo-owners a right to refuse to go on with the voyage in the circumstances disclosed; in other words, whether the cargo-owners properly were treated as guilty of a breach of contract for preventing the continuance of the voyage by their refusal and by procuring a sale. It will be noticed that the decree must stand on the ground that the contract was broken by the cargo-owners and that the ship-owners were entitled to recover under it, although the voyage was not completed. The decree was not upon a new contract such as it was attempted to set up in <i>Hopper</i> v. <i>Burness,</i> 1 C.P.D. 137, or upon the analogy of a <i>quantum meruit</i> at common law, which was expressly disavowed. The very foundation of a recovery upon the latter ground is that the express contract is out of the way, but that a benefit has been received which ought to be paid for. Therefore, in such a case the recovery cannot exceed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> the benefit, as often has been explained in the books. <i>Gillis</i> v. <i>Cobe,</i> 177 Massachusetts, 584; Keener, Quasi-Contracts, Ch. 4. See <i>Flaherty</i> v. <i>Doane,</i> 1 Lowell, 148, 150. In the case at bar, while the District Court allowed freight pro rata as a charge on the proceeds of the cargo, the Circuit Court of Appeals held the cargo-owners personally for a sum much exceeding that amount, and therefore much exceeding the benefit actually received. It will not be necessary to consider the decree of the District Court, since that was not appealed from by the cargo-owners, and we shall not discuss the effect of the judicial sale, as it is not necessary in the view which we take.</p>\n<p>There is not doubt that the English decisions confidently assert the cargo-owners' right to refuse to go on. They may be read in the reports, and there is no need to do more than to refer to them. <i>The Arno,</i> 8 Asp. Mar. Cas. 5; <i>The Leptir,</i> 5 Asp. Mar. Cas. 411; <i>The Argonaut,</i> Shipping Gazette, Weekly Summary, Dec. 5, 1884, p. 775; <i>The Cito,</i> 7 P.D. 5; <i>The Kathleen,</i> L.R. 4 Ad. &amp; Ec. 269. The only point which they leave open is whether, if the master should get the abandoned vessel and cargo back from the salvors before the cargo-owners had declared an election to end the contract, he might in that way revive his right to finish the voyage. On that point it is enough to say here that if the English rule is right, then, even if there is any such qualification to it, the exception must depend upon something more substantial than a few minutes' priority in filing a libel, when neither master nor cargo-owner has possession either of cargo or ship, as, plainly, neither had in this case.</p>\n<p>The right of cargo-owners to treat the contract as ended by the abandonment of the ship was asserted much earlier than the English cases by Judge Ware in <i>The Elizabeth and Jane,</i> 1 Ware, 41, <i>S.C.</i> 15 Fed. Cas. 478, Case No. 8321, and earlier still by Mr. Story before he became a justice of this Court, in his edition of Abbott on Shipping (1810), pp. 338, 512, citing <i>Dunnett</i> v. <i>Tomhagen,</i> 3 Johns. 154, and <i>Mason</i> v. <i>Ship Blaireau,</i> 2 Cranch, 240. We see nothing in <i>The Nathaniel Hooper,</i> 3 Sumner, 542, sufficient <span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> to prove that he changed his opinion. That case is cited in 3 Kent Comm., 13th ed. 228, along with <i>Post</i> v. <i>Robertson,</i> 1 Johns. 24, in which and in <i>Dunnett</i> v. <i>Tomhagen, supra</i><i>,</i> the Supreme Court of New York and Chief Justice Kent took the same general view, subject to the question whether there might be a recovery on a <i>quantum meruit</i> when benefits were accepted under the contract, in spite of a failure of complete performance. See <i>Caze</i> v. <i>Baltimore Ins. Co.,</i> 7 Cranch, 358, 362. 3 Kent Comm. 229. Other cases are <i>The Mansanito,</i> 22 Fed. Cas. 594, No. 13,075. <i>The James Martin,</i> 88 Fed. Rep. 649. See also 3 Kent Comm. 196. In short, we are aware of no decision in this country or in England before the present case which casts any doubt upon the rule.</p>\n<p>It was thought by the Circuit Court and Circuit Court of Appeals that the doctrine so unanimously sanctioned by so many of the most eminent judges of this country and of England is unjust, and the case was put of a long voyage nearly completed and the ship and cargo subsequently brought by salvors intact to the port of destination. But we are of opinion that there is no injustice in holding that what excuses the ship excuses the cargo, and that the rule is in accord with the general principles of contract. Subject to the question whether the cargo-owners broke their contract, it seems to us more unjust to charge them personally, in favor of those who failed to complete the voyage as contemplated, with a sum much exceeding the benefit which the cargo-owners received from what was done. Of course it is desirable, if there is no injustice, that the maritime law of this country and of England should agree.</p>\n<p>To begin at a distance, a repudiation of a contract, amounting to a breach, warrants the other party in going no further in performance on his side. <i>Roehm</i> v. <i>Horst,</i> 178 U.S. 1. But the same thing is true of an absolute repudiation not amounting to a breach. <i>Frost</i> v. <i>Knight,</i> L.R. 7 Ex. 111, 113; <i>Phillpotts</i> v. <i>Evans,</i> 5 M. &amp; W. 475, 477; <i>Ballou</i> v. <i>Billings,</i> 136 Massachusetts, 307, 309.</p>\n<p>It appears to us and we shall try to prove that an abandonment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> of the ship must be regarded as a renunciation of the contract, even if not a repudiation of its terms as binding. It is an overt act which is more than an attempt to give up the voyage. It not merely makes the completion of the voyage so improbable, by reason of the helplessness in which the ship is left and the intent with which the act is done, as practically to destroy the value of the contract to the cargo-owner, see <i>Swift and Company</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 196 U.S. 375, 396, it is a present failure to do what the contract requires, if the purposes of the contract are to be carried out. The requirement is shown by the fact that the abandonment would be a cause of action unless justified. It not only would be a breach of contract but no one questions that it would authorize a rescission of the contract on the other side, which not every breach of contract does. That it would authorize rescission or refusal to allow the master to change his mind if the vessel was saved shows that a continuous intent and effort to go on with the voyage is an essential condition to the obligation to pay freight. It shows, what needs no illustration, that the continuous care of the master is the main object of the cargo-owners' interest in the contract. By the general principles of contract an open cessation of performance with the intent to do no more, even if justified, excuses the other party from further performance on his side. The principle is not peculiar to charter parties, it is illustrated in other parts of the law. See <i>Roehm</i> v. <i>Horst,</i> 178 U.S. 1.</p>\n<p>In the case at bar the vessel was abandoned with the intent not to return to her or to complete the voyage. This is admitted, if admission be necessary, by the testimony of the master. Of course it is not disputed that the completion of the voyage and delivery of the cargo are absolute conditions to the undertaking to pay freight, by the express terms of the contract and the familiar rule of law. 3 Kent Comm. 220, 228. The master left ship and cargo to their fate, and we cannot doubt, although it was denied, that, after he had done so, if the cargo-owners had been the salvors they could have treated the voyage as at an end. The ground must be that the abandonment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> was more than an attempt, or a mere offer of rescission which might be revoked by the master before acceptance, and that it was an unequivocal departure from the conditions which the contract imposed. If the abandonment had been unjustified and a breach of contract, of course it would not have ended the contract, but would have left the choice whether to end it or not to the cargo-owner. If justified, the simplest view would be that it was so because the contract authorized the master to end it when prevented from performance by perils of the sea, and that the contract was ended. But at all events, as control of the ship and voyage was given up and never regained, the abandonment at least gave an irrevocable power to the cargo-owners to decline to be further bound. See, in addition to cases cited above, 3 Kent Comm. 196. The opposite view must be that the master still is bound to go on with the voyage notwithstanding his justifiable abandonment, if a chance should turn up, a view which leaves his duties in a very ambiguous shape, or else that the master has the choice, which gives the election to the party whose act has made the trouble, as against the party that has done nothing and has had nothing to say.</p>\n<p>If it be true that if, on the other hand, the master had rejoined the ship before any one else had taken possession, or had got it back from the salvors before the cargo-owners had been heard from, he might have had a right to complete the voyage, the ground must be that the law would not insist on a technical breach of condition when there had been no substantial change of circumstances and no harm done.</p>\n<p>The argument on the other side consists largely in the attempt to treat leaving the ship under stress of perils of the sea as not distinguishable on principle from being torn bodily away from it by tempest. This is one of the oldest fallacies of the law. The difference between the two is the difference between an act and no act. The distinction is well settled in the parallel instance of duress by threats, as distinguished from overmastering physical force applied to a man's body and imparting to it the motion sought to be attributed to him. In the former case <span class=\"star-pagination\">*131</span> there is a choice and therefore an act, no less when the motive commonly is recognized as very strong or even generally overpowering, than when it is one which would affect the particular person only, and not the public at large. It has been held on this ground that duress created by fear of immediate death did not excuse a trespass. <i>Gilbert</i> v. <i>Stone,</i> Aleyn, 35; <i>S.C.</i> Style, 72; <i>Scott</i> v. <i>Shepherd,</i> 2 W. Bl. 892, 894. See <i>Miller</i> v. <i>Horton,</i> 152 Massachusetts, 540, 547. It has been held that a similar plea in the case of shipwrecked men at sea did not prevent the killing of one of them from being murder. <i>Queen</i> v. <i>Dudley,</i> 14 Q.B.D. 273. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Holmes,</i> 1 Wall. Jr. 1. It is clear that a contract induced by such fear is voidable only, not void, and that the ground of avoidance being like fraud, that the party has been subjected to an improper motive for action, when that motive has been created by a stranger and is unknown to the party the contract stands. Keilwey, 154a, pl. 3. <i>Fairbanks</i> v. <i>Snow,</i> 145 Massachusetts, 153. So a conveyance induced by duress is operative until avoided and cannot be set aside when the property has passed to a purchaser without notice. <i>Bainbrigge</i> v. <i>Browne,</i> 18 Ch. D. 188, 197; 2 Williams, Vendor &amp; Purch. 767; <i>Clark</i> v. <i>Pease,</i> 41 N.H. 414. The distinction is as old as the Roman law, <i>Tamen coactus volui.</i> D. 4. 2. 21 § 5. 1 Windscheid, Pandekten, § 80.</p>\n<p>The same principles which apply to the making of a contract apply to the breach of it and to non-performance of the conditions attached to performance on the other side. The contract before us by construction provides that an abandonment of the voyage in consequence of the perils of the sea shall not be an actionable breach, but it equally provides that a completion of the voyage shall be an absolute condition to the right to freight. The same absoluteness attaches the further condition implied from the first that the effort to complete the voyage shall not be given up voluntarily, midway.</p>\n<p>The argument urged to the effect that the cargo's liability to general average created a right to have the voyage finished, however it might have been otherwise, does not need an extended <span class=\"star-pagination\">*132</span> answer. The cargo-owners had the same right to treat the contract as ended as against a ship-owner who had cut down a mast that they would have had against one who had made no sacrifice for the common good. The contract is the supreme source of mutual rights, and cannot be overridden by the incidents of its performance.</p>\n<p>The case was brought here by the cargo-owners to get rid, if possible, of the personal liability imposed by the Circuit Court. As this court is of opinion that the personal liability should not have been imposed, no other question needs consideration here.</p>\n<p><i>Decree reversed.</i></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BROWN, with whom were MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, MR. JUSTICE McKENNA and MR. JUSTICE DAY, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Underlying all the questions connected with the libel of Ward &amp; Co. for the possession of the cargo, and that of Andreasen in the nature of a cross libel against the cargo <i>in rem,</i> and against Ward &amp; Co. <i>in personam</i> for freight, is the proposition that the abandonment of the vessel by the master and crew operated as a dissolution of the contract of affreightment and authorized Ward &amp; Co. to reclaim possession of the cargo, either freed altogether from any claim for freight, or upon the payment of a <i>pro rata</i> freight to Boston.</p>\n<p>The general principles applicable to a contract of affreightment are entirely well settled, but it may not be amiss to restate such of them as bear upon the effect of an abandonment at sea, and subsequent rescue of the vessel. The contract is an entire one, and cannot be apportioned, unless by consent of the parties. <i>The Nathaniel Hooper,</i> 3 Sumner, 542, 554; <i>Hunter</i> v. <i>Prinsep,</i> 10 East, 378, 394; <i>Post</i> v. <i>Robertson,</i> 1 Johns. 24, 26. From the moment the cargo is delivered to the vessel, each is bound to the other for the performance of the contract. The shipper cannot recover his cargo except upon the payment of full freight. <i>Tindall</i> v. <i>Taylor,</i> 4 Ellis &amp; Bl. 219. Neither can the vessel demand any portion of the freight until the cargo is delivered at the port <span class=\"star-pagination\">*133</span> of destination. If the vessel meet with disaster at sea and put into a port of refuge, she is entitled to retain the cargo for a reasonable time for repairs, or to trans-ship it to another vessel, in order that her freight may be earned. <i>The Soblomsten,</i> L.R. 1 Ad. &amp; Ec. 293; 1 Pars. on Ship. 175, 231; <i>Cargo ex Galam,</i> Br. &amp; L. 167, 178. If, however, the master of the vessel is willing to surrender the cargo at an intermediate port, and the shipper is willing to receive it, he may do so upon payment of a <i>pro rata</i> freight. In other words, the parties may substitute a new contract for the original one. Neither party, however, can be compelled to this course. <i>Post</i> v. <i>Robertson,</i> 1 Johns. 24, 27.</p>\n<p>If it be once granted that, in case of shipwreck or other disaster, the contract of affreightment is not dissolved, and the authorities on this question, both in this country and in England, settle this beyond controversy, <i>Cargo ex Galam,</i> Br. &amp; L. 167; <i>Shipton</i> v. <i>Thornton,</i> 9 Ad. &amp; Ellis, 314, it is difficult to see why, on principle, a compulsory abandonment at sea should work a different result, provided the vessel be ultimately rescued and taken into port. The abandonment is but a feature of the disaster, and is no abandonment at all of the ship and cargo in the sense in which that word is used in the law of marine insurance, where a vessel after such disaster is abandoned to the underwriters. <i>Thornely</i> v. <i>Hebson,</i> 2 B. &amp; Ald. 513, 519. In such case the abandonment is a voluntary and complete surrender of the ship and cargo, and of all right, title and interest thereto, and the underwriter becomes the owner with all the rights and liabilities incident to such ownership. It is true it has been held that the underwriter may decline to accept such abandonment and may repair the vessel and return it to the owner, but that does not change the character of the abandonment.</p>\n<p>The same may be said of the throwing overboard of portions of a cargo of perishable articles, on account of rottenness, putrescence or threatened danger to the rest of the cargo. But the case under consideration is more nearly analogous to the jettison of valuable cargo for the purpose of relieving the ship or preventing her from drifting ashore. This has never been <span class=\"star-pagination\">*134</span> supposed to work any change in the ownership or an abandonment of the property, although it may subject it to the claim of salvors, who may subsequently rescue it. <i>The Kathleen,</i> L.R. 4 Ad. &amp; Ec. 269, 278. The abandonment of the ship and cargo in this case did not operate as a transfer of the property to any one who should rescue it, but was an involuntary abandonment of the voyage, a relinquishment of any present intention to continue it, and a flight from the vessel to save the lives of the crew, and for the purpose of obtaining a supply of fresh water. If the abandonment have the effect claimed for it, of dissolving the contract of affreightment, logically it would have that effect from the moment the master and crew were transferred to the schooner which took them off; but it will not be doubted that, if within an hour, a steam tug had hove in sight and offered to take the abandoned vessel in tow, the rights of the master and owner would have remained unimpaired, except for the claim for salvage. In our view it would make no difference whether the master had hired a steam tug to tow her to a place of safety, or whether, after the master and crew had left her, a vessel had come along, picked her up and towed or navigated her to a harbor of refuge. Granting that the master and crew left her with no intention of returning, such intention was caused by the belief on his part that she was a total loss. But if the circumstances were so changed that she did not become such, we see no reason why he was not entitled to change his mind in that particular, provided that he acted with sufficient promptness, and intervening rights had not accrued.</p>\n<p>The facts of this case show that as soon as the master learned of the rescue of the vessel he went to Boston, arriving September 21, two days after the barque, went aboard the vessel, announced his intention of completing the voyage, and, the day after the libel for salvage was filed, interposed a claim for ship and cargo, in which he alleged that he was entitled to the possession of the cargo of hard pine lumber then on board of her, having given bills of lading for it, and being obliged by the terms of such bills of lading to deliver said cargo at Montevideo <span class=\"star-pagination\">*135</span> in the province of Uruguay. There was manifestly no lack of diligence here, although the agents of Ward &amp; Co. filed a claim to the cargo later on the same day, and on October 18 filed a libel for possession and moved for a sale of the cargo. The question was thus squarely presented as to which of these parties was entitled to the cargo, which was manifestly dependent upon the other question, whether the contract of affreightment was still in existence. That there was no definite intention of abandoning the lien of the ship upon the cargo is shown by the fact that as soon as the master was informed that the vessel had been rescued he took immediate steps to recover possession of the cargo.</p>\n<p>The American cases upon the effect of abandonment of a vessel at sea upon the contract of affreightment are not of any great value, as the subject is not fully discussed in any of them and the question was not presented in the aspect in which it is before us in this case. In the <i>Elizabeth and Jane,</i> 1 Ware, 41, the petition was for wages, which were denied upon the ground that the vessel had been abandoned and no freight had been earned. The case of <i>The Nathaniel Hooper,</i> 3 Sumner, 542, is still more indefinite in its treatment of the subject herein involved. So, in the case of <i>Dunnett</i> v. <i>Tomhagen,</i> 3 Johnson, 154, wages were denied to the seamen, because no freight was earned on the homeward voyage, no part of the cargo being delivered by the ship.</p>\n<p>In <i>Post</i> v. <i>Robertson,</i> 1 Johns. 24, the vessel was abandoned after performing three-fourths of her homeward voyage, was rescued by salvors and brought into port, where the cargo was sold, and the proceeds paid to the salvors and owners. It was held that this was not such a delivery of the cargo as would entitle the ship-owners to maintain an action on the charter party for full freight. The case turned largely upon the form of action, covenant, and the court was inclined to the opinion that an action might have lain for a <i>quantum meruit.</i></p>\n<p>In none of these cases was the question discussed as to the power of the master to reclaim possession of the cargo at the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*136</span> port of refuge in order to earn his freight, it being seemingly assumed that the wreck and abandonment of the vessel had dissolved all contracts, and especially that of the seamen, who attempted to enforce their lien upon the cargo before freight had been earned by its delivery at the port of destination.</p>\n<p>It may be frankly admitted that the English cases lay down the rule that the abandonment of the vessel puts an end to the contract of affreightment, or at least it gives the owner of the cargo an option to do so. The case of <i>The Kathleen,</i> L.R. 4 Ad. &amp; Ec. 269, is the earliest upon the subject, and asserts a principle which has been followed in the subsequent English cases. The Kathleen had left Charleston with a cargo of cotton bound for Bremen, and when in the English Channel suffered a collision with another vessel, for which the Kathleen was in nowise to blame. On the following day she was abandoned by her crew and rescued by salvors, taken to Dover and sued for salvage. The owner of the Kathleen applied for leave to bond the cargo in the salvage suits in order that they might carry the same to its destination. The court ordered the cargo sold on the ground that it was deteriorating fast through the damage sustained by salt water. A suit for freight was subsequently instituted by the owners of the vessel. Sir Robert Phillimore held that the original contract between the owners of the ship and cargo was at an end, and that no freight was due, and in answer to the claim of <i>pro rata</i> freight observed that the title to such <i>pro rata</i> freight must arise out of a new contract with the ship-owner, to which both parties assent, and as neither party assented, <i>pro rata</i> freight was not due. In view of the fact that at least seven-eighths of the voyage had been performed; that the collision which put an end to the voyage was not in anywise the fault of the Kathleen; that she was taken into a port in the immediate neighborhood, and that the vessel stood ready to take the cargo on to Bremen and earn her freight, we are not favorably impressed with the natural justice of a decision which denied even <i>pro rata</i> freight to the master.</p>\n<p>The case of <i>The Cito,</i> 7 P.D. 5, was much like that of <i>The</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*137</span> <i>Kathleen,</i> which was followed by the Court of Appeals in an opinion by Lord Justice Brett, subsequently Lord Esher. The Cito, on a voyage from Wilmington to Rotterdam, with a cargo of resin in barrels, was, owing to the peril of the sea, abandoned by her crew off the American coast. She was subsequently picked up and navigated to Plymouth, and there arrested for salvage. The court declined to hold that a mere abandonment at sea put an end to a contract of affreightment, since the abandonment might be wrongful, and in such a case the owner of the cargo might sue the ship upon its contract; but it held that the abandonment was so far binding upon the ship-owner as to allow the cargo-owner to treat such contract as abandoned. The court also held that the court below was right in ordering the cargo to be delivered to the owners upon their giving bail for salvage. Some stress was laid upon the fact that before the ship-owners sought the possession of the cargo, the cargo-owners had intervened and applied for it.</p>\n<p>In the case of <i>The Leptir,</i> 5 Asp. M.L.C. 411, the salving vessel took off the crew of the vessel in distress, refused to allow her own crew to return, and the two vessels were navigated into a port of refuge. It was held that there was no abandonment, that the case of <i>The Cito</i> did not apply, and the court decreed for a <i>pro rata</i> freight.</p>\n<p>In <i>The Argonaut,</i> unreported, but published in the Shipping Gazette of December 5, 1884, a vessel on a voyage from Halifax to Liverpool was abandoned by her crew and picked up by salvors off the English coast. On being taken to Plymouth the owners demanded the cargo, but the court ordered it carried to Liverpool, where it obtained a higher price than the owner could have gotten for it at Plymouth. It seems to have been carried in the ship by her own crew from Plymouth to Liverpool. The Admiralty Court allowed a <i>quantum meruit</i> freight, but its decree was reversed by the Court of Appeals, which held that the ship was entitled to nothing.</p>\n<p>The prior cases were, however, pushed to their logical conclusion in that of <i>The Arno,</i> decided by the Court of Appeals, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*138</span> 8 Asp. M.L.C. 5. The vessel, while on a voyage from New York to Liverpool, was, owing to stress of weather, abandoned at sea on March 31, and three days thereafter was picked up by a salvage crew, and taken to Liverpool, her port of destination. The Admiralty Court held that, although the cargo was delivered by the vessel on which it had been originally shipped, at the port of destination, the act of abandoning her so clearly indicated the intention of the master not to carry out the contract, as to entitle the owners of the cargo to treat that act as putting an end to it. It was held that no freight was recoverable. It appeared that on April 11, as soon as the owner of the Arno heard of the abandonment, he made an arrangement with the salvors, sent a tug to meet the vessel, which returned with her to Liverpool on April 25. It was intimated that if, before notice to the ship-owner of the election of the cargo-owner to treat the contract as at an end, he had been able to resume possession of the ship and cargo, he might perhaps have been able to annul the abandonment, but not having done so, the cargo-owner had a right to treat the abandonment as a dissolution of the contract. The judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. It is true that in this case the cargo was not delivered at the port of destination by the crew of the ship, but by the salvor's crew. It was, however, delivered by the ship herself, and we see no reason why the salvor's crew might not have been treated as the agent of the ship, in that particular; but the court held to the hard and fast rule of <i>The Cito,</i> that the abandonment of a ship <i>ipso facto</i> put an end to the contract of affreightment, notwithstanding the fact that the cargo was delivered by the same ship and at the port of destination. Under such circumstances the denial of all freight seems to have worked a great-hardship.</p>\n<p>Although the House of Lords has not yet spoken upon the subject, these cases must be regarded as settling the English rule that a compulsory abandonment of a vessel at sea puts an end to the contract of affreightment and disentitles her owners to recover any portion of her freight, notwithstanding that she <span class=\"star-pagination\">*139</span> and her cargo may be picked up by salvors and taken into an intermediate port, or even to the port of discharge.</p>\n<p>That the soundness of this doctrine has not been accepted without challenge is evident, not only from certain expressions by some of the English writers, but notably by Dr. Wendt, in his work on Maritime Legislation, wherein he speaks of <i>The Cito</i> as having caused much surprise among those interested in maritime commerce, and comments upon it as follows (3d edition, page 629):</p>\n<p>\"So long as this <i>Cito</i> decision stands it gives the cargo owner the full option to take advantage of the common misfortune for the purpose of evading the contract entered into by him. This, I confidently assert, is opposed to every principle of law and justice. A contract, by the law of every civilized country, holds good until both parties to it, of their own free will, agree that it shall not be carried out. Now, how can the abandonment of a ship in such a case as <i>The Cito</i> be taken to be an expression of an agreement on the part of the owners of the vessel to cancel the contract? The action of the crew in leaving a vessel to save their lives is not an act of will at all; they have to desert their vessel under the pressure of a <i>vis major.</i> How can this be taken to show an agreement on the part of the ship owner to abandon his part of the contract? He has no power to exercise any option at all. If, when the vessel is recovered and the owner again requires [acquires?] the power to exercise his will in the matter, he then elects not to carry out his contract, and the cargo owner agrees, well and good; the contract is put an end to by mutual consent. To assume, however, such consent on the part of one of the contracting parties from an action forced on his servants by a power which cannot be resisted seems to me to be a doctrine utterly opposed to common sense.\"</p>\n<p>The ruling of the English courts that even a delivery of the cargo at the port of destination does not entitle the ship-owners to any freight whatever, seems a somewhat startling innovation upon the ancient rule of the Admiralty, that a loss occasioned <span class=\"star-pagination\">*140</span> by a peril of the sea shall be borne as a common burden and shared proportionately by the ship, cargo and freight, as well as a departure from the general rule that neither party can put an end to a contract without the assent of the other.</p>\n<p>We consider the sounder doctrine to be that the compulsory abandonment of a ship at sea should be treated merely as a relinquishment of the voyage and of any present intention to continue it, but that if the vessel be subsequently rescued and taken into an intermediate port, the master retains the same right given to him by an ordinary disaster at sea, unattended by an abandonment, to resume possession of the ship and cargo, subject, of course, to the claim of salvors, and carry the latter forward to its destination, provided he act with promptness and before any intervening rights had accrued.</p>\n<p>The opinion of the court assumes that the abandonment of the vessel was a repudiation and a rescission of the contract of affreightment, when in fact it was involuntary, designed only to save the lives of the crew, and had as little effect upon the contract as if the vessel had met with a disaster not involving an abandonment and put into a port of safety for repairs. It apparently ignores the principle that, to constitute a rescission, there must be the same intent to rescind as there was originally to contract, and that the intent to rescind should not be inferred without some act which points unmistakably to that conclusion. There is no more reason for holding that the abandonment of the ship was a rescission of the contract of affreightment than that such abandonment was a renunciation of all the owner's title to the ship in case she were subsequently rescued. Whether, if Ward &amp; Company had insisted upon the ship carrying out her contract they might, in case of refusal, have had a cause of action, it is unnecessary to consider. It view of the severity of the storm, and of the danger of remaining on board, the effect of her abandonment on the contract probably never entered the mind of the master. Such abandonment was not a failure to perform the contract in any particular, since it was the result of an overwhelming necessity, and if the vessel were <span class=\"star-pagination\">*141</span> rescued the master might repair and continue the voyage, or trans-ship the cargo to another vessel after the extent of the damage had been ascertained. He might indeed have supposed that the ship was irretrievably lost, but both parties took the chance of its being rescued and taken to a port of safety, when the question would then arise whether prudence required her to be repaired, or the cargo trans-shipped.</p>\n<p>In such case the same question arises as if the ship had met with a disaster, and been navigated into a port by her own crew. We think it makes no difference in principle whether a tug is hired by the master to take his ship into port, or a tug in the employment of another person comes along and picks her up. If the cargo-owner had himself rescued the vessel he might doubtless have declared the contract rescinded, but it is quite otherwise if the vessel be rescued by her own master and crew, or be taken in tow by a third party.</p>\n<p>Applying the doctrine of the opinion, it would follow (and such are the English cases of <i>The Kathleen</i> and <i>The Arno</i>) that if the vessel be abandoned near her port of destination and towed into such port by a salving tug, she loses her whole freight and cannot even recover on a <i>quantum meruit,</i> though the whole voyage be performed.</p>\n<p>This conclusion seems so irreconcilable with natural justice that we are constrained to dissent.</p>\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "<div>\n<center><b><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></span> (1895)</b></center>\n<center><h1>THE ELIZA LINES.</h1></center>\n<center>No. 12.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Argued April 11, 12, 13, 1905.</center>\n<center>Decided October 30, 1895.</center>\nCERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT.\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*120</span> <i>Mr. L.S.

The decree in that court was made in a cause in which were consolidated four suits: A libel for salvage against the Eliza Lines, her cargo and freight; a libel for possession by the cargo-owners against the cargo; a libel by the master against cargo and cargo-owners for freight and general average, and a libel by a bottomry lender against the vessel and freight. The Eliza Lines, a Norwegian bark, was bound on a voyage from Pensacola to Montevideo with a cargo of lumber, under a charter party, \"the dangers of the seas, fire and navigation always mutually excepted.\" It was abandoned, justifiably, in consequence of dangers of the seas, and was afterwards picked up by salvors and brought into Boston on September 19, 1889. The master was notified by the owners and came on from St. John, New Brunswick, arriving on September 21. The cargo-owners <span class=\"star-pagination\">*126</span> (Ward &amp; Co.) and the master both demanded possession of the cargo from the salvors, but the salvors retained possession and filed their libel for salvage on September 26. The next day the master filed a claim for ship and cargo and within an hour Ward &amp; Co. filed their claim for the cargo as above mentioned. On October 5 the vessel was delivered to the master, and on October 18 the master moved for a delivery of the cargo to him upon stipulation in order to resume his voyage, while Ward &amp; Co. moved that the cargo be sold on the ground that its value was rapidly diminishing by reason of charges and costs. The former motion was denied and the latter granted on November 16. On November 27 the master filed his libel for freight and general average. The Circuit Court, reversing the decision of the District Court, held that the master should have been allowed to complete the voyage and earn freight, and charged the cargo-owners personally with the net freight that would have been earned, with other particulars not necessary to mention. 61 Fed. Rep. 308; 102 Fed. Rep. 184. The decree was affirmed with a slight variation by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 114 Fed. Rep. 307.</p>\n<p>The question is whether the abandonment of the vessel by the master and crew gave the cargo-owners a right to refuse to go on with the voyage in the circumstances disclosed; in other words, whether the cargo-owners properly were treated as guilty of a breach of contract for preventing the continuance of the voyage by their refusal and by procuring a sale. It will be noticed that the decree must stand on the ground that the contract was broken by the cargo-owners and that the ship-owners were entitled to recover under it, although the voyage was not completed. The decree was not upon a new contract such as it was attempted to set up in <i>Hopper</i> v. <i>Burness,</i> 1 C.P.D. 137, or upon the analogy of a <i>quantum meruit</i> at common law, which was expressly disavowed. The very foundation of a recovery upon the latter ground is that the express contract is out of the way, but that a benefit has been received which ought to be paid for. Therefore, in such a case the recovery cannot exceed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> the benefit, as often has been explained in the books. <i>Gillis</i> v. <i>Cobe,</i> 177 Massachusetts, 584; Keener, Quasi-Contracts, Ch. 4. See <i>Flaherty</i> v. <i>Doane,</i> 1 Lowell, 148, 150. In the case at bar, while the District Court allowed freight pro rata as a charge on the proceeds of the cargo, the Circuit Court of Appeals held the cargo-owners personally for a sum much exceeding that amount, and therefore much exceeding the benefit actually received. It will not be necessary to consider the decree of the District Court, since that was not appealed from by the cargo-owners, and we shall not discuss the effect of the judicial sale, as it is not necessary in the view which we take.</p>\n<p>There is not doubt that the English decisions confidently assert the cargo-owners' right to refuse to go on. They may be read in the reports, and there is no need to do more than to refer to them. <i>The Arno,</i> 8 Asp. Mar. Cas. 5; <i>The Leptir,</i> 5 Asp. Mar. Cas. 411; <i>The Argonaut,</i> Shipping Gazette, Weekly Summary, Dec. 5, 1884, p. 775; <i>The Cito,</i> 7 P.D. 5; <i>The Kathleen,</i> L.R. 4 Ad. &amp; Ec. 269. The only point which they leave open is whether, if the master should get the abandoned vessel and cargo back from the salvors before the cargo-owners had declared an election to end the contract, he might in that way revive his right to finish the voyage. On that point it is enough to say here that if the English rule is right, then, even if there is any such qualification to it, the exception must depend upon something more substantial than a few minutes' priority in filing a libel, when neither master nor cargo-owner has possession either of cargo or ship, as, plainly, neither had in this case.</p>\n<p>The right of cargo-owners to treat the contract as ended by the abandonment of the ship was asserted much earlier than the English cases by Judge Ware in <i>The Elizabeth and Jane,</i> 1 Ware, 41, <i>S.C.</i> 15 Fed. Cas. 478, Case No. 8321, and earlier still by Mr. Story before he became a justice of this Court, in his edition of Abbott on Shipping (1810), pp. 338, 512, citing <i>Dunnett</i> v. <i>Tomhagen,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Johns.</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></span>, and <i>Mason</i> v. <i>Ship Blaireau,</i> 2 Cranch, 240. We see nothing in <i>The Nathaniel Hooper,</i> 3 Sumner, 542, sufficient <span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> to prove that he changed his opinion. That case is cited in 3 Kent Comm., 13th ed. 228, along with <i>Post</i> v. <i>Robertson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Johns.</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></span>, in which and in <i>Dunnett</i> v. <i>Tomhagen, supra</i><i>,</i> the Supreme Court of New York and Chief Justice Kent took the same general view, subject to the question whether there might be a recovery on a <i>quantum meruit</i> when benefits were accepted under the contract, in spite of a failure of complete performance. See <i>Caze</i> v. <i>Baltimore Ins. Co.,</i> 7 Cranch, 358, 362. 3 Kent Comm. 229. Other cases are <i>The Mansanito,</i> 22 Fed. Cas. 594, No. 13,075. <i>The James Martin,</i> 88 Fed. Rep. 649. See also 3 Kent Comm. 196. In short, we are aware of no decision in this country or in England before the present case which casts any doubt upon the rule.</p>\n<p>It was thought by the Circuit Court and Circuit Court of Appeals that the doctrine so unanimously sanctioned by so many of the most eminent judges of this country and of England is unjust, and the case was put of a long voyage nearly completed and the ship and cargo subsequently brought by salvors intact to the port of destination. But we are of opinion that there is no injustice in holding that what excuses the ship excuses the cargo, and that the rule is in accord with the general principles of contract. Subject to the question whether the cargo-owners broke their contract, it seems to us more unjust to charge them personally, in favor of those who failed to complete the voyage as contemplated, with a sum much exceeding the benefit which the cargo-owners received from what was done. Of course it is desirable, if there is no injustice, that the maritime law of this country and of England should agree.</p>\n<p>To begin at a distance, a repudiation of a contract, amounting to a breach, warrants the other party in going no further in performance on his side. <i>Roehm</i> v. <i>Horst,</i> 178 U.S. 1. But the same thing is true of an absolute repudiation not amounting to a breach. <i>Frost</i> v. <i>Knight,</i> L.R. 7 Ex. 111, 113; <i>Phillpotts</i> v. <i>Evans,</i> 5 M. &amp; W. 475, 477; <i>Ballou</i> v. <i>Billings,</i> 136 Massachusetts, 307, 309.</p>\n<p>It appears to us and we shall try to prove that an abandonment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> of the ship must be regarded as a renunciation of the contract, even if not a repudiation of its terms as binding. It is an overt act which is more than an attempt to give up the voyage. It not merely makes the completion of the voyage so improbable, by reason of the helplessness in which the ship is left and the intent with which the act is done, as practically to destroy the value of the contract to the cargo-owner, see <i>Swift and Company</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></span>, 396, it is a present failure to do what the contract requires, if the purposes of the contract are to be carried out. The requirement is shown by the fact that the abandonment would be a cause of action unless justified. It not only would be a breach of contract but no one questions that it would authorize a rescission of the contract on the other side, which not every breach of contract does. That it would authorize rescission or refusal to allow the master to change his mind if the vessel was saved shows that a continuous intent and effort to go on with the voyage is an essential condition to the obligation to pay freight. It shows, what needs no illustration, that the continuous care of the master is the main object of the cargo-owners' interest in the contract. By the general principles of contract an open cessation of performance with the intent to do no more, even if justified, excuses the other party from further performance on his side. The principle is not peculiar to charter parties, it is illustrated in other parts of the law. See <i>Roehm</i> v. <i>Horst,</i> 178 U.S. 1.</p>\n<p>In the case at bar the vessel was abandoned with the intent not to return to her or to complete the voyage. This is admitted, if admission be necessary, by the testimony of the master. Of course it is not disputed that the completion of the voyage and delivery of the cargo are absolute conditions to the undertaking to pay freight, by the express terms of the contract and the familiar rule of law. 3 Kent Comm. 220, 228. The master left ship and cargo to their fate, and we cannot doubt, although it was denied, that, after he had done so, if the cargo-owners had been the salvors they could have treated the voyage as at an end. The ground must be that the abandonment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> was more than an attempt, or a mere offer of rescission which might be revoked by the master before acceptance, and that it was an unequivocal departure from the conditions which the contract imposed. If the abandonment had been unjustified and a breach of contract, of course it would not have ended the contract, but would have left the choice whether to end it or not to the cargo-owner. If justified, the simplest view would be that it was so because the contract authorized the master to end it when prevented from performance by perils of the sea, and that the contract was ended. But at all events, as control of the ship and voyage was given up and never regained, the abandonment at least gave an irrevocable power to the cargo-owners to decline to be further bound. See, in addition to cases cited above, 3 Kent Comm. 196. The opposite view must be that the master still is bound to go on with the voyage notwithstanding his justifiable abandonment, if a chance should turn up, a view which leaves his duties in a very ambiguous shape, or else that the master has the choice, which gives the election to the party whose act has made the trouble, as against the party that has done nothing and has had nothing to say.</p>\n<p>If it be true that if, on the other hand, the master had rejoined the ship before any one else had taken possession, or had got it back from the salvors before the cargo-owners had been heard from, he might have had a right to complete the voyage, the ground must be that the law would not insist on a technical breach of condition when there had been no substantial change of circumstances and no harm done.</p>\n<p>The argument on the other side consists largely in the attempt to treat leaving the ship under stress of perils of the sea as not distinguishable on principle from being torn bodily away from it by tempest. This is one of the oldest fallacies of the law. The difference between the two is the difference between an act and no act. The distinction is well settled in the parallel instance of duress by threats, as distinguished from overmastering physical force applied to a man's body and imparting to it the motion sought to be attributed to him. In the former case <span class=\"star-pagination\">*131</span> there is a choice and therefore an act, no less when the motive commonly is recognized as very strong or even generally overpowering, than when it is one which would affect the particular person only, and not the public at large. It has been held on this ground that duress created by fear of immediate death did not excuse a trespass. <i>Gilbert</i> v. <i>Stone,</i> Aleyn, 35; <i>S.C.</i> Style, 72; <i>Scott</i> v. <i>Shepherd,</i> 2 W. Bl. 892, 894. See <i>Miller</i> v. <i>Horton,</i> 152 Massachusetts, 540, 547. It has been held that a similar plea in the case of shipwrecked men at sea did not prevent the killing of one of them from being murder. <i>Queen</i> v. <i>Dudley,</i> 14 Q.B.D. 273. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Holmes,</i> 1 Wall. Jr. 1. It is clear that a contract induced by such fear is voidable only, not void, and that the ground of avoidance being like fraud, that the party has been subjected to an improper motive for action, when that motive has been created by a stranger and is unknown to the party the contract stands. Keilwey, 154a, pl. 3. <i>Fairbanks</i> v. <i>Snow,</i> 145 Massachusetts, 153. So a conveyance induced by duress is operative until avoided and cannot be set aside when the property has passed to a purchaser without notice. <i>Bainbrigge</i> v. <i>Browne,</i> 18 Ch. D. 188, 197; 2 Williams, Vendor &amp; Purch. 767; <i>Clark</i> v. <i>Pease,</i> 41 N.H. 414. The distinction is as old as the Roman law, <i>Tamen coactus volui.</i> D. 4. 2. 21 § 5. 1 Windscheid, Pandekten, § 80.</p>\n<p>The same principles which apply to the making of a contract apply to the breach of it and to non-performance of the conditions attached to performance on the other side. The contract before us by construction provides that an abandonment of the voyage in consequence of the perils of the sea shall not be an actionable breach, but it equally provides that a completion of the voyage shall be an absolute condition to the right to freight. The same absoluteness attaches the further condition implied from the first that the effort to complete the voyage shall not be given up voluntarily, midway.</p>\n<p>The argument urged to the effect that the cargo's liability to general average created a right to have the voyage finished, however it might have been otherwise, does not need an extended <span class=\"star-pagination\">*132</span> answer. The cargo-owners had the same right to treat the contract as ended as against a ship-owner who had cut down a mast that they would have had against one who had made no sacrifice for the common good. The contract is the supreme source of mutual rights, and cannot be overridden by the incidents of its performance.</p>\n<p>The case was brought here by the cargo-owners to get rid, if possible, of the personal liability imposed by the Circuit Court. As this court is of opinion that the personal liability should not have been imposed, no other question needs consideration here.</p>\n<p><i>Decree reversed.</i></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BROWN, with whom were MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, MR. JUSTICE McKENNA and MR. JUSTICE DAY, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Underlying all the questions connected with the libel of Ward &amp; Co. for the possession of the cargo, and that of Andreasen in the nature of a cross libel against the cargo <i>in rem,</i> and against Ward &amp; Co. <i>in personam</i> for freight, is the proposition that the abandonment of the vessel by the master and crew operated as a dissolution of the contract of affreightment and authorized Ward &amp; Co. to reclaim possession of the cargo, either freed altogether from any claim for freight, or upon the payment of a <i>pro rata</i> freight to Boston.</p>\n<p>The general principles applicable to a contract of affreightment are entirely well settled, but it may not be amiss to restate such of them as bear upon the effect of an abandonment at sea, and subsequent rescue of the vessel. The contract is an entire one, and cannot be apportioned, unless by consent of the parties. <i>The Nathaniel Hooper,</i> 3 Sumner, 542, 554; <i>Hunter</i> v. <i>Prinsep,</i> 10 East, 378, 394; <i>Post</i> v. <i>Robertson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Johns.</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></span>, 26. From the moment the cargo is delivered to the vessel, each is bound to the other for the performance of the contract. The shipper cannot recover his cargo except upon the payment of full freight. <i>Tindall</i> v. <i>Taylor,</i> 4 Ellis &amp; Bl. 219. Neither can the vessel demand any portion of the freight until the cargo is delivered at the port <span class=\"star-pagination\">*133</span> of destination. If the vessel meet with disaster at sea and put into a port of refuge, she is entitled to retain the cargo for a reasonable time for repairs, or to trans-ship it to another vessel, in order that her freight may be earned. <i>The Soblomsten,</i> L.R. 1 Ad. &amp; Ec. 293; 1 Pars. on Ship. 175, 231; <i>Cargo ex Galam,</i> Br. &amp; L. 167, 178. If, however, the master of the vessel is willing to surrender the cargo at an intermediate port, and the shipper is willing to receive it, he may do so upon payment of a <i>pro rata</i> freight. In other words, the parties may substitute a new contract for the original one. Neither party, however, can be compelled to this course. <i>Post</i> v. <i>Robertson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Johns.</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></span>, 27.</p>\n<p>If it be once granted that, in case of shipwreck or other disaster, the contract of affreightment is not dissolved, and the authorities on this question, both in this country and in England, settle this beyond controversy, <i>Cargo ex Galam,</i> Br. &amp; L. 167; <i>Shipton</i> v. <i>Thornton,</i> 9 Ad. &amp; Ellis, 314, it is difficult to see why, on principle, a compulsory abandonment at sea should work a different result, provided the vessel be ultimately rescued and taken into port. The abandonment is but a feature of the disaster, and is no abandonment at all of the ship and cargo in the sense in which that word is used in the law of marine insurance, where a vessel after such disaster is abandoned to the underwriters. <i>Thornely</i> v. <i>Hebson,</i> 2 B. &amp; Ald. 513, 519. In such case the abandonment is a voluntary and complete surrender of the ship and cargo, and of all right, title and interest thereto, and the underwriter becomes the owner with all the rights and liabilities incident to such ownership. It is true it has been held that the underwriter may decline to accept such abandonment and may repair the vessel and return it to the owner, but that does not change the character of the abandonment.</p>\n<p>The same may be said of the throwing overboard of portions of a cargo of perishable articles, on account of rottenness, putrescence or threatened danger to the rest of the cargo. But the case under consideration is more nearly analogous to the jettison of valuable cargo for the purpose of relieving the ship or preventing her from drifting ashore. This has never been <span class=\"star-pagination\">*134</span> supposed to work any change in the ownership or an abandonment of the property, although it may subject it to the claim of salvors, who may subsequently rescue it. <i>The Kathleen,</i> L.R. 4 Ad. &amp; Ec. 269, 278. The abandonment of the ship and cargo in this case did not operate as a transfer of the property to any one who should rescue it, but was an involuntary abandonment of the voyage, a relinquishment of any present intention to continue it, and a flight from the vessel to save the lives of the crew, and for the purpose of obtaining a supply of fresh water. If the abandonment have the effect claimed for it, of dissolving the contract of affreightment, logically it would have that effect from the moment the master and crew were transferred to the schooner which took them off; but it will not be doubted that, if within an hour, a steam tug had hove in sight and offered to take the abandoned vessel in tow, the rights of the master and owner would have remained unimpaired, except for the claim for salvage. In our view it would make no difference whether the master had hired a steam tug to tow her to a place of safety, or whether, after the master and crew had left her, a vessel had come along, picked her up and towed or navigated her to a harbor of refuge. Granting that the master and crew left her with no intention of returning, such intention was caused by the belief on his part that she was a total loss. But if the circumstances were so changed that she did not become such, we see no reason why he was not entitled to change his mind in that particular, provided that he acted with sufficient promptness, and intervening rights had not accrued.</p>\n<p>The facts of this case show that as soon as the master learned of the rescue of the vessel he went to Boston, arriving September 21, two days after the barque, went aboard the vessel, announced his intention of completing the voyage, and, the day after the libel for salvage was filed, interposed a claim for ship and cargo, in which he alleged that he was entitled to the possession of the cargo of hard pine lumber then on board of her, having given bills of lading for it, and being obliged by the terms of such bills of lading to deliver said cargo at Montevideo <span class=\"star-pagination\">*135</span> in the province of Uruguay. There was manifestly no lack of diligence here, although the agents of Ward &amp; Co. filed a claim to the cargo later on the same day, and on October 18 filed a libel for possession and moved for a sale of the cargo. The question was thus squarely presented as to which of these parties was entitled to the cargo, which was manifestly dependent upon the other question, whether the contract of affreightment was still in existence. That there was no definite intention of abandoning the lien of the ship upon the cargo is shown by the fact that as soon as the master was informed that the vessel had been rescued he took immediate steps to recover possession of the cargo.</p>\n<p>The American cases upon the effect of abandonment of a vessel at sea upon the contract of affreightment are not of any great value, as the subject is not fully discussed in any of them and the question was not presented in the aspect in which it is before us in this case. In the <i>Elizabeth and Jane,</i> 1 Ware, 41, the petition was for wages, which were denied upon the ground that the vessel had been abandoned and no freight had been earned. The case of <i>The Nathaniel Hooper,</i> 3 Sumner, 542, is still more indefinite in its treatment of the subject herein involved. So, in the case of <i>Dunnett</i> v. <i>Tomhagen,</i> 3 Johnson, 154, wages were denied to the seamen, because no freight was earned on the homeward voyage, no part of the cargo being delivered by the ship.</p>\n<p>In <i>Post</i> v. <i>Robertson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Johns.</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></span>, the vessel was abandoned after performing three-fourths of her homeward voyage, was rescued by salvors and brought into port, where the cargo was sold, and the proceeds paid to the salvors and owners. It was held that this was not such a delivery of the cargo as would entitle the ship-owners to maintain an action on the charter party for full freight. The case turned largely upon the form of action, covenant, and the court was inclined to the opinion that an action might have lain for a <i>quantum meruit.</i></p>\n<p>In none of these cases was the question discussed as to the power of the master to reclaim possession of the cargo at the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*136</span> port of refuge in order to earn his freight, it being seemingly assumed that the wreck and abandonment of the vessel had dissolved all contracts, and especially that of the seamen, who attempted to enforce their lien upon the cargo before freight had been earned by its delivery at the port of destination.</p>\n<p>It may be frankly admitted that the English cases lay down the rule that the abandonment of the vessel puts an end to the contract of affreightment, or at least it gives the owner of the cargo an option to do so. The case of <i>The Kathleen,</i> L.R. 4 Ad. &amp; Ec. 269, is the earliest upon the subject, and asserts a principle which has been followed in the subsequent English cases. The Kathleen had left Charleston with a cargo of cotton bound for Bremen, and when in the English Channel suffered a collision with another vessel, for which the Kathleen was in nowise to blame. On the following day she was abandoned by her crew and rescued by salvors, taken to Dover and sued for salvage. The owner of the Kathleen applied for leave to bond the cargo in the salvage suits in order that they might carry the same to its destination. The court ordered the cargo sold on the ground that it was deteriorating fast through the damage sustained by salt water. A suit for freight was subsequently instituted by the owners of the vessel. Sir Robert Phillimore held that the original contract between the owners of the ship and cargo was at an end, and that no freight was due, and in answer to the claim of <i>pro rata</i> freight observed that the title to such <i>pro rata</i> freight must arise out of a new contract with the ship-owner, to which both parties assent, and as neither party assented, <i>pro rata</i> freight was not due. In view of the fact that at least seven-eighths of the voyage had been performed; that the collision which put an end to the voyage was not in anywise the fault of the Kathleen; that she was taken into a port in the immediate neighborhood, and that the vessel stood ready to take the cargo on to Bremen and earn her freight, we are not favorably impressed with the natural justice of a decision which denied even <i>pro rata</i> freight to the master.</p>\n<p>The case of <i>The Cito,</i> 7 P.D. 5, was much like that of <i>The</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*137</span> <i>Kathleen,</i> which was followed by the Court of Appeals in an opinion by Lord Justice Brett, subsequently Lord Esher. The Cito, on a voyage from Wilmington to Rotterdam, with a cargo of resin in barrels, was, owing to the peril of the sea, abandoned by her crew off the American coast. She was subsequently picked up and navigated to Plymouth, and there arrested for salvage. The court declined to hold that a mere abandonment at sea put an end to a contract of affreightment, since the abandonment might be wrongful, and in such a case the owner of the cargo might sue the ship upon its contract; but it held that the abandonment was so far binding upon the ship-owner as to allow the cargo-owner to treat such contract as abandoned. The court also held that the court below was right in ordering the cargo to be delivered to the owners upon their giving bail for salvage. Some stress was laid upon the fact that before the ship-owners sought the possession of the cargo, the cargo-owners had intervened and applied for it.</p>\n<p>In the case of <i>The Leptir,</i> 5 Asp. M.L.C. 411, the salving vessel took off the crew of the vessel in distress, refused to allow her own crew to return, and the two vessels were navigated into a port of refuge. It was held that there was no abandonment, that the case of <i>The Cito</i> did not apply, and the court decreed for a <i>pro rata</i> freight.</p>\n<p>In <i>The Argonaut,</i> unreported, but published in the Shipping Gazette of December 5, 1884, a vessel on a voyage from Halifax to Liverpool was abandoned by her crew and picked up by salvors off the English coast. On being taken to Plymouth the owners demanded the cargo, but the court ordered it carried to Liverpool, where it obtained a higher price than the owner could have gotten for it at Plymouth. It seems to have been carried in the ship by her own crew from Plymouth to Liverpool. The Admiralty Court allowed a <i>quantum meruit</i> freight, but its decree was reversed by the Court of Appeals, which held that the ship was entitled to nothing.</p>\n<p>The prior cases were, however, pushed to their logical conclusion in that of <i>The Arno,</i> decided by the Court of Appeals, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*138</span> 8 Asp. M.L.C. 5. The vessel, while on a voyage from New York to Liverpool, was, owing to stress of weather, abandoned at sea on March 31, and three days thereafter was picked up by a salvage crew, and taken to Liverpool, her port of destination. The Admiralty Court held that, although the cargo was delivered by the vessel on which it had been originally shipped, at the port of destination, the act of abandoning her so clearly indicated the intention of the master not to carry out the contract, as to entitle the owners of the cargo to treat that act as putting an end to it. It was held that no freight was recoverable. It appeared that on April 11, as soon as the owner of the Arno heard of the abandonment, he made an arrangement with the salvors, sent a tug to meet the vessel, which returned with her to Liverpool on April 25. It was intimated that if, before notice to the ship-owner of the election of the cargo-owner to treat the contract as at an end, he had been able to resume possession of the ship and cargo, he might perhaps have been able to annul the abandonment, but not having done so, the cargo-owner had a right to treat the abandonment as a dissolution of the contract. The judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. It is true that in this case the cargo was not delivered at the port of destination by the crew of the ship, but by the salvor's crew. It was, however, delivered by the ship herself, and we see no reason why the salvor's crew might not have been treated as the agent of the ship, in that particular; but the court held to the hard and fast rule of <i>The Cito,</i> that the abandonment of a ship <i>ipso facto</i> put an end to the contract of affreightment, notwithstanding the fact that the cargo was delivered by the same ship and at the port of destination. Under such circumstances the denial of all freight seems to have worked a great-hardship.</p>\n<p>Although the House of Lords has not yet spoken upon the subject, these cases must be regarded as settling the English rule that a compulsory abandonment of a vessel at sea puts an end to the contract of affreightment and disentitles her owners to recover any portion of her freight, notwithstanding that she <span class=\"star-pagination\">*139</span> and her cargo may be picked up by salvors and taken into an intermediate port, or even to the port of discharge.</p>\n<p>That the soundness of this doctrine has not been accepted without challenge is evident, not only from certain expressions by some of the English writers, but notably by Dr. Wendt, in his work on Maritime Legislation, wherein he speaks of <i>The Cito</i> as having caused much surprise among those interested in maritime commerce, and comments upon it as follows (3d edition, page 629):</p>\n<p>\"So long as this <i>Cito</i> decision stands it gives the cargo owner the full option to take advantage of the common misfortune for the purpose of evading the contract entered into by him. This, I confidently assert, is opposed to every principle of law and justice. A contract, by the law of every civilized country, holds good until both parties to it, of their own free will, agree that it shall not be carried out. Now, how can the abandonment of a ship in such a case as <i>The Cito</i> be taken to be an expression of an agreement on the part of the owners of the vessel to cancel the contract? The action of the crew in leaving a vessel to save their lives is not an act of will at all; they have to desert their vessel under the pressure of a <i>vis major.</i> How can this be taken to show an agreement on the part of the ship owner to abandon his part of the contract? He has no power to exercise any option at all. If, when the vessel is recovered and the owner again requires [acquires?] the power to exercise his will in the matter, he then elects not to carry out his contract, and the cargo owner agrees, well and good; the contract is put an end to by mutual consent. To assume, however, such consent on the part of one of the contracting parties from an action forced on his servants by a power which cannot be resisted seems to me to be a doctrine utterly opposed to common sense.\"</p>\n<p>The ruling of the English courts that even a delivery of the cargo at the port of destination does not entitle the ship-owners to any freight whatever, seems a somewhat startling innovation upon the ancient rule of the Admiralty, that a loss occasioned <span class=\"star-pagination\">*140</span> by a peril of the sea shall be borne as a common burden and shared proportionately by the ship, cargo and freight, as well as a departure from the general rule that neither party can put an end to a contract without the assent of the other.</p>\n<p>We consider the sounder doctrine to be that the compulsory abandonment of a ship at sea should be treated merely as a relinquishment of the voyage and of any present intention to continue it, but that if the vessel be subsequently rescued and taken into an intermediate port, the master retains the same right given to him by an ordinary disaster at sea, unattended by an abandonment, to resume possession of the ship and cargo, subject, of course, to the claim of salvors, and carry the latter forward to its destination, provided he act with promptness and before any intervening rights had accrued.</p>\n<p>The opinion of the court assumes that the abandonment of the vessel was a repudiation and a rescission of the contract of affreightment, when in fact it was involuntary, designed only to save the lives of the crew, and had as little effect upon the contract as if the vessel had met with a disaster not involving an abandonment and put into a port of safety for repairs. It apparently ignores the principle that, to constitute a rescission, there must be the same intent to rescind as there was originally to contract, and that the intent to rescind should not be inferred without some act which points unmistakably to that conclusion. There is no more reason for holding that the abandonment of the ship was a rescission of the contract of affreightment than that such abandonment was a renunciation of all the owner's title to the ship in case she were subsequently rescued. Whether, if Ward &amp; Company had insisted upon the ship carrying out her contract they might, in case of refusal, have had a cause of action, it is unnecessary to consider. It view of the severity of the storm, and of the danger of remaining on board, the effect of her abandonment on the contract probably never entered the mind of the master. Such abandonment was not a failure to perform the contract in any particular, since it was the result of an overwhelming necessity, and if the vessel were <span class=\"star-pagination\">*141</span> rescued the master might repair and continue the voyage, or trans-ship the cargo to another vessel after the extent of the damage had been ascertained. He might indeed have supposed that the ship was irretrievably lost, but both parties took the chance of its being rescued and taken to a port of safety, when the question would then arise whether prudence required her to be repaired, or the cargo trans-shipped.</p>\n<p>In such case the same question arises as if the ship had met with a disaster, and been navigated into a port by her own crew. We think it makes no difference in principle whether a tug is hired by the master to take his ship into port, or a tug in the employment of another person comes along and picks her up. If the cargo-owner had himself rescued the vessel he might doubtless have declared the contract rescinded, but it is quite otherwise if the vessel be rescued by her own master and crew, or be taken in tow by a third party.</p>\n<p>Applying the doctrine of the opinion, it would follow (and such are the English cases of <i>The Kathleen</i> and <i>The Arno</i>) that if the vessel be abandoned near her port of destination and towed into such port by a salving tug, she loses her whole freight and cannot even recover on a <i>quantum meruit,</i> though the whole voyage be performed.</p>\n<p>This conclusion seems so irreconcilable with natural justice that we are constrained to dissent.</p>\n</div>", "id": 94255, "judges": "Shiras, After Stating the Case", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/94255/", "sha1": "6b978cddf1e3fe2b87939b5ffce1f198b4ca6187", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:22:10"}
