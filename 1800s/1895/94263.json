Upon the hearing of this question, Secretary Lamar said: 'The certification by the governor under this act was not made without an effort on the part of the railroad to prevent it. He was enjoined by the company, but the injunction was dissolved, and the certification followed. The company is still opposing reassertion of title by the United States, and is now here, by its president any by counsel, claiming, in effect, that the grant for the benefit of the company was one of quantity, and not lands in place; and that, therefore, the company has earned the lands in question, notwithstanding they are outside of the fifty-mile terminal limits.' The conclusion of the secretary is thus stated: 'I must conclude, after a careful examination of the matter as presented, that neither the state of Iowa nor the Sioux City and St. Paul Railroad Company ever had any title under the granting act of 1864 to the lands in question beyond the prima facie legal title which would appear from the face of the patents, which, so far as these lands are concerned, were improperly and illegally issued. This title, such as it was, had gone no further than the state, for it had not patented or certified the lands in question to the company. The state having relinquished and reconveyed to the United States such title as it had, I have no hesitation in concurring in your recommendation that the lands so certified and conveyed be restored to entry under the settlement laws of the United States. You will therefore treat them as public lands, and they will be thrown open to settlement and entry, as are other public lands of the United States.' 6 Dec. Dep.
