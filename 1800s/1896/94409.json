To this petition the defendants interposed a demurrer upon the ground that the petition did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, which was sustained and the petition dismissed, whereupon the case was carried to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, the judgment reversed and the case remanded. <i>Hornsby</i> v. <i>Eddy,</i> 12 U.S. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*589</span> App. 404.

Hornsby against them as set forth in the intervening petition of said Hornsby and the issues joined thereon to a master,\" was overruled. A jury was then empanelled on motion of the intervenor, a trial had, and verdict returned, whereupon the court entered an order in these words, after setting out the verdict:</p>\n<p>\"And thereupon the court doth now approve said verdict and order and adjudge that the said intervenor, John E.
