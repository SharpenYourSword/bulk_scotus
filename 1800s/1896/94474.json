Brady have appealed to the supreme court of the United States from the decree lately rendered in the circuit court of the United States for the Southern district of New York, made in favor of you, the said Augustin Daly, which decree was affirmed by the United States circuit court of appeals, and the said George P. Webster and William A. Brady have appealed to the said supreme court of the United States from the order and mandate directing an affirmance of the said decree, and from the decree entered in accordance with the said order and mandate, and filed the security required by law.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These papers, together with an assignment of error, were filed in the circuit court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, and on August 9, 1893, the record was certified by the clerk of the circuit court, under the seal thereof, 'to contain a true and complete transcript of the record and proceedings had in said court in the case of Augustin Daly, Complainant and Appellee, against George P. Webster and William A. Brady, Defendants and Appellants, as the same remains of record and on file in said office.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This record embraces the pleadings, evidence, master's report, orders, decrees, and proceedings in the circuit court, and the two mandates from the circuit court of appeals, and necessarily does not contain the proceedings in, and judgments of, the latter court. It does not appear, and is not contended, that that court ever entered any order allowing an appeal, or that any application and allowance were ever filed therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record was filed in this court August 13, 1893, and the cause docketed as an appeal from the circuit court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The result of all this clearly is that the pending appeal is not an appeal from the circuit court of appeals, and is an appeal from the circuit court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But under the fifth section of the judiciary act of March 3, 1891, appeals will not lie directly to this court, except in cases falling within one or the other of the classes of cases therein enumerated, and the case before us is not one of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the sixth section, appeals may be taken from the circuit court of appeals to this court in all cases in which the judgments and decrees of that court are not therein made final, where the matter in controversy exceeds $1,000, besides costs, and copyright cases are such cases. But this is not an appeal from the circuit court of appeals. Our appellate jurisdiction is defined by that act, and we cannot maintain jurisdiction to review the judgments and decrees of the circuit courts, except as therein prescribed. It does not help the matter that the circuit courts may, by the form of their entries, make the judgments and decrees of the circuit courts of appeals their judgments and decrees. We cannot revise the judgments and decrees of the appellate tribunals, except when brought before us by appeal therefrom, writ of error thereto, or by certiorari.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice BREWER and Mr. Justice PECKHAM did not hear the argument, and took no part in the decision of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
