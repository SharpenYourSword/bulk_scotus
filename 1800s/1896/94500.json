On April 18, 1895, he was found guilty under the second count of the indictment, which alleged that on April 6, 1893, he was assis ant postmaster at Thornton, in the county of Limestone, within the district aforesaid, and as such assistant postmaster had in his possession and control money-order funds to the amount of $400, and did unlawfully and feloniously embezzle and convert the same to his own use. He was sentenced to imprisonment in the penitentiary, and thereupon he applied for and obtained a writ of error from this court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the trial the defendant entered a plea of misnomer, as follows:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'And now comes W. J. Foust, in his proper person, who is indicted by the name of W. J. Faust, and having heard the said indictment read, says that he was baptized in the name of W. J. Foust, and by that name always since his baptism hereto has been called and known, and by no other name has he ever been known or called, and this he, the said W. J. Foust, is ready to verify. Wherefore he prays judgment of the said indictment, and that the same may be quashed.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court overruled this plea, and the defendant took an exception. At the suggestion of the attorney for the United States the defendant was requested to suggest his true and proper name, in order that it might be inserted in the indictment, and entered on the docket. This the defendant declined to do.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Exceptions were also taken by the defendant to the rejection of certain evidence offered on his behalf, and to the admission of certain evidence introduced by the government, and to the court's refusal to charge the jury as the defendant requested, and to certain portions of the charge which were given.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

J. Faust, whose Christian name was to the grand jurors unknown. There was filed a plea of misnomer, in which the defendant averred that he had been baptized in the name of W. J. Foust, and that he had always been known and called by that name, and prayed that the indictment might be quashed. This plea was overruled, as was likewise a motion to quash the indictment on the ground that defendant's name was W. J. Foust, and not W. J.

A name need not be correctly spelled in an indictment, if substantially the same sound is preserved.

E. Foust, postmaster at Thornton, Tex., from October 10, 1891, to May 20, 1893, showing balance due of $744.18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was objected to, because said transcript did not purport to be a transcript from the money-order account books of the post-office department of the account of W.

This evidence was properly rejected as irrelevant and immaterial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fourth assignment complains of the refusal of the trial court to permit a witness who had been examined and cross-examined to be recalled in order to make some change in the statements made by him on cross-examination.

It was claimed that, as the indictment failed to charge that the defendant embezzled any momey without the consent of his principal or employer, and as the postmaster, J. E.
