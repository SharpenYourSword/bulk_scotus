It is understood and agreed that said Exposition Company shall have the right to furnish copies for publication to the newspaper press of the world, and copies for free distribution if desired, and also may publish same in the official history of the dedicatory ceremonies: and, subject to the concession herein made, the author expressly reserves her copyright therein.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff testified that portions of the ode consisted of lyrical songs intended to be set to music and sung by the chorus, and that the rest was to be read; that a musical composer was engaged to write the music for the portions to be sung, and she gave him permission to publish those portions, because it was necessary for rehearsals by the chorus, and they were published in connection with the music; but that she never, before the dedication day, gave any permission for the publication or public use of any other part of the poem.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff also testified that in May, 1892, she applied to the librarian of congress for a copyright of the ode, and deposited with him a copy of its title only, and on October 22d, the day after the dedicatory ceremonies, and not be fore, deposited with him two copies of the ode.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of the whole evidence, the defendant moved the court to direct a verdict for the defendant, upon the grounds that the plaintiff had failed to show title to the ode; that she had disposed of her rights of property in the ode to the World's Columbian Exposition; that, in view of the contemplated publication in the newspapers, there could be no valid retention of any copyright; that any newspaper publication was an infringement of the rights of the Exposition, and not of the plaintiff; and that the only reservation in the contract between her and the Exposition was of her copyright, and, in view of the fact that no copyright was taken out until after October 21st, there had been no infringement of her copyright; and upon the further grounds 'that the plaintiff has failed to make out a cause of action, in that this is an action founded upon a statute which authorizes the maintaining of an action for damages occasioned to the plaintiff, and, in view of the fact that there is no evidence in this case of the plaintiff's having suffered damage, no cause of action has been made out'; and 'that the statutes and constitution of the United States have taken away the commonlaw right, and all remedies, except under the statutes of the United States.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court overruled this motion, as well as a subsequent motion to instruct the jury accordingly, and instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The action is not an action of libel. It is an action to recover damages for the alleged violation of the plaintiff's copyright in her unpublished manuscript ode. It is an action for an injury to property.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Copyright is of two kinds. The first is the common-law right of an author or proprietor of an unpublished manuscript to the possession and control of his or her manuscript, and to direct and control the circulation of the copies which he or she may make or cause to be made for his or her use, prior to the publication thereof. It is the original ownership of the manuscript, and of the copies which the author or proprietor has made for his or her use, before it is given to the public. Statutory copyright is the exclusive right granted by statute to the owner or proprietor of a printed book or other printed publication to publish, print, and sell copies of the book or publication, for a specific period of time. If the statutory formalities have been complied with, the right becomes complete upon the publication of the book.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'This case is not one of statutory copyright. While some of the preliminaries to the establishment of such a right had been taken, the right was not complete, and on September 24, 1892, did not exist. On that day a copy of the unpublished manuscript came into the possession of the defendant. It had not then been published, although typewritten copies had been made for the examination and use of the musical composer, and for the examination of the committee whose duty it was to approve the work. This circulation of copies did not amount to what the law calls 'publication.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The exclusive owner or proprietor of an unpublished manuscript has the exclusive right to its possession, and to direct and control its use,&#8212;the same right which the owner of any other article of personal property has to its ownership and use. The trespasser upon that right is liable in damages.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court further instructed the jury that the Exposition, by the terms of its contract with the plaintiff, 'had the legal right to distribute copies to the newspaper press, and for free publication, before as well as after the day of dedication'; but that, 'subject to those concessions, the author reserved her other rights of copyright therein'; and that the plaintiff, upon the evidence in the case, might recover exemplary damages against the defendant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant excepted to the instructions given, and to the refusal to instruct as requested. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $5,000, and judgment was rendered thereon, which was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals. 38 U. S. App. 410, 19 C. C. A. 429, and 73 Fed. 196. The defendant thereupon sued out the present writ of error, and a motion was now made to dismiss it for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John M. Bowers, for plaintiff in error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Geo. H. Yeaman and Henry S. Monroe, for defendant in error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice GRAY, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of suits of a civil nature, at law or in equity, the circuit courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, by reason of the citizenship of the parties, in cases between citizens of different states, or between citizens of a state and aliens; and, by reason of the cause of action, 'in cases arising under the constitution or laws of the United States, or treaties made or which shall be made under their authority,' including, of course, suits arising under the patent or copyright laws of the United States.
