Then follows the writ of error. Then comes what is termed a decree in the case of George Fowler v. The Cherokee Brilliant Coal &amp; Mining Company and others, in the superior court of Cook county, Ill., which decree, after reciting the fact of a hearing, and a reference to a master in chancery, and his report thereon, proceeds to make certain findings of fact, and to give extracts from the constitution and statutes of Kansas, which, briefly stated, are as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) The incorporation of the coal and mining company under the statutes of Kansas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) An extract from the constitution and statutes of Kansas providing for a double liability of stockholders of an insolvent corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) An extract from the statutes of Kansas providing for the dissolution of corporations, and for a recovery against the stockholders therein for debts due from the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) An extract from the statutes of limitation of Kansas relating to absconding or concealed debtors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) Findings of indebtedness from the coal and mining company to the Fowlers, plaintiffs in error, the giving of a note and mortgage for such indebtedness, and default in the payment thereof, and a dissolution of the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(6) The recovery of judgment in Illinois in favor of the plaintiffs in error herein on account of the debt due them from the corporation.

Then follows an assignment of errors committed by the court in ordering such reversal, after which the opinion of Judge Wilkin, of the supreme court of Illinois, is printed, which affirms the judgment of the appellate court. 34 N. E. 932. In that opinion no federal question is discussed or decided. The point actually decided by the supreme court of Illinois was, as shown by that opinion, that the constitution and statutes of Kansas in relation to the liability of stockholders in an insolvent corporation provide a special remedy for enforcing forcing that liability, and that such remedy only could be pursued, and that the courts of Illinois would not enforce a statutory liability under a Kansas statute providing a special remedy against stockholders. Following this opinion is a decree of affirmance by the supreme court of Illinois, after which comes a petition for a writ of error from this court and an allowance thereof.

Thus, there is an entire absence in this whole record of any fact showing that the supreme court of Illinois, or either of the lower courts, decided any federal question whatever. The assignment of errors alleged to have been made by the Illinois supreme court is unavailable for the purpose of showing any federal question decided, where the record itself does not show that any such question was passed upon by the state court.
