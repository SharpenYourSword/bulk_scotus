Beyond the language of this finding they call our attention to the opinion in which, after a reference to the peculiar circumstances of this case, the court observes: \"The court has no reason in this particular case, other than the lapse of time and the inaction of the claimant, to discredit the witnesses or suspect the claim.\" We cannot so interpret the finding or the opinion. We do not understand that either lays down any arbitrary rule of evidence, as, for instance, that a claim ten years old must be proved by at least two witnesses, one twenty years old by three witnesses, and so on. Such action would be legislative rather than judicial. The court simply refers, and properly, to the age of the claim, the failure to present it for such a length of time and the meagreness of the testimony now offered to substantiate it, and then finds that such testimony, as to two essential facts in the claimant's case, to wit, the extent of the depredation and the amount of the loss, is not sufficient. It is true the court does not find that the witnesses have sworn falsely, but that is not essential even when that is its belief. To say that the testimony is not satisfactory is more polite and less offensive, and at the same time equally sufficient.

A traverse having been filed, the case was submitted to the court upon the evidence. Certain findings of fact were made, the second of which is as follows:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The depredation was committed on the 17th November, 1867, near the town of Ft. Collins, in Larimer county, Colo., by the defendant Indians. The claimant never presented this claim to the department of the interior, nor to congress, nor to any officer or agent of the government, until his petition in this case was filed in this court on the 16th April, 1891. It is supported only by the testimony of the claimant himself and one witness. Since the claimant testified, he has filed his own ex parte affidavit, stating that the witness above referred to 'is the only person with whom I am acquainted who is familiar with the theft complained of,' and that, of 13 persons who followed the Indians at the time they took his horses, he does not know the whereabouts of any except the witness produced, and that he had used every endeavor to discover the other witnesses, but can secure no information except that they are dead. The court is not satisfied, by this evidence, as to the extent of the depredation or the value of the property.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon this finding judgment was entered in favor of the defendants (29 Ct. Cl. 111), from which judgment the claimant appealed to this court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Charles A. Kiegwin and J. M. Wilson, for appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Asst. Atty. Gen. Howry, for appellees.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice BREWER, after stating the facts in the foregoing language, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The findings of the court of claims in an action at law determine all matters of fact, precisely as the verdict of a jury. 24 Stat. 505, &#167;&#167; 2, 7; 26 Stat. 851, &#167;&#167; 1, 4; Desmare v.
