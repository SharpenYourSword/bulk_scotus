The record having been remitted by the Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court of the State, the writ of error was directed to the latter tribunal.</p>\n<p>The correctness of the ruling of the Court of Appeals, upholding the validity of the statute referred to, was vigorously attacked in argument, emphasis being laid on the fact that three judges dissented from the opinion of the court, two of whom (Judges Gray and Bartlett) delivered opinions.</p>\n<p>We are unable, however, to pass upon the question pressed upon our notice as to whether the statute referred to is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, for the reason that the Court of Appeals of the State of New York is composed of a chief judge and several associate judges, and the writ of error in this case was allowed and the citation signed by an associate judge, who did not purport to act as chief judge or chief judge <i>pro tem.</i> of the court. The signature to the allowance of the writ was as follows: \"Edward T. Bartlett, Asso. Judge, N.Y. Court of Appeals;\" while following the signature to the citation was the designation: \"Asso.

True it is, that there is contained in the record, at the end thereof, an affidavit verified by counsel for plaintiff in error on July 29, 1896, stating that the deponent was informed and believed that the chief judge of the Court of Appeals was then abroad in Europe and would be for some space of time to come, while the writ of error was allowed and the citation signed on the 6th of August following. The affidavit purports to have been filed with the papers in the case in the Supreme Court of New <span class=\"star-pagination\">*410</span> York on September 2, 1896. It manifestly, however, in no particular justifies the inference that the associate justice who allowed the writ was, at the time of such allowance, the chief judge <i>pro tem.</i> of the Court of Appeals. It was essential, in order to confer jurisdiction on this court, that the chief judge of the Court of Appeals of New York or his lawful substitute or a Justice of this court should have allowed the writ and signed the citation.</p>\n<p>Thus, it is provided in the Revised Statutes as follows:</p>\n<p>\"SEC. 999.

It was construed in <i>Bartemeyer</i> v. <i>Iowa,</i> 14 Wall. 26, where the court, taking notice <i>sua sponte</i> of the fact that there had been no proper allowance of a writ of error, said (p. 27):</p>\n<p>\"Writs of error to the state court can only issue when one of the questions mentioned in the 25th section of that act was decided by the court to which the writ is directed, and in order that there may be some security that such a question was decided in the case, the statute requires that the citation must be signed by the Chief Justice or judge or chancellor of the court rendering or passing the judgment or decree complained of, or by a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
