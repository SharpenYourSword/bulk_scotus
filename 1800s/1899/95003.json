Defendant excepted to the jurisdiction, because the petition contained no averment that the suit could have been maintained 'by the assignors of the claims or certificates sued upon.' The circuit court overruled the exception, and the cause subsequently went to judgment. 92 Fed. 695.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the eleventh section of the judiciary act of 1789 it was expressly provided that the circuit courts could not take cognizance of a suit to recover the contents of any promissory note or other chose in action in favor of an assignee, unless a suit might have been prosecuted in such court to recover the said contents, if no assignment had been, except in cases of foreign bills of exchange. The act of March 3, 1875 (18 Stat. 470, c. 137), provided: 'Nor shall any circuit or district court have cognizance of any suit founded on contract in favor of an assignee, unless a suit might have been prosecuted in such court to recover thereon if no assignment had been made, except in cases of promissory notes negotiable by the law merchant and bills of exchange.' The restriction was thus removed as to 'promissory notes negotiable by the law merchant,' and jurisdiction in such suits made to depend on the citizenship of the parties, as in other cases.

They were transferable by delivery. They were not negotiable under the law merchant, but that was immaterial. They were payable to any person holding them in good faith, not by virtue of any assignment of the promise, but by an original and direct promise, moving from the maker to the bearer. Thompson v. Perrine, 106 U. S. 589, 1 Sup. Ct. 564, 568. They were therefore not subject to the restriction, and the circuit court had jurisdiction. In New Orleans v. Benjamin, 153 U. S. 411, 14 Sup.
