In other words, a new manufacture is usually accompanied by a change of name, but a change of name does not always indicate a new manufacture.

It is much like the commercial division of lumber into \"selects, common and culls,\" which are all lumber, but of different qualities.

It is true that the lumber in question was in a condition to be used for flooring without further manufacture, except such reductions in length as the dimensions of the room might require; but it was also usable for ceiling, sheathing and for similar purposes with no further alterations.

The collector imposed a duty of 25 per cent. upon this lumber, as a 'manufacture of wood,' under paragraph 181 of the tariff act of August 28, 1894, which reads as follows (28 Stat. 521): 'House or cabinet furniture, of wood, wholly or partly finished, manufactures of wood or of which wood is the component material of chief value, not specially provided for in this act, twenty-five per centum ad valorem.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The importer protested, claiming that they should have been imported free of duty, as 'dressed lumber,' under paragraph 676.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The board of general appraisers sustained the action of the collector, and the importer filed this petition for review in the circuit court, which reversed the decision of the board. On appeal by the United States to the circuit court of appeals (24 C. C. A. 449, 79 Fed. 75), where the cause was heard by two judges, who were divided in opinion, the judgment of the circuit court was affirmed.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whereupon the United States applied for, and were granted, a writ of certiorari from this court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Asst.

They were prepared for use by what is known as a 'flooring machine,' which is a combination of a simple planing machine with a matching or tonguing and grooving machine.
