It, also, appeared, that Mr. <i>J. R.

That it was founded merely on the mistake, and misapprehension, of the agent, acting for two parties, having distinct interests, and giving separate powers. 2d. That, under such circumstances, a Court of equity can, and ought to, apportion the securities, by a fair division of them; so that each party may possess the entire interest and remedy in his proportion. 3d. That even if an apportionment could not be made, the Court will appoint a receiver, to collect and divide the joint fund, in the regular proportions.

That the point of law is clearly in favour of of the claim; and to set aside a plain rule of law, there must be strong, controuling, principles of equity, in favour of the opposite party. 2d. That the act of taking joint securities was not a mistake, or error; but a deliberate act for the accommodation of purchasors. 3d. That there was no suggestion of a fraud, a breach of trust, wilful <i>laches</i>, or probable insolvency, in reference to the surviving obligee. 4th. That there is, therefore, no foundation for the interposition of the Court to appoint a receiver; nor to justify a Court of equity in compelling the parties to accede to an arbitrary apportionment of the securities.
