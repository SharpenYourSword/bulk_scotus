The purpose was, \"to lay out townships in the county of Luzerne, by persons \"not appointed, or acknowledged, by the laws of this commonwealth.\" \"Now, the term township, indicates a local jurisdiction, for objects of local police, with powers and officers to effectuate the jurisdiction; and a conspiracy by individuals to erect such townships, is an encroachment upon the rights and authority of the state. It is an offence indictable at common law; and the legislature, with a view more effectually to prevent its commission, had an unquestionable power to increase the punishment.</p>\n<p>As to the first section of the act of assembly, I am not prepared to pronounce, that it is unconstitutional; and, consequently, I could not, even on that ground, decide, at present, to arrest the judgment. But it is enough to observe, that on the finding of the jury, I shall be ready to give judgment, for the commonwealth, on the second count of the indictment, when the subject is brought before us in the Circuit Court.<sup>[(1)]</sup></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[(1)]  The cause was argued, upon the other objections, in arrest of judgment, before the Supreme Court, in December Term 1804.
