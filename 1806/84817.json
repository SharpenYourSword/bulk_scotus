No final answer was made by the defendants to the demand, till the 19th of November; but the intermediate time was given to them to consider of the demand, and make propositions of compromise. No compromise being made, and the flour not being delivered, this action was commenced on the 21st of the same month. It did not appear that any answer was given to the plaintiff's demand. At the trial, the plaintiff offered evidence to the jury of the price of flour on the 19th and 21st days of November, the price being the same on both days, and contended to the jury only for that price. Whereupon, the counsel for the defendants prayed the court to instruct the jury, that in estimating the compensation for the non-delivery of the said flour, they should be governed by the price of the article on the day the plaintiff signified his option, and made his demand under the contract, to have the flour specifically delivered to him; and further prayed the court, in case the aforesaid instruction was not given, to direct the jury by what rule, in point of time, they are to take the price of flour, in the estimation of the damages sustained by the plaintiff, by reason of the breach of the contract. But the court being divided in opinion upon those points, (two judges only being present) did not give the instructions as prayed, wherefore the defendants excepted, &amp;c.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, for 2,159 dollars and 48 cents, upon which judgment was rendered accordingly, and the defendants brought their writ of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question before this court was, whether the court below ought to have given the instructions prayed for by the plaintiffs in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This question was submitted, without argument, by <i>Swann</i>, for the plaintiffs in error, and <i>E.
