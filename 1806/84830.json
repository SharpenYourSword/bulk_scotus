The defendants pleaded the general issue, and at the trial a verdict was taken for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court upon a demurrer to evidence, which stated, in substance, that the defendants signed and delivered the said note to M'Pherson&#8212;that he applied to the agent of the plaintiff for the corn, and offered three dollars a barrel, payable in twelve months that the agent consulted the plaintiff, who agreed that M'Pherson should have the corn on those terms, if he would give security that M'Pherson then offered as his security, Lawrason &amp; Smoot. The agent agreed to take them, if they would give their assumption in writing. In a few days afterwards, M'Pherson sent to the agent the said note of Lawrason &amp; Smoot. Before the corn was delivered, the agent informed the plaintiff what had passed between himself and M'Pherson, relative to the corn, and also showed him the note, and asked him whether it would do; to which he replied, he supposed it would. But they called upon Lawrason, and asked him if he was content to be M'Pherson's security for this corn. He hesitated at first, but said he <i>must be so</i>, as he had promised; or, as his word was out, <i>he would;</i> or words to that effect: whereupon the plaintiff suffered M'Pherson to take the corn, at the price of three dollars per barrel, which he agreed to give.

This is, therefore, a promise to the plaintiff, and a good consideration is raised by the delivery of the corn upon the faith of the defendant's note in writing.
