The words of the <i>Connecticut law, fol.</i> 35. are, 'absent or absconding <i>debtors</i>,' and the defendants are so called in the declaration.

And in the case of <i>Diggs and Keith</i> v. <i>Wolcott</i>, in this court, at last term, (<i>ante, p.</i> 179.) the appellants had removed the cause from the state court to the circuit court, who decreed against them, and on their appeal to this court the decree was reversed for want of jurisdiction in the circuit court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the court has a limited jurisdiction, the facts which bring the case within that jurisdiction must appear on the record. 9 <i>Mod.</i> 95. 3 <i>Dall.</i> 382. <i>Bingham</i> v. <i>Cabot</i>. 2 <i>Cranch, Wood</i> v. <i>Wagnon</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the demurrer to the plea to the jurisdiction, the whole record is open to examination; and the defendant may avail himself of every substantial objection to the declaration, or to the writ, as it is made a part of the record. The declaration itself shows that the lands which are the subject of the covenant are in the state of Virginia; that the deed was there executed; and that the title of those lands is drawn in question. It appears, then, upon the face of the declaration, that the action is local, and can be tried only in Virginia. The declaration also states Pollard and Pickett to be 'of the county of Henrico and state of Virginia,' and that they are 'absent and absconding debtors;' and therefore the circuit court was excluded from the cognizance of the case by the 11th section of the <i>judiciary act of</i> 1789, <i>vol.</i> 1. <i>p.</i> 55.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The declaration is also defective in not averring an eviction, or a better title out of the plaintiffs in error. 1 <i>Williams' Massachusetts Reports</i>, 464. <i>Emerson</i> v. <i>Property of Minot</i>. 4 <i>T.

The act of congress of March 3, 1803, (<i>vol.</i> 6. <i>p.</i> 315.) enacts 'that the circuit court of the second circuit shall <i>consist</i> of the justice of the supreme court residing within the third circuit, and the district judge of the district where such court shall be holden;' and by the act of 29th of April, 1802, <i>vol.</i> 6. <i>p.</i> 88. it is 'Provided, that when only one of the judges, hereby directed to hold the circuit courts, shall attend, such court may be held by the judge so attending.' The 5th section of the same act provides for the <i>allotment</i> of the judges among the circuits, in case of a new appointment of a judge; but makes no provision in case of a <i>vacancy</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There can be no circuit court in the second circuit, unless there be a justice of the supreme court allotted to that circuit.

The evidence offered was to show that the survey was fraudulent. It was to show that surveys, said to be made in eight days, could not have been made in eight weeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bill of exceptions states the papers to be <i>copies</i> of the surveys, and <i>ex vi termini</i>, a copy means a true copy; for if it be not a true copy, it is no copy. The objection was not that they were not copies, but that copies of such papers were not admissible evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testimony of Granger was to show that the land was included in prior surveys.

The case in <i>Williams' Reports</i> is upon a covenant to <i>warrant;</i> which is, in effect, a covenant for quiet enjoyment. So was the case in 1 <i>Mod.</i> 292. In the case from <i>Saunders</i>, the covenant was that he was <i>seised</i>. It is true that proof of eviction is one mode of showing a want of title, but it is not the only mode. In <i>Horsford</i> v. <i>Aggard, Kirby's Rep.</i> 3. it is decided that eviction is not necessary to recover on a covenant of seisin. If the plaintiff can show that the defendant had a defective title, it is sufficient. What use would there be in a covenant of seisin, in addition to the covenant of warranty, if the former requires the same evidence as the latter?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Martin</i>, in reply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the papers offered were copies, it does not appear that the originals could not be had.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Pollard and Pickett had produced a grant under the state of Virginia, the plaintiffs below must have shown a better title in some other person, (<i>Cro. Jac.</i> 304. <i>Salman</i> v. <i>Bagshaw</i>,) but they only attempted to prove irregularity in the survey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The patent gave a good title, even if there had been no survey. The surveyor himself could not have been permitted to contradict his certificate. It does not appear how long the surveyor was employed in making the survey. It could only bear date on <i>one</i> day, and whether that was the day on which he began or finished it, does not appear. It is no evidence of fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. <i>Martin</i> declined arguing the points respecting the jurisdiction and the form of the declaration, as the court seemed strongly inclined against him; but he thought it a fatal objection to the declaration that it did not aver an eviction; and that the action was local, and not transitory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\"><i>March</i> 15.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MARSHALL, Ch.

By appearing to the action, the defendants in the court below placed themselves precisely in the situation in which they would have stood, had process been served upon them, and consequently waived all objections to the non-service of process. Were it otherwise, the duty of the circuit court would have been to remand the cause to the state court in which it was instituted, and this court would be bound now to direct that proceeding. As little foundation is there for the exception taken to the manner in which the circuit court was constituted. That court consists of two judges, any one of whom is capable of performing judicial duties. So this court consists of seven judges, any four of whom may act. It has never been supposed that the death of three of the judges would disqualify the remaining four from discharging their official duties until the vacant seats of their departed brethren should be filled. There is nothing in the peculiar phraseology of that part of the judicial act which establishes the circuit courts, that requires a different construction of the words authorising a single judge to hold those courts, from what is usually given in other cases, to clauses authorising a specified number of justices to constitute a court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The exceptions taken to the proceedings of the circuit court are more serious.

This leads to the inquiry, whether the covenant of the vendors can be broken, as stated in the declaration, although no eviction has taken place; and the court is of opinion that it may be so broken. 9 <i>Co.</i> 60.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The covenant is, that the vendor is seised in fee of the premises which he sells and conveys. Suppose the fact to be that he had no title nor pretence of title to those premises; that he had conveyed lands for which he had never received a patent or a title of any kind. Could it be said that his covenant that he was seised in fee remained unbroken until the real proprietor should think proper to eject the vendee? This question, in the opinion of the court, must be answered in the negative.
