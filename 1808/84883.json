But the district judge rejected the plea, and ordered the claimant to answer <i>on oath:</i> whereupon the claimant offered the same denial on oath, by way of answer; to the receiving of which the attorney for the United States objected, unless the claimant would make oath to answer truly all interrogatories which might be put to him relative to the cause; but the judge overruled the objection, and received the answer, saying that the United States might except to the answer, in the same manner as to an answer in chancery; <i>or</i>, might reply, setting forth new facts not inconsistent with the libel, and put interrogatories thereupon, as upon the allegations in a bill in chancery, which, if proper and pertinent, must be answered; as was done in the case of <i>Maleu</i> v. <i>Shattuck</i>, (<i>ante, vol. 3. p.</i> 458.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The attorney for the United States filed a replication, and propounded interrogatories, which he prayed might be answered by the claimant <i>viva voce, in open court</i>.

But it is stated in the libel that the vessel was more than ten tons burthen, that the seizure was made in the <i>port of Alexandria</i>, and that the vessel had sailed from that port to the West-Indies, and back to Alexandria, from whence it necessarily follows, that the waters of the port of Alexandria are navigable from the sea by vessels of ten and more tons burthen.

Congress could not make cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; and under that clause of the constitution they could not give their courts jurisdiction of a case which was not of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction at the time of the adoption of that constitution. The question, then, is, whether, according to the understanding of the people of this country at that time, a seizure of a vessel, within the body of a county, for breach of a municipal law of trade, was a case of admiralty cognizance. It certainly was never so considered in England, from whence we draw all our ideas of admiralty jurisdiction. All seizures in that country for violation of the laws of revenue, trade, or navigation are tried by a jury in the court of exchequer according to the course of the common law. There is nothing in the course of proceedings <i>in rem</i> which requires that they should be in a court of admiralty. A court of common law is as competent to the trial of such cases as a court of admiralty. The high court of admiralty in England exercises no original jurisdiction in revenue cases. It hears only <i>appeals</i> in such cases from the vice-admiralty courts in the colonies, to whom the jurisdiction is given by an act of parliament. 2 <i>Browne, Civil Law</i>, 492. 2 <i>Rob.</i> 189. <i>The Sarah</i>. 4 <i>Inst.</i> 135. 139. 2 <i>Browne</i>, 75. 78. 3 <i>Bl.

It was one of our serious grievances, and of which we complained against Great Britain in our remonstrances to the King, and in our addresses to the people of Great Britain, while we were colonies, that the jurisdiction of the courts of vice-admiralty was extended to cases of revenue. <i>Journals of the old Congress, vol.</i> 1. <i>p.</i> 47. Such being the understanding of the people of this country at the adoption of the constitution, we are to presume that the words '<i>cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction</i>,' did not include cases of seizure like the present. The 9th section of the judiciary act (<i>vol.</i> 1. <i>p.</i> 53.) is to be construed with a reference to the meaning of those expressions in the constitution; and if it cannot, consistently with the force of its terms, be reconciled with the constitution, it must yield to the superior obligation of that instrument. The words of that section of the act, as far as they affect the present question, are, 'and shall also have exclusive original cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, <i>including</i> all seizures under laws of impost, navigation, or trade, of the United States, where the seizures are made on waters which are navigable from the sea by vessels of ten or more tons burthen, within their respective districts as well as upon the high seas: saving to suiters, <i>in all cases</i>, the right of a common law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it; and shall also have exclusive original cognizance of all seizures on land, or other waters than as aforesaid, made, and of all suits for penalties and forfeitures incurred under the laws of the United States.' 'And the trial of issues in fact in the district courts, in all causes, except civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, shall be by jury.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The word '<i>including</i>,' means only, <i>moreover</i>, or, <i>as well as</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court shall have exclusive original cognizance of <i>all</i> civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, <i>including</i>, within its exclusive original cognizance, all seizures, &amp;c. It does not mean <i>including within the expression</i> '<i>all civil causes of admiralty</i>,' &amp;c. If such cases of seizure were civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, there was no necessity to enumerate them, because the expression, <i>all</i> civil causes of admiralty, &amp;c. certainly included them. If they were not civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, congress could not make them such, nor by forcing them into that class, deprive the citizen of his right to a trial by jury. Congress had no such intention, for in the very same breath they say, 'saving to suiters, in all cases, the right of a common law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it.' We have seen that in all cases of seizure for breaches of the laws of revenue, trade or navigation, the common law is competent to give a remedy; and consequently this suiter is entitled to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The several acts of congress creating forfeitures for breaches of the laws of revenue, &amp;c. all seem to refer to the exchequer practice, rather than to that of the admiralty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the act for registering vessels, passed the 31st <i>of December</i>, 1792, (<i>Oswald's edition of the Acts of Congress, vol.</i> 2. <i>p.</i> 134. 144. <i>sect.</i> 4. <i>and</i> 16.) if the owner shall take a false oath, 'there shall be a forfeiture of the vessel, &amp;c. or of the value thereof, to be recovered <i>with costs of suit</i>,' of the person taking the false oath. So in case of the sale of a vessel to a foreigner it shall be forfeited in a certain case, 'provided that if it shall be made appear to <i>the jury</i> before whom the trial for such forfeiture shall be had, that,' &amp;c. and the penalties and <i>forfeitures</i>, under that act were to 'be <i>sued for, presecuted</i> and <i>recovered</i>,' in such courts, &amp;c. as penalties and forfeitures under the act for the collection of duties, &amp;c. Hence it is evident that congress intended that all cases of forfeiture should be tried by jury. The expressions in the act respecting registering of vessels, explain what may otherwise appear doubtful in the act concerning the collection of duties, as to the mode of prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So in the act suspending intercourse with France, <i>vol.</i> 1. <i>p.</i> 245. offending vessels are made liable to be seized, 'and may be prosecuted and condemned in any <i>circuit</i> or district court of the United States, which shall be holden within or for the district where the seizure shall be made.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But by the judiciary act no <i>circuit</i> court could take original cognizance of civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; hence it is obvious that congress did not consider such seizures as civil causes of admiralty, &amp;c. The forfeiture also is to accrue to any person 'who will <i>inform</i> and <i>prosecute</i> for the same,' which shows that the proceedings were to be at common law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All the forfeitures under the act for the collection of duties, are to be recovered in the same way. <i>Some</i> of them being cases of seizure on land, must be tried by jury, therefore <i>all</i> must. And in sect. 71. (<i>vol.</i> 4. <i>p.</i> 391.) it is said, 'in <i>actions, suits</i> or <i>informations</i> to be brought, where any seizure shall be made pursuant to this act, if the property be claimed by any person, in every such case the <i>onus probandi</i> shall be upon such claimant.'

Here if the word '<i>libelled</i>' had not been used there could be no doubt. But the expression '<i>libelled</i>' relates as well to seizures on land, as to seizures on water; but seizures on land must be tried by jury according to the course of the common law.

The consequence would have been that this case, involving the same fact, between the same parties, could not have been otherwise tried than by a jury.

Congress could not make cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; and under that clause of the constitution they could not give their courts jurisdiction of a case which was not of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction at the time of the adoption of that constitution. The question, then, is, whether, according to the understanding of the people of this country at that time, a seizure of a vessel, within the body of a county, for breach of a municipal law of trade, was a case of admiralty cognizance. It certainly was never so considered in England, from whence we draw all our ideas of admiralty jurisdiction. All seizures in that country for violation of the laws of revenue, trade, or navigation are tried by a jury in the court of exchequer according to the course of the common law. There is nothing in the course of proceedings <i>in rem</i> which requires that they should be in a court of admiralty. A court of common law is as competent to the trial of such cases as a court of admiralty. The high court of admiralty in England exercises no original jurisdiction in revenue cases. It hears only <i>appeals</i> in such cases from the vice-admiralty courts in the colonies, to whom the jurisdiction is given by an act of parliament. 2 <i>Browne, Civil Law</i>, 492. 2 <i>Rob.</i> 189. <i>The Sarah</i>. 4 <i>Inst.</i> 135. 139. 2 <i>Browne</i>, 75. 78. 3 <i>Bl.

It was one of our serious grievances, and of which we complained against Great Britain in our remonstrances to the King, and in our addresses to the people of Great Britain, while we were colonies, that the jurisdiction of the courts of vice-admiralty was extended to cases of revenue. <i>Journals of the old Congress, vol.</i> 1. <i>p.</i> 47. Such being the understanding of the people of this country at the adoption of the constitution, we are to presume that the words '<i>cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction</i>,' did not include cases of seizure like the present. The 9th section of the judiciary act (<i>vol.</i> 1. <i>p.</i> 53.) is to be construed with a reference to the meaning of those expressions in the constitution; and if it cannot, consistently with the force of its terms, be reconciled with the constitution, it must yield to the superior obligation of that instrument. The words of that section of the act, as far as they affect the present question, are, 'and shall also have exclusive original cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, <i>including</i> all seizures under laws of impost, navigation, or trade, of the United States, where the seizures are made on waters which are navigable from the sea by vessels of ten or more tons burthen, within their respective districts as well as upon the high seas: saving to suiters, <i>in all cases</i>, the right of a common law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it; and shall also have exclusive original cognizance of all seizures on land, or other waters than as aforesaid, made, and of all suits for penalties and forfeitures incurred under the laws of the United States.' 'And the trial of issues in fact in the district courts, in all causes, except civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, shall be by jury.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The word '<i>including</i>,' means only, <i>moreover</i>, or, <i>as well as</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court shall have exclusive original cognizance of <i>all</i> civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, <i>including</i>, within its exclusive original cognizance, all seizures, &amp;c. It does not mean <i>including within the expression</i> '<i>all civil causes of admiralty</i>,' &amp;c. If such cases of seizure were civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, there was no necessity to enumerate them, because the expression, <i>all</i> civil causes of admiralty, &amp;c. certainly included them. If they were not civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, congress could not make them such, nor by forcing them into that class, deprive the citizen of his right to a trial by jury. Congress had no such intention, for in the very same breath they say, 'saving to suiters, in all cases, the right of a common law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it.' We have seen that in all cases of seizure for breaches of the laws of revenue, trade or navigation, the common law is competent to give a remedy; and consequently this suiter is entitled to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The several acts of congress creating forfeitures for breaches of the laws of revenue, &amp;c. all seem to refer to the exchequer practice, rather than to that of the admiralty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the act for registering vessels, passed the 31st <i>of December</i>, 1792, (<i>Oswald's edition of the Acts of Congress, vol.</i> 2. <i>p.</i> 134. 144. <i>sect.</i> 4. <i>and</i> 16.) if the owner shall take a false oath, 'there shall be a forfeiture of the vessel, &amp;c. or of the value thereof, to be recovered <i>with costs of suit</i>,' of the person taking the false oath. So in case of the sale of a vessel to a foreigner it shall be forfeited in a certain case, 'provided that if it shall be made appear to <i>the jury</i> before whom the trial for such forfeiture shall be had, that,' &amp;c. and the penalties and <i>forfeitures</i>, under that act were to 'be <i>sued for, presecuted</i> and <i>recovered</i>,' in such courts, &amp;c. as penalties and forfeitures under the act for the collection of duties, &amp;c. Hence it is evident that congress intended that all cases of forfeiture should be tried by jury. The expressions in the act respecting registering of vessels, explain what may otherwise appear doubtful in the act concerning the collection of duties, as to the mode of prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So in the act suspending intercourse with France, <i>vol.</i> 1. <i>p.</i> 245. offending vessels are made liable to be seized, 'and may be prosecuted and condemned in any <i>circuit</i> or district court of the United States, which shall be holden within or for the district where the seizure shall be made.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But by the judiciary act no <i>circuit</i> court could take original cognizance of civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; hence it is obvious that congress did not consider such seizures as civil causes of admiralty, &amp;c. The forfeiture also is to accrue to any person 'who will <i>inform</i> and <i>prosecute</i> for the same,' which shows that the proceedings were to be at common law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All the forfeitures under the act for the collection of duties, are to be recovered in the same way. <i>Some</i> of them being cases of seizure on land, must be tried by jury, therefore <i>all</i> must. And in sect. 71. (<i>vol.</i> 4. <i>p.</i> 391.) it is said, 'in <i>actions, suits</i> or <i>informations</i> to be brought, where any seizure shall be made pursuant to this act, if the property be claimed by any person, in every such case the <i>onus probandi</i> shall be upon such claimant.'

Here if the word '<i>libelled</i>' had not been used there could be no doubt. But the expression '<i>libelled</i>' relates as well to seizures on land, as to seizures on water; but seizures on land must be tried by jury according to the course of the common law.

The consequence would have been that this case, involving the same fact, between the same parties, could not have been otherwise tried than by a jury.
