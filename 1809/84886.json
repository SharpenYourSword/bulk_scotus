That the said subscribing witness went from the said district to Norfolk, and that when he got there he declared that he should go on further to the south, but where was not known, and the he has not been heard of by the witness for the last twelve months. It appeared that subpoena had been issued in this case, for the said subscribing witness, directed to the marshal of the district of Columbia, but he could not be found in the said district by the said marshal. The plaintiff then offered to prove the hand-writing of the subscribing witness and of the said John Withers to the said writting, but the court refused to permit the plaintiffs to produce evidence of the hand-writing of the said subscribing witness, and refused to permit the plaintiffs to prove the hand-writing of the said John Withers, otherwise than by the testimony of the said subscribing witness; to which refusal the plaintiffs excepted.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>C.
