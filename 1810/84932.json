He was opposed by no <i>physical</i> or <i>legal</i> impediment. The jury have found that the arrest was <i>not as prize</i>, but only to prevent the prosecution of the voyage. The exemption from the general operation of the orders in council of the 11th of November, embraces the case of a vessel sailing from a neutral port direct to an enemey's colony. The words are: 'Nothing herein contained shall extend to subject to capture or condemnation any vessel,' 'belonging to any country not declared by this order to be subjected to the restrictions incident to a state of blockade, which <i>shall have</i> cleared out' 'from some port' 'of the country to which she belongs,' 'direct to some port' 'in the colonies of his majesty's enemies.' The expression <i>shall have</i> must, in grammatical construction, allude to a time which was future when the order was passed, and also to a time which should have passed, before the arrival of that future time. '<i>Which shall have cleared out</i>.' That is, which shall <i>then</i> have cleared out. <i>When?</i> At the time of the seizure. If at the time of seizure the vessel shall have cleared out from a neutral port direct to an enemy's colony, she is within the exception to the general order. If it had been intended to except only those which had cleared out before the 11th of November, the date of the order, the expression would have been, <i>which have</i> cleared out, &amp;c.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the Venus was within the exception to the order, the officer of the Wanderer had no right to prohibit her from proceeding on her voyage; and his prohibition was no justification to the captain in returning to Philadelphia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But even if the order did include this vessel, yet the prohibition was no justification to the captain; because the Isle of France was only nominally, not actually blockaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A constructive blockade, if it be a peril insured against, must be considered as within the denomination of <i>restraints</i>, but, from the terms of the policy, it must be a restraint which comes to the hurt, damage or detriment of the thing insured. It must therefore have been either an actual or a legal restraint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A constructive blockade is not known to the law of nations. Our courts reject it. It is not a <i>legal</i> restraint. 2 <i>Caines</i>, 11. 1 <i>Johns.</i> 253.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the circumstances of the present case are a justification, then every ill founded apprehension of a timorous man may justify an abandonment. There must be peril in point of fact. The misapprehension of a weak man is not sufficient. 3 <i>Bos. &amp; Pull.</i> 392. 5 <i>Esp.</i> 50. <i>Park</i>, 226. The captain ought to have proceeded, that he might himself see whether the port was actually blockaded, or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He ought not to have depended upon the information he received from the Wanderer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Harper</i> in reply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The captain was under a moral incapacity to proceed on his voyage, and was therefore justified in returning. The policy of Great Britain was to interdict this neutral commerce; it was the great object of the order of the 11th of November, 1807. The words <i>shall have cleared out</i>, mean, shall have <i>now</i> cleared out, <i>i. e.</i> before the date of the order. It is immaterial whether this order was warranted by the law of nations, because it was still within the peril of restraint of princes. A probability of capture and condemnation was sufficient. Such a reasonable apprehension as a man of firmness might indulge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\"><i>February</i> 17.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MARSHALL, Ch.

The vessel sailed early in December, 1807, before the British orders in council, of the preceding November, were known in the United States. On the afternoon of the 16th of January, 1808, while prosecuting her voyage, she met the British ship of war Wanderer, by whom she was arrested and detained until the morning of the 18th, when she was restored to the captain, her papers being first endorsed with these words, 'Ship Venus warned off the 18th of January, 1808, by H. M. S. Wanderer, from proceeding to any port in possession of his majesty's enemies.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edward Medley, second lieutenant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The captain was verbally informed by an officer of the Wanderer that the Isle of France was blockaded, and that the Venus would be a good prize if she proceeded thither.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The captain returned to Philadelphia, where he was disabled from prosecuting his voyage by the embargo. Considering the voyage as broken up, by the arrest and detention of his vessel by the Wanderer, he on that account abandoned to the underwriters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal question arising on this case is, was the captain of the Venus justified in returning to Philadelphia, after having proceeded about 1,000 miles on his voyage, either by the endorsement on his papers, or the verbal information given by an officer of the Wanderer?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A point preliminary to the examination of this question on its merits has been made by the plaintiff in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury have found, that 'by the interruption, detainment, and warning off of the British force, the voyage of the said ship Venus was broken up.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After stating the verbal information given by the British officer respecting the blockade of the Isle of France, is this further finding, 'We find, in consequence thereof, that the said Elisha King was fully justified in returning to the port of Philadelphia.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These findings, it is urged, conclude the court, and render this special verdict equivalent to a general one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this court is not of that opinion. It has been truly said, that finding the breaking up of the voyage finds nothing. The question recurs, was the voyage broken up by one of the perils insured against, or by the fault of the captain? The answer to this question determines the liability of the underwriters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has been also truly said that the question of justification is a question of law, not of fact. If, as in this case, the jury find the fact specially, and draw the legal conclusion that the fact amounts to a justification, the court is not bound by that conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case, then, is open to examination on its real merits, unaffected by the particular findings which have been noticed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In proceeding to inquire whether the circumstances which actually occurred, justified the captain of the Venus in returning to Philadelphia, it becomes important to ascertain the real hazard of prosecuting his voyage. This essentially depends on the construction of the British orders of council issued in November, 1807.
