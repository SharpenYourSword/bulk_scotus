The condition of the mortgage was, that if the defendant, Bacon, should pay to the complainant the interest of eight <i>per cent.</i> upon one thousand dollars of eight <i>per cent.</i> stock of the United States, loaned by the complainant to the defendant, and should further pay to the complainant 'the said sum of one thousand dollars,' &amp;c. the deed should be void.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant, Bacon, pleaded the statute of usury, alleging that it was a loan of money and not of stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of the case appeared to be, that the complainant, Samuel De Butts, intending to speculate in a voyage with Captain Elias De Butts, authorized the latter to sell one thousand dollars of eight <i>per cent.</i> stock of the United States, which he did through the agency of the defendant, Bacon, who received the money.
