Boss</i>, who being duly admitted and sworn testified, that Messrs. Taber and Gardner, merchants of Rhode Island, were holders and owners of French government bills to a large amount, which were by them indorsed in blank, and given to their agent, the said John L. Boss to take to France for collection. That he, Boss, had no interest in the bills and received them as agent for the Plaintiffs, and this was known to Perrott and Lee. That he carried them to France in 1802, in a vessel of the Plaintiffs, with a cargo consigned to the Defendants, Perrott and Lee, of Bourdeaux in which cargo Boss had an interest. That he delivered the bills to Perrott and Lee to negotiate and receive the amount. That Boss went to Paris in October, 1802, and while there received a letter on the 26th October, from Perrott and Lee informing him that <i>Hotel, Thomas &amp; Co.</i> of Paris, were the house to whom the bills were sent and introducing him to that house, and they wrote a letter to <i>Hotel, Thomas &amp; Co.</i> directing them, when the bills were paid, to place the money to the credit of Perrott and Bineau, a banking house at Bourdeaux, which Perrott is one of the Defendants. On the 12th of January, 1803, Boss called on Hotel, Thomas &amp; Co. and was informed that the bills had been paid by the French government on the 7th of January preceding, and Boss saw the proceeds of the bills credited on the books of Hotel, Thomas &amp; Co. to the said Perrott and Bineau, according to the directions of Perrott and Lee. That Boss on the 14th January, advised the Defendants that the bills were paid, and directed the proceeds to be applied to the credit of the account of Taber, Gardner and Boss with them. On the 29th of January, at Paris, Boss saw bills of exchange drawn by Perrott and Bineau on Hotel, Thomas &amp; Co. and accepted by them at 30 or 40 days sight, which were acknowledged by the Defendant, Perrott, to have been drawn for the said proceeds. That the said bills so drawn and accepted were in the hands of one Charles Bodin, but whether they have been further negotiated or not, or paid or not, Boss could not tell. That Boss returned to Bourdeaux on the 26th of February, and left Bourdeaux about the 6th of April, 1803. That until the day before he left Bourdeaux he had no intimation from the Defendants that they would not credit the amount of the said bills to the account of Taber, Gardner and Boss.

Perrott and Lee afterwards received the whole balance of the said account from Taber, Gardner and Boss, not having credited the proceeds of the said bills; and the present suit is brought by Taber, surviving partner of Taber and Gardner, the original holders of the bills, to recover their amount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal exception was to the charge of the judge who directed the jury to find for the the Defendants, on the ground that the witness, Boss, had not been made a party Plaintiff in the suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was argued by P.

Boss, were concerned in certain commercial speculations, in the prosecution of which John L. Boss sailed, in 1802 and 1803, to Bourdeaux, in the Polly, with cargoes in which they were jointly interested. On the first voyage, Boss carried with him the bills of exchange for the amount of which this suit was brought, indorsed in blank by the Plaintiff, Gardner, which he delivered to the Defendants for collection. The amount, when collected, was to be placed to the credit of the return cargo of the Polly, in which the Plaintiffs and John L. Boss were jointly concerned. The account was settled without giving credit for the amount of these bills; and Taber, Gardner and Boss have been compelled to pay the balance acknowledged to be due. This action was brought to charge the Defendants with the bills, alleging that their amount has been received.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the trial, the Plaintiffs offered Boss as a witness, for the purpose of proving the liability of the Defendants for the amount of the bills. He swore that he had no interest in the cause nor in the bills; but his testimony was objected to by the Defendants on the ground of his being interested; and the Court was moved to instruct the jury that the action could not be sustained, because Boss was not a party Plaintiff in the declaration. This direction was given by the Court, and excepted to by the counsel for the Plaintiffs.

This might very well be, and yet Taber and Gardner remain the sole owners of the bills. Their amount, if received, might be credited to all the partners in their account with Perrott and Lee, and then be credited to Taber and Gardner in settling the accounts of the partnership. Boss then would have no interest in the bills, unless they should be collected and carried to the credit of the return cargo. That account having been settled without including this item, it is not necessarily implied, from the facts in the case, that Boss was interested; and he swears that he was not.
