Magruder &amp; Co. To entitle themselves to sustain this suit, they allege in their bill that they are creditors and trustees of William B. Magruder &amp; Co. by virtue of a deed of assignment annexed to the bill as part thereof. This exhibit purports to be an assignment to the Complainants of all the partnership effects, debts and credits of William B.

They also deny any knowledge of the deed of trust mentioned in and annexed to the bill, and call upon the Complainants to make full proof of it. To this answer there was a general replication; and the cause being heard upon these proceedings, the exhibits and examination of witnesses and the report of the master commissioner, a decree was rendered for the Complainants for the sum reported to be due from the Defendant to William B.

The answer put this matter directly in issue by denying any knowledge of the deed exhibited with the bill, and requiring full proof to be made of it. This Court is not at liberty to presume that any other proof of this deed was given in the Court below than what appears on the record. That proof consists in the certificate of a person who styles himself clerk of Baltimore county Court, that the paper to which his certificate is annexed, is a copy of a deed taken from the records of the Court of that county; but there is no such certificate as the act of congress requires to satisfy the Court that the attestation affixed to this copy, is in due form. It follows that the instrument so certified cannot be noticed as a copy of a deed from William B. Magruder &amp; Co.; and as it is the foundation of the Complainants' right, the Court erred in decreeing in favor of the Complainants upon such defective evidence. But as this Court cannot fail to perceive that the objection to the proof of this instrument is merely technical, and was probably not made at all in the Circuit Court, it would seem improper to dismiss the bill absolutely.
