Krause, Russian merchants, resident at Riga. The documents and evidence exhibited Martin Krause as the proprietor of the ship, but the captain swears that he considered her as the property of the house of M. &amp; J. Krause, from their having exercised the ordinary acts of ownership over her; and in this belief he is supported by the fact that his contract is made with John Krause, by whom he appears to have been put in command of the ship.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Martin Krause, who appears in the grand bill of sale, is the same Martin Krause who is a member of the firm of M. &amp; J. Krause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all its prominent features, this case bears a striking resemblance to the case of the St. Nicholas. A vessel, documented as Russian, is placed under the absolute controul of a British house, is dispatched under the orders of that house to the Havanna, where she is loaded under the directions of an individual of the name of Muhlenbruck, who assumes the character of agent of the Russian owners; she is then ostensibly cleared out for Riga, but with express orders to call at a British port, and terminate her voyage under the orders of the same house, under the auspices of which the adventure had originated and been so far conducted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, it was certainly incumbent upon the claimant to show the previous correspondence of the British with the Russian house, and the immediate dependence of the agent at the Havanna, upon the Russian house for authority, instructions, and resources. When we come to compare the correspondence of Muhlenbruck with that of Smith, the agent in the St. Nicholas, we find here, also, a striking similitude. In that case, the supposed correspondence with the Russian principal is inclosed under cover to the British house, with a request that they would forward it. In this case the letters covering the invoice and bill of lading, and directed to M. &amp; J. Krause, is confided to the captain, but with express instructions to forward it to the British house, and await their orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The material facts on which the court relies, in making up its judgment on the claim of the cargo, are the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, there is a general shade of suspicion cast over the whole case, by the fact that all the material papers relating to the transaction were mysteriously concealed in a billet of wood. Had there been nothing fraudulent intended, these papers ought to have been delivered along with the documentary evidence. But they were not discovered until betrayed by one of the crew. It is upon the investigation of these papers, principally, that the circumstances occur which discover the true character of this voyage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Secondly. There is no evidence that this adventure was ever undertaken under instructions from M. &amp; J. Krause. But there is evidence that every thing is set in motion at the touch of Bennet &amp; Co. of London. And although they affect to act in the capacity of agents of the Russian house, even the rules of the common law would constitute them principals, in a case in which they cannot exhibit the authority under which they assume the character of agents. Again; there is no evidence that any funds were furnished by the Russian house for the purchase of this cargo. But there is evidence, and we think conclusive evidence, to show that it was purchased on funds of the British house, remitted through the medium of the cargo of the Robert Bruce, a ship loaded by Bennet &amp; Co., and despatched about the same time for the Havanna. In the letter of instructions of the 18th of March, 1813,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the captain is told to proceed to the Havanna and await the arrival of Muhlenbruck, in the Robert Bruce, for orders; and in case of any accidents befalling that vessel. to apply to the Spanish house of Ychazo &amp; Carricabura, at the Havanna, for farther instructions. And in a letter to the house of Lorent &amp; Steinwitz, of Charleston, Bennet &amp; Co. inform them, that the Fortuna is despatched to the Havanna to the address of Ychazo and Carricabura to obtain a freight for the Baltic, and request Lorent &amp; Steinwitz to advise that house, if they could obtain a freight for her to any port in Europe. This correspondence is explained thus: the cargo of the Robert Bruce would probably be sufficient to load this ship with colonial produce; if she arrives in safety, the original adventure can then proceed, but should she be captured or lost, some return freight must then be found for the Fortuna. And accordingly we find in the letter to Bennet &amp; Co. of the 24th March,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Muhlenbruck solicits a credit on Jamaica or Cadiz as he expresses it, 'to be able to settle the surplus of the amount <i>already shipped</i> which may be left out of the proceeds of the outward bound shipment of the Robert Bruce.' Now the only shipment he had then made was by the Fortuna; and this letter gives advice of that shipment, as also of the arrival of the Robert Bruce, and the progress he had made in disposing of her cargo. The passage quoted means, therefore, (although somewhat obscurely expressed,) 'It is possible that the outward cargo of the Robert Bruce may not be sufficient to pay for the shipment already made by the Fortuna, and you must, therefore, furnish me with a credit to make up the deficiency.' Ychazo and Carricabura no doubt advanced for the purchase of the cargo of sugars upon the credit of the cargo of the Robert Bruce, and according y we find that house charging a commission for advancing. On these facts we are satisfied that the cargo was purchased with British funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly; there is no evidence that Muhlenbruck was the agent of M. &amp; J. Krause, and there is abundant evidence of his being the avowed and confidential agent of the British house. We see in the midst of the greatest anxiety to keep up the character of agent to the Russian house, this gentleman, without being aware of it, does an act which at once shows to whom he holds himself accountable. In his letter to Bennett &amp; Co. of the 24th of March, he requests them to inform the Russian house, that he has made certain advances on account of the ship. But why request Bennett &amp; Co. to do this, if he was himself in immediate connection and correspondence with the Russian house? The fact is, his correspondence with the Russian house was fictitious, and his object was to inform Bennett and Co. in reality, whilst he feigned to address himself to M. &amp; J. Krause, and thus the letters to the latter house, covering the invoice and bill of lading, although of the same date with that to Bennett &amp; Co. omits this piece of information, which, in a real correspondence, would be groundwork of a credit to himself, and contains nothing but the most general information, just enough in fact to gloss over the transaction, and give it the aspect of reality.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to the vessel, it would be enough to observe, that if a neutral ship-owner will lend his name to cover a fraud with regard to the cargo, this circumstance alone will subject him to condemnation. But in this case there are, also, many circumstances to maintain a suspicion that the vessel was British property, or at least not owned as claimed. Although this court, from extreme anxiety to avoid subjecting a neutral to condemnation, has relaxed its ruled in allowing time for further proof in a case where there was concealment of papers, yet nothing has been brought forward to support the neutral character of the ship. No charter-party, no original correspondence, nothing, in fact, but those formal papers which never fail to accompany a fictitious, as well as a real, transaction. On the contrary, we find the captain, without any instructions from his supposed owners, submitting implicitly to the orders of Bennett &amp; Co. in every thing; and the latter assuming even a control over the contract which he exhibits with his supposed owner in Riga, and expressing a solicitude about his expenses, which could only have been suggested by a consciousness that the house of B. &amp; Co. would have to pay those expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the whole, we are satisfied that it is a case for condemnation both of ship and cargo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Translation of Exhibit, 287.

Messrs. Bennet &amp; Co.

The first letter principally contained to request the favour of your opening me a credit in Jamaica or Cadiz to be able to settle the surplus of the amount already shipped, which may be left out of the proceeds of the outbound shipment of the Robert Bruce. I hope that the above letter has reached you in time to grant me as soon as possible the favour, and beg to be convinced that only the greatest necessity engages me to request it; not being able to draw on either America or England. I have now the greatest pleasure to inform you of the safe arrival of the Robert Bruce, James Chessel, master, on the 19th, under protection of his majesty's ship North Star, Captain Thomas Coe, from Jamaica. From Cork she sailed with convoy, consisting of his majesty's ship Leviathan 74, Captain Adam Drummond, the Talbot 20, Captain Spelman Swaine, and the Scorpion of 18 guns. Therefore, she has been the whole voyage under convoy, and the insurers have to pay the full returns of 6 per cent. The North Star, which sails to morrow, takes all the ready vessels for Europe out to Bermuda; from thence another convoy will be granted to protect them to England, or at least as far as the latitude of Halifax. The Russian ship Fortuna, Captain Behrens, laden with 1520 boxes assorted sugars bound to Riga, and for account and risk of Messrs. M. &amp; J. Krause at that place is ready to join this convoy. I enclose you invoice and bill of lading, which you will be pleased to forward with the first opportunity to the above friends. The Captain Behrens has got instructions from me to touch, according to the prevailing winds, either in Leith or in the channel. By the present circumstances on the continent of Europe, Messrs. M. &amp; J. Krause may have been induced to send this cargo to a better market than it probably meets at Riga. Should they have given you any instructions concerning this vessel, the Captain Behrens has orders to wait for your kind information in regard of the farther destination, which orders from you I beg to send him as soon as you know at what port of the above mentioned he has arrived in England. Please to inform also Messrs. M. &amp; J. Krause, that I have advanced here the captain, 1332 dollars 4 cents, for the use of ship Fortuna. Next week the cargo of the Robert Bruce will be all delivered, and I endeavour to procure the highest prices possible. The Oznaburgs will sell as well as the Estopillas,</p>\n        <p>but I am sorry you was not able to get more of the latter, and of a finer quality, being always the leading article of an assortment of linen. The prices of sugar are nearly the same, and the arrival of this convoy has brought them up 1-8 to 1-4 dollar higher. Coffee is lower, and I expect to buy and lay in good coffee, at 10 to 11 dollars. Messrs. Hubberts, Taylor &amp; Simpson inform me that I may not expect a convoy leaving Jamaica before the 30th of April. This same convoy can arrive here the 10th or 15th of May, and all possible exertion shall be made on my side to get the Robert Bruco laden before this time. I have till now not received an answer of Messrs. Hibberts, respecting the bills on London. Your kind letter of the 18th of December I have duly received. I am happy that the sugars are bought within your limits, and wish to be as fortunate with those wanted for the Robert Bruce's cargo.

The sugars are of the new crop bought at a moderate price, and of a very good quality. And I flatter myself you will be content with the fulfilment of your kind commission. As there is a convoy leaving this place to-morrow for Bermuda, I found it advisable for the Fortuna to join the same, and wish her a very quick and safe passage.

JOHNSON, Justice, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>Both vessel and cargo, in this case, are claimed in behalf of M. &amp; J. Krause, Russian merchants, resident at Riga. The documents and evidence exhibit Martin Krause as the proprietor of the ship, but the master swears that he considered her as the property of the house of M. &amp; J. Krause, from their having exercised the ordinary acts of ownership over her; and in this belief, he is supported by the fact, that his contract is made with John Krause, by whom he appears to have been put in command of the ship.<sup>[(a)]</sup> *238] Martin Krause, *who appears in the grand bill of sale, is the same Martin Krause who is member of the firm of M. &amp; J. Krause.</p>\n<p>In all its prominent features, this case bears a striking resemblance to the case of The St. Nicholas. A vessel, documented as Russian, is placed under the absolute control of a British house, is dispatched, under the orders of that house, to the Havana, where she is loaded, under the directions of an individual of the name of Muhlenbruck, who assumes the character of agent of the Russian owners; she is then ostensibly cleared out for Riga, but with express orders to call at a British port, and terminate her voyage, under the orders of the same house, under the auspices of which, the adventure had originated and been so far conducted.</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, it was certainly incumbent upon the claimant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*113</span> to show the previous correspondence of the British with the Russian house, and the immediate dependence of the agent at the Havana upon the Russian house for authority, instructions and resources. When we come to compare the correspondence of Muhlenbruck with that of Smith, the agent in the St. Nicholas, we find here also a striking similitude. In that case, the supposed correspondence with the Russian principal is inclosed, *under [*239 cover, to the British house, with a request that they would forward it. In this case, the letters covering the invoice and bill of lading, and directed to M. &amp; J. Krause, is confided to the master, but with express instructions to forward it to the British house, and await their orders.</p>\n<p>The material facts on which the court relies, in making up its judgment on the claim of the cargo, are the following: In the first place, there is a general shade of suspicion cast over the whole case, by the fact, that all the material papers relating to the transaction were mysteriously concealed in a billet of wood. Had there been nothing fraudulent intended, these papers ought to have been delivered along with the documentary evidence. But they were not discovered, until betrayed by one of the crew. It is upon the investigation of these papers, principally, that the circumstances occur, which discover the true character of this voyage. Secondly. There is no evidence that this adventure was ever undertaken under instructions from M. &amp; J. Krause. But there is evidence that everything is set in motion at the touch of Bennet &amp; Co., of London. And although they affect to act in the capacity of agents of the Russian house, even the rules of the common law would constitute them principals, in a case in which they cannot exhibit the authority under which they assume the character of agents. Again, there is no evidence that any funds were furnished by the Russian house, for the purchase of this cargo. But there is evidence, and *we think [*240 conclusive evidence, to show, that it was purchased on funds of the British house, remitted through the medium of the cargo of the Robert Bruce, a ship loaded by Bennet &amp; Co., and dispatched, about the same time, for the Havana. In the letter of instructions of the 18th of March 1813,<sup>[(a)]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*114</span> the *master is told to proceed to the Havana and await the arrival of Muhlenbruck, in the Robert Bruce, for orders; and in case of any accident befalling that vessel, to apply to the Spanish house of Ychazo &amp; Carrickabura, at the Havana, for further instructions. And in a letter to the house of Lorent &amp; Steinwitz, of Charleston, Bennet &amp; Co. inform them, that the Fortuna is dispatched to the Havana, to the address of Ychazo &amp; Carrickabura, to obtain a freight for the Baltic, and request Lorent &amp; Steinwitz to advise that house, if they could obtain a freight for her to any port in Europe. This correspondence is explained thus: the cargo of the Robert Bruce would probably be sufficient to load this ship with colonial produce; if she arrives in safety, the original adventure can then proceed, but should she be captured or lost, some return freight must then be found for the Fortuna. And accordingly, we find in the letter to Bennet &amp; Co., of the 24th *242] March,<sup>[(a)]</sup> Muhlenbruck solicits *a credit on Jamaica or Cadiz, as he expresses it, \"to be able to settle the surplus of the amount already <span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> shipped, which may be left out of the proceeds of the outward bound shipment of the Robert Bruce.\" Now, the only shipment he had then made was by the Fortuna; and this letter gives advice of that *shipment, as also [*243 of the arrival of the Robert Bruce, and the progress he had made in disposing of her cargo. The passage quoted means, therefore (although somewhat obscurely expressed), \"It is possible that the outward cargo of the Robert Bruce may not be sufficient to pay for the shipment already *made by the Fortuna, and you must, therefore, furnish me with a [*244 credit to make up the deficiency.\" Ychazo &amp; Carrickabura, no doubt, advanced for the purchase of the cargo of sugars, upon the credit of the cargo of the Robert Bruce, and accordingly, we find that house charging a commission for advancing. On these facts, we are satisfied, that the cargo was purchased with British funds.</p>\n<p>Lastly, there is no evidence that Muhlenbruck was the agent of M. &amp; J. Krause, and there is abundant evidence of his being the avowed and confidential agent of the British house. We see, in the midst of the greatest anxiety to keep up the character of agent to the Russian house, this gentleman, without being aware of it, does an act which at once shows to whom he holds himself accountable. In his letter to Bennet &amp; Co., of the 24th of March, he requests them to inform the Russian house, that he has made certain advances on account of the ship. But why request Bennet &amp; Co., to do this, if he was himself in immediate connection and correspondence with the Russian house? The fact is, his correspondence with the Russian house was fictitious, and his object was, to inform Bennet &amp; Co., in reality, whilst he feigned to address himself to M. &amp; J. Krause, and thus the letter to the latter house, covering the invoice and bill of lading, although of the same date with that to Bennet &amp; Co., omits this piece of information, which in a real correspondence, would be groundwork of a credit to himself; and contains nothing but the most general information, just enough, in fact, *to [*245 gloss over the transaction, and give it the aspect of reality<sup>[(a)]</sup>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*116</span> With regard to the vessel, it would be enough to observe, that if a neutral ship-owner will lend his name to cover a fraud with regard to the cargo, this circumstance alone will subject him to condemnation. But in this case, there are also many circumstances to maintain a suspicion that the vessel was British property, or, at least, not owned as claimed. Although this course, from extreme anxiety to avoid subjecting a neutral to condemnation, has relaxed its rules in allowing time for further proof, in a case were there was concealment of papers, yet nothing has been brought forwarded to support *246] the neutral character *of the ship. No charter-party, no original correspondence, nothing, in fact, but those formal papers which never fail to accompany a fictitious, as well as a real, transaction. On the contrary, we find the master, without any instructions from his supposed owners, submitting implicitly to the orders of Bennet &amp; Co., in everything; and the latter assuming even a control over the contract which he exhibits with his supposed owner in Riga, and expressing a solicitude about his expenses, which could only have been suggested by a consciousness that the house of B. &amp; Co. would have to pay those expenses.</p>\n<p>Upon the whole, we are satisfied, that it is a case for condemnation both of ship and cargo.</p>\n<p>Decree affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[(a)]  Translation of Exhibit, 287, A. \"On the following conditions, have I given to Captain Henry Behrens, the command of the ship Fortuna, under Russian colors, lying at present in Riga. 1.

The first letter principally contained to request the favor of your opening me a credit in Jamaica or Cadiz, to be able to settle the surplus of the amount already shipped, which may be left out of the proceeds of the outbound shipment of the Robert Bruce. I hope that the above letter has reached you, in time to grant me, as soon as possible, the favor, and beg to be convinced that only the greatest necessity engages me to request it; not being able to draw on either America or England. I have now the greatest pleasure to inform you, of the safe arrival of the Robert Bruce, James Chessel, master, on the 19th, under protection of his majesty's ship North Star, Captain Thomas Coe, from Jamaica. From Cork, she sailed with convoy, consisting of his majesty's ship Leviathan 74, Captain Adam Drummond, the Talbot 20, Captain Spelman Swaine, and the Scorpion of 18 guns. Therefore, she has been the whole voyage under convoy, and the insurers have to pay the full returns of six per cent. The North Star which sails to-morrow, takes all the ready vessels for Europe out to Bermuda; from thence, another convoy will be granted to protect them to England, or at least, as far as the latitude of Halifax. The Russian ship Fortuna, Captain Behrens, laden with 1520 boxes assorted sugars, bound to Riga, and for account and risk of Messrs. M. &amp; J. Krause, at that place, is ready to join this convoy. I inclose you invoice and bill of lading, which you will be pleased to forward with the first opportunity to the above friends. The Captain Behrens has got instructions from me, to touch, according to the prevailing winds, either in Leith, or in the channel. By the present circumstances on the continent of Europe, Messrs. M. &amp; J. Krause may have been induced to send this cargo to a better market than it probably meets at Riga. Should they have given you any instructions concerning this vessel, then Captain Behrens has orders to wait for your kind information in regard of the farther destination, which orders from you I beg to send him as soon as you know at what port of the above mentioned he has arrived, in England. Please to inform also Messrs. M. &amp; J. Krause, that I have advanced here the captain 1332 dollars 4 cents, for the use of the ship Fortuna. Next week, the cargo of the Robert Bruce will be all delivered, and I endeavor to procure the highest prices possible. The Oznaburgs will sell as well as the Estopillas, but I am sorry you was not able to get more of the latter, and of a finer quality, being always the leading article of an assortment of linen. The prices of sugar are nearly the same, and the arrival of this convoy has brought them up 1/3 to ¼ dollar higher. Coffee is lower, and I expect to buy and lay in good coffee, at 10 to 11 dollars. Messrs. Hubberts, Taylor &amp; Simpson inform me, that I may not expect a convoy leaving Jamaica before the 30th of April. This same convoy can arrive here the 10th or 15th of May, and all possible exertion shall be made on my side to get the Robert Bruce laden, before this time. I have till now not received an answer of Messrs. Hibberts, respecting the bills on London. Your kind letter of the 18th of December, I have duly received. I am happy that the sugars are bought within your limits, and wish to be as fortunate with those wanted for the Robert Bruce's cargo. I have the honor, &amp;c.</p>\n     (Signed)          J.F.

JOHNSON, Justice, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>Both vessel and cargo, in this case, are claimed in behalf of M. &amp; J. Krause, Russian merchants, resident at Riga. The documents and evidence exhibit Martin Krause as the proprietor of the ship, but the master swears that he considered her as the property of the house of M. &amp; J. Krause, from their having exercised the ordinary acts of ownership over her; and in this belief, he is supported by the fact, that his contract is made with John Krause, by whom he appears to have been put in command of the ship.<sup>[(a)]</sup> *238] Martin Krause, *who appears in the grand bill of sale, is the same Martin Krause who is member of the firm of M. &amp; J. Krause.</p>\n<p>In all its prominent features, this case bears a striking resemblance to the case of The St. Nicholas. A vessel, documented as Russian, is placed under the absolute control of a British house, is dispatched, under the orders of that house, to the Havana, where she is loaded, under the directions of an individual of the name of Muhlenbruck, who assumes the character of agent of the Russian owners; she is then ostensibly cleared out for Riga, but with express orders to call at a British port, and terminate her voyage, under the orders of the same house, under the auspices of which, the adventure had originated and been so far conducted.</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, it was certainly incumbent upon the claimant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*113</span> to show the previous correspondence of the British with the Russian house, and the immediate dependence of the agent at the Havana upon the Russian house for authority, instructions and resources. When we come to compare the correspondence of Muhlenbruck with that of Smith, the agent in the St. Nicholas, we find here also a striking similitude. In that case, the supposed correspondence with the Russian principal is inclosed, *under [*239 cover, to the British house, with a request that they would forward it. In this case, the letters covering the invoice and bill of lading, and directed to M. &amp; J. Krause, is confided to the master, but with express instructions to forward it to the British house, and await their orders.</p>\n<p>The material facts on which the court relies, in making up its judgment on the claim of the cargo, are the following: In the first place, there is a general shade of suspicion cast over the whole case, by the fact, that all the material papers relating to the transaction were mysteriously concealed in a billet of wood. Had there been nothing fraudulent intended, these papers ought to have been delivered along with the documentary evidence. But they were not discovered, until betrayed by one of the crew. It is upon the investigation of these papers, principally, that the circumstances occur, which discover the true character of this voyage. Secondly. There is no evidence that this adventure was ever undertaken under instructions from M. &amp; J. Krause. But there is evidence that everything is set in motion at the touch of Bennet &amp; Co., of London. And although they affect to act in the capacity of agents of the Russian house, even the rules of the common law would constitute them principals, in a case in which they cannot exhibit the authority under which they assume the character of agents. Again, there is no evidence that any funds were furnished by the Russian house, for the purchase of this cargo. But there is evidence, and *we think [*240 conclusive evidence, to show, that it was purchased on funds of the British house, remitted through the medium of the cargo of the Robert Bruce, a ship loaded by Bennet &amp; Co., and dispatched, about the same time, for the Havana. In the letter of instructions of the 18th of March 1813,<sup>[(a)]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*114</span> the *master is told to proceed to the Havana and await the arrival of Muhlenbruck, in the Robert Bruce, for orders; and in case of any accident befalling that vessel, to apply to the Spanish house of Ychazo &amp; Carrickabura, at the Havana, for further instructions. And in a letter to the house of Lorent &amp; Steinwitz, of Charleston, Bennet &amp; Co. inform them, that the Fortuna is dispatched to the Havana, to the address of Ychazo &amp; Carrickabura, to obtain a freight for the Baltic, and request Lorent &amp; Steinwitz to advise that house, if they could obtain a freight for her to any port in Europe. This correspondence is explained thus: the cargo of the Robert Bruce would probably be sufficient to load this ship with colonial produce; if she arrives in safety, the original adventure can then proceed, but should she be captured or lost, some return freight must then be found for the Fortuna. And accordingly, we find in the letter to Bennet &amp; Co., of the 24th *242] March,<sup>[(a)]</sup> Muhlenbruck solicits *a credit on Jamaica or Cadiz, as he expresses it, \"to be able to settle the surplus of the amount already <span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> shipped, which may be left out of the proceeds of the outward bound shipment of the Robert Bruce.\" Now, the only shipment he had then made was by the Fortuna; and this letter gives advice of that *shipment, as also [*243 of the arrival of the Robert Bruce, and the progress he had made in disposing of her cargo. The passage quoted means, therefore (although somewhat obscurely expressed), \"It is possible that the outward cargo of the Robert Bruce may not be sufficient to pay for the shipment already *made by the Fortuna, and you must, therefore, furnish me with a [*244 credit to make up the deficiency.\" Ychazo &amp; Carrickabura, no doubt, advanced for the purchase of the cargo of sugars, upon the credit of the cargo of the Robert Bruce, and accordingly, we find that house charging a commission for advancing. On these facts, we are satisfied, that the cargo was purchased with British funds.</p>\n<p>Lastly, there is no evidence that Muhlenbruck was the agent of M. &amp; J. Krause, and there is abundant evidence of his being the avowed and confidential agent of the British house. We see, in the midst of the greatest anxiety to keep up the character of agent to the Russian house, this gentleman, without being aware of it, does an act which at once shows to whom he holds himself accountable. In his letter to Bennet &amp; Co., of the 24th of March, he requests them to inform the Russian house, that he has made certain advances on account of the ship. But why request Bennet &amp; Co., to do this, if he was himself in immediate connection and correspondence with the Russian house? The fact is, his correspondence with the Russian house was fictitious, and his object was, to inform Bennet &amp; Co., in reality, whilst he feigned to address himself to M. &amp; J. Krause, and thus the letter to the latter house, covering the invoice and bill of lading, although of the same date with that to Bennet &amp; Co., omits this piece of information, which in a real correspondence, would be groundwork of a credit to himself; and contains nothing but the most general information, just enough, in fact, *to [*245 gloss over the transaction, and give it the aspect of reality<sup>[(a)]</sup>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*116</span> With regard to the vessel, it would be enough to observe, that if a neutral ship-owner will lend his name to cover a fraud with regard to the cargo, this circumstance alone will subject him to condemnation. But in this case, there are also many circumstances to maintain a suspicion that the vessel was British property, or, at least, not owned as claimed. Although this course, from extreme anxiety to avoid subjecting a neutral to condemnation, has relaxed its rules in allowing time for further proof, in a case were there was concealment of papers, yet nothing has been brought forwarded to support *246] the neutral character *of the ship. No charter-party, no original correspondence, nothing, in fact, but those formal papers which never fail to accompany a fictitious, as well as a real, transaction. On the contrary, we find the master, without any instructions from his supposed owners, submitting implicitly to the orders of Bennet &amp; Co., in everything; and the latter assuming even a control over the contract which he exhibits with his supposed owner in Riga, and expressing a solicitude about his expenses, which could only have been suggested by a consciousness that the house of B. &amp; Co. would have to pay those expenses.</p>\n<p>Upon the whole, we are satisfied, that it is a case for condemnation both of ship and cargo.</p>\n<p>Decree affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[(a)]  Translation of Exhibit, 287, A. \"On the following conditions, have I given to Captain Henry Behrens, the command of the ship Fortuna, under Russian colors, lying at present in Riga. 1.
