The defendant had been appointed to the office by the State of Virginia, and continued to exercise its duties until the year 1818, during all which time his official acts were recognised by the United States. In that year he was removed by the Governor and Council of Virginia, and the plaintiff appointed in his place. The writ was brought, by consent of parties, to try the title to the office, waiving all questions of form, and of jurisdiction. Judgment was given in the Court below for the defendant, and the cause was brought by writ of error to this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\"><i>March</i> 6<i>th.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cause was argued by Mr. <i>Hardin</i>, for the plaintiff, and by the <i>Attorney-General</i> and Mr. <i>Scott</i>, for the defendant.

It is, therefore, the opinion of this Court, that the judgment of the Circuit Court ought to be reversed, and the cause remanded to that Court, with directions to dismiss the information because it is not filed at the instance of the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>18 U.S. 134 (____)</b></center>\n<center><b>5 Wheat. 134</b></center>\n<center><h1>WALLACE<br>\nv.<br>\nANDERSON.</h1></center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center></center>\n<p>March 6th, 1820.
