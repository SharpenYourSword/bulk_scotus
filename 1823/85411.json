He stated, that the plaintiffs below, Palmer and others, were described to be aliens, and subjects of the king of Great Britain, and the defendants, Gracie and others, to be citizens of the State of New-York; and the suit was brought in the Circuit Court of Pennsylvania. It did not appear, that the defendants were inhabitants of, or found in the District of Pennsylvania, at the time of serving the writ; and he, therefore, contended, under the 11th section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, c. 20. that no civil suit could be brought against them by original process in that District.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Chief Justice MARSHALL stated, that the uniform construction, under the clause of the act referred to, had been, that it was not necessary to aver, on the record, that the defendant was an inhabitant of the District, or found therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That it was sufficient if the Court appeared to have jurisdiction by the citizenship or alienage of the parties.
