It was alleged, there is no sufficient averment on the record, of the citizenship of the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complainants, Henry Shultz, and Christian Breithaupt, are stated to be citizens of the state of South Carolina. The defendant, The Bank of the State of Georgia, is a body corporate; but the citizenship of the individual corporators is not stated. The averment, in the original bill, is, that 'William B. Bullock, and Samuel Hale, are citizens of Georgia, residents therein.' William B. Bullock is subsequently designated, as 'President of the Mother Bank, and Samuel Hale, as President of the Branch Bank at Augusta, in the state of Georgia.' There are three amendments to the bill, but there is, in none of them, any further averments. The answer denies the jurisdistion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant's counsel insisted, that the citizenship of the individual corporators should have been alleged; and that the want of jurisdiction is apparent upon the face of the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. M'Duffie, in support of the jurisdiction of the Court, contended, that the objection to the jurisdiction was founded on a misapprehension of the decisions of this Court. None of those decisions go further than to say, that if, on the face of the record, it appears that there are parties, who are not citizens of another state, the Courts of the United States will not accept jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the bill, the complainants are said to be citizens of South Carolina; and William B. Bullock, the President of the Mother Bank, and Samuel Hale, the President of the Branch Bank, are citizens of the state of Georgia; and there is no ground for the allegation, that other persons, not citizens of the state, are interested. The party who claims the jurisdiction, is not bound to prove that no other persons, but citizens of Georgia, are interested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bank exists under an Act of Incorporation, passed by the state of Georgia, and this Court will look at the Act; which having a general operation, may be considered as a public Act. 1 <i>Black. Com.</i> 85. If this is done by the Court, they cannot say others than citizens of Georgia, are members of the Corporation. Cases cited, in which the question of jurisdiction has been examined: 3 <i>Dal.</i> 382, Cabot <i>vs.</i> Bingham. 5 <i>Cranch</i>, 57. 3 <i>Cranch</i>, 267. 3 <i>Wheat.</i> 591.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy of the Constitution, in relation to jurisdiction, is to include suits against corporations, although all who are interested, are not citizens of the same state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The influence of such corporations, in the state where they exist, makes this appeal to other than state tribunals, expedient. When an action is instituted against trustees by citizens of another state, would the jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States be taken away, by showing that some of those who had a fiduciary interest, were not citizens of the same state with the trustees? The question must be settled, by adverting to the local usages of Georgia; and there suits are brought against the individuals who represent the Bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Berrien, and Mr. Wilde, for the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pleadings show that there is no allegation of citizenship in the stockholders of the bank, the owners of its funds; and the point is fully settled, that all the parties who are sued, shall be averred to be citizens of another state, from that of the plaintiff or complainant in the suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A body corporate, as such, is incapable of citizenship, according to the true meaning of the law giving jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court has decided, that they will go behind the act of incorporation, and ascertain the character of the individual corporators, and if they find them citizens of another state, the suit may be maintained; but there must be an averment of such citizenship, as to every stockholder. 5 <i>Cranch</i>, 57. 6 <i>Wheat.</i> 146.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The possession of the fund cannot give the Court jurisdiction, as that was the possession of a corporation. No jurisdiction can be obtained, because of the difficulties in suits against the corporation of one state, by citizens of another; and it is denied that any such difficulties exist in Georgia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>By the Court</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a case within the jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States.
