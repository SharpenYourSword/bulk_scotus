But the Court is of opinion, that the question of title cannot be considered on this writ of error. The town of Falmouth was separated from the tract out of which it was taken, and this lot was sold before the suit was instituted; neither the trustees of the town, nor the proprietors of the lot, were parties to that ejectment. The motion to award restitution, therefore, involved nothing further than the lot to which the party prayed to be restored; and as that is not of the value of 2,000 dollars, the Court has no jurisdiction.
