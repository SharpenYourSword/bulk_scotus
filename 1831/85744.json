It has already been decided that the courts of the United States have jurisdiction in suits brought by the bank, only by virtue of the special provision in the charter; and the right of the bank to sue in the district court of Alabama is not given by the act incorporating the bank. He refered to the tenth section of the act of congress of September 1789: and to the act of the 21st of April 1820, constituting the courts of Louisiana.
