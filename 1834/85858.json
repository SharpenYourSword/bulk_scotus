That afterwards, to wit on or about the 28th day of June in the year 1806, the said Thade Kosciuszko, being then domiciled at Paris, in the kingdom of France, executed a certain instrument of writing, being in the nature and of the effect of a last will or writing testamentary, whereby he willed and directed that at his decease, the sum of three thousand seven hundred and four dollars, current money, should be possessed by, and delivered over to the full enjoyment and use of the complainant; and the said testator thereby instructed and authorized his only lawful executor in the United States, the said Thomas Jefferson, to reserve, in trust for that special purpose, of the funds he held belonging to the testator, the aforesaid sum of three thousand seven hundred and four dollars, in principal to the complainant, to be paid by him, the said Thomas Jefferson, immediately after his decease, to the complainant, and, in case of his death, to the use and benefit of his surviving brothers. That the said testator, on the day and year aforesaid, duly signed and sealed the said instrument of writing in the presence of two competent witnesses, who attested the same, and acknowledged the same, on the same day, before Fulwar Skipwith, commercial agent and agent for prize causes for the said United States, at Paris; and then delivered the same, under his hand ans seal, to John Armstrong, father of the complainant. That afterwards, to wit on the 15th day of October in the year 1817, the said Thade Kosciuszko departed this life, leaving the said instrument of writing unrevoked; and the same was, after the death of the said Thade Kosciuszko, admitted to probate, and duly proved in the orphan's court of Washington county; a copy whereof, exhibit B, he prays may be taken as a part of his bill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That he is advised, and believes that the said instrument of writing is, to all intents and purposes, a last will and testament, and must operate as such, and revokes <i>pro tanto</i> the bequests and appropriation made in the will first mentioned; that the said Thomas Jefferson, named as executor in the will first mentioned, refused to take out letters testamentary on the estate of the said Thade Kosciuszko, and renounced all claim and right so to do, according to law; and Benjamin L. Lear, whom the complainant prays may be made defendant to this his bill, was duly appointed administrator, with the will annexed, on the said estate; which has since come into the hands of the said Benjamin L. Lear, far exceeding, as aforesaid, ten thousand dollars. That the said Benjamin L. Lear has been frequently applied to by the complainant for the payment of the aforementioned legacy of three thousand seven hundred and four dollars, together with the interest thereon, which the said Lear refuses to pay, until the order and decree of this court had upon the premises; and the said defendant combining and confederating with one major Estho, a subject of his imperial majesty, the emperor of all the Russias, and Monsieur Zeltner, formerly minister plenipotentiary of the Helvetic Republic at Paris, and now residing at Soleure in Switzerland, whom the complainant prays may be made parties to this his bill of complaint; the said confederates sometimes pretend that the said Thade Kosciuszko never executed the said the last mentioned writing testamentary, and sometimes they pretend that the said major Estho is the heir at law of the said Thade Kosciuszko, and, as such, entitled to all his said estate; and sometimes they pretend that the said Thade Kosciuszko, during his lifetime, made some disposition of his said estate in favour of the children and other relatives of the said Zeltner, whereas the said last mentioned writing testamentary was duly executed as aforesaid; and that the said major Estho is not the heir at law of the said Thade Kosciuszko, or if he is, that he is not entitled to receive distribution of the said personal estate, and that the said Thade Kosciuszko made no testamentary or other disposition in favour of the said Zeltner, or his children or relatives, which could affect the claim of the complainant under the said writing testamentary.

That afterwards, to wit on the 15th day of October 1817, the said Kosciuszko departed this life, leaving the said instrument of writing unrevoked, and the same has since been duly admitted to probate, and proved in the orphan's court of Washington county. That the said Thomas Jefferson, named as executor in the will first mentioned, refused to take out letters testamentary on the estate of the said Kosciuszko; and thereupon the defendant Lear was duly appointed administrator with the will annexed. The bill further charges that the said Lear refuses to pay the said sum of three thousand seven hundred and four dollars, because, among other reasons, a claim to the whole of the funds of said estate has been made by said major Estho, as heir at law of said Kosciuszko, and another claim by the said Monsieur Zeltner under another will, which he alleges the said Kosciuszko to have made in Europe, in favour of himself or some of his relations; and the complainant states the object of his said bill to be, to enforce a discovery, by said Lear, of the funds and effects which have come to his hands as administrator as above named, and the payment by him to the complainant of said sum of three thousand seven hundred and four dollars, with interest, &amp;c. And it appearing to the court that two of the defendants in this case, viz. the said major Estho and Monsieur Zeltner, are not within the jurisdiction of this court, and do not reside within the United States, but, as far as appears to the court, one of the said defendants resides in Poland, and the other in Switzerland: it is therefore, by this court here, on motion of the complainant's solicitor, ordered, this 3d day of August 1829, that the said absent defendants be and appear before this court here, in person or by solicitor, on or before the second Monday of December next, and answer the complainant's said bill, or show cause why a decree should not be passed as prayed by said bill: otherwise, the same will be taken for confessed against them, provided a copy of this order be published in the National Intelligencer twice a week, for six weeks successively, the first publication thereof to be at least four months previous to said second Monday of December next.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By order of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Teste, WILLIAM BRENT, <i>Clerk</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3<i>d August</i> 1829.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1831 Benjamin L.

That this respondent admits that the instrument mentioned in the complainant's bill, and exhibited to this court by him, marked exhibit B, was executed and authenticated, as it purports to be, at Paris, in the kingdom of France, the said Thade Kosciuszko being domiciled and resident at said Paris at the time said instrument was executed and bears date; but this defendant submits to this honourable court, and prays its decision thereon, whether it will decree him to pay the said sum of three thousand seven hundred and four dollars to the said complainant, upon an instrument made under the circumstances, and authenticated in the manner that the aforesaid instrument is; and whether said instrument shall have the effect to revoke or alter any part of said Kosciuszko's will solemnly executed, and left in the hands of his executor in this country, to be carried into execution at his death, and especially when it appears, from this defendant's exhibit A, that the said executor had received, from his testator, a letter of so late date as the 15th of September 1817, in which he says of this fund, 'after my death you know its invariable destination.' And this defendant submits to the decision of this honourable court, whether, if the instrument aforesaid, being genuine and properly authenticated, is of the nature and effect of a will or testament, the said letter of the testator to his executor does not operate as a revocation of said instrument, and a re-establishment and republication of his former will? And this defendant, further answering, saith, that he believes it to be true that the said Thomas Jefferson, named as executor in said Kosciuszko's will, refused to take out letters testamentary on his estate, and renounced all claim and right so to do, according to law. And this defendant saith, that he was, on the 14th day of August in the year 1821, appointed by the orphan's court, of the county of Washington, district of Columbia, the administrator, with the will annexed, of the estate of the said general Thaddeus Kosciuszko, and received from the said orphan's court, letters of administration with said will annexed, a copy of which is herewith exhibited to this court, marked defendant's exhibit C, and which this defendant prays may be taken as part of this his answer. That, after receiving said letters of administration, there came to the hands of this defendant from the said Thomas Jefferson, as the estate of said Kosciuszko, two certificates of the six per cent stock of the United States&#8212;one of eleven thousand three hundred and sixty-three dollars and sixty-three cents, and the other of one thousand one hundred and thiry-six dollars and thirty-six cents, and one certificate of stock of the Bank of Columbia, of forty-six shares, amounting, at their par value, to four thousand six hundred dollars. That the appraisers appointed by the aforesaid orphan's court to estimate the value of said stocks, appraised them both at par, taking into consideration the advance of the market price of the one, and the depreciation of that of the other, and their respective amounts, and appraising them both together. That, after the receipts of said certificates, there came to the hands of this defendant, dividends upon said stocks to the amount of four thousand one hundred and four dollars, which he invested, with the consent of said orphan's court, in six per cent stocks of the said United States, and which purchased of said stock of the United States a certificate of three thousand seven hundred and ninety-four dollars and twenty-four cents, and that there have since come to his hands, as dividends upon all of said stocks, five hundred and eighty dollars and eighty-two cents, making the whole amount of the estate of said Kosciuszko, which has came to his hands, twenty thousand eight hundred and ninety-four dollars and twenty-three cents of stocks estimated at their par value, and five hundred and eighty dollars and eighty-two cents in cash. This defendant, further answering to the bill of said complainant, saith, that among the papers which came to his hands, as herein before mentioned, is a letter from the aforesaid Mr De Poletica, to the said Thomas Jefferson, enclosing a copy of a despatch from the viceroy of Poland to him, a copy of which letter and despatch is herewith exhibited to this honourable court, marked defendant's exhibit D; and by which this defendant understands that the whole estate of said Kosciuszko may be claimed by a major Estho, of Poland, as the heir at law of said Kosciuszko. That this respondent communicated to said Poletica in April last, such information as he possessed in relation to said estate, and was informed by said Politica that the same would be transmitted to the said viceroy of Poland. That there was also, among the papers aforesaid, two letters from a Mr Zeltner to said Thomas Jefferson, copies of which are herewith exhibited, marked 'defendant's exhibit E, and defendant's exhibit F,' by which this defendant understands, that the said Kosciuszko has disposed of the greater part of his fortune in favour of the children, nieces, brothers and sister of the said Zeltner, and that his (said Kosciuszko's) parents were living in Poland at the date of the first of said letters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\"><i>Exhibit</i> A.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\"><i>Monticello, June</i> 12, 18</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sir, I have received your favour of May 27, on the subject of the property of the late general Kosciuszko, vested in our funds, and left under my care and direction. A little before the departure of the general from America, in 1798, he wrote a will, all with his own hand, in which he directed, that the property he should possess here, at the time of his death, should be laid out in the purchase of young negroes, who were to be educated and emancipated: of this will he named me executor, and deposited it in my hands. The interest of his money was to be regularly remitted to him in Europe. My situation in the interior of the country, rendered it impossible for me to act personally in the remittances of his funds, and Mr John Barnes, therefore, of Georgetown, was engaged under a power of attorney to do that on commission; which duty he regularly and faithfully performed until we heard of the death of the general. We had, in the mean time, by seasonably withdrawing the greater part of his funds from the bank in which he had deposited them, and lending them to the Government during the late war, augmented them to seventeen thousand one hundred and fifty-nine dollars and sixty-three cents: to wit, twelve thousand four hundred and ninety-nine dollars and sixty-three cents in the funds of the United States, and four thousand six hundred dollars in the Bank of Columbia, in Georgetown. I delayed, for a considerable time, the regular probate of the will, expecting to hear from Europe, whether he had left any will there, which might affect his property here. I thought that prudence and safety required this, although the last letter he wrote me before his death, dated September 15, 1817, assured me of the contrary in these words, 'nous avancons tous en  age, c'est pour cela, mon cher et respectable ami, que je vous prie de vouloir bien (et comme vous avez tout le pouvoir) arranger qu' apre &#167; la mort de notre digne ami Mr Barnes, quelqu'un d'aussi probe que lui prenne sa place, pour que je recoive les int er ets ponctuellement de mon fonds; duquel, apres ma mort, <i>vous savez la destination invariable</i>, quant a pr esent faites pour le mieux comme vous pensez.' After his death, a claim was presented to me on behalf of Kosciuszko Armstrong, son of General Armstrong, of three thousand seven hundred and four dollars, given in Kosciuszko's lifetime, payable out of this fund; and subsequently came a claim to the whole from Mr Zeltner, of Soleure, under a will made there. I proceeded, on the advice of the attorney-general of the United States, to prove the will in the state court of the district in which I reside, but declined the executorship. When the general named me his executor, I was young enough to undertake the duty, although, from its nature, it was like to be of long continuance; but the lapse of twenty years more, had rendered it imprudent for me to engage in what I could not live to carry into effect: finding now, by your letter of May 27, that a relation of the general's also claims this property, that it is likely to become litigious, and age and incompetence to business admonishing me to withdraw myself from entanglements of that kind, I have determined to deliver the will and whole subject over to such court of the United States as the attorney general of the United States shall advise, (probably it will be that of the District of Columbia) to place the case in his hands, and to petition that court to relieve me from it, and to appoint an administrator with the will annexed. Such an administrator will probably call on the different claimants to interplead, and let the court decide what shall be done with the property. This I shall do, sir, with as little delay as the necessary consultations will admit, and when the administrator is appointed, I shall deliver to him the original certificates which are in my possession: the accumulating interest and dividends remain untouched in the treasury of the United States and Bank of Columbia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I learnt with much pleasure your return to the United States, and in a character, which enables you to do much good to your own, as well as to our country.

But the bill does not go on to state that it has been duly established by that as a valid will, according to the law of France, though that is averred to be the place of domicil of Kosciuszko at the time of its execution. The bill, however, does assert, that the instrument is a last will and testament, to all intents and purposes, and must operate as such, and revoke, pro tanto, the bequests and appropriation in the prior will, of which Mr Jefferson was named executor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The answer of the administrator (Lear) is substantially the same as his former answer, admitting the execution of the instrument, but submitting to the court (without denying in a formal and direct manner the validity of the will as such, according to the law of France), whether it will decree the defendant to pay the money to the plaintiff 'upon an instrument made under the circumstances, and authenticated in the manner that the aforesaid instrument is, and whether the said instrument shall have effect to revoke or alter any part of said Kosciuszko's will, solemnly executed and left in the hands of his executor in this county,' &amp;c. &amp;c. This is certainly a very informal and loose mode of putting in issue, if upon the bill such a question can be tried, the validity of a will made in a foreign country, whose laws are not brought before the court, either by averment or evidence. But the answer contains a new allegation, that certain persons residing in Europe have filed a bill in the circuit court of the district of Columbia, against him, the administrator, claiming a large portion of the assets, if not the whole, as executor in this country,' &amp;c. &amp;c. said Kosciuszko; and certain persons, also residing in Europe, have filed another bill against him (it was probably meant in the same court), claiming the whole assets, as heirs at law of the said Kosciuszko, and therefore as distributees of the said assets. None of the parties to either of these latter bills are made parties to the present bill. And we are of opinion, that the persons claiming as heirs of Kosciuszko, should be made parties, that they may have an opportunity to contest the plaintiff's title, as the real parties in interest, the administrator being but a mere stake holder. Indeed, we think that all three of the bills ought (if possible) to be brought to a hearing at the same time in the circuit court, in order that a final disposition may, at the same time, be made of all of the questions arising in all of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We wish also to attract the attention of counsel to some other considerations, which may become important in future stages of the cause; and especially, in the aspect under which the present bill and answer are framed. In the first place, if the intention is to put in issue (as it seems to be), not only the construction and operation of the testamentary instrument in favour of the plaintiff, but its validity and effect as a <i>will</i>, it is material that the law of France, the place of the domicil of Kosciuszko at the time of its execution, should be brought before the court, and established as matter of fact; for the court cannot judicially take notice of foreign laws; but they must be proved by proper evidence. The present allegations of the bill and answer are quite too loose for this purpose; and they should be amended, and made more distinct and direct. We do not mean to express any opinion, whether this court can examine into the point of the validity of the instrument as a will according to the law of France, or whether it belongs exclusively to the orphan's court of the county of Washington. That is a question which it may be fit hereafter to examine, if it should be pressed in argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the next place, there may arise some nice questions of international law, in which the fact of the domicil of Kosciuszko at the time of his birth, at the time of his making the will of which Mr Jefferson was named executor, and at the time of his death, may become material. We do not mean to say, what is the true rule that is to govern in cases of wills of personalty, whether it be the rule of the native domicil, or of the domicil at the time of the execution of the will, or of the domicil at the death of the party, where there have been changes of domicil. These are points, which ought, under the circumstances of this case, to be left open for argument. But the facts on which the argument should rest, ought to be distinctly averred in the bill, and met in the answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The place of domicil of Kosciuszko at the time of his death, may also become material under another aspect of the case, viz. the question, who are his heirs, entitled to the succession ab intestato, or under the other will or wills executed by him, to which reference is made in some of the papers in the case. The persons claiming as such heirs, must establish their title under, and according to the law of his domicil at the time of his death. So that perhaps it may become material, if Switzerland was the domicil of Kosciuszko at the time of his death, to bring the law of that country distinctly, as matter of fact, before the court. The court have, in another case<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn(a)\" id=\"fn(a)_ref\">(a)</a> expressed their desire to have the other will or wills made by Kosciuszko, put regularly upon the record to ascertain whether they have any bearing upon the merits of the present case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also material to observe, that the answer of the administrator relies on a letter written by Kosciuszko to Mr Jefferson in September 1817, as a revocation of the supposed testamentary paper in favour of Armstrong, and a republication of the first will; and yet that letter is not produced in evidence, nor even the extract verified; so that there is a total deficiency of proof as to this most material fact.
