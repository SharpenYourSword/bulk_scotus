The writ of scire facias is against the heirs and devisees of Deneale, and was issued on the 17th day of May 1828. The scire facias was returned executed on two of the defendants, the others not found. Two nihils having been returned against the defendants who were not found, an office judgment was entered against them all. At the succeeding term, Mary Deneale and Nancy P. Deneale, on whom the process had been executed, set aside the office judgment and demurred to the scire facias. The plaintiffs joined in demurrer. The same defendants farther pleaded, 'that the plaintiffs ought not to have or maintain their said execution, because they say that the judgment recited in the said scire facias was rendered more than ten years next prior to the day of the date of the said scire facias.' The plaintiffs reply, that after the death of the said George Deneale, the plaintiffs issued out of the circuit court of the said District of Columbia held for the county of Alexandria, a scire facias against the said Mary Deneale executrix of the said George Deneale, to show cause, if any she could, why the plaintiffs should not have execution of their judgment aforesaid of the goods and chattels which were of the said George Deneale, and which came to the hands of the said Mary Deneale to be administered. On which scire facias such proceedings were had, that by the judgment of the court it was considered that the plaintiffs should have execution of their said judgment, &amp;c.; on which said award of execution accordingly, on the 10th day of January 1820, an execution was by the plaintiffs issued out, returnable on the fourth Monday in March 1820, and on which execution the marshal made the following return&#8212;'no property found to levy this execution upon.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this replication the defendants demurred, and the plaintiffs joined in demurrer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court, overruling the demurrer, both to the scire facias and to the replication, rendered judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against all the defendants.
