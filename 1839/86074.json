The grant is upon a condition, namely, the erection of a water sawmill; 'and with the precise condition that until he executes said machinery, this grant will be considered as null and void, and without effect or value until that event takes place,' &amp;c.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mill was never erected. No sufficient reason is shown for its non-erection.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is insisted that the erection of the mill is a condition precedent; and, consequently, that until the claimant shows a performance of that condition, or some reason for non-performance, which will satisfy the terms of the eighth article of the treaty ceding Florida to the United States, he has no title in law or equity.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is believed to be fully decided against the claimants by the decisions of this Court at its last term; in the cases of the United States <i>vs.</i> Mills's heirs, 12 Peters, 215; and United States <i>vs.</i> Kingsley, 12 Peters, 476.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice WAYNE delivered the opinion of the Court.&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case, like that of the United States <i>vs.</i> Andrew Burgeon, is controlled by the decision of this Court in the case of the United States <i>vs.</i> Kingsley, 12 Peters, 476.
