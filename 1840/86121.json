It is unnecessary to state the nature of the controversy more fully for the purposes of this motion. The bill it seems came to final hearing before the vice-chancellor of the first circuit of the state of New York, who dismissed the bill without prejudice to the complainant's right to make the same defendants parties to a new bill, if he should think proper to file one against the second trustees or the survivor of them.

Now if it were admitted that the second decree is in collision with the first, (which we certainly do not mean to say is the case,) yet the article of the Constitution above quoted cannot; by any just construction of its words, be held to embrace an error of that description, nor give this Court the right to review the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The writ of error must therefore be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record of the Court of Chancery of the state of New York, returned with the writ of error in this case, and was argued by counsel.
