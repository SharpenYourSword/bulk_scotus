On the 6th of March, the plaintiff in error appeared in court, by his counsel, and produced and filed with the clerk the record of the case, and moved the court to strike out the judgment of dismissal, and to continue the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of dismissal, under the rule above mentioned, is a judgment <i>nisi;</i> and it may be stricken out, at any time during the term, upon motion, unless it appears that the omission to file the record, and docket the case, at an earlier period of the court, has been injurious to the inteests of the defendant in error. The motion to reinstate addresses itself to the sound discretion of the court; and care will always be taken, in granting the rule, that no injustice is done to the opposite party. In the case of <i>Owings</i> v. <i>Tiernan's Lessee</i>, 10 Pet. 24, the motion to dismiss, and the motion by the plaintiff in error, to docket the case, were contemporaneous; and the court said, that the motion of the plaintiff ought had been sued out although in that case it appeared, that the writ of error had been sued out to the preceding term of this court. According to this decision, the motion of the plaintiff in error must have prevailed, if it had been contemporaneous with that of the defendant; and the delay since does not appear to have operated injuriously to him, nor to have retarded, in any degree, the ultimate decision of the case. For if the record had been filed at the time of the motion to dismiss, it is now evident, from the state of the term, that the case could not have been reached and disposed of, during the present session of the court.
