A motion was made in arrest of judgment, which was overruled by the court, to which overruling the second exception was taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cause was argued by <i>Mr. Chalmers</i> and <i>Mr. Coxe</i>, for the plaintiff in error, and by <i>Mr. Stanton</i> and <i>Mr. Z. Collins Lee</i>, for the defendants in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Chalmers</i> and <i>Mr. Coxe</i> contended that the paper admitted in evidence by the court below, purporting to be a copy of the protest of the bill of exchange sued upon, was not duly proved to have been a copy of the protest of the bill of exchange, but a copy of an entry in the notary's book, and that it was not duly proved, even as a copy of the entry in the book.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Secondly, if proved as a copy, it was not admissible as evidence, without laying ground for it by showing the loss of the original, which was not done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A protest is, properly speaking, a solemn declaration on behalf of the holder against any loss to be sustained by non-acceptance or non-payment (Story, Bills, &#167; 276, p. 301), must be in writing, signed, and sealed by the notary (Chit., Bills, 490, 642), and annexed to the bill itself, if it can be obtained or otherwise a copy (Chit., Bills, 362), with all the indorsements transcribed <i>verbatim</i>, with the reasons given by the party why he does not honor the bill; and this is so indispensably necessary, by the custom of merchants, that it cannot be supplied by witnesses or oath of the party, or in any other way, and, as is said, is part of the constitution of a foreign bill of exchange, because it is the solemn declaration of a notary, who is a public officer, recognized in all parts of Europe, that a due presentment and dishonor has taken place, and all countries give credit to his certificate of the facts. Chit., Bills, 490. It must be made according to the laws of the place where the payment ought to have been made. Story, Bills, p. 105, &#167; 278; Chit., Bills, 490. By the laws of Louisiana, where this bill was payable, it is enacted, page 41, Ball. &amp; C. Dig., Laws of Louisiana, that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The notaries shall keep a separate book in which they shall <i>transcribe</i> and <i>record</i>, by order of date, all the protests by them made, minutes of notices, &amp; c., &amp;c., made by them, which declaration, duly recorded under signature of such notary and two witnesses,' &amp;c.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This book, from which the copy admitted was obtained, is a new <i>transcription</i> of the original protest,&#8212;a copy, wholly inadmissible itself, without accounting for the non-production of the original, and yet the court admitted a copy of this copy, without showing the loss, destruction, or that the original was not within the control of the party offering the copy. See <i>Sebree</i> v. <i>Dorr</i>, 9 Wheat., 558; <i>Brooks</i> v. <i>Marbury</i>, 11 Id., 78.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Secondly, the court below erred in overruling plaintiff in error's motion to arrest the judgment. This suit in the court below was commenced jointly against the drawers and indorsers of the bill of exchange sued upon under and by virtue of the provisions of an act of the Legislature of the State of Mississippi, and a long count of the declaration is framed upon that act, which provides, that 'in all actions founded upon bills of exchange and promissory notes the plaintiff shall be compelled to sue the drawers and indorsers living and resident within the State in a joint action.' Act of May 13, 1837, Laws of Mississippi, 717; and by a rule of the District Court of the United States for the State of Mississippi, this act was adopted (see Rule XXX.), and, so far as it is not inconsistent with the laws of Congress and the rules of practice prescribed by the Supreme Court of the United States, became by that rule the law of the court. This being the case unless the act of the legislature of Mississippi, in its application to this case, was incompatible with the laws of Congress, or the rules prescribed by the Supreme Court of the United States, or the existing rules of the District Court for Mississippi, the dismissal entered as to defendants below, Isaac Clymer, William C. Ivins, and Benjamin C. Polk, the makers, and taking judgment against McAfee, the plaintiff in error and indorser of the bill sued upon, was manifest error, for which the judgment should have been arrested. See <i>Wilkinson and Turney</i> v. <i>Tiffany, Duvall, &amp; Co.</i>, 5 How. (Miss.), 411. Was the act of Mississippi, adopted by the District Court in its application to this case, a violation of the judiciary act of 1789, ch. 20? The eleventh section of that act gives jurisdiction to the Circuit Courts of suits between a citizen of the State where the suit is brought and a citizen of another State, and excepts 'any suit to recover the contents of any promissory note, or other chosen action in favor of an assignee, unless the suit might have been prosecuted in such court to recover the contents, if no assignment had been made except in cases of foreign bills of exchange.' The foundation of this action was a foreign bill of exchange, and although the drawers and indorser all resided in the State of Mississippi, it came within the exception of the act of Congress, and the District Court neither enlarged or diminished the jurisdiction of the court by adopting the rule, nor is the rule in its application to this case incompatible with the laws of Congress, the rules of practice prescribed by the Supreme Court of the United States, or the existing rules of the District Court. The case of <i>Keary et al.</i> v. <i>The Farmers and Merchants' Bank of Memphis</i>, 16 Pet., 89, was founded upon a promissory note, the makers and indorser all living in Mississippi, and the attempt, under this rule, to join them in the same action was pronounced by this court a violation of the judiciary act, in giving a jurisdiction to the District Court which that act had not conferred, and that, therefore, in that case the rule was void. Not so however in this case,&#8212;the foundation of this suit being a foreign bill of exchange, the application of the rule violates no law of Congress, nor is it incompatible with any rule prescribed by this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule established by the District Court, adopting the statute of Mississippi, is of great value to the citizens of that State; and, so far as it can be made applicable to the just jurisdiction of the District Court of the United States in that State, sound public policy, respect for her public functionaries, and the rights and interests of the parties litigant in the federal tribunals of the State, appeal strongly to this court to have the act fairly and fully executed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Lee</i> and <i>Mr. Stanton</i> contended that the proof offered was sufficient; that the object of a protest was accomplished in giving the indorser notice; that certified copies of a protest were generally admissible; that a notary cannot serve the original protest upon each one of the indorsers; that the absence of the original at the trial was sufficiently accounted for by its being on file in the notary's office, and cited Story, Bills, 301, 304; 20 Wend. (N. Y.), 82; 8 Wheat., 333; 4 T. R., 175; 2 Pet., 179.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the second exception, they contended that the plaintiffs living in New York had a right to sue the indorser and drawers, which right could not be taken away; that they had a right to discontinue the action as they did; that the plaintiff in error was estopped from making this objection; that this court has rejected the statute of Mississippi, and cited 1 Pet., 78; 11 Id., 83-85; 16 Id., 94; 2 How., 343.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice McLEAN delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is brought before this court by a writ of error to the District Court of the Northern District of Mississippi.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suit was commenced on a bill of exchange against Isaac Clymer, Benjamin C. Polk, William C. Ivins, and Hiram Clymer, late merchants and partners in trade, under the firm and style of Clymer, Polk, &amp; Co., makers, and Morgan McAfee, indorser. The process was served on Polk and McAfee. The latter pleaded the general issue, and an <i>alias</i> summons was issued against the defendants not served. This writ was served on Isaac Clymer and William C. Ivins; and at the succeeding June term the plaintiffs, by leave of the court, discontined the suit against Clymer, Polk, &amp; Co., leaving McAfee, the indorser, the only defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the trial the plaintiffs offered the deposition of H. B. Cenas, a notary public at New Orleans, to prove a copy of the protest, which was objected to by the defendant; but the court admitted the evidence, and this constitutes the first exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the Louisiana acts of 1821 and 1827, the notary is required to record, in a book kept for that purpose, all protests of bills made by him and the notices given to the drawers or indorsers; a certified copy of which record is made evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these statutes it is held, in Louisiana, that 'a certified copy of a protest is sufficient without producing the original.' <i>Whittemore</i> v. <i>Leake</i>, 14 La., 394.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is admitted that in respect to foreign bills of exchange the notarial certificate of protest is of itself sufficient proof of the dishonor of a bill, without any auxiliary evidence. <i>Townsley</i> v. <i>Sumrall</i>, 2 Pet., 179. But the rule is different, under the principles of the common law, in regard to inland bills.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The protest offered is certified, under the seal of the notary, 'to be a true copy of the original protest, draft, and memorandum of the manner in which the notices were served on file and of record in his office.' But the deposition of Cenas, the notary, was relied on as proving the protest and notice. The exception taken was not to the deposition, but to the copy of the protest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is insisted that the deposition does not identify the protest, and if it does, that it is not competent to prove the copy without accounting for the non-production of the original.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In regard to the latter objection, it appears from the statutes above cited, that the notary records the protest and the manner in which notice was given, and this record is, in fact, the original. It is presumed that nothing more than a short memorandum of the demand and notice is taken, from which the record is made in due form; so that there is, strictly, no original except that which is of record. And a copy of this is made evidence by the statute. Now this sufficiently accounts for the non-production of the original; and a sworn or a certified copy is the only evidence of the protest which can be produced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And we think that the copy of the protest was properly considered as a part of the deposition. It was offered in connection with it, and is referred to as 'Document A.,' as no other meaning can be given to that reference. The commissioner who took the deposition states, the copy was sworn to before him, and the exception was to the 'copy' and not that it was no part of the deposition. And the original being a matter of record, and of course not within the power of the plaintiffs in the Circuit Court, a sworn copy was admissible as evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the verdict was rendered against McAfee, the indorser, a motion was made in arrest of judgment on the ground that it appeared from the return of the marshal, the process had been duly served on three of the partners of the firm of Clymer, Polk, &amp; Co., who were the drawers of the bill, and that the suit had been discontinued as to them; which motion the court overruled, May 1837, which excepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appears that the district judge, by a rule of court, adopted nine of the first sections of the statute of Mississippi, entitled 'An act to amend the laws respecting suits to be brought against indorsers of promissory notes,' &amp; c., approved 13th</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">May 1837, which required suit to be brought against the drawers and indorsers of a bill of exchange jointly. Under this statute the suit was brought against the drawers and also the indorser of the bill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This statute as adopted by the district judge, was brought before this court in the case of <i>Keary and others</i> v. <i>The Farmers and Merchants' Bank of Memphis</i>, 16 Pet., 89, in which the court held that 'the law of Mississippi is repugnant to the provisions of the act of Congress, giving jurisdiction to the courts of the United States.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no objection, in principle or in practice, to the discontinuance of the suit against the drawers of the bill.

Collins Lee, for the defendants in error.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> Mr. Justice McLEAN delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>This case is brought before this court by a writ of error to the District Court of the Northern District of Mississippi.</p>\n<p>The suit was commenced on a bill of exchange against Isaac Clymer, Benjamin C. Polk, William C. Ivins, and Hiram Clymer, late merchants and partners in trade, under the firm and style of Clymer, Polk, &amp; Co., makers, and Morgan McAfee, indorser. The process was served on Polk and McAfee. The latter pleaded the general issue, and an alias summons was issued against the defendants not served. This writ was served on Isaac Clymer and William C Ivins; and at the succeeding June term the plaintiffs, by leave of the court, discontinued the suit against Clymer, Polk, &amp; Co., leaving McAfee, the indorser, the only defendant.</p>\n<p>On the trial the plaintiffs offered the deposition of H.B. Cenas, a notary public at New Orleans, to prove a copy of the protest, which was objected to by the defendant; but the court admitted the evidence, and this constitutes the first exception.</p>\n<p>By the Louisiana acts of 1821 and 1827, the notary is required to record, in a book kept for that purpose, all protests of bills made by him and the notices given to the drawers or indorsers; a certify copy of which record is made evidence.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> Under these statutes it is held, in Louisiana, that \"a certified copy of a protest is sufficient without producing the original.\" Whittemore v. Leake, 14 Louisiana Reports, 394.</p>\n<p>It is admitted that in respect to foreign bills of exchange the notarial certificate of protest is of itself sufficient proof of the dishonor of a bill, without any auxiliary evidence. Townsley v. Sumrall, 2 Peters, 179. But the rule is different, under the principles of the common law, in regard to inland bills.</p>\n<p>The protest offered is certified, under the seal of the notary, \"to be a true copy of the original protest, draft, and memorandum of the manner in which the notices were served on file and of record in his office.\" But the deposition of Cenas, the notary, was relied on as proving the protest and notice. The exception taken was not to the deposition, but to the copy of the protest.</p>\n<p>It is insisted that the deposition does not identify the protest, and if it does, that it is not competent to prove the copy without accounting for the non-production of the original.</p>\n<p>In regard to the latter objection, it appears from the statutes above cited, that the notary records the protest and the manner in which notice was given, and this record is, in fact, the original. It is presumed that nothing more than a short memorandum of the demand and notice is taken, from which the record is made in due form; so that there is, strictly, no original except that which is of record. And a copy of this is made evidence by the statute. Now this sufficiently accounts for the non-production of the original; and a sworn or a certified copy is the only evidence of the protest which can be produced.</p>\n<p>And we think that the copy of the protest was properly considered as a part of the deposition. It was offered in connection with it, and is referred to as \"Document A.,\" as no other meaning can be given to that reference. The commissioner who took the deposition states, the copy was sworn to before him, and the exception was to the \"copy\" and not that it was no part of the deposition. And the original being a matter of record, and of course not within the power of the plaintiffs in the Circuit Court, a sworn copy was admissible as evidence.</p>\n<p>After the verdict was rendered against McAfee, the indorser, a motion was made in arrest of judgment on the ground that it appeared from the return of the marshal, the process had been duly served on three of the partners of the firm of Clymer, Polk, &amp; Co., who were the drawers of the bill, and that the suit had been discontinued as to them; which motion the court overruled, and to which the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p>It appears that the district judge, by a rule of court, adopted nine of the first sections of the statute of Mississippi, entitled \"An act to amend the laws respecting suits to be brought against indorsers of promissory notes,\" &amp;c., approved 13th May 1837, which required <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> suit to be brought against the drawers and indorsers of a bill of exchange jointly. Under this statute the suit was brought against the drawers and also the indorser of the bill.</p>\n<p>This statute, as adopted by the district judge, was brought before this court in the case of Keary and others v. The Farmers and Merchants' Bank of Memphis, 16 Peters, 89, in which the court held that \"the law of Mississippi is repugnant to the provisions of the act of Congress, giving jurisdiction to the courts of the United States.\"</p>\n<p>We see no objection, in principle or in practice, to the discontinuance of the suit against the drawers of the bill. Their liability was distinct from that of the indorser. In no respect could the indorser be prejudiced by the discontinuance. As a matter of course it was permitted at the cost of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>In the case of Minor et al. v. The Mechanics' Bank of Alexandria, 1 Peters, 46, the court held, that when the defendants sever in their pleadings, a nolle prosequi ought to be allowed against one defendant,\" that \"it is a practice which violates no rules of pleading, and will generally subserve the public convenience. In the administration of justice, matters of form not absolutely subjected to authority may well yield to the substantial purposes of practice.\"</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Order.</h2>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Mississippi, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said District Court in this cause be and the same is hereby affirmed, with costs and damages, at the rate of six per centum per annum.</p>\n</div>", "id": 86401, "judges": "McLean", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/86401/", "sha1": "f3243357d0f8786ac54ec8b19374a36bd7460af8", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:00:26"}
