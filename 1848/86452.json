The result of the second trial was a judgment in favor of the New England Bank for $4,245.24, with interest upon parts of this sum from various times.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence offered on the part of the plaintiff, and also that on the part of the defendant, are stated in the bill of exceptions, with a reference to a great number of letters and accounts. This evidence must be inserted in substance, in order to render intelligible the prayers to the court. The first prayer was made by the defendant, and does not appear to have been excepted to by the plaintiff, although granted by the court; but the plaintiff then made a prayer for himself, which was also granted by the court, and excepted to by the defendant, and upon this exception the case came up. But the case cannot be fully understood without spreading all this upon the report of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Evidence on the part of the plaintiff, viz. the New England Bank</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the trial of this cause, the plaintiffs, to maintain the issue on their part joined, offered evidence tending to show, that, from the year 1834 to the year 1838, there had been extensive mutual dealings between the Bank of the Metropolis, in the city of Washington, and the Commonwealth Bank, a bank in Boston, in the State of Massachusetts, at which place the plaintiffs' bank is also situated; that both of these banks (the Metropolis and the Commonwealth) were selected by the government of the United States as deposit banks, and in consequence became extensively employed as agents for other banks, and for individuals, in the transmission of negotiable paper for collection in the manner usual among such institutions; that the usage well known and established universally in the District of Columbia, and throughout this country, in such cases, is for the holder of negotiable paper to indorse and deliver it, without any consideration, to a bank (or, if the bank is the holder, to another bank), to be indorsed and delivered by such bank with which it has been so deposited to another bank, and so on to transmit it from bank to bank till it reaches its place of destination; that when it is paid, the proceeds are credited to the bank by which it was last indorsed, and by that bank to its indorser, and so on back to the owner; but it is not usual for the banks to remit the precise amount so collected at the time of such collections, but to place the same to the general credit of the bank from which it was received, to be settled by drafts or otherwise, as might be most convenient for such banks respectively; and in case of non-payment, the costs thereof and postage are charged from the one bank to the other till the owner is charged therewith; that it is also the usage and custom of the banks receiving such paper to treat it in all respects as they do their own paper, but it is not usual for any bank to purchase negotiable paper from another bank. That the said Bank of the Metropolis and the said Commonwealth Bank were extensively engaged in collecting and remitting to each other for collection, on account of other banks and individuals, negotiable paper, deposited with either for that purpose, and in that business they conformed to the usage aforesaid in the mode of transmitting such paper by indorsement, and also in the mode of keeping their accounts of such business; and it was the uniform practice of the said Commonwealth Bank, in transmitting such paper, to accompany the same with a letter, advising the Bank of the Metropolis that it was 'forwarded for collection' (letters copied in pages 22, &amp;c.); but in some instances they transmitted negotiable paper by letters in the following form (copied in pages 25, &amp;c.); that in the course of the said dealing between the said two banks, repeated instances occurred in which the Bank of the Metropolis directed the said Commonwealth Bank to deliver to third parties negotiable paper, which had been forwarded by the former to the latter; and such direction was complied with, and the paper delivered according to such order, without reference to the state of the accounts between the said two banks; and also, that either of the said two banks drew upon the other, from time to time, or directed remittances to be made, without having regard to the negotiable paper which had been before them, or was expected to be remitted for collection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They further offered evidence tending to show, that, during the fall of the year 1837, the plaintiffs, being the holders of certain negotiable paper coming due in the District of Columbia, at various times during the said fall and winter, indorsed and delivered such paper to the said Commonwealth Bank, without consideration, as the agent of the plaintiffs for that purpose, and according to the usage and custom above stated, to be transmitted by said Commonwealth Bank to the said District for collection; and the said Commonwealth Bank, from time to time, as it received the said paper from the plaintiffs, indorsed and delivered the same, without consideration, and according to the said usage and custom, to the said defendants, and in delivering them to defendants, they advised defendants that such paper was forwarded for collection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That on the 13th day of January, 1838, there were in the hands of the defendants certain bills and notes, the property of the plaintiffs, and which had been indorsed and delivered by plaintiffs to the Commonwealth Bank, in manner and according to the usage and custom above stated, for collection, without consideration, and which had been indorsed by the last-mentioned bank to the Bank of the Metropolis, and forwarded to the said defendants in letters, advising them in every instance that the said paper was forwarded for collection; that on the said 13th day of January, 1838, the said Commonwealth Bank gave to the plaintiffs an order in writing, addressed to the defendants, as follows (copied in pages 27, &amp;c.); that the said letter was immediately forwarded by due course of mail to, and received by, the defendants; that the said negotiable paper amounts to the sum of $4,466.75; that none of the said paper was due or had been paid to the defendants at the time of the receipt by them of said order of the 13th January, 1838, except the sum of $241.01, and that sum had been carried to the credit of the Commonwealth Bank in the general account with said bank, and that the residue of the said paper was afterwards, and before the bringing of this suit, paid to the said defendants; that the said negotiable paper, in the said order of the 13th January, 1838, mentioned, was part of the paper indorsed and delivered in the fall of 1837, as above stated, to the Commonwealth Bank by the plaintiffs, according to the usage and custom above stated, without consideration, to be collected for the plaintiffs, according to the said usage and custom, and was, at the time of such delivery, and ever after, the property of the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And the plaintiffs further offered in evidence the following deposition of Charles Hood, viz.:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'I, Charles Hood, now of Dorchester, in the county of Norfolk, in Massachusetts, formerly of the city of Boston, in the county of Suffolk, on oath depose and say, that I was cashier of the Commonwealth Bank from the time of its commencing to the time of its closing business; said bank having been a bank established by law in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and having transacted business in Boston. I further depose and say, that the papers exhibited by me to the magistrate taking my deposition, for the purpose of being annexed thereto, and marked A, B, and C (copied in pages 33, &amp;c.), are original accounts current rendered by the Bank of the Metropolis, in Washington city, to said Commonwealth Bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The said papers are all the accounts rendered by the said Bank of the Metropolis to the said Commonwealth Bank, which I can now find; said Bank of the Metropolis rendered one or more accounts subsequent to these, which I cannot find, the same having been lost or mislaid. I cannot find any previous account rendered by said Bank of the Metropolis. The principal part of the items on the credit side of said account consists of checks and drafts drawn by said Bank of the Metropolis on said Commonwealth Bank; each draft or check being indicated in the account by its number. I further depose and say, that there was not, to my knowledge, at any time any agreement or understanding between said two banks, that the balances due, from time to time, from one bank to the other, should be suffered to remain in the hands of either, to be met by the proceeds of negotiable paper already transmitted, or expected to be transmitted, in the usual course of business between them. If there had been any such understanding or agreement between said banks, I have not the least doubt I should have known it. There was no usage or practice between said banks to allow any such balances due to the Commonwealth Bank to remain undrawn for, to be met by the proceeds of negotiable paper transmitted, or expected to be transmitted. I do not know of any usage or practice on the part of the Bank of the Metropolis to allow balances due to said bank from the Commonwealth Bank to remain undrawn for, to be met by proceeds of paper transmitted, or to be transmitted, in the usual course of business between said banks. I further depose and say, that, in fact, the Commonwealth Bank drew on the Bank of the Metropolis for its balances as often as its business or convenience required, without reference to the negotiable paper held at the time, or expected to be transmitted in the usual course of business, for payment or collection, between said banks. This practice was uniform. I further depose and say, that, in pursuance of an understanding between said banks, each of them occasionally overdrew upon the other, as its convenience required. I further depose and say, the two papers exhibited by me to the magistrate taking this deposition, for the purpose of being annexed thereto, marked D, E (copied in page 55, &amp;c.), are true copies of letters transmitted by said Commonwealth Bank to said Bank of the Metropolis, at or about the time of their respective dates. I further depose and say, that the said two banks were, among others, originally selected as deposit banks by the government. The deposit banks became extensively the agents of other banks and institutions, for the purpose of making collections in various and distant parts of the United States. It has never been the practice of banks, as far as I know, to purchase negotiable paper held by other banks, and take the indorsement of such other banks, or without such indorsement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'CHARLES HOOD.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs also offered in evidence a great number of letters and accounts which had been transmitted between the Bank of the Metropolis and the Commonwealth Bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence offered on the part of the Bank of the Metropolis was as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'And the said defendants, in order to maintain and prove the issue on their part, gave to the jury competent and legal evidence tending to prove that it is and has long been the uniform practice and usage of the banks in the District of Columbia, when commercial paper is transmitted to it for collection by banks or individuals, when indorsed by the party so remitting it, and in the absence of information that any other person or party has an interest therein, to treat and deal with the party so making the remittance as the owner of the same, the proceeds, when received, are credited to his account, and he is charged in said account with all the expenses attending the same, as costs, protests, postage, &amp;c. That this usage and practice uniformly prevailed in the dealings between the said Commonwealth Bank and the Bank of the Metropolis; that they mutually transmitted funds and paper of different kinds to each other, government drafts, certificates of deposit, bills, notes, and drafts of private individuals; that all, of every description, were carried into the general accounts current between the two institutions, which are both banking institutions, regularly and duly chartered, and engaged exclusively in the business of banking; that, in the account current, each bank was regularly credited by the other with the proceeds of all such commercial paper thus received by it from the other, when collected, and charged with the costs of collection, protests, and postage connected with the same. That on the 13th of January, 1838, the said Bank of the Metropolis was in the possession of the bills, drafts, notes, &amp;c., being all commercial and negotiable paper, enumerated and mentioned in the said letter from C. Hood of that date, the same having been, from time to time, transmitted by said Commonwealth Bank to said Bank of the Metropolis, in the course of their said mutual dealings and business, in letters; which letters from said Commonwealth Bank, so far as they are deemed material, are as follows (copied in the record). That each of said drafts, bills, notes, &amp;c., was indorsed by the payees thereof, respectively, to the New England Bank, specially indorsed by the cashier of said New England Bank to the cashier of the Commonwealth Bank, and by him likewise specially indorsed to the cashier of the Bank of the Metropolis; that the same had all been transmitted within the two or three months preceding the said 13th of January; that all said paper was indorsed and transmitted in the same form in which paper the property of the bank remitting the same was indorsed and sent. That the said Commonwealth Bank failed, and became publicly insolvent, early in January, 1838, before the said letter of the 13th of January was written; that said letter contained and gave the first information, or notice, ever received by the Bank of the Metropolis, that said New England Bank was, or claimed to be, the owner of said paper so held by the Bank of the Metropolis. That the accounts between said parties, so kept as aforesaid, were regularly received by, and transmitted from, said banks respectively (the Commonwealth and Metropolis Banks), and no objection was ever made to the form or manner thereof, the last of which is here inserted (A, defendants' statement, copied in the record); that the balances were sometimes large, sometimes small, sometimes in favor of the one, sometimes of the other; that on the 24th of November, 1837, the balance was in favor of the Commonwealth Bank to the amount of $2,200; that at the time the said letter of 13th of January, 1838, was written and received, the balance due to the Bank of the Metropolis was $3,541.17 1/2.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\"><i>Defendants' Prayer</i>.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whereupon the defendants, by their counsel, prayed the court to instruct the jury,&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That if, from the evidence aforesaid, they shall find that the course of dealing between the said Commonwealth Bank and the Bank of the Metropolis, as stated in said evidence, actually existed, and had continued for several years prior to January, 1838; that their dealings had been mutual and extensive; that accounts current existed between them, in which they were respectively credited with the proceeds of all notes, bills, drafts, &amp;c., transmitted to the other for collection when the same were received, and charged with all the expenses attending the same, as postage, costs of protests, &amp;c.; that from time to time such accounts were regularly transmitted from each to the other, which accounts were mutually acquiesced in without objection; that the balances on the account current fluctuated from time to time, according to the amount of money, bills, notes, &amp;c., remitted; that upon the credit of such negotiable paper thus transmitted or expected to be sent, or upon the credit of such mutual dealings, each party was in the practice of drawing and accepting drafts and orders on or by the other; that said banks uniformly received the notes, bills, drafts, &amp;c., transmitted by the other for collection, and always regarded and treated them as the property of the other; that the notes, drafts, and bills enumerated in the letter from C.

That the paper in question was, however, the property of the New England Bank, and was indorsed and delivered to the Commonwealth Bank for collection, without consideration, as its agent, in the ordinary course of business, it being usual, and indeed necessary, so to indorse it in order to enable the agent to receive the money. Yet the possession of the paper was <i>prim a facie</i> evidence that it was the property of the last-mentioned bank; and, without notice to the contrary, the plaintiff in error had a right so to treat it, and was under no obligation to inquire whether it was held as agent or owner.

The court gave both, as asked. In the defendant's statement, the facts given in evidence are detailed. In the instruction given at the instance of plaintiff, some portion of these facts is stated. The main difference between the two seems to consist in this. In the defendant's prayer, the supposed state of facts to be found by the jury includes this,&#8212;'that the defendant had no notice or knowledge, until the receipt of said letter from C. Hood to G.

We have examined them with a good deal of care, and regret to find them so complicated and involved, that we have some difficulty in ascertaining the meaning of the Circuit Court. It would seem to be almost impossible for a jury acting under such instructions to comprehend distinctly the issues of fact upon which they were to find their verdict. Indeed, as we understand these two instructions, the last paragraph in the second seems to this court to be inconsistent with the direction contained in the first. And if the last instruction stood by itself, without any reference to the first, it might perhaps be construed to be substantially the same with the directions given by the Circuit Court at the former trial, which were reversed upon the former writ of error.</p>\n<p>It is not usual in remanding a case to state in the opinion of this court the particular manner in which the instructions to the jury should have been framed, but to state in the opinion the principles of law which govern the case as it appears in the record, and leave it to the Circuit Court to apply them to the case, as it may appear in evidence upon the second trial, in such manner and form as it may think advisable. From the manner, however, in which the directions of the Circuit Court appear in the record before us, upon the trial under the mandate, we may perhaps prevent future difficulty by stating the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*227</span> form in which instructions to the jury might have been given so as to carry into effect the opinion of this court, and enable the jury to understand more clearly the points in issue before them. Of course we do not mean to prescribe this form to the Circuit Court when the case again comes before it, because the testimony then offered may differ materially from that now contained in the record. But if, instead of the complex instructions under which the case was decided at the last trial, the following directions had been given, it would have conformed to the opinion of this court when the case was formerly before it, and at the same time have enabled the jury to understand more distinctly the matters of fact in dispute between the parties, and submitted to them for decision.</p>\n<p>1. If, upon the whole evidence before them, the jury should find that the Bank of Metropolis, at the time of the mutual dealings between them, had notice that the Commonwealth Bank had no interest in the bills and notes in question, and that it transmitted them for collection merely as agent, then the Bank of the Metropolis was not entitled to retain against the New England Bank for the general balance of the account with the Commonwealth Bank.</p>\n<p>2. And if the Bank of the Metropolis had not notice that the Commonwealth Bank was merely an agent, but regarded and treated it as the owner of the paper transmitted, yet the Bank of the Metropolis is not entitled to retain against the real owners, unless credit was given to the Commonwealth Bank, or balances suffered to remain in its hands to be met by the negotiable paper transmitted or expected to be transmitted in the usual course of the dealings between the two banks.</p>\n<p>3. But if the jury found that, in the dealings mentioned in the testimony, the Bank of the Metropolis regarded and treated the Commonwealth Bank as the owner of the negotiable paper which it transmitted for collection, and had no notice to the contrary, and upon the credit of such remittances made or anticipated in the usual course of dealing between them balances were from time to time suffered to remain in the hands of the Commonwealth Bank, to be met by the proceeds of such negotiable paper, then the plaintiff in error is entitled to retain against the defendant in error for the balance of account due from the Commonwealth Bank.</p>\n<p>We restate the former opinion of this court in this form, because we presume it must have been misunderstood by the Circuit Court. And as it was not followed in the proceedings under the mandate, the judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions to award a venire facias de novo.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*228</span> Order.</h2>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Columbia, holden in and for the county of Washington, and was argued by counsel.
