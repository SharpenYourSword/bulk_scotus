CRAWFORD<br>v.<br>HENRY ADDISON.</p>\n    <p class=\"date\">December Term, 1859</p>\n    <div class=\"prelims\">\n      <p class=\"indent\">THIS was an application for a peremptory mandamus or for a rule to show cause why the judges of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia should not execute a judgment in that court, by which Henry Addison had been directed to be ousted of the mayoralty of Georgetown. Addison had sued out a writ of error, returnable to December term, 1860, and filed the usual bond, which the Circuit Court decided to amount to a supersedeas, and accordingly suspended the judgment of ouster. <i>Mr. Brent</i> and <i>Mr. Carlisle</i>, counsel for Crawford, filed his petition, accompanied by a transcript of the record, and moved for a peremptory mandamus or a rule to show cause. The motion was opposed by <i>Mr. Bradley</i> and <i>Mr. Henry Winter Davis</i>. The reporter has only notes of the arguments of <i>Mr. Carlisle</i> and <i>Mr. Bradley</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was agreed by the counsel, that the office of mayor, referred to in the proceedings in this case, is elected for two years, and that the salary is $1,000 per annum, payable monthly. The record so stated.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Carlisle</i> contended that the writ of error had been improvidently issued in this case, and consequently there was no supersedeas. The act of 1816 (3 Stat. at L., 261) provides that no cause shall hereafter be removed from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Columbia to the Supreme Court of the United States by appeal or writ of error, unless the matter in dispute in such cause shall be of the value of $1,000 or upwards, exclusive of costs. He then made the following points:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Whether, assuming that the Government is entitled to execution of the judgment of ouster, and the relator to his execution for costs, the proper remedy is by mandamus from this court. That it is the proper and only adequate remedy where execution is improperly denied by the court below, and in other like cases, has been repeatedly held by this court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States <i>v.</i> Peters, 5 Cranch, 115.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Livingston <i>v.</i> Dorgenois, 7 Cranch, 577.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Life and Fire Insurance Co. <i>v.</i> Wilson, 8 Peters, 303.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Postmaster General <i>v.</i> Trigg, 11 Peters, 173.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stafford <i>v.</i> Union Bank of Louisiana, 16 Howard, 135.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stafford <i>v.</i> Union Bank of Louisiana, 17 Howard, 276.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. That it is mere matter of discretion, whether the rule to show cause or, to prevent delays, the alternative mandamus is to be granted. It must depend upon the nature of the case.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Life and Fire Insurance Co. <i>v.</i> Adams, 9 Peters, 571.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, the record shows in advance the sole cause against the mandamus. The question is concerning the title to an office of public trust, the term of which will be about immediately expiring at the commencement of the next term of this court. Nearly one-half the term has been consumed in the proceedings below; and as the record here shows, it is established by verdict and judgment, that during all the time which has elapsed, the office has been occupied without any lawful warrant, to the defeat of the popular will, in violation of the charter of the city, and to the prejudice of the relator's right. It seems not easy to imagine a case where the discretion of the court can be more appropriately exercised in dispensing with the rule, and proceeding at once to consider the cause shown.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It remains now to inquire whether the cause shown by the record is sufficient for the denial of the motion.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That cause is, that the judgment of ouster and for costs is superseded by reason of the matters in that behalf spread upon the record.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And the sole question now is, is the judgment effectually superseded under the statutes of the United States?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The means of determining the question are before the court, in the transcript filed with the petition.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It cannot be denied, that this court will entertain such a question, and determine the legality of the supposed supersedeas, where it is alleged as cause against the mandamus. The cases already cited abundantly show this. In the case in 16 Howard, this court itself suggested the remedy by mandamus, where a supersedeas had been improvidently allowed by the court below. And in the case in 5 Cr. (U. S. <i>v.</i> Judge Peters) the cause of refusing execution being shown to be an act of the Legislature of Pennsylvania, this court, upon the motion for mandamus, considered the constitutionality of that act, pronounced it unconstitutional, and awarded a peremptory mandamus.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So that it would seem, when the question of supersedeas or no supersedeas arises, and is necessary to be determined upon a mandamus for execution, this court will determine every question, of whatever nature, necessarily involved in the principal inquiry.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other instances, the question of the validity of the supersedeas has arisen here in cases where there was an admitted jurisdiction of the cases on writ of error or appeal&#8212;the question being whether, notwithstanding such admitted jurisdiction, the judgment or decree below ought not to be executed, by reason of a failure to comply with the terms of the statute regulating the supersedeas.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here we maintain that there could be no possible superdeas, because the case is not one in which a writ of error lies.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If that writ of error were here, a simpler and more obvious course would be, to move to dismiss it. But the judgment below was rendered since the commencement of the present term of this court, and the writ is returnable to the next term, when the office will have nearly expired.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If it be clear that no writ of error lies, it would seem to be a singular defect in the law, if the successful party below can be practically and absolutely defeated of his right by the suing out of such writ. With a court below, scrupulous of deciding, in the first instance, the question of the jurisdiction of this court, it would be easy to imagine examples and to put cases where the cause of justice would be entirely perverted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I propose, then, to show that there is no supersedeas, because no writ of error lies in such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It professes to be sued out under the act of April 2, 1816, (3 Stat., 261.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The section has been already recited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Its language does not differ substantially from that of the 22d section of the act of 1789.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So far as it differs at all, it is more stringent and explicit. The original act was that of 27th February, 1801, (2 Stat., 106,) which uses affirmative language, allowing appeals, &amp;c. This is negative, 'that no cause shall, &amp;c., unless, &amp;c.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is the 'matter in dispute' in this cause? And what is 'its value?'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a public office of personal trust and confidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not property in any sense of the term. It can neither be bought, nor sold, nor mortgaged, nor assigned. It cannot be aliened absolutely, or in any qualified form. It has none of the attributes which are inseparable from property. The proceeding below did not in any degree depend upon any profits to be earned in the office, or in any manner to arise out of it. The information would lie in the name of the United States, if the office were purely honorary, (as it is in effect, the salary being small,) it being an office of public trust, touching the rule and government of a city. It would lie as well on the relation of any private citizen and voter in the town, as on the relation of the true incumbent <i>de jure</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again: The record shows, by stipulation, that in fact there is an annual salary annexed to the office, payable month by month, as earned. This salary, if earned, for a whole year, would be one thousand dollars. Is a year's salary, or the salary for the whole term of two years, the matter in dispute here, or is the matter in dispute of that value? Clearly not. The judgment of ouster neither gives nor takes away the salary for the whole term, or for any part of it. When the information was filed, two months' salary had accrued; when the judgment was rendered, nine months' salary had accrued. During all this time, the defendant, as mayor <i>de facto</i>, received his salary, and the judgment could not deprive him of it. For the unexpired term, who will say, that if he be not ousted, he will live and earn the salary for any single month or day of it? And unless he live, and earn it, it matters not to him whether the judgment be reversed or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no value in dispute; for the services to be rendered by the defendant are to be taken as a full equivalent for the salary to be paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a wide difference between this case and that of a life estate in lands, or chattels, which, though it depend on life, is yet the subject of sale&#8212;is property&#8212;and its value in market may be ascertained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these principles in view, the following cases are referred to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ritchie <i>v.</i> Mauro, 2 Pet., 243.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barry <i>v.</i> Mercein, 5 How., 103.

(decided in 1822) has been steadily adhered to by the court upon the principal point determined by it, and the only one which appears to have been argued, viz: that a judgment for mandamus is a final judgment. It was cited and reaffirmed for the purpose in the case of United States <i>v.</i> Kendall, and in the case of Holmes <i>v.</i> Jennison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having decided this point, the court directed the counsel for the plaintiff in error to produce affidavits of the value of the salary attached to the offices of directors of the company. But upon the production of them, the writ was quashed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of Mauro <i>v.</i> Ritchie, 2 Peters, (1829,) the very question of value was the whole question. The court there, instead of directing affidavits, lay down the principle that an office which is of no value except so far as it affords compensation for labor and services, thereafter to be earned, is not the subject of a writ of error from the Circuit Court of this District.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And as to the case of Lee <i>v.</i> Lee, it is an exceptional case, which does not seem to be reconcilable with the uniform current of decisions in this court. It was decided in 1834, and there is only one member of the court (Mr. Justice McLean) who was then on the bench, and he appears to have concurred in its decision of Barry <i>v.</i> Mercein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is curious to contrast the conclusion announced in the case of Lee <i>v.</i> Lee with that of the latter case. In the former. the court took jurisdiction because liberty was 'not susceptible of pecuniary estimation;' in the latter they disclaimed it, because the paternal rights, duties, and affections, were in like manner 'utterly incapable of being reduced to any pecuniary standard of value, as it rises superior to money considerations.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Bradley</i> made the following points:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The office of mayor of Georgetown is elective for two years; the salary is fixed by law at $1,000 a year, payable monthly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.
