Since the death of Francisco de Haro, it has been occupied, and is still, by the tenants of his heirs. Dolores and Centre streets have always existed, since the mission was established, but had not their present names; in fact, they had no names. This lot in question had the same position that it now has; a surveyor, without any difficulty, could locate said lot.</p>\n<p>The witness says that he has lived at the mission Dolores for the last sixteen years, and has seen all that he has testified to.</p>\n<p>The final decree of the Circuit Court before both the judges was as follows:</p>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard upon the transcript of the proceedings in the board of the United States land commissioners, &amp;c., and upon the proof taken in this court upon the appeal from the decision of the said board, taken therefrom by the complainant; and upon hearing counsel for appellants and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*297</span> respondent, and due deliberation being thereupon had, &amp;c., it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the decision and decree of the said board be, and the same hereby is, reversed.</p>\n<p>And it is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the claim of the said appellants to the land claimed by them is valid, and that the same be, and hereby is, confirmed to them.</p>\n<p>The land whereof confirmation is made is that certain fifty-vara lot, situated in the mission Dolores, on the northeast corner of what are known as Centre and Dolores streets, on which lot there is a house which formerly formed a part of the establishment of the mission Dolores, occupied by the mayor domos thereof  said lot fronting on the plaza, opposite to the principal house of said mission, and which lot was in the occupancy of Francisco de Haro for some years previous to his death, and has been recently in the possession of one Louis Pruso, as tenant of the claimant, together with and adding fifty varas to the eastward and immediately adjoining said houses.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, a notice was served on the district attorney, that the counsel for the complainants will move the court, on the 14th of September, 1857, on that day, or as soon thereafter as counsel can be heard, that the decree entered in this cause be reformed, by adding to the description of the property confirmed by the said decree, \"together with the parcel of land, fifty varas square, to the eastward thereof. San Francisco, September 10th, 1857.\"</p>\n<p>Afterwards, on motion of the district attorney of the United States, \"it is ordered that the decree heretofore rendered at this term in the above case be set aside, and that the cause stand for reargument at the next term of this court.\"</p>\n<p>And the final entry, upon filing and reading the affidavit of B.S. Brooks, and upon inspection of a traced copy of the original grant of title, whereof confirmation was heretofore made, certified in due form from the office of the surveyor general, from which it manifestly appears to the court that the said grant was originally made and dated by Governor <span class=\"star-pagination\">*298</span> Alvarado during his term of office, and that the date which it now bears is an evident alteration against the interests of the claimants, and therefore not to be imputed to them; and upon filing a notice of motion and due proof of service thereof upon the district attorney of the United States, and counsel having been heard for both parties, on motion of Mr. Williams, of counsel for the claimants, it is ordered that the order heretofore made in this cause, setting aside and vacating the decree heretofore made confirming the claim, be, and the same is hereby, vacated, set aside, and annulled, and said decree revived and reinstated.</p>\n<p>From this decree there was an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States by the Government.</p>\n<p>\"It appears that an undisturbed possession of the property claimed has been in the possession of Francisco de Haro and his heirs sixteen years, and it does not appear that any one has claimed or exercised a possession or right of possession over the premises. The copy of the original grant of title, whereof confirmation was heretofore made, certified in due form from the office of the surveyor general, from which it manifestly appears to the court that the said grant was originally made and dated by Governor Alvarado during his term of office, and the date which it now bears is an evident alteration against the interests of the claimants, and therefore not to be imputed to them.\" This, being the language of the court, imparts verity to the grant, and would seem to settle all doubt on the subject.</p>\n<p>There were some old houses on the land at the time of the grant, which belonged to the mission, but it would seem no longer belong to it.</p>\n<p>Upon the whole, we cannot doubt, from the title papers, and especially from the sixteen years' possession which has been enjoyed by De Haro and his heirs  using the property as their own, claiming it under the grant  that the title should be confirmed; and it is hereby confirmed.</p>\n</div>", "id": 87291, "judges": "McLean", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/87291/", "sha1": "7f47536696c2d7e0d388aaab26e2e62f9b198314", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:01:07"}
