The Circuit Court decreed against Fitch, who brought up this appeal.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was submitted on printed arguments by <i>Mr. Cooke</i> for the appellant, and <i>Mr. Swayne</i> for the appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal question in the case was whether the Circuit Court had jurisdiction of the case, which depended upon the facts involved in it. A particular statement of these would not be interesting to the profession generally, and therefore they are omitted. The propositions for which <i>Mr. Cooke</i> contended, in support of the demurrer below, were&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I. That the complainant does not show himself possessed of any right which he can enforce directly against this defendant or his property; and&#8212;&#8212;II. That the liability of the defendant is not such an one as can be enforced against him in a court of equity, without the aid of the statute, which cannot confer jurisdiction upon the courts of the United States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Swayne's</i> points, in opposition to the above, were thus stated:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I. It seems to be conceded that, when the local statutes of a State give rights to an individual, the courts of the United States will enforce those rights in case where they have jurisdiction of the parties.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. It is not pretended that the States can direct the remedy by which rights are to be enforced, which the Federal courts are bound to pursue.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. But it is claimed that where the statute of a State creates a right which may be enforced by remedies already existing and resorted to in the latter courts, that these courts will enforce the right by their own known remedies and usages, in cases where they have jurisdiction, although the local state may direct a special mode of proceeding.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The General Smith, 4 Wheaton's Rep., 438.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. By the statute and the contract with the city, the complainant acquired, by operation of law, rights which courts of equity, by their long-established rules and usages, will enforce.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice McLEAN delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United States for the northern district of Ohio.

The assessments, too, were made to Creighton, and he was considered the only contractor with the city. No right was held under Connelly. By the statute the city makes an assessment which is to be paid by the owner personally, and it is also made a lien on the property charged. The charge may be collected and the lien enforced by a proceeding at law or in equity, either in the name of the city or its appointee.
