Beacham, George P. Beacham, Lenox Beacham, and Samuel Beacham, partners trading as A. Flanigan &amp; Co., against Robert Turner, owner of the steamboat Susquehannah, in the District Court of the United States for the district of Maryland. The libellants claimed $2,762 for work done and materials furnished in repairs to the Susquehannah at the request of Turner, who was either owner or agent for the owner. Turner answered that Flanigan &amp; Co. were joint owners of the boat with him and others, and, therefore, had no right to recover against him for the work. He also alleged and showed that a bill was pending in a State court, brought by himself against these libellants and others, to dissolve the partnership, sell the vessel, and after paying expenses, &amp;c., divide the proceeds ratably among the several owners. This cause was then suspended until that in the State court should be decided. The last mentioned proceeding went on, the vessel was sold under it, and Turner claimed the proceeds as sole owner; the other parties consented, and the court so ordered. The present cause was then pressed in the District Court, and a decree made there in favor of the libellants for the amount found to be due for their work and materials&#8212;$2,665 73, with interest from 1st July, 1857, and costs. Turner, the respondent, appealed to the Circuit Court, where the decree was changed to $2,827 88. Turner appealed to the Supreme Court, and attempted to reverse the decree of the Circuit Court upon the grounds which will be found stated in the opinion of Judge <i>Nelson</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Barrol</i>, of Maryland, for respondent.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Perrine</i>, of Maryland, for libellants.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice NELSON.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an appeal from a decree in admiralty of the Circuit Court of the United States for the district of Maryland.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The libel was filed by the appellees against Turner, the appellant, <i>in personam</i>, for materials and repairs on the steamboat Susquehannah, in the port of Baltimore.
