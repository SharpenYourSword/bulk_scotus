Caldwell, one of the banking firm testifies that it was under the instruction and at the request of defendant that he drew on plaintiff for the money; that, in doing so, he acted solely for defendant; and that, on the day of the date of the draft, he permitted defendant to check against this money on his bank for the sum of $250; and that, in all, defendant checked on him against that fund for over $800.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The clerk and bookkeeper of Caldwell &amp; Co. testifies that, on the day the draft was drawn, defendant was credited on their books for $2,000 on account of said draft, and that he continued to draw it out by checks, until they amounted to over $800 at the day of their failure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pass book of plaintiff with Caldwell &amp; Co. is produced by himself, and shows a credit of $2,000 dated August 30th; but as this was some time after their failure, and after they had had this pass book in their hands, it is evidently a mistake as to date. The clerk above mentioned says it was intended for August 1st, as the arrangement was made on Saturday, July 30th, after banking hours, and it was his custom to carry such transactions on the books of the next business day. This explanation seems reasonable, and, as he swears that it conforms to the memorandum on his blotter, we see no reason to doubt it. The checks are shown which defendant drew between July 30th and August 9th, and it is not denied that, unless drawn against this money, the defendant was overdrawing his account.
