It is sufficient to say that we are satisfied that the petitioner has presented a case calling for the exercise of the supervisory power of this court over the Circuit Court, which can only be made effectual by a writ of mandamus. A writ of mandamus will therefore issue from this court, directed to the judges of the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Wisconsin, commanding them to proceed with the execution of the order of that court of July 18, 1865.</p>\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "", "id": 2620746, "judges": "Miller Now, May 16th, 1867", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2620746/", "sha1": "959ef52ea7478dc04491aa1018be478a1bc87ab0", "source": "L", "time_retrieved": "2013-11-01T11:35:51.096926"}
