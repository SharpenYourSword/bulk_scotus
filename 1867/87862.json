In the meantime, to wit, on the 15th July, 1862, Congress, by an act of that date, had established a Circuit Court for the district of Wisconsin, whereby all causes then pending in the District Court, which might have been brought, or which could have been originally cognizable in a Circuit Court, were transferred to the Circuit Court; and the District Court was deprived of all Circuit-Court powers. The marshal therefore returned the report of his sale into the Circuit Court. This was on the 6th day of October, 1862.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After several orders partially confirming the sale, the Circuit Court, January 17th, 1863, set it aside, and ordered the marshal to sell again according to the original decree. On the 25th of April, thereafter, the marshal made another sale.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress, however, on the 3d March, 1863, had passed a statute authorizing the District Courts where they had rendered final judgments or decrees, prior to the act of July 15th, 1862, in cases which might have been brought, and could have been originally cognizable in a Circuit Court, 'to issue writs of execution or other final process, or to use such other powers and proceedings as might be in accordance with law, to enforce the judgments and decrees aforesaid.' Acting under this law, the marshal reported this sale to the District Court, and that court made an order of confirmation. The appellants here, applied to the Circuit Court for a rule on the marshal to make a report of his sale to that court, which application was refused.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They now appealed from these orders of the Circuit and District Courts, and sought their reversal, on the ground that the District Court had no power to act in the matter of the confirmation of the sale, and that it properly belonged to the Circuit Court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Messrs.

We have, on a former occasion, given a construction of that act from which we see no reason to depart. In the case, <i>Bronson</i> v. <i>La Crosse Railroad Co.</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> we held that the powers conferred by this act on the District Courts, were only such as were necessary to control the ministerial duties of officers in the execution of final powers; and that if other powers became necessary, recourse must be had to the Circuit Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The act of confirming or setting aside a sale made by a commissioner in chancery, often involves the exercise of judgment and discretion as delicate as that called for by any function which belongs to the court. In the case before us, over forty exceptions were taken to the marshal's report of the sale, by three different parties, who resisted its confirmation; and the court delivered an elaborate opinion on the matter involved in these exceptions, when they were under consideration on the first sale.
