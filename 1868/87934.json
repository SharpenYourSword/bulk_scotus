It appears from the record that the writ of error was duly issued; that a bond for prosecution of the writ was executed; that the sureties made oath to their sufficiency before E. D. Shattuck, chief justice of Oregon; that the citation in error was signed by the same judge; and that all these things were done on the same day, namely, the 8th of October, 1866. The law requires that the judge signing the citation shall take good and sufficient security. This, doubtless, is equivalent to a provision that the judge shall approve the bond But no particular form of approval is required. Approva may be inferred from the facts of the transaction.
