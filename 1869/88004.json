The defendant, the Railroad Company, denied the allegation of his right of possession. It set up no title in itself. The case went to trial upon the issue so made, and a judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff. The Railroad Company brought the case into this court by a writ of error. The judgment was reversed, and a mandate was sent to the court whence the cause came, commanding it 'to enter judgment for the defendant below.'

At the October Term, 1863, on his motion, the suit was dismissed, and a judgment was rendered against him for costs. At the December Term, 1863, of this court, a writ of mandamus was issued, whereby the court below was commanded to vacate the order granting a new trial, and to enter a judgment in favor of the Railroad Company, according to the mandate sent down upon the reversal of the judgment. The Circuit Court, at the October Term, 1864, did accordingly vacate the order granting a new trial.
