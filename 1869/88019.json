Captain Meigs was appointed to superintend the work.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January, 1854, Captain Meigs, on behalf of the United States, entered into a contract with Degges &amp; Smith, by which they agreed to furnish for the work a certain number of bricks, for which the United States agreed to pay at a specified rate per thousand. To secure performance, Degges &amp; Smith gave bond, with Mechlin &amp; Alexander as sureties.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contract between Captain Meigs and Degges &amp; Smith contained a provision <i>that neither the contract, nor any part of it, should be 'sub-let or assigned</i>.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March, 1855, Congress having appropriated a certain sum for continuing the work, Captain Meigs gave notice to Degges &amp; Smith, and also to their sureties, Mechlin &amp; Alexander, that there would be required for the work of that season, a portion of the bricks. To this notice Degges &amp; Smith made no response, but abandoned their undertaking, and failed to comply with their contract.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Degges &amp; Smith having thus made default, Mechlin &amp; Alexander, in order to save themselves from prosecution on their bond, entered into an arrangement with Captain Meigs, by which <i>they</i> assumed the contract which had been made with Degges &amp; Smith.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mechlin &amp; Alexander, accordingly, made preparations for the manufacture of the bricks necessary to fulfil their contract; but before completing their arrangements, <i>they</i>, in March, 1856, entered into a contract with one Kellogg, by which <i>he</i> undertook to furnish all the bricks required, and to receive payment therefor from the United States at the contract price, and to pay over to Mechlin &amp; Alexander, 5 per cent. of the amount so received; and Mechlin &amp; Alexander by deed constituted him <i>their lawful attorney to furnish the bricks, and to receive payment therefor</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kellogg continued to furnish bricks, <i>as the agent of Mechlin &amp; Alexander</i>, during the summer of 1856, until what remained of the appropriations for the building of the aqueduct was exhausted, when he received notice from Captain Meigs not to make or deliver any more.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the 3d of March, Congress passed a joint resolution, containing a proposition to '<i>all parties respectively interested on account of their contract</i> for manufacturing bricks for the Washington aqueduct,' that, if they would cancel it, the United States would settle with them, 'on the principles of justice and equity, all damages, losses, and liabilities incurred by said parties respectively on account of their contract.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the passage of this resolution, Mechlin &amp; Alexander, and Kellogg, also accepted the proposition, and cancelled the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon this, the Secretary of the Treasury proceeded to make the settlement contemplated by said joint resolution, and awarded to Mechlin &amp; Alexander, <i>as the only persons included in the provisions of the resolution</i>, $29,534. Of the sum so awarded by the secretary to Mechlin &amp; Alexander, Kellogg, accepting it under protest, received $10,476, as the amount he was entitled to receive under his contract with Mechlin &amp; Alexander.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kellogg now filed his petition in the court below, setting forth the facts above stated, and insisting that the award of the said sum of money to Mechlin &amp; Alexander, and the exclusion of him from the benefits of the resolution by the secretary, was erroneous, and contrary to the intent of the resolution; and that the secretary should have awarded him, as the amount he was entitled to receive under the resolution, as 'a party interested in said contract,' the sum of $62,692; to recover which sum and interest, amounting in all to $91,389, the suit was instituted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this petition the United States demurred; and the demurrer having been sustained by the Court of Claims and the petition dismissed, the case was now here on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Messrs.
