Judgment was given in favor of Gilmore by the Court of Claims, and the United States appealed.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sum in controversy, in the particular case, was insignificant, but the principle involved extended to numerous claims and large amounts.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Chipman, for the appellant; Mr. Dickey, Assistant Attorney-General, contra</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was for many years the practice in the army to detail enlisted men as personal servants of officers, and the practice had the sanction of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1812, with a view undoubtedly to the discouragement of this practice, it was provided by the act of July 6th,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> that 'officers who shall not take waiters from the line of the army shall receive the pay, clothing, and subsistence allowed to a private soldier, for as many waiters as they may actually keep, not exceeding the number allowed by existing regulations.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1816, the practice was absolutely prohibited except to company officers, and it was again provided, by the act of April 24th,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> almost in the terms of the act of 1812, that 'all officers be allowed for each private servant actually kept in service, not exceeding the number authorized by existing regulations, the pay, rations, and clothing of a private soldier, or money in lieu thereof, on a certificate setting forth the name and description of the servant in the pay account.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the passage of the last act, the pay of a private was five dollars a month, with rations and clothing of certain money value in addition.
