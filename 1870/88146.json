They had been passed at former terms, and early at this one. It being alleged by Mr. Hoar, Attorney-General, that they involved a question of public interest to wit, the legal tender question&#8212;which he desired, for some reasons which he stated, to have passed on anew, he asked the court to fix a day at this term for argument upon them, it being stated by him that it was, in his opinion, most desirable that the matter should not be postponed to the next term. After opposition and some delays by <i>Messrs. Carlisle and Merryman, for the appellants respectively</i>, who denied that any question of legal tender was presented in the records, and asserted that the cases, whenever called, had been passed, on an understanding by themselves, the counsel of the government, and the court, that if any such question were properly in them it should abide the decision to be made in <i>Hepburn</i> v. <i>Griswold</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> then under consideration by the court&#8212;a day was fixed for the hearing of the cases.
