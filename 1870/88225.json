The object of the suit as amended was to reform this confirmation, correct this supposed mistake, and and obtain a decree in favor of the persons claiming under <i>Joseph</i> Lacroix for the title which the defendant, Carpenter, had procured from the heirs of Louis Lacroix. The St. Louis Land Court gave judgment in favor of the plaintiff; and the Supreme Court of Missouri having affirmed the judgment, the other side brought the case here.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Britton Hill moved to dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction</i>, assuming, as the defendant claimed under the government of the United States, and as his title had been decided against, that the case came within the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Messrs.
