The bill charged that Mann had defrauded the bank of $20,000, and that the money itself, or the property in which it had been invested, had been converted into certain real estate, the legal title of which then stood in the name of his wife, and it prayed for a decree against Mann for the $20,000, with interest, and against him and his wife, that the real estate might be subjected to the payment of the debt.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants answered with similar fulness and minuteness, and issue was joined; the questions <i>involved being questions of pure fact without any question of law whatever</i>. Much testimony was taken, and a decree rendered that Mann was liable for the money, and that the real estate should be sold to pay it. This decree was carried into effect by a sale of the property, and about four years after the defendants prayed an appeal to this court.
