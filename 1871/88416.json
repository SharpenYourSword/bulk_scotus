That court dismissed the libel; but, on appeal, the Circuit Court reversed the decree and sent the case to a master, to report the amount due. The master, on the 15th July, 1868, reported $1982. The Circuit Court confirmed the report, and on the 11th February, 1870, decreed in favor of the libellant for the amount reported, <i>with interest from the date of the report</i>.
