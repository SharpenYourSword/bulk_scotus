This patent of Newton's had cutters of the same general shape and form, including circular base, as the saw-teeth of the other patent, attachable to a circular disk, and removable as in the other, but attached by screws or nuts, and the <i>claim or purpose of the Newton patent was for cutting tongues and grooves, mortices, &amp;c.</i> In connection with the offer of the patent to Newton, the defendant offered to prove by experts that the process of Newton's patent, and of the machine made thereunder, and of the result produced thereby, were the same process, machine, and result as were involved in the patent of the plaintiff; that saws were made under Newton's patent, and were in practical operation (the exhibition of the saws so made and operated being also offered); that the machine made under Newton's patent rotated in precisely the same manner and with the same effect as a circular saw, and that what in Newton's patent were designated 'cutters,' performed the same functions as the detachable teeth, described in the plaintiff's patent, and accomplished the same result; and that the said 'cutters' were nothing in reality but detachable saw-teeth, inserted on circular lines, and rounded at the base and inserted in circular sockets, and secured an equal distribution of the pressure on the said 'cutters,' over and upon the circular sockets in which they were set, and thus prevented fracture of the disk or plate.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court refused to admit the patent to Newton in evidence. Verdict and judgment were rendered accordingly for the plaintiff, Spalding, and the other party brought the case here on error, assigning several errors in the rejection of evidence and in the charge of the court.
