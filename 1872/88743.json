About five years next previous to the sale now spoken of, they all moved to the house in which they were living at the time of this sale. When they moved into this house Downing furnished a part of it, and Massey a part; Downing furnishing the articles which were the subject of this sale, and which were principally furniture for the parlor, library, dining-room, halls, and stairways. Both families used and occupied the parlor, library, and dining-room alike, and made equal use of the furniture of these rooms. Massey did the marketing and paid the bills for household expenses, and attended to matters about the house; he and Downing making settlements from time to time and dividing the household expenses between them.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the sale Downing and Mrs. Massey went around and looked at the different articles of furniture, took an inventory of it, agreed upon the price; and completed the transaction by Downing turning over to her the furniture, and executing and delivering to her a bill of sale duly acknowledged before a notary public. After the sale both families continued to occupy the house and use the furniture as before; the furniture, however, being subject to the absolute and sole control of Mrs. Massey.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently to this sale Downing was decreed a bankrupt, one Allen being appointed his assignee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hereupon Allen filed a bill in the court below against Massey, his wife, and Downing, to have the sale annulled, and the property given up to him the assignee. The District Court rendered a decree to that effect. This decree being affirmed by the Circuit Court, the defendants brought the case here.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. I. M.
