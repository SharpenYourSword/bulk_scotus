D. 1860. When the coupons fell due, the amount was tendered in the legal-tender notes of the United States, issued under the act of Congress of February 25th, 1862, and the several acts in addition thereto, and they were refused. The State court rendered judgment that this tender was not good, and that the plaintiff should receive the amount with interest in the gold and silver coin of the United States. This writ of error was brought to reverse that judgment.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. J. Halsey, for the plaintiff in error.
