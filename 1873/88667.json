Seizure was made by the deputy collector, and he delivered the casks as seized to the marshal. Subsequently, to wit, on the tenth of June in the same year, the district attorney filed an information against the property seized, praying process against the property, and that the same might be condemned as forfeited, which information sets forth the following causes of forfeiture: (1.) That the spirits were found at the place aforesaid in the control of J. H. Garnhart &amp; Co., holding the spirits with intent to sell the same in fraud of the internal revenue laws; that when found they were not in any distillery or distillery warehouse, or in transit to any bonded warehouse, or intended for transportation. (2.) That the spirits had been removed from some distillery or distillery warehouse without a permit and without paying or securing the payment of the tax imposed thereon, or giving bond for the removal thereof to any bonded warehouse, and without having been inspected, bonded, gauged, or stamped as required by law. (3.) That the casks containing the spirits were not stamped, marked, or branded as required by law. Process was requested, and it is not denied that it was issued and served, and the persons in whose possession the spirits were found appeared on the twenty-sixth of June next after the seizure and filed their claim to the property, in which they allege that they are the true and <i>bon a fide</i> owners of the ninety-six casks of distilled spirits, and it appears that they gave security for costs as required in such proceedings. Nothing further appears to have been done in the cause until the twenty-fifth of May, in the succeeding year, when the claimants appeared and filed an answer, in which they allege as follows: (1.) That they are the true and <i>bon a fide</i> owners of the property in controversy. (2.) That they admit that the spirits were seized as set forth in the information. (3.) That the charges and allegations contained in each of the first three paragraphs of the information, are untrue. (4.)
