It stipulated for the payment of that sum to the legal representatives of the assured, in the event of his death, from injuries effected through violent and accidental means; provided that the death was caused by an accident while the assured was 'travelling by public or private <i>conveyance</i>.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After purchasing the ticket, the insured proceeded by steamboat to a village about eight miles from his residence, and from that village he <i>walked</i> home. While on his way he received injuries by violence, from the effects of which he died soon afterwards, and within the time limited by the policy.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question was whether, when he received the injuries, he was 'travelling by public or private <i>conveyance</i>.' The court below held that he was not; and this holding was the error complained of.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Mr. George Gray, for the plaintiff in error:</i>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Northrup</i> v. <i>The Railway Passengers' Assurance Company</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the contract was against accident 'while travelling by public or private conveyance,' <i>provided for the transportation of its passengers</i>. Yet the company was held liable though the death was caused while the party was <i>walking</i> from a steamboat landing to a railway station, a distance of seventy rods. This case regards the walking as part of the original journey in the public or private conveyance, and wisely; for few persons on a long journey are all the time in the railcarriages. The case does but carry out the injunction given by Cockburn, C.J., in <i>Trew</i> v. <i>Railway Passengers' Assurance Company:</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'We ought not to give to these policies a construction which will defeat the protection of the assured in a large class of cases.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, independently of this. The words 'private conveyance,' reasonably, and <i>ex vi termini</i>, include the case of a person pursuing a journey, or travelling, by means of his own personal powers of locomotion; his limbs with their muscles and tendons, bones and joints&#8212;the primitive universal 'private conveyance' of man. 'Conveyance' is the instrument or means of carrying or transferring anything from place to place. It is derived from <i>con</i> (with, by, along), and <i>via</i> (the way).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> It is used in this sense in the Scriptures, where it is said that the Saviour had '<i>conveyed himself</i> away.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> So in poetry,</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Love cannot, like the wind, itself <i>convey</i> To fill two sails, though both are spread one way.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Howard</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And so in ordinary language and in everyday life. Should a court direct its officer to '<i>convey</i> the prisoner to jail,' no one will doubt that the prisoner's walking to the place designated would be a literal and exact compliance with the order. If one were to say to an intruder, '<i>Convey</i> yourself away,' the speaker would have no idea but that the party should walk off; nor would the party himself expect that anything else was meant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. H.
