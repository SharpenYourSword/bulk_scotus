On the 9th of that month&#8212;being 'a registered enemy' of the United States&#8212;a military order was issued that he should 'leave that parish for the so-called Confederacy before the 15th instant.' The order was obeyed. He proceeded to Mobile, and remained there until the capture of that place by the National forces in April, 1865. He thereupon returned immediately to New Orleans, and was not further molested there by the military authorities. The subjugation of the city of New Orleans by the forces of the United States became complete on the 6th of May, 1863. It remained thenceforward in their possession until the close of the insurrection. The absence of Lasere from New Orleans, like his departure, was enforced and involuntary. He intended to return, and, as soon as permitted to do so, did return and resume his residence. In the fall of 1863, after his expulsion, proceedings by executory process were instituted against him upon two mortgages for the seizure and sale of the mortgaged premises, consisting of a house and lot in New Orleans. The first order bears date on the 23d of November. On the 27th of that month the sheriff returned on the notice of demand of payment, that, 'after diligent search and inquiry,' he 'was informed' that Lasere had 'left the city and State without leaving an agent to represent him.' A curator <i>ad hoc</i> was thereupon appointed, but it does not appear that he took any action. 'After the legal delay had expired' the sheriff proceeded to advertise and sell the premises, and conveyed them to the purchaser. Lasere, after his return from Mobile, instituted the original cases to vacate those proceedings. They terminated in the adverse judgment which is before us for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is contrary to the plainest principles of reason and justice that any one should be condemned as to person or property without an opportunity to be heard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Scant time was allowed the plaintiff in error to prepare for his removal within the Confederate lines.
