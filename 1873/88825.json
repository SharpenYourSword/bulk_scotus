The prayer of the bill was for an account, for a decree requiring the company to pay the amount that should be found to be due to the complainant, for the foreclosure of the mortgage, and the sale of the mortgaged property.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The county of Limestone failed to appear, and a decree <i>pro confesso</i> was taken against it. 'The Nashville and Decatur Railroad Company' appeared, and demurred for want of proper parties and other causes. The court below overruled the demurrer, and considering, on certain pleas put in, that the case was with the complainant, decreed a sale of the road, &amp;c., unless, within a time named, the company paid the amount due on the complainant's bonds.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal here the question was whether the demurrer was rightfully overruled for want of proper parties.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. R. T.

The adequacy of the security of the mortgage for the payment of all the bonds purporting to be secured by it is quite doubtful. The fund is, to some extent, '<i>tabula in naufragio</i>.' It is the interest of every bondholder to diminish the debt of every other bondholder. In so far as he succeeds in doing that, he adds to his own security. Each holder, therefore, should be present, both that he may defend his own claims and that he may attack the other claims should there be just occasion for it. If upon a fair adjustment of the amount of the debts there should be a deficiency in the security, real or apprehended, every one interested should have notice in advance of the time, place, and mode of sale, that he may make timely arrangements to secure a sale of the property at its full value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2d.
