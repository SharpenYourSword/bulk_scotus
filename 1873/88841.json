To that judgment the county took this writ of error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. G. Koerner, for the plaintiff in error; Mr. W. H.

No judgment is final which does not terminate the litigation between the parties to the suit. The issue between the parties may be again tried in the Circuit Court, and another judgment may be recovered which may be removed to the Supreme Court for revision.
