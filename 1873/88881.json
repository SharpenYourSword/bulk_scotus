The act makes a provision, however, for the correction of unintentional error by application to the collector, and purchase of the proper stamp.

At times, as in the summer of 1864, one day in which it required $285 of notes to buy $100 of gold,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s\" id=\"fn-s-s_ref\">**</a> this difference has been immense; and it has been frequently great. Now, the question is, may parties at a time when gold and silver have in fact no currency&#8212;when the notes of the government are the sole currency of the country, or certainly of all that part of it where the parties to this transaction lived&#8212;may parties put in their deeds the value, in <i>gold</i>, of the property sold, and then pay stamps on that value? the real thing which passes between them being, all the while, not gold, but paper; not $13,000 in coin, but a greater amount in notes; more or less greater according as the discount on paper in the market may be higher or lower. We submit that they cannot, because a contrary rule will tend directly to frauds upon the revenue. In cases of large deeds or of large mortgages the temptation will be prevailing.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Mr. F. P.

The stamp affixed to the deed was then exactly what the law required. Supposing the plaintiffs in error honestly doubted this, they had it in their power to correct the supposed error by applying to the collector; and as it is evident no fraud was intended, the correction would have cost them fifty cents. It is apparent then, that the writ of error in this case, which has delayed the proceedings in the court below for two years and a half, was sued out 'merely for delay,' and comes strictly within the letter and spirit of the Twenty-third Rule of this court, which declares that 'in all cases where a writ of error . . . shall appear to have been sued out merely for delay, damages shall be awarded at the rate of ten per cent. per annum on the amount of the judgment.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, by the practice in Tennessee, a vendee must furnish deeds and stamps. In this proceeding, therefore, the plaintiffs in error are endeavoring to take advantage of their own wrong, as it was their duty to affix the proper stamp to the deed.
