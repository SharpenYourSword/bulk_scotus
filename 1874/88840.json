The bill assigned as a reason for its being filed by Dows, a stockholder in the company, instead of by the company itself, that the company neglected and refused to take action on the subject. A demurrer was interposed to the bill, which was overruled, and on the defendants refusing to answer over, the Circuit Court ordered that the collection of the tax be perpetually enjoined. From this, its action, the defendants appealed, insisting that the Circuit Court erred in overruling the demurrer, for three reasons:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>First</i>. Because the railroad company was not made a party to the bill.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Second</i>. Because the complainant had a complete remedy at law; and,</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Third</i>. Because the tax in question was a proper charge against the property of the corporation.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. J. N. Rogers, for the appellants; Mr. T. F. Witherow, contra</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice DAVIS delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unnecessary to notice the last two reason assigned, why the demurrer should not have been overruled, as the first is well taken. Indeed, it would be improper to pass on the merits of the controversy until the proper parties to be affected by the decision are before the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That a stockholder may bring a suit when a corporation refuses is settled in <i>Dodge</i> v. <i>Woolsey</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> but such a suit can only be maintained on the ground that the rights of the corporation are involved. These rights the individual shareholder is allowed to assert in behalf of himself and associates, because the directors of the corporation decline to take the proper steps to assert them. Manifestly the proceedings for this purpose should be so conducted that any decree which shall be made on the merits shall conclude the corporation. This can only be done by making the corporation a party defendant. The relief asked is on behalf of the corporation, not the individual shareholder, and if it be granted the complainant derives only an incidental benefit from it. It would be wrong, in case the shareholder were unsuccessful, to allow the corporation to renew the litigation in another suit, involving precisely the same subject-matter.
