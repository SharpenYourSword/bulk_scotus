The libellants, nevertheless, on the 14th, 15th, and 16th of May took their appeal with supersedeas to the Circuit Court, the Circuit Court, of course, for the District of <i>Alabama;</i> and on the appeal that court, holding that the credit had been to the vessel, reversed, January 11th, 1869, the decree of the District Court, and awarded to each of the libellants above-named the amount claimed by him, with interest at 8 per cent. from the 1st of August, 1867.

The libel reasserted the old liens for materials, asserted further a lien for $1767.62 for said <i>costs</i>, and prayed that the steamer 'be sold to satisfy the claims of the libellants in the sum of $1767.62, costs of the courts of <i>Alabama</i>, with also all costs in this behalf expended.'

The eighth rule of court requires that the clerk of the lower court shall make and transmit a true copy of the record and of all proceedings in the cause; this has not been done in the present case, but on the contrary, portions of the record, important to show the character of the seizure and condemnation of the Rio Grande in the several suits of the libellants, have by order of the claimants' proctor been excluded from the transcript.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2d. The decree of the Circuit Court for the District of Alabama was a separate decree for different sums of money, due to the different libellants as material-men against the vessel. None of these amounts, with the interest allowed, amounted at the time of the decree rendered to the sum of $2000, and unless the decree be for more than $2000 in favor of <i>each libellant</i> an appeal cannot lie, even though the aggregate amount exceeds that sum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And where joint libels <i>in rem</i> are filed for wages of seamen and for supplies, which make a lien on a vessel, the claims for wages and supplies do not become joint, but the decree rendered in favor of each libellant for the sum due him is a several decree, and cannot be appealed from by either libellant or claimant, unless the amount in dispute on each claim exceeds $2000, which amount in dispute as regards the claimant is shown by the decree rendered in favor of the libellant. This is settled in <i>Rich</i> v. <i>Lambert</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and in <i>Oliver</i> v. <i>Alexander</i>.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The separate character of the claims of the libellants was not changed or altered by their attempt to enforce the decree of the District Court of Alabama in the Admiralty Court of Louisiana by a joint libel. The sole purpose of the proceedings in Louisiana was to enforce the decree made in Alabama, and the proceedings in Louisiana are merely in the nature of an execution against the vessel. If the vessel or its claimants could not appeal from the decree of the Circuit Court in Alabama, no appeal from proceedings to execute that decree will lie from the decree of the Circuit Court in Louisiana, although the vessel may have been removed from one jurisdiction to another, or have changed owners. The removal or change of ownership cannot affect the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But if the amount claimed in the libel in Louisiana is to govern the appellate jurisdiction, then the claim of William Otis alone, under that ruling, will be subject to appeal, all the others being for sums below the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Mr. D.

The clerk of the Circuit Court has omitted many important documents which he was not instructed to omit, but the agreement of the counsel about perfecting and completing the transcript, estops from asking a dismissal on that ground. It has been abandoned by the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. This appeal is from the Circuit Court for Louisiana, not from the Circuit Court for Alabama; and the decree appealed from was made March 3d, 1871. Now, as Otis claimed $1508, and as Lyons &amp; Keyland claimed $1411.83, and as the decree appealed from, made, as just said, March 3d, 1871, allows them those sums, with interest at 8 p. c. from the 1st day of August, 1867, that is to say, for five years, seven months, and three days, computation will show that, as respects each of those two libellants at least, the matter in controversy does exceed $2000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> On such a case, no motion 'to dismiss the appeal,' that is, to dismiss it <i>in toto</i>, can be granted. The most that could be asked for would be some action in regard to the minor claimants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But none can be asked for in regard to them. There was but one libel filed in the District Court for Louisiana, and that was a joint libel. That joint proceeding was quite unlike the separate proceedings in the District Court for Alabama.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Alabama the libellants were seeking to enforce their several claims against the Rio Grande for supplies; in Louisiana they sought to enforce the execution of a decree which awarded to them not only the amounts originally claimed by them, but also a sum of $1767.62 for costs. And in their libel in Louisiana the libellants asked that the steamer be 'sold to satisfy the claims of your libellants, with the sum of $1767.62, <i>costs of the courts of Alabama</i>, with <i>also</i> all costs in this behalf expended.' And the decree did award to the libellants the amount thus claimed by them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The costs thus awarded are not embraced within the exception of the law ('except costs') in computing the amount in dispute. The only costs that are not to be included in the computation are the costs in the proceedings actually carried on in the courts in <i>Louisiana</i>, to secure an adjudication of the rights of the libellants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, touching the amount of these former costs the libellants were joint suitors, not joint and several; they claimed that sum conjointly, and it was thus awarded to them by the decree appealed from. What portion of this sum of $1767 is coming to Otis, or what to Hastings, or what to any of the libellants, the decree does not determine. The sum constitutes a <i>common fund</i> to be distributed among the libellants, and, <i>quoad</i> that amount, brings the case strictly within the rule laid down in <i>Shields</i> v. <i>Thomas</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> a case in which the cases of <i>Rich</i> v. <i>Lambert</i> and <i>Oliver</i> v. <i>Alexander</i>, cited by the opposing counsel, are reviewed, and in which the distinction which we contend for is recognized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, if such be the case, the appellant cannot be protected against execution for this whole sum of $1767, unless the appeal is maintained against all the libellants. Suppose the appeal to be dismissed as to Hastings, Hastings can issue his execution for the amount awarded to him and the $1767. Opposing counsel will agree to this. And this shows that the libellants are joint libellants to enforce the execution of 'a decree' in their favor; and <i>not joint and several</i> libellants for the sums claimed. Indeed, having filed their libel in the form in which they have consented to do, they could not be heard to say that they were joint and several libellants for a part of their claim and joint libellants only for another part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In so far as the appellant is concerned, it is a matter of indifference how the whole amount claimed is distributed. That is a matter to be settled between the material-men (the appellees) themselves. At present, in the libel in Louisiana, the decree on which alone it is that there is an appeal, they claim jointly. And, so claiming, it is unimportant that the claims of particular claimants are less than $2000, the claim of all exceeding that sum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice CLIFFORD delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Separate libels were filed by the appellees, in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Alabama, against the steamboat Rio Grande, to enforce the payment of certain claims made by those parties against the steamboat for materials furnished for repairs and for necessary supplies, which it is alleged constituted a maritime lien upon the steamboat. Process was issued and served and the parties appeared and were heard, and the decree states that the court ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the claims contained in the libels in this cause do not constitute such a maritime lien as to give the court jurisdiction, and the court entered a decree that the libel in each case be dismissed with costs. Immediate application was made to the court by the claimants for an order that the possession of the steamboat should be delivered to them by the marshal, and the record shows that on the twelfth of May, 1868, the motion was granted. Notice of appeal was immediately given by the libellants, and two days after the order was passed delivering the steamboat to the trustees named in the application for the order, the appeal bonds were filed. During the pendency of the several libels in the District Court and before the final decree, to wit, on the tenth of December, 1867, the causes were consolidated by the court upon a written agreement being filed that the consolidation should not prejudice the officers of the court in respect to costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the eighth of June, 1871, the same material-men filed a libel in the District Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana, against the same steamboat, to enforce the maritime lien for the same claims, in which they alleged that during the pendency of the said admiralty proceedings in the District Court for the Southern District of Alabama, the court there ordered the marshal to deliver the possession of the same, as in the order previously described, and that the order was executed as made, notwithstanding the libellants appealed and gave appeal bonds operating as a supersedeas within the period allowed by law for perfecting such appeals. Process was issued and served and the appellants appeared as claimants and filed an answer. Testimony was taken, and the parties having been heard, the court entered a decree dismissing the libel, and the libellants appealed to the Circuit Court, where the parties were again heard, and the Circuit Court reversed the decree of the District Court and entered a decree that the libellants do have and recover from the steamboat the following sums, to wit: William Otis, $1508; Lyons &amp; Keyland, $1411.83; Joseph Hastings, $83.75; R. D. Port &amp; Co., 121.25; G. B. &amp; C. B. Gwin &amp; Co., $713.14, with eight per cent. interest on said different amounts, from the first of August, 1867, until paid, and costs of suit as therein specified. By the record it appears that the decree was entered on the first day of March, 1873, and of course five years and seven months' interest must be added to each of the several sums awarded in the decree. Whereupon the respondents appealed to this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two grounds for dismissing the appeal are set forth in the motion under consideration:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1st. That the transcript does not contain a true copy of the record and of all the proceedings in the case, under the hand and seal of the Circuit Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2d.

Probably the stipulation filed in the case allowing the appellants to complete and perfect the transcript in the case may be regarded as an answer to the first ground of the motion, but if not it is quite clear that the certificate of the clerk of the court must be regarded as <i>prim a facie</i> evidence that the matter of fact alleged in the motion is not well founded. Deficiencies, if any, may be supplied by <i>certiorari</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Nor can the motion be sustained for the other reason set forth, as it is certain that the decree against the appellants here in favor of two of the respective appellees exceeds the sum of $2000. True, the sums recovered by the other three appellees respectively were not sufficient to give this court jurisdiction, but the motion is to dismiss the appeal, which must be denied, as the decree in favor of the two libellants first named in the decree is, as it respects each of those, greater than $2000, when the interest allowed by the Circuit Court to the date of the decree is included with the principal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Interest to that date being specifically allowed by the decree must be included with the principal in order to determine what 'the sum or value in dispute was' at the time the appeal was taken and allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MOTION DENIED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 12 Howard, 347.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> 6 Peters, 143.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The Patapsco, 12 Wallace, 451.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Lee <i>v.</i> Watson, 1 Wallace, 337.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> 17 Howard, 3.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The Patapsco, 12 Wallace, 451.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "", "html_with_citations": "<p class=\"case_cite\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></span></p>\n    <p class=\"case_cite\">22 L.Ed. 60</p>\n    <p class=\"case_cite\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></span></p>\n    <p class=\"parties\">THE RIO GRANDE.</p>\n    <p class=\"date\">October Term, 1873</p>\n    <div class=\"prelims\">\n      <p class=\"indent\">APPEAL from the Circuit Court for the District of <i>Louisiana;</i> the case being thus:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Judiciary Act as amended by an act of 1803 gives appeals to this court from the Circuit Courts in admiralty causes, 'where the matter in dispute exceeds the sum or value of $2000, <i>exclusive of costs</i>.'These provisions of law being in force, the steamer Rio Grande, owned, as was alleged, by persons in Mexico, being in the port of Mobile, in the <i>Southern District of Alabama</i>, certain material-men, on the 26th of November, 1867, filed separate libels against her in the District Court for the said district.

The libellants, nevertheless, on the 14th, 15th, and 16th of May took their appeal with supersedeas to the Circuit Court, the Circuit Court, of course, for the District of <i>Alabama;</i> and on the appeal that court, holding that the credit had been to the vessel, reversed, January 11th, 1869, the decree of the District Court, and awarded to each of the libellants above-named the amount claimed by him, with interest at 8 per cent. from the 1st of August, 1867.

None of these amounts, with the interest allowed, amounted at the time of the decree rendered to the sum of $2000, and unless the decree be for more than $2000 in favor of <i>each libellant</i> an appeal cannot lie, even though the aggregate amount exceeds that sum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And where joint libels <i>in rem</i> are filed for wages of seamen and for supplies, which make a lien on a vessel, the claims for wages and supplies do not become joint, but the decree rendered in favor of each libellant for the sum due him is a several decree, and cannot be appealed from by either libellant or claimant, unless the amount in dispute on each claim exceeds $2000, which amount in dispute as regards the claimant is shown by the decree rendered in favor of the libellant. This is settled in <i>Rich</i> v. <i>Lambert</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and in <i>Oliver</i> v. <i>Alexander</i>.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The separate character of the claims of the libellants was not changed or altered by their attempt to enforce the decree of the District Court of Alabama in the Admiralty Court of Louisiana by a joint libel. The sole purpose of the proceedings in Louisiana was to enforce the decree made in Alabama, and the proceedings in Louisiana are merely in the nature of an execution against the vessel. If the vessel or its claimants could not appeal from the decree of the Circuit Court in Alabama, no appeal from proceedings to execute that decree will lie from the decree of the Circuit Court in Louisiana, although the vessel may have been removed from one jurisdiction to another, or have changed owners. The removal or change of ownership cannot affect the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But if the amount claimed in the libel in Louisiana is to govern the appellate jurisdiction, then the claim of William Otis alone, under that ruling, will be subject to appeal, all the others being for sums below the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Mr. D. C. Labatt, contra, for the appellants:</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The clerk of the Circuit Court has omitted many important documents which he was not instructed to omit, but the agreement of the counsel about perfecting and completing the transcript, estops from asking a dismissal on that ground. It has been abandoned by the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. This appeal is from the Circuit Court for Louisiana, not from the Circuit Court for Alabama; and the decree appealed from was made March 3d, 1871. Now, as Otis claimed $1508, and as Lyons &amp; Keyland claimed $1411.83, and as the decree appealed from, made, as just said, March 3d, 1871, allows them those sums, with interest at 8 p. c. from the 1st day of August, 1867, that is to say, for five years, seven months, and three days, computation will show that, as respects each of those two libellants at least, the matter in controversy does exceed $2000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> On such a case, no motion 'to dismiss the appeal,' that is, to dismiss it <i>in toto</i>, can be granted. The most that could be asked for would be some action in regard to the minor claimants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But none can be asked for in regard to them. There was but one libel filed in the District Court for Louisiana, and that was a joint libel. That joint proceeding was quite unlike the separate proceedings in the District Court for Alabama.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Alabama the libellants were seeking to enforce their several claims against the Rio Grande for supplies; in Louisiana they sought to enforce the execution of a decree which awarded to them not only the amounts originally claimed by them, but also a sum of $1767.62 for costs. And in their libel in Louisiana the libellants asked that the steamer be 'sold to satisfy the claims of your libellants, with the sum of $1767.62, <i>costs of the courts of Alabama</i>, with <i>also</i> all costs in this behalf expended.' And the decree did award to the libellants the amount thus claimed by them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The costs thus awarded are not embraced within the exception of the law ('except costs') in computing the amount in dispute. The only costs that are not to be included in the computation are the costs in the proceedings actually carried on in the courts in <i>Louisiana</i>, to secure an adjudication of the rights of the libellants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, touching the amount of these former costs the libellants were joint suitors, not joint and several; they claimed that sum conjointly, and it was thus awarded to them by the decree appealed from. What portion of this sum of $1767 is coming to Otis, or what to Hastings, or what to any of the libellants, the decree does not determine. The sum constitutes a <i>common fund</i> to be distributed among the libellants, and, <i>quoad</i> that amount, brings the case strictly within the rule laid down in <i>Shields</i> v. <i>Thomas</i>,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> a case in which the cases of <i>Rich</i> v. <i>Lambert</i> and <i>Oliver</i> v. <i>Alexander</i>, cited by the opposing counsel, are reviewed, and in which the distinction which we contend for is recognized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, if such be the case, the appellant cannot be protected against execution for this whole sum of $1767, unless the appeal is maintained against all the libellants. Suppose the appeal to be dismissed as to Hastings, Hastings can issue his execution for the amount awarded to him and the $1767. Opposing counsel will agree to this. And this shows that the libellants are joint libellants to enforce the execution of 'a decree' in their favor; and <i>not joint and several</i> libellants for the sums claimed. Indeed, having filed their libel in the form in which they have consented to do, they could not be heard to say that they were joint and several libellants for a part of their claim and joint libellants only for another part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In so far as the appellant is concerned, it is a matter of indifference how the whole amount claimed is distributed. That is a matter to be settled between the material-men (the appellees) themselves. At present, in the libel in Louisiana, the decree on which alone it is that there is an appeal, they claim jointly. And, so claiming, it is unimportant that the claims of particular claimants are less than $2000, the claim of all exceeding that sum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice CLIFFORD delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Separate libels were filed by the appellees, in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Alabama, against the steamboat Rio Grande, to enforce the payment of certain claims made by those parties against the steamboat for materials furnished for repairs and for necessary supplies, which it is alleged constituted a maritime lien upon the steamboat. Process was issued and served and the parties appeared and were heard, and the decree states that the court ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the claims contained in the libels in this cause do not constitute such a maritime lien as to give the court jurisdiction, and the court entered a decree that the libel in each case be dismissed with costs. Immediate application was made to the court by the claimants for an order that the possession of the steamboat should be delivered to them by the marshal, and the record shows that on the twelfth of May, 1868, the motion was granted. Notice of appeal was immediately given by the libellants, and two days after the order was passed delivering the steamboat to the trustees named in the application for the order, the appeal bonds were filed. During the pendency of the several libels in the District Court and before the final decree, to wit, on the tenth of December, 1867, the causes were consolidated by the court upon a written agreement being filed that the consolidation should not prejudice the officers of the court in respect to costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the eighth of June, 1871, the same material-men filed a libel in the District Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana, against the same steamboat, to enforce the maritime lien for the same claims, in which they alleged that during the pendency of the said admiralty proceedings in the District Court for the Southern District of Alabama, the court there ordered the marshal to deliver the possession of the same, as in the order previously described, and that the order was executed as made, notwithstanding the libellants appealed and gave appeal bonds operating as a supersedeas within the period allowed by law for perfecting such appeals. Process was issued and served and the appellants appeared as claimants and filed an answer. Testimony was taken, and the parties having been heard, the court entered a decree dismissing the libel, and the libellants appealed to the Circuit Court, where the parties were again heard, and the Circuit Court reversed the decree of the District Court and entered a decree that the libellants do have and recover from the steamboat the following sums, to wit: William Otis, $1508; Lyons &amp; Keyland, $1411.83; Joseph Hastings, $83.75; R. D. Port &amp; Co., 121.25; G. B. &amp; C. B. Gwin &amp; Co., $713.14, with eight per cent. interest on said different amounts, from the first of August, 1867, until paid, and costs of suit as therein specified. By the record it appears that the decree was entered on the first day of March, 1873, and of course five years and seven months' interest must be added to each of the several sums awarded in the decree. Whereupon the respondents appealed to this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two grounds for dismissing the appeal are set forth in the motion under consideration:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1st. That the transcript does not contain a true copy of the record and of all the proceedings in the case, under the hand and seal of the Circuit Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2d. That this court has no jurisdiction in the case, as the amount in dispute is less than $2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Probably the stipulation filed in the case allowing the appellants to complete and perfect the transcript in the case may be regarded as an answer to the first ground of the motion, but if not it is quite clear that the certificate of the clerk of the court must be regarded as <i>prim a facie</i> evidence that the matter of fact alleged in the motion is not well founded. Deficiencies, if any, may be supplied by <i>certiorari</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Nor can the motion be sustained for the other reason set forth, as it is certain that the decree against the appellants here in favor of two of the respective appellees exceeds the sum of $2000. True, the sums recovered by the other three appellees respectively were not sufficient to give this court jurisdiction, but the motion is to dismiss the appeal, which must be denied, as the decree in favor of the two libellants first named in the decree is, as it respects each of those, greater than $2000, when the interest allowed by the Circuit Court to the date of the decree is included with the principal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Interest to that date being specifically allowed by the decree must be included with the principal in order to determine what 'the sum or value in dispute was' at the time the appeal was taken and allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MOTION DENIED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 12 Howard, 347.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> 6 Peters, 143.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The Patapsco, 12 Wallace, 451.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Lee <i>v.</i> Watson, 1 Wallace, 337.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> 17 Howard, 3.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The Patapsco, 12 Wallace, 451.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ", "id": 88873, "judges": "", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/88873/", "sha1": "1fa7458cde5574efbb57c859a56a3e051f325e59", "source": "R", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:01:50"}
