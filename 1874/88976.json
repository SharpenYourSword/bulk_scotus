The defence was&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1st. That the husband in his lifetime had no such seizin or estate as authorized his wife to be endowed.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2d. That the curator had reserved one-third of the proceeds of the sale of the land for the wife's use and benefit, and as her supposed dower in the money.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second defence, however, was not proved, the defendant relying chiefly on the first.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Circuit Court of Adair County adjudged that the husband had not been seized of any such estate as Mrs. Johnson could be endowed of.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this judgment Mrs. Johnson took the case to the Supreme Court of Missouri. That court was of a different view, and having delivered and filed a learned opinion, found in the record, ordered the judgment of the Adair County Court to be reversed; and that&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The said cause be remanded to the aforesaid Adair Circuit Court for <i>further proceedings to be had therein in conformity with the opinion of this court herein delivered and filed</i>.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this judgment Parcels now brought the case here, where it was elaborately argued upon the merits.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. B.

The cause was sent back, therefore, for a new trial or a new hearing. Upon such trial or hearing the inferior court can proceed to render a new judgment, not inconsistent with the opinion, and that judgment may in its turn be taken to the Supreme Court for examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the record it appears that one of the defences set up in the answer, to wit, that which was based upon the implied acceptance of one-third of the proceeds of the guardian's sale in lieu of dower in the land, was not proven. On a new trial that proof may be supplied and a judgment rendered thereon satisfactory to the now complaining party. In that manner the present supposed Federal question may be put out of the case.
