They claim that they were the importers of certain burlaps, upon which the duty chargeable by law was thirty per cent <i>ad valorem;</i> that the collector insisted the goods were 'oil-cloth foundations,' upon which the duty is forty per cent <i>ad valorem</i>, and compelled them to pay accordingly. They paid under protest, and brought this suit to recover back the alleged excess of ten per cent. Under the instructions of the court, a verdict and judgment were given in their favor. The collector thereupon sued out this writ of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case arises under the fourth section of the act of June 6, 1872 (17 Stat. 232), and turns upon the construction to be given to that section with respect to the particulars here in controversy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That section declares, that after the 1st of August, 1872, in lieu of the duties theretofore levied upon the articles mentioned in the section, there should be paid upon those articles imported from foreign countries the following duties; to wit:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'<i>On all burlaps</i> and like manufactures of flax, jute, or hemp, or of which flax, jute, or hemp shall be the component material of chief value, except such as may be suitable for bagging for cotton, thirty per centum <i>ad valorem.

It is, that the descriptive terms applied to articles of commerce shall be understood according to the acceptation given to them by commercial men in our own ports at the time of the passage of the act in which they are found. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Two Hundred Chests of Tea</i>, 9 Wheat. 230; <i>Elliot</i> v. <i>Swartout</i>, 10 Pet. 151; <i>Curtis</i> v. <i>Martin</i>, 3 How. 106.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute here in question declares that 'on <i>all</i> burlaps and like manufactures of flax, jute, or hemp, . . . except such as may be suitable for bagging for cotton, a duty of thirty per centum <i>ad valorem</i> shall be paid.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mercantile testimony in the record shows that the articles in question were 'burlaps,' that they were a 'manufacture of jute,' and that they were not suitable for bagging for cotton. The exception may, therefore, be laid out of view. The language of the statute is clear and explicit. It is, '<i>all</i> burlaps' made of jute, &amp;c. The mercantile proof brings the case exactly within this category. The fact that the burlaps were suitable, and could be and were used for oil-cloth foundations, or for any other purpose except bagging for cotton, is entirely immaterial.

It is there stated that '<i>floor-cloth canvas</i>' is used exclusively for the manufacture of <i>floor oil-cloth</i>. 'It has a harder twist, is heavier, is a more expensive article than burlaps, and is not calendered as burlaps are. . . . Foor-cloth canvas is a commercial term implying a well-known article of merchandise thus described; and a merchant, in speaking of <i>foundations for oil-cloths</i>, would be considered to refer to '<i>floor-cloth canvas</i>.'

In those cases it was obviously done to make clear and certain the meaning of the legislature, and to leave no room for doubt upon the subject. Such in this section seems to have been the purpose of Congress. The phrase <i>oil-cloth foundations</i> would not necessarily import the article known in commerce as <i>floor-cloth canvas;</i> nor would the phrase <i>floor-cloth canvas</i> necessarily import an article to be used for '<i>oil-cloth foundations</i>.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering the juxtaposition and connection in which the two phrases are found, and letting in upon them the light of the mercantile evidence, the inference is clear that Congress used them, and intended that they should be understood, as convertible terms.
