JUSTICE MILLER delivered the opinion of the court. The defendant, the Commercial Bank of Alabama, was a banking corporation organized under the laws of that State, and had become insolvent. The appellant, a citizen of the State of South Carolina, brought a suit in the District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, at that time exercising circuit-court powers, to wind up the bank under the provisions of the twenty-first section of its charter. Plaintiff alleged and proved that he was the owner or about $3,000 of the notes of the bank, on which he had demanded payment, and been refused. The bank admitted its insolvency; and a receiver was appointed by consent to wind up its affairs, and publication made for all creditors to come in and prove their claims. The receiver made his report, which was referred to a master, who also reported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These reports, and several supplemental reports, were all confirmed without exceptions, and a final order of distribution made among those who had proved their claims, allowing first the costs of the proceeding, including attorney's fees and other costs of suit.

They are mainly addressed to the discretion of the court, coming as they do after a final decree on the merits. If appellant desired to place the case in a position where this court could review the action of the court on that class of questions, he should have filed his bill of review and made the proper issues, and supported it by depositions.
