He commenced this suit 'in behalf of himself and all other parties in like condition who will concur and unite and contribute to the expenses,' to obtain a decree in his own favor against the bank for the amount of his debt; an account by the assignee; the conversion of the assigned property into money under the authority and direction of the court, and the distribution of the proceeds among the creditors according to the assignment. In the progress of the cause a decree was rendered against the bank and in favor of Terry for $23,297. Afterwards decrees were entered requiring all persons interested in the distribution of the assets to make themselves parties, and referring the cause to a master to take testimony and report the amounts due to the several claimants, the nature of their respective claims, and the order in which they were entitled to payment out of the fund in court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The master reported, allowing claims amounting in the aggregate to about $425,000, all of which were entitled to participate <i>pro rata</i> in the distribution.

Terry presented an account for $25, on which he claimed priority of payment; but, upon its disallowance, Hatch became entitled to no more than his share upon a <i>pro rata</i> distribution of that amount to all the creditors. So, too, Hatch, upon the allowance of his claim, became entitled under the decree to a dividend of about $6,000; but, if it had been disallowed, Terry would have received only his share of the amount of the dividend upon a like <i>pro rata</i> distribution. If Terry succeeds in this appeal, he can only recover from Hatch what would have been distributed to him in the court below, if his exceptions had been there sustained. The aggregate of the claims allowed, deducting that of Hatch, is about $350,000; and of this amount Terry has but $23,297. Upon a distribution of the amount decreed to Hatch among the other creditors, the dividend would be less than two per cent upon the amount of the several claims, or but little more than $500 to Terry.
