Art. 545, Code 1870; art. 546 of former Code. This, by the operation of sect. 914 of the Revised Statutes (which is a reproduction of sect. 6 of 'An Act to further the administration of justice,' passed June 1, 1872, 17 Stat. 197), is now by law a rule of practice for the courts of the United States within that State; and it seems, that, as early as 1828, the District Court of the United States in Louisiana had adopted it as a rule of that court. Such being the case, this court held, in <i>Life and Fire Insurance Company of New York</i> v. <i>Wilson's Heirs</i>, 8 Pet. 303, decided in 1834, that 'the judgment, without the signature of the judge, cannot be enforced. It is not a final judgment on which a writ of error may issue for its reversal. Without the action of the judge, the plaintiffs can take no step. . . . They can neither issue execution on the judgment, nor reverse the proceedings by writ of error.' This is in accordance with the settled practice in Louisiana, and is decisive of this case. <i>Stark</i> v. <i>Burke</i>, 9 La. Ann. 345; <i>Sprigg</i> v. <i>Wells</i>, 5 Mart. N. S. 105; <i>Ex parte Nicholass</i>, 4 Rob. 53; <i>Mech. &amp; Tr. Bank N. O.</i> v. <i>Walter</i>, 7 id. 451; <i>Succession of Arbridge</i>, 1 La. Ann. 207; <i>McWillie</i> v. <i>Perkins</i>, 20 id. 169. As only final judgments can be re-examined here upon writs of error, the judgment to be 'rendered,' which the statute refers to, must be the final judgment. That judgment is not rendered in Louisiana until it is signed by the judge. In other States, the rule in this respect may be different; and in <i>Silsby</i> v. <i>Foote</i>, 20 How. 295, we said, 'The time to be taken as when the judgment or decree may be said to be rendered or passed may admit of some latitude, and may depend somewhat upon the usage and practice of the particular court.' But this being a judgment in Louisiana, and not having been signed until after May 1, was not rendered, according to the practice in that State, before that date; and consequently the writ must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "", "html_with_citations": "<p class=\"case_cite\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></span></p>\n    <p class=\"case_cite\">23 L.Ed. 892</p>\n    <p class=\"parties\">YZNAGA DEL VALLE<br>v.<br>HARRISON ET AL.</p>\n    <p class=\"date\">October Term, 1876</p>\n    <div class=\"prelims\">\n      <p class=\"indent\">MOTION to dismiss a writ of error to the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Edward Janin</i> for the defendants in error, in support of the motion.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Thomas J.
