Garnishee summons with interrogatories attached were thereupon issued. The companies answered, denying their indebtedness; but the court, on the 4th of December, 1873, having, upon consideration of said answers and the argument of counsel thereon, found that the sum of $7,500 would be due from the garnishees to the defendant on the first day of January then next ensuing, passed the following order:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'It is, therefore, now by the court here considered, ordered, and adjudged that said garnishees, the Pacific Railroad and the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company aforesaid, as garnishees herein, pay into this court, to the clerk thereof, on the first day of January next, so much of said sum of $7,500 as it will require to pay and discharge the judgment heretofore, and on the thirtieth day of November, A.D. 1872, rendered herein in favor of said plaintiff against said defendant, that is, the sum of $6,385, with interest thereon at the rate of seven per cent per annum from the said thirtieth day of November, A.D. 1872, and the costs by said plaintiff in this action expended, and that execution issue therefor if they neglect to make such payment on that first day of January, A.D. 1873; and that on scuh payment being made herein to said clerk by said garnishees, or either of them, the said garnishees are to both stand and be discharged herefrom without costs against them or either of them; but if they fail to make such payment on said first day of January next, then such execution is to be issued and enforced against said garnishees and their and each of their property, as their costs.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this order and judgment said garnishees excepted, and sued out this writ of error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Argued by <i>Mr. C.
