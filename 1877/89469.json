The defendant below thereupon offered to show that it had been regularly listed and entered for taxation, and sold in 1864 for the non-payment of taxes assessed against it; and that he was in possession, claiming under a deed from the authorities of the District pursuant to such sale. The court excluded the evidence.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, and a judgment was rendered thereon.
