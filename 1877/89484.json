True, the plaintiff in an action then pending in that court against Elisha T. Loring, the petitioner, after a jury had been empanelled and the testimony on his part concluded, elected to become nonsuit, and that a judgment to that effect was entered. On the 17th October, 1876, at a subsequent term of the court, after notice to the attorney of Loring, True moved to set aside this judgment and restore the cause to the docket for trial. This motion was granted Oct. 31, and, later in the term, Loring appeared by his co nsel, and moved to vacate the order then made. This last motion was refused, Jan. 15, 1877, and, Jan. 29, this petition was filed by Loring for a writ of <i>mandamus</i> to the judges of the Circuit Court, requiring them 'to vacate the order setting aside said nonsuit.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Alfred Russell</i> for the petitioner.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No opposing counsel.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR.

This cannot be done. We may require the Circuit Court to decide in a proper case if it refuses to act, but cannot control its decision. Here the court has acted, and given its decision upon a motion made. We are asked now to require it to reverse that decision. For that, resort must be had to a writ of error after a final judgment has been rendered.
