See sects. 133, 137.</p>\n<p>By the statute of 1866 the duty becomes a lien on the succession \"from the time when such tax shall become due and payable.\" 14 Stat. p. 140. By the same statute an assessment is to be made within thirty days from the time the party becomes entitled to the possession of the estate. Id. 140, 141.</p>\n<p>It is manifest that the right does not accrue until the duty can be demanded, that is, when it is made payable; in other words, at the end of thirty days after becoming entitled to possession.</p>\n<p>The provision of a subsequent section (sect. 144) in relation to estates in expectancy, that is, where the estate of the successor is not a vested one, is upon the same theory. In that case the commissioner of internal revenue is authorized to commute the duty presumptively payable for a sum certain to be presently paid, ascertaining the present value of such presumptive duty upon principles laid down. It is not certainly known in either class of cases who will be the party liable to pay the duty, upon what value it shall be paid, nor what will be its rate, until the arrival of the time of enjoyment.</p>\n<p>In the case we are considering, the successor did not become entitled to the possession or enjoyment of the estate until the death of the widow, which occurred on the seventeenth day of June, 1872. The duty imposed extended only to successions accruing prior to Aug. 1, 1870. The saving clause, therefore, does not reach the case.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*593</span> May v.
