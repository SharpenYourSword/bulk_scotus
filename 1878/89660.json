On the 12th of April, 1869, the claimant was appointed and commissioned an assistant-surgeon in the navy of the United States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. On the 24th of February, 1874, after examination, he was found qualified for promotion to the grade of surgeon. He was, on the following day, notified by the Secretary of the Navy that the report of the board of examiners, before whom he had appeared for examination, was approved by the department, and that from that date he would be regarded as a passed assistant-surgeon; and from that date up to the date of the institution of this suit, May 3, 1876, he received pay as passed assistant-surgeon in the first five years after appointment as such.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. From the 12th of April, 1874, till May 3, 1876, the claimant's service was as follows: On shore-duty, four hundred and thirty-eight days, for which he was paid at the rate of $1,800 per annum; on leave or waiting orders, three hundred and twenty-three days, for which he was paid at the rate of $1,500 per a num.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the foregoing facts the court, being equally divided in opinion, held <i>pro forma</i>, for the purposes of an appeal, that the claimant was entitled to the rate of pay established by law for a passed assistant-surgeon, after five years from the date of appointment; that is to say, when on shore-duty, at the rate of $2,000 per annum, and when on leave or waiting orders, at the rate of $1,700 per annum; and that the claimant was therefore entitled to receive, for the seven hundred and sixty-one days specified, the additional sum of $409.5, for which judgment was entered.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States appealed.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Assistant Attorney-General Smith</i> for the United States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. John B.
