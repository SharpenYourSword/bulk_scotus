On all manufactures of silk, or of which silk is the component material of chief value, not otherwise provided for, fifty per cent <i>ad valorem</i>.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The collector pleaded that the moneys sued for were a part of the lawful duty of sixty per cent <i>ad valorem</i> for 'silk veils' imported by the plaintiffs. They replied, that the veils were not 'silk veils,' but a manufacture of silk, and were 'crape veils;' that at the time of the passage of the act of June 30, 1864, they were commercially known among importers and dealers, and were bought and sold, as 'crape veils,' and never otherwise, and were liable to a duty of fifty per cent <i>ad valorem</i> as a manufacture of silk. The defendant demurred to the replication. The demurrer was overruled, and judgment rendered for the plaintiffs. The defendant sued out this writ of error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Assistant-Attorney-General Smith</i> for the plaintiff in error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Edward Hartley, contra</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. JUSTICE HUNT delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was undisputed upon the pleadings that the veils in question were commercially known among importers and dealers, and were bought and sold, as 'crape veils,' and never otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of law thus presented is, whether veils, which are not commonly called 'silk veils,' but are veils manufactured of silk, and are known commercially as 'crape veils,' and not otherwise, are liable to a duty of sixty per cent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument of the government is, that the statute in question is a comprehensive one, intended to include all articles made of silk, or of which silk is the component material of chief value, specifically enumerating in its first branch a variety of subjects on which should be imposed a duty of sixty per cent, and further providing, that on all manufactures from that material not otherwise provided for a duty of fifty per cent should be levied and collected. Silk veils, it is said, are specifically enumerated as being liable to a duty of sixty per cent, and the articles in question being veils of which the material is silk, are within the enumerating clause of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this were all, the argument would be a strong one. But the fact that the veils in question are universally known and recognized among merchants and importers as crape veils, and not otherwise, and are never called or known as silk veils, is to be taken into the account. Although crape is shown to be a material of silk, to which a certain resinous substance has been applied, neither the merchant nor the ordinary buyer understands them to be identical. Neither the merchant who should order a case of crapes and receive one of silk goods, or who should order silk and receive crape, nor the individual purchaser who should order a dress of silk and receive one of crape, or should order crape for mourning and receive silk, would deem that the order had been properly filed. The general understanding concurs in this respect with that of the trader and importer, and must determine the construction to be given to the language of the statute. Especially should this view prevail as to laws made for the government of the importer. His business is regulated by them; and it is but reasonable that, like the language of marine policies and the terms of the law-merchant, supposed to be especially applicable to this class, these laws should be construed as universally understood by the importer and trader. Obsolete words, or those whose meaning is differently understood by the writer and the reader, produce disorder and confusion. Importations from foreign countries are necessarily made with reference to the duties to be paid upon their entry into the ports of this country. If these are not reasonably uniform, and cannot be ascertained, the transaction of business will be impossible. No man can determine whether his venture will enrich him, or make him a bankrupt. In <i>Lattimer</i> v. <i>Smythe</i>, it is said, 'Where general terms are used, the terms are to be taken in their ordinary and comprehensive meaning, unless it is shown that they have, in their commercial use, acquired a special and restricted meaning.' 17 Int.
