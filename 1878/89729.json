Reynes, on behalf of the New Orleans National Banking Association, applied to the National Park Bank of New York for a loan of $150,000, upon the notes of the former, to be secured by a pledge of collaterals. On the 11th of June, the president of the Park Bank, at New York, addressed a letter to Charles Cavaroc, president of the New Orleans National Banking Association, in which he says: 'Mr. E. H. Reynes has made an application for a loan to the New Orleans National Banking Association, to be secured by the bills receivable of the bank. We will loan you $75,000, payable Oct. 10, and $75,000, payable Oct. 20, next. As collateral to these notes, select $170,000 of your bills receivable of best known names; retain them as deposited by us, sending us a schedule and receipt for them,&#8212;as held in trust for us and subject to our order.' On the 11th of June, Cavaroc, as president of the New Orleans Bank, sent to the Park Bank, in a letter, two notes of the former for $75,000, each payable as agreed, and a list of notes and bills receivable, amounting to about $170,000, with a receipt appended thereto, as follows:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'NEW ORLEANS, June 11, 1873.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Received, in trust, for account of the National Park Bank of New York, from the New Orleans National Banking Association, $170,084.42, of bills receivable described in annexed statement; said bills receivable being given by the New Orleans National Banking Association, as collateral security of their notes, due respectively on the 10th and 20th of October next, 1873, each for the sum of $75,000, payable to the order of the National Park Bank of New York.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

As fast as the bills receivable will mature and be paid, I beg the privilege of substituting new collaterals, of which due notice will be given you.' The Park Bank, in a letter of June 17, assented to this request, as follows: 'You can make the change of collaterals you mention, advising us of the same, and that you hold the new paper the same as the old; viz., in trust.'
