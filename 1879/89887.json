The pensions to soldiers, their widows and orphans, is not pay, and the provisions for paying them are not under that act. Arrearages of pay were not collected under any pension law, or through the pension office. What is meant by bounty here is said in the briefs to be also passed upon and paid in another bureau. The indictment is perhaps on this point a little obscure. In the sixth count the defendant is charged as guilty of withholding <i>arrearages</i> of <i>pay and bounty</i>, and in the tenth with withholding pay and bounty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the act in which this offence is described makes no provision for pay or for bounty, and the fees regulated and the acts forbidden are those done in regard <i>to that act</i>, it seems a reasonable construction of the penal part of the statute that withholding <i>pay</i> and <i>bounty</i>, which are not mentioned there, are not intended to be punished by the act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not in reference to pay that Congress was legislating.

The offence described is 'withholding from a pensioner or other claimant the whole or any part of the claim allowed and due said pensioner or claimant,' and it is but a just limitation of the word 'claimant' that he should be a claimant under that act, a claimant before the pension bureau. This part of the section is to be taken in connection with the taking of illegal fees, which manifestly refers to cases before the pension office, and which are described and punished in the same sentence and by the same penalty. The word 'bounty' is not used in this sentence, nor the word 'pay,' but the argument is that the word 'claim' includes them.

The law then in existence did not make the act charged a crime. It is argued by counsel that withholding the money due is a continuous offence, and if the same money was withheld after the act of 1873 did make such withholding punishable, the indictment is good under that act. But without deciding here how far the withholding the money under a law which made that an offence when the wrongful withholding began, can be held to be a continuous offence, we are of opinion that it would be a forced construction of the act to hold that it was intended to apply to a case where the money had already been withheld five years when the statute was passed. The party might very well be criminally wrong in failing to pay when he received it; but Congress could hardly be supposed to intend to punish as a crime his failure to pay afterwards what was in law but a debt created five years before.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This answers the fifth question, namely, 'Can the defendant be punished under sect. 31 of the act of March 3, 1873?'
