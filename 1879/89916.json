N. Parker,' and a canal-boat loaded with coal, whereof he was master, having on board his wife and children, and which with other boats was in tow of the steam-tug 'U. S. Grant.' The Eastern Transportation Line owning one tug, and J. J. Austin the other, were the defendants. Cooper, in the court below, had a judgment against them. The Eastern Transportation Line alone appealed to the general term. The judgment was affirmed there, and subsequently on appeal by the Court of Appeals. This writ of error was then sued out.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the errors assigned is that the court charged the jury that 'there is no law requiring that a canal-boat which is not used for the purpose of transporting passengers should be provided with life-preservers or life-boats, or any paraphernalia of that kind.' The other errors are grounded upon exceptions to the charge, which relate to questions not arising under any act of Congress.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant in error moved to dismiss the writ for want of jurisdiction, and united therewith, under the amended sixth rule, a motion to affirm the judgment below.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. William Stanley</i> in support of the motion.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. R.

A canal-boat laden with coal for transportation, having on board the wife and children of the captain, is not 'a barge carrying passengers,' within the meaning of sect. 4492, Rev. Stat., which requires such a barge, while in tow of a steamer, to be provided with 'fire-buckets, axes, life-preservers, and yawls.'
