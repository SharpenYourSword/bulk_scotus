The defendants answered; and the cause coming on to be heard upon the pleadings and proofs, a final decree was rendered at the special term, which was affirmed at the general term of that court.

Here, although an appeal bond was approved by the Chief Justice of the court and filed with the clerk during the term, it does not appear to have been done while the court was actually in session. So far as the record shows, it was the act of the Chief Justice alone out of court.
