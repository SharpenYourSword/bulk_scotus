Pence lived in California, and was engaged in mining operations. On the 10th of December, 1874, Langdon, by a letter of that date, advised Pence that he had seen Watson, and inquired about their mining interests. He concluded by saying: 'If any thing can be done that will be satisfactory to all parties, let me know.' Pence replied by letter of the 17th of that month. Speaking of the mine in which he and Watson were concerned, he said, amongst other things: 'There is an eighth, that is, 7,500 shares, that can be bought if taken at once, at the same I paid and the same Watson paid, after looking and prospecting for five weeks.' 'The price is . . . $8,368.75, gold.' . . . 'Should you conclude to buy, you must telegraph me here on receipt of this letter. You can pay,' &amp;c. 'This will put you on the ground-floor with us, or better than I am, as I have spent about $600 to find this mine, prospect it, and have title looked up, &amp;c. Our title is O. K.' Langdon bought and paid the price demanded. On the 28th of January, 1875, Pence addressed Langdon another letter from San Francisco, in which he said: 'There have been not less than 1/2 doz. after the 7,500 <i>shares of stock I sold you</i>, and all were astonished to find themselves too late; and still more astonished when I told them there was no more to be had at present, as we have the controlling interest, and propose to run the mine as we think best.' . . . 'The stock I have deposited in the Nat. Gold Bank and Trust Co. of this city.' . . . 'I would like to have you come out after the roads get good and weather pleasant in the spring.' This letter enclosed a bill commencing 'Hon. R. B. Langdon, Mina., to J. W. Pence, dr.' The stock was charged and the amount paid was credited. No person other than Pence was named as the seller. Linton and Shepherd were interested with Langdon in the purchase. On the 20th of June, 1875, all of them visited the mine with Pence. They claimed then to have learned for the first time that Pence had sold them his own stock, and to have learned also that the stock was worth much less than they had paid for it. They arrived on Saturday, and on the next day notified Pence that they rescinded the contract, and required what they had paid to be refunded. Shepherd and Linton transferred their interest to Langdon, and he thereupon brought this suit. The code of Minnesota authorized it to be in his name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the trial in the court below six exceptions were taken by Pence.

No harm was, therefore, done by the omission of the court; and if it were erroneous, the error is one of which Pence certainly has no right to complain. With respect to the duty of the court as to construing the letters, see <i>Etting</i> v. <i>The Bank of the United States</i>, 11 Wheat. 59; <i>Barreda</i> v. <i>Silsbee</i>, 21 How. 146.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'2.
