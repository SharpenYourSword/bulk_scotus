United States, 10 How. 109.</p>\n<p>Treasury settlements of the kind are only prima facie evidence of the correctness of the balance certified; but it is as competent for the accounting officers to correct mistakes and to restate the balance as it is for a judge to change his decree during the term in which it was entered. United States v. Eckford, 1 id. 250. Errors of computation against the United States are no more vested rights in favor of sureties than in favor of the principal. All such mistakes in cases like the present may be corrected by a restatement of the account.</p>\n<p>Sufficient appears to show that the principal defendant was appointed collector March 28, 1865, in the recess of the Senate, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> to hold until the expiration of the then next session of Congress, and no longer. On the 25th of July following he was appointed to the same office by the President and was confirmed by the Senate. Due notice of his appointment was given, and he was furnished with a blank form of bond, which, on Nov. 2, 1866, he executed with sureties; but the bond being several and not joint and several, as it should be, he was officially requested to execute a new bond correcting that error. In pursuance of that request, on the 12th of January of the next year he executed the bond described in the complaint, and from the date of the first bond to the date of the second his accounts were settled by the treasury officers under the first bond. When the second bond was offered in evidence, the defendant objected to its admissibility; but the court overruled the objection, and instructed the jury that it was not extorted, which instruction constitutes the fourth exception.</p>\n<p>Evidence to support the charge of duress is entirely wanting. Instead of that, the defendant testified that he did not remember that he made any objection to executing the bond, and supposed that he did it because the commissioner had given such directions.</p>\n<p>Exception was also taken to the instruction of the court that the direction of the commissioner to execute a new bond must be considered as the direction of the secretary, which is so obviously correct as to require no argument in its support, as it is matter of common knowledge that the commissioner is a subordinate officer of the Treasury Department. Dugan v. United States, 3 Wheat. 172; United States v. Kirkpatrick, 9 id. 720; Hamilton v. Dillon, 21 Wall. 73.</p>\n<p>Suffice it to say that in view of these suggestions it is clear that there is no error in the record.</p>\n<p>Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</div>", "id": 90005, "judges": "Clifford", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/90005/", "sha1": "9d480f65f8c83bea46c9c6547784ef62f3770d4b", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:02:22"}
