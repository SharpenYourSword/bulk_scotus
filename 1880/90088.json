The following is a copy of one of their protests, the others being substantially like it:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'SIR,&#8212;We do hereby protest against the payment of fifteen per cent charged on sixteen hundred and fifty (1650) boxes tin plates of the dutiable value of $14,422, gold, contained in our entry made on the twenty-third day of September, 1874, per S. S. 'Algeria,' from Liverpool, England, in cases marked P. D. &amp; Co., and various other marks, claiming that under existing laws said goods are only liable to a duty of ninety per cent of fifteen per cent or thirteen and one-half per cent, because title 33, sect. 2503, of the codification of the revenue laws provides certain rates of duty on articles which are mentioned in Schedule E of sect. 2504, with the provisions that all articles mentioned in 2503 shall have the benefit of ten per cent reduction&#8212;one of the provisions&#8212;on all metals not herein otherwise provided for, and on all manufactures of, &amp;c., &amp;c., includes tin plate, and pay the amount exacted in order to get possession of the goods, and look to you for refund of the same.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary of the Treasury having, on appeal, affirmed the decision of the collector, the firm brought this suit to recover the difference between the amount paid and ninety per cent thereof.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was a judgment for the plaintiffs.

Looking, then, to this case, we find that Congress has declared the law to be that only ninety per cent of the rates of duty imposed by the schedules in sect. 2504 shall be collected on all metals not otherwise provided for in sect. 2503, and on all manufactures of metals of which either of them is the component part of chief value, and on iron and all manufactures of iron of which that metal shall be a component part of chief value. In this there seems no ambiguity, and if 'tin plates' and 'terne tin' are metal or manufactures of metal, or if they can be classed as iron or manufactures of iron in which iron is the component part of chief value, there cannot be a doubt that they come within the ninety per cent clause. They are classified in the schedules as metals. All the elements of which they are composed are metals. Their manufacture consists in the combination of the several component parts. The tin is still tin, and the iron still iron. There has been no substantial chemical change. All their metallic qualities still remain. They are what they purport to be, manufactures of iron, tin, and sometimes lead, and the result is a new article of commerce, of which metals, as metals, form the component parts. Although they have, when combined, a particular name, it is a name applicable to the element in the combination, whose use it was intended in this way to secure. Percussion-caps, watches and jewelry, and other articles of ornament, made of metal, must have been considered as manufactures of metal, or it would not have been necessary to except them by name from the operation of the reduction clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without pursuing the subject further, it is sufficient to say that we are clearly of the opinion that the articles in question were dutiable only at ninety per cent of the rate of fifteen per cent <i>ad valorem</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An objection is made to the sufficiency of the protest. The claim is that it was not so distinct and specific as to apprise the collector of the nature of the objection made to the duty imposed. 'Technical precision,' says Mr. Justice Clifford, for the court, in <i>Davies</i> v. <i>Arthur</i> (96 U. S. 148, 151), 'is not required; but the objection must be so distinct and specific, as, when fairly construed, to show that the objection taken at the trial was at the time in the mind of the importer, and that it was sufficient to notify the collector of its true nature and character, to the end that he might ascertain the precise facts, and have an opportunity to correct the mistake and cure the defect, if it was one that could be obviated.' We have had no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that the protest in this case fully meets the requirements of this rule.
