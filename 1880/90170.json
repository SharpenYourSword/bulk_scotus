There is no such admission here by the counsel of the United States.</p>\n<p>We cannot look beyond the record, and that is silent upon the subject.</p>\n<p>It is said, further, that the transcript shows the deduction from a charge for stamps of $1,100, not here in controversy. It would be a long stride in dialectics, and one we are not prepared to take, from this fact to the inference, that the purchaser also furnished the die when the stamps in question were bought. The conclusion claimed from such premises would be a palpable non sequitur.</p>\n<p>It is rather to be inferred that the allowance was made in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*601</span> one case because the die was furnished, and refused in the other because it was not.</p>\n<p>Error must be affirmatively shown. It is not to be presumed.</p>\n<p>Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</div>", "id": 90170, "judges": "Swayne", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/90170/", "sha1": "11c467296dcfdfc52f6b37762dfb510887d93730", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:02:26"}
