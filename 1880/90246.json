Upton, assignee in bankruptcy of the Great Western Insurance Company of Chicago, Ill., to recover from Theodore Hawley the unpaid instalments alleged to be due on his contract to subscribe to the capital stock of that company.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court, the case having been submitted to it upon the pleadings and proofs without the intervention of a jury, found the following facts:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The plaintiff is assignee in bankruptcy, as alleged in the petition.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'On the second day of January, 1871, Rossitur, agent of the Great Western Insurance Company, requested the defendant to take stock in said company.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The defendant, on certain representations by Rossitur, signed the following paper or bond:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"No.$03R] THE GREAT WESTERN INSURANCE COMPANY.

All that need be done, so far as creditors are concerned, is that the subscriber shall have bound himself to become a contributor to the fund which the capital stock of the corporation represents.

The only question we have to consider is whether, from the facts found, it appears that Hawley, the plaintiff in error, had become an accepted subscriber to the stock of the company before the bankruptcy. There can be no doubt that he was approached by an agent of the company with a view of securing him as a subscriber. It is equally true that after the representations made to him he was willing to become a stockholder. The result was that he executed the paper set out in the findings, by which he acknowledged the receipt from the company of ten shares of its stock, and agreed within the time named to pay to the company $200, or twenty per cent of its par value. As the company could not sell its stock at less than par, what was done amounted in law to a subscription for the stock, and nothing else. It is true the stock he took purported to be non-assessable; but that in law could only mean that no assessment would be made beyond the percentage he had specially bound himself to pay, unless the legal liabilities of the company required it. <i>Upton, Assignee</i>, v. <i>Tribilcock, supra</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The paper he signed was delivered to the company by the agent who got it.

It matters not that he had no knowledge of such a publication. His receipt for the stock was an acknowledgment, so far as he was concerned, that he had become a stockholder, and, after an acceptance by the company, his liability was fixed whether any publication was made or not. The publication is only important as a means of showing that his subscription made to an agent had been accepted and ratified by the company. The entries on the books had the same effect. The publication only made it more notorious.

It may be conceded that if a suit had been brought by the company on the express promise to pay the twenty per cent, there could have been no recovery without a tender of the certificate; but that is not this case. Here the creditors of the bankrupt company are proceeding against Hawley as a stockholder, to compel him to contribute to the found which the law had provided for their security, what he by his subscription agreed he would pay. The suit is not brought on his special agreement to pay the twenty per cent, but on his general liability as a subscriber to pay for his stock whenever it was wanted to meet the liabilities of the company.
