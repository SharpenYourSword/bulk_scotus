It suspended payment June 9, 1877. Shortly thereafter Johnston was, by the Comptroller of the Currency, appointed suc  receiver. He then took possession of its assets, and disposed of them in the settlement of its liabilities. The bill avers that while in his hands the assets were subject to taxation under the laws of that State for the support of the State government, the government of the city, and the public schools, in like manner and to the same extent and effect as all other taxable personal property in the city during the same period; that the assessment of taxes for the years 1877 and 1878 was duly made; that the fund in his hands in sufficient to pay them; and that the shares of the bank since his appointment have been absolutely worthless. It prays for an order upon him to pay the taxes out of that fund, and for general relief.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court sustained a demurrer to the bill, and Rosenblatt appealed.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Leverett Bell</i> for the appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. J.

Such property and assets, in legal contemplation, still belong to the bank, though in the hands of a receiver, to be administered under the law. The bank did not cease to exist on the appointment of the receiver. Its corporate capacity continues until its affairs are finally wound up and its assets distributed. <i>Bank of Bethel</i> v. <i>Pahquioque Bank</i>, 14 Wall. 383; <i>Kennedy</i> v. <i>Gibson</i>, 8 id. 498; <i>Bank</i> v. <i>Kennedy</i>, 17 id. 19.
