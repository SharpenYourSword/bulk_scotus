The declaration alleges that a policy of insurance was issued by the Republican Life Insurance Company of Chicago on the life of his intestate, who died while the policy was in full force and effect; that proof of death and the d justment of the loss were duly made, but that the company failed to pay any part of the sum due by the terms of the contract.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The declaration also avers that Gray, the defendant, was a stockholder of the company to the amount of $10,000, of which he had actually paid in only $2,000; and that under the sixth section of the charter, which is set out in the opinion of this court, he is, to the amount of his unpaid stock, liable to the plaintiff.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court sustained a demurred to the declaration, and Blair sued out this writ.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. E.
