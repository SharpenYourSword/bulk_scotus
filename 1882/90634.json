Douglass against the County of Ralls, to recover the amount due upon certain interest coupons detached from bonds issued by the defendant in payment of its subscription to the capital stock of the St. Louis and Keokuk Railroad Company, which was incorporated by an act of the General Assembly of Missouri approved Feb. 16, 1857.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The section of the act under which the county claimed the right to subscribe is set forth in the opinion of this court in the following case, p. 733.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bonds are sealed with the seal of the county court, tested by the clerk, and countersigned by the agent of the county. Those bearing date Feb. 10, 1870, recite that they are issued under the authority of said act, and in pursuance of an order of the county court of Feb. 8, 1870, to subscribe $200,000 to the capital stock of that company. Those bearing date June 13, 1871, differ in their recitals from the others, in stating that they are issued in pursuance of that order and of an order amendatory thereof dated June 13, 1871.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A demurrer was sustained to several of the defences set up in the answer. Upon the issues of fact the jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff, and, judgment having been rendered thereon, the county brought this writ of error.

In <i>State</i> v. <i>Douglass</i> (50 Mo. 593, 596), the Supreme Court of that State said: 'Without this rule the business of a community could not be transacted. The public are necessarily compelled to do business with an officer who is exercising the duties and privileges of an office under color of right, strangers should be void would stranges should be void would be productive of irreparable mischief. It would cause a suspension of business till every officer's right <i>de jure</i> was established.' To the same effect is <i>Harbaugh</i> v. <i>Winsor</i>, 38 id. 327. This is conclusive. The question here is not whether Dimmick was <i>de jure</i> probate judge of Ralls County, but whether he was acting under color of right as a justice and president of the county court.

Railroad Co.</i> v. <i>Alderman</i>, 47 id. 349; <i>State</i> v. <i>County Court of Sullivan County</i>, 51 id. 522, dicided in 1873, in which it was said, 'it has always been held that the provision of the Constitution, art. 11, sect. 14, was a limitation upon the future power of the legislature, and was not intended to retroact so as to have any controlling application to laws in existence when the Constitution was adopted;' <i>State</i> v. <i>Greene County</i>, 54 id. 540; <i>County of Callaway</i> v. <i>Foster</i>, 93 U.

When all these cases were decided the act of March 23, 1861, was in force, which provided that it should not be lawful for counties to subscribe to the stock of railroad companies until an election had been held under the provisions of that act, yet it seems never to have been specially referred to, either by counsel or the court, except once in <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Clarke County</i> (54 Mo. 58, 70), when Napton, J., said: 'So that the provisions of the revised code of 1855, and the amendatory acts of 1860 and 1861, and the constitutional prohibition, and the legislative adoption of that prohibition immediately after its passage, have been held by repeated adjudications, and without any conflicting opinions of the court, or any individual judge thereof, so far as their reports show, not to effect the repeal of the privileges contained in special charters.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such being the condition of the law on this subject down to April, 1878, we do not feel inclined to reconsider our former rulings, and follow the later decisions of the Supreme Court of the State in <i>State</i> v. <i>Garroute</i> (67 Mo. 445) and <i>State</i> v. <i>Dallas</i> <i>County</i> (72 id. 329), where this whole line of cases was substantially overruled.

It is, indeed, said in a proviso that the intention was only to exempt State, county, town, or municipal corporations from taxation while in the exercise of the functions strictly belonging to them in their ordinary governmental and municipal capacity; but that does not, as we think, affect this case.

State v. Macon County Court, 41 Mo. 453; Kansas City, &amp;c. Railroad Co. v. Alderman, 47 id. 349; State v. County Court of Sullivan County, 51 id. 522, decided in 1873, in which it was said, \"it has always been held that the provision of the Constitution, art. 11, sect. 14, was a limitation upon the future power of the legislature, and was not intended to retroact so as to have any controlling application to laws in existence when the Constitution was adopted;\" State v. Greene County, 54 id. 540; County of Callaway v. Foster, 93 U.S. 567; County of Scotland v. Thomas, 94 id. 682; County of Henry v. Nicolay, 95 id. 619; County of Cass v. Gillett, 100 id. 585. When all these cases were decided the act of March 23, 1861, was in force, which provided that it should not be lawful for counties to subscribe to the stock of railroad companies until an election had been held under the provisions of that act, yet it seems never to have been specially referred to, either by counsel or the court, except once in Smith v. Clarke County (54 Mo. 58, 70), when Napton, J., said: \"So that the provisions of the revised code of 1855, and the amendatory acts of 1860 and 1861, and the constitutional prohibition, and the legislative adoption of that prohibition immediately after its passage, have been held by repeated adjudications, and without any conflicting opinions of the court, or any individual judge thereof, so far as their reports show, not to effect the repeal of the privileges contained in special charters.\"</p>\n<p>Such being the condition of the law on this subject down to April, 1878, we do not feel inclined to reconsider our former rulings, and follow the later decisions of the Supreme Court of the State in State v. Garroute (67 Mo. 445) and State v. Dallas County (72 id. 329), where this whole line of cases was substantially overruled. The bonds involved in this suit were all in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*732</span> the hands of innocent holders when the law of the State was so materially altered by its courts. In our opinion, the rights of the parties to this suit are to be determined by the \"law as it was judicially construed to be when the bonds in question were put on the market as commercial paper.\" Douglass v. Pike County, 101 U.S. 687.</p>\n<p>4. As to the stamps.</p>\n<p>The act of July 13, 1866, c. 184 (14 Stat. 141), amending sect. 154 of June 30, 1864, c. 173 (13 id. 293), provided that all official instruments, documents, and papers issued by the officers of the United States government, or by the officers of any State, county, town, or other municipal corporation, should be exempt from taxation. This exempted the class of public securities to which these bonds and coupons belong. It is, indeed, said in a proviso that the intention was only to exempt State, county, town, or municipal corporations from taxation while in the exercise of the functions strictly belonging to them in their ordinary governmental and municipal capacity; but that does not, as we think, affect this case. These bonds were issued by this county in its municipal capacity, and for purposes which were declared by law to be municipal.</p>\n<p>5. As to the proof of authority from the county court.</p>\n<p>It is conceded that, under the practice in Missouri, unless the execution of the bonds was denied under oath, their execution was admitted. There was no such denial here. Hence it was only necessary to prove such facts connected with the execution as were directly put in issue by the pleadings. The only defence relied on under this branch of the case was the authority of the court to make the order it did. All else was, therefore, admitted. As the presiding judge was necessarily the president of the court, the bonds are not invalid because signed by the president as presiding judge.</p>\n<p>6. As to proof of bona fide ownership.</p>\n<p>Ownership was alleged in the petition. This ownership at the maturity of the coupons and for value was denied in the answer. This clearly made the evidence not only proper but necessary.</p>\n<p>Since all the defences relied on involved questions of law only, except that as to bona fide ownership, and the court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*733</span> correctly decided the legal propositions in favor of the plaintiff, it was not error to instruct the jury to bring in a verdict for the plaintiff if they believed he was a bona fide holder and owner of the coupons sued for.</p>\n<p>Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BLATCHFORD did not sit in this case, nor take any part in deciding it.</p>\n</div>", "id": 90634, "judges": "Waite", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/90634/", "sha1": "b933b145bdcaca6660a217dbd06fdd1061c48f7a", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:02:37"}
