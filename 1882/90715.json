The suit was begun in equity by an assignee in bankruptcy, and a purchaser of certain lands sold under an order of the bankrupt court, to restrain the defendant Crittenden from enforcing a decree in his favor against the property for $1,828.93, and the defendant Weaver from enforcing another decree in her favor for $2,348.10. The decrees to be enjoined were entirely separate and distinct from each other, one having been rendered in a suit instituted by the defendant Crittenden alone, and the other in a suit by the defendant Weaver. The two suits presented substantially the same questions for adjudication, but they were in all other respects distinct. The two decrees were rendered on the same day, and draw interest from March 6, 1879. The circuit court, in the present suit, on the twenty-fourth of October, 1881, dismissed the bill, and from a decree to that effect this appeal was taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case comes clearly within the rule stated at the present term in <i>Ex parte Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.

The mere fact that the matter in dispute arises under the constitution or laws of the United States, or treaties made, does not give us jurisdiction for the review of the judgments or decrees of the circuit or district courts.
