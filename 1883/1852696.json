JUSTICE BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>The certificate of division in this case was made on a division in opinion between the judges on a motion to quash the indictment. As a motion to quash is always addressed to the discretion of the court, a decision upon it is not error, and cannot be reviewed on a writ of error. In the case of <i>United States</i> v. <i>Rosenburgh,</i> 7 Wall. 580, we decided the precise point, that this court cannot take cognizance of a division of opinion between the judges of a circuit court upon a motion to quash an indictment. This decision was re-affirmed in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Avery,</i> 13 Wall. 251, and in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Canda,</i> decided at October term 1881.</p>\n<p><i>The case, not being properly before us, is dismissed.</i></p>\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "", "id": 1852696, "judges": "Bradley", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/1852696/", "sha1": "9265af9ba619986b072e5fab6d45618f75b7368a", "source": "L", "time_retrieved": "2013-10-30T00:37:33.156955"}
