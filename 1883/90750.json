The acts in question do contain restrictions which that court may not disregard. For instance, where it appears in the case that the claim is not one for which, consistently with the statute, a judgment can be given against the United States, it is the duty of the court to raise the question whether it is done by plea or not. To that class may be referred claims which are declared barred if not asserted within the time limited by the statute. What claims are thus barred? The express words of the statute leave no room for contention. <i>Every</i> claim&#8212;except those specially enumerated&#8212;is forever barred unless asserted within six years from the time it first accrued.

Appellant's claim, if any he has or had, accrued, within the meaning of the statute, when the government came under a legal obligation to pay the amount thereof. In other words, it accrued against the government when, had the transaction recited in the petition occurred with a citizen, it would have accrued against that citizen. That the claimant was, at that time, or any time prior to December 25, 1868, unable by reason of his connection with the rebillion&#8212;a circumstance for which the United States was in nowise responsible&#8212;to comply with the terms upon which the government had consented to be sued in the court of claims, is his misfortune, and cannot have the effect of enlarging the time fixed by the statute of limitations.
