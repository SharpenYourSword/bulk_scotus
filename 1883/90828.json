She was delivered to an agent of the claimant on      the sixth of November, 1861, and sailed for Havana in command      of a Spanish master. She was a side-wheel steamer of about      300 tons burden, built to run on a ferry between Havana and a terminus of the railroad company's      railroad. On her way down the coast she went into Port Royal,      and while there the quartermaster of the United States at      that post offered to purchase her for the use of the      government. The master declined to sell, as he had no      authority. She was then, on the twenty-ninth of November,      seized by order of Gen. Thomas W. Sherman, in command of the      United States forces. In communicating the fact of the      seizure to the adjutant general of the army, on the second of      December, the general said: 'If this steamer I have seized is      confiscated she should be left here. She is just the thing we      want, and admirably adapted for these waters and our purpose.      She is new, and exactly such a boat as they have at the      Jersey City ferry in New York. Will carry 1,000 men, and will      draw not over six or seven feet.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No judicial proceedings were instituted for her condemnation,      but at some time, before December 16th, the following      charter-party was entered into:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Articles of agreement made this ___ day of December, 1861,      between ___, captain of the steam ferry-boat Nuestra Senora      de Regla, for and on behalf of the owners of the said      ferry-boat, of the first part, and Captain Rufus Saxton, as      assistant quartermaster in the United States army, for and on      behalf of the United States of America, of the second part,      witnesseth:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'That the said party of the first part, for and in      consideration of the payment hereinafter promised to be well      and truly made by the said party of the second part, hath      chartered to the United States the steam ferry-boat Nuestra      Senora de Regla, with all her tackle, apparel, furniture, and      machinery, to be used for transporting troops, stores, or      other things, as the said party of the second part may      direct.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'And the said party of the second part both agree, for and in      consideration of the faithful performance of the above duty,      that the said party of the first part shall receive the sum      of $200 for each and every day the said boat may be kept in      service, said steam ferry-boat to be kept staunch, sound, and      strong, and her machinery in good running order and condition, by the      said party of the first part.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'It is understood by the parties to this agreement that in      case the said steam ferry-boat shall be confiscated to the      United States, then this contract shall be void; otherwise to      remain in full force and virtue.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'It is furthermore understood by the parties to this      agreement that the said steam ferry-boat is not to be run      outside of the bar of Port Royal, but at any and all points      on the rivers and creeks that connect with Broad river.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'This contract to commence on the sixteenth day of December      1861, and continue in force 10 days, after which each party      has a right to cancel the same.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'In witness whereof the undersigned have hereunto affixed      their hands and seals, at Hilton Head, S.

One witness,      competent to judge, testified to that effect, and no attempt      was made by the United States to contradict him.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The vessel was kept in the possession or under the control of      the quarter-master until the twenty-ninth of January, when      she was in form delivered to the flag officer of the navy in      command at that station. She was, however, kept in constant      use by the government as a transport, in the way contemplated      by the charter, from the sixteenth of December until about      the first of March, when she was sent to New York. No      judicial proceedings were begun against her until the ninth      of June, when a libel of information in prize was filed in      the district court for the southern district of New York by      the United States, in behalf of themselves 'and of the naval      captors in interest.' She was attached on the same day by the      marshal, and the usual monition was issued and served. The      owner filed a claim on the ninth of July. No further      proceedings were had until the twenty-second of August, when      the following order was entered: 'On reading and filing a notice of motion and a verified copy      of a letter from the secretary of the navy, stating that the      navy department desires to obtain possession of the steamer      Nuestra Senora de Regla, and on hearing Mr. E. Delafield      Smith, United States district attorney, in support of the      motion, and Mr. W. R. Beebe, proctor for the claimants, in      opposition thereto, it is hereby ordered that the said      steamer Nuestra Senora de Regla be appraised by Benjamin F.

The cause was heard on the twentieth of      June, 1863, and a decree entered directing that the vessel be      restored to the owner, but reserving all questions of costs,      and damages resulting from the capture, for future hearing      and determination. On the fifteenth of October, 1863, the      following entry was made in the cause:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'It having been mutually agreed between the counsel for the respective parties that the said vessel, in the above      decision, was immediately taken into the possession and use      of the United States under a charter-party, and delivered      them thereunder, and so remained without molestation from the      claimants, on motion of the counsel for the vessel, and with      the assent of the United States attorney, it is ordered by      the court that further proceedings and litigation be stayed      in the above cause, to the end that all questions of damages,      reserved in the decision of the court in the term of June      last, may be considered and adjusted by the government of the      United States in the application, and with the concurrence of      the government of Spain.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'SAMUEL R.

The commissioner made his report on the twentieth of May, 1871, fixing the damages for the detention at the rate of $200 a day from November 29, 1861, to June 20, 1863, the date of the decree for restoration, with interest at 6 per cent. per annum, amounting to $167,370.66 3/2, and allowing for the expenses and services of an agent, remaining with and attending to the vessel, $5,680; for counsel fee in defending the proceedings, $5,000; and for the value of the vessel at the date she should have been restored, with interest added, $36,833.33 1/3; or a total of $214,884. Exceptions were taken to this report by the United States, but they were overruled, and a decree rendered for the full amount allowed by the master, with interest added.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From that decree an appeal was taken to this court, where, at      the October term, 1872, it was decided 'that the vessel was      not lawful prize of war or subject of capture, and the      corporation which owned her is doubtless entitled to fair      indemnity for the losses sustained by the seizure and      employment of the vessel; but it may be well doubted whether      it is not more properly a subject of diplomatic adjustment      than determination by the courts.' It was also said in the      opinion: 'The decree of the district court included the sum      of $5,000 for counsel fees. We think that the amount was      greatly excessive, and the allowance for counsel fees wholly      unwarranted.' For the errors thus indicated the decree was      reversed. <i>The Nuestra Senora de Regla</i>, 17 Wall. 31. The case      was then remanded for further proceedings in accordance with      the opinion. On the twenty-second of July, 1873, after the      mandate was filed, a second reference was made to the      commissioner 'to assess the damages of the claimant of the      vessel sustained by him in consequence of the seizure and      detention of the vessel, and that on such reference all the      proofs already taken in the cause or before the referee be      used, together with such other proofs as may be put in by      either party.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this reference the commissioner again reported that the      United States continued to use the vessel after she was taken possession of by the navy department pursuant to the order of      August 22, 1862, until the twentieth of June, 1863, the date      of the decree for her restoration, and that she had never      been restored to the owners, or her value paid.

It was also impliedly settled that the capture was without probable cause, for it was said the owner was undoubtedly entitled to a fair indemnity for the losses sustained, the only difficulty being as to the amount. These questions are, therefore, no longer open. <i>Clark</i> v. <i>Keith</i>, decided at the present term, [1 SUP. CT. REP. 568;] <i>Sup'rs</i> v. <i>Kennicott</i>, 94 U.S. 499.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first of the remaining questions to be considered is whether &amp; decree can be entered against the United States for damages. As the capture was made by the army, or by the army and navy operating together, it inured exclusively to the benefit of the United States. There is no distribution of prize money in such a case. <i>U. S.</i> v. <i>Steam Vessels of War</i>, decided at this term, [1 SUP. CT. REP. 539;] <i>The Siren</i>, 13 Wall. 394. The United States were, therefore, in legal effect the captors, and they came voluntarily into court to secure for themselves the benefit of what had been done. They deliberately adopted the acts of the military and naval officers as their own, and came, as captors, to condemn their prize. Offers to purchase the vessel were made and declined before she was seized, and soon after the seizure she was chartered and put into actual use without any attempt at securing an adjudication. It is evident, also, that the capture must have been the subject of diplomatic correspondence between the government of Spain and the United States before the vessel was brought in for adjudication, because on the sixth of May, 1862, after the vessel got to New York, and before the libel was filed, Mr. Seward, the then secretary of state, wrote the district attorney for the southern district of New York as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'SIR: Noticing the arrival at New York of the Spanish steamer      Nuestra Senora de la Regla, which was seized at Port Royal by      General Sherman for an alleged illegal breach of neutrality,      I now transmit the papers found on board of her, and an      abstract of them which I caused to be prepared and which you      may find useful.' Although the libel was filed on the ninth of June, 1863, and the elaim was promptly put in, the adjudication was not had until June of the following year, when all further proceedings were stayed with the consent of both parties to await an adjustment of damages by the two governments. Nothing further was done until nearly seven years afterwards, when the secretary of state informed the Spanish government of the wish of the United States that the parties interested should apply to the court, which still retained jurisdiction, for such relief as justice demanded, and in the mode that tribunal should deem most proper and convenient. Thereupon, on motion of the claimant, and with the consent of the United States district attorney, the reference was ordered to ascertain the damages. Under these circumstances we cannot but think the United States have voluntarily submitted themselves to the court at the instance of the Spanish government, and with the consent of the claimant, for the purpose of having the questions of damages growing out of the capture judicially settled according to the rules applicable to private persons in like cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is objected, however, that the executive department of the government had no power, in the absence of express legislative authority, to make such a submission. It was the duty of the United States, under the law of nations, to bring all captured vessels into a prize court for adjudication. If that had not been done in this instance, the Spanish government would have had just cause of complaint, and could have demanded reparation for the wrongs that had been done one of its subjects. The executive department had the right to bring the suit. In that suit it had been determined that the capture was unlawful. Necessarily, therefore, the question of damages to the owner of the captured vessel arose. Since, without the consent of the United States, no judgment for damages could be rendered against them in the pending suit that could be enforced by execution, the Spanish government had the right to assume the prosecution of the claim, and it did. Necessarily the negotiations on the part of the United States under this claim were conducted by the executive. After long delay no agreement was reached, and as a last resort for ending the controversy it was determined to refer the whole matter to the court for judicial inquiry and determination. We see no reason why this might not be done in such a case. It is true, any judgment that may be rendered cannot be judicially enforced, but the questions to be settled are judicial in their character, and are incidents to the suit which the United States were required to bring to enforce their rights as captors. It is too late now to insist that the case is not one of prize, because in the libel it is expressly alleged that the vessel was captured as lawful prize, and condemnation was asked on that account. When, therefore, the United States, through the executive of the nation, waived their right to exemption from suit, and asked the prize court to complete the adjudication of a cause which was rightfully begun in that jurisdiction, we think the government is bound by the submission, and that it is the duty of the court to proceed to the final determination of all the questions legitimately involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next inquiry is as to the amount of damages. The duty of a captor is to institute judicial proceedings for the condemnation of his prize without unnecessary delay, and if he fails in this the court may, in case of restitution, decree demurrage against him as damages. This rule is well settled. 2 Wheat. App. 11; <i>The Appollon</i>, 9 Wheat. 377; <i>The Lively</i>, 1 Gall. 327; <i>The Corier Maritimo</i>, 1 Rob. 287.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the facts in this case there can be no doubt of the propriety of such an allowance for the extraordinary detention of the vessel before she was delivered up for adjudication, especially since she was detained for the express purpose of use by the United States. And as to the amount of the allowance there is no opportunity for discussion. The United States were willing and actually contracted to pay $200 a day for her use if she was not in fact lawful prize, and that is shown to have been a reasonable price for her charter at the time. She was seized on the twenty-ninth of November, and it is fair to assume that if due diligence had been used she might have been surrendered for adjudication by the sixteenth of December, when her charter began to run. She was not actually surrendered until the ninth of June&#8212;a delay of 175 days beyond what was necessary. It is not disputed that her value at that time was $30,000. She cost when built $50,000, and was new when captured. As she has never been restored under the order to that effect, there can be no doubt of the liability of the United States for her value, when at their request she was delivered into their possession by the court. It is not a matter of any importance that the certificate of deposit in the treasury of the amount of her appraised value was not filed. By taking the vessel on the terms imposed by the court, the United States impliedly agreed to restore her in as good condition as she was when taken, or pay her value in money.

CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court. After reciting the facts as above stated he continued:</p>\n<p>That the steamer was not lawful prize or the subject of capture was expressly decided on the former appeal. It was also impliedly settled that the capture was without probable cause, for it was said that the owner was undoubtedly entitled to a fair indemnity for the losses sust√°ined, the only difficulty being as to the amount. These questions are, therefore, no longer open. Clark v. Keith, 106 U.S. 464; Supervisors v. Kennicott, 94 U.S. 499.</p>\n<p>The first of the remaining questions to be considered is whether a decree can be entered against the United States for damages. As the capture was made by the army, or by the army and navy operating together, it inured exclusively to the benefit of the United States. There is no distribution of prize money in such a case. Porter v. United States, 106 U.S. 607; The Siren, 13 Wall. 389. The United States were, therefore, in legal effect the captors, and they came voluntarily into court to secure for themselves the benefit of what had been done. They deliberately adopted the acts of the military and naval officers as their own, and came, as captors, to condemn their prize. Offers to purchase the vessel were made and declined before she was seized, and soon after the seizure she was chartered and put into actual use without any attempt at securing an adjudication. It is evident, also, that the capture must have been the subject of diplomatic correspondence between the government of Spain and the United States before the vessel was brought in for adjudication, because on the 6th of May, 1862, after the vessel got to New York, and before the libel was filed, Mr. Seward, the then secretary of State, wrote the district attorney for the Southern District of New York, as follows:</p>\n<p>\"SIR: Noticing the arrival at New York of the Spanish steamer Nuestra Se√±ora de la Regla, which was seized at Port Royal by General Sherman for an alleged illegal breach of neutrality, I now transmit the papers found on board of her, and an abstract of them which I caused to be prepared and which you may find useful.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*102</span> Although the libel was filed on the 9th of June, 1862, and the claim was promptly put in, the adjudication was not had until June of the following year, when all further proceedings were stayed with the consent of both parties to await an adjustment of damages by the two governments. Nothing further was done until nearly seven years afterwards, when the secretary of State informed the Spanish government of the wish of the United States that the parties interested should apply to the court, which still retained jurisdiction, for such relief as justice demanded, and in the mode that tribunal should deem most proper and convenient. Thereupon, on motion of the claimant, and with the consent of the United States district attorney, the reference was ordered to ascertain the damages. Under these circumstances we cannot but think the United States have voluntarily submitted themselves to the court at the instance of the Spanish government, and with the consent of the claimant, for the purpose of having the questions of damages growing out of the capture judicially settled according to the rules applicable to private persons in like cases.</p>\n<p>It is objected, however, that the executive department of the government had no power, in the absence of express legislative authority, to make such a submission. It was the duty of the United States, under the law of nations, to bring all captured vessels into a prize court for adjudication. If that had not been done in this instance, the Spanish government would have had just cause of complaint, and could have demanded reparation for the wrongs that had been done one of its subjects. The executive department had the right to bring the suit. In that suit it had been determined that the capture was unlawful. Necessarily, therefore, the question of damages to the owner of the captured vessel arose. Since, without the consent of the United States, no judgment for damages could be rendered against them in the pending suit that could be enforced by execution, the Spanish government had the right to assume the prosecution of the claim, and it did. Necessarily the negotiations on the part of the United States under this claim were conducted by the executive. After long delay no agreement was reached, and as a last resort for ending the controversy, it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*103</span> was determined to refer the whole matter to the court for judicial inquiry and determination. We see no reason why this might not be done in such a case. It is true any judgment that may be rendered cannot be judicially enforced, but the questions to be settled are judicial in their character, and are incidents to the suit which the United States were required to bring to enforce their rights as captors. It is too late now to insist that the case is not one of prize, because in the libel it is expressly alleged that the vessel was captured as lawful prize, and condemnation was asked on that account. When, therefore, the United States, through the executive of the nation, waived their right to exemption from suit, and asked the prize court to complete the adjudication of a cause which was rightfully begun in that jurisdiction, we think the government is bound by the submission, and that it is the duty of the court to proceed to the final determination of all the questions legitimately involved.</p>\n<p>The next inquiry is as to the amount of damages. The duty of a captor is to institute judicial proceedings for the condemnation of his prize without unnecessary delay, and if he fails in this the court may, in case of restitution, decree demurrage against him as damages. This rule is well settled. Slocum v. Mayberry, 2 Wheat. 1; The Apollon, 9 Wheat. 362; The Lively, 1 Gall. 314; The Corier Maritimo, 1 Rob. 287.</p>\n<p>Upon the facts in this case there can be no doubt of the propriety of such an allowance for the extraordinary detention of the vessel before she was delivered up for adjudication, especially since she was detained for the express purpose of use by the United States. And as to the amount of the allowance, there is no opportunity for discussion. The United States were willing and actually contracted to pay $200 a day for her use if she was not in fact lawful prize, and that is shown to have been a reasonable price for her charter at the time: She was seized on the 29th of November, and it is fair to assume that if due diligence had been used she might have been surrendered for adjudication by the 16th of December, when her charter began to run. She was not actually surrendered until the 9th of June ¬ó a delay of 175 days beyond what was necessary. It <span class=\"star-pagination\">*104</span> is not disputed that her value at that time was $30,000. She cost when built $50,000, and was new when captured. As she has never been restored under the order to that effect, there can be no doubt of the liability of the United States for her value, when at their request she was delivered into their possession by the court. It is not a matter of any importance that the certificate of deposit in the treasury of the amount of her appraised value was not filed. By taking the vessel on the terms imposed by the court, the United States impliedly agreed to restore her in as good condition as she was when taken, or pay her value in money. By the surrender of the vessel for adjudication, the United States relieved themselves from any further liability for damages in the way of demurrage, and became bound for the vessel instead.</p>\n<p>The allowance for demurrage includes reasonable compensation for the pay and expenses of an agent to look after the interests of the owners up to the time of the delivery of the vessel to the navy department by the court.
