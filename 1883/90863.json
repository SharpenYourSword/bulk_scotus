In the same spirit, congress has exempted from all duty the importation of 'paintings, statues, fountains, and other works of art' which are either 'the production of American artists,' or are 'imported expressly for presentation to national institutions, or to any state, or to any municipal corporation.'

An artist's copies of antique masterpieces are works of art of as high a grade as those executed by the same hand from original models of modern sculptors. The instructions of the treasury department (pursuant to which these duties were imposed) and the argument for the appellant proceed upon the ground that the statues were made by men not really professional sculptors, though calling themselves such, and were not real works of art, but mere manufactures of marble by good artisans. If this court were at liberty to consider the testimony sent up with the record, it might, perhaps, not reach the conclusion at which the jury have arrived.
