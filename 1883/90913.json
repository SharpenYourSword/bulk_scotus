The act of June 21, 1879, (21 Stat. 23,) making appropriations for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, appriated 'the same sums of money and for like purpose (and continuing the same provisions relating thereto) as were appropriated for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1879,' by the act above referred to, making appropriations for that year. With the exception of the words 'in full compensation,' the opening clause of these acts is substantially the same as that used in all other appropriation acts of every description since the foundation of the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon this state of the statute law the question is presented whether from June 30, 1877, up to and including November 26, 1879, the appellee was entitled to a salary at the rate of $3,000 per annum, or at the rate of $2,600 per annum. The contention of appellee is that under the act of June 17, 1870, he was entitled to the salary of $3,000, notwithstanding the subsequent legislation above referred to. We cannot concur in this view. The act of June 17, 1870, fixing the annual salary of appellee at $3,000, was not a contract that the salary should not be reduced during his term of office. <i>Butler</i> v. <i>Pennsylvania</i>, 10 How. 402. Nor was there any provision of the constitution which forbade a reduction. <i>Clinton</i> v. <i>Engelbrecht</i>, 13 Wall. 434.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress, therefore, could, without the violation of any contract, reduce the salary of appellee, and had the constitutional power to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certain well-settled rules of interpretation are applicable to this case. One is that a legislative act is to be interpreted according to the intention of the legislature apparent upon its face, (<i>Wilkinson</i> v. <i>Leland</i>, 2 Pet. 627;) another, that, if possible, effect must be given to every clause, section, and word of the statute, (Bac. Abr. St. I. 2; <i>Powlter's Case</i>, 11 Coke, 29<i>a</i>, 34<i>a</i>; Potter's Dwarris, St. 194; <i>Op. Justices</i>, 22 Pick. 571;) and a third, that where two acts are in irreconcilable conflict the later repeals the earlier act, even though there be no express repeal. <i>McCool</i> v. <i>Smith</i>, 1 Black, 459; <i>U. S.</i> v. <i>Tynen</i>, 11 Wall. 88; <i>Red Rock</i> v. <i>Henry</i>, 106 U. S. 596; [S. C. 1 SUP. CT. REP. 434;] <i>U. S.</i> v. <i>Irwim</i>, 5 McLean, 178; <i>West</i> v. <i>Pine</i>, 4 Wash. C.

Placing side by side the two clauses of the statute which relate to this controversy, their plain effect is to appropriate $2,600 for the salary of the appellee for one year, and to declare that the sum so appropriated shall be in full compensation for his services as chief justice for the year specified. There is no ambiguity and no room for construction. We cannot adopt the view of appellee unless we eliminate from the statute the words 'in full compensation,' which congress, abandoning the long-used form of the appropriation acts has, <i>ex industria</i>, inserted. Our duty is to give them effect. When congress has said that the sum appropriated shall be in full compensation of the services of the appellee, we cannot say that it shall not be in full compensation, and allow him a greater sum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only do the words of the statute make the intention of congress manifest, but that intention is plainly repugnant to the former statute, which fixes the yearly salary of the chief justice at $3,000. It is impossible that both acts should stand. No ingenuity can reconcile them. The later act must therefore prevail, and the earlier act must, for the time covered by the appropriation acts above referred to, be considered as suspended. The result of these views is that the judgment of the court of claims, which gives the appellant a salary at the rate of $3,000 per annum from June 30, 1877, to November 26, 1879, must be reversed, and the case remanded to the court of claims with directions to dismiss the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>109 U.S. 143 (1883)</b></center>\n<center><h1>UNITED STATES<br>\nv.<br>\nFISHER.</h1></center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Submitted March 30th, 1883.</center>\n<center>Decided November 5th, 1883.</center>\nAPPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*144</span> <i>Mr. Solicitor-General Phillips</i> for the United States.</p>\n<p><i>Mr. J.
