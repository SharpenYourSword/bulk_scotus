CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court. He stated the facts in the foregoing language and continued:</p>\n<p>The judgment below was clearly right. The Columbus, Chicago &amp; Indiana Central Company was, in equity, the owner of the property when the lease was made and when the Pittsburg, Cincinnati &amp; St. Louis Company went into possession under it. The deed executed in February, 1872, pursuant to the contract of purchase, converted the equitable title of the Columbus, Chicago &amp; Indiana Central Company into a legal title, which at once, by operation of law, inured to the benefit of the Pittsburg, Cincinnati &amp; St. Louis Company under its lease. All the rights of William B. Skidmore, as against the property, accrued long after those of the Pittsburg, Cincinnati &amp; St. Louis Company and are subject to the title of that company. Such being the case, it is entirely unnecessary to inquire whether the Skidmores acquired a valid title to the property as against the Columbus, Chicago &amp; Indiana Central Company. The Pittsburg, Cincinnati &amp; St. Louis Company is entitled to the possession, whether that title be good or bad.</p>\n<p><i>The judgment is affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "", "id": 1695921, "judges": "Waite", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/1695921/", "sha1": "6f887d9aa7064cdb276bf3bd85d2616e50dd0f85", "source": "L", "time_retrieved": "2013-10-30T00:08:56.309357"}
