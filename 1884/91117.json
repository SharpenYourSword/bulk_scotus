The appellant does not deny the priority of location, or the continuous work on the Nabob,&#8212;the claim of the appellee,&#8212;but insists that the notice and description of the claim of the defendants were not sufficient to apprise other porspectors of its precise location. This, in the first place, is matter of fact, and was found by the court below against appellant; for we think that the following language, though called by the judge a conclusion of law, is really a finding of facts, namely: '(1) That the notice of the location of Nabob mining claim contained a sufficient description by reference to natural objects, and permanent and well-known monuments, to identify the same; (2) that said Nabob claim was so marked on the ground that its boundaries could be readily placed.' If, however, we revert to the specific findings of fact, so named in the record, we think the second and fourth findings, which give a more minute description of the courses, distances, natural objects, and stakes, justify the two conclusions above recited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A point is made by appellant that the Flagstaff Mining Company was in possession of the lode at the time the Nabob claim was located. We do not see how this would improve the subsequent location of appellant. But it is sufficient to say that no such finding is made by the court in regard to the Flagstaff claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By chapter 80 of the acts of congress, approved April 7, 1874, (Supp. Rev.
