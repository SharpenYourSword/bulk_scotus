J. for a writ of <i>mandamus</i> requiring the circuit court of the United States for the district of Indiana to amend a judgment entered January 20, 1883, in a cause wherein the relators were plaintiffs, and Frederick Eggers, defendant, 'so as to conform to the complaint in said cause, and to the finding or verdict of the court rendered upon the trial of said cause.' The suit was ejectment to recover the possession of 'all of the north part of lot 2, in sec. 36, T. 38 N., R. 10 W. of the second principal meridian, which lies west of the track of the Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railroad, and north of a line parallel with the north line of said lot 2, and seven hundred and fifty-three feet south therefrom.' The judgment entry, which includes the only finding in the case, is as follows: 'And the court, having heard the evidence and being fully advised, finds for the plaintiffs, and orders and adjudges that they are entitled to, and shall have and recover of defendant, the possession of so much of said lot two (2) as lies south of the south line of lot number one, (1,) as indicated by a fence constructed and maintained by the defendant as and on said south line, said fence running from the state line easterly to Lake Michigan; and assessing the damages at $1 and costs taxed at $_____, which the plaintiffs shall recover of defendant. All of which is finally ordered, adjudged, and decreed.' After this entry the petitioner moved the court to amend and reform the judgment so that it would 'conform to the complaint in said court and to the finding or verdict;' but the court, on full consideration, decided that the finding and judgment were not separate and distinct, and that the meaning was clear. The entry was to be construed as finding and adjudging that the plaintiffs were only entitled to recover the possession of so much of the premises sued for as lies south of the fence indicated. For this reason the motion was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is an elementary rule that a writ of <i>mandamus</i> may be used to require an inferior court to decide a matter within its jurisdiction and pending before it for judicial determination, but not to control the decision. <i>Ex parte Flippin</i>, 94 U.
