According to the petition, the court entertained jurisdiction of the cause, but dismissed it for want of due prosecution; that is to say, because errors had not been assigned in accordance with the rules of practice applicable to the form of the action. This is a judgment which can only be reviewed by writ of error or appeal, as the case may be. Mandamus lies to compel a court to take jurisdiction in a proper case, but not to control its discretion while acting within its jurisdiction. This rule is elementary. <i>Ex parte Morgan,</i> 114 U.S. 174, and cases cited.</p>\n<p><i>Motion denied.</i></p>\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "", "id": 2409992, "judges": "Waite", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2409992/", "sha1": "e86e3d356b649fccc54d84a3f7d8b6bf9048c700", "source": "L", "time_retrieved": "2013-10-30T02:24:39.637620"}
