An section 12, so far as relevant, provides: 'Every cask or other package from which the stamp for imported liquors required by this act to be placed thereon shall not be effaced, obliterated, or destroyed, on emptying such package, shall be forfeited, and the same may be seized by any officer of internal revenue wherever found; and all the provisions and penalties of section thirty-three hundred and twenty-four of the Revised Statutes of the United States, relating to empty casks or packages from which the marks, brands, or stamps have not been effaced or obliterated, and relating to the removal of stamps from packages, and to having in possession any stamps so removed, shall apply to the stamps for imported spirits herein provided for, and to the casks or other packages on which such stamps shall have been used.' Section 3324 of the Revised Statutes, referred to in section 12 of the foregoing act, is in these words: 'Every person who empties or draws off, or causes to be emptied or drawn off, any distilled spirits from a cask or package bearing any mark, brand, or stamp, required by law, shall, at the time of emptying such cask or package, efface and obliterate said mark, stamp, or brand. Every such cask or package from which said mark, brand, or stamp is not effaced and obliterated as herein required, shall be forfeited to the United States, and may be seized by any officer of internal revenue wherever found. And every railroad company or other transportation company, or person who receives or transports, or has in possession with intent to transport, or with intent to cause or procure to be transported, any such empty cask or package, or any part thereof, having thereon any brand, mark, or stamp, required by law to be placed on any cask or package containing distilled spirits, shall forfeit three hundred dollars for each such cask or package, or any part thereof, so received or transported, or had in possession with the intent aforesaid; and every boat, railroad car, cart, dray, wagon, or other vehicle, and all horses and other animals used in carrying or transporting the same, shall be forfeited to the United States. Every person who fails to efface and obliterate said mark, stamp, or brand, at the time of emptying such cask or package, or who receives any such cask or package, or any part thereof, with the intent aforesaid, or who transports the same, or knowingly aids or assists therein, or who removes any stamp provided by law from any cask or package containing, or which had contained, distilled spirits, without defacing and destroying the same at the time of such removal, or who aids or assists therein, or who has in his possession any such stamp so removed as aforesaid, or has in his possession any canceled stamp, or any stamp which has been used, or which purports to have been used, upon any cask or package of distilled spirits, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and shall be fined not less than five hundred dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars, and imprisoned not less than one year nor more than five years.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was brought into this court by the following certificate:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'At a stated term of the circuit court of the United States      of America for the Southern district of New York, in the      Second circuit, begun and held at the United States courtrooms, in the city of New York, on the third Monday of      October, in the year of our Lord 1884.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Present, the Honorable WILLIAM J.

The prosecution on      the trial having failed to prove that the stamps named in the      indictment were removed by a person, was it or not error for      the court to refuse to direct the jury to acquit the      defendant on the ground that the prosecution had not proven      an offense under the statute? <i>Fourth</i>.

St. &#167; 3324, defining such offenses in relation to stamps upon packages of other distilled spirits, not imported, and applying them in the case of imported liquors. In doing this its language is that of reference merely, and not of definition. For the precise and statutory description of the offense described we must have recourse to the words of Rev. St. &#167; 3324, in the context there found, there being nothing in the act of 1879 showing an intention to qualify their original meaning. Referring for that purpose to the section of the Revised Statutes in question, we find that the felonies therein defined are as follows: (1) The removal by any person of any stamp provided by law from any cask or package containing, or which had contained, distilled spirits without defacing and destroying the same at the time of such removal, or aiding or assisting therein. (2) Having in possession any such stamp so removed as aforesaid. (3) Having in possession any canceled stamp, or any stamp which has been used, or which purports to have been used, upon any cask or package of distilled spirits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of these the offenses described in the last division are not adopted by the act of March 1, 1879, and applied to casks or packages of imported liquors. It is not an offense, therefore, under this act, for one merely to have in his possession any canceled stamp provided by law to be affixed to each package of imported liquors, or any stamp which has been used on such package, or which purports to have been so used. To constitute the offense of unlawfully having in possession any such stamps they must have been removed from the package on which they were once placed without being defaced and destroyed at the time of such removal. But every such stamp, once in use upon such package, to come afterwards into the possession of a person, must in one sense have been removed; that is, must in some way and by some means have ceased to be affixed to the package on which it was used, and have become detached and separated from it. This may have happened without the agency of a human will, by mere accident, or as the effect of unintelligent causes, and without design on the part of any person. But it is not in this sense that possession of removed stamps is made an offense in the previous clause of the section; for so to construe it would be to obliterate the statutory distinction between the two crimes,&#8212;that of having in possession removed stamps, and of having in possession used stamps. A stamp once in use may have accidentally fallen off the package, yet afterwards to have it in possession is an offense under section 3324. But it is not an offense under the act of March 1, 1879. To have in possession stamps that have been removed, without at the time of removal having been defaced and destroyed, is an offense under both laws,&#8212;one in the case of domestic distilled spirits, the other in that of imported liquors. The removal, therefore, which describes a removed stamp, possession of which is thus made unlawful, must be a designed removal from the package by human agency, without defacing and destroying it at the time; such removal as by the first division of the described offenses constitutes the guilty act of the person removing it. It is the possession of such a stamp, 'so removed as aforesaid,' in the language of the clause defining the offense, that must be shown to constitute guilt; that is, possession of a stamp, not merely once used and afterwards found and taken into possession, but possession of a stamp, which some person, although he may be unknown, has removed intentionally and by design, and failed, by neglect or otherwise, at the time of removal, to deface and destroy. So to remove such a stamp is one offense; to aid and assist in such a removal is another; the third is, to have in possession such a stamp, 'so removed as aforesaid;' and these are all of that class of offenses embraced by the twelfth section of the act of March 1, 1879.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It follows, from this view of the law, that the indictment in the present case is substantially defective, because it does not set out an offense under the statute. It does not describe the crime intended in the language of the act, inasmuch as it does not charge that the defendant had in his possession a stamp of the kind and description mentioned, which stamp had been theretofore removed in the manner prohibited by the law; that is, by some person, without defacing and destroying the same at the time of such removal. It also follows that whatever presumptions may arise as to the manner of removal, when properly charged, from the circumstances in proof accompanying the fact of possession, it is competent for the defendant to introduce evidence in explanation of those circumstances, and tending to show that the stamp in question was not removed by any person, without defacing and destroying the same at the time of removal, but was in fact detached and removed from the cask or package without human agency, and by the accidental intervention of other causes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proceeding to dispose of the questions certified specifically, we answer the first, fourth, fifth, and eighth questions in the negative, and the seventh in the affirmative.
