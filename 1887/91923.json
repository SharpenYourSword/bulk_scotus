Certainly the provision of the constitution referred to cannot have the effect of taking away from the states the power of giving a court of equity jurisdiction in cases requiring equitable relief. It may be true that in Pennsylvania 'equity powers have been doled out to the courts by the legislature with a sparing hand,' but there is nothing in the constitution of the United States which requires that this should always be so. The suit of which complaint is made in this case was brought to establish a trust in the holder of the legal title, which from time immemorial has been a proper subject o  chancery jurisdiction. It is useless to contend that the constitution of the United States prevents any state from giving a court of equity the power to hear and determine such a case.
