On the 16th day of January, 1888, an appeal was prayed by the United States to this court and allowed, and the transcript filed in the clerk's office October 27, 1888. Davis filed his petition in the same court September 2, 1887, and recovered judgment November 18, 1887, in the sum of $25 and costs, from which an appeal was prayed to this court January 16, 1888, and the transcript filed in the clerk's office October 27, 1888. A motion to dismiss is filed in each of these cases on behalf of the appellees, respectively, upon the ground that an appeal will not lie to this court from a district court performing the appropriate duty of a district court, and that this court has not jurisdiction to re-examine judgments of circuit or district courts since the act of February 16, 1875, (18 St. 316,) in such actions, unless the matter in dispute shall exceed the sum or value of $5,000, exclusive of costs, and 'that the United States are not entitled to a writ of error or appeal if the same remedy would not be afforded under similar circumstances to a private party.' By the act under which these suits were brought the district court was given concurrent jurisdiction with the court of claims as to matters of which that court had jurisdiction, 'where the amount of the claim does not exceed one thousand dollars,' and the same right of appeal was given to the plaintiff or the United States as 'now reserved in the statutes of the United States in that behalf made.' Section 707 of the Revised Statutes reads: 'An appeal to the supreme court shall be allowed, on behalf of the United States, from all judgments of the court of claims adverse to the United States, and on behalf of the plaintiff in any case where the amount in controversy exceeds three thousand dollars, or where his claim is forfeited to the United States by the judgment of said court, as provided in section one thousand and eighty-nine.' By section 708 such appeals must be taken within 90 days after the judgment is rendered, but this period is enlarged to 6 months by section 10 of the act in question. Inasmuch as the object of the latter act was to enable the district and circuit courts to exercise concurrent jurisdiction with the court of claims in respect to suits against the United States, as therein provided, in our judgment the right of appeal reserved to the government 'in the statutes of the United States in that behalf made,' before the enactment of this act, was the right of appeal reserved in the statutes relating to the court of claims, and, as that right could be exercised by the United States in the instance of any judgment of the court of claims adverse to the United States, it follows that the same right can be exercised by the United States in any case of the prosecution of a claim in the district or circuit courts of the United States under said act. The result is that the motions to dismiss in these cases must be overruled.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>131 U.S. 36 (1889)</b></center>\n<center><h1>UNITED STATES<br>\nv.<br>\nDAVIS.<br>\nUNITED STATES<br>\nv.<br>\nSCHOFIELD.</h1></center>\n<center>Nos. 1425, 1426.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Submitted April 1, 1889.</center>\n<center>Decided May 13, 1889.</center>\nAPPEALS FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND.\n<p><i>Mr. Charles C.
