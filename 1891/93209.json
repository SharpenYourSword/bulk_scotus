An appeal was taken to the court of appeals, and the judgment affirmed, (125 N. Y. 740, 26 N. E. Rep. 933;) whereupon, March 6, 1891, the court of sessions ordered the judgment of conviction and sentence of death to be executed and enforced in the manner provided by law, and issued a second warrant to the warden.

Petitioner claimed that by his imprisonment under the first warrant he had been once punished for the offense for which he had been convicted, and that solitary confinement amounted to cruel and unusual punishment, and hence that he was restrained in violation of the fifth and eighth amendments to the constitution of the United States; and he objected, also, that the warrant was not sufficiently definite and specific.
