A motion was made by complainant December 24th to amend, and on January 7, 1889, a motion by defendant to dismiss. On January 28, 1889, leave to amend was granted, and the motion to dismiss denied, and on February 2, 1889, the amendments were made. These consisted in the insertion of the word 'jointly' in the allegation of the defendants' infringement, and also of the following allegation: 'Your orator further states that all of the defendants above named are inhabitants of the city and county of New York; that the defendant the Hamburg-American Packet Company has its principal business office in this country, located in the city and county of New York; that the defendants Henry R.

Metcalfe's Case, 11 Coke, 38, was cited, where it was held that a record of the common pleas could not be removed into the king's bench before the whole matter was determined in the common pleas, as it was entire, and could not be in both courts at the same time; and also Peet v. McGraw, 21 Wend. 667, wherein Mr. Justice Nelson, then chief justice of New York, declared that a case could not be sent up in fragments by a succession of writs of error. Again, in Holcombe v. McKusick, 20 How. 552, it was said: 'It is the settled principle of this court, and the same in the king's bench in England, that the writ will not lie until the whole of the matters in controversy in the suit below are disposed of.

In the latter case it was held that a final decree on the merits cannot be made separately against one of several defendants upon a joint charge against all, where the case is still pending as to the others. It is true that there a default had been entered with a decree pro confesso against one of several defendants, and a final decree had been made absolute against him, whereupon the court proceeded to try the issues made by the answers of the other defendants, and dismissed complainant's bill; but this attitude of the case illustrated and required the application of the general rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Withenbury v.

Anderson, 21 How. 386, where the district court of the United States sitting in admiralty decreed that a sum of money was due, but the amount to be paid was dependent upon other claims that might be established, it was held that such a decree was not final.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are cases in equity in which a decree, disposing of every ground of contention between the parties except as to the ascertainment of an amount in a matter separable from the other subjects of controversy, and relating only to some of the defendants, may be treated as final, though retained for the determination of such severable matter. Hill v. Railroad Co., 140 U. S. 52, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 690. But this case presents no such aspect.

The ground on which our jurisdiction was invoked was the inadequacy of any other remedy, and it was argued that as the cause could proceed as to the other defendants, no final judgment could be entered upon the order of the Circuit Court, and no appeal taken therefrom.</p>\n<p>Under the circumstances</p>\n<p><i>This appeal must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction, and it is so ordered.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 93557, "judges": "Fuller", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/93557/", "sha1": "28e39fe3f16495c77cc2fb9850e76c3a57ec5d2c", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:07:38"}
