This was originally a civil action, brought, under the Code of Civil Procedure of Ohio, in the court of common pleas of Logan county, by George W. Harshman, asking a personal judgment against John A. Nash on a note of $26,000, and setting up the execution of a mortgage by Nash to secure the same; also, alleging the subsequent conveyance of the mortgaged premises by Nash to Charles A. Dupee, who, with others, was made a defendant. Nash and Dupee filed answers, and, after the case was at issue it was removed to the circuit court for the northern district of Ohio, under the local prejudice act. In that court the action proceeded merely as a suit in equity to foreclose the mortgage, and a decree was rendered for the sale of the lands. From this decree, Nash appeals.
