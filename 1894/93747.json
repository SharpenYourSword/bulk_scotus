We have already held that an appeal or writ of error lies to this court from or to the decrees of judgments of the supreme court of the territories, except in cases susceptible of being taken to the circuit courts of appeals, and cases where the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, does not exceed the sum of $5,000.
