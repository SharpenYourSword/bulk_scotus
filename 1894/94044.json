These grants were bestowed by the state of Michigan, separately, on the Marquette and Ontonagon Companies. The rule is that where two lines of road are aided by land grants made by the same act, and the lines of those roads cross or intersect, the lands within the 'place' limits of both, at the crossing or intersection, do not pass to either company, in preference to the other, no matter which line may be first located, or road built, but pass, in equal, undivided moieties, to each. St. Paul &amp; S. C. R. Co. v. Winona &amp; St. P. R. Co., 112 U. S. 720, 5 Sup. Ct. 334; Sioux City &amp; St. P. R. Co. v. Chicago, M. &amp; St. P. Ry. Co., 117 U. S. 406, 6 Sup. Ct. 790. This rule was evidently in the mind of congress when it passed the confirmatory act of 1889, for in the last sentence of section 4 there is a provision that a moiety forfeited on account of the noncompletion of one main or branch line should not inure to the benefit of the completed line. When, therefore, the roads from Marquette and Ontonagon, respectively, to the state line, were duly located, the lands within six miles of both, at the intersection, became appropriated, in equal, undivided moieties, to aid in the construction of each. The fact of the consolidation of the Marquette and the Ontonagon Companies with the Fond du Lac Company, and the further fact that the map of definite location was prepared and filed by the consolidated company, in no manner affect this rule of appropriation. The lands were granted by the United States to the state for the accomplishment of specified purposes, and those purposes could not be defeated by the state, or by any corporations, beneficiaries under the state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may be that the release of the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway Company, at that time the beneficial owner of both the Marquette and the Ontonagon grants, operated to relinquish to the state of Michigan the title to all the lands within such grants, but the only release authorized by the legislature of the state of Michigan was of the lands granted to aid in the construction of the road from Marquette to the Wisconsin state line. This authorized no giving up of the grant in aid of the construction of the road from Ontonagon to the state line, and as that held an undivided moiety of the lands at the crossing, to that extent, at least, it still remained after all the releases. It may be a novel condition which resulted, in that it left the state and the United States joint owners, each holding the title to an undivided moiety of this body of lands, and it may be that further evidence may place the case in a different attitude; but, on the record as it now stands, it would seem that the plaintiff and the defendant were each the owners of an undivided half of the land in controversy.
