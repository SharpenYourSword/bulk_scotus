March 4, 1895.  Frederick Hall and J. A. Maguire, for plaintiffs in error.  djQ  Mr. Justice FIELD delivered the opinion of the court.  This case comes before us on writ of error from the supreme court of California. It was an action originally brought by the plaintiff in the superior court of one of the counties of that state, claiming an equitable right to 110.80 acres of land, which is part of 160 acres of public land, for which a preemp-</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p>[388]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>tion claim was filed by one John Mann, through whom the plaintiffs in error claim as heirs at law; charging the defendant as trustee of the legal title, and praying that he be compelled to transfer it to them, as the true owners thereof.  The defendant demurred to the complaint, and had judgment thereon. The plaintiffs stood upon the sufficiency of their complaint, and appealed from the judgment of the inferior court, which was, however, affirmed. 18 Pac. 670.  From the latter judgment the case is brought to this court on a writ of error.  Mann, through whom the plaintiffs in error claim, as heirs, was a qualified preemptor on 160 acres of unsurveyed public land in Sonoma county, Cal., which embraced the 110.80 acres in controversy here. He made improvements upon the land, and resided upon it until his death, which took place in July, 1872. He died intestate.  The township in which the 160 acres were situated was afterwards surveyed, and an approved plat thereof was filed in the United States land office in San Francisco in August, 1880.  In October, following, one of the plaintiffs, on behalf of the heirs of Mann, filed with the register and receiver of the land office a declaratory statement, claiming the right to pre-empt, for the benefit and use of the heirs, 160 acres of land.  In November, 1880, the defendant in error filed in the land office an application claiming, as a homestead, a certain portion of the land, which included the 110.80 acres. The defendant had entered upon the land in dispute in 1870, without the consent of Mann or the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>No entry of any kind was made by the defendant, prior to</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>1870, upon the premises. He claimed the right to purchase the land under the provisions of section 7 of the act of congress of July 23, 1866, entitled 'An act to quiet land titles in California.' The object of that section was to withdraw from the general operation of the pre-emption laws lands continuously possessed and improved by a purchaser under a Mexican grant, which was subsequently rejected, or limited to a less quantity than that embraced in the boundaries designated, and to give to him, to the exclusion of all other claimants, the right to obtain the title. The land applied for by both parties, to the extent of 110.80 acres, was within the exterior boundary of the Mexican grant known as 'Agua Caliente,' but which was excluded by the final survey of the United States. The defendant was a purchaser of the land thus excluded, for a valuable consideration, from parties who purchased from the original grantee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record contains a description of the grant, and sets forth the various proceedings for its recognition and confirmation and survey, which we follow in the history of the proceedings, as substantially correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grant was made to Lazaro Pina by Alvarado, as governor of California, in October, 1840, and was approved by the departmental assembly in October, 1845.
