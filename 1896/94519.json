To the indictment he entered a special plea in the nature of a plea in abatement, to the effect that the indictment was not found until March 10, 1896; that Miller died January 21, 1892, in Cuba, without the United States, and that, under and by virtue of section 1043 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, he could not be prosecuted or tried, that from January 17, 1892, until the date of the finding of the indictment, he had not fled from justice, but had been confined in a prison at Havana, Cuba, upon a charge of assault inflicted in that city; and that, therefore, the offense with which he was charged by the indictment was barred by the statute of limitations. To this plea the United States interposed a demurrer, and argument was had thereon, whereupon the judges of the circuit court (the court being held by a circuit judge and a district judge) announced that they were divided in opinion upon certain questions of law arising on the demurrer; and the points upon which the judges disagreed were, at the request of the United States, certified to this court. The case was submitted on a motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the judiciary act of March 3, 1891, it was provided that this court should not have appellate jurisdiction by appeal, by writ of error, or otherwise, over the circuit courts, except according to the provisions of the act, and jurisdiction was specifically given in 'cases of conviction for a capital or otherwise infamous crime.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In U.

It is true that in that case the defendants had been found guilty, and that the certificate of division was on a motion for new trial. The general rule was that this court could not, upon a certificate of division of opinion, acquire jurisdiction of questions relating to matters of pure discretion in the circuit court, and, therefore, that a certificate on a motion for new trial would not lie, but, where the questions presented went directly to the merits of the case, it had been held that jurisdiction might be entertained.

And, if the sections were repealed so far as defendants were concerned, we think it follows that this was so as to the United States, and that a certificate which could not be granted upon the request of the defendants could not be granted on the request of the prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In U.

S. v. Rider applies, and that the act furnishes the exclusive rule. The appellate jurisdiction was increased in many respects by that act, and was curtailed in others; and, while enlarged in criminal cases in favor of defendants, it was at the same time circumscribed as to the United States by the specific provisions relating to the particular subject, conceding that under the Revised Statutes the remedy by certificate was open, to be availed of by the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certificate dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>164 U.S. 46 (1896)</b></center>\n<center><h1>UNITED STATES<br>\nv.<br>\nHEWECKER.</h1></center>\n<center>No. 547.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Submitted October 13, 1896.</center>\n<center>Decided October 26, 1896.</center>\nCERTIFICATE OF DIVISION IN OPINION FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.\n<p><i>Mr. Abram J.
