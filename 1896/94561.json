The assignments of error in the latter court are that the circuit court erred in finding that the company 'was not entitled to any compensation for the land taken in said proceeding,' in finding that the just compensation to the company 'was not more than one dollar,' in failing to allow it 'any sum as damages sustained by it in the operation of its road and to its property caused by the taking of the land in the petition described,' and that the amount awarded as just compensation was 'grossly inadequate.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of these assignments of error, it is not strange that the supreme court of Illinois made no reference in its opinion to the clause of the constitution of the United States which, in this court for the first time, is invoked to sustain the proposition that the company's property has been taken without due process of law.
