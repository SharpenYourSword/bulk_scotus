Ringo owns an undivided one-half interest of and in said patent with one J. C. Buckner, of Mexico, Mo.: Now be it known that the undersigned, B. Ringo, has this day sold, and does hereby sell and assign, to C. Wade, of Mexico, Mo., all of his said undivided one-half interest in said invention and the letters patent applied for and to be issued to said B. Ringo for and to said Ringo folding bed. And said B. Ringo obligates himself to assign his undivided one-half interest in said letters patent to said C. Wade as soon as the same are issued by and at the patent office of the United States, in such manner as any additional assignment of the same may be necessary other than this writing to convey to said C.

Wade my undivided one-half interest in all patterns, and all of said Ringo folding beds completed or being constructed at J. H. Heitland's, in Quincy, Illinois. For and in consideration of the sale and transfer of the above undivided one-half interest in said invention and letters patent, said C. Wade does hereby sell, transfer, and deliver to said B. Ringo his entire stock of furniture, coffins, fixtures, one furniture wagon, two hearses, and three sets of harness with said wagon and hearses; said stock of furniture being the same now in the building occupied by said C. Wade, on Jefferson street, in Mexico, Mo., which stock of furniture, fixtures, coffins, wagon, and harness, &amp;c., is this day delivered by said C. Wade to said B. Ringo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Said B.

Any other grounds of complaint indicated are unimportant. It was averred that the bed was worthless, and in a replication plaintiff alleged 'that the patent, as set out in defendant's answer as having been issued to C. Wade and J. C. Buckner, at the instance of said Ringo, is void, for the reason that the said patent so issued has neither novelty of invention nor utility of purpose.'

In these conclustions the supreme court of the state concurred. 122 Mo. 322, 25 S.

The controversy was in respect to the rescission of a contract for the exchange of an invention for a stock of merchandise. The decree rested on grounds broad enough to sustain it without reference to any federal question. Application for letters patent was pending when the contract was entered into, and letters patent were issued, so that Wade obtained a half interest therein, as provided.
