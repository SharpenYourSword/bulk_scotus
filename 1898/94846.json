Neither the e tition, containing, as it did, only the allegations usual in an action of ejectment, nor the answer, first filed, raised any question which, however disposed of in the circuit court, would have enabled either party to have brought the case directly to this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, however, the defendants filed an amended answer, in which they averred that the title to the land in dispute was still in the United States; that the Indian title to said land had not been extinguished at the time of the inception of plaintiff's title; that any patent or purported patent granted by the United States while the Indian title was still existing was null and void. After, on motion of the plaintiff, certain portions of these answers had been stricken out, the defendants filed a second amended answer, the main allegations of which were as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the Indian title to the lands in dispute had not been extinguished when Increase Claflin and Daniel Darnell made their entry; that the Indian title was conveyed to the United States under and by virtue of several treaties with the Menominee Indians, to wit, the treaty of February 8, 1831, of February 17, 1831, of October 27, 1882, of October 18, 1848; that by reason of the aforesaid treaties the lands were not subject to entry under the laws of the United States, and that, therefore, the entry of Claflin and Darnell was null and void; that said lands were first offered for sale by the proclamation of the president on May 6, 1835; that the patent of the United States dated September 1, 1838, to Alexander J. Irwin, assignee of Increase Claflin and Daniel Darnell, was and is null and void; that the patent of the United States dated April 16, 1838, to Albert G.

Mere allegations to that effect, not based upon the facts of the case, do not create a case which we are authorized to review.
