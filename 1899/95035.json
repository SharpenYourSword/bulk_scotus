But the liability of the defendant company was held to be secondary to that of Schardt's estate, which was in course of administration, and the amount for which it could be held finally liable on execution was left to be ascertained by a master commissioner, who was directed to take into account 'all collections realized on assets or collaterals turned over to the bank by Schardt to reimburse it against his shortage,' or which the bank 'with due diligence may collect hereafter'; and the case was retained for the purpose of fixing the amount of this ultimate liability to make good Schardt's shortage, 'whatever that may be.' In effect, the circuit court only determined that none of the defenses were good in law, and that the Guarantee Company was liable on its bonds for such sum as might thereafter be found to be due after crediting the amounts that might be realized from the assets turned over to the plaintiff bank by Schardt. Notwithstanding the company's defenses were adjudged to be bad in law, it remained for the circuit court by proper orders to accomplish the object of the suit, namely, to ascertain the amount for which the plaintiff was entitled to judgment and execution. When that amount is judicially ascertained and fixed by a final decree, the adjudication of the cause will be completed for all the purposes of an appeal; and, if the decree be affirmed, the circuit court will then have nothing to do but to carry it into execution.

The Circuit Court disallowed all of the defences made by the Guarantee Company and adjudged that upon the showing made that company was primarily liable to the extent of the penalty of each bond, with interest. But the liability of the defendant company was held to be secondary to that of Schardt's estate which was in course of administration, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*586</span> the amount for which it could be held finally liable on execution was left to be ascertained by a master commissioner who was directed to take into account \"all collections realized on assets or collaterals turned over to the bank by Schardt to reimburse it against his shortage,\" or which the bank \"with due diligence may collect hereafter;\" and the case was retained for the purpose of fixing the amount of this ultimate liability to make good Schardt's shortage, \"whatever that may be.\" In effect, the Circuit Court only determined that none of the defences were good in law, and that the Guarantee Company was liable on its bonds for such sum as might thereafter be found to be due after crediting the amounts that might be realized from the assets turned over to the plaintiff bank by Schardt. Notwithstanding the company's defences were adjudged to be bad in law, it remained for the Circuit Court by proper orders to accomplish the object of the suit, namely, to ascertain the amount for which the plaintiff was entitled to judgment and execution. When that amount is judicially ascertained and fixed by a final decree, the adjudication of the cause will be completed for all the purposes of an appeal; and if the decree be affirmed the Circuit Court will then have nothing to do but to carry it into execution. <i>Railroad Co.</i> v. <i>Swasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"89120\"><a href=\"/opinion/89120/railroad-co-v-swasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span>, 409; <i>Green</i> v. <i>Fisk,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90354\"><a href=\"/opinion/90354/green-v-fisk/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span>, 519; <i>Dainese</i> v. <i>Kendall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91729\"><a href=\"/opinion/91729/dainese-v-kendall/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 54; <i>Lodge</i> v. <i>Twell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92775\"><a href=\"/opinion/92775/lodge-v-twell/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span>, 235.</p>\n<p><i>The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed for want of jurisdiction in the former court, and the cause is remanded with directions to dismiss the appeal prosecuted to that court, and for such further proceedings in the Circuit Court as may be consistent with law.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 95035, "judges": "Harlan", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/95035/", "sha1": "5187b60ff23b76297ce84215bfed671914b23627", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:38:05"}
