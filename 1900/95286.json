Ward, collector of internal revenue for the fourteenth district of New York, from George T. Murdock, executor of the last will of Mrs. Jane H. Sherman, the mother of complainant, as a duty or tax imposed by virtue of the provision of the act of June 13, 1898; that said sum of $8,969.02 was deducted by the said executor from the income due and payable under the provisions of said will to the complainant; that the income, of which the complainant was entitled to receive an annual portion during his life, was composed in part of United States bonds, which the complainant avers to be, by virtue of the acts of Congress under which they were issued, nontaxable and nonassessable for the purposes of taxation.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States, appearing by Charles H. Brown, United States attorney for the northern district of New York, demurred to the complaint upon the ground that the same did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. On hearing the circuit court sustained the demurrer, and ordered that the complin t be dismissed. A writ of error was allowed to this judgment, and the cause was brought to this court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Messrs. Charles E. Patterson, Alpheus T. Bulkeley, Charles F.

Sherman is void because it is an unapportioned direct tax, or, if not a direct tax, but a duty or excise, the same is void because not uniform throughout the United States, or void because it is not competent to levy an inheritance or legacy tax upon property passing to legatees under the laws of the state of New York, they have been disposed of adversely to the plaintiff, in the case of <i>Knowlton</i> v. <i>Moore</i>, recently decided by this court (178 U.

As we have reversed the judgment in the case of <i>Murdock</i> v. <i>Ward</i>, and have remanded that case to the circuit court of the southern district of New York, in order that the erroneous computation may be corrected, and as thus what is coming to the plaintiff in error, upon such correction being made, will be recovered by Murdock as executor and trustee under the will of Mrs. Sherman, and thereby and in that case the plaintiff in error will be indemnified, he needs no further proceeding in his suit in the circuit court for the northern district of New York.
