The bills of lading (as appears by the copy annexed to the answer) state that the lumber had been shipped by the respondents, and was to be delivered 'unto order or to their assigns, they paying freight for the said lumber as per charter party dated 7th March, 1893, and average accustomed.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third.

Charterers' responsibility to cease when vessel is loaded and bills of lading are signed.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the vessel had been loaded, bills of lading were duly signed by the master, by the terms of which the cargo was to be delivered to the charterers or their assigns, 'they paying freight as per charter party,' 'and average accustomed,'&#8212;referring to the charter by its date, but not mentioning demurrage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first question to be considered is how far the claim of the shipowners against the charterers for demurrage is affected by what is commonly called the cesser clause in the charter party, 'Charterers' responsibility to cease when vessel is loaded and bills of lading are signed.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circuit court of appeals, approving and adopting in this particular the opinion of the district judge, held that the cesser clause afforded no defense to the libel; and we have no doubt of the correctness of that conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The charter party, like many mercantile instruments in common use, is drawn up in brief and disjointed sentences, and must be construed according to the intent of the parties as manifested by the whole instrument, rather than by the literal meaning of any particular clause taken by itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question here is how the clause providing that the charterers' responsibility shall cease when the vessel is loaded and bills of lading are signed is to be reconciled with the other provisions of the charter, which not only require the charterers to pay freight on delivery of the cargo, and demurrage for any delay in such delivery by fault of the charterers or their agent, but declare that the vessel is to have an absolute lien upon the cargo for both freight and demurrage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The true rule of construction of the cesser clause, in such a connection, has been settled by a series of English decisions in which that excellent commercial lawyer, Lord Esher, lately master of the rolls, took a leading part; and is well summed up, with the reasons supporting it, by himself and other judges, in two recent cases in the court of appeal. <i>Clink</i> v. <i>Radford</i> [1891] 1 Q. B. 625; <i>Hansen</i> v. <i>Harrold</i> [1894] 1 Q. B. 612.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Clink</i> v. <i>Radford</i> Lord Esher said: 'In my opinion, the main rule to be derived from the cases as to the interpretation of the cesser clause in a charter party is that the court will construe it as inapplicable to the particular breach complained of, if by construing it otherwise the shipowner would be left unprotected in respect of that particular breach, unless the cesser clause is expressed in terms that prohibit such a conclusion. In other words, it cannot be assumed that the shipowner, without any mercantile reason, would give up by the cesser clause rights which he had stipulated for in another part of the contract.' Lord Justice Bowen said: 'There is no doubt that the parties may, if they choose, so frame the clause as to emancipate the charterer from any specified liability, without providing for any terms of compensation to the shipowner; but such a contract would not be one we should expect to see in a commercial transaction. The cesser clauses, as they generally come before the courts, are clauses which couple or link the provisions for the cesser of the charterer's liability with a corresponding creation of a lien. There is a principle of reason which is obvious to commercial minds, and which should be borne in mind in considering a cesser clause so framed, namely, that reasonable persons would regard the lien given as an equivalent for the release of responsibility, which the cesser clause in its earlier part creates, and one would expect to find the lien commensurate with the release of liability.' And Lord Justice Fry added: 'The rule that we are prima facie to apply to the construction of a cesser clause followed by a lien clause appears to me to be well ascertained. That rule seems a most rational one, and it is simply this, that the two are to be read, if possible, as coextensive. If that were not so, we should have this extraordinary result: there would be a clause in the charter party the breach of which would create a legal liability; there would then be a cesser clause destroying that liability; and there would then come a lien clause which did not recreate that liability in anybody else.' [1891] 1 Q. B. 627, 620, 632.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Hansen</i> v. <i>Harrold</i> Lord Esher said that he thought that <i>Clink</i> v. <i>Radford</i> 'was a right decision based upon sound mercantile reasons;' and, after quoting the passages above cited from the opinions in that case, added: 'It seems to me that this reasoning has not been and cannot be answered. Therefore the proposition is true, that where the provision for cesser of liability is accompanied by the stipulation as to lien, then the cesser of liability is not to apply in so far as the lien, which by the charter party the charterers are able to create, is not equivalent to the liability of the charterers. Where, in such a case, the provisions of the charter party enable the charterers to make such terms with the shippers that the lien which is created is not commensurate with the liability of the charterers under the charter party, then the cesser clause will only apply so far as the lien which can be exercised by the shipowner is commensurate with such liability.' [1894] 1 Q. B. 617, 618.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, in a charter party which contains a clause for cesser of the liability of the charterers, coupled with a clause creating a lien in favor of the shipowner, the cesser clause is to be construed, if possible, as inapplicable to a liability with which the lien is not commensurate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at bar, the provision of the charter party, which requires 'the bills of lading to be signed as presented, without prejudice to this charter,' while it obliged the master to sign bills of lading upon request of the charterers, does not mean that the bills of lading, or the consignee holding them, shall be subject to all the provisions of the charter, but only that the obligations of the charterers to the ship and her owners are not to be affected by the bills of lading so signed. <i>Gledstanes</i> v. <i>Allen</i> (1852) 12 C. B. 202. The bills of lading, as already mentioned, provide only for 'paying freight for said lumber as per charter party dated 7th March, 1893, and average accustomed.' They do not mention demurrage, or refer to any provisions of the charter, other than those concerning freight and average. It is well settled that a bill of lading in such a form does not subject an indorsee thereof, who receives the goods under it, to any of those other provisions of the charter. It does not give him notice of, or render him liable to, the specific provisions of the charter, which require a discharge of a certain quantity of lumber per day, or, in default thereof, the payment of a specific sum for a longer detention of the vessel; but he is entitled to take the goods within a reasonable time after arrival, and is liable to pay damages for undue delay in taking them, according to the ordinary rules of law which govern in the absence of specific agreement. <i>Chappel</i> v. <i>Comfort</i> (1861) 10 C. B. N. S. 802; <i>Gray</i> v. <i>Carr</i> (1871) L. R. 6 Q. B. 522; <i>Porteus</i> v. <i>Watney</i> (1878) L. R. 3 Q. B. Div. 534, 537; <i>Serraino</i> v. <i>Campbell</i> [1891] 1 Q. B. 283; <i>Dayton</i> v. <i>Parke</i> (1894) 142 N. Y. 391, 37 N.

App. Cas. 128, on which the charterers relied at the argument in this court, the sole ground on which the indorsees of the bills of lading were held to be bound by the provisions of the charter party was that they were the persons who had originally authorized the chartering of the ship. See L. R. 2 H. L. Sc. App. Cas. 133, 134, 136; s. c. L. R. 6 Q. B. 559, 560. No such fact was pleaded in the case at bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only facts stated in the answer upon this point are that, after the vessel was fully laden, and long before the notice to the charterers that she was ready to discharge, bills of lading acknowledging that the lumber had been shipped by the respondents, and was to be delivered to their order or assigns, 'they paying freight for the said lumber as per charter party,' were signed by the master of the vessel, and 'were duly assigned and delivered to the Companhia Industrial do Brazil, and by them assigned and delivered to' the partnership of da Cruz &amp; Filho, 'who thereby became consignees of the cargo.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon this state of facts, the rights of the shipowners against those consignees depended altogether on the contract created by the bills of lading, except so far as that contract referred to the charter party. <i>Bags of Linseed</i> (1861) 1 Black, 108, <i>sub nom. Sears</i> v. <i>Wills</i>, 17 L. ed. 35. As observed by Mr. Justice Peckham, when delivering a judgment of the court of appeals of the state of New York, in regard to a bill of lading containing a clause exactly like that in the bills of lading in the case at bar: 'It would be a wide stretch to hold that by this language of the bill of lading, which plainly referred only to the provisions of the charter party as to the freight money, a consignee would become liable to demurrage if he accepted the cargo under such a bill.' <i>Dayton</i> v. <i>Parke</i>, 142 N. Y. 391, 400, 37 N. E. 642.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The necessary consequence is that the responsibility of the charterers to the shipowners for demurrage according to the charter party is not affected by the cesser clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other principal question is of the validity of the defense that the delay in discharging the cargo was caused by the acts of the public enemy, and not by any default of the charterers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon this question the courts below differed in opinion, the district court holding that the defense pleaded was a good one, and the circuit court of appeals holding that it was not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This defense, as set up in the amended answer filed in the circuit court of appeals, is that, when the vessel arrived at Rio Janeiro, the owners of the cargo used all reasonable diligence in and about receiving and removing it; that the shipowners were prevented from discharging the cargo, and the respondents were prevented from receiving it, any sooner than they did, 'by reason of the acts of the public enemy, to wit, certain vessels of war which were then in the harbor of Rio Janeiro, and were engaged in firing upon the forts in said harbor, and making war upon the government of Brazil; and that the firing between said vessels of war and the said forts made it impossible to discharge the said cargo or to receive it from the said vessel, any sooner than it was discharged or received; that the said cargo was delivered according to the custom of said port of Rio Janeiro, and that the detention alleged in the libel, if any such there be, was caused by said acts of the public enemy, and not by any default of the respondents.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are of opinion that, under a charter party expressed in such terms, the defense of <i>vis major</i>, as thus pleaded, affords a complete answer to the claim for demurrage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is to be remembered that by the terms of this charter party it is only for 'detention by default of' the charterers or their agent that they agree to pay the amount of demurrage specified in the charter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A detention which is caused, not by any act of the shipowners or of the charterers, but wholly by the actual firing of guns from an enemy's ships of war upon the forts in the harbor, directly affecting the vessel and making the discharge of the cargo dangerous and impossible, cannot be considered as caused by 'default' of the charterers, in any just sense of the word.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Towle</i> v. <i>Kettell</i> (1849) 5 Cush. 18, the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts, in an opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Fletcher, with the concurrence of Chief Justice Shaw and Justices Wilde and Dewey, held that, under a similar provision in a charter party, the charterers were not liable for demurrage while the vessel was detained in quarantine by order of a foreign government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circuit court of appeals, in support of the opposite conclusion, quoted from an opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Clifford, in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts, the following passage: 'The settled rule is, where the contract of affreightment expressly stipulates that a given number of days shall be allowed for the discharge of the cargo, such a limitation is an express stipulation that the vessel shall in no event be detained longer for that purpose, and that if so detained it shall be considered as the delay of the freighter, even where it was not occasioned by his fault, but was inevitable. . . . Where the contract is that the ship shall be unladen within a certain number of days, it is no defense to an action for demurrage that the overdelay was occasioned by the crowded state of the docks, or by port regulations or government restraints.' <i>Davis</i> v. <i>Wallace</i> (1868) 3 Cliff. 123, 131, Fed.

But in none of the suthorities cited, either by the learned justice in that case, or by the circuit court of appeals in this, in support of this general statement, was the liability of the charterers for demurrage restricted to the case of their default.

S. App. 369, 61 Fed. Rep. 849, 10 C. C. A. 115, in the circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit, upon which these libellants much rely, falls far short of supporting their claim. In that case the clause in question was in the same words as in this case; the charterers sent the vessel, for the purpose of loading a cargo of nitrate of soda which they had purchased, to a port in Chili, during the existence of a civil war there, and while the port was in the possession of the insurgents; the sellers declined for a time to deliver the cargo, because they feared that if the export duty, which by the law of Chili was payable upon all such cargoes, was paid by them to the insurgents, they might remain liable for it to the rightful government. It was held that the charterers were liable for the stipulated demurrage during the delay so occasioned. The court, speaking of the word 'default' in the charter, said: 'The most that can be claimed for its effect is that it excludes liability of the charterers for delay in loading or discharging, if the delay result from a sudden or unforeseen interruption or prevention of the act itself of loading or discharging, not occurring through the connivance or fault of the charterers.' 'But there was no interference upon the part of the Chilian government, or upon the part of any armed force, to prevent their obtaining possession of the cargo, or handling or moving the same, or placing it within reach of the vessel's tackle.' 15 U. S. App. 374, 376, 61 Fed. Rep. 851, 853, 10 C. C.

The decree of the district court, which dismissed the libel, must also be reversed, and the case remanded to the district court, in order that both parties may have an opportunity to introduce proofs upon the issue presented by that article.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the brief of the libellants in this court, it is suggested that the allegations of that article of the answer were not in fact true; and reference is made to the master's deposition, taken after the delivery of the principal opinion in the circuit court of appeals, in which he testified that during all the time that the vessel lay at the wharf, and until the completion of the discharge, there was no firing in the harbor, or other act of hostilities, which prevented her discharge of the cargo or its reception by the consignees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But on the same page of the brief it is admitted that 'this question having been heard on the exception to the sufficiency of the defense, the question as to the truth of the allegations of the answer was not before the court.' And this is conclusively established by its opinions and decrees. The principal opinion shows that it took up, in the first instance, the questions of law raised by the exceptions to the answer, because their determination might relieve the parties from the delay and expense of introducing proof. 35 U. S. App. 620, 69 Fed. Rep. 747, 16 C. C. A. 381. By the decree thereupon made and set out in the record, the third exception, as well as the second, was sustained upon the ground that the article of the answer to which it related was 'insufficient in the law to constitute a defense;' and the fourth exception was overruled. In short, the defenses of the cesser clause and of <i>vis major</i> were both held to be insufficient as matter of law, so that no evidence in support of either of them was competent, and no evidence to contradict either was necessary or material.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only questions of fact left open for the introduction of proofs were those of payment, and of accord and satisfaction, presented by the remaining article of the answer. That the circuit court of appeals understood such to be the condition of the case is apparent from its supplemental opinion, after proofs had been taken, in which it observed that 'most of the questions arising upon this appeal have been disposed of by this court upon a former occasion (35 U. S. App. 608, 69 Fed. Rep. 747, 16 C.C. A. 381), and it remains to be considered whether the defenses of payment and accord and satisfaction are sustained by the proofs;' and then proceeded, upon an examination of the proofs, to hold that those defenses were not sustained as to the claim for demurrage, and to enter a decree for the libellants in accordance with its former opinion. 62 U.

B. 625; <i>Hansen</i> v. <i>Harrold</i> [1894] 1 Q. B. 612.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Clink</i> v. <i>Radford</i> Lord Esher said: 'In my opinion, the main rule to be derived from the cases as to the interpretation of the cesser clause in a charter party is that the court will construe it as inapplicable to the particular breach complained of, if by construing it otherwise the shipowner would be left unprotected in respect of that particular breach, unless the cesser clause is expressed in terms that prohibit such a conclusion. In other words, it cannot be assumed that the shipowner, without any mercantile reason, would give up by the cesser clause rights which he had stipulated for in another part of the contract.' Lord Justice Bowen said: 'There is no doubt that the parties may, if they choose, so frame the clause as to emancipate the charterer from any specified liability, without providing for any terms of compensation to the shipowner; but such a contract would not be one we should expect to see in a commercial transaction. The cesser clauses, as they generally come before the courts, are clauses which couple or link the provisions for the cesser of the charterer's liability with a corresponding creation of a lien. There is a principle of reason which is obvious to commercial minds, and which should be borne in mind in considering a cesser clause so framed, namely, that reasonable persons would regard the lien given as an equivalent for the release of responsibility, which the cesser clause in its earlier part creates, and one would expect to find the lien commensurate with the release of liability.' And Lord Justice Fry added: 'The rule that we are prima facie to apply to the construction of a cesser clause followed by a lien clause appears to me to be well ascertained. That rule seems a most rational one, and it is simply this, that the two are to be read, if possible, as coextensive. If that were not so, we should have this extraordinary result: there would be a clause in the charter party the breach of which would create a legal liability; there would then be a cesser clause destroying that liability; and there would then come a lien clause which did not recreate that liability in anybody else.' [1891] 1 Q. B. 627, 620, 632.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Hansen</i> v. <i>Harrold</i> Lord Esher said that he thought that <i>Clink</i> v. <i>Radford</i> 'was a right decision based upon sound mercantile reasons;' and, after quoting the passages above cited from the opinions in that case, added: 'It seems to me that this reasoning has not been and cannot be answered. Therefore the proposition is true, that where the provision for cesser of liability is accompanied by the stipulation as to lien, then the cesser of liability is not to apply in so far as the lien, which by the charter party the charterers are able to create, is not equivalent to the liability of the charterers. Where, in such a case, the provisions of the charter party enable the charterers to make such terms with the shippers that the lien which is created is not commensurate with the liability of the charterers under the charter party, then the cesser clause will only apply so far as the lien which can be exercised by the shipowner is commensurate with such liability.' [1894] 1 Q.

B. 202. The bills of lading, as already mentioned, provide only for 'paying freight for said lumber as per charter party dated 7th March, 1893, and average accustomed.' They do not mention demurrage, or refer to any provisions of the charter, other than those concerning freight and average. It is well settled that a bill of lading in such a form does not subject an indorsee thereof, who receives the goods under it, to any of those other provisions of the charter. It does not give him notice of, or render him liable to, the specific provisions of the charter, which require a discharge of a certain quantity of lumber per day, or, in default thereof, the payment of a specific sum for a longer detention of the vessel; but he is entitled to take the goods within a reasonable time after arrival, and is liable to pay damages for undue delay in taking them, according to the ordinary rules of law which govern in the absence of specific agreement. <i>Chappel</i> v. <i>Comfort</i> (1861) 10 C.

App. Cas. 128, on which the charterers relied at the argument in this court, the sole ground on which the indorsees of the bills of lading were held to be bound by the provisions of the charter party was that they were the persons who had originally authorized the chartering of the ship. See L. R. 2 H. L. Sc. App. Cas. 133, 134, 136; s. c. L. R. 6 Q. B. 559, 560.

As observed by Mr. Justice Peckham, when delivering a judgment of the court of appeals of the state of New York, in regard to a bill of lading containing a clause exactly like that in the bills of lading in the case at bar: 'It would be a wide stretch to hold that by this language of the bill of lading, which plainly referred only to the provisions of the charter party as to the freight money, a consignee would become liable to demurrage if he accepted the cargo under such a bill.' <i>Dayton</i> v. <i>Parke</i>, 142 N.

Where the contract is that the ship shall be unladen within a certain number of days, it is no defense to an action for demurrage that the overdelay was occasioned by the crowded state of the docks, or by port regulations or government restraints.' <i>Davis</i> v. <i>Wallace</i> (1868) 3 Cliff. 123, 131, Fed. Cas. No. 3,657. But in none of the suthorities cited, either by the learned justice in that case, or by the circuit court of appeals in this, in support of this general statement, was the liability of the charterers for demurrage restricted to the case of their default. In <i>Davis</i> v. <i>Wallace</i>, indeed, their liability was so restricted; but the defense was a crowded state of the docks, and no question of port regulations or government restraints was before the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Thacher</i> v. <i>Boston Gaslight Co.</i> (1874) 2 Low.

And he distinctly recognized that a failure of contract on the part of the charterer, 'caused by a direct and immediate <i>vis major</i>, or something like it,' would not be a 'default' within the meaning of the charter party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Davis</i> v. <i>Pendergast</i> (1879) 16 Blatchf. 565, 567, Fed.

S. App. 369, 61 Fed. Rep. 849, 10 C. C. A. 115, in the circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit, upon which these libellants much rely, falls far short of supporting their claim. In that case the clause in question was in the same words as in this case; the charterers sent the vessel, for the purpose of loading a cargo of nitrate of soda which they had purchased, to a port in Chili, during the existence of a civil war there, and while the port was in the possession of the insurgents; the sellers declined for a time to deliver the cargo, because they feared that if the export duty, which by the law of Chili was payable upon all such cargoes, was paid by them to the insurgents, they might remain liable for it to the rightful government. It was held that the charterers were liable for the stipulated demurrage during the delay so occasioned. The court, speaking of the word 'default' in the charter, said: 'The most that can be claimed for its effect is that it excludes liability of the charterers for delay in loading or discharging, if the delay result from a sudden or unforeseen interruption or prevention of the act itself of loading or discharging, not occurring through the connivance or fault of the charterers.' 'But there was no interference upon the part of the Chilian government, or upon the part of any armed force, to prevent their obtaining possession of the cargo, or handling or moving the same, or placing it within reach of the vessel's tackle.' 15 U. S. App. 374, 376, 61 Fed. Rep. 851, 853, 10 C. C.

The decree of the district court, which dismissed the libel, must also be reversed, and the case remanded to the district court, in order that both parties may have an opportunity to introduce proofs upon the issue presented by that article.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the brief of the libellants in this court, it is suggested that the allegations of that article of the answer were not in fact true; and reference is made to the master's deposition, taken after the delivery of the principal opinion in the circuit court of appeals, in which he testified that during all the time that the vessel lay at the wharf, and until the completion of the discharge, there was no firing in the harbor, or other act of hostilities, which prevented her discharge of the cargo or its reception by the consignees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But on the same page of the brief it is admitted that 'this question having been heard on the exception to the sufficiency of the defense, the question as to the truth of the allegations of the answer was not before the court.' And this is conclusively established by its opinions and decrees. The principal opinion shows that it took up, in the first instance, the questions of law raised by the exceptions to the answer, because their determination might relieve the parties from the delay and expense of introducing proof. 35 U. S. App. 620, 69 Fed. Rep. 747, 16 C. C. A. 381. By the decree thereupon made and set out in the record, the third exception, as well as the second, was sustained upon the ground that the article of the answer to which it related was 'insufficient in the law to constitute a defense;' and the fourth exception was overruled. In short, the defenses of the cesser clause and of <i>vis major</i> were both held to be insufficient as matter of law, so that no evidence in support of either of them was competent, and no evidence to contradict either was necessary or material.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only questions of fact left open for the introduction of proofs were those of payment, and of accord and satisfaction, presented by the remaining article of the answer. That the circuit court of appeals understood such to be the condition of the case is apparent from its supplemental opinion, after proofs had been taken, in which it observed that 'most of the questions arising upon this appeal have been disposed of by this court upon a former occasion (35 U. S. App. 608, 69 Fed. Rep. 747, 16 C.C. A. 381), and it remains to be considered whether the defenses of payment and accord and satisfaction are sustained by the proofs;' and then proceeded, upon an examination of the proofs, to hold that those defenses were not sustained as to the claim for demurrage, and to enter a decree for the libellants in accordance with its former opinion. 62 U.
