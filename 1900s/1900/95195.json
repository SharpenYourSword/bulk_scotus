Plaintiff appealed to the circuit court, which also sustained the demurrer and dismissed the petition. Whereupon plaintiff appealed the case to the supreme court of the state, which affirmed the judgment of the dircuit court, whereupon plaintiff sued out writ of error from this court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Messrs.
