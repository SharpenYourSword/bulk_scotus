Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Phinney</i>, just decided, 178 U. S. 327, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 906, 44 L. ed. &#8212;&#8212;, is an action on an insurance policy issued by the company, the premiums on which were unpaid for years before the death of the insured. The facts, as disclosed by the pleadings (and the case went off on the pleadings, without any testimony), are that on May 18, 1891, the insurance company issued a policy to Stephen P. Sears, he being the beneficiary named in the policy, as well as the insured. He paid the first annual premium and received the policy, but neglected to pay the premium due on May 18, 1892, and all subsequent premiums. He lived until March 30, 1898, and thereafter his widow, the plaintiff below, was appointed his executrix. The answer alleged nonpayment of the premiums from 1892 onward, and also 'that subsequent to the failure of the said Stephen P. Sears to make payment of the said annual premium falling due on said policy May 18, 1893, and subsequent to the lapsing of said policy for failure to make said payment, and after the said Stephen P. Sears was fully informed and knew that said policy had been by it declared lapsed and void for nonpayment of premium, tis  defendant, through its agents, applied to said Stephen P. Sears to make restoration of said policy by making payment of said defaulted premium and having the said policy restored to force, but that said Stephen P. Sears refused to make such payment, and refused longer to continue said policy or make any further payments thereon, and then and there elected to have the same terminated, and this defendant, relying upon the said election and determination of said Stephen P. Sears, at all times subsequent thereto treated said policy as lapsed, abandoned, and terminated, and relying upon the said conduct of said Sears abstained from taking any further action or step in relation to said policy, by way of notice or otherwise, in order to effect the cancelation and termination thereof.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A demurrer to this answer was sustained, and judgment entered for the plaintiff, which was affirmed by the court of appeals (97 Fed. Rep. 986, 38 C. C. A. 696), and the case was thereupon brought to this court on certiorari.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Messrs. Julien T. Davies, John B. Allen, Edward Lyman Short, Frederic D.
