Upon that judgment a writ of attachment was issued and served May 24 and 25, 1898, upon the Chestnut Street National Bank of Philadelphia and upon Earle, receiver, as garnishees,&#8212;the receiver having been appointed January 29, 1898,&#8212;commanding them to show cause on a day named why the judgment against Schall, with costs of writ, should not be levied of his effects in their hands.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bank and the receiver entered their appearance as defendants and garnishees 'for the purpose only of moving said court to set aside the writ of summons in attachment sur judgment against him and them, and to dismiss and vacate all proceedings in attachment therein against him or them.'
