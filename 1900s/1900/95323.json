Both parties were citizens of Ohio and residents of that district. The District Court dismissed the bill, for want of jurisdiction. 94 Fed. Rep. 625. The plaintiff appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which certified to this court the following question:</p>\n<p>\"Has a District Court of the United States jurisdiction to entertain a bill in equity filed by a trustee in bankruptcy, appointed by it, against a fraudulent grantee or transferee of the bankrupt resident in its district, to recover the property belonging <span class=\"star-pagination\">*542</span> to the estate of the bankrupt, and by him fraudulently conveyed to defendant?\"</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated in <i>Bardes</i> v. <i>Hawarden Bank,</i> just decided, the answer to this question must be that the District Court has such jurisdiction by the consent of the proposed defendant, but not otherwise.</p>\n<p><i>Ordered accordingly.</i></p>\n</div>",
