In promulgating the rules referred to, this court expressed its deliberate judgment as to the proper mode of proceeding on the part of ship owners for the purpose of having their rights under the act declared and settled by the definitive decree of a competent court, which should be binding on all parties interested, and protect the ship owners from being harassed by litigation in other tribunals. . . . We see no reason to modify these views, and, in our judgment, the proper District Court, designated by the rules, or otherwise indicated by circumstances, has full jurisdiction and plenary power, as a court of admiralty, to entertain and carry on all proper proceedings for the due execution of the law, in all its parts.\"</p>\n<p>Clearly then these were admiralty cases; the decrees of the Circuit Court of Appeals were made final by the statute; and the appeals must be</p>\n<p><i>Dismissed.</i></p>\n</div>",
