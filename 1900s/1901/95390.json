A joint plea was filed by the defendants setting up a claim to exemption under the charter of the former Louisville Company, which for twenty-five years from March 3, 1882, appropriated all taxes to its construction debts, with a proviso that this appropriation should cease when the profits were sufficient to enable it to declare and pay an annual dividend of 8 per cent upon the capital stock, over and above the payment of its debts and liabilities. But this plea did not allege that the railroad was built under this charter, nor that the profits had not been sufficient to pay the dividends; and a demurrer was interposed for these reasons, which was sustained by the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants then, under leave to answer over, filed two pleas, of which the first, called the amended or second plea, rectified the two foregoing omissions, and set up that this exemption was an irrepealable contract of appropriation of the taxes, and protected by the contract clause of the 14th Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third plea set up the record and decision in <i>Natchez, J. &amp; C.

Valley R. Co.</i> was violative of the contract clause. Then followed a maze of replications, rejoinders, and demurrers, into which it would be wholly unprofitable to enter. Suffice it to say that from this 'labyrinth of special pleadings,' as it was termed by the supreme court (77 Miss. 780), three questions were evolved:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First.
