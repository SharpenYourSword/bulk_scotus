The rental of the hydrants was fixed, as to some of them at $62.50 per annum, and others at $50 and $40 per annum. In the ordinance fixing the latter sums it was provided that nothing therein should 'operate to affect in any way any of the provisions of the ordinance heretofore passed by said city relative to the Danville Water Company, except to the extent of the reduction of the rental of the additional hydrants therein provided and hydrants thereafter to be provided.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was an allegation that plaintiff did all things required of it in the construction of the system, and put in all mains and hydrants and kept them supplied with water.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pleas of the defendant admitted that the sum of $1,930 was due, but denied liability for anything over that sum, because the rental for the hydrants had been reduced by an ordinance passed by the city January 17, 1895, which was entitled 'An Ordinance Prescribing the Maximum Rates and Charges for the Supply of Water Furnished by the Danville Water Company of the City of Danville.' The ordinance recited that after a careful comparison of water rates and charges in other cities it was found that those of the Danville company were 'unjust, excessive, and unreasonable.' And that whereas under the act of the state approved June 6, 1891, in force July 1, 1891, and under 'other fully competent and complete legal authority,' the city was empowered to prescribe the ordinance maximum rates for water furnished by the Danville company; and whereas, after full investigation the members of the council believed the rates prescribed were just and reasonable, a schedule or scale of rates was ordained to take effect on the 1st of May, 1895. The rental of fire hydrants was reduced for the first 140 to a uniform rate of $50 per annum; for all others then rented and others which should be rented, $40 per annum. For certain uses of water which had been theretofore furnished free by the plaintiff a rate was fixed, to be paid by the city. Provision was made for the appearance by the city attorney if the plaintiff should desire to apply to the circuit court of the county for a review of the rates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was an allegation of notice of the passage of the ordinance to the plaintiff, and the prior ordinance under which plaintiff claimed an irrevocable contract were at the time of the passage of said ordinances in excess of a reasonable compensation for the water supplied, and were at the time of suit 'unjust, unreasonable, and excessive.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff demurred to each of the defendant's pleas, and the demurrer was sustained.

In the ordinance fixing the latter sums it was provided that nothing therein should \"operate to affect in any way any of the provisions of the ordinance heretofore passed by said city relative to the Danville Water Company except to the extent of the reduction of the rental of the additional hydrants therein provided and hydrants thereafter to be provided.\"</p>\n<p>There was an allegation that plaintiff did all things required of it in the construction of the system, and put in all mains and hydrants and kept them supplied with water.</p>\n<p>The pleas of the defendant admitted that the sum of $1930 was due, but denied liability for anything over that sum, because the rental for the hydrants had been reduced by an ordinance passed by the city January 17, 1895, which was entitled \"An ordinance prescribing the maximum rates and charges for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*622</span> the supply of water furnished by the Danville Water Company of the city of Danville.\" The ordinance recited that after a careful comparison of water rates and charges in other cities it was found that those of the Danville company were \"unjust, excessive and unreasonable.\" And that whereas under the act of the State approved June 6, 1891, in force July 1, 1891, and under \"other fully competent and complete legal authority,\" the city was empowered to prescribe by ordinance maximum rates for water furnished by the Danville company; and whereas, after full investigation the members of the council believed the rates prescribed were just and reasonable, a schedule or scale of rates was ordained to take effect on the first of May, 1895. The rental of fire hydrants was reduced for the first one hundred and forty to a uniform rate of $50 per annum; for all others then rented and others which should be rented, $40 per annum. For certain uses of water which had been theretofore furnished free by the plaintiff a rate was fixed, to be paid by the city. Provision was made for the appearance by the city attorney if the plaintiff should desire to apply to the circuit court of the county for a review of the rates.</p>\n<p>There was an allegation of notice of the passage of the ordinance to the plaintiff, and the prior ordinances under which plaintiff claimed an irrevocable contract were at the time of the passage of said ordinances in excess of a reasonable compensation for the water supplied, and were at the time of suit \"unjust, unreasonable and excessive.\"</p>\n<p>The plaintiff demurred to each of the defendant's pleas, and the demurrer was sustained. The defendant asked that the demurrer be carried back to the declaration, and elected to stand by its pleas. Judgment was entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $2701, motion to arrest, which was denied, and the case was then taken to the Supreme Court of the State, by which court the judgment was reversed, and the cause was remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the views expressed in the opinion filed in the cause.</p>\n<p>On the return of the case to the circuit court the defendant by leave of the court filed additional pleas, to which a demurrer was sustained. With this action of the court we have no concern.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*623</span> In accordance with the opinion of the Supreme Court of the State the demurrer of the plaintiff was overruled as to the first and second pleas of the defendant, and sustained as to the third. The plaintiff elected to stand by its demurrer, and judgment was entered for the sum of $1930 and all costs of suit. On appeal to the Supreme Court it was sustained, the court expressing the following opinion, (186 Illinois, 326):</p>\n<p>\"This case has practically been before us on two former occasions, the parties then being reversed.</p>\n<p>\"Counsel for appellant concede the judgment from which this appeal is taken is in exact conformity with the judgments and opinions in the former cases, and that no new question or matter has intervened since the former hearings here. Manifestly the only purpose of this appeal is to obtain a final judgment in this court to enable appellant to take a further appeal, if it should desire to do so.</p>\n<p>\"Adhering as we do to the reasoning and conclusions announced in <i>Danville Water Co.</i> v. <i>Danville City,</i> 78 Illinois, 229, and <i>Same</i> v. <i>Same,</i> 180 Illinois, 235, on the authority of these cases this judgment will be affirmed.\"</p>\n<p>The chief justice of the State allowed this writ of error.</p>\n<p>The questions presented by this record are the same passed on in <i>Freeport Water Co.</i> v. <i>Freeport City, ante,</i> 587, and depends upon the same statutes. Upon the authority of that case the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE, with whom concurred MR. JUSTICE BREWER, MR. JUSTICE, BROWN and MR. JUSTICE PECKHAM, dissenting.</p>\n<p>It will be seen from the opinion of the court that this case differs in no material particular from that of the <i>Freeport Water Co.</i> v. <i>Freeport City,</i> just decided. Under the sanction of the same statutes considered in the <i>Freeport</i> case, the defendant in error, the city of Danville, contracted with the plaintiff in error, the water company, for the period authorized by the statute, and stipulated as to the rates to be paid for a public <span class=\"star-pagination\">*624</span> water supply. These rates were adhered to until, under the authority of the statute of the State of Illinois passed in 1891, referred to in the opinion in the <i>Freeport</i> case, the defendant in error reduced the rates below the contract price. It now asserts in this record that it possessed the power to do so.</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated by me for dissenting from the opinion and decree in the <i>Freeport</i> case, I dissent from the opinion and decree in the present case.</p>\n</div>", "id": 95438, "judges": "McKenna", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/95438/", "sha1": "d3b775943ff370effdf8ca073dbde06546e4331f", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:38:14"}
