It thus appears that this judgment was barred, according to the terms of the act, some years before the writ was issued, but it is contended that, although that was so, the bar did not apply to the writ of scire facias, by the use of which the judgment could be revived and an execution issued upon it notwithstanding the lapse of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is argued that scire facias is not included in the words 'all actions,' barred by the statute, because a proceeding by scire facias is not an action, and because to hold it to be would be inconsistent with another statutory provision that actions should be commenced by 'the filing in the proper clerk's office of the petition, declaration, bill, or affidavit.'
