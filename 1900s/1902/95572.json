To this bill defendants interposed a plea setting up the various steps by which the defendant Groeck obtained the patent of the land as a qualified pre-emptor, and thereby, as alleged, obtained a legal and perfect title in fee simple; and further setting up the defense of laches to the claim of the railroad company.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circuit court entered an order sustaining the plea upon the ground of laches, with leave to the company to reply to the plea and take issue as to the matters of fact therein alleged. 74 Fed. 585.
