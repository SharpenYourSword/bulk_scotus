Should the depredation have been committed while the claimant was in the Indian country, he must state whether he was lawfully there, either having a license to trade with the Indians, a passport, or a permit from the proper Indian authorities, or was <i>en route</i> through said country to a place of ultimate destination at some point within the limits of any State or Territory not included within the limits of the reservation for any nation or tribe of Indians set apart by treaty provision, or by executive order; and he in such declaration must further state whether any of the property so stolen or destroyed has subsequently been recovered by or for him, the claimant; and whether the claimant has at any time received part compensation therefor; and if so, how much, when, and from what source; and further, that the claimant has in no way endeavored to obtain private satisfaction or revenge.</p>\n<p>\"Second.
