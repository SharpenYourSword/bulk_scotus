Cl. 347), in the sum of three hundred and ten dollars and thirty-seven cents ($310.37).'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case is in narrow compass. There is no controversy over the fact of expenditure of the sum sued for, and the court of claims found that 'the accounts and itemized vouchers were presented to the accounting officers in the form prescribed by statute; that is to say, that each telegram sent by the Commission, and the cost thereof, and the dates, number of words, persons from and to whom sent, places from and to which sent, and the charge for each message transmitted, were fully shown in a voucher approved by Martin A.

Cl. 347), the court evidently thought that the issue made by the government was not substantial. In that case it was said: 'The claimant's statement of account being in the form prescribed by statute&#8212;<i>i. e.</i>, 'itemized vouchers therefor, approved by the chairman of the Commission,' is prima facie correct. The defendants do not controvert the fact of the expenditures therein shown to have been made under the direction of the Commission, nor of the money paid into the Treasury; and, as under the circumstances of this case we have no reason to doubt the correctness or legality of such expenditures, the claimant is entitled to recover, and judgment will be entered accordingly.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case comes, therefore, to a very narrow question. The Act to Regulate Commerce, as amended March 2, 1889 (Rev. Stat. Supp. 690, chap. 382, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3168), provides 'all of the expenses of the Commission . . . shall be allowed and paid on the presentation of itemized vouchers therefor approved by the chairman of the Commission.' The appropriation act of the same date (Rev. Stat. Supp. 698, chap. 411) provides: 'That hereafter expenses of the Interstate Commerce Commission shall be audited by the proper accounting officers of the Treasury.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is claimed that these provisions can be reconciled and leave unimpaired the first as the only condition of the allowance and payment of the expenses of the Commission. Not passing upon that, but granting the power of the auditing officers to require something more, we think their requirement was substantially complied with.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is to be remembered that the petitioner (appellee) is but the secretary of the Commission. He does not direct its functions, its expenditures, or control its records. He could only submit the requirement of the Comptroller to the Commission and its response to the Comptroller. Its response was 'that so much of the Comptroller's communication as requires copies of telegrams relating to the business of the Commission to accompany telegraph vouchers for which credit is asked be disregarded by the secretary and disbursing agent, the Commission holding that such messages are so far confidential as to justify refusal to disclose their contents, and that the requirement for their production is unreasonable and against public interest.' This was a substantial compliance with the requirement of the Comptroller.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Judgment affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>187 U.S. 322 (1902)</b></center>\n<center><h1>UNITED STATES<br>\nv.<br>\nMOSELEY.</h1></center>\n<center>No. 248.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Argued October 28, 1902.</center>\n<center>Decided December 1, 1902.</center>\nAPPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.\n<p><i>Mr. Assistant Attorney General Pradt</i> for appellants.</p>\n<p><i>Mr. Holmes Conrad</i> for appellee.</p>\n<p>MR.

Cl. 347, in the sum of three hundred and ten dollars and thirty-seven cents ($310.37).\"</p>\n<p>The case is in narrow compass. There is no controversy over the fact of expenditure of the sum sued for, and the Court of Claims found that \"the accounts and itemized vouchers were presented to the accounting officers in the form prescribed by statute; that is to say, that each telegram sent by the Commission, and the cost thereof, and the dates, number of words, persons <span class=\"star-pagination\">*326</span> from and to whom sent, places from and to which sent, and the charge for each message transmitted, were fully shown in a voucher approved by Martin A. Knapp, chairman, and the defendants concede the correctness of the several amounts so expended.\"</p>\n<p>Relying on a former decision between the same parties, 35 Court Claims, 347, the court evidently thought that the issue made by the government was not substantial. In that case it was said: \"The claimant's statement of account being in the form prescribed by statute, <i>i.e.,</i> `itemized vouchers therefor, approved by the chairman of the Commission,' is <i>prima facie</i> correct. The defendants do not controvert the fact of the expenditures therein shown to have been made under the direction of the Commission, nor of the money paid into the Treasury; and, as under the circumstances of this case we have no reason to doubt the correctness or legality of such expenditures, the claimant is entitled to recover, and judgment will be entered accordingly.\"</p>\n<p>The case comes, therefore, to a very narrow question. The act to regulate commerce as amended March 2, 1889, Supp. Rev. Stat. 2d ed. 690, provides \"all of the expenses of the Commission . . . shall be allowed and paid on the presentation of itemized vouchers therefor approved by the chairman of the Commission.\" The appropriation act of the same (Supp. Rev. Stat.2d ed. 698) date provides: \"That hereafter expenses of the Interstate Commerce Commission shall be audited by the proper accounting officers of the Treasury.\"</p>\n<p>It is claimed that these provisions can be reconciled and leave unimpaired the first as the only condition of the allowance and payment of the expenses of the Commission. Not passing upon that but granting the power of the auditing officers to require something more, we think their requirement was substantially complied with.</p>\n<p>It is to be remembered that the petitioner (appellee) is but the Secretary of the Commission. He does not direct its functions, its expenditures, or control its records. He could only submit the requirement of the Comptroller to the Commission and its response to the Comptroller. Its response was \"that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*327</span> so much of the Comptroller's communication as requires copies of telegrams relating to the business of the Commission to accompany telegraph vouchers for which credit is asked be disregarded by the Secretary and disbursing agent, the Commission holding that such messages are so far confidential as to justify refusal to disclose their contents, and that the requirement for their production is unreasonable and against public interest.\" This was a substantial compliance with the requirement of the Comptroller.</p>\n<p><i>Judgment affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 95735, "judges": "McKenna", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/95735/", "sha1": "262710de546763c991cedfb42fa1537c4d857ec9", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:40:14"}
