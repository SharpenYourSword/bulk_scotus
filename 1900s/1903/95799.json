JUSTICE BREWER delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>In September, 1892, the plaintiff in error, the owner of five <span class=\"star-pagination\">*517</span> lots on Williams street, in Schaefer's addition to the city of Huntington, Indiana, with other lot owners, petitioned the city council to have the street graded and graveled. On July 10, 1893, the petition was granted and the street ordered to be so improved. After this improvement had been ordered some of the lot owners petitioned the city council to order the street paved with brick. This petition was presented on August 14, 1893. A remonstrance was at the same time presented, the plaintiff in error being one of the parties thereto. Notwithstanding the remonstrance the city council ordered that the street be paved with brick, and let a contract therefor to the defendants in error. They completed the work according to the contract, and the lots abutting on Williams street were assessed for the cost thereof \u0097 the assessment being made by the front foot \u0097 and a precept to collect the amount due on the lots of the plaintiff in error issued to the city treasurer. Further proceedings were had on appeal, in accordance with the provisions of the statute, which ended in a decision of the Supreme Court, 156 Indiana, 704, affirming the validity of the assessment, on the authority of <i>Adams</i> v. <i>City of Shelbyville,</i> 154 Indiana, 467, and thereupon the case was brought here on writ of error.</p>\n<p>The case involves the validity of a statute of Indiana known as the \"Barrett law,\" enacted in 1889. Sections 4288 to 4298, Burns Rev. Stat. 1894. We deem it sufficient to refer to the opinion in <i>Adams</i> v. <i>City of Shelbyville, supra</i><i>,</i> in which the Supreme Court of Indiana closed an elaborate discussion of the various provisions of the law in these words:</p>\n<p>\"We therefore conclude that section 3, acts 1889, \u00a7 4290, Burns 1894, must be construed as providing a rule of <i>prima facie</i> assessments in street and alley improvements, which allotments by the city or town engineer, under section 6 of said act of 1889, \u00a7 4293, Burns 1894, are subject to review and alteration by the common council and board of trustees, under section 7 of said act of 1889, as amended, acts of 1891, p. 324; acts 1899, p. 64; \u00a7 4294, Burns 1894, upon the basis of actual special benefits received by the improvement; and that under said section 7, the common council of a city, or board of trustees of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*518</span> an incorporated town, have not only the power, but it is their imperative duty, to adjust the assessments for street and alley improvements, under said act, to conform to the actual special benefits accruing to each of the abutting property owners.\"</p>\n<p>Of course, the construction placed by the Supreme Court of a State upon its statutes is, in a case of this kind, conclusive upon this court. <i>Forsyth</i> v. <i>Hammond,</i> 166 U.S. 506, 518, and cases cited.

The record of the city council shows that 'after some discussion on the matter Mr. Levy moved to place the communication on file, which motion was concurred in.'

She further averred that she could and would have shown by witnesses that the improvement was not necessary, and also 'that by reason of the refusal of the said action thereon the said city of Huntington, Indiana, is estopped from proceeding to collect any benefits assessed on the lots herein described.' The circuit court sustained a demurrer to this answer.
