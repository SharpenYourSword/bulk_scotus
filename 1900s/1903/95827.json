The cause was tried before a jury and resulted in a verdict and judgment thereon April 10, 1902. The record shows \"that no further proceedings were had in said cause after the entry of said judgment until, to wit, the 17th day of April, 1902, on which day plaintiff filed his motion asking leave to amend his petition,\" to the effect \"that leave be granted him to now amend his said original and first amended petition by inserting therein the following: `And is a citizen of said State and of the United States of America,' after the allegation made in said pleading `that plaintiff resides in El Paso, in El Paso County, State of Texas.'\" In support of the motion plaintiff stated under oath \"that he is now and was at the date of the filing of his original petition herein, and was on the 22d day of July, 1901, the date of his injuries, a <i>bona fide</i> citizen of the United States of America and of the State of Texas.\" The court granted leave to so amend and defendant excepted.
