CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>William F. Roberts brought an action against J.S. Barton Key and James P. Scott, in February, 1901, before a justice of the peace of the District of Columbia, and recovered judgment for $196.30, whereupon Key and Scott carried the case by appeal to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, giving an undertaking on appeal with the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company as surety. The case was tried in the District Supreme Court and resulted in a judgment in favor of Scott and against Key and the Guaranty Company. From this judgment Key alone prosecuted an appeal to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, without summons and severance or any equivalent. Roberts moved to dismiss on two <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> grounds: (1) The want of parties, <i>Mason</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 136 U.S. 581; <i>Hardee</i> v. <i>Wilson,</i> 146 U.S. 179; (2) That the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction on appeal from the judgment of the court below in such cases.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals had held in <i>Groff</i> v. <i>Miller,</i> 30 Wash. Law Rep. 434, that such an appeal could not be maintained, and accordingly dismissed the appeal in this case on the second ground. 30 Wash. Law Rep. 436. Key then applied to this court for leave to file a petition for mandamus requiring the Court of Appeals to reinstate the appeal and proceed to a hearing and determination of the same on the merits.

It is not granted in doubtful cases, or where there is another adequate remedy, and whether it shall go or not usually rests in the sound discretion of the court.
