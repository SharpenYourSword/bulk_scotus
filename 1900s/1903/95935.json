In other words, it is contended that under the statute of the State, which we have quoted, the city was given the power to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*156</span> construct an electrical plant and erect poles, etc., to \"supply private lights for the use of the inhabitants of the city,\" or it could grant that right \"to any person or persons or corporation\" upon such terms as might be prescribed by ordinance. It chose the latter, and granted to the assignors of appellee the right given by the statute and expressed it to be \"in consideration of the benefits to be derived therefrom.\" And it is hence contended that thereby the city contracted not to build works of its own, and that by doing so it violated section 10 of the Constitution of the United States, which provides that no State shall \"pass any law impairing the obligation of a contract,\" and also violated that clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of that instrument which provides that no State \"shall deprive any person of property without due process of law.\"</p>\n<p>It is by implication from the statute and the ordinance passed under it, not from the explicit expression of either, that the conclusion is deduced that the city is precluded from erecting its own lighting plant, and yet it is conceded that the grant to the appellee is not exclusive. That is, it is conceded the city has not exhausted its power under the statute by the grant held by appellee, but may make another to some other person than the appellee. In other words, that the city may make a competitor to appellee, but cannot itself become such competitor. The strength of the argument urged to support the distinction is in the consideration that competition by the city would be more effective than competition by private persons or corporations \u0097 indeed, might be destructive. The city, it is further urged, could be indifferent to profits and could tax its competitor to compensate losses. But this is speculation and it may be opposed by speculation, and there are besides countervailing considerations. The limitation contended for is upon a governmental agency, and restraints upon that must not be readily implied. The appellee concedes, as we have seen, that it has no exclusive right, and yet contends for a limitation upon the city which might give it (the appellee) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*157</span> a practical monopoly. Others may not seek to compete with it, and if the city cannot, the city is left with a useless potentiality while the appellee exercises and enjoys a practically exclusive right. There are presumptions, we repeat, against the granting of exclusive rights and against limitations upon the powers of government.</p>\n<p>Many cases illustrate this principle, and some of them were decided in response to contentions similar to those made in the case at bar. In <i>Skaneatales Water Works Co.</i> v. <i>Skaneatales,</i> 184 U.S. 354, the village of Skaneatales, under statutes of the State of New York, granted to the water company the right to construct waterworks, and contracted with it to supply water to the village and its inhabitants for the period of five years. At the expiration of the term of the contract some difference arose about the terms of its continuance, and the village constructed an independent system of waterworks. A suit was brought by the water company to restrain the further construction of the works and their operation, and the company contended that under the statute of the State, by which the village granted to the company its franchises, the village had the election to construct works, or confer such power upon a private company like the water company, and having elected the latter, it impliedly contracted not to construct works of its own. In reply to this contention this court said (p. 363), by Mr. Justice Peckham:</p>\n<p>\"There is no implied contract in an ordinary grant of a franchise, such as this, that the grantor will never do any act by which the value of the franchise granted may in the future be reduced.

The village of Skaneatales had entered into a contract with the water company to take water from the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*158</span> company. This contract had expired before the city constructed its works. It was not that contract, however, which was alleged to have been impaired, but that which the water company claimed to have been implied by reason of its organization and incorporation and in pursuance of the application made to and with the consent of the village authorities. The ultimate reliance, therefore, of the water company was that from the grant to it the village impliedly contracted not to construct works of its own. The similarity of the contention with that in the case at bar is apparent.</p>\n<p>In <i>Bienville Water Supply Company</i> v. <i>Mobile,</i> 175 U.S. 109; 186 U.S. 212, it was again decided that the granting of franchises to private persons to construct waterworks in a city does not preclude the city from afterwards erecting such works and supplying its inhabitants with water.</p>\n<p><i>Walla Walla</i> v. <i>Walla Walla Water Co.,</i> 172 U.S. 1, is not in opposition to these views.

It was made perpetual upon final hearing, and a decree was entered enjoining the city 'from supplying or furnishing to the inhabitants, residents, or any other person, firm, or corporation within said city, or any addition thereto or extension thereof, electric lights, either incandescent or arc, or in any other form or manner, for commercial or private lighting, for and during the full term' of the grant to the predecessors and assignors of appellee, to wit, the term of twenty years from and after October 7, 1891. 113 Fed. 817.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A statute of Missouri (Laws 1891, p. 60) authorizes cities to erect, maintain, and operate electric light works, to light the streets, and supply the inhabitants with light for their own use, and to establish rates therefor. Or they may, the statute provides, 'grant the right to any person or persons or corporation to erect such works . . . upon such terms as may be prescribed by ordinance, provided further that such right . . . shall not extend for a longer period than twenty years.' Subsequently to, and in pursuance of, this statute, the city, by ordinance, October 7, 1891, granted the right to erect and maintain an electric light plant to certain persons, naming them, their successors and assigns, for a period of twenty years. The plant was erected at considerable expense, and has ever since been maintained and operated. The appellee is the successor of the original grantees.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ordinance conferred rights and exacted obligations, and fixed, besides, the rates to be charged. It also provided for its written acceptance within ten days after its passage, and the commencement of the work within sixty days. It was accepted.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently (March, 1899), the city, acting in pursuance of, and in the manner provided in, certain ordinances, issued bonds to the amount of $30,000, 'for the purpose of erecting an electric light plant, to be owned, controlled, and operated by the city,' and by the means obtained thereby constructed electrical works, erected poles and wires, established a schedule of rates, and entered into the business of commercial electrical lighting in competition with appellee. The bill alleged that the appellee was the owner of real and personal property within the city, which is assessed by the city for municipal taxation, and that appellee is compelled, by reason of such taxation, 'to aid and assist in operating and maintaining defendant's (the city's) electric plant and business as a rival and competing one' with appellee's electrical plant and business.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Messrs.</i> C.

It chose the latter, and granted to the assignors of appellee the right given by the statute, and expressed it to be 'in consideration of the benefits to be derived therefrom.' And it is hence contended that thereby the city contracted not to build works of its own, and that by doing so it violated &#167; 10 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States, which provides that no state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of a contract, and also violated that clause of the 14th Amendment of that instrument, which provides that no state shall deprive any person of property without due process of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is by implication from the statute and the ordinance passed under it, not from the explicit expression of either, that the conclusion is deduced that the city is precluded from erecting its own lighting plant, and yet it is conceded that the grant to the appellee is not exclusive.
