It was and is further contended that plaintiff in error had entered into contracts with certain persons and corporations in the State for the sale and delivery of its publications, which contracts were still in force and effect, and under which plaintiff in error had incurred liability; and if the statutes be construed as applicable to it they would impair the obligations of those contracts and be in violation of section ten of article one of the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p>A motion is made to dismiss on the ground that the judgment of the Supreme Court has been complied with.

And, it is alleged, that the same defences were made as in the case at bar. It is hence contended that \"there still exists a controversy, undetermined and unsettled,\" involving the right of the State to enforce the statute against a corporation engaged in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>The motion to dismiss must be granted.
