The duties were levied under an order of the President dated July 12, 1898. The case of Peabody &amp; Company was decided on demurrer to the answer of the United States, which set up that during the time mentioned there existed an armed insurrection in the Philippine Islands, of such size as to call for military operations by the United States; that, although Manila was in our possession, it was held only by force of arms as a part of hostile territory, and that the President's order was a lawful exercise of the war power of the United States. The district court overruled the demurrer and dismissed the suit. (Not reported.) The case of Warner, Barnes, &amp; Company was decided on a finding of facts by the court of claims, and that court also dismissed the petition. ___ Ct. Cl. ___.

It was a measure taken with reference to that war alone, and not with reference to the insurrection of the native inhabitants of the Philippines, which declared hostilities on February 4, 1899. declared hostitlities on February 4, 1899. The natural view would be that the order expired by its own terms when the war with Spain was at an end. The order directs that 'upon the occupation of any forts and places in the Philippine Islands by the forces of the United States' the duties shall be levied and collected 'as a military contribution.' Of course, this was not a power in blank for any military occasion which might turn up in the future. It was a regulation for and during an existing war, referred to as definitely as if it had been named. See <i>Dooley</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 182 U.

In that case it was decided that after the title passed to the United States there was nothing in the Philippine insurrection of sufficient gravity to give to the islands the character of foreign countries within the meaning of a tariff act. That means that there was no such 'firm possession' by an organized hostile power as made Castine a foreign port in the war of 1812. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Rice</i>, 4 Wheat. 246, 254, 4 L. ed. 562, 564. Whatever sway the Philippine government may have had in Luzon, we suppose that probably at any time the United States could have sent a column of a few thousand men to any point on the island, as was stated by the Secretary of War in his report in 1899, and as the United States was willing that the court of claims should find.

Manila was not like Nashville during the Civil War, a part of a state recognized as belligerent and as having impressed a hostile status upon its entire territory. <i>Hamilton</i> v. <i>Dillin</i>, 21 Wall. 73, 94-96, 22 L. ed. 528, 533, 534. The fact that there was an insurrection of natives not recognized as belligerents in another part of the island, or even just outside its walls, did not give the President power to impose duties on imports from a country no longer foreign. <i>See Dooley</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 182 U.
