The aggregate amount claimed was $8,646.49, with interest at the rate of 25 per cent per annum. The cases were consolidated and submitted to the district court on an agreed statement of facts with exhibits attached, a jury being waived, and resulted in a judgment, October 9, 1902, for $5,156.71 with interest at 6 per cent per annum. This included the $276.21 with interest. Appellees sued out writs of error from the supreme court of the territory. No cross writ of error was brought and no cross errors were assigned. In the supreme court the item of $276.21 with interest was not contested. February 26, 1903, the supreme court announced its conclusion that the judgment be reversed, but as the item of $276.21 was not contested, rendered judgment for that amount, thereby rejecting the sum of $4,880.50 of the judgment below, that sum with interest at 6 per cent amounting to less than $5,000 on that date. 11 N. M. 669, 72 Pac. 14. From the judgment so rendered the territory prosecuted an appeal to this court, under the act of Congress in that behalf, January 17, 1905, and prayed in its assignment of errors that the judgment of the supreme court be reversed and set aside, and the cause be 'remanded to said supreme court, with directions to affirm the judgment of the district court of Grant county.' The appeal was heard in this court on January 26, 1906, and on that day appellant filed an additional assignment of errors to the effect that the supreme court of New Mexico erred in failing to hold that appellant was entitled to interest at the rate of 25 per cent per annum from October 9, 1902. But the judgment of the district court gave interest at 6 per cent, and, as before stated, the territory did not complain of that judgment as rendered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the act of March 3, 1885 (23 Stat. at L. 443, chap. 355, U.
