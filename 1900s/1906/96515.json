Prior to the court of appeals act of 1891, provision was made for an appeal to the circuit court in habeas corpus cases 'from the final decision of any court, justice, or judge inferior to the circuit court' (Rev. Stat. &#167; 763, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 594); and from the final decision of such circuit court an appeal might be taken to this court (Rev. Stat. &#167; 764, as amended March 3, 1885, chap. 353, 23 Stat. at L. 437, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 595).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The law remained in this condition until the court of appeals act of March, 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 828, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549], was passed, the 5th section of which permits an appeal directly from the district court to this court 'in any case in which the constitutionality of any law of the United States, or the validity or construction of any treaty made under its authority, is drawn in question.' In this connection the appellee insists that an appeal will not lie, but that a writ of error is the proper remedy. In support of this we are cited to the case of Bucklin v. United States, 159 U. S. 680, 40 L. ed. 304, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 182, in which the appellant was convicted of the crime of perjury, and sought a review of the judgment against him by an appeal, which we held must be dismissed, upon the ground that criminal cases were reviewable here only by writ of error. Obviously that case has no application to this, since, under the prior sections of the Revised Statutes, above cited, which are taken from the act of 1842, an <i>appeal</i> was allowed in habeas corpus cases. The observation made in the Bucklin Case that 'there was no purpose by that act to abolish the general distinction, at common law, between an appeal and a writ of error, may be supplemented by saying that it was no purpose of the act of 1891 to change the forms of remedies theretofore pursued.

Prior to the court of appeals act of 1891, provision was made for an appeal to the circuit court in habeas corpus cases 'from the final decision of any court, justice, or judge inferior to the circuit court' (Rev. Stat. &#167; 763, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 594); and from the final decision of such circuit court an appeal might be taken to this court (Rev. Stat. &#167; 764, as amended March 3, 1885, chap. 353, 23 Stat. at L. 437, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 595).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The law remained in this condition until the court of appeals act of March, 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 828, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549], was passed, the 5th section of which permits an appeal directly from the district court to this court 'in any case in which the constitutionality of any law of the United States, or the validity or construction of any treaty made under its authority, is drawn in question.' In this connection the appellee insists that an appeal will not lie, but that a writ of error is the proper remedy. In support of this we are cited to the case of Bucklin v. United States, 159 U. S. 680, 40 L. ed. 304, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 182, in which the appellant was convicted of the crime of perjury, and sought a review of the judgment against him by an appeal, which we held must be dismissed, upon the ground that criminal cases were reviewable here only by writ of error. Obviously that case has no application to this, since, under the prior sections of the Revised Statutes, above cited, which are taken from the act of 1842, an <i>appeal</i> was allowed in habeas corpus cases. The observation made in the Bucklin Case that 'there was no purpose by that act to abolish the general distinction, at common law, between an appeal and a writ of error, may be supplemented by saying that it was no purpose of the act of 1891 to change the forms of remedies theretofore pursued.
