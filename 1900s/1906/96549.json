Va. Code 1887, &#167;&#167; 1291, 1292. On November 2, 1903, Hughes, the defendant in error, handed to the Western Union Telegraph Company, at its office in Danville, Virginia, a message to be transmitted by wire to Pocahontas, Virginia, and there delivered to the addressee. In regular course such message would have gone by way of Bluefield, West Virginia. It reached that point, but was not sent further. For failure to make delivery Hughes sued the telegraph company in the corporation court of the city of Danville to recover the statutory penalty, and obtained a judgment. Error was prosecuted to the supreme court of appeals of Virginia, upon the contention that the transmission of the message in question was interstate commerce, and not subject to the statutory regulations of Virginia, heretofore referred to. The appellate court, however, held (104 Va. 240, 51 S. E. 225) that the case was ruled by a prior decision (Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Reynolds, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></span>, 93 Am. St. Rep. 971, 41 S.

This, however, we cannot do. It is immaterial that the supreme court of appeals was vested by the state Constitution with appellate jurisdiction in all cases involving the constitutionality of a law as being repugnant to the Constitution of Virginia or of the United States, or that, in the opinion delivered by the court, it discussed the Federal question and declared it to be without merit. The fact is undoubted that the writ of error was dismissed solely and expressly because of a want of jurisdiction, and the effect of the formal entry, adjudging that the court was without jurisdiction to pass upon the questions presented by the writ of error, cannot be different from what it would have been had the court not given expression to its views in a written opinion. The necessary result of the ruling that the court had not jurisdiction of the writ of error was to determine that the trial court was the final court where the questions presented by the writ could be decided; and, hence, the writ of error should have been directed to that court.
