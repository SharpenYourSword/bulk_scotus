JUSTICE BREWER delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>This case, like the two preceding, was a prosecution of the express company for a violation of the Kentucky statute in respect to \"C.O.D.\" shipments. It was tried in the Circuit Court before a jury, which returned a verdict of guilty and fixed the penalty at one hundred dollars fine, which verdict was sustained and judgment entered thereon by the Circuit Court.

The brief of the Attorney General in the Court of Appeals, after referring to the testimony of a witness on behalf of the company, said:</p>\n<p>\"It will appear from his evidence that he resides in Cincinnati, Ohio, and is manager for a wholesale liquor firm located in said city; that on March 21st, 1905, he received an order filed as an Exhibit `X' from Richard Graham of Hodgensville, Ky., for an order of whiskey to be sent C.O.D., for the delivery of which the warrant herein was issued against the appellant company; that upon this order the whiskey in question was shipped to said Graham at Hodgensville, Ky., and delivered to him and the charges therefor paid to the appellant company, who returned the same to the said house or firm in Cincinnati, Ohio. There is no proof to show that the express company had any knowledge or information as to the contents of said package so delivered, and there is nothing to show any notice to it whatever of the contents of said package.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * * * * * * *</h2>\n<p>\"We, however, desire the court to pass upon the question, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*141</span> in order that the many complications growing out of transactions similar to this may be simplified, and the multitude of litigations growing out of the same lessened, whether or not a company similar to the appellant can legally accept the price for whiskey shipped into a local option district contrary to law, thus constitute itself a collecting agency for one who is under the shield of interstate commerce protected and permitted to ship whiskey into such districts. We are of opinion that an express company has no inherent right under the laws of this State or under the protection of interstate commerce to assume a duty not required of it, as a common carrier, and to do that which is in violation of the laws of this State. Because we believe that this record in its present shape does not show that the appeal from the police court to the Circuit Court of Larue County was properly and legally taken, and for the further reason that the express company has no right, in violation of law, to accept the price in a local option district of whiskey shipped C.O.D., we ask that the judgment be affirmed.\"</p>\n<p>In view of the concession and contention of the Attorney General we are of the opinion that there is nothing to substantially distinguish this case from the preceding.
