The agricultural college claimed that under the acts of Congress bestowing these gifts it is entitled to them, and the denial of the Supreme Court of the State of this claim raises the Federal question first to be considered.</p>\n<p>By the act of July 2, 1862 (12 Stat. 503), amended by act of March 3, 1883 (22 Stat. 484), Congress \"granted to the several States, for the purposes hereinafter mentioned, \"certain quantities of the public lands, or, under certain conditions, in lieu thereof land scrip.

By the act of March 2, 1887 (24 Stat. 440), Congress directed that a certain sum should be annually appropriated \"to each State\" for the support of agricultural experiment stations at the institutions established under the act of 1862. The law provides that the appropriation shall be paid to the treasurer of the institution where the agricultural experiment station is established, and no money has come or will come into the hands of the state treasurer. It is, therefore, unnecessary to consider further the provisions of this act. There is in the hands of the state treasurer the permanent fund established under the act of 1862, and one of the annual <span class=\"star-pagination\">*284</span> appropriations paid to him under the act of 1890. The interest on the fund and the annual appropriation the state treasurer is about to pay to the University of Wyoming in obedience to the laws of the State. The agricultural college claims that it is entitled under those statutes to receive this money. If this claim fails it is the end of the case. But, as has been shown, both the fund and its interest and the annual appropriations are the property of the State and not of any institution within it. The agricultural college shows no title or right to this money under these statutes. The whole case of the plaintiff in error fails at the threshold, and it is unnecessary to determine whether the State has complied with its trust in bestowing the Government bounty upon the University of Wyoming or has violated the obligation of a contract by repealing, as it has, the act establishing the agricultural college. These questions were discussed with learning and ability in the court below, and we do not intend to intimate any disagreement with the conclusions of that court. But as the plaintiff in error must fail in the attempt to compel the payment to it of the money in the hands of the defendant for the reasons already given, there is no need to go further in this court, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Wyoming is therefore</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>",

An alternative writ issued, and the respondent appeared and demurred to the petition. The cause was then heard by the supreme court of Wyoming, and by that court the demurrer, which was regarded by court and counsel as sufficiently raising the merits of the controversy, was sustained and judgment rendered for the respondent.
