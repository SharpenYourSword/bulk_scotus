It declared, however, the preponderance of proof sustained the contention \"that there is a variation in the reading of the polariscope, according to variations in temperature at the place where the sugar is tested, and that the corrections and additions provided for by the regulations merely consist in an addition of 3 per cent for each 10 degrees Centigrade of temperature above that at which the polariscope is standardized, and that in this way the actual amount of pure sucrose in each sample is more accurately determined than was the case under the old eye test.\"</p>\n<p>The Circuit Court of Appeals (131 Fed. Rep. 833) reversed the Circuit Court and sustained the General Appraisers. It held Congress intended there should be a scientific determination, by means of the polariscope, of sucrose contents, and that the method prescribed by the Treasury regulations was proper in order to secure the desired result.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*160</span> The rulings are correctly stated in the headnotes thus:</p>\n<p>\"In construing the provision in paragraph 209, tariff act July 24, 1897, c. 11, sec. 1, schedule E, 30 Stat. 168 (U.S. Compiled St. 1901, p. 1647), regulating duty on sugars according to the polariscopic test, <i>held</i> that the expressions therein, `testing by the polariscope' and `shown by the polariscopic test,' are not used with any special trade meaning that would confine them to a particular method of conducting such test, but import an intention on the part of Congress that the method adopted should be the one best calculated to make a scientific determination.</p>\n<p>\"Under the general power of the Secretary of the Treasury to make customs regulations not inconsistent with law, granted by section 251, Rev. Stat. (U.S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 138), it is competent for that officer to prescribe the method of `testing by the polariscope' the sugars dutiable according to such test under paragraph 209, tariff act July 24, 1897, c. 11, sec. 1, schedule E, 30 Stat. 168 (U.S. Comp. 1901, p. 1647); and so long as he acts in good faith, and it does not appear that his regulations operate to make the polariscopic test less accurate than when Congress adopted it, the courts should not interfere with the administrative details confided to him.</p>\n<p>\"Where, for a period of years covering the operation of several tariff acts, the Secretary of the Treasury has made regulations for carrying out certain provisions in those acts, it is to be presumed that subsequent legislation by Congress was enacted with reference to such regulations.\"</p>\n<p>At October term, 1904, a petition for a writ of certiorari to bring up these cases for review was presented to this court, and denied. 195 U.S. 635.</p>\n<p>In the present cause counsel stipulated:</p>\n<p>\"It is agreed that the sugars in question were tested and classified in accordance with the Treasury regulations of October 27, 1897, and of February 17, 1899, and that the questions raised are the same as those in the cases of <i>Joseph E.

In the aforementioned cases there was no certificate for instruction on any question or proposition of law, and the application for certiorari was denied. The present direct appeal to this court is a mere attempt to obtain a reconsideration of questions arising under the revenue laws and already determined by the Circuit Court of Appeals in due course. Such direct appeals, under § 5 of the act of 1891, cannot be entertained unless the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States is involved.</p>\n<p>This is conceded, and counsel for appellant attempt to sustain the jurisdiction on the ground that the regulations assumed to add something to the dutiable standard prescribed by the tariff act, and that in doing so the Secretary exercised legislative power confided by the Constitution solely to Congress. But this does not constitute a real and substantial dispute or controversy concerning the construction or application of the Constitution upon which the result depends.</p>\n<p>The admitted duty of the Secretary of the Treasury was to construe as best he could the paragraph relating to collection of duty upon sugars, and to promulgate regulations for carrying it into effect. Rev. Stat. § 251. This and this alone he did. The only real substantial point involved is whether or not he misconstrued the statute, and that gives this court no jurisdiction <span class=\"star-pagination\">*162</span> upon direct appeal. <i>Sloan</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96055\"><a href=\"/opinion/96055/sloan-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">614</span></a></span>, 620, and cases cited; <i>United States ex rel.
