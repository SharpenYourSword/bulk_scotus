[34 Stat. at L. 1246, chap. 2564, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1907, p. 209.] The indictment charged a conspiracy in violation of &#167; 5440, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3676), to unlawfully acquire land of the United States under the timber and stone act. The court gave to the indictment the same construction which it affixed to the indictment in the case of United States v. Biggs, No. 289 [211 U. S. 507, 53 L. ed. &#8212;&#8212;, 29 Sup. Ct.
