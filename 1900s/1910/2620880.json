JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>The parties to this record are the same as in No. 514, just decided, <i>ante,</i> p. 563, and the questions involved are the same, the prosecution being for similar offenses against the Connecticut act of 1907. Both cases were tried together. Upon the conviction in this, however, the trial court imposed the penalty of imprisonment. The two cases were disposed of by the Supreme Court of Errors in one opinion. As the decision in No. 514 is necessarily controlling, it follows that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut must be and it is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>",
