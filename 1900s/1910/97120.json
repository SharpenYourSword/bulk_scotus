The shares of stock in the plaintiff bank were assessed by the assessor on the basis of the book or assessed value, obtained by adding the capital, surplus, and undivided profits of the bank, and dividing the sum total by the number of shares of capital stock, to ascertain the value of one share, a proper deduction having been made on account of real estate owned by the bank. The board of review and equalization raised the assessed valuation of the shares to $130 per share. The bank and its shareholders appeared before the board, and objected to its action and to the valuation fixed by them as being in excess of the actual value, and exorbitant and unjust. The bank contended that the stock was not assessed and valued in proportion to other like personal property in the city of Estherville, but was grossly in excess thereof, and constituted unfair and unequal taxation, and that the taxable value of the shares of the stock in the bank should be found as the assessor had previously found it. But the board adhering to its own judgment, plaintiffs perfected an appeal to the district court of Emmett County, Iowa. In that court plaintiffs filed a pleading containing taining a recital of the facts and demanding relief, and reiterating the same contention as made below, and the same claim as to the proper manner to arrive at the assessable valuation of said shares of stock. Answer was filed in behalf of the board, wherein it was denied that the assessment, as raised, was unjust, and asserted that the market value was the proper criterion for valuation, and that the actual and market value of the stock in question was even greater than that fixed in the raised assessment. It was also denied that the assessment was unfair as related to the assessment on other like property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sustained the action of the board of review, whereupon the case was appealed to the supreme court of Iowa, which affirmed the decree of the district court. 136 Iowa, 203, 112 N. W. 829. In the supreme court it was contended for the first time that the action of the board worked a violation of &#167; 5219 of the United States Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3502), touching upon state taxation of national bank shares. Because of the fact that such matter was not presented to the board or suggested on the trial in the court below, the supreme court refused to entertain the question.

This contention is, through the action of the defendant board, as complained of, there was worked a violation of &#167; 5219 of U. S. Revised Statutes, having to do with the subject of state taxation of national bank shares. As confessedly such matter was not presented to the board, or suggested on the trial in the court below, we cannot give consideration thereto on merits in this court.

These were not Federal questions. No mention of the national banking act was made, nor any right or privilege claimed under it, nor were the provisions of the Revised Statutes invoked, by name or otherwise. There was no assertion of an issue in the case claiming the local statutes to be in conflict with, or repugnant to the terms of, &#167; 5219 of the Revised Statutes, or the Constitution of the United States. Plaintiffs filed a written pleading in the district court, in which they set out all proceedings leading up to the appeal and the grounds for their complaint against the action of the equalization board, and when the case went to trial filed an amendment, alleging the additional grievance of inequality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1322 of the Iowa Code reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'National, State, and Savings Banks.&#8212;Shares of stock of national banks shall be assessed to the individual stockholders at the place where the bank is located.
