He was tried and convicted, and on June 17, 1907, sentenced to 'be imprisoned in the penitentiary situated at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, for the term and period of his natural life, at hard labor.' He was committed accordingly, and received at the United States penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas, by the warden, R. W. McClaughry, June 21, 1907.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">November 29, 1907, Childers filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States district court for the district of Kansas.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal contention was that the United States court in the Indian territory had no jurisdiction of the offense committed by Childers during the interim between the passage of the Oklahoma enabling act and the admission of the state, in view of the language of the enabling act, and especially of &#167; 14. Some minor errors, not jurisdictional, were assigned. The district court considered the terms of the act, construed &#167; 14, and denied the petition, and from that judgment an appeal was taken directly to this court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Oklahoma enabling act, approved June 16, 1906, provided:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Sec. 13. That said state, when admitted, as aforesaid, shall constitute two judicial districts, to be known as the eastern district of Oklahoma and the western district of Oklahoma; the said Indian territory shall constitute said eastern district and the said Oklahoma territory shall constitute said western district. . . . The circuit and district courts for each of said districts, and the judges thereof, respectively, shall possess the same powers and jurisdiction, and perform the same duties, required to be performed by the other circuit and district courts and judges of the United States, and shall be governed by the same laws and regulations. . . .</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Sec. 14. That all prosecutions for crimes or offenses hereafter committed in either of said judicial districts, as hereby constituted, shall be cognizable within the district in which committed, and all prosecutions for crimes or offenses committed before the passage of this act, in which indictments have not yet been found or proceedings instituted, shall be cognizable within the judicial district as hereby constituted in which such crimes or offenses were committed.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Sec. 15. That all appeals or writs of error taken from the supreme court of Oklahoma territory, or the United States court of appeals in the Indian territory, to the Supreme Court of the United States or the United States circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit, previous to the final admission of such state, shall be prosecuted to final determination as though this act had not been passed. And all cases in which final judgment has been rendered in such territorial appellate courts, which appeals or writs of error might be had except for the admission of such state, may still be sued out, taken, and prosecuted to the Supreme Court of the United States or the United States circuit court of appeals under the provisions of existing laws. . . .</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Sec. 16.

That all cases pending in the supreme court of said territory of Oklahoma and in the United States court of appeals in the Indian territory, not transferred to the United States circuit and district courts in said state of Oklahoma, shall be proceeded with, held, and determined by the supreme or other final appellate court of such state as the successor of said territorial supreme court and appellate court, subject to the same right to review upon appeal or error to the Supreme Court of the United States now allowed from the supreme or appellate courts of a state under existing laws.

Prosecutions for all such offenses committed within either of said territories and pending in the supreme court of the territory of Oklahoma, or in the United States court of appeals in the Indian territory, upon the admission of such territories as a state, shall be transferred to the United States circuit courts created by this act for the district within which the offense was committed. . . .</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Sec. 17.
