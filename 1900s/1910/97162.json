It was averred in the bill that the defendant prosecuting attorneys would, unless restrained by the order of the court, institute numerous actions, as they had threatened to do, for the recovery of the penalties aforesaid. The learned district judge sustained the demurrer to the bill, and dismissed the case upon the ground that the action is, in effect, a suit against the state of Arkansas, and for that reason prohibited by the 11th Amendment to the Federal Constitution.

In that case the previous cases in this court concerning the application of the 11th Amendment of the Constitution were fully considered, and it was then said by Mr. Justice Peckham, speaking for the court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The various authorities we have referred to furnish ample justification for the assertion that individuals who, as officers of the state, are clothed with some duty in regard to the enforcement of the laws of the state, and who threaten and are about to commence proceedings, either of a civil or criminal nature, to enforce against parties affected an unconstitutional act, violating the Federal Constitution, may be enjoined by a Federal court of equity from such action.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This doctrine is precisely applicable to the case at bar.
