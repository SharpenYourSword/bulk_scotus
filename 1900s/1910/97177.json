A motion is made to dismiss it on the ground that the amount in dispute does not exceed $5,000.

But by reference to the opinion in No. 116 it will be seen that the supreme court rested its decision upon the construction of the statutes, not upon the want of power in the legislature to pass them. As to the acts themselves, the supreme court said: 'It does not seem necessary or profitable in this case to consider the question of the power of the legislature, for the reason that however adequate the power of the legislature might be, if the legislature did not see fit, nor intend to exercise the power to declare the office of assessor of Bernalillo county vacant by the legislation enacted, the legal right of the incumbent elected by the people of the county is not affected by the legislation, and no vacancy existed, to be filled either by election or appointment.'

And further said that it was hence led to the logical conclusion 'that even if it was admitted that Sandoval had been for years and was still residing in what would become Sandoval county when the act took effect, that fact would neither disqualify Sandoval from holding his office nor have the effect of rendering the office vacant.' And again: 'The legislature acted upon a mistaken view of the law, the result of which was to provide for the election of an officer to an office not vacant, but which, on the contrary, was in the possession of a legally elected and qualified incumbent.' It was also decided that Albright's appointment was made before the law took effect, and necessarily was illegal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the second appeal of the case, the court did not enlarge on the ground of its decision. 13 N. M. 64, 79 Pac. 719, 11 A. &amp; E. Ann. Cas. 1165. It follows that as Sandoval's right to the office and Albright's want of right were based upon the construction of the statutes of the territory, not upon power of the legislature to pass them, the motion to dismiss must be granted, and it is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
