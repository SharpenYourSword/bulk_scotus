The act of 1841 added \"merchants.\" The act of 1867 extended practically to all persons and corporations.

It is not limited by the means used in making, nor by the kind of product produced. In <i>Kidd</i> v. <i>Pearson,</i> 128 U.S. 1, 20, Mr. Justice Field said that \"manufacture is transformation, the fashioning of raw material into a change of form or use.\"</p>\n<p>In <i>Tide Water Oil Company</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 171 U.S. 210, 216, Mr. Justice Brown, referring to the expansion of the meaning of the word \"manufacture,\" said that \"the word is now ordinarily used to denote an article upon the material of which labor has been expended to make the finished product.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*455</span> Concrete is an artificial stone. It is a product resulting from a combination of sand or gravel or broken bits of limestone, with water and cement; a combination which requires ordinarily the use of both skill and machinery. It is not denied that if concrete in a shape adapted to use and in finished form is supplied to others for the making of a house, bridge, pier, arch or abutment, that the corporation making such blocks or shapes would be in the most narrow sense one engaged in manufacture. But it is urged that this corporation made these blocks or shapes at the place where used, and that, as finished, they became a part of a principal structure and affixed to the realty; and that, therefore, they were not engaged in manufacturing, which, say counsel, is a business confined to those who make articles which may be \"transported and sold at some other place than that where made.\"</p>\n<p>The production of concrete arches, or piers, or abutments, is the result of successive steps. The combination of raw material, the sand, the limestone, the cement and the water produced a product, which undoubtedly was \"manufactured.\" This concrete had then to be given shape. That required the manufacture of moulds, which remain in place until hardening occurs. If the concrete is reinforced, as is the case where great strength is required, then the adjustment of the bars of steel within the moulds was another step. Do all of these steps, each a step in \"manufacturing,\" cease to be \"manufacturing\" because the moulds into which the concrete is poured, when in a fluid state, are upon the spot where the finished product is to remain? That the operation of making and shaping the concrete is done at the place used seems rather a matter of convenience, due to the quick hardening in moulds and difficulties of transportation. But, as we may take notice, the operation which in the end is to produce an arch, or abutment, or pier, or house, is not necessarily a single operation, but one of successive repetitions of the process.

If the builder made his brick, shaped his timbers, and joined them all together, he would plainly be a manufacturer as well as a builder; and if the former was the principal part of the business, he would be within the definition of the bankrupt act.

Upon a petition for review, filed by a judgment creditor, the adjudication was set aside upon the ground that the construction company was not 'a corporation engaged principally in manufacturing,' as found by the bankrupt court. The opinion of the circuit court of appeals is reported in 87 C. C. A. 23, 158 Fed. 593.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the agreed statement of facts it appears:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1st. That the Monongahela Construction Company's charter sets out that it was organized 'for the purpose of constructing, erecting, and repairing railroads, traction lines, duly incorporated, and streets, roads, buildings, structures, works or improvements of public or private use or utility.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2d. That its principal business had been 'making and constructing arches, walls, and abutments, bridges, buildings, etc., out of concrete.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3d. That, 'in carrying on its business, it buys and combines together raw materials, such as cement, gravel, and sand in the making of concrete, and supplies labor, machinery, and appliances necessary for the proper carrying on of said business, of constructing and erecting concrete arches, piers, buildings, and structures, and excavating therefor at such time and place as its contracts call for.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4th. It has no permanent shop or factory, but has a warehouse.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Messrs. Alexander J. Barron and Richard A.
