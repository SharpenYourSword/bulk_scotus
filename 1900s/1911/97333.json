As there was evidence proper for the consideration of the jury, the objection that the verdict was against the weight of evidence, or that the damages allowed were excessive, cannot be considered.

It appears that the witness was appointed by the court to examine the plaintiff below in order to ascertain his condition at the time of the trial, and that this action was taken with the consent of the counsel for the defendant (the plaintiff in error). The examination was made and the witness subsequently testified without objection. In fact, the counsel for the plaintiff in error conducted the direct examination, and there was no cross-examination. No question, therefore, is presented with respect to the admissibility of this testimony. The bill of exceptions was amended so as to show that the court stated, when the testimony was introduced, not only that the physician's examination had been made by consent, but that counsel had 'agreed that his evidence should be considered as correct.' This amendment, as the district judge states, was to conform the record to the fact. Assuming, as we must, that the statement was made by the court, it does not appear that it was unjustified or that it was objected to. The exception of the plaintiff in error is simply to its inclusion in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is further insisted that the court erred in refusing to allow one Dr. Gonzalez to testify. As to this, the record merely sets forth that counsel 'offered to present the testimony of one Dr. Gonzalez, as an expert, which testimony is not allowed by the court, and to which ruling of the court counsel for defendant thereupon noted an exception.' Manifestly, the judgment cannot be set aside because of this ruling, for it does not appear what testimony the witness was expected to give, or that he was qualified to give any.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have examined the other rulings of which plaintiff in error complains, with respect to the striking out of certain testimony, and we find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>219 U.S. 44 (1910)</b></center>\n<center><h1>HERENCIA<br>\nv.<br>\nGUZMAN.</h1></center>\n<center>No. 46.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Submitted November 29, 1910.</center>\n<center>Decided December 19, 1910.</center>\nERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR PORTO RICO.\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> <i>Mr. Willis Sweet</i> for plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p><i>Mr. Frederick L.
