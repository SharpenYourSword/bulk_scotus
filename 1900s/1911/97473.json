It was not, however, until February 19, 1909 \u0097 nearly sixteen months after the entry of the order and following the disallowance by the court of the claims of certain creditors which had been allowed by the referee \u0097 that this proceeding was commenced to obtain a review of the order and judgment of October 25, 1907. The proceeding for review was begun by the filing in the court below of a document styled \"Petition for a Writ of Review to the United States District Court for Porto Rico,\" verified and certified as such by the attorney for Munsuri, which document, however, although couched in part in the phraseology of a petition, is also in form a writ of error directed to the judge of the court below.

On the other hand the contention is that the proceeding may be sustained as an appeal solely upon the question of jurisdiction under \u00a7 5 of the Judiciary Act of 1891, or as a petition to superintend and revise in matter of law, under section 24<i>b</i> of the Bankruptcy Act.
