(\u00a7 11, c.) But the statute is otherwise silent as to the right of the bankrupt himself to begin a suit in the time which intervenes between the filing of the petition and the election of the trustee. There is a conflict in the conclusions reached in the few cases dealing with this question. <i>Rand</i> v. <i>Sage,</i> 94 Minnesota, 344; <i>Rand</i> v. <i>Iowa Central R.

The institution of such suit will result in no harm to the estate. For if the trustee prefers to begin a new action in the same or another court in his own name, the one previously brought can be abated. If, however, he is of opinion that it would be to the benefit of the creditors, he may intervene in the suit commenced by the bankrupt, and avail himself of rights and priorities thereby acquired. <i>Thatcher</i> v. <i>Rockwell,</i> 105 U.S. 467.</p>\n<p>If, because of the disproportionate expense, or uncertainty as to the result, the trustee neither sues nor intervenes, there is no reason why the bankrupt himself should not continue the litigation.

If the trustee will not sue and the bankrupt cannot sue, it might result in the bankrupt's debtor being discharged of an actual liability. The statute indicates no such purpose, and if money or property is finally recovered, it will be for the benefit of the estate. Nor is there any merit in the suggestion that this might involve a liability to pay both the bankrupt and the trustee. The defendant in any such suit can, by order of the bankrupt court, be amply protected against any danger of being made to pay twice. <i>Rand</i> v. <i>Iowa Central R.

B. Johnson, as executor, recovered judgment against B. T. Collier, in the city court of Gadsden, Alabama. Execution thereon was levied July 20, 1906, on certain personal property.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under a provisions of the Alabama statute, Collier immediately filed with the sheriff a claim of exemption. On the same day he filed, in the proper district court of the United States, a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, including this property in his schedule of assets. Notwithstanding the claim of exemption, the sheriff sold the property at public outery on July 30, 1906.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, on a date not shown by the record, Collier was adjudicated a bankrupt. On August 8, 1906, before a trustee was elected, he brought suit against both Johnson and the sheriff for damages, on the theory that the sale of the property after the filing of the claim of exemption made them trespassers <i>ab initio</i>. The defendants filed a plea, in which they set up the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings, and alleged that Collier had no title to the cause of action, which was <i>in gremio legis</i> until the election of the trustee, and for that reason he could not maintain a suit for damages occasioned by the unlawful sale of property included in the schedule of assets. A demurrer to this plea was sustained. The jury found a verdict in favor of Collier, which the trial court refused to set aside. This ruling was affirmed, and the case is here on writ of error from that judgment of the supreme court of Alabama.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. George D.
