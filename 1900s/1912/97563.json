Marshall,  Plffs. in Err.,<br>v.<br>MARSHALL ENGINE COMPANY, by Andrew Van Blarcom,  Its Receiver.</p>\n    <p class=\"docket\">No. 107.</p>\n    <p class=\"date\">Submitted December 15, 1911.</p>\n    <p class=\"date\">Decided February 19, 1912.</p>\n    <div class=\"prelims\">\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 1, 1886, Letters Patent 342,802, were issued to Frank J. Marshall for an improvement in pulp-beating engines. Shortly before the patent expired he organized the Marshall Engine Company, and on September 15, 1902, assigned to it the patent and 'all improvements thereon and renewals of the same.' Marshall was elected president of the company, but neglected to have the assignment recorded within the time required by law. It contained, however, a provision for further assurance, and on October 8, 1904, after the patent had expired, Marshall executed an additional instrument whereby, after reciting the former assignment, he transferred the patent and 'all further improvements thereon and renewals thereof.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September, 1903, at the time the first assignment was made, Marshall had on file an application for a patent on 'an improvement on patent 411,251, granted to E. R. Marshall, and embodies features shown in patent 342,802, granted in 1886 to myself.' There is no further reference in the record to patent 411,251. Marshall's application was granted, and on April 14, 1903, Letters Patent 725,349 were granted to him.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No formal assignment was made, but it is found as a fact that, between September 15, 1903, and the receivership, the complainant manufactured nine or ten engines embodying the improvement covered by patent 725,349.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 13, 1905, a receiver was appointed for the Marshall Engine Company. Immediately thereafter, Marshall organized under the laws of Massachusetts a new company bearing his name, and assigned to it this patent 725,349. The New Marshall Engine Company took with notice of the complainant's right.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Marshall Engine Company, of New Jersey, claimed title to this patent 725,349 as an 'improvement' on patent 342,802, which passed by virtue of the assignment of September 15, 1902. It thereupon filed, through its receiver, a bill in the superior court of Franklin County, Massachusetts, asserting this title, and praying that the defendants, Marshall and the New Marshall Engine Company, should be required to execute and deliver to it an assignment in due form to patent 725,349, so as to entitle it to be recorded in the Patent Office, and also that the defendants, their successors and assigns, should be enjoined from manufacturing or selling machines covered by patent 725,349.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants answered, admitting or denying the several allegations of the bill, but setting up no affirmative defense. The case was referred to a master, who found in favor of the complainant. Thereupon the defendants moved to dismiss the bill because 'it presents questions involving an inquiry as to the construction and scope of the patents therein mentioned, of which questions the Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.' The motion was overruled, and a final decree was entered in favor of the complainants. The decision was affirmed by the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts, and the case was brought here by writ of error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Messrs. Edmund A. Whitman, Lyman W. Griswold, and Frank J. Lawler for plaintiffs in error.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Argument of Counsel from pages 475-478 intentionally omitted]</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Walter H.

The present litigation belongs to this class. The controlling fact for determination here is whether patent 725,349 belongs to the Marshall Engine Company, of New Jersey, or to the New Marshall Engine Company, of Massachusetts. The complainant did not, by its bill in the state court, raise any question as to the validity or construction of the patent, nor did it make any claim for damages for infringement.

The injunction was asked for only as an incident of a finding that the title was vested in the complainant.
