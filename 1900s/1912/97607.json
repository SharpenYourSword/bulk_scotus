The defendant prevailed in the state courts (81 Kan. 101, 105 Pac. 221), and the plaintiff brings the case here.

S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3174, which made it unlawful for any common carrier engaged in interstate commerce by railroad 'to haul or permit to be hauled or used on its line any car <i>used in moving interstate traffic</i>, not equipped with couplers coupling automatically by impact,' etc. The petition, if liberally construed, charged that defendant was a common carrier engaged in interstate commerce by railroad; that the cars in question were not equipped with couplers of the prescribed type, and that the plaintiff's injuries proximately resulted from the absence of such couplers; but there was no allegation that either of the cars was then or at any time used in moving interstate traffic. The supreme court of the state held that in the absence of such an allegation the petition did not state a cause of action under the original act. We think that ruling was right. The terms of that act were such that its application depended, first, upon the carrier being engaged in interstate commerce by railroad, and, second, upon the use of the car in moving interstate traffic. It did not embrace all cars used on the line of such a carrier, but only such as were used in interstate commerce. Southern R. Co. v. United States, 222 U. S. 20, 25, 56 L. ed. 72, 32 Sup. Ct.

Error is assigned upon this ruling; but as it involved only a question of pleading and practice under the laws of the state, it is not subject to review by us. Texas &amp; N. O. R. Co. v.
