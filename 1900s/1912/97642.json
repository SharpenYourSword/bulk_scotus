Monroe and Samuel S. Gannett, two of the commissioners who were appointed by the decree entered in this cause on the 31st day of May, 1910, to run, locate, and permanently mark, with suitable monuments, the Deakins or old state line, as the boundary line between the states of Maryland and West Virginia, from low-water mark on the southern bank of the North Branch of the Potomac river to the Pennsylvania line, and to overrule said exceptions and confirm said report, which report is in the words and figures following, to wit:</p>\n    <div class=\"prelims\">\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the Honorable Chief Justice and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We, Julius K. Monroe and Samuel S. Gannett, two of the commissioners appointed under the decree of the court rendered May 31, 1910, 'to run, locate, and establish and permanently mark with suitable monuments the said Deakins or 'old state line' as the boundary line between the states of Maryland and West Virginia from said point (low-water mark) on the southern bank of the North Branch of the Potomac river to the said Pennsylvania line, etc.,' have the honor to submit the following report and map entitled, 'Map Showing The Boundary Line Between Maryland and West Virginia, from the Potomac River to the Pennsylvania State Line, as Surveyed and Marked under the Decree of the Supreme Court of the United States, Rendered May 31, 1910,' etc.:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The party was organized and went into camp on July 12, 1910, on Arnold's ridge, about 1 mile north of the North Branch of the Potomac river, and immediately began the survey of the line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning at the Fairfax stone, a line was first run north 0x56' E. along a well-marked line to a planted stone marked B/'1101', at the southwest corner of military lot No. 1101, originally a 'bounded maple standing 1 mile north from a stone fixed by Lord Fairfax for the head of the North Branch of the Potowmack river.' The intersection of this line with the south bank of the North Branch of the Potomac (at lowwater mark) was, under the decree of the court, fixed as the corner of Maryland and West Virginia, and monument No. 1 was therefore erected at this place and became the initial point of the boundary line run in 1910 and 1911.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the corner of lot 1101 B, where monument No. 2 was erected, the line deflects slightly to the west and follows the old marked line on the course N. 0x47'53\"E. as identified by the surveyors in the case in 1897 and shown on the maps filed by the defendants. This line crosses Arnold's ridge, Laurel run, Backbone mountain, Youghiogheny river, and where it intersects the 3d line of a Maryland tract called 'Covent Garden' monument No. 4 was erected and an offset was made to the west. The 3d line of Covent Garden was followed for a distance of 402.15 feet on the course N. 71x48' W. (true) to a planted stone, acknowledged by residents and owners of adjoining property and pointed out by them as being the limit of their respective claims, at this point. Monument No. 5 was built over this stone and the line was run N. 0x27'04\" E. in a manner to follow the property lines, as acknowledged by the citizens of the two states; passing over the center of a planted stone property corner, which marked the beginning of the Maryland tract called Mount Pleasant, surveyed in 1774. Monument No. 6 was built over and around this stone, which was pointed out by witnesses as marking the place of the original corner, a white oak tree. Continuing on the same course, a large anciently marked white oak tree was reached and identified as the beginning of a Virginia tract of land surveyed for John Pettyjohn in 1781, and also a corner of John T. Goff 1,000 acres, survey made in 1782, both of which call for the boundary line. This tree was cut and blocks taken out by your commissioners which showed surveyors' ax marks in the wood; one one hundred and thirty years old, and one one hundred and seventeen years, and the last seventy-eight years, thus indisputably establishing this course as following the oldest marked line extant. The stump of this tree was removed and monument No. 8 was built in the exact spot occupied by it. Upon trial it was found that from this white oak, northward, the line between property holdings of citizens in the two states verged to the eastward, and a slight angle was therefore made to the east and the boundary line run N. 0x42'57\" E. to the stump of a bounded sugar tree, the northwest corner of a maryland tract called Elshine; this tree, while standing, was identified by the surveyors in this case in 1897, and also by of a Maryland tract called Eelshine; this that time, has been cleared, and the timber destroyed by fire. The stump of this sugar tree was again pointed out to the commissioners, in 1910, by Peter F. Nine, the present owner of the tract Eelshine. This stump was removed and monument No. 10 erected exactly where it stood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this point the boundary line runs S. 89x 17' 03\" E. 482.3 feet along the line common to the tract Eelshine and the Virginia grant to Wm. Ashby for 50 acres, to the southwest corner of the Maryland tract called Buckdale. As the southwest corner of Buckdale and the southeast corner of the Ashby 50-acre tract, which are common, could not be definitely located upon the ground, as all original objects marking them have been destroyed, this point was determined by the intersection of a line produced southward passing through known and accepted points in the 'old line,' namely, 'the stake and stone pile,' on Lauer Hill, which is the common corner of the Maryland tract called 'Maryland,' and the Virginia grant to John Hoye for 500 acres, and which was identified and located by the surveyors in this case in 1897, and shown at Red 'C-6' upon Map No. 1, filed by defendants, and again identified by your commissioners in 1910; and a point north of the B. &amp; O. Railroad near Hutton, Maryland, in the property line between lands of the Connell heirs and George Morris. Monument No. 11 was placed at the intersection of the line above described with the line eastward from monument No. 10. The course of the boundary from monument No. 11, as above determined, is N. 0x41'02\" E., following closely the lines of the original Virginia grants, and passing through, or very near, the several points indicated upon map No. 1 filed in this case by defendants, and testified state line,' to a point on Glover's hill, 1 1/2 state line,' to a point on .glover's hill, 1 1/2 miles north of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, where monument No. 15 was erected. From this point northward it was found that the general course of the property lines verged slightly to the west, and the course of the boundary was here changed to N. 0x22'27\" E. to conform thereto, following the well-marked divisional lines between the F. &amp; W. Deakins 6,000-acre Virginia grant, and the Maryland military lots (Nos. 1237 to 1245) and the eastern line of the Hoye and Martin 3,600-acre Virginia grant, passing over the summits of Snaggy mountain and through the southern end of the Pine swamp to a point where this line intersects the southern line of the John Crane 776-acre Virginia grant, a short distance north of the Cranesville and Oakland road, as indicated upon the maps filed by the defendant in this case. This point was determined by reproducing upon the ground the southern line of said 776-acre Crane survey. Monument No. 19 was erected at this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From monument No. 19 an offset of 971.09 feet was made along the south line of the John Crane 776-acre tract N. 89x 27' 27\" E. to its intersection with the west boundary of Maryland military lot No. 1292, where here turns northward, following the west here turns notthward, following the west limit of military lots 1292, 1294, 1296, 1298, 1400, and 1402 as laid out by Francis Deakins, on a true course of N. 0x17'00\" E. to the northwest corner of military lot 1402. Monument No. 21 was placed at this point and an offset made 53.69 feet S. 89x43'00\" E. along the north side of lot 1402 (which is also the division line between lands of E. F. Jenkins and M. H. Frankhouser), where monument No. 22 was erected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From monument No. 22 the course of the boundary is N. 0x24'42\" E., passing through, or near the point where a large marked red oak formerly stood, testified to in this case by Ethbell Falkenstine, as standing in the Deakins or old state line, and shown at the letters 'W-K' upon the maps heretofore filed; a planted stone, a short distance north of the red oak in the east line of the Henry Banks survey of 8,000 acres, and following a well-marked line along and with the eastern boundary of the Banks survey and the western boundary of the Maryland tract called 'Canrobert' to a point where it intersects the south line of the 328-acre tract granted by Virginia to Henry Deal, and passing through the same, to a point where the east line of the Banks survey intersects the south line of a tract of 367 acres granted by Virginia to Henry Deal, where monument No. 27 was erected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From monument No. 27 an offset was made 347.3 feet N. 89x 25' 12\" E. along the made 347.3 feet N. 89x25'12\" E. along the above mentioned, where monument No. 28 was placed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From monument No. 28 to monument No. 32 the course of the boundary is N. 0x 20' 32\" the course of the boundary is N. 0x20'07\" W. and closely follows the mutually accepted states; corners, trees, and fences having been pointed out by various landowners on both sides of the 'old line.' Monument No. 32 replaces a large marked Spanish oak, which was a common corner of lands owned by John and George W. Vansickle, in West Virginia, and in the west line of land owned by W. M. Fike in Maryland. This tree was cut down and the stump removed by your commissioners in 1911. From this point northward it was found that the old accepted boundary line veered slightly to the east, and the course of the boundry line was therefore changed to N. 0x4'55\" E. to conform to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Monument No. 34 was set at the intersection of this line with the southern boundary line of the state of Pennsylvania.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the monuments just mentioned as standing at the angular points in the boundary, others were set between, exactly in line. (See description of monuments.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The total number of large monuments erected along the Maryland-West Virginia boundary line is 34, in addition to the one restoring the 'Fairfax stone.' Of small monuments, 26 were erected, making a total of 60 permanent marks. The line is also marked at suitable places by 5 copper bolts securely fastened into natural and planted rocks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A description of instruments and methods used in the survey, the method of constructing the monuments, location, latitude, longitude, approximate elevation, distance, true and magnetic bearings, will be found in the following pages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instruments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following instruments were used in making the survey: Theodolite, 7 1/2 inch No. 11, United States &amp; Canada Boundary Survey, temporarily loaned during 1910 to this survey. In 1911, 7 1/2 inch theodolite No. 219 of United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, loaned by the Superintendent of that Bureau in place of No. 11. No. 219 is lighter, works more freely, and is altogether much more satisfactory than No. 11. The circles on both theodolites are graduated to 10' spaces and read by verniers to 10\". With these instruments the line was ranged out from hilltop to hilltop and flagpoles set at intervals of 1 to 4 miles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2 Gurley transits, circles 5 1/2 inches diameter reading by vernier A to minutes and by vernier B to hundredths of a degree, loaned by Julius K. Monroe. With these transits the line was run from flagpole to flagpole, previously located with the theodolite, in the usual manner with double backsights and foresights. The length of foresight was limited by the length of tape, 500 feet; the length of backsight was limited only by the visibility of the rear tripod. Instead of the ordinary rods for lining in, brass plumb bobs weighing 2 pounds each, supported by tripods 7 feet high, with movable heads, were used. As sights were taken on the string supporting the plumb bobs, the line was produced with great accuracy. A brass tack was set in a solid hub at each transit station.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Distances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Distances were measured to the nearest 1/100 of a foot with a 500-foot standardized steel tape, supported at several points along its length so as to have a uniform slope, approximately parallel to the slope of the ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inclination or slope of the tape was measured by the vertical circle on the transit, and the horizontal distance and difference in elevation carefully computed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides the 500-ft. steel tape, which was graduated to single feet, except at each end, where 1 foot was graduated to tenths, a 100-foot steel tape graduated throughout to feet, tenths, and hundreths was used for shorter measurements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Astronomical observations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Astronomical observations for azimuth were obtained with the theodolite by observing Polaris near eastern elongation. Ten measurements of the angle between star and mark were made with telescope direct and reversed in 5 positions of the circle. The mark was a bulls-eye lantern placed at one of the transit stations a mile or more distant, northward. Time was obtained from the railroad; a mean time Waltham watch being compared with 75th meridian time as set by telegraph from the United States Naval Observatory at Washington each noon, and proper reduction was made for difference in longitude. Azimuth observations were made at 8 stations along the boundary line, 36.7 miles in length; usually at or near a point of deflection in the final line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Geodetic positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a point near Cranesville, West Virginia, 24 miles north of the Fairfax stone and 12 miles south of the Pennsylvania line, connection was made with Piney swamp triangulation station located by the United States Geological Survey by a belt of triangulation extending westward from Maryland heights and Sugarloaf, 2 primary triangulation stations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The geodetic position of Piney swamp station is on United States Standard datum, and is thus free from station error. A portion of the boundary line, 1.9 miles each of this station, measured during the progress of the survey, was used as a base line, and by measuring all the angles in 2 triangles accurate connection was made with this triangulation station. From these data the geodetic positions of all large monuments were computed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Elevations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The approximate elevations of all stations were determined by carrying a line of vertical angle measurements along the boundary. The elevation of Fairfax stone was accepted as 3,162 feet above mean sea level, as derived from railroad levels, and checks on the heights as computed from this were obtained at 5 points from the topographie work of the United States Geological Survey, as follows: Near Gnegy church; at the crossing of the Northwestern pike; at Hutton; near Cranesville; and at the intersection of the Maryland-West Virginia line with the Pennsylvania state line. The apparent errors at these check points were distributed at the various stations in proportion to the distance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Monuments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">List of monuments from the Fairfax stone to the Pennsylvania line, giving the size, method of construction, and location, together with the latitude and longitude of of each of the principal monuments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal monuments are uniform in size and shape, and consist of a molded concrete column, 22 inches square at the base, tapering to 10 inches square at 4 feet in height (top of mold), and finished, in a few instances, with rounded top, but generally in flat, pyramidal shape, extending 4 to 5 inches above the top of mold, or form, making the entire column 4 feet 4 inches in height above base; the corners are beveled 1 1/2 inches in width to prevent defacement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Inscriptions: Each monument, beginning with the initial one at the North Branch of the Potomac river, is numbered consecutively from 1 to 34 northward to the Pennsylvania state line; the numbers and the names of the commissioners being placed upon the south face of the monument, except where set diagonally; the date, 1910, on the north face; the letters MD. on the east, and W.

The cement and sand were thoroughly mixed before and after adding water; cement and stone were placed in the excavations in alternate layers and the whole thoroughly tamped and bonded. The base was finished and cross lines indicating its exact center marked upon it, and when firm enough to sustain the weight of the monument, the 'form' was set up and carefully centered by means of the cross lines, and the monument built before the final 'set,' thus forming the base and column into one solid mass. In the few instances where the bases were built a day or more before the monument, a large stone was set in the center of the base and allowed to project a foot or more above the surface, and the monument built around it, thus securing a firm bond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Small monuments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Small monuments are also of concrete, uniform in size, 1 foot square and 2 feet high, molded in a wooden form, without taper and contain 1 bag (100 pounds) cement, 2 bags (200 pounds) washed, white sand. The top was finished in a similar manner to the large monuments. The letters MD. cut on the east face, W. VA. on the west, and the date, 1910, on the north.

It derived its name from Thomas, Lord Fairfax, who became the proprietor of what was known as the 'Northern Neck of Virginia.' The original grant was made in 1663, by Charles II. of England, and subsequently successively confirmed by James II. and George II. The title having rested by transfers in Lord Fairfax, on the 7th of September, 1736, commissioners were appointed, with the approval of George II., to define the boundaries of the grant, which was to be 'all the land lying and situate between and within the heads of the rivers Rappahannock and Potomac, the courses of the said rivers, together with the rivers themselves.' The survey of the upper part of the Potomac river was made in 1736, and at the head spring as then determined a number of trees were marked by the surveyors. A dispute arose between Lord Fairfax and the representatives of the Colony of Virginia as to the source of the Potomac, and no further work or agreement reached until 1746, when representatives for each side having been named, the survey was resumed and a line was run from the head of the Rappahannock to the head of the Potomac river. The trees and springs located in the former survey of 1736, as the head of the potomac, having been found, the course of the trial line was corrected and the final line run in the reverse direction from the Potomac to the Rappahannock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before leaving the head of the Potomac, additional trees were marked and a stone set up, described as follows, in the notebook (still in existence) of Thomas Lewis, one of the surveyors: 'October 23, 1746.

Michler made his survey of the meridian line north from the Fairfax stone in 1859, he thus describes the stone in his report: 'The initial point of the work&#8212;the Fairfax stone stands on the spot encircled by several small streams flowing from springs about it. It consists of a rough piece of sandstone, indifferent and friable, planted to the depth of a few feet in the ground and rising a foot or more above the surface, shapeless in form, it would scarce attract the attention of the passerby. The finding of it was without difficulty, and its recognition and identification by the inscription Fx, now almost obliterated by the corroding action of water and air. In order not to disturb this stone the first observatory was built immediately in the rear (south) of it.' Here, later, Michler built his monument, which was about 4 feet in height and made of several hewn stones, the upper ones being conical. The original Fairfax stone was in existence until about the year 1883, when it was destroyed by vandals and subsequently carried away, leaving the Michler monument as the only marker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The stream surveyed in the year 1736 was what has since been designated the North Branch of the Potomac river. The source, designated as the Fairfax stone, is upon the divide between the eastern and western watersheds. It is 1/4 mile northerly from the summit of the Western Maryland Railroad, which is here the highest point on that line between Cumberland, Maryland, and Elkins, West Virginia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The stone is easily reached by a trail from Fairfax station, which is 1/2 mile to the southeast. The large timber all around has been cut by mill men and fire has destroyed the balance, so that the immediate spot is now largely covered by brush and briers. The land near the Fairfax stone is principally owned by the Davis Coal &amp; Coke Company (in 1910).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 12, 1910, during the present work, a new concrete monument was built, replacing both the previous marks. The new monument stands 2 feet north of the center of the base of the Michler monument, which point was marked by a brass bolt bedded level with surface of the ground. This rock and mark are still left in place, but are not visible, and the mark is 1 foot north of the point where the original stone stood. The portion of the Michler monument above ground was removed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Fairfax stone,' restored 1910.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The base is of concrete, 3 1/2 ft. square and 2 ft. deep, set flush with the surface of ground. On this base the monument was built, utilizing the form which had been designed for, and was afterwards used in the construction of, the monuments along the boundary from the Potomac river to the Pennsylvania line. The monument is 22 inches square at the base and 10 inches squre at the top, the latter being built up a few inches and rounded off. The total height being 4 ft. and 4 inches above the base.

Gannett, two of the commissioners appointed under the decree of the court rendered May 31, 1910, 'to run, locate, and establish and permanently mark with suitable monuments the said Deakins or 'old state line' as the boundary line between the states of Maryland and West Virginia from said point (low-water mark) on the southern bank of the North Branch of the Potomac river to the said Pennsylvania line, etc.,' have the honor to submit the following report and map entitled, 'Map Showing The Boundary Line Between Maryland and West Virginia, from the Potomac River to the Pennsylvania State Line, as Surveyed and Marked under the Decree of the Supreme Court of the United States, Rendered May 31, 1910,' etc.:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The party was organized and went into camp on July 12, 1910, on Arnold's ridge, about 1 mile north of the North Branch of the Potomac river, and immediately began the survey of the line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning at the Fairfax stone, a line was first run north 0x56' E. along a well-marked line to a planted stone marked B/'1101', at the southwest corner of military lot No. 1101, originally a 'bounded maple standing 1 mile north from a stone fixed by Lord Fairfax for the head of the North Branch of the Potowmack river.' The intersection of this line with the south bank of the North Branch of the Potomac (at lowwater mark) was, under the decree of the court, fixed as the corner of Maryland and West Virginia, and monument No. 1 was therefore erected at this place and became the initial point of the boundary line run in 1910 and 1911.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the corner of lot 1101 B, where monument No. 2 was erected, the line deflects slightly to the west and follows the old marked line on the course N. 0x47'53\"E. as identified by the surveyors in the case in 1897 and shown on the maps filed by the defendants. This line crosses Arnold's ridge, Laurel run, Backbone mountain, Youghiogheny river, and where it intersects the 3d line of a Maryland tract called 'Covent Garden' monument No. 4 was erected and an offset was made to the west. The 3d line of Covent Garden was followed for a distance of 402.15 feet on the course N. 71x48' W. (true) to a planted stone, acknowledged by residents and owners of adjoining property and pointed out by them as being the limit of their respective claims, at this point. Monument No. 5 was built over this stone and the line was run N. 0x27'04\" E. in a manner to follow the property lines, as acknowledged by the citizens of the two states; passing over the center of a planted stone property corner, which marked the beginning of the Maryland tract called Mount Pleasant, surveyed in 1774. Monument No. 6 was built over and around this stone, which was pointed out by witnesses as marking the place of the original corner, a white oak tree. Continuing on the same course, a large anciently marked white oak tree was reached and identified as the beginning of a Virginia tract of land surveyed for John Pettyjohn in 1781, and also a corner of John T. Goff 1,000 acres, survey made in 1782, both of which call for the boundary line. This tree was cut and blocks taken out by your commissioners which showed surveyors' ax marks in the wood; one one hundred and thirty years old, and one one hundred and seventeen years, and the last seventy-eight years, thus indisputably establishing this course as following the oldest marked line extant. The stump of this tree was removed and monument No. 8 was built in the exact spot occupied by it. Upon trial it was found that from this white oak, northward, the line between property holdings of citizens in the two states verged to the eastward, and a slight angle was therefore made to the east and the boundary line run N. 0x42'57\" E. to the stump of a bounded sugar tree, the northwest corner of a maryland tract called Elshine; this tree, while standing, was identified by the surveyors in this case in 1897, and also by of a Maryland tract called Eelshine; this that time, has been cleared, and the timber destroyed by fire. The stump of this sugar tree was again pointed out to the commissioners, in 1910, by Peter F. Nine, the present owner of the tract Eelshine. This stump was removed and monument No. 10 erected exactly where it stood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this point the boundary line runs S. 89x 17' 03\" E. 482.3 feet along the line common to the tract Eelshine and the Virginia grant to Wm. Ashby for 50 acres, to the southwest corner of the Maryland tract called Buckdale. As the southwest corner of Buckdale and the southeast corner of the Ashby 50-acre tract, which are common, could not be definitely located upon the ground, as all original objects marking them have been destroyed, this point was determined by the intersection of a line produced southward passing through known and accepted points in the 'old line,' namely, 'the stake and stone pile,' on Lauer Hill, which is the common corner of the Maryland tract called 'Maryland,' and the Virginia grant to John Hoye for 500 acres, and which was identified and located by the surveyors in this case in 1897, and shown at Red 'C-6' upon Map No. 1, filed by defendants, and again identified by your commissioners in 1910; and a point north of the B. &amp; O. Railroad near Hutton, Maryland, in the property line between lands of the Connell heirs and George Morris. Monument No. 11 was placed at the intersection of the line above described with the line eastward from monument No. 10. The course of the boundary from monument No. 11, as above determined, is N. 0x41'02\" E., following closely the lines of the original Virginia grants, and passing through, or very near, the several points indicated upon map No. 1 filed in this case by defendants, and testified state line,' to a point on Glover's hill, 1 1/2 state line,' to a point on .glover's hill, 1 1/2 miles north of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, where monument No. 15 was erected. From this point northward it was found that the general course of the property lines verged slightly to the west, and the course of the boundary was here changed to N. 0x22'27\" E. to conform thereto, following the well-marked divisional lines between the F. &amp; W. Deakins 6,000-acre Virginia grant, and the Maryland military lots (Nos. 1237 to 1245) and the eastern line of the Hoye and Martin 3,600-acre Virginia grant, passing over the summits of Snaggy mountain and through the southern end of the Pine swamp to a point where this line intersects the southern line of the John Crane 776-acre Virginia grant, a short distance north of the Cranesville and Oakland road, as indicated upon the maps filed by the defendant in this case. This point was determined by reproducing upon the ground the southern line of said 776-acre Crane survey. Monument No. 19 was erected at this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From monument No. 19 an offset of 971.09 feet was made along the south line of the John Crane 776-acre tract N. 89x 27' 27\" E. to its intersection with the west boundary of Maryland military lot No. 1292, where here turns northward, following the west here turns notthward, following the west limit of military lots 1292, 1294, 1296, 1298, 1400, and 1402 as laid out by Francis Deakins, on a true course of N. 0x17'00\" E. to the northwest corner of military lot 1402. Monument No. 21 was placed at this point and an offset made 53.69 feet S. 89x43'00\" E. along the north side of lot 1402 (which is also the division line between lands of E. F. Jenkins and M. H. Frankhouser), where monument No. 22 was erected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From monument No. 22 the course of the boundary is N. 0x24'42\" E., passing through, or near the point where a large marked red oak formerly stood, testified to in this case by Ethbell Falkenstine, as standing in the Deakins or old state line, and shown at the letters 'W-K' upon the maps heretofore filed; a planted stone, a short distance north of the red oak in the east line of the Henry Banks survey of 8,000 acres, and following a well-marked line along and with the eastern boundary of the Banks survey and the western boundary of the Maryland tract called 'Canrobert' to a point where it intersects the south line of the 328-acre tract granted by Virginia to Henry Deal, and passing through the same, to a point where the east line of the Banks survey intersects the south line of a tract of 367 acres granted by Virginia to Henry Deal, where monument No. 27 was erected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From monument No. 27 an offset was made 347.3 feet N. 89x 25' 12\" E. along the made 347.3 feet N. 89x25'12\" E. along the above mentioned, where monument No. 28 was placed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From monument No. 28 to monument No. 32 the course of the boundary is N. 0x 20' 32\" the course of the boundary is N. 0x20'07\" W. and closely follows the mutually accepted states; corners, trees, and fences having been pointed out by various landowners on both sides of the 'old line.' Monument No. 32 replaces a large marked Spanish oak, which was a common corner of lands owned by John and George W. Vansickle, in West Virginia, and in the west line of land owned by W. M. Fike in Maryland. This tree was cut down and the stump removed by your commissioners in 1911. From this point northward it was found that the old accepted boundary line veered slightly to the east, and the course of the boundry line was therefore changed to N. 0x4'55\" E. to conform to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Monument No. 34 was set at the intersection of this line with the southern boundary line of the state of Pennsylvania.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the monuments just mentioned as standing at the angular points in the boundary, others were set between, exactly in line.

Of small monuments, 26 were erected, making a total of 60 permanent marks. The line is also marked at suitable places by 5 copper bolts securely fastened into natural and planted rocks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A description of instruments and methods used in the survey, the method of constructing the monuments, location, latitude, longitude, approximate elevation, distance, true and magnetic bearings, will be found in the following pages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instruments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following instruments were used in making the survey: Theodolite, 7 1/2 inch No. 11, United States &amp; Canada Boundary Survey, temporarily loaned during 1910 to this survey. In 1911, 7 1/2 inch theodolite No. 219 of United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, loaned by the Superintendent of that Bureau in place of No. 11. No. 219 is lighter, works more freely, and is altogether much more satisfactory than No. 11. The circles on both theodolites are graduated to 10' spaces and read by verniers to 10\". With these instruments the line was ranged out from hilltop to hilltop and flagpoles set at intervals of 1 to 4 miles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2 Gurley transits, circles 5 1/2 inches diameter reading by vernier A to minutes and by vernier B to hundredths of a degree, loaned by Julius K. Monroe. With these transits the line was run from flagpole to flagpole, previously located with the theodolite, in the usual manner with double backsights and foresights. The length of foresight was limited by the length of tape, 500 feet; the length of backsight was limited only by the visibility of the rear tripod. Instead of the ordinary rods for lining in, brass plumb bobs weighing 2 pounds each, supported by tripods 7 feet high, with movable heads, were used. As sights were taken on the string supporting the plumb bobs, the line was produced with great accuracy. A brass tack was set in a solid hub at each transit station.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Distances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Distances were measured to the nearest 1/100 of a foot with a 500-foot standardized steel tape, supported at several points along its length so as to have a uniform slope, approximately parallel to the slope of the ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inclination or slope of the tape was measured by the vertical circle on the transit, and the horizontal distance and difference in elevation carefully computed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides the 500-ft. steel tape, which was graduated to single feet, except at each end, where 1 foot was graduated to tenths, a 100-foot steel tape graduated throughout to feet, tenths, and hundreths was used for shorter measurements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Astronomical observations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Astronomical observations for azimuth were obtained with the theodolite by observing Polaris near eastern elongation. Ten measurements of the angle between star and mark were made with telescope direct and reversed in 5 positions of the circle. The mark was a bulls-eye lantern placed at one of the transit stations a mile or more distant, northward. Time was obtained from the railroad; a mean time Waltham watch being compared with 75th meridian time as set by telegraph from the United States Naval Observatory at Washington each noon, and proper reduction was made for difference in longitude. Azimuth observations were made at 8 stations along the boundary line, 36.7 miles in length; usually at or near a point of deflection in the final line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Geodetic positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a point near Cranesville, West Virginia, 24 miles north of the Fairfax stone and 12 miles south of the Pennsylvania line, connection was made with Piney swamp triangulation station located by the United States Geological Survey by a belt of triangulation extending westward from Maryland heights and Sugarloaf, 2 primary triangulation stations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The geodetic position of Piney swamp station is on United States Standard datum, and is thus free from station error. A portion of the boundary line, 1.9 miles each of this station, measured during the progress of the survey, was used as a base line, and by measuring all the angles in 2 triangles accurate connection was made with this triangulation station. From these data the geodetic positions of all large monuments were computed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Elevations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The approximate elevations of all stations were determined by carrying a line of vertical angle measurements along the boundary. The elevation of Fairfax stone was accepted as 3,162 feet above mean sea level, as derived from railroad levels, and checks on the heights as computed from this were obtained at 5 points from the topographie work of the United States Geological Survey, as follows: Near Gnegy church; at the crossing of the Northwestern pike; at Hutton; near Cranesville; and at the intersection of the Maryland-West Virginia line with the Pennsylvania state line.

The base was finished and cross lines indicating its exact center marked upon it, and when firm enough to sustain the weight of the monument, the 'form' was set up and carefully centered by means of the cross lines, and the monument built before the final 'set,' thus forming the base and column into one solid mass. In the few instances where the bases were built a day or more before the monument, a large stone was set in the center of the base and allowed to project a foot or more above the surface, and the monument built around it, thus securing a firm bond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Small monuments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Small monuments are also of concrete, uniform in size, 1 foot square and 2 feet high, molded in a wooden form, without taper and contain 1 bag (100 pounds) cement, 2 bags (200 pounds) washed, white sand. The top was finished in a similar manner to the large monuments. The letters MD. cut on the east face, W. VA. on the west, and the date, 1910, on the north. The base, 2 feet square and 2 feet deep, also of concrete, and built as in the larger monuments.

It derived its name from Thomas, Lord Fairfax, who became the proprietor of what was known as the 'Northern Neck of Virginia.' The original grant was made in 1663, by Charles II. of England, and subsequently successively confirmed by James II. and George II. The title having rested by transfers in Lord Fairfax, on the 7th of September, 1736, commissioners were appointed, with the approval of George II., to define the boundaries of the grant, which was to be 'all the land lying and situate between and within the heads of the rivers Rappahannock and Potomac, the courses of the said rivers, together with the rivers themselves.' The survey of the upper part of the Potomac river was made in 1736, and at the head spring as then determined a number of trees were marked by the surveyors. A dispute arose between Lord Fairfax and the representatives of the Colony of Virginia as to the source of the Potomac, and no further work or agreement reached until 1746, when representatives for each side having been named, the survey was resumed and a line was run from the head of the Rappahannock to the head of the Potomac river. The trees and springs located in the former survey of 1736, as the head of the potomac, having been found, the course of the trial line was corrected and the final line run in the reverse direction from the Potomac to the Rappahannock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before leaving the head of the Potomac, additional trees were marked and a stone set up, described as follows, in the notebook (still in existence) of Thomas Lewis, one of the surveyors: 'October 23, 1746. Returned to the spring where we made the following marks: '&#8212;'on another beach WB WR 1746 Y3-a stone by the corner pine marked FX, on a beach marked 'AC.' This done we bid adieu to the head spring about 1/2 hour after nine o'clock, our course directing to the head of Rappahannock bearing S. 46x E. 30 poles the top of the mountain in the spring heads on.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Lieut. N. Michler made his survey of the meridian line north from the Fairfax stone in 1859, he thus describes the stone in his report: 'The initial point of the work&#8212;the Fairfax stone stands on the spot encircled by several small streams flowing from springs about it. It consists of a rough piece of sandstone, indifferent and friable, planted to the depth of a few feet in the ground and rising a foot or more above the surface, shapeless in form, it would scarce attract the attention of the passerby. The finding of it was without difficulty, and its recognition and identification by the inscription Fx, now almost obliterated by the corroding action of water and air. In order not to disturb this stone the first observatory was built immediately in the rear (south) of it.' Here, later, Michler built his monument, which was about 4 feet in height and made of several hewn stones, the upper ones being conical. The original Fairfax stone was in existence until about the year 1883, when it was destroyed by vandals and subsequently carried away, leaving the Michler monument as the only marker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The stream surveyed in the year 1736 was what has since been designated the North Branch of the Potomac river. The source, designated as the Fairfax stone, is upon the divide between the eastern and western watersheds. It is 1/4 mile northerly from the summit of the Western Maryland Railroad, which is here the highest point on that line between Cumberland, Maryland, and Elkins, West Virginia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The stone is easily reached by a trail from Fairfax station, which is 1/2 mile to the southeast. The large timber all around has been cut by mill men and fire has destroyed the balance, so that the immediate spot is now largely covered by brush and briers. The land near the Fairfax stone is principally owned by the Davis Coal &amp; Coke Company (in 1910).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 12, 1910, during the present work, a new concrete monument was built, replacing both the previous marks.
