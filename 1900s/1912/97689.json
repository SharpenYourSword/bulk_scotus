The affidavit of the plaintiff puts the value of the land in controversy at over $25,000 on the manifestly untenable ground that the church edifices are deprived of free egress and ingress by the decision, and the others seemingly mean that the parcel of land with the church buildings included is worth thirty thousand dollars, the buildings being valued at twenty-five thousand dollars \u0097 leaving five thousand dollars for the land in dispute.</p>\n<p>But the result is the same if we go further.

There is no question of law before us \u0097 for it hardly was argued, and could not be with any seriousness, that the Supreme Court was not authorized to review the evidence under \u00a7 497 of the Philippine Code, or that this court can consider whether it was right in finding the preponderance of evidence to be on the defendant's side.</p>\n<p><i>Appeal and writ of error dismissed.</i></p>\n</div>",
