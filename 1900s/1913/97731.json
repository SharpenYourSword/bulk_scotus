This writ of error is prosecuted to a judgment of the supreme court of Illinois (246 Ill. 26, 92 N. E. 591), affirming a judgment sustaining a demurrer to the petition in mandamus and denying the writ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among other contentions made by the plaintiff in error and passed upon by the supreme court of Illinois was one to the effect that he had become an officer of the classified service, and entitled to the protection against removal conferred by an act styled the civil service act, and that hence his removal from office without written charges preferred against him, and without notice and an opportunity to be heard, amounted to a denial of due process of law within the purview of the state Constitution and of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. But the court below held these claims not maintainable, on the ground that, upon a proper construction of the state statutes, the petitioner was not in the classified service, and was subject to removal. This ruling is binding upon us and presents no Federal question. Taylor v. Beckham, 178 U. S. 548, 44 L. ed. 1187, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 890, 1009. Even, however, if we were at liberty to disregard the action of the state court and attribute to the plaintiff in error the status claimed by him, as in addition the court below held that the right to the relief prayed was in any event barred by long delay and laches, this would be sufficient to prevent us from reviewing the alleged Federal question.

But the specific relief prayed was a writ of mandamus to restore plaintiff in error to the pay rolls as a policeman.
