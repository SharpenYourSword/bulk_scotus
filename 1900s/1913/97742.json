It was also shown that the schedule of tariff rates was based upon values, and that a higher rate was allowable if a higher value had been declared. It was claimed that a limitation of liability, made for the purpose of obtaining the lower of alternative rates, was admissible under the provisions of the 7th section of the interstate commerce act of June 29, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 584, chap. 3591, U.
