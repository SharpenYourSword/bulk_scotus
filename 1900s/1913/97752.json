I. &amp; P. R. Co. v. Hardwick Farmers Elevator Co. No. 25 of the present term [226 U. S. 426, 57 L. ed. , 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174] would be controlling as to the penalties allowed as an offset which accrued after June 29, 1906. As, however, the prior penalties allowed as an offset would in any event be not controlled by the case referred to, we come to consider the validity of the allowance of all of the offset, independent of the principle applied in that case. Approaching the subject from this point of view, we think the rule of the State Commission upon which the right to all the so-called 'delayage penalties' was based constituted an unreasonable burden upon interstate commerce within the decision in Houston &amp; T. C. R. Co. v. Mayes, 201 U. S. 329, 50 L. ed. 775, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 491, since the requirement as to the delivery of cars within the short period fixed in the rule is absolute, and makes no allowance whatever for any justifiable and unavoidable cause for the failure to deliver. In saying this we do not give controlling effect to the observation contained in the opinion of the court below, that no question was made as to the reasonableness of the regulation, since the opinion itself states that the ruling in the Mayes Case was the main reliance of the railroad company, and in the argument at bar both sides have discussed the case on the theory that the substantial question to be decided was whether the rule of the commission which the court below upheld was an unreasonable regulation, in view of the decision in the Mayes Case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the Supreme Court of Mississippi is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>227 U.S. 1 (1913)</b></center>\n<center><h1>YAZOO &amp; MISSISSIPPI VALLEY RAILROAD COMPANY<br>\nv.<br>\nGREENWOOD GROCERY COMPANY.</h1></center>\n<center>No. 54.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Argued November 14, 1912.</center>\n<center>Decided January 20, 1913.</center>\nERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI.\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2</span> <i>Mr. Edward Mayes</i> and <i>Mr. Charles N.
