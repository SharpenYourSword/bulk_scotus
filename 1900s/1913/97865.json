Andrews, bankrupt, deceased, a claim to such proceeds having been made by the executrix of Andrews's estate. An order having been entered in the district court in favor of the executrix, except as to the cash surrender value of the policies, the circuit court of appeals for the third circuit, upon a petition to revise, reversed the decree of the district court, and ordered that the proceeds pass entirely to the trustee. 41 L.R.A.(N.S.) 123, 112 C.

It further appears that Andrews died on February 15, 1910, having at that time, and at the time of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, two policies of insurance upon his life, one for $10,000, payable upon his death to his executors, administrators, or assigns, and the other for $5,000, payable upon his death to his estate. At the date of filing the petition in bankruptcy the $10,000 policy had a cash surrender value of $14.93, and was subject to a loan of $4,481.39; and the $5,000 policy had a cash surrender value of $100.

Construing &#167; 70a of the bankruptcy act, it decided, however, that the policies passed to the trustee, subject to the right of the bankrupt to pay or secure to the trustee the cash surrender value of the policies, and to continue to hold and own them, but that this right was extinguished by his death before adjudication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case was argued and submitted at the same time as the cases of Burlingham v.
