That at once suggests that the failure to make such application has been due to the conceded want of power to issue the writ to such officers. For, since the adoption of the Constitution, there have been countless rulings by heads of departments that directly affected personal and property rights and where the writ of certiorari, if available, would have furnished an effective method by which to test the validity of <i>quasi</i>-judicial orders under attack. The modern decisions cited to sustain the power of the court to act in the present case are based on state procedure and statutes that authorize the writ to issue not only to inferior tribunals, boards, assessors and administrative officers, but even to the Chief Executive of a State in proceedings where a <i>quasi</i>-judicial order has been made.

When later still its scope was enlarged so as to make it serve the office of a writ of error, certiorari was granted only in those instances in which the inferior tribunal had acted without jurisdiction, or in disregard of statutory provisions. But in those cases the writ ran to boards (<i>Reaves</i> v. <i>Ainsworth,</i> 219 U.S. 296), officers, tribunals and inferior judicatures, whose findings and decisions, even though erroneous, had the quality of a final judgment, and there being no right of appeal or other method of review, the extraordinary writ of certiorari was resorted to from necessity to afford a remedy where there would otherwise have been a denial of justice.

But the statute was passed primarily for the benefit of the public at large and the order was for them and their protection. That fact gave an administrative quality to the hearing and to the order and was sufficient to prevent it from being subject to review by writ of certiorari. The Postmaster General could not exercise judicial functions, and in making the decision he was not an officer presiding over a tribunal where his ruling was final unless reversed. Not being a judgment, it was not subject to appeal, writ of error, or certiorari. Not being a judgment, in the sense of a final adjudication, the appellants were not concluded by his decision, for had there been an arbitrary exercise of statutory power or a ruling in excess of the jurisdiction conferred, they had the right to apply for and obtain appropriate relief in a court of equity. <i>School of Magnetic Healing</i> v. <i>McAnnulty,</i> 187 U.S. 94. <i>Philadelphia Co.</i> v. <i>Stimson,</i> 223 U.S. 605, 620.</p>\n<p>The fact that there was this remedy is itself sufficient to take the case out of the principle on which, at common <span class=\"star-pagination\">*172</span> law, right to the writ was founded.

W. Degge and the Wellington corporations, of which he was president, were using the mails in furtherance of a fraudulent scheme. Notice was given to Degge and the corporations, and a hearing was had before the officer to whom, under the Postal Regulations, the disposition of this class of cases was committed. He found that the charges were true, and to his finding he attached a copy of all the evidence which had been taken. The report was confirmed by the Postmaster General, who issued an order directing the postmaster at Boulder, Colorado, not to deliver mail addressed to Degge or to these corporations, but to return all such letters to the sender with the word 'Fraudulent' plainly stamped on the envelop. Rev. Stat. &#167;&#167; 3929, 4041, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 2686, 2749.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Degge, the corporations, and some of the stockholders, thereafter filed petitions in the supreme court of the District of Columbia, alleging that the officer before whom the hearing had been had was without power to make report on which the Postmaster General had acted; that there was no testimony to show the existence of a fraudulent scheme, and no evidence whatever to support the finding. It was alleged that the order was arbitrary, in excess of the power of the Postmaster General, and void. The petitioners prayed that the court would issue writs of certiorari directing the Postmaster General to certify the record to the court, and that upon hearing and review thereof the court would set aside the order. A rule to show cause was granted. The Postmaster General demurred on the ground that the court was without jurisdiction to issue the writ, and subject thereto answered, attaching the record and the evidence on the hearing before the officer of the Postoffice Department having charge of the Fraud Orders investigations.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was heard by the supreme court of the District of Columbia on petition, demurrer, and answer. After a hearing the court dismissed the case. The court of appeals of the District, without passing on the right to issue the writ, affirmed the judgment upon the ground that the evidence supported the order. The petitioners appealed, and on the argument in this court, the government renews the contention that the district court was without jurisdiction to issue the writ of certiorari to the Postmaster General.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Messrs.
