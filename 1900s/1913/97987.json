By the laws of the State of Washington, in which the property is situated, it became community property unless the statutes of the United States forbid. <i>Teynor</i> v. <i>Heible,</i> 133 Pac. Rep. 1. On that point we follow the Washington decisions. There was a demurrer, which was sustained by the District Court; <i>sub nom. </i><i>Buchser</i> v. <i>Morss,</i> 196 Fed.

The only semblance of difficulty is due to the coincidence in time of the acquisition of a separate right by the settler and the beginning of a community right in the wife. But this is by no means an extreme illustration of the division of an indivisible instant that is practiced by the law whenever it is necessary. A statute may give a man a right of action against another for causing his death, that accrues to him at the instant that he is <i>vivus et mortuus. </i><i>Higgins</i> v. <i>Central New England &amp; Western R.R.

In the present case the acquisition under the United States law is complete and that law has released its control before the state law lays hold, and, upon grounds in no way connected or interfering with the policy of Congress, brings the community regime into play.
