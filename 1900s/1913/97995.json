The plaintiff is the representative of one of Kener's heirs. The facts are these.

In the same year this land was set aside in due form to Kener as his homestead exempted by the state constitution of 1868 and the Bankruptcy Act then in force. Rev. Sts., \u00a7 5045. In June, 1879, he died and in December, 1879, the execution was levied and this land was sold. The sale was valid unless the Bankruptcy Act interfered.
