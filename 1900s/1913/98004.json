JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>The Sturges and Burn Manufacturing Company is a corporation engaged in manufacturing tinware and other metal products. It employed Arthur Beauchamp, the defendant in error, who was under sixteen years of age, as a press hand to operate a punch press used in stamping sheet metal. Beauchamp was injured in operating the press and brought an action through his next friend, in the Superior Court of Cook County, to recover the damages sustained, counting on the statute of Illinois passed in 1903 (Laws of 1903, p. 187, Hurd's Statutes, 1909, p. 1082) which, by \u00a7 11, prohibited the employment of children under the age of sixteen years in various hazardous occupations including that in which the injury occurred. The trial court, refusing to direct a verdict for the defendant, instructed the jury that if the plaintiff was in fact less than sixteen years old and when injured <span class=\"star-pagination\">*325</span> was employed by the defendant upon a stamping machine, the defendant was guilty of a violation of the statute and the plaintiff was entitled to recover.

It cannot be doubted that the State was entitled to prohibit the employment of persons of tender years in dangerous occupations. <i>Holden</i> v. <i>Hardy,</i> 169 U.S. 366, 392, 395; <i>Jacobson</i> v. <i>Massachusetts,</i> 197 U.S. 11, 31; <i>Muller</i> v. <i>Oregon,</i> 208 U.S. 412, 421; <i>Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy R.R.

It is said that, being over fourteen, he at least had attained the age at which he should have been treated as responsible for his statements.
