The action arose prior to the adoption of the Judicial Code, and was on two promissory notes, each for $1,000 and each providing for the payment of a reasonable attorney's fee if suit were brought. Could such an attorney's fee be considered in determining whether the jurisdictional amount was involved? We think so. Clearly such fee was no part of the costs, nor was it interest. It may be that the agreement to pay an attorney's fee in the event of suit created only an accessory right (though under Brown v. Webster, 156 U. S. 328, 39 L. ed. 440, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 377, this is doubtful), but nevertheless it gave a right to recover and created a legal obligation to pay. It is true its effectiveness was dependent upon suit being brought, yet the moment suit was brought the liability to pay the fee became a 'matter in controversy,' and as such to be computed in making up the requisite jurisdictional amount. Ibid., and this has been the rule since applied by lower Federal courts. Rogers v. Riley, 80 Fed. 759; Continental Casualty Co. v. Spradlin, 95 C. C. A. 112, 170 Fed. 322; Howard v.
