Acts 1909, subd. 3, \u00a7 10.)</p>\n<p>The injuries complained of, were caused by the negligence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> of a chauffeur in operating an automobile owned by the defendant company, resulting in a collision on the highway with plaintiff's horses and the cart in which he with two others were riding. Although the driver of the automobile was in the employ of the defendant company as a car tester and chauffeur, he was not at the time of the accident (about midnight) engaged in the company's business, but had taken the car without the knowledge or consent of the company and in violation of its rules for the purpose of pleasure-riding with his friends.

We say this because while it is undoubtedly our duty to decide for ourselves whether the statute is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, we must accept the ruling of the state court as to the repugnancy of the statute to the state constitution.

But it is to be observed that as to that ruling the court in the <i>Daugherty Case</i> declared that the statement as to the constitutionality of the statute made in the <i>Johnson Case</i> was merely <i>obiter.</i> Even however, if this were not the case, we cannot now treat as existing, a statute which the court of last resort of the State declares cannot be enforced compatibly with the state constitution. And as here there is no claim of rights acquired under contract in the light of a settled rule of state interpretation of a state law or constitution, there is no foundation whatever for upholding assumed rights which can alone rest upon the existence of a state statute when the state court of last resort has held there is no valid statute to sustain them.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n</div>",
