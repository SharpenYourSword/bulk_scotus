S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3155], as amended by the act of June 18, 1910, chap. 309, 36 Stat. at L. 547, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1288. After full hearing the Commission entered an order granting in certain respects the relief prayed, but establishing a proportionate relation to be maintained between the lower rate for the longer haul and the higher rate for the shorter haul upon the basis of percentages which were fixed with reference to defined zones. The carriers refused to obey the order, and filed their bill in the commerce court to enjoin its enforcement. An interlocutory injunction was ordered. The defendants moved to dismiss, and, on the overruling of the motions, appealed from the interlocutory order, that case being No. 137. Subsequently, upon the election of the defendants not to plead further, a final decree was entered and appealed from, that appeal being No. 163.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These cases are governed by the opinion in Nos. 136 and 162, just decided [234 U.
