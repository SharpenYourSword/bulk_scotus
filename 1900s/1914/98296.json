The claim was based on the Oklahoma statute which provides for a gross revenue tax; and was resisted upon the ground (among others) that in reality the demand was for an occupation or privilege tax to which the appellant could not lawfully be subjected, because, as a Federal instrumentality acting under Congressional authority, it had leased and was operating mines to which the Indians held title.

Its very language imposes a 'gross revenue tax which shall be in addition to the taxes levied and collected upon an ad valorem basis.' We cannot, therefore, conclude that the gross receipts were intended merely to represent the measure of the value of property liable to a general assessment&#8212;provision is made for determining that upon a different basis.

But it is insisted that the statute rightly understood prescribed only an <i>ad valorem</i> imposition on the personal property owned by appellant  the coal at the pit's mouth,  which is permissible according to many opinions of this court. <i>Thomson</i> v. <i>Pacific Railroad,</i> 9 Wall. 579; <i>Union Pacific Railroad</i> v. <i>Peniston,</i> 18 Wall. 5; <i>Central Pacific Railroad</i> v. <i>California,</i> 162 U.S. 91; <i>Thomas</i> v. <i>Gay,</i> 169 U.S. 264.</p>\n<p>The court below held that the effect of the act was to lay a valid tax on personalty, and the same result was subsequently reached by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma. <i>McAlester-Edwards Coal Co.</i> v. <i>Trapp,</i> 38 Oklahoma, 792, 794. The United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma arrived at a different conclusion. <i>Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Ry.</i> v. <i>Meyer,</i> 204 Fed. Rep. 140.</p>\n<p>Neither state courts nor legislatures by giving a tax a particular name, or by the use of some form of words, can take away our duty to consider its real nature and effect. <i>Galveston, Harrisburg &amp; San Antonio Ry.</i> v. <i>Texas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96864\"><a href=\"/opinion/96864/galveston-h-sar-co-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span>, 227.</p>\n<p>It is unnecessary to consider the power of the State of Oklahoma to treat coals dug from mines operated by the appellant as other personalty and to subject them to a uniform <i>ad valorem</i> tax, for it seems to us clear that the act of 1908 provided for no such imposition. Its very <span class=\"star-pagination\">*299</span> language imposes a \"gross revenue tax which shall be in addition to the taxes levied and collected upon an <i>ad valorem</i> basis.\" We cannot, therefore, conclude that the gross receipts were intended merely to represent the measure of the value of property liable to a general assessment  provision is made for determining that upon a different basis. <i>Oklahoma</i> v. <i>Wells, Fargo &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97551\"><a href=\"/opinion/97551/meyer-v-wells-fargo-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span>, 301. The requirement is not on account of property owned on a given day, as is the general custom where <i>ad valorem</i> taxes are provided for and as the Oklahoma laws require; but the manifest purpose is to reach all sales and secure a certain percentage thereof  a method commonly pursued in respect of license and occupation taxes. <i>Pullman Co.</i> v. <i>Knott, ante,</i> p. 23.</p>\n<p>A tax upon a merchant's, manufacturer's, or miner's gross sales is not the same thing as one on his stock treated as property. Cooley on Taxation (3rd ed.), p. 1095. The former is upon his business. In effect, the Oklahoma Act prescribes an occupation tax (<i>Ohio Tax Cases,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98114\"><a href=\"/opinion/98114/ohio-tax-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span>, 592); and, accepting as true the allegations of appellant's bill, we think it cannot lawfully be subjected thereto. The decree of the court below is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 98296, "judges": "McReynolds", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/98296/", "sha1": "d3fb6d1aef76060385264910bd87d2a8c7a0b590", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:43:21"}
