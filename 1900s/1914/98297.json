On June 3, 1910, it gave promissory notes to sundry creditors aggregating more than twenty-five thousand dollars; the same day the holders took judgments thereon by confession in the Superior Court of Cook County; executions were taken out at once and delivered to the sheriff for service, but no levy was ever made.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*304</span> June 4, 1910, a petition in involuntary bankruptcy was filed against the Company; a Receiver immediately appointed took possession of its property; and an adjudication of bankruptcy followed, June 17th.

This conclusion harmonizes with the purpose and history of the statute, and we think is correct. The lien claimed by appellant, as against judgment creditors, therefore, did not continue after the 5th day of October, 1909, and the attempt further to extend it was ineffective. Cook v. Thayer, 11 Ill. 617; Porter v. Dement, 35 Ill. 478, 480; Silvis v. Aultman, 141 Ill. 632, 31 N. E. 11; Re New York Economical Printing Co. 49 C. C. A. 133, 110 Fed. 514; Jones, Chat. Mortg. 5th ed. p. 287.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no adequate proof that the judgments against the bankrupt were fraudulently obtained. The referee found the executions were delivered to the sheriff for <i>service;</i> and appellant maintains this conclusively shows they were not 'delivered to the sheriff or other proper officer <i>to be executed</i>,' as required by statutute,&#8212;that 'service' does not include 'levy.' The record discloses no instruction to the officer to refrain from carrying out the mandate of the writs, nor are there facts which clearly indicate a conditional delivery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circuit court of appeals decided that, under the circumstances of the present case, the word 'service' must be taken to include levy, saying: 'In Peck v. City Nat. Bank, 51 Mich. 353, 47 Am. Rep. 577, 16 N. W. 681, it is said: 'Service of an execution includes every act and proceeding necessary to be taken by the sheriff to make the money, and includes the sale of the property when necessary.' The word has been defined to mean 'execution of process.' 35 Cyc. 1432. This construction seems to us reasonable in the case before us. It would be placing a strained meaning upon the transaction to hold that when a party places an execution in the hands of a process officer, the latter is not charged with the duty, without further instructions, to proceed to make the money called for by the writ, which itself commands him to do so. In the absence of directions not to levy, it is the duty of the officer to obey the directions and commands of the writ.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are of opinion that the courts below properly interpreted the finding of the referee, and that the execution creditors secured valid prior liens upon the bankrupt's property.
