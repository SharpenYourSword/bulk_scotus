On such appeal the Automobile Supply Company furnished the clerk of the court below a complete printed record accompanied with a written index of the contents of the same and in consequence of a demand made by the clerk deposited under protest the sum of $696.00 as a fee <span class=\"star-pagination\">*387</span> due the clerk for supervising the printed record so furnished. When after a hearing the court reversed the decree of the trial court, the Automobile Supply Company called upon the clerk either to refund the money charged for supervision or to include it in his statement of the costs to be entered on the mandate. The clerk, being doubtful as to his duty in the matter, refused to do either and insisted that the propriety of the charge be tested to the end that he might act advisedly in the premises. The Automobile Supply Company thereupon moved to direct the clerk to include the supervision fee in the mandate or to refund the amount of the deposit which had been made. The court held that the charge for supervision was lawful and was therefore properly taxable as costs and directed the clerk to retain the money and include a charge for the same in the mandate.

Grace Co.,</i> 231 U.S. 703, it was held that the provisions of the act were applicable to the Circuit Courts of Appeals and it was consequently decided that where a printed transcript of the record was filed in compliance with the statute with the clerk of the Court of Appeals no supervision fee could be charged by such clerk. Of course, if that ruling is here applicable, the court below clearly erred in allowing the charge for supervision, and the only possible question therefore is whether the statute, although generally applicable to records filed in the Circuit Court of Appeals, is not so applicable in this case. It is insisted that it is not \u0097 and the court below so held \u0097 because as the statute only provides for an appeal from a \"final judgment or decree,\" it does not apply to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*388</span> a case like the one under consideration where the appeal was from a decree interlocutory in character.

We so conclude because, while in a technical sense the decree here in question was interlocutory, when its character and the scope of the subject-matter which the appeal brought under review and the relief under it which it was competent to afford are considered, we are of opinion it must follow that such decree was within the intendment of this statute a final decree and therefore that error was committed in permitting the supervision charge. Indeed, this view was taken in a well considered opinion by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in a case decided before the ruling in the <i>Rainey Case, supra</i> (<i>Smith</i> v. <i>Farbenfabriken of Elberfeld Co.,</i> 197 Fed.
