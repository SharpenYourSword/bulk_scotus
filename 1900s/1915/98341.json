Solander, and her sister, Phoebe Trusler, surviving. Hettie L. Solander died intestate on December 19, 1899,<sup>[1]</sup> without husband or issue; her father and aunt (above mentioned) survived her. Minnie Solander was duly enrolled as a member of the Creek tribe and, after the death of herself and her daughter, an allotment was made to her `heirs' of certain land, the title to which is here in controversy. Her husband, George Solander, on April 27, 1906, executed a conveyance of this land to William M. Fewell, who brought the present action in ejectment against the plaintiff in error, John H. Shellenbarger; the latter claimed the property under a deed from Phoebe Trusler, the nearest relative of Indian blood.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of the State of Oklahoma held that the husband, although a non-citizen, had title to the lands allotted on behalf of his wife and that they passed under his conveyance. 34 Oklahoma, 79; 124 Pac.

This has also been assumed in the argument here. The case is, therefore, controlled by \u00a7 28 of the act of 1901, <i>supra,</i> which provides that the lands to which the deceased member of the tribe would have been entitled, if living, should `descend to his heirs according to the laws of descent and distribution of the Creek Nation, and be allotted . . . accordingly.'
