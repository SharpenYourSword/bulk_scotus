A commission thereafter appointed to ascertain the most humane and practical method of inflicting the death sentence reported in favor of electrocution. This was adopted by the statute of 1888 and, with the approval of the courts, has been in continuous use since that time. <i>In re Kemmler,</i> 136 U.S. 436; <i>People ex rel. Kemmler</i> v. <i>Durston,</i> 119 N.Y. 569.</p>\n<p>Influenced by the results in New York eleven other States<sup>[1a]</sup> have adopted the same mode for inflicting death in capital cases; and, as is commonly known, this result is the consequent of a well-grounded belief that electrocution is less painful and more humane than hanging. <i>Storti</i> v. <i>Commonwealth,</i> 178 Massachusetts, 549, 553; <i>State</i> v. <i>Tomassi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96079\"><a href=\"/opinion/96079/united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.L.</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span>, 747.</p>\n<p>The statute under consideration did not change the penalty  death  for murder, but only the mode of producing this together with certain non-essential details in respect of surroundings. The punishment was not increased and some of the odious features incident to the old method were abated.</p>\n<p>In <i>Hartung</i> v. <i>People, supra</i><i>,</i> the court had under consideration and condemned an act of the legislature which made a distinct addition to the penalty prescribed when the crime was committed; and the conclusion therein is not properly applicable in the circumstances of the present cause where there has been no such change.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the court below is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]   AN ACT TO PRESCRIBE THE METHOD OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN SOUTH CAROLINA.\n</p>\n<p>SEC. 1.
