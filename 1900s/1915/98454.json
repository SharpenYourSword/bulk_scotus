To meet this the defendant offered to prove that Harvey C. Miller owned 93.6 per cent of the plaintiff's stock; that he also was a member of the firm of L. F. Miller &amp; Sons, for which 90 per cent of the plaintiff's business now in question was done; that the grain handled came from other states over the defendant's lines; that competitors of L. F. Miller &amp; Sons received grain from the same point at the same rate, but did not have any elevator, perform any elevator service, or receive compensation for such service; that the plaintiff's books showed that the plaintiff and Harvey C. Miller had received from the payments already made by the defendant and consignees the actual cost of the services rendered, with a reasonable profit, the defendant contending that further payment would be contrary to the act to regulate commerce; and finally an opinion and order of the Interstate Commerce Commission of later date than the service rendered and the bringing of this suit.
