The works of the Tennessee Company, much the larger of the two, are situated within half a mile of the line; those of the Ducktown Company are some 2 1/2 miles away. The ores contain a very large amount of sulphur, around 20 per cent,&#8212;and in the process of smelting great quantities of sulphur dioxid are formed; if allowed to escape into the air this becomes sulphurous acid, a poisonous gas destructive of plant life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October, 1905, the state of Georgia began this original proceeding, alleging that defendants permitted discharge from their works of noxious gases which, being carried by air currents, ultimately settled upon its territory and destroyed the vegetation, and asking for appropriate relief. The case was heard on the merits and the issues determined in complainant's favor, May, 1907. We then said: 'If the state of Georgia adheres to its determination, there is no alternative to issuing an injunction, after allowing a reasonable time to the defendants to complete the structures that they now are building, and the efforts that they are making, to stop the fumes. The plaintiff may submit a form of decree on the coming in of this court in October next.' 206 U. S. 230, 239, 51 L. ed. 1038, 1045, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 618, 11 Ann.

Both companies installed purifying devices. The Tennessee Company and the state finally entered into a stipulation whereby the former undertook annually to supply a fund to compensate those injured by fumes from its works, to conduct its plant subject to inspection in specified ways, and between April 10th and October 1st not to 'operate more green ore furnaces than it finds necessary to permit of operating its sulphuric acid plant at its normal full capacity.' The state agreed to refrain from asking an injunction prior to October, 1916, if the stipulation was fully observed. The Ducktown Company and the state were unable to agree, and in February, 1914, the latter moved for a decree according a perpetual injunction. Consideration of the matter was postponed upon representation that conditions had materially changed since 1907, and leave was granted to present additional testimony 'to relate solely to the changed conditions, if any, which may have arisen since the case was here decided.'

Similar improvements have been installed by the Tennessee Company at great expense, but we are without adequate information concerning the effect produced by them.

The sulphur in the fumes generated in connection with the production for this month, not redeemed by the acid plant and emitted into the air, may be fairly estimated as not less than 7 per cent of 13,102, or 917 tons,&#8212;substantially 30 tons per day.
