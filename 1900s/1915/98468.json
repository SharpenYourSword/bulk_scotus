Because of the failure of the lieu entrymen to file in time the relinquishment made by the State of Oregon and the assumed resulting priority of the rights of the other entrymen over those of the lieu entrymen.

In addition various propositions are urged concerning the bad faith of Daniels in buying the right to the land from the State and the assumption, based upon this premise, of his want of right to the relinquishment or to use it in order to clear away the supposed impediment on the land record to the allowance of the lieu entries. But even assuming for the sake of argument that the premise of fact upon which this contention proceeded had any real relevancy to the right of the lieu entrymen to acquire the land and to use the relinquishment to enable them to do so, such premise is devoid of merit because of the express finding of the Secretary of the Interior which we have stated in the opinion in No. 239 that Daniels' good faith in the Oregon transaction was established.
