Recognizing that this is so, counsel for the plaintiff in his brief not only frankly concedes that he finds no statute in point, but endeavors to maintain the jurisdiction of the District Court by a reference to the general powers of Federal courts when sitting as courts of equity, evidently forgetting that such powers can be exerted only in cases otherwise within the jurisdiction of those courts as defined by Congress.</p>\n<p>Some stress is laid in the brief upon portions of the bill charging fraud in the procurement of the Eppler patent, but as only the United States can maintain a bill to annul the patent on that ground (<i>Mowry</i> v. <i>Whitney,</i> 14 Wall. 434; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Bell Telephone Co.,</i> 128 U.S. 315, 368; <i>United States</i> v. <i>American Bell Telephone Co.,</i> 159 U.S. 548, 555) these allegations cannot affect the solution of the question of jurisdiction here presented.</p>\n<p>Our conclusion is that this is not a suit arising under the patent laws.</p>\n<p><i>Decree affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  See \u00a7 9, act February 9, 1893, c. 74, 27 Stat. 434.</p>\n\n</div>",
