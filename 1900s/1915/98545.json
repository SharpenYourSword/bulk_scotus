The trial court refused a request to charge that he was not engaged in interstate commerce when the accident occurred, and therefore could not recover.

There was evidence tending to show that, in order to complete this movement, it became necessary to uncouple the engine from the loaded cars and with it to remove two empty ones from the private track. While engaged about the removal, defendant in error was injured. The trial court submitted to the jury for determination whether he was engaged in interstate commerce at the time of the injury, and in approving such action (224 Fed. 1021) the circuit court of appeals was clearly right.
