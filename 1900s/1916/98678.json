The defendant opposed the request on the ground that there was doubt as to the possibility of adequately reducing the testimony, and on the further ground that it desired the testimony brought up in original shape, and because, under all the circumstances of the case, it should not be governed by equity rule 75. The court declined to pass upon the application, but suggested that the parties submit to this court the question whether equity rule 75 was, under the circumstances, imperatively applicable, stating, however, that it had found great advantage in disposing of the case from having the original testimony before it, and was of the opinion that a like advantage would be experienced by this court if the original testimony was brought up.

By agreement between the parties, as the testimony was taken it was printed and bound, and the requisite number of copies of the volumes are on hand to serve as part of the record in this court on the appeal.

While this is true, however, in order that there may be ample opportunity to file the record made up conformably to the views which we have just stated, the time for filing the record, which was extended by this court on March 15th, pending this application, will be now extended sixty days from that date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And it is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>240 U.S. 442 (1916)</b></center>\n<center><h1>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA<br>\nv.<br>\nUNITED STATES STEEL CORPORATION.</h1></center>\n<center>No. ___.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Application submitted March 14, 1916.</center>\n<center>Decided March 20, 1916.</center>\nAPPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY.\n<p><i>Mr. Assistant to the Attorney General Todd</i> and <i>The Solicitor General</i> for the United States.</p>\n<p><i>Mr. Richard V.
