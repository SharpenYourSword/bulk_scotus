I. &amp; P. R. Co. v. Arkansas, 219 U. S. 453, 55 L. ed. 290, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 275, a statute of Arkansas was considered which required freight trains to be equipped with crews consisting of an engineer, a foreman, a conductor, and three brakemen, 'regardless of any modern equipment or automatic couplings and air brakes. . . .' The statute did not apply to railroads whose line or lines did not exceed 50 miles in length, nor to any railroad, regardless of length of its line, where the freight train should consist of less than twenty-five cars. The statute was sustained on the authority of prior cases against charges of conflict with the 14th Amendment and the commerce clause of the Constitution. We need not cite the cases relied on or repeat the argument of the court. In that case, as in this, there was controversy in the testimony and the contentions of the parties as to the necessity of the statute. It was held, however, that the controversy did not establish that the statute was an arbitrary exercise of power. Armour &amp; Co. v. North Dakota, this day decided [240 U.

The distinction seems arbitrary if we regard only its letter, but there may have been considerations which determined it, and the record does not show the contrary.
