Petition in error was filed and the case taken to the court of appeals, wherein it was heard upon the record, and the judgment of the superior court of Cincinnati was affirmed. After a general judgment of affirmance, the court of appeals ordered 'that a special mandate by sent to the superior court of Cincinnati to carry this judgment into execution.'

A writ of error was allowed and issued, running to the superior court of Cincinnati, reciting that it was the highest court of record in the state in which a decision in the cause could be had.

Section 12,247 provides that 'a judgment rendered or final order made by a court of common pleas or by the superior court of Cincinnati, or by a judge of either of such courts, may be reversed, vacated or modified, by the court of appeals having jurisdiction in the county wherein the common pleas or superior court is located, for errors appearing on the record.'
