The sixth count charges the defendant, as clerk, with a like conversion. A demurrer to the indictment was sustained and the United States brings the case here. The judge assumed that the costs referred to in the several counts were fees of the clerk and, we presume, in case of proceedings in bankruptcy, fees collected for the referee and trustee, and also that the funds were funds to be accounted for by the clerk as debtor, not as trustee, under the decision in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Mason,</i> 218 U.S. 517, 531. He therefore was of opinion that the money was not within the purview of \u00a7 99 of the Penal Code, punishing the embezzlement of money belonging in the registry of the court, etc. The same reasoning led him to the conclusion that \u00a7 97 did not apply and it is the latter proposition that the United States seeks to have revised.</p>\n<p>The judge objected that the charges in the indictment did not follow the language of \u00a7 97, but as he went on to consider whether the statute applied to the facts alleged we shall deal with the latter question.
