The accident occurred July 27, 1912, when, as member of a switching crew, he was assisting in placing three cars containing supply coal for plaintiff in error on an unloading trestle within its yards at Cortland, New York. These cars belonged to it, and with their contents had passed over its line from Sayre, Pennsylvania.
