The guaranty company, conceiving that it had a partial equitable defense, not admissible at law, which was common to all the cases, and other partial defenses in particular cases, exhibited in that court a bill describing the actions at law, setting forth the defenses, showing that nothing was in controversy beyond the defenses, and praying that the entire matter be examined and adjudicated in a single proceeding in equity and further proceedings at law enjoined. Although showing that the parties were citizens of different States, the bill was framed as a dependent and ancillary bill and the court was asked to entertain it as such in virtue of the jurisdiction already acquired. The court did entertain it and ultimately sustained the equitable defense, partly sustained some <span class=\"star-pagination\">*104</span> of the others, ascertained the amount of the liability of the guaranty company upon the claims set forth in the actions at law, and ordered that this amount, with interest, be paid in satisfaction of those claims. The Circuit Court of Appeals made a small reduction in the amount of the company's liability, made provision for subrogating the company to the rights of Mrs. Eichel against a bankrupt's estate in process of administration, and affirmed the decree as so modified. 241 Fed. Rep. 357.</p>\n<p>Plainly the bill was dependent and ancillary and the jurisdiction to entertain it was referable to that invoked and existing in the actions at law out of which it arose. <i>Jones</i> v. <i>Andrews,</i> 10 Wall. 327, 333; <i>Dewey</i> v. <i>West Fairmont Gas Coal Co.,</i> 123 U.S. 329, 333; <i>Minnesota Co.</i> v. <i>St. Paul Co.,</i> 2 Wall. 609, 633; <i>Krippendorf</i> v. <i>Hyde,</i> 110 U.S. 276, 281; <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>Christian,</i> 125 U.S. 642, 645; <i>Carey</i> v. <i>Houston &amp; Texas Central Ry.
