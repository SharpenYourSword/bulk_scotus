He sued out a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> from the State Supreme Court and sought discharge upon the ground that those sections were in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment, Federal Constitution, and therefore void. The court held: \"The only means provided by the act for procuring intoxicating liquors in a prohibition district for any purpose relates to wine to be used for sacramental purposes and pure alcohol to be used for scientific or mechanical purposes, or for compounding or preparing medicine, so that the possession of whiskey, or of any intoxicating liquor, other than wine and pure alcohol for the uses above mentioned, is prohibited.\" And further, \"we have reached the conclusion that this act is not in contravention of Section one of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States . . .; that it was passed by the legislature with a view to the protection of the public health, the public morals and the public safety; that it has a real and substantial relation to those objects and that it is, therefore, a reasonable exercise of the police power of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*307</span> State.\" (<i>In re Ed.
