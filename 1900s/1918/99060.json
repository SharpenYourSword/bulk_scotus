There is no controversy as to the facts, and it appears that the Lake Superior Chippewas by treaty of October 4, 1842, proclaimed March 23, 1843, 7 Stat. 591, ceded large tracts of land in Wisconsin and Michigan to the United States, reserving the right of hunting to the ceded territory, and other usual privileges of occupancy until removed by the President. Within the Wisconsin territory were included the sections 16 in question, lying in township 46 north, ranges 2 and 3 west, and township 47 north, in range 2 west.</p>\n<p>Wisconsin was admitted to the Union in 1848. The enabling act contained the provision as to the school sections recited in <i>Wisconsin</i> v. <i>Lane</i><i>,</i> just decided, <i>ante,</i> 427. The President did not remove the Indians, and on September 30, 1854, a treaty was made with them, proclaimed January 29, 1855, 10 Stat. 1109, whereby the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*438</span> United States set apart the LaPointe Reservation in Wisconsin, and provided for surveys and allotments in severalty from time to time of such reserved lands in the discretion of the President.</p>\n<p>This reservation embraces the land in controversy, nothing was said in the treaty about sections numbered sixteen. The qectional survey, identifying sections 16, as to one of the townships was made in 1864, as to the other two in 1873.

The patents in each case contained a provision that the allottee and his heirs shall not sell, lease or in any manner alienate the lands except with the consent of the President. From 1909 to 1912 timber on the lands in dispute, which had been damaged by fire, was cut for sale by the Lumber Company under stipulation made with approval of the United States, and the value of the lumber so realized was deposited in banks for the benefit of the parties entitled thereto, the amount so deposited being $66,833.56.</p>\n<p>This case does not need extended discussion as in our opinion it is controlled by the decision of this court just rendered in <i>Wisconsin</i> v. <i>Lane</i><i>, ante,</i> 427. The treaty of 1854 authorized the ultimate allotment in severalty to the Indians of the lands reserved by it. Afterwards such allotment of the sections in question was made by the President of the United States in carrying out the purposes of the treaty. Considering the obligations of the United States in favor of its Indian wards imposed by this treaty, and the purpose for which these lands were <span class=\"star-pagination\">*439</span> reserved, we are of opinion that the treaty with these provisions in favor of the Indians amounts to a disposition of the lands within the authority of Congress, and is not inconsistent with the enabling act under which the school lands were provided for the State.</p>\n<p>Considering that the lands were reserved by the treaty long before they were surveyed and the sections identified, the fact that they were after survey allotted in severalty to the Indians does not in our view enable the State to claim the sixteenth sections under the school lands grant.
