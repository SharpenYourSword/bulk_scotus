The proposition disregards the plain text of the Sixth Amendment, the contemporary construction placed upon it by the Judiciary Act of 1789 (c. 20, 1 Stat. 73, 88, \u00a7 29), expressly authorizing the drawing of a jury from a part of the district, and the continuous legislative and judicial practice from the beginning. Section 802, Rev. Stats.; \u00a7 277, Judicial Code. <i>Agnew</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 165 U.S. 36, 43; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Wan Lee,</i> 44 Fed.

But this overlooks the fact that although only the persons described were subject to military duty under the terms of the act, by \u00a7 5 \"all male persons between the ages of twenty-one and thirty, both inclusive\" (with certain exceptions not here material), were required to register. It was sufficient to charge, therefore, as the indictment did, that Schue was a male person between the designated ages.</p>\n<p>The contention that more than one offense was charged in the same indictment is without merit. Section 332 of the Criminal Code provides that \"Whoever directly commits any act constituting an offense defined in any law of the United States, or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures its commission, is a principal.\" The indictment, therefore, charged but one offense \u0097 the refusal of Schue to register \u0097 plaintiffs in error being charged as principals in procuring such refusal.
