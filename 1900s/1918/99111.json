Section 19 of that act declares:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'That if at any election for representative or delegate in      the Congress of the United States any person shall knowingly      * * * by force, threat, menace, intimidation, bribery,      reward, or offer, or promise thereof, or otherwise unlawfully      prevent any qualified voter of any state of the United States      of America or of any territory thereof, from freely      exercising the right of suffrage, * * * or compel or induce      by any such means, or otherwise, any officer of an election      in any such state or territory to receive a vote from a      person not legally qualified or entitled to vote, * * * or      aid, counsel, procure, or advise any such voter, person, or      officer to do any act hereby made a crime, * * * every such      person shall be deemed guilty of a crime, and shall for such      crime be liable to prosecution in any court of the United      States of competent jurisdiction, and, on conviction thereof,      shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred      dollars, or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding three      years, or both, in the discretion of the court, and shall pay      the costs of prosecution.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In pursuance of a well understood policy, the Act of February 8, 1894, c. 25, 28 Stats. 36, repealed the foregoing and other kindred sections in Act of 1870 but left in effect section 6, then section 5508, Revised Statutes, and now section 19, Criminal Code (Act March 4, 1909, c. 321, 35 Stat. 1092 [Comp. St. 1916, &#167; 10183]). See United States v. Mosley, 238 U. S. 383, 35 Sup. Ct. 904, 59 L. Ed. 1355; United States v. Gradwell, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government in effect maintains that lawful voters at an election for presidential electors, senator and member of Congress and also the candidates for those places have secured to them by Constitution or laws of the United States the right and privilege that it shall be fairly and honestly conducted; and that Congress intended by section 6, Act of 1870, to punish interference with such right and privilege through conspiracy to influence voters by bribery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 19, Criminal Code (Comp.

St. 1916, &#167;&#167; 10513, 10515]); and considering the policy of Congress not to interfere with elections within a state except by clear and specific provisions, together with the rule respecting const uction of criminal statutes, we cannot think it was intended to apply to conspiracies to bribe voters. Bribery, expressly denounced in another section of the original act, is not clearly within the words used; and the reasoning relied on to extend them thereto would apply in respect of almost any act reprehensible in itself, or forbidden by state statutes, and supposed injuriously to affect freedom, honesty, or integrity of an election. This conclusion is strengthened by express repeal of the section applicable in terms to bribery and we think is rendered entirely clear by considering the nature of the rights or privileges fairly within intendment of original section 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The right or privilege to be guarded, as indicated both by the language employed and context, was a definite, personal one, capable of enforcement by a court, and not the political, non-judicable one common to all that the public shall be protected against harmful acts, which is here relied on. The right to vote is personal and we have held it is shielded by the section in question. Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U. S. 651, 4 Sup. Ct. 152, 28 L. Ed. 274; United States v. Mosley, supra. The same is true of the right to make homestead entry, United States v. Waddell, 112 U. S. 76, 5 Sup. Ct. 35, 28 L. Ed. 673; also, of the right of one held by a United States marshal to protection against lawless violence, Logan v. United States, 144 U. S. 263, 12 Sup. Ct. 617, 36 L. Ed. 429. While the opinion in United States v.
