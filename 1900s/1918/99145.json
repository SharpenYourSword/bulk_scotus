Of course it is not the law that a railway      company may lay out a slow schedule over a long distance and      then if just before they get in to destination something happens for which they were not prepared or      equipped, merely because if that thing had not happened they      might have skinned in within the thirty-six limit they are      excused; that is not the law.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute must be construed with a view to carrying its humanitarian purpose into effect and the exception in favor of the carrier given proper latitude and enforced in the light of practical railroad conditions.

The definition of 'due diligence' in the charge was too exacting and misleading. As applied to the facts due diligence did not require, as the court declared, that 'whatever ingenuity, that is to say whatever human intelligence could devise and put in operation, having in mind the practical operation of a railroad, and having in mind the purpose which the law has, to get stock to market within the time mentioned, having in mind the movement of trains, the keeping of a railroad open, what human ingenuity could devise, in so far as human intelligence goes, having the benefit of experience, in the way of safeguards and in the way of provision to get stock from origin to destination within the period of this statutory limit, the railroad company has to do.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find nothing in the act indicating a purpose to interfere directly with the carrier's discretion in establishing schedules for trains; the design was to fix a limit beyond which animals must not be confined, whatever the schedule, except under the extraordinary circumstances stated.

If in the exercise of ordinary care prudence and foresight the carrier reasonably expects that following the determined schedule the containing car will reach destination or some unloading place within the prescribed time it properly may be put in transit. Thereafter the duty is on the carrier to exercise the diligence and foresight which prudent men, experienced in such matters, would adopt to prevent accidents and delays and to overcome the effect of any which may happen&#8212;with an honest purpose always to secure unloading within the lawful period.

It is still the duty of the carrier to do all reasonably within its power to limit the hours of service in accordance with the requirements of the law.\" This general principle should also be followed in construing and applying the provision of the statute here under consideration.</p>\n<p>The judgment below is reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed and remanded.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 99145, "judges": "McReynolds", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/99145/", "sha1": "5d78b3b0f591cc7a6dc9848aed651677430d3e07", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:46:48"}
