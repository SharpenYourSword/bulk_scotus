The charge was, as we have seen, that the defendants had opium in their possession in violation of the statute of the State.

It is in dispute whether they did or whether one McCoy, the custom house broker, received it and weighed it, assisted by Young. The weighing, it was testified, was made necessary by the requirement of the law of Mexico.

And he testified that McCoy weighed its contents. He was then asked the question if he knew why McCoy weighed the contents. The question was objected to as immaterial on the ground that it made no difference what the purpose of weighing the contents was. The objection was sustained and counsel for Young replied, 'We want to show that Mr. McCoy was to make out the American and Mexican papers for the expiration of the box to McGinis and Young at Mexicali.' The question was then put whether McGinis and Young had authority to export the opium that was seized. Again the attorney for the State objected, saying, 'It can have no bearing in this case. It is only a question of possession.' The objection was sustained, to which it was replied by defendants' attorney, 'If the court will not permit us to put in our defense as to having permission and authority to export the opium, cocaine and morphine mentioned in interstate and foreign commerce under the regulations of the Treasury Department of the United States, the defendants will rest.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A series of instructions were asked by defendants to be given which expressed the supremacy of Congress over interstate and foreign commerce and that therefore, even if defendants had control of the opium, if it was in transit or being transported from the United States to Mexico through a chain of carriers, then the defendants did not have possession of the opium in violation of the law of the State, and that it was the duty of the jury to acquit them.
