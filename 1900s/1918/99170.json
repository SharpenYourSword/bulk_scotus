The right of possession is immaterial now, but there was a judgment quieting the title of the plaintiff against the above named parties which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State and in which error is alleged by Lottie Carney. The land was allotted to John Alberson, a Chickasaw Indian, who was averred by the plaintiff to be the lawful son of Charles Puiler, a Chickasaw, and Louisa James, an Indian woman.
