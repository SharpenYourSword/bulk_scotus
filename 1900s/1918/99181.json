Trains operated over this portion of the line are under control of the Yard Master and subject to a rule which provides, \"all trains will reduce speed on passing through yard limits and proceed only after the way is seen or known to be clear.\" Each of these shanties was continuously operated night and day by two men, alternately on duty therein for twelve hours during every twenty-four.</p>\n<p>\"All of the work regularly and generally required of said employees, as well as that required on the days mentioned in said declaration, was in connection with the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*199</span> use of certain switches and telephones, which said work pertained to and affected the movements of trains of defendant engaged in interstate commerce.
