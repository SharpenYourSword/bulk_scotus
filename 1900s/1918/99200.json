Proceeding in entire good faith, an inexperienced local assessor adopted the valuation which his predecessor had placed upon the company's property \u0097 $65,000.00; the County Board of Review approved his action. Reviewing this in the light of a subsequent detailed report by experts appointed under a special act of the legislature passed in April, 1911, to appraise all mining properties, the State Board raised the assessment to $1,071,000.00; but, because of alleged lack of time and inadequate information, it declined to order a new and general survey of values or generally to increase other assessments, notwithstanding plaintiff in error represented and offered to present evidence showing that they amounted to no more than one-third of true market values.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is to secure every person within the State's jurisdiction against intentional and arbitrary discrimination, whether occasioned by express terms of a statute or by its improper execution through duly constituted agents. And it must be regarded as settled that intentional systematic undervaluation by state officials of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*353</span> other taxable property in the same class contravenes the constitutional right of one taxed upon the full value of his property. <i>Raymond</i> v. <i>Chicago Union Traction Co.,</i> 207 U.S. 20, 35, 37. It is also clear that mere errors of judgment by officials will not support a claim of discrimination. There must be something more \u0097 something which in effect amounts to an intentional violation of the essential principle of practical uniformity. The good faith of such officers and the validity of their actions are presumed; when assailed, the burden of proof is upon the complaining party. <i>Head Money Cases,</i> 112 U.S. 580, 595; <i>Pittsburgh &amp;c.
