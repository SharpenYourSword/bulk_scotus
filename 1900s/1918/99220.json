The plaintiffs got judgments which were affirmed by the Supreme Court of Michigan, 164 N. W. 528, and the cases are brought here upon lengthy assignments of error.

We are of opinion that the judgments should be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of the assignments of error concern questions of local law with which we cannot deal. Such are whether the order of the Commission were in force pending an injunction and before the defendant railroad had fixed rates in pursuance of a mandate of the State Court; whether the State laws permit an action to be maintained without an order of reparation by the Commission; and whether the statutes purport to make the order fixing the rates conclusive in the present suits. These questions depend upon the construction of the State laws, as to which, upon writs of error to the State Court that Court has the last word. Its power would not be diminished if similar provisions in an Act of Congress had been differently construed by this Court. The only question properly before us is whether the statutes as construed run against the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. It is argued that they do, if, as was held, they preclude an inquiry in these proceedings into the confiscatory character of the rates in present circumstances. But the defendant had had its chance to have the validity of the rates judicially determined in a suit for that purpose and had used it. Detroit &amp; Mackinac Ry. Co. v.
