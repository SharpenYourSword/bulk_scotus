Upon final hearing the District Court found the defendant liable for the application of a balance of the Savings Company's deposit in the National Bank, upon paper held by it on which the Savings Company appeared as principal maker, but which was found to have been given for the benefit of certain of the Savings Company's officers. Plaintiff's remaining claims were rejected. Both parties appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which reversed the decree of the District Court, upon the ground that the receiver had no authority to bring the suit (246 Fed. 753, 159 C.

Clark, 17 How. 322, 15 L. Ed. 164, it is the settled doctrine in federal jurisprudence that a chancery receiver has no authority to sue in the courts of a foreign jurisdiction to recover demands or property therein situated. The functions and authority of such receiver are confined to the jurisdiction in which he was appointed. The reasons for this rule were fully discussed in Booth v. Clark and have been reiterated in later decisions of this court. Hale v. Allinson, 188 U. S. 56, 23 Sup. Ct. 244, 47 L. Ed. 380; Great Western Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co. v. Harris, 198 U.

This practice has become general in the courts of the United States, and is a system well understood and followed. It permits an application for an ancillary receivership in a foreign jurisdiction where the local assets may be recovered and, if necessary, administered. The system established in Booth v. Clark has become the settled law of the federal courts, and, if the powers of chancery receivers are to be enlarged in such wise as to give them authority to sue beyond the jurisdiction of the appointing court, such extension of authority must come from legislation and not from judicial action.

Clark, and that under the Alabama statutes and the decisions of the Supreme Court of that state the title to the property of the Trust Company is vested in the receiver in such wise that he is authorized to sue for its recovery in the courts of a foreign jurisdiction. If this contention is well founded there is no question of the authority of the receiver to prosecute the action. Relfe v. Rundle, 103 U. S. 222, 26 L. Ed. 337; Hawkins v. Glenn, 131 U.

Proceedings when bank found not solvent.  Whenever the treasurer finds that a bank or corporation chartered by the laws of this state and doing a banking business, is not in a solvent condition, he shall immediately report the condition of the bank to the governor, and the governor shall direct the attorney-general to institute proceedings in a court having jurisdiction in the county where the bank or parent bank is located, to put the bank in the hands of some competent person, who shall give bond in an amount to be fixed by the judge for the faithful discharge of his duties, and said person so appointed shall immediately take charge of the business of said bank, collecting its assets and paying off its liabilities under the law and rules of such court.\"</p>\n<p>The question presented for our consideration is whether the receiver appointed in the chancery court is authorized to sue in the federal court for the recovery of such property.</p>\n<p>Since the decision of this court in <i>Booth</i> v. <i>Clark,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86932\"><a href=\"/opinion/86932/booth-v-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span>, it is the settled doctrine in federal jurisprudence that a chancery receiver has no authority to sue in the courts of a foreign jurisdiction to recover demands or property therein situated. The functions and authority of such receiver are confined to the jurisdiction in which <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> he was appointed. The reasons for this rule were fully discussed in <i>Booth</i> v. <i>Clark</i><i>,</i> and have been reiterated in later decisions of this court. <i>Hale</i> v. <i>Allinson,</i> 188 U.S. 56; <i>Great Western Mining Co.</i> v. <i>Harris,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96321\"><a href=\"/opinion/96321/great-western-mining-mfg-co-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span>, 575, 577; <i>Keatley</i> v. <i>Furey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97724\"><a href=\"/opinion/97724/keatley-v-furey/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span>, 403. This practice has become general in the courts of the United States, and is a system well understood and followed. It permits an application for an ancillary receivership in a foreign jurisdiction where the local assets may be recovered and, if necessary, administered. The system established in <i>Booth</i> v. <i>Clark</i> has become the settled law of the federal courts, and if the powers of chancery receivers are to be enlarged in such wise as to give them authority to sue beyond the jurisdiction of the appointing court, such extension of authority must come from legislation and not from judicial action. <i>Great Western Mining Co.</i> v. <i>Harris, supra,</i> p. 577.</p>\n<p>Counsel for petitioner insists that the case is not ruled by the doctrine of <i>Booth</i> v. <i>Clark</i><i>,</i> and that under the Alabama statutes and the decisions of the Supreme Court of that State the title to the property of the Trust Company is vested in the Receiver in such wise that he is authorized to sue for its recovery in the courts of a foreign jurisdiction. If this contention is well founded there is no question of the authority of the Receiver to prosecute the action. <i>Relfe</i> v. <i>Rundle,</i> 103 U.S. 222; <i>Hawkins</i> v. <i>Glenn,</i> 131 U.S. 319; <i>Bernheimer</i> v. <i>Converse,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96701\"><a href=\"/opinion/96701/bernheimer-v-converse/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span>, 534; <i>Converse</i> v. <i>Hamilton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97605\"><a href=\"/opinion/97605/converse-v-hamilton/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></a></span>, 257; <i>Keatley</i> v. <i>Furey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97724\"><a href=\"/opinion/97724/keatley-v-furey/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span>, 403.</p>\n<p>The Alabama cases, <i>Oates</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> 176 Alabama, 39; <i>Montgomery Bank &amp; Trust Co.</i> v. <i>Walker,</i> 181 Alabama, 368; <i>Cobbs</i> v. <i>Vizard Investment Co.,</i> 182 Alabama, 372; <i>Coffey</i> v. <i>Gay,</i> 191 Alabama, 137; <i>Hundley</i> v. <i>Hewitt,</i> 195 Alabama, 647, are fully reviewed in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals. To rehearse them now would be but a repetition of what is said in that opinion.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> An examination of the sections of the statutes, here involved, in the light of the decisions of the Supreme Court of Alabama, does not in our opinion warrant the conclusion that title is vested in the Receiver as assignee or as statutory successor of the insolvent corporation in such wise as to authorize the action to recover in a foreign jurisdiction. Collectively, these sections provide for a receivership to administer the property and assets of the insolvent corporation under the authority and direction of the appointing court. The statutes do not undertake to vest in the receiver an estate in the property to be administered for the benefit of creditors, as was the case in <i>Bernheimer</i> v. <i>Converse,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96701\"><a href=\"/opinion/96701/bernheimer-v-converse/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span>; <i>Converse</i> v. <i>Hamilton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97605\"><a href=\"/opinion/97605/converse-v-hamilton/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></a></span>, in which the right to sue in the courts of a foreign jurisdiction was sustained.</p>\n<p>The Circuit Court of Appeals left open the question of the right to apply for an ancillary receivership in the District Court, and the effect of such appointment, if made, upon the pending suit. We pursue the like course, and as such an application could only originate in the District Court we express no opinion concerning it. The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 99229, "judges": "Day", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/99229/", "sha1": "5c065f00efcadb6c2c6fd30d3060944c87836eec", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:46:50"}
