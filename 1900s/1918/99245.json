JUSTICE DAY delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>John Dillon, a British subject, filed a libel in admiralty in the United States District Court for the Northern <span class=\"star-pagination\">*183</span> District of Florida in which he claimed the sum of $125.00, alleged to be due him for wages as a carpenter on the steamship \"Strathearn.\" The District Court dismissed the libel. 239 Fed. Rep. 583. An appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The libel was filed under the provisions of \u00a7 4 of the Seaman's Act of 1915, 38 Stat. 1164, 1165.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The Circuit Court of Appeals certifies two questions to this court:</p>\n<p>\"First.

Rule 37 of this court provides that in such cases the certificate shall contain a proper statement of the facts on which the questions of law arise. The certificate in this case fails to comply with this rule of court. It contains a partial statement of Dillon's contract with the ship. It states that no part of the sum sued for was due under the shipping articles signed by Dillon. It does not state the terms of payment agreed upon, when or where payments were to be made under the contract, or what advancements, if any, were to be made during the voyage. The certificate concludes: \"For information as to the facts of the case copies of the transcript and briefs are herewith transmitted.\" Counsel argue the case by reference to the transcript of the record in the Circuit Court of Appeals, and it is apparent that a proper consideration of the case requires such reference. This transcript is no part of our record. This court alone has authority to have it sent up. The briefs in the Circuit Court of Appeals are no part of the record here. The certificate is required to state the pertinent facts in order that this court may answer the questions of law certified with reference to such facts, and not by searching the records and briefs of the Circuit Court of Appeals itself.</p>\n<p>The certificate therefore fails to comply with our rule, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*185</span> and in accordance with the established practice must be dismissed. <i>Cincinnati, Hamilton &amp; Dayton R.R.
