What the proper construction of the treaty is, is the only question argued in this court.</p>\n<p>The only provisions of the Act of September 6, 1916, applicable to the review of such a case as we have here are these:</p>\n<p>\"A final judgment . . . in the highest court of a State in which a decision in the suit could be had, where is drawn in question the <i>validity</i> of a treaty . . . of . . . the United States, and the decision is against their [its] validity . . . may be re-examined and reversed or affirmed in the Supreme Court upon a writ of error . . .</p>\n<p>\"It shall be competent for the Supreme Court, by certiorari or otherwise, to require that there be certified to it for review and determination . . . any cause wherein a final judgment or decree has been rendered or passed by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had . . . where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is claimed under . . . any treaty .. . and the decision is either in favor of or against the title, right, privilege, or immunity especially set up or claimed, by either party, under such . . . treaty . . .\"</p>\n<p>Since, as we have seen, the plaintiff in error has not assailed the validity of the Russian treaty but on the contrary has claimed under an asserted construction of it, which was denied, it is clear that the case cannot come into this court by writ of error, under the statute quoted.
