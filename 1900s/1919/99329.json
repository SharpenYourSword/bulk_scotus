CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE.</p>\n<p>The Manila Electric Railroad &amp; Light Company, the appellee, operated in the City of Manila a street railway and an electric light and power plant by virtue of a franchise conferred by an ordinance adopted in 1902 by the City in the exercise of a power given it by the local legislative authority.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*263</span> From the beginning, in giving effect to the provision of the franchise ordinance requiring that \"members of the Police and Fire Departments of the City of Manila wearing official badges shall be entitled to ride free upon the cars of the grantee,\" that requirement was treated by the grantee as not embracing members of the detective branch of the Police Department who did not publicly wear official badges, although having such badges concealed upon their persons in such manner that they could be exposed or inspected when desired.</p>\n<p>In 1914 the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, deeming that members of the detective force not publicly wearing their badges were entitled to ride free under the provisions of the ordinance, after notice and hearing to the Railroad on the subject, entered an order directing that members of the detective force be allowed to ride free under the circumstances stated. The Railroad, challenging the validity of the order, refused to obey it and, availing of the remedy provided by the local law, invoked the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.

The court, passing as unnecessary to be considered all the contentions made by the Railroad but the single one concerning the duty of the company under the franchise ordinance to furnish the free transportation ordered, decided that under the text of that ordinance the duty to furnish such transportation did not exist, and therefore set aside the order of the Commissioners.
