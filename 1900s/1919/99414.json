The ground upon which it is sought to bring the case here on writ of error rests upon the assertion that the Supreme Judicial Court erred in sustaining the succession tax because it was imposed on or on account of real estate situated outside of Massachusetts; therefore, rendering the assessment of the tax a violation of rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*222</span> the Constitution of the United States, in that it took the property of the plaintiff in error without due process of law.</p>\n<p>The case was decided, and the decree entered in the Supreme Judicial Court since the passage of the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726, amending \u00a7 237 of the Judicial Code. Since the passage of the amendment, cases brought within its effect, of the character of this one, cannot be brought here by writ of error unless there is drawn in question the validity of a statute of or an authority exercised under the State on the ground of their being repugnant to the Federal Constitution, treaties or laws.
