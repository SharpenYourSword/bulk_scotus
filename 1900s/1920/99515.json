Lewellyn and Worth Bros. Co. v. Lederer, 258 Fed. 533. The last two cases we have just decided (251 U. S. 501, 40 Sup. Ct. 283, 64 L. Ed. &#8212;&#8212;; 251 U. S. 507, 40 Sup. Ct. 282, 64 L. Ed. &#8212;&#8212;), and we can immediately say that, if this case does not differ from them in its facts, it does not in principle. It will turn, as they did, upon the construction of section 301 of the Munitions Tax Act (39 Stat. 756, 781 [Comp. St. &#167; 6336 1/4 b]) which imposes upon 'every person manufacturing * * * shells * * * <i>or any part</i>' [italics ours] of them, a tax of 12 1/2 per cent. for each taxable year upon the entire net profits received or accrued for such years from the sale or disposition of the shells manufactured in the United States. The contention in the Worth Case was explicitly, as it is in this case, that the words 'any part,' as used in the act, 'mean a substantially finished part'&#8212;a part, as there said, which has relation 'to the whole structure and to the purpose it is intended to subserve.' Here it is said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The fundamental idea of a manufactured article is that it      must be so nearly completed as to be serviceable for the      purpose for which it was designed.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasoning of the Worth Case, covers, therefore, the contention here, and rejects it, if, as we have said, the facts be the same, and we think they are. There are some circumstances of complexity, but they are easily resolved and do not disturb the principle of decision. Of the facts the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'From the proofs it appears the British government made      contracts with certain persons whereby the latter agreed to      supply it with high explosive shells in compliance with the      specifications, requirement, and inspection of the said      government. To fulfill such shell contract the contractor      made subcontracts with the Forged Steel Wheel Company, by      which the latter agreed to manufacture and furnish to said      contractor, rough steel sheel forgins  of the character      provided in the contract, as to chemical constituents,      tensile strength, size, shape, etc. To fulfill its contract,      the Forged Steel Wheel Company either made, had made, or      bought in the market, the grade of steel required. This steel      was of a common commercial type known as rounds. These rounds      in nicked and broke into eighteen-inch lengths, which it then      heated and put through two forging processes, by the first of      which a holde was pierced from one end of the round to within      two inches of the other; by the second, the round was      lengthened by drawing it through three successive rings of a hydraulic press. The      output of the Forged Steel Wheel Company's work was a hollow      steel body or shell form, of suitable composition, shape, and      length, from which to make, to the British government      standards, the high explosive projectiles contracted for. The      weight of such shell forms was about 170 pounds. To make this      shell form suitable for use as a shell the contractor to whom      the Forged Steel Wheel Company then delivered it was required      to dress, bore, and machine it down to 77 pounds; this      required some 27 distinct and separate processes.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court, after further comment on the facts, and consideration of the opinion of the District Court and its reasoning, and distinguishing the cases that influenced the District Court, said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'But in the excise law in question Congress is dealing with      the imposing of taxes as the main object, and with the work      done as a mere incident to aid in determining the tax.

They are Tide Water Oil Co. v. United States, 171 U. S. 210, 218, 18 Sup. Ct. 837, 43 L. Ed. 139; Worthington v. Robbins, 139 U. S. 337, 11 Sup. Ct. 581, 35 L. Ed. 181; Anheuser-Busch Association v. United States, 207 U. S. 556, 28 Sup. Ct. 204, 52 L. Ed. 336. These were customs cases, and the statutes were given an interpretation on account of their purpose. They are, besides, not in point. In the first one the statute had the words 'wholly manufactured,' and, giving effect to them, it was decided that boxes made from shooks imported from Canada, though nailed together and the sides of the boxes thus formed trimmed in the United States, were not boxes 'wholly manufactured' in the United States, and entitled, upon being exported, to a drawback under a statute which allowed a drawback on articles 'wholly manufactured of materials imported.' The Worthington Case was cited. In that case a duty was exacted upon 'white hard enamel' under a statute which imposed a duty of 25 per cent. upon 'watches, watch cases, watch movements, parts of watches and watch materials.' This on the contention of the government that the enamel fell under the head of 'watch materials.' The contention was rejected; it being conceded that the enamel was used for many other purposes than for watch faces. In the Anheuser-Busch Case a claim of drawback upon corks exported with bottled beer was rejet ed. The ground of the claim was that the corks were subjected to a special treatment to be fit for use, and hence it was contended that they should be regarded as 'imported materials * * * used in the manufacture of articles manufactured or produced in the United States'&#8212;that is, the bottled beer. We replied 'a cork put through the claimant's process is still a cork.' The cases, therefore, do not sustain the contention for which they are cited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Objection is made to the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals in simply reversing the judgment of the District Court and not remanding the case for a new trial.
