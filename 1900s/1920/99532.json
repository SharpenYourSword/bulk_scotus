St. &#167;&#167; 8657-8665), and from the individual defendant under the common law. Each defendant filed a special demurrer on the ground of misjoinder of causes of action and misjoinder of parties defendant. The demurrers were overruled by the trial court. The Court of Appeals&#8212;an intermediate appellate court to which the case went on exceptions certified to the Supreme Court of the state the question whether such joinder was permissible. It answered in the negative. 147 Ga. 428, 94 S. E. 558. Thereupon the Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court (21 Ga. App. 558, 94 S. E. 888), and certiorari to the Supreme Court of the state was refused. The plaintiff then applied to this court for a writ of certiorari on the ground that he had been denied rights conferred by federal law, and the writ was granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether two causes of action may be joined i. e. single count or whether two persons may be sued in a single count are matters of pleading and practice relating solely to the form of the remedy. When they arise in state courts the final determination of such matters ordinarily rests with the state tribunals, even if the rights there being enforced are created by federal law. John v.

To deny to a plaintiff the right to join in one count a cause against another employe with a cause of action against the employer in no way abridges any substantive right of the plaintiff against the employer. The argument that plaintiff has been discriminated against because he is an interstate employe is answered, if answer be necessary, by the fact that the Supreme Court of Georgia had applied the same rule in Western &amp; Atlantic R. R. et al. v. Smith, 144 Ga. 737, 87 S. E. 1082 (22 Ga. App. 437, 96 S. E. 230), where it refused under the state Employers' Liability Act (Civ. Code 1910, &#167; 2782 et seq.) to permit the plaintiff to join with the employer another railroad whose concurrent negligence was alleged to have contributed in producing the injury complained of. If the Supreme Court of Georgia had in this case permitted the joinder, we might have been required to determine whether, in view of the practice prevailing in Georgia, such decision would not impair the employer's opportunity to make the defenses to which it is entitled by the federal law. For, as stated by its Supreme Court in this case (147 Ga. 428, 431, 94 S. E. 558, 560):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'If the carrier and its engineer were jointly liable under      the conditions stated in the second question, a joint      judgment would result against them, and they would be equally      bound, regardless of the fact that the duties imposed upon      them are not the same. The jury would have no power in such a      case to specify the particular damages to be recovered of      each, since Civil Code, &#167; 4512 [providing for verdicts in      different amounts against the several defendants] is not      applicable to personal torts.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But we have no occasion to consider this question.
