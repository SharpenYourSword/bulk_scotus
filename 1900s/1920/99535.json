This seed, when treated by a simple process, yielded about 20 pounds of linseed oil and about 36 pounds of linseed oil cake, to the bushel. The oil was much more valuable than the oil cake; the latter being composed of the solid substance of the seed and a small amount of oil not recovered, which made it valuable as a feed for stock. It is a by-product, and, except for the small amount of oil in it, would be mere waste.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant exported large quantities of oil cake, derived from seed which it had imported, and made demand in proper form for the drawback provided for by the act of Congress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law providing for such drawbacks has differed in form of expression from time to time but, since the Act of August 5, 1861 (12 Stat. c. 45, p. 253), it has not differed in substance from the Act of 1894, as we have quoted it. The number of articles to which the law is applicable is very great, among them, notably, 'refined sugar and syrup which come from imported raw sugar and refined sugar and syrup which come from imported molasses.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Court of Claims found that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'From August 5, 1861, to the present time the practice of the      Treasury Department, where several articles are manufactured      from the same imported material, has been to calculate and to      pay the drawback by distributing the duty paid on the      imported material between such articles in proportion to the      value and not in proportion to their weight, as well where      the imported material paid a specific as well as where it      paid an ad valorem duty.

What was the amount of duty paid on the small amount of oil and on the large amount of solid substance, the hull and the fiber, which made up the exported oil cake? Was it substantially two-thirds of the total, determined by weight&#8212;on 36 of 56 pounds&#8212;or was it about one-fourth of the total as determined by the relative values of the oil and of the oil cake derived from the seed? The terms of the provision show that the contingency of having one kind of dutiable material, from which two or more kinds of manufactured products might be derived, is not specifically provided for. Obviously only a part, the least valuable part, of the materials or ingredients of the linseed were used in the making of oil cake, and therefor the problem of determining the 'drawback equal in amount to the duty paid' on the part so used the solid parts of the seed and the small amount of oil in the oil cake&#8212;was not a simple or an easy one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute, thus indefinite if not ambiguous, called for construction by the department and the regulation adapted to cases such as we have here, commends itself strongly to our judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It does not seem possible that Congress could have intended that two-thirds of the duty should be returned when one-quarter in value of the manufactured product should be exported; or that the exporter should retain 20 pounds of oil, estimated in the findings as worth about 7 1/2 cents a pound, derived from each bushel of seed, and recover two-thirds of the duty paid when he exported 36 pounds of seed cake, worth slightly more than 1 cent a pound, derived from the same bushel of seed. Such results&#8212;they must follow the acceptance of the appellant's contention&#8212;should be allowed only under compulsion of imperative language such as is not to be found in the section we are considering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We prefer the reasonable interpretation of the department, which results in a refund of one-quarter of the duty when one-quarter of the value of the product is exported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From Edwards v.

Ed. 405, it has been the settled law that, when uncertainty or ambiguity, such as we have here, is found in a statute, great weight will be given to the contemporaneous construction by department officials, who were called upon to act under the law and to carry its pro visions into effect, especially where such construction has been long continued, as it was in this case for almost 40 years before the petition was filed. United States v. Hill, 120 U. S. 169, 7 Sup. Ct. 510, 30 L.

The Tariff Act approved July 14, 1870 (16 Stat. 256, 265, c. 255), expressly provided, in the flaxseed or linseed paragraph, 'that no drawback shall be allowed on oil cake made from imported seed,' and this provision was continued in the Tariff Act of March 3, 1883 (22 Stat. 488, 513), and in the Act of October 1, 1890 (26 Stat. 567, 586). But in the Act of 1894 (28 Stat. 509, 523), the prohibition was eliminated, thus restoring the law on this subject as applied to this material to what it was in substance from 1861 to 1870. United States v. Philbrick, 120 U. S. 52, 59, 7 Sup. Ct. 413, 30 L. Ed. 559. During all the intervening 24 years this rule of the department with respect to drawbacks had been widely applied to many articles of much greater importance than linseed or its derivatives, and the practice was continued, linseed included after 1894, until the petition in this case was filed. The re-enacting of the drawback provision four times, without substantial change, while this method of determining what should be paid under it was being constantly employed, amounts to an implied legislative recognition and approval of the executive construction of the statute (United States v. Philbrick, supra; United States v. G. Falk &amp; Brother, 204 U. S. 143, 152, 27 Sup. Ct. 191, 51 L. Ed. 411; United States v. Cerecedo Hermanos y Compania, 209 U. S. 337, 28 Sup. Ct. 532, 52 L.

The Tariff Act, approved July 14, 1870, c. 255, 16 Stat. 256, 265, expressly provided, in the flax-seed or linseed paragraph, \"That no drawback shall be allowed on oil cake made from imported seed,\" and this provision was continued in the Tariff Act of March 3, 1883, c. 121, 22 Stat. 488, 513, and in the Act of October 1, 1890, c. 1244, 26 Stat. 567, 586. But in the Act of 1894, 28 Stat. 509, 523, the prohibition was eliminated, thus restoring the law on this subject as applied to this material to what it was in substance from 1861 to 1870. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Philbrick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91815\"><a href=\"/opinion/91815/united-states-v-philbrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 59. During all the intervening twenty-four years this rule of the Department with respect to drawbacks had been widely applied to many articles of much greater importance than linseed or its derivatives, and the practice was continued, linseed included after 1894, until the petition in this case was filed. The reenacting of the drawback provision four times, without substantial change, while this method of determining what should be paid under it was being constantly employed, amounts to an implied legislative recognition and approval of the executive construction of the statute, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Philbrick, supra</i><i>; </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>G. Falk &amp; Brother,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96568\"><a href=\"/opinion/96568/united-states-v-g-falk-brother/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">143</span></a></span>, 152; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Cerecedo</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*147</span> <i>Hermanos y Compania,</i> 209 U.S. 337; for Congress is presumed to have legislated with knowledge of such an established usage of an executive department of the Government. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Bailey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85932\"><a href=\"/opinion/85932/united-states-v-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span>, 256.</p>\n<p>This case would not deserve even the limited discussion which we thus have given it were it not for the extensive and long continued application of the regulation of the Department to imported and exported materials other than such as are here involved. This specific case is sufficiently ruled by the clear and satisfactory decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, rendered twenty-two years ago, in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Dean Linseed-Oil Co.,</i> 87 Fed.Rep. 453, in which the Court of Claims found authority for dismissing the plaintiff's petition.
