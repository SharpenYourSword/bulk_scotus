St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, &#167; 8739a]) which declares that &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Whoever shall * * * cause intoxicating liquors to be      transported in interstate commerce, except for scientific,      sacramental, medicinal, and mechanical purposes, into any      state * * * the laws of which * * *p rohibit the manufacture      or sale therein of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes      shall be punished,' etc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And the question for decision is whether the statute was applicable where the liquor&#8212;five quarts of whisky&#8212;was transported by its owner in his own automobile and was for his personal use and not for an excepted purpose. The District Court answered the question in the negative and on that ground sustained a demurrer to the third count, which is all that is here in question and discharged the accused. 257 Fed. 860.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the question should have been answered the other way. The evil against which the statute was directed was the introduction of intoxicating liquor into a prohibition state from another state for purposes other than those specially excepted&#8212;a matter which Congress could and the states could not control. Danciger v. Cooley, 248 U. S. 319, 323, 39 Sup. Ct. 119, 63 L. Ed. 266. The introduction could be effected only through transportation, and whether this took one form or another it was transportation in interstate commerce. Kelley v. Rhoads, 188 U. S. 1, 23 Sup. Ct. 259, 47 L. Ed. 359; United States v. Chavez, 228 U. S. 525, 532, 533, 33 Sup. Ct. 595, 57 L. Ed. 950; United States v. Mesa, 228 U. S. 533, 33 Sup. Ct. 597, 57 L. Ed. 953; Pipe Line Cases, 234 U.

The statute makes no distinction between different modes of transportation and we think it was intended to include them all, that being the natural import of its words. Had Congress intended to confine it to transportation by railroads and other common carriers it well may be assumed that other words appropriate to the expression of that intention would have been used. And it also may be assumed that Congress foresaw that if the statute were thus confined it could be so readily and extensively evaded by the use of automobiles, autotrucks and other private vehicles that it would not be of much practical benefit. See Kirmeyer v. Kansas, 236 U. S. 568, 35 Sup. Ct. 419, 59 L. Ed. 721. At all events we perceive no reason for rejecting the natural import of its words and holdings that it was confined to transportation for hire or by public carriers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The published decisions show that a number of the federal courts have regarded the statute as embracing transportation by automobile, and have applied it in cases where the transportation was personal and private, as here.

Colorado prohibited the manu facture and sale therein of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes.

The liquor involved in this case, after it was purchased and while it was being held for the personal use of the defendant, was, certainly, withdrawn from trade or commerce as thus defined&#8212;it was no longer in the channels of commerce, of trade or of business of any kind&#8212;and when it was carried by its owner, for his personal use, across a state line, in my judgment it was not moved or transported in interstate commerce, within the scope of the Act of Congress relied upon or of any legislation which Congress had the constitutional power to enact with respect to it at the time the Reed Amendment was approved.
