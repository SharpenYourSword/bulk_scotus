Counsel for plaintiffs in error well say, but one question is presented for our determination \u0097 \"Were the lands involved in this action `public lands' within the meaning of the acts of Congress dated July 1, 1862, and July 2, 1864, granting a right of way to the Leavenworth, Pawnee &amp; Western Railway Company and its successors?\"</p>\n<p>The cause was tried by the court below upon pleadings and Agreed Statement of Facts; and a memorandum states the reasons for judgment favorable to the railroad.</p>\n<p>By the Act of July 1, 1862, c. 120, 12 Stat. 489, Congress granted a right of way \"two hundred feet in width on each side of said railroad where it may pass over the public lands\" (<i>Stuart</i> v. <i>Union Pacific R.R. Co.,</i> 227 U.S. 342, 345), and declared \"The United States shall extinguish as rapidly as may be the Indian titles to all lands falling under the operation of this act and required for the said <span class=\"star-pagination\">*444</span> right of way and grants hereinafter made.\" Some amendments added by the Act of July 3, 1866, c. 159, 14 Stat. 79, are not specially important here.</p>\n<p>It is said that under treaties of 1846 and 1861 with the United States (9 Stat. 853; 12 Stat. 245) the Pottawatomie Reservation was no part of the \"public lands\"; moreover, that Congress lacked power to grant rights therein to a railroad company.</p>\n<p>In <i>Kindred</i> v. <i>Union Pacific R.R.

That case renders clear the definite purpose of Congress to treat Indian Reservations, subject to its control, as public lands within the right-of-way provision. This provision is not to be regarded as bestowing bounty on the railroad; it stands upon a somewhat different footing from private grants and should receive liberal construction favorable to the purposes in view. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Denver &amp; Rio Grande Ry.

Beecher v. Wetherby, 95 U. S. 517, 525, 24 L. Ed. 440. The power of Congress, as guardian for the Indians, to legislate in respect of such lands is settled. Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas Railway Co., 135 U. S. 641, 653, 10 Sup. Ct. 965, 34 L. Ed. 295; United States v. Rowell et al., 243 U. S. 464, 468, 37 Sup. Ct. 425, 61 L. Ed. 848; United States v. Chase, 245 U.

All who thereafter acquired public lands took subject to such granted right. Railroad Co. v. Baldwin, 103 U. S. 426, 430, 26 L. Ed. 578. Although parties to the treaty of 1861 contemplated future allotments, it made none. No individual title to any portion of the land arose until allotted, and none was allotted until after 1862.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any claim by plaintiffs in error based upon adverse occupancy or possession is precluded by Northern Pacific Railroad Co. v.
