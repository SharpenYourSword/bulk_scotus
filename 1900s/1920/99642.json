The contractor defaulted and was later adjudicated a bankrupt. The loss to the Government was about $13,000. The Surety Company paid to it on account of this loss $3,150, the full amount of the liability on the bonds. Thereupon the Government proved its claim in bankruptcy for the balance, claiming, under Revised Statutes, \u00a7 3466,<sup>[1]</sup> priority therefor over all other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> creditors. The Surety Company proved for the $3,150, and claimed that under Revised Statutes, \u00a7 3468,<sup>[1a]</sup> it was entitled to a share in the distribution of the estate <i>pro rata</i> on an equality with the Government. The net assets of the estate were less than the amount of the Government's claim.

The priority secured to the United States by \u00a7 3466 is priority over all other creditors; that is, private persons and other public bodies. This priority the surety obtains upon discharging its obligation. But what the surety asks here is not to enjoy like priority over such other creditors, but equality with the United States, a creditor whose debt it partly secured. To accord such equality would abridge the priority expressly conferred upon the Government. While the priority given the surety by the statute attaches as soon as the obligation upon the bond is discharged, it cannot ripen into enjoyment unless or until the whole debt due the United States is satisfied. This result is in harmony with a familiar rule of the law of subrogation under which a surety liable only for part of the debt does not become subrogated to collateral or to remedies available to the creditor unless he pays the whole debt or it is otherwise satisfied.<sup>[1b]</sup></p>\n<p>The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]   Sec. 3466.
