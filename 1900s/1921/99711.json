The appellant, not denying that the jurisdiction of this court to review judgments or decrees of the District Court for Porto Rico in cases such as the present one was taken away by the act conferring upon the Circuit Court of Appeals of the First Circuit appellate power over that subject (Act Jan. 28, 1915, c. 22, &#167; 1 [Comp. St. &#167; 1107]; Id. &#167; 2, amending sections 128 and 238 Judicial Code [Comp. St. &#167;&#167; 1120, 1215]; Id. &#167; 3, repealing section 244, Judicial Code [36 Stat. 1157]; 38 Stat. 803, 804), nevertheless insists that by virtue of the jurisdiction of this court to review judgments and decrees of the Circuit Courts of Appeals, the power taken away is in substance preserved if only successive appeals be resorted to. This rests upon the proposition that, as the act transferring the jurisdiction from this to the Circuit Court of Appeals brought this case within the jurisdiction of the latter court, it hence subjected the decree in this case to the test of finality and the right of review provided in section 128 of the Judicial Code controlling those subjects. While if the section be considered superficially the argument is plausible, its unsoundness becomes apparent by the briefest examination of the context and genesis of the section. Virtually every word of the section relied upon to establish that the decree was not final and to justify the asserted right to review it in this court depends upon limitations expressed in the Judiciary Act of 1891, (26 Stat. 826), and which were intended to carry out the great purposes of that act, to distribute the appellate power of the courts of the United States in the proper sense and were therefore inapplicable to the Porto Rican court. To illustrate, one of the broad distinctions made in the distribution of appellate power under the act of 1891 depended upon whether the jurisdiction of the federal court as fixed by law was exclusively called into play because of diverse citizenship, in the constitutional sense, or whether the jurisdiction was invoked because, aside from diverse citizenship, there existed a federal right or question; a judgment being in one case made final in one court where it was not in the other, and also being subject to one method of review in the one and a different in the other. Thus the proposition is that, because by Act of Congress jurisdiction was conferred upon the Circuit Court of Appeals to review a judgment of the Porto Rican court, therefore by the mere exertion of that jurisdiction the Porto Rican judgment was brought under the control, as to finality and review, of provisions having no possible application or relation to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The act of Congress by which jurisdiction was conferred upon the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit additionally makes clear the misconception upon which the argument rests. At the time that act was passed the jurisdiction of this court to review the Porto Rican court embraced two classes of cases, the one involving enumerated federal questions, in the true sense, and the other where the power depended upon the amount involved.

But the transferring act did not divest this court of appellate jurisdiction over the Porto Rican court, but on the contrary preserved its authority, although in some respects limiting and in others enlarging it, and transferred to the Circuit Courts of Appeals appellate jurisdiction in all cases other than those in which jurisdiction by direct appeal was conferred upon this court, unless otherwise provided by law&#8212;a result which clearly negates that it was contemplated that a right to successive appeals should exist, and which, moreover, indisputably shows that it was the purpose of Congress not to give the Circuit Court of Appeals an authority which it could not exert compatibly with the distribution of federal appellate judicial power made by the act of 1891.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, we might well have spared ourselves the duty of expressing the considerations we have stated since the proposition relied upon in virtually foreclosed by the ruling in Inter-Island Steam Navigation Co. v.
