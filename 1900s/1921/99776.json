Under § 4914 of the Revised Statutes no opinion or decision of the Court of Appeals on appeal from the Commissioner precludes `any person interested from the right to contest the validity of such patent in any court wherein the same may be called in question,' and by § 4915 a remedy by bill in equity is given where a patent is refused, and we regard these provisions as applicable in trade-mark cases under § 9 of the Act of February 20, 1905.\"</p>\n<p>We are of opinion that the principle there announced controls this case. No provision is made which permits this statutory proceeding to be carried beyond the decision of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, the decision of which court is directed to be certified to the Commissioner of Patents. It is in no sense a final <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> judgment reviewable here upon writ of certiorari or appeal.</p>\n<p>It is true that in <i>Estate of Beckwith</i> v. <i>Commissioner of Patents,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99575\"><a href=\"/opinion/99575/estate-of-pd-beckwith-inc-v-commissioner-of-patent/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span>, this court allowed a writ of certiorari from a decision of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, affirming a decision of the Commissioner of Patents, in an application to register a trade-mark. No question of the jurisdiction of the court was considered in that case, and an inadvertent allowance of the writ of certiorari does not establish the jurisdiction of the court. <i>Fritch, Inc.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99281\"><a href=\"/opinion/99281/j-homer-fritch-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">248</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span>, 463.</p>\n<p>It follows that the appeal must be dismissed, and the petition for a writ of certiorari denied.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 99776, "judges": "Day", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/99776/", "sha1": "4d0b1cf4ea2e37e4af5ed9ba40ef3dae7c5594a9", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:47:18"}
