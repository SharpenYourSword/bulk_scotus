That the addition of sulphuric acid prevents nitric acid from attacking steel is a well-known fact concerning which there is no very satisfactory explanation. The court below found the sulphuric acid was added solely for transportation purposes, and that the result was not a mixture merchantable as such for use in the United States. It accordingly held that no duty should have been damanded and among other things said: 'The word 'preparations' [in paragraph 5] implies of           course that they are something prepared and adapted to           particular uses or services.
