This conclusion, we think, accords with common observation, harmonizes with what has been declared heretofore concerning liability of the District of Columbia for torts, and is supported by well-considered cases.

Such powers are generally regarded as discretionary, because,      in their nature, they are legislative; and although it is the      duty of such corporations to carry out the powers so granted      and make them beneficial, still it has never been held that      an action on the case would lie against the corporation, at      the suit of an individual, for the failure on their part to      perform such a duty. * * * Whether the action in this case is      maintainable against the defendants or not, depends upon the      terms and conditions of their charter, as is obvious from the      views already advanced.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barnes v.
