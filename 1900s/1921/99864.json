At the time of the accident the railroad was being operated by the company. When suit was brought the railroad was under federal control. The company pleaded in abatement that the plaintiff was not a resident of Hinds County when the alleged injury occurred and that the alleged cause of action did not arise in the district of the county in which suit was brought. And it set up Order No. 18 of the Director General of Railroads, as amended April 18, 1918, which prohibited the institution of suits against railroads under federal control in the court for any district other than that in which the plaintiff had resided or in which the alleged cause of action arose.<sup>[1]</sup> A demurrer to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*113</span> plea was sustained; the plaintiff then recovered a verdict; and the judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the highest court of the State. 122 Miss. 742.
