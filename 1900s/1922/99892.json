It is copied in the margin.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Purporting to proceed under this section plaintiff in error brought an action in the Supreme Court, District of Columbia, against James Linn Rodgers, once Consul-General <span class=\"star-pagination\">*468</span> at Shanghai, China, and the sureties upon his official bond. Process was served upon him but the sureties were not summoned and did not appear. The declaration alleges execution of the bond, its breach by Rodgers' failure to discharge his official duties concerning property left by plaintiff's brother who died in China June 10, 1905, and asks a recovery upon the bond for damages suffered. The trial court sustained a demurrer to the declaration, and upon appeal this action was affirmed.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals held that if the Consul-General's failure to perform his official duties concerning the personal property caused loss, the damage was to the estate, and plaintiff, being a mere possible owner of a distributive share, could not recover in his own right \u0097 any possible right of action was in the administrator. This we think was clearly right.</p>\n<p>The second count of the painfully prolix declaration alleges \"that there were left by said decedent certain valuable real property in the Pao Shan District in Shanghai, China, of the value of, to wit, $5,000.00, which, outstanding in decedent's name in the Land Records of said United States Consulate at Shanghai, China, it was the duty of the said defendant, James Linn Rodgers, to conserve to said decedent's estate; but notwithstanding his said duty in this respect and in utter violation thereof, and in breach of the condition of his said bond and writing obligatory, he, the said defendant, James Linn Rodgers, instructed one E.H. Dunning to convey and transfer the same over to a certain Mrs. Green, gratuitously, and without any consideration passing therefor, four days after he had illegally and improperly granted alleged letters testamentary to the said E.H. Dunning . . . that no such real estate was devised or sought to be devised under the paper writing hereinbefore referred to as the pretended last will and testament of the said Henry H. Cunningham, deceased . . . and said <span class=\"star-pagination\">*469</span> assumption of a jurisdiction and power to so instruct the said E.H.

Under such circumstances mere allegation that defendant unlawfully assumed to instruct one holding void letters testamentary to transfer such property without consideration is wholly insufficient to show an actionable breach of official duty, or adequately to point out personal damage suffered by plaintiff in error.
