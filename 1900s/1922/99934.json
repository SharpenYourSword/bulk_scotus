From this point, as a beginning, a series of      straight lines was laid out to conform with the decree of the      court, special care being taken to have the lines over water      not less than eight feet deep as shown by the Meade map, and      the angle points between said lines numbered consecutively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'From such of these angle points as were convenient 'ties'      were scaled to the best situated triangulation points on the      map, and by means of rectangular co-ordinates from each angle      point on the lines between the 'ties,' to triangulation      points, the lengths and angles of deviation of the several      lines were calculated, and closed polygons formed. These      polygons were then checked as to closure by the method of latitudes and departures, and any      errors found were balanced so as to secure closure. By this      means your commissioners were enabled, with a close approach      to accuracy, to determine the lengths and angles of deviation      of the several lines composing the projected boundary line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The lengths and angles thus determined and the 'ties' to the      several triangulation points were used as preliminary field      notes by the surveying party employed to 'run out the      boundary line and to locate same by proper monuments, courses      and distances.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Boundary Line Above Fond du Lac.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'For that portion of the St. Louis river beyond Fond du Lac,      and extending to the 'Falls,' and which is not shown on the      Meade chart or map, the commission established the center      line of the river, as a medial line between the shore lines,      as surveyed by the commission, and designated said medial      line as the boundary line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The Survey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'As the boundary line, except in a few instances, runs over      water from 8 feet to over 20 feet in depth, the most      convenient time for surveying it was after ice had formed to      a safe thickness. The winter proved to be mild and the ice      conditions unfavorable, adding greatly to the danger and      difficulty of the work, and increasing the time necessary to      finish it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The surveying party was organized early in January, 1921,      and the necessary equipment was rented or purchased. Starting      at station O, heretofore described, the approximate position      of the boundary line was laid out on the ice, in the bay and      river, from the preliminary field notes, and the 'ties' to      the triangulation points, measured. Such discrepancies, due      to the curvature of the earth, or to errors in scaling from      the map, as were shown by measuring the 'ties,' were allowed for and      distributed in the angles and distances of all the lines back      to the preceding 'tie.' If any important discrepancy was      discovered, the lines involved were re-run before any      adjustments were made, From the final field notes of the      adjusted survey, a description of the boundary line by      courses and distances was obtained, and is incorporated      herein.

From this point, as a beginning, a series of      straight lines was laid out to conform with the decree of the      court, special care being taken to have the lines over water      not less than eight feet deep as shown by the Meade map, and      the angle points between said lines numbered consecutively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'From such of these angle points as were convenient 'ties'      were scaled to the best situated triangulation points on the      map, and by means of rectangular co-ordinates from each angle      point on the lines between the 'ties,' to triangulation      points, the lengths and angles of deviation of the several      lines were calculated, and closed polygons formed. These      polygons were then checked as to closure by the method of latitudes and departures, and any      errors found were balanced so as to secure closure. By this      means your commissioners were enabled, with a close approach      to accuracy, to determine the lengths and angles of deviation      of the several lines composing the projected boundary line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The lengths and angles thus determined and the 'ties' to the      several triangulation points were used as preliminary field      notes by the surveying party employed to 'run out the      boundary line and to locate same by proper monuments, courses      and distances.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Boundary Line Above Fond du Lac.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'For that portion of the St. Louis river beyond Fond du Lac,      and extending to the 'Falls,' and which is not shown on the      Meade chart or map, the commission established the center      line of the river, as a medial line between the shore lines,      as surveyed by the commission, and designated said medial      line as the boundary line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The Survey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'As the boundary line, except in a few instances, runs over      water from 8 feet to over 20 feet in depth, the most      convenient time for surveying it was after ice had formed to      a safe thickness. The winter proved to be mild and the ice      conditions unfavorable, adding greatly to the danger and      difficulty of the work, and increasing the time necessary to      finish it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The surveying party was organized early in January, 1921,      and the necessary equipment was rented or purchased. Starting      at station O, heretofore described, the approximate position      of the boundary line was laid out on the ice, in the bay and      river, from the preliminary field notes, and the 'ties' to      the triangulation points, measured. Such discrepancies, due      to the curvature of the earth, or to errors in scaling from      the map, as were shown by measuring the 'ties,' were allowed for and      distributed in the angles and distances of all the lines back      to the preceding 'tie.' If any important discrepancy was      discovered, the lines involved were re-run before any      adjustments were made, From the final field notes of the      adjusted survey, a description of the boundary line by      courses and distances was obtained, and is incorporated      herein.
