Two of the lines of railroad forming part of the Louisville &amp; Nashville system were built with the aid of such grants. For all transportation to which that provision applies, the rates payable by the government are now fixed at 50 per cent. of those charged private persons. See United States v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., 249 U. S. 354, 39 Sup. Ct. 294, 63 L. Ed. 643. The company brought this suit in the Court of Claims to recover the balance of the full rate, alleging that the auditors and the Comptroller of the Treasury had erred in applying the land grant rates to transportation of certain officers and men who were not 'troops' of the United States, although in its service. That court dismissed the petition (55 Ct.
