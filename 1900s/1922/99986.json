St. &#167; 1215), recited that the complainants operated a manufacturing plant for the production of cotton goods in Gaston county, North Carolina; that the defendant was a federal collector of internal revenue; that on the ground that complainants had employed children in their factory within the limits of ages prescribed in section 1200, the act of Congress, known as the Child Labor Tax Law, approved February 24, 1919 (40 Stat. 1057, 1138 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, &#167; 6336 7/8 a]), they were under its terms assessed the sum of $2,098.06; that they filed a claim for abatement of the same, which was denied, that the collector was about to make the exaction by distraining complainants' property, levying on it and selling it, that the act of Congress purporting to authorize the assessment was invalid under the Constitution of the United States, and on these grounds permanently enjoined the collector from proceeding to collect the assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An examination of the bill shows no other ground for equitable relief than as stated in the order.
