The business of those in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*159</span> Class A was wholly confined to representation of nonresident principals.

The state courts, by whose construction we are bound, held that the statute did not apply to interstate business; and we consider it as though it so provided in terms. It was held, however, that inasmuch as Class B complainants were engaged in intrastate business they were subject to the tax, and none the less because they were also engaged in interstate business.

It would be a strange application of the equality provision of the Fourteenth Amendment to say that because a State is forbidden by paramount law to impose a tax upon some merchants, it is therefore powerless to impose it upon other merchants to whom the restriction does not apply.
