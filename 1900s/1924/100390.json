The owners appeared as claimants. Excepting to the libel, they prayed that, 'in so far as the action is either in rem or in personam for salvage and in rem for damage,' it be dismissed for want of admiralty jurisdiction. The court maintained the exception, entered a decree of dismissal precisely as prayed for, and allowed an appeal under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. &#167; 1215), with a certificate that 'in this decree the question of jurisdiction alone is in issue.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decree leaves the cause of action in personam for damage undisposed of. For this reason the appeal must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction in this court, although the objection was not taken by the appellee. This court has jurisdiction under section 238, as under others, only of writs of error or appeals from final judgments. And the judgment must be, not only in its nature final, but a complete disposition of the cause. Collins v. Miller, 252 U. S. 364, 370, 40 Sup. Ct. 347, 64 L. Ed. 616. This rule is applicable to appeals in admiralty. Bowker v. United States, 186 U. S. 135, 22 Sup. Ct. 802, 46 L. Ed. 1090; Oneida Nav. Corporation v. W. &amp; S. Job Co., 252 U. S. 251, 40 Sup.
