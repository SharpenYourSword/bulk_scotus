Mr. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*326</span> Robbins was married and the income taxed came from community property in California, acquired before 1917, when some changes were made in the law, and from the earnings of Mr. Robbins. He was required by the Treasury Department to return and pay the tax upon the whole income, against the effort of Mr. and Mrs. Robbins to file returns each of one-half. The result was that he had to pay the amount sued for, above what would have had to be paid if his contention had been allowed. The District Court found the facts as agreed by the parties and upon them ruled that the plaintiffs, the executors of Robbins, were entitled to recover as matter of law. 5 Fed. (2d) 690.

That she has vested rights has been determined by this Court with reference to some jurisdictions, <i>Warburton</i> v. <i>White,</i> 176 U.S. 484; <i>Arnett</i> v. <i>Reade,</i> 220 U.S. 311; and the Treasury Department has carried those rights to the point of allowing a division in the return of community income in other States where the community system prevails.

The latest decision that we have seen dealing directly with the matter explicitly takes that view, says that it is a rule of property that has been settled for more than sixty years, and shows that <i>Arnett</i> v. <i>Reade,</i> 220 U.S. 311, would not be followed in that State. <i>Roberts</i> v. <i>Wehmeyer,</i> 191 Cal. 601, 611, 614.

Even if we are wrong as to the law of California and assume that the wife had an interest in the community income that Congress could tax if so minded, it does not follow that Congress could not tax the husband for the whole.

See <i>Garrozi</i> v. <i>Dastas,</i> 204 U.S. 64. His liability for his wife's support comes from a different source and exists whether there is community property or not.
