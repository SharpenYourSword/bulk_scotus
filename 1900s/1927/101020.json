The mischiefs to be remedied by setting a time limit against distraint are the same as those eliminated by bar against suit.

There has been suggested no principle of public policy or other consideration that furnishes any reasonable support for the setting of a limitation against only one of the two authorized methods of enforcing collection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provision is to be applied in harmony with the intention reasonably to be inferred from its terms and the circumstances of its enactment. Cf. United States v. Oregon Lumber Co., 260 U. S. 290, 299, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100065\"><a href=\"/opinion/100065/united-states-v-oregon-lumber-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span>, 67 L. Ed. 261. Prior to the Revenue Act of 1918 there was no limitation against suit to collect income taxes. Section 250(d) of that act (40 Stat. 1083 (Comp. St. &#167; 6336 1/8 tt)) required assessment within five years after return, and prohibited the commencement of suit or proceeding to collect such taxes after that period. This bar was held to apply only in respect of taxes for 1918 and later years. Then section 250(d) of the act of 1921 made the limitation apply against collection of taxes under all the earlier acts, and, in pursuance of a legislative purpose to require more prompt action upon the part of the Commissioner an collectors, prescribed the five-year period for determination and assessment of taxes under earlier acts but allowed only four years as to those for 1921 and succeeding years. The same purpose is shown by the requirement that the commissioner, within one year after request by their personal representatives, shall make assessments on income received by deceased persons. These stricter limitations applicable to taxes for the later period make against the petitioner's contention that the act sets no bar against collection by distraint. A reasonable view of the matter is that it was the intention of Congress by the clause here in question to protect taxpayers against any proceeding whatsoever for the collection of tax claims not made and pressed within five years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's construction of the limitation is inconsistent with the provision immediately preceding it. 'The amount of any such taxes due under any return * * * shall be determined and assessed within five years after the return was filed, unless both the Commissioner and the taxpayer consent in writing to a later determination, assessment, and collection of the tax.' If collection by distraint were not barred by section 250(d) it would not be necessary to have this general consent of taxpayers that collection, as well as determination and assessment, might be made after the lapse of the prescribed period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later legislation assumes that the limitation under consideration applies to distraints as well as to suits. See section 278(d) and (e), Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 300 (Comp. St. &#167; 6336 1/6 zz(5)). Section 278(d) provides that, where assessment is made within the prescribed time, the tax may be collected by distraint or by a proceeding in court within six years after the assessment. And section 278(e) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'This section shall not authorize the assessment of a tax or      the collection thereof by distraint or by a proceeding in      court if at the time of the enactment of this act such      assessment, distraint, or proceeding was barred by the period      of limitation then in existence.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This plainly implies that distraint might be barred. And the limitation prescribed by section 250(d) is the only one that could have that effect. See also section 278(d) and (e), Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 59.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The word 'proceedings' is rightly used as descriptive of steps taken for the distraint and sale of property to enforce payment of taxes. See Parker v. Rule's Lessee, 9 Cranch, 64, 70, 3 L. Ed. 658; Den ex dem. Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87010\"><a href=\"/opinion/87010/murrays-lessee-v-hoboken-land-improvement-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></a></span>, 15 L. Ed. 372; Sheridan v. Allen (C. C. A.) 153 F. 568. Cf. Scottish Union &amp; Nat. Ins. Co. v. Bowland, 196 U. S. 611, 632, 633, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96226\"><a href=\"/opinion/96226/scottish-union-nat-ins-co-v-bowland/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span>, 50 L. Ed. 652. In a later part, subdivision (g) of section 250, 'proceedings' is used broadly in reference to steps for the collection of taxes. Obviously its meaning is not there limited to collection by suit. And in other parts of the internal revenue laws, enacted before this controversy arose, that word is used as descriptive of steps taken to distrain and sell personal property and to seize and sell real estate for the collection of taxes. See R. S. &#167;&#167; 3194, 3199, 3200, 3203, (Comp.

Cf. United States v. Oregon Lumber Co., 260 U. S. 290, 299, 43 S. Ct. 100, 67 L. Ed. 261. Prior to the Revenue Act of 1918 there was no limitation against suit to collect income taxes. Section 250(d) of that act (40 Stat. 1083 (Comp. St. &#167; 6336 1/8 tt)) required assessment within five years after return, and prohibited the commencement of suit or proceeding to collect such taxes after that period. This bar was held to apply only in respect of taxes for 1918 and later years. Then section 250(d) of the act of 1921 made the limitation apply against collection of taxes under all the earlier acts, and, in pursuance of a legislative purpose to require more prompt action upon the part of the Commissioner an collectors, prescribed the five-year period for determination and assessment of taxes under earlier acts but allowed only four years as to those for 1921 and succeeding years. The same purpose is shown by the requirement that the commissioner, within one year after request by their personal representatives, shall make assessments on income received by deceased persons. These stricter limitations applicable to taxes for the later period make against the petitioner's contention that the act sets no bar against collection by distraint. A reasonable view of the matter is that it was the intention of Congress by the clause here in question to protect taxpayers against any proceeding whatsoever for the collection of tax claims not made and pressed within five years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's construction of the limitation is inconsistent with the provision immediately preceding it. 'The amount of any such taxes due under any return * * * shall be determined and assessed within five years after the return was filed, unless both the Commissioner and the taxpayer consent in writing to a later determination, assessment, and collection of the tax.' If collection by distraint were not barred by section 250(d) it would not be necessary to have this general consent of taxpayers that collection, as well as determination and assessment, might be made after the lapse of the prescribed period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later legislation assumes that the limitation under consideration applies to distraints as well as to suits. See section 278(d) and (e), Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 300 (Comp. St. &#167; 6336 1/6 zz(5)). Section 278(d) provides that, where assessment is made within the prescribed time, the tax may be collected by distraint or by a proceeding in court within six years after the assessment. And section 278(e) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'This section shall not authorize the assessment of a tax or      the collection thereof by distraint or by a proceeding in      court if at the time of the enactment of this act such      assessment, distraint, or proceeding was barred by the period      of limitation then in existence.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This plainly implies that distraint might be barred. And the limitation prescribed by section 250(d) is the only one that could have that effect. See also section 278(d) and (e), Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 59.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The word 'proceedings' is rightly used as descriptive of steps taken for the distraint and sale of property to enforce payment of taxes. See Parker v. Rule's Lessee, 9 Cranch, 64, 70, 3 L. Ed. 658; Den ex dem. Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 15 L. Ed. 372; Sheridan v. Allen (C. C. A.) 153 F. 568. Cf. Scottish Union &amp; Nat. Ins. Co. v. Bowland, 196 U. S. 611, 632, 633, 25 S. Ct. 345, 49 L. Ed. 619; Hale v. Henkel, 201 U. S. 43, 66, 26 S. Ct. 370, 50 L. Ed. 652. In a later part, subdivision (g) of section 250, 'proceedings' is used broadly in reference to steps for the collection of taxes. Obviously its meaning is not there limited to collection by suit. And in other parts of the internal revenue laws, enacted before this controversy arose, that word is used as descriptive of steps taken to distrain and sell personal property and to seize and sell real estate for the collection of taxes.

St. &#167;&#167; 5916, 5921, 5922, 5925), side notes to &#167;&#167; 3190 and 3197 (&#167;&#167; 5912, 5919).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Section 250(d) of the act of 1921 and these sections of the Revised Statutes relate to the same subject and are to be construed together.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that the meaning of 'proceeding' as used in the clause of limitation in section 250(d), Revenue Act of 1921, cannot be restricted to steps taken in a suit; it includes as well steps taken for the collection of taxes by distraint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgments affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The amount of income, excess profits, or war profits taxes due under any return made under this act for the taxable year 1921 or succeeding taxable years shall be determined and assessed by the commissioner within four years after the return was filed, and the amount of any such taxes due under any return made under this act for prior taxable years or under prior income, excess profits, or war profits tax acts * * * shall be determined and assessed within five years after the return was filed, unless both the Commissioner and the taxpayer consent in writing to a later determination, assessment, and collection of the tax; and no suit or proceeding for the collection of any such taxes due under this act or under prior income, excess profits, or war profits tax acts * * * shall be begun, after the expiration of five years after the date when such return was filed, but this shall not affect suits or proceedings begun at the time of the passage of this act.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> By section 2, c. 140, Act of June 27, 1866, 14 Stat. 74, the commissioners appointed to revise the laws of the United Stated were directed to arrange 'side notes so drawn as to point to the contents of the text.'
