United States, 58 Ct. Cl. 392. It is urged that the records in those cases show a blanket approval by the government of the expenditures made for liability insurance in the construction of all the army cantonments. But the Court of Claims specifically found that there was no evidence that the present expenditure was required or approved. By that finding we are concluded. Luckenbach Steamship Co. v.

United States, supra, the court's finding was that the contracting officer had merely approved the particular insurance involved in that suit. In Bates &amp; Rogers Const. Co. v.
