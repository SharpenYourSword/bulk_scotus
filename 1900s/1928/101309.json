JUSTICE SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>McCOY, the petitioner, a Chickasaw Indian of one-fourth blood, brought this suit in equity in a state court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*303</span> of Oklahoma to enjoin the collection of a gross production tax on his one-eighth royalty interest in the oil produced under a lease of lands patented to him as his homestead and surplus allotments from which all restrictions on alienation and incumbrance had been removed \u0097 claiming that this tax on his royalty share in the oil was in violation of the treaties between the United States and the Chickasaw Indians and the Acts of Congress relating thereto. The court dismissed the suit on motion, for want of equity; and this was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, without consideration of the federal question, on the ground that under \u00a7\u00a7 9971 and 9973 of the Compiled Oklahoma Statutes, 1921, the petitioner had a plain, adequate and exclusive remedy at law by paying the tax under protest and suing for its recovery. 124 Okla. 256.</p>\n<p>It is settled law that a judgment of a state court which is put upon a non-federal ground, independent of the federal question involved and broad enough to sustain the judgment, cannot be reviewed by this Court, unless the non-federal ground is so plainly unfounded that it may be regarded as essentially arbitrary or a mere device to prevent the review of a decision upon the federal question. <i>Leathe</i> v. <i>Thomas,</i> 207 U.S. 93, 99; <i>Vandalia Railroad</i> v. <i>South Bend,</i> 207 U.S. 359, 367; <i>Enterprise Irrig.
