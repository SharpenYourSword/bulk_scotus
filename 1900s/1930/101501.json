The relator invokes Article III, Section 2, of the Constitution: \"The Judicial Power shall extend. . . to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls.\" \"In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls . . . the supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction\"; and also the Judicial Code, (Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231) \u00a7 256, \"The jurisdiction vested in the courts of the United States in the cases and proceedings hereinafter mentioned, shall be exclusive of the courts of the several States, . . . <span class=\"star-pagination\">*383</span> Eighth.

Of all suits against consuls and vice-consuls\"; the Supreme Court, by \u00a7 233, being given \"exclusively all such jurisdiction of suits and proceedings against ambassadors or other public ministers, or their domestics or domestic servants, as a court of law can have consistently with the law of nations.\"</p>\n<p>The language so far as it affects the present case is pretty sweeping but like all language it has to be interpreted in the light of the tacit assumptions upon which it is reasonable to suppose that the language was used.
