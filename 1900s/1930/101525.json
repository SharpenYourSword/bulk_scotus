JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>October 17, 1925, appellee delivered to the railroad of the Southern Pacific Company at Kingsburg, California, a shipment of grapes for transportation to Chicago for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> delivery to a named consignee. The appellant received the car at Omaha, hauled it to Chicago and there delivered it to the consignee without collecting the freight and other charges which amounted to $683.79. Because of unreasonable delay on the part of appellant and its failure to use reasonable care to keep the car properly iced, the grapes were delivered in a damaged condition. Appellant sued in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California to recover such charges. And appellee by answer set up the loss. While claiming to have suffered damages of $1,011.70, he asked no affirmative relief but only that the loss be held to be a set-off against appellant's claim. The court allowed the set-off.</p>\n<p>The Circuit Court of Appeals, under \u00a7 239 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C., \u00a7 346, certified to this court the following question:</p>\n<p>\"Where an interstate railroad carrier delivers to the consignee at destination a consignment of freight without collecting the transportation and other lawful charges and thereafter brings an action at law to recover from the shipper the amount thereof, in a United States court in a district where the state law provides that if a defendant omits to set up a counterclaim arising out of the transaction constituting the foundation of the plaintiff's claim he cannot thereafter maintain an action upon the same, and, further, that where such cross-claims have existed `the two demands shall be deemed compensated,' is the shipper, acting in good faith and without collusion, debarred by the Interstate Commerce Acts, particularly the Hepburn Act (34 Stat. 587) from pleading, by way of setoff, a counterclaim for a loss suffered by him as a result of the carrier's failure to perform its obligations touching the transportation and delivery of the identical shipment?\"<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> The appellant is liable to the appellee for damages in an amount at least equal to the charges sued for. 49 U.S.C., \u00a7 20 (11). And unless the Hepburn Act stands in the way, the shipper has the right, under established practice in California, to set up his loss as a counterclaim. 28 U.S.C., \u00a7 724.

Neither is to be distinguished from payment in money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well understood that payment by carriers to shippers under the guise of settling claims for loss and damage may in effect constitute discrimination that the act was intended to prevent. But it is not suggested how opportunity for collusion in respect of such matters would be lessened by abolishing counterclaims in cases such as this. Collusion and fraud may be practiced in the defense and settlement of separate actions brought on such claims, as well as when the same matters are put forward as offsets or counterclaims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The act ought not to be construed to put aside state laws and long-established practice in respect of pleading unless the intention of Congress so to do is plain. There appears no reasonable probability that the relegation of shippers to separate actions for the enforcement of their claims for loss or damage would operate more effectively to enforce the purpose of Congress to prevent discrimination. There is no substantial ground upon which the act may be given the construction for which the carrier contends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question is answered 'No.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There are conflicting decisions on the question.
