JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>These cases involve the same question as <i>United States</i> v. <i>Swift &amp; Co., ante,</i> p. 468; namely, what constitutes the allowance of a credit to a taxpayer who has overpaid his income or profits taxes. The issue is made on facts somewhat different from those involved in that case. It is whether interest to be paid on the amounts credited to the taxpayers shall be calculated as provided by \u00a7 1324 of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 316) or by \u00a7 1019 of the Revenue Act of 1924 (43 Stat. 346). Interest runs from different periods under these acts.

The Commissioner awarded them interest under the Act of 1921. The date of the allowance of the credits becomes important because we have held that interest on refunds and credits must be computed according to the statutory provision in force at the time of their allowance. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Magnolia Petroleum Co.,</i> 276 U.S. 160; <i>Blair</i> v. <i>Birkenstock,</i> 271 U.S. 348.</p>\n<p>Upon audit of respondents' returns for 1918 it was disclosed that their taxes had been overassessed for that year. In March, 1924, the Commissioner approved schedules which informed the Collector of the overassessments and instructed him to check the same against the taxpayers' accounts, determine whether to abate in whole or in part, determine any overpayment, and apportion the same as between credit and refund. In July, 1924, the Collector completed his work, as to both taxpayers' accounts, and executed and forwarded to the Commissioner schedules of refunds and credits attached to the schedules of overassessments. The Commissioner placed his certificate of approval on the schedules of refunds and credits on July 31 and August 7. The Revenue Act of 1924 became effective June 2, 1924. If the credits were allowed after the effective date of that statute the respondents are entitled to interest computed in accordance with \u00a7 1019 of that act; if before, they are entitled to interest computed as provided by \u00a7 1324 of the Revenue Act of 1921.
