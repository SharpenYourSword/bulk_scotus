The action was upon a policy of automobile insurance issued by the defendant, and recovery depended upon judgment having been obtained and execution thereon having been returned unsatisfied in an action against the assured. It was shown that action had been brought in the state court against the assured, the Southwest Motor Sales Company, a Missouri corporation, and also against one Harry Shields, its executive officer. Process had been served upon Shields personally, and jurisdiction of the Southwest Motor Sales Company had been sought by constructive service under the Missouri law.
