It alleged a reasonable attorney's fee would amount to $250.00 and that the matter in controversy exceeded $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs. Removal was denied. Judgment went in favor of Johnson for $3,000; also the court further found and adjudged \"that the plaintiff is entitled to an attorney's fee of $550, and the same is hereby assessed and taxed as a part of the costs in this case.\" Upon appeal the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment. Among other things, it said [pp. 522, 523]:</p>\n<p>\"Appellant contends for a reversal of the judgment upon the ground that the trial court erred in denying its petition for removal of the cause to the Federal Court. It is argued that to include an attorney's fee in the amount sued for exceeds $3,000, interest and costs, and in amount makes the cause a removable one under the Federal Removal Statute (28 U.S.C.A. 41, 71). This court has ruled otherwise in the case of <i>Mutual Life Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Marsh,</i> 185 Ark. 333, 47 S.W. (2d) 585. In the case referred to, it was ruled that an attorney's fee in cases of this nature must be taxed as costs in compliance with the express terms of \u00a7 6135 of Crawford &amp; Moses' Digest.\"</p>\n<p>In Marsh's Case, judgment was sought upon an insurance policy for $3,000, together with 12% penalty and attorneys' fees.

Section 6155, <i>supra,</i> provides that the attorney's fees shall be taxed as costs, but it does not provide that the 12 per cent. penalty shall be taxed as costs. Therefore the amount in controversy was $3,360.\" Evidently, the court concluded because the state statute directed that attorneys' fees should be treated as costs, they were costs within the removal statute. Also, that the prescribed damages were not costs since not so declared.</p>\n<p>But this view was rejected here in <i>Sioux County</i> v. <i>National Surety Co.,</i> 276 U.S. 238, 241.
