The facts, as stated by the court below, were these \u0097</p>\n<p>\"Catherine L. Van Wart, a minor, was the beneficiary of a trust created by the will of her grandfather, Jenkins Jones, deceased. Dr. Roy M. Van Wart, Catherine's father, with whom she resided in Orleans Parish, Louisiana, after being confirmed by order of the district court for that Parish in accordance with the laws of Louisiana as her natural tutor or guardian, and after duly qualifying as such, demanded of the trustees under the will that they pay over to him the accrued income of the trust created in favor of his ward. The trustees, claiming among other things the right to keep possession of the accumulations of such income until Catherine should become of age, when they conceded she would be entitled to the corpus as well as all accumulated income, declined to comply with that demand. Thereupon suit was brought in the name of the minor, by her father as next friend, in the federal court for the district in West Virginia in which the testator was residing at the time of his death, against the trustees to compel distribution of the income involved in accordance with the guardian's previous demand. That suit finally was decided in favor of the plaintiff, it being held that the guardian was entitled to receive from the trustees his ward's accumulated income and future income as it annually accrued. <i>Van Wart</i> v. <i>Jones,</i> 295 F. 287. Accordingly, in 1924 the trustees paid over to Dr. Van Wart as guardian the accumulated income of $160,000 and current income of $80,000; and Dr. Van Wart, acting as guardian and by authority of the court of his appointment, paid out of the funds so received by him a fee of $30,000 to the attorneys who brought the suit for their services in the litigation. In the income tax return for 1924, which was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> filed by the guardian on behalf of his ward, a deduction of the attorneys' fee was claimed.\"</p>\n<p>Pertinent provisions of the Revenue Act of 1924 are in the margin.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p>The Board of Tax Appeals held the attorney's fee was deductible as an ordinary and necessary expense in carrying on business. \u00a7 214 (a) (1). The Commissioner claimed it was personal expense of the minor taxpayer, excluded from deduction by \u00a7 215 (a) (1), and the court below upheld this view.
