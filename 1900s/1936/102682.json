It appears that appellant was held pursuant to conviction for violation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2</span> of \u00a7 2676 C.L. 1921, being \u00a7 40, c. 44, Session Laws 1913, of the laws of Colorado (see also \u00a7 2740 C.L. 1921, being \u00a7 85, c. 44 of Session Laws of 1913), the judgment of conviction having been affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. <i>Woolsey</i> v. <i>People,</i> 98 Colo. 62; 53 P. (2d) 596.</p>\n<p>It is well established that the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> cannot be used as a writ of error. This is the rule in Colorado as well as in this Court. The judgment of conviction was not subject to collateral attack. <i>People ex rel.

It is apparent from the record submitted that the state court had jurisdiction to try the appellant for violation of the statute in question and that any federal question properly raised as to the validity of the statute could have been heard and determined on appeal to this Court from the final judgment in that action. The Supreme Court of the State was not required by the Federal Constitution to entertain such questions on the subsequent petition for <i>habeas corpus,</i> and it does not appear that its denial of the petition did not rest upon an adequate non-federal ground. <i>Lynch</i> v. <i>New York,</i> 293 U.S. 52, and cases there cited.
