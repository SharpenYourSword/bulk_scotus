The judgment was affirmed (Century Indemnity Co. v. Nelson, 9 Cir., 90 F.2d 644) and certiorari was granted, 302 U.S. 674, 58 S.Ct. 55, 82 L.Ed. 520. We were unable to accept the conclusion of the Circuit Court of Appeals that when the trial court ordered 'that judgment be entered for plaintiff, with interest and costs, upon findings of fact and conclusions of law to be presented', it was thereafter 'too late adequately to present special findings of fact'. It was not necessary to treat the first order for judgment as ending 'the progress of the trial'. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 875, 28 U.S.C.A. &#167; 875. The qualifying words in the order were appropriate to suggest a 'reservation of opportunity for further action'. Accordingly, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals was reversed and the cause was remanded to that court for further proceedings in conformity with the opinion of this Court.
