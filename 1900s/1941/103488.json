Hormel, 111 F.2d 1, affirmed this day, 312 U.S. 552, 61 S.Ct. 719, 85 L.Ed. &#8212;-, we granted certiorari 'limited to the first question presented by the petition for the writ.' 311 U.S. 641, 61 S.Ct. 172, 85 L.Ed. &#8212;-. The petition stated that question as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The taxpayer transferred securities to a third party in trust to pay the income to his wife. At the end of five years, or earlier if the beneficiary consented, the securities were to be transferred back to the taxpayer. The Board of Tax Appeals held that the grantor was not taxable with respect to the income from the trust. Two questions are presented:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'1.

Int.Rev.Acts, page 669, that being an 'issue now for the first time presented by the Commissioner.' (114 F.2d 453.) The decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, which the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, was handed down prior to our decision in Helvering v. Clifford, 309 U.S. 331, 60 S.Ct. 554, 83 L.Ed. 788. Respondent urges that had he been advised with fair certainty that the government relied upon section 22(a), he could have introduced additional evidence directed to that issue. For reasons set out in our decision in Hormel v. Helvering, we are of opinion that the Circuit Court of Appeals was in error in its conclusion, but we are also of opinion that respondent is entitled to introduce additional evidence if he so desires.
