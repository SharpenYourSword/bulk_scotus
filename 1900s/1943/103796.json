Petitioner now alleges that he has filed an appeal from that court to the Supreme Court of Indiana. He also alleges that his request that a transcript of the coram nobis proceeding be furnished free of charge, because he is a poor person, has been denied. He contends that in the absence of a transcript of the coram nobis proceeding, he is left without a remedy by appeal in the courts of Indiana. But we cannot assume that the Supreme Court of Indiana will refuse to use its process to bring before it such parts of the record as may be necessary for a decision of the case, or that, in that event, it will refuse to enter an order finally disposing of the appeal. Until the Supreme Court of Indiana has acted upon an application for an order finally disposing of the appeal \u0097 which, if adverse to petitioner, he could make the subject of a petition for certiorari to this Court \u0097 the remedies afforded by state appellate procedure have not been fully exhausted. Accordingly, we deny petitioner's present application without prejudice.</p>\n<p><i>Leave denied.</i></p>\n</div>",
