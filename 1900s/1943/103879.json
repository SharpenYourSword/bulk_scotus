After the case went back to the Circuit Court of Appeals on mandate and further steps not necessary here to recount were taken, the relator filed a petition for a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in the District Court which, with supporting affidavits, adequately raised the issue whether in fact he intelligently \u0097 with full knowledge of his rights and capacity to understand them \u0097 waived his right to the assistance of counsel and to trial by jury. That issue, as appears from our former opinion, was explicitly withdrawn from consideration on the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings previously before the Circuit Court of Appeals. 126 F.2d 774. That issue, now fairly tendered by the petition for <i>habeas corpus</i> below, has never been adjudicated on its merits by the lower courts. But it is no longer within the bosom of the trial court. Nor can it be disposed of on the appeal of his conviction, for the claim rests on materials <i>dehors</i> the trial proceedings. It is a claim which the relator should be allowed to establish, if he can. We cannot say that, in the light of the supporting affidavits, the petition for a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> was palpably unmeritorious, and should have been dismissed without more.

In these cases petitioners invoke the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.C. sections 377,<br>[220]<br>451, 28 U.S.C.A. &#167;&#167; 377, 451, to issue writs of habeas corpus in aid of its appellate jurisdiction. Cf. Ex parte Peru, 318 U.S. 578, 582, 583, 63 S.Ct. 793, 796, 87 L.Ed. 1014. That jurisdiction is discretionary, 318 U.S. 584, 63 S.Ct. 797, 87 L.Ed. 1014; Bowen<br>v.<br>Johnston, 306 U.S. 19, 27, 59 S.Ct. 442, 446, 83 L.Ed. 455, and this Court does not, save in exceptional circumstances, exercise it in cases where an adequate remedy may be had in a lower federal court, Ex parte Current, 314 U.S. 578, 62 S.Ct. 120, 86 L.Ed. 467; Ex parte Spaulding, 317 U.S. 593, 63 S.Ct. 69, 87 L.Ed. 486; Ex parte Hawk, 318 U.S. 746, 63 S.Ct. 979, 87 L.Ed. 1123, or, if the relief sought is from the judgment of a state court, where the petitioner has not exhausted his remedies in the state courts, Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103, 115, 55 S.Ct. 340, 343, 79 L.Ed. 791, 98 A.L.R. 406; Ex parte Botwinski, 314 U.S. 586, 62 S.Ct. 476, 86 L.Ed. 473; Ex parte Davis, 317 U.S. 592, 63 S.Ct. 26, 87 L.Ed. 484; Id., 318 U.S. 412, 63 S.Ct. 679, 87 L.Ed. 868; Ex parte Williams, 317 U.S. 604, 63 S.Ct. 431, 87 L.Ed. 491.
