Clark,</i> and <i>Messrs. Oscar A. Provost, Edward G. Jennings,</i> and <i>Valentine Brookes</i> were on the brief, for the United States.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*278</span> <i>Mr. Samuel M. Fleischman,</i> with whom <i>Mr. Robert J. Whissel</i> was on the brief, for respondent.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This was a prosecution begun by two informations, consolidated for trial, charging Buffalo Pharmacal Company, Inc., and Dotterweich, its president and general manager, with violations of the Act of Congress of June 25, 1938, c. 675, 52 Stat. 1040, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301-392, known as the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Company, a jobber in drugs, purchased them from their manufacturers and shipped them, repacked under its own label, in interstate commerce. (No question is raised in this case regarding the implications that may properly arise when, although the manufacturer gives the jobber a guaranty, the latter through his own label makes representations.) The informations were based on \u00a7 301 of that Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331), paragraph (a) of which prohibits \"The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any . . . drug . . . that is adulterated or misbranded.\" \"Any person\" violating this provision is, by paragraph (a) of \u00a7 303 (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 333), made \"guilty of a misdemeanor.\" Three counts went to the jury \u0097 two, for shipping misbranded drugs in interstate commerce, and a third, for so shipping an adulterated drug. The jury disagreed as to the corporation and found Dotterweich guilty on all three counts. We start with the finding of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the evidence was adequate to support the verdict of adulteration and misbranding. 131 F.2d 500, 502.</p>\n<p>Two other questions which the Circuit Court of Appeals decided against Dotterweich call only for summary disposition to clear the path for the main question before us. He invoked \u00a7 305 of the Act requiring the Administrator, before reporting a violation for prosecution by a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*279</span> United States attorney, to give the suspect an \"opportunity to present his views.\" We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that the giving of such an opportunity, which was not accorded to Dotterweich, is not a prerequisite to prosecution. This Court so held in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morgan,</i> 222 U.S. 274, in construing the Food and Drugs Act of 1906, 34 Stat. 768, and the legislative history to which the court below called attention abundantly proves that Congress, in the changed phraseology of 1938, did not intend to introduce a change of substance. 83 Cong. Rec. 7792-94. Equally baseless is the claim of Dotterweich that, having failed to find the corporation guilty, the jury could not find him guilty. Whether the jury's verdict was the result of carelessness or compromise or a belief that the responsible individual should suffer the penalty instead of merely increasing, as it were, the cost of running the business of the corporation, is immaterial. Juries may indulge in precisely such motives or vagaries. <i>Dunn</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 284 U.S. 390.</p>\n<p>And so we are brought to our real problem. The Circuit Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, reversed the conviction on the ground that only the corporation was the \"person\" subject to prosecution unless, perchance, Buffalo Pharmacal was a counterfeit corporation serving as a screen for Dotterweich. On that issue, after rehearing, it remanded the cause for a new trial. We then brought the case here, on the Government's petition for certiorari, 318 U.S. 753, because this construction raised questions of importance in the enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</p>\n<p>The court below drew its conclusion not from the provisions defining the offenses on which this prosecution was based (\u00a7\u00a7 301 (a) and 303 (a)), but from the terms of \u00a7 303 (c). That section affords immunity from prosecution if certain conditions are satisfied. The condition relevant to this case is a guaranty from the seller of the innocence of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*280</span> his product. So far as here relevant, the provision for an immunizing guaranty is as follows:</p>\n<p>\"No person shall be subject to the penalties of subsection (a) of this section . . . (2) for having violated section 301 (a) or (d), if he establishes a guaranty or undertaking signed by, and containing the name and address of, the person residing in the United States from whom he received in good faith the article, to the effect, in case of an alleged violation of section 301 (a), that such article is not adulterated or misbranded, within the meaning of this Act, designating this Act . . .\"</p>\n<p>The Circuit Court of Appeals found it \"difficult to believe that Congress expected anyone except the principal to get such a guaranty, or to make the guilt of an agent depend upon whether his employer had gotten one.\" 131 F.2d 500, 503. And so it cut down the scope of the penalizing provisions of the Act to the restrictive view, as a matter of language and policy, it took of the relieving effect of a guaranty.</p>\n<p>The guaranty clause cannot be read in isolation. The Food and Drugs Act of 1906 was an exertion by Congress of its power to keep impure and adulterated food and drugs out of the channels of commerce. By the Act of 1938, Congress extended the range of its control over illicit and noxious articles and stiffened the penalties for disobedience. The purposes of this legislation thus touch phases of the lives and health of people which, in the circumstances of modern industrialism, are largely beyond self-protection. Regard for these purposes should infuse construction of the legislation if it is to be treated as a working instrument of government and not merely as a collection of English words. See <i>Hipolite Egg Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 220 U.S. 45, 57, and <i>McDermott</i> v. <i>Wisconsin,</i> 228 U.S. 115, 128. The prosecution to which Dotterweich was subjected is based on a now familiar type of legislation whereby penalties serve as effective means <span class=\"star-pagination\">*281</span> of regulation. Such legislation dispenses with the conventional requirement for criminal conduct \u0097 awareness of some wrongdoing. In the interest of the larger good it puts the burden of acting at hazard upon a person otherwise innocent but standing in responsible relation to a public danger. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Balint,</i> 258 U.S. 250. And so it is clear that shipments like those now in issue are \"punished by the statute if the article is misbranded [or adulterated], and that the article may be misbranded [or adulterated] without any conscious fraud at all. It was natural enough to throw this risk on shippers with regard to the identity of their wares . . .\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Johnson,</i> 221 U.S. 488, 497-98.</p>\n<p>The statute makes \"any person\" who violates \u00a7 301 (a) guilty of a \"misdemeanor.\" It specifically defines \"person\" to include \"corporation.\" \u00a7 201 (e). But the only way in which a corporation can act is through the individuals who act on its behalf. <i>New York Central &amp; H.R.R. Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 212 U.S. 481. And the historic conception of a \"misdemeanor\" makes all those responsible for it equally guilty, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Mills,</i> 7 Pet. 138, 141, a doctrine given general application in \u00a7 332 of the Penal Code (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 550). If, then, Dotterweich is not subject to the Act, it must be solely on the ground that individuals are immune when the \"person\" who violates \u00a7 301 (a) is a corporation, although from the point of view of action the individuals are the corporation. As a matter of legal development, it has taken time to establish criminal liability also for a corporation and not merely for its agents. See <i>New York Central &amp; H.R.R. Co.</i> v. <i>United States, supra</i><i>.</i> The history of federal food and drug legislation is a good illustration of the elaborate phrasing that was in earlier days deemed necessary to fasten criminal liability on corporations. Section 12 of the Food and Drugs Act of 1906 provided that, \"the act, omission, or failure of any officer, agent, or other person <span class=\"star-pagination\">*282</span> acting for or employed by any corporation, company, society, or association, within the scope of his employment or office, shall in every case be also deemed to be the act, omission, or failure of such corporation, company, society, or association as well as that of the person.\" By 1938, legal understanding and practice had rendered such statement of the obvious superfluous. Deletion of words \u0097 in the interest of brevity and good draftsmanship<sup>[1]</sup> \u0097 superfluous for holding a corporation criminally liable can hardly be found ground for relieving from such liability the individual agents of the corporation. To hold that the Act of 1938 freed all individuals, except when proprietors, from the culpability under which the earlier legislation had placed them is to defeat the very object of the new Act. Nothing is clearer than that the later legislation was designed to enlarge and stiffen the penal net and not to narrow and loosen it. This purpose was unequivocally avowed by the two committees which reported the bills to the Congress. The House Committee reported that the Act \"seeks to set up effective provisions against abuses of consumer welfare growing out of inadequacies in the Food and Drugs Act of June 30, 1906.\" (H. Rep. No. 2139, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 1.) And the Senate Committee explicitly pointed out that the new legislation \"must not weaken the existing laws,\" but on the contrary \"it must strengthen and extend that law's protection of the consumer.\" (S. Rep. No. 152, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1.) If the 1938 Act were construed as it was below, the penalties of the law could be imposed only in the rare case where the corporation is merely an individual's <i>alter ego.</i> Corporations carrying on an illicit trade would be subject only to what the House Committee described as a \"license fee <span class=\"star-pagination\">*283</span> for the conduct of an illegitimate business.\"<sup>[2]</sup> A corporate officer, who even with \"intent to defraud or mislead\" (\u00a7 303b), introduced adulterated or misbranded drugs into interstate commerce could not be held culpable for conduct which was indubitably outlawed by the 1906 Act. See, e.g., <i>United States</i> v. <i>Mayfield,</i> 177 F. 765. This argument proves too much. It is not credible that Congress should by implication have exonerated what is probably a preponderant number of persons involved in acts of disobedience \u0097 for the number of non-corporate proprietors is relatively small. Congress, of course, could reverse the process and hold only the corporation and allow its agents to escape. In very exceptional circumstances it may have required this result. See <i>Sherman</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 282 U.S. 25. But the history of the present Act, its purposes, its terms, and extended practical construction lead away from such a result once \"we free our minds from the notion that criminal statutes must be construed by some artificial and conventional rule.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Union Supply Co.,</i> 215 U.S. 50, 55.</p>\n<p>The Act is concerned not with the proprietory relation to a misbranded or an adulterated drug but with its distribution. In the case of a corporation such distribution must be accomplished, and may be furthered, by persons standing in various relations to the incorporeal proprietor. If a guaranty immunizes shipments of course it immunizes all involved in the shipment. But simply because if there had been a guaranty it would have been received by the proprietor, whether corporate or individual, as a safeguard for the enterprise, the want of a guaranty <span class=\"star-pagination\">*284</span> does not cut down the scope of responsibility of all who are concerned with transactions forbidden by \u00a7 301. To be sure, that casts the risk that there is no guaranty upon all who according to settled doctrines of criminal law are responsible for the commission of a misdemeanor. To read the guaranty section, as did the court below, so as to restrict liability for penalties to the only person who normally would receive a guaranty \u0097 the proprietor \u0097 disregards the admonition that \"the meaning of a sentence is to be felt rather than to be proved.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Johnson,</i> 221 U.S. 488, 496. It also reads an exception to an important provision safeguarding the public welfare with a liberality which more appropriately belongs to enforcement of the central purpose of the Act.</p>\n<p>The Circuit Court of Appeals was evidently tempted to make such a devitalizing use of the guaranty provision through fear that an enforcement of \u00a7 301 (a) as written might operate too harshly by sweeping within its condemnation any person however remotely entangled in the proscribed shipment. But that is not the way to read legislation. Literalism and evisceration are equally to be avoided. To speak with technical accuracy, under \u00a7 301 a corporation may commit an offense and all persons who aid and abet its commission are equally guilty. Whether an accused shares responsibility in the business process resulting in unlawful distribution depends on the evidence produced at the trial and its submission \u0097 assuming the evidence warrants it \u0097 to the jury under appropriate guidance. The offense is committed, unless the enterprise which they are serving enjoys the immunity of a guaranty, by all who do have such a responsible share in the furtherance of the transaction which the statute outlaws, namely, to put into the stream of interstate commerce adulterated or misbranded drugs. Hardship there doubtless may be under a statute which thus penalizes the transaction though consciousness of wrongdoing be totally wanting. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*285</span> Balancing relative hardships, Congress has preferred to place it upon those who have at least the opportunity of informing themselves of the existence of conditions imposed for the protection of consumers before sharing in illicit commerce, rather than to throw the hazard on the innocent public who are wholly helpless.</p>\n<p>It would be too treacherous to define or even to indicate by way of illustration the class of employees which stands in such a responsible relation. To attempt a formula embracing the variety of conduct whereby persons may responsibly contribute in furthering a transaction forbidden by an Act of Congress, to wit, to send illicit goods across state lines, would be mischievous futility. In such matters the good sense of prosecutors, the wise guidance of trial judges, and the ultimate judgment of juries must be trusted. Our system of criminal justice necessarily depends on \"conscience and circumspection in prosecuting officers,\" <i>Nash</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 229 U.S. 373, 378, even when the consequences are far more drastic than they are under the provision of law before us. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Balint, supra</i> (involving a maximum sentence of five years). For present purpose it suffices to say that in what the defense characterized as \"a very fair charge\" the District Court properly left the question of the responsibility of Dotterweich for the shipment to the jury, and there was sufficient evidence to support its verdict.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE MURPHY, dissenting:</p>\n<p>Our prime concern in this case is whether the criminal sanctions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 plainly and unmistakably apply to the respondent in his capacity as a corporate officer. He is charged with violating \u00a7 301 (a) of the Act, which prohibits the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any adulterated or misbranded drug. There is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*286</span> no evidence in this case of any personal guilt on the part of the respondent. There is no proof or claim that he ever knew of the introduction into commerce of the adulterated drugs in question, much less that he actively participated in their introduction. Guilt is imputed to the respondent solely on the basis of his authority and responsibility as president and general manager of the corporation.</p>\n<p>It is a fundamental principle of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence that guilt is personal and that it ought not lightly to be imputed to a citizen who, like the respondent, has no evil intention or consciousness of wrongdoing. It may be proper to charge him with responsibility to the corporation and the stockholders for negligence and mismanagement. But in the absence of clear statutory authorization it is inconsistent with established canons of criminal law to rest liability on an act in which the accused did not participate and of which he had no personal knowledge. Before we place the stigma of a criminal conviction upon any such citizen the legislative mandate must be clear and unambiguous. Accordingly that which Chief Justice Marshall has called \"the tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals\"<sup>[1]</sup> entitles each person, regardless of economic or social status, to an unequivocal warning from the legislature as to whether he is within the class of persons subject to vicarious liability. Congress cannot be deemed to have intended to punish anyone who is not \"plainly and unmistakably\" within the confines of the statute. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lacher,</i> 134 U.S. 624, 628; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Gradwell,</i> 243 U.S. 476, 485.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the fact that individual liability of corporate officers may be consistent with the policy and purpose of a public health and welfare measure does not authorize this Court to impose such liability where Congress has not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*287</span> clearly intended or actually done so. Congress alone has the power to define a crime and to specify the offenders. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Wiltberger,</i> 5 Wheat. 76, 95. It is not our function to supply any deficiencies in these respects, no matter how grave the consequences. Statutory policy and purpose are not constitutional substitutes for the requirement that the legislature specify with reasonable certainty those individuals it desires to place under the interdict of the Act. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Harris,</i> 177 U.S. 305; <i>Sarlls</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 152 U.S. 570.</p>\n<p>Looking at the language actually used in this statute, we find a complete absence of any reference to corporate officers. There is merely a provision in \u00a7 303 (a) to the effect that \"any person\" inadvertently violating \u00a7 301 (a) shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Section 201 (e) further defines \"person\" as including an \"individual, partnership, corporation, and association.\"<sup>[2]</sup> The fact that a corporate officer is both a \"person\" and an \"individual\" is not indicative of an intent to place vicarious liability on the officer. Such words must be read in light of their statutory environment.<sup>[3]</sup> Only if Congress has otherwise specified an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*288</span> intent to place corporate officers within the ambit of the Act can they be said to be embraced within the meaning of the words \"person\" or \"individual\" as here used.</p>\n<p>Nor does the clear imposition of liability on corporations reveal the necessary intent to place criminal sanctions on their officers. A corporation is not the necessary and inevitable equivalent of its officers for all purposes.<sup>[4]</sup> In many respects it is desirable to distinguish the latter from the corporate entity and to impose liability only on the corporation. In this respect it is significant that this Court has never held the imposition of liability on a corporation sufficient, without more, to extend liability to its officers who have no consciousness of wrongdoing.<sup>[5]</sup> Indeed, in a closely analogous situation, we have held that the vicarious personal liability of receivers in actual charge and control of a corporation could not be predicated on the statutory liability of a \"company,\" even when the policy and purpose of the enactment were consistent with personal liability. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Harris, supra.</i><sup></sup>[6] It follows <span class=\"star-pagination\">*289</span> that express statutory provisions are necessary to satisfy the requirement that officers as individuals be given clear and unmistakable warning as to their vicarious personal liability. This Act gives no such warning.</p>\n<p>This fatal hiatus in the Act is further emphasized by the ability of Congress, demonstrated on many occasions, to apply statutes in no uncertain terms to corporate officers as distinct from corporations.<sup>[7]</sup> The failure to mention officers specifically is thus some indication of a desire to exempt them from liability. In fact the history <span class=\"star-pagination\">*290</span> of federal food and drug legislation is itself illustrative of this capacity for specification and lends strong support to the conclusion that Congress did not intend to impose liability on corporate officers in this particular Act.</p>\n<p>Section 2 of the Federal Food and Drugs Act of 1906, as introduced and passed in the Senate, contained a provision to the effect that any violation of the Act by a corporation should be deemed to be the act of the officer responsible therefor and that such officer might be punished as though it were his personal act.<sup>[8]</sup> This clear imposition of criminal responsibility on corporate officers, however, was not carried over into the statute as finally enacted. In its place appeared merely the provision that \"when construing and enforcing the provisions of this Act, the act, omission, or failure of any officer, agent, or other person acting for or employed by any corporation . . . within the scope of his employment or office, shall in every case be also deemed to be the act, omission, or failure of such corporation . . . as well as that of the person.\"<sup>[9]</sup> This provision had the effect only of making corporations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*291</span> responsible for the illegal acts of their officers and proved unnecessary in view of the clarity of the law to that effect. <i>New York Central &amp; H.R.R. Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 212 U.S. 481.</p>\n<p>The framers of the 1938 Act were aware that the 1906 Act was deficient in that it failed \"to place responsibility properly upon corporate officers.\"<sup>[10]</sup> In order \"to provide the additional scope necessary to prevent the use of the corporate form as a shield to individual wrongdoers,\"<sup>[11]</sup> these framers inserted a clear provision that \"whenever a corporation or association violates any of the provisions of this Act, such violation shall also be deemed to be a violation of the individual directors, officers, or agents of such corporation or association who authorized, ordered, or did any of the acts constituting, in whole or in part, such violation.\"<sup>[12]</sup> This paragraph, however, was deleted from the final version of the Act.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*292</span> We cannot presume that this omission was inadvertent on the part of Congress. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Harris, supra</i> at 309. Even if it were, courts have no power to remedy so serious a defect, no matter how probable it otherwise may appear that Congress intended to include officers; \"probability is not a guide which a court, in construing a penal statute, can safely take.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Wiltberger, supra</i> at 105. But the framers of the 1938 Act had an intelligent comprehension of the inadequacies of the 1906 Act and of the unsettled state of the law. They recognized the necessity of inserting clear and unmistakable language in order to impose liability on corporate officers. It is thus unreasonable to assume that the omission of such language was due to a belief that the Act as it now stands was sufficient to impose liability on corporate officers. Such deliberate deletion is consistent only with an intent to allow such officers to remain free from criminal liability. Thus to apply the sanctions of this Act to the respondent would be contrary to the intent of Congress as expressed in the statutory language and in the legislative history.</p>\n<p>The dangers inherent in any attempt to create liability without express Congressional intention or authorization are illustrated by this case. Without any legislative guides, we are confronted with the problem of determining precisely which officers, employees and agents of a corporation are to be subject to this Act by our fiat. To erect standards of responsibility is a difficult legislative task and the opinion of this Court admits that it is \"too treacherous\" and a \"mischievous futility\" for us to engage in such pursuits. But the only alternative is a blind resort to \"the good sense of prosecutors, the wise guidance of trial judges, and the ultimate judgment of juries.\" Yet that situation is precisely what our constitutional system sought to avoid. Reliance on the legislature to define crimes and criminals distinguishes our form of jurisprudence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*293</span> from certain less desirable ones. The legislative power to restrain the liberty and to imperil the good reputation of citizens must not rest upon the variable attitudes and opinions of those charged with the duties of interpreting and enforcing the mandates of the law. I therefore cannot approve the decision of the Court in this case.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS, MR. JUSTICE REED and MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE join in this dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  \"The bill has been made shorter and less verbose than previous bills. That has been done without deleting any effective provisions.\" S. Rep. No. 152, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 2.</p>\n<p>[2]  In describing the penalty provisions of \u00a7 303, the House Committee reported that the Bill \"increases substantially the criminal penalties . . . which some manufacturers have regarded as substantially a license fee for the conduct of an illegitimate business.\" H. Rep. No. 2139, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 4.</p>\n<p>[1]  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Wiltberger,</i> 5 Wheat. 76, 95.</p>\n<p>[2]  The normal and necessary meaning of such a definition of \"person\" is to distinguish between individual enterprises and those enterprises that are incorporated or operated as a partnership or association, in order to subject them all to the Act. This phrase cannot be considered as an attempt to distinguish between individual officers of a corporation and the corporate entity. Lee, \"Corporate Criminal Liability,\" 28 Col. L. Rev. 1, 181, 190.</p>\n<p>[3]  Compare <i>United States</i> v. <i>Cooper Corp.,</i> 312 U.S. 600, 606, and <i>Davis</i> v. <i>Pringle,</i> 268 U.S. 315, 318, holding that the context and legislative history of the particular statutes there involved indicated that the words \"any person\" did not include the United States. But in <i>Georgia</i> v. <i>Evans,</i> 316 U.S. 159, and <i>Ohio</i> v. <i>Helvering,</i> 292 U.S. 360, these considerations led to the conclusion that \"any person\" did include a state. See also 40 Stat. 1143, which specifically includes officers within the meaning of \"any person\" as used in the Revenue Act of 1918.</p>\n<p>[4]  In <i>Park Bank</i> v. <i>Remsen,</i> 158 U.S. 337, 344, this Court said, \"It is the corporation which is given the powers and privileges and made subject to the liabilities. Does this carry with it an imposition of liability upon the trustee or other officer of the corporation? The officer is not the corporation; his liability is personal, and not that of the corporation, nor can it be counted among the powers and privileges of the corporation.\"</p>\n<p>[5]  For an analysis of the confusion on this matter in the state and lower federal courts, see Lee, \"Corporate Criminal Liability,\" 28 Col. L. Rev. 1, 181.</p>\n<p>[6]  In that case we had before us Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 4386-4389, which penalized \"any company, owner or custodian of such animals\" who failed to comply with the statutory requirements as to livestock transportation. A railroad company violated the statute and the government sought to impose liability on the receivers who were in actual charge of the company. It was argued that the word \"company\" embraced the natural persons acting on behalf of the company and that to hold such officers and receivers liable was within the policy and purpose of so humane a statute. We rejected this contention in language peculiarly appropriate to this case (177 U.S. at 309):\n</p>\n<p>\"It must be admitted that, in order to hold the receivers, they must be regarded as included in the word `company.' Only by a strained and artificial construction, based chiefly upon a consideration of the mischief which the legislature sought to remedy, can receivers be brought within the terms of the law. But can such a kind of construction be resorted to in enforcing a penal statute? Giving all proper force to the contention of the counsel of the Government, that there has been some relaxation on the part of the courts in applying the rule of strict construction to such statutes, it still remains that the intention of a penal statute must be found in the language actually used, interpreted according to its fair and obvious meaning. It is not permitted to courts, in this class of cases, to attribute inadvertence or oversight to the legislature when enumerating the classes of persons who are subjected to a penal enactment, nor to depart from the settled meaning of words or phrases in order to bring persons not named or distinctly described within the supposed purpose of the statute.\"</p>\n<p>[7]  \"Whenever a corporation shall violate any of the penal provisions of the antitrust laws, such violation shall be deemed to be also that of the individual directors, officers, or agents of such corporation who shall have authorized, ordered, or done any of the acts constituting in whole or in part such violation.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 24.\n</p>\n<p>\"The courts of bankruptcy . . . are hereby invested . . . with such jurisdiction at law and in equity as will enable them to . .. (4) arraign, try, and punish bankrupts, officers, and other persons, and the agents, officers, members of the board of directors or trustees, or other similar controlling bodies, of corporations for violations of this Act.\" 30 Stat. 545.</p>\n<p>\"Any such common carrier, or any officer or agent thereof, requiring or permitting any employee to go, be, or remain on duty in violation of the next preceding section of this chapter shall be liable to a penalty . . .\" 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 63.</p>\n<p>\"A mortgagor who, with intent to defraud, violates any provision of subsection F, section 924, and if the mortgagor is a corporation or association, the president or other principal executive officer of the corporation or association, shall upon conviction thereof be held guilty of a misdemeanor . . .\" 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 941 (b).</p>\n<p>[8]  S. 88, 59th Cong., 1st Sess. Senator Heyburn, one of the sponsors of S. 88, stated that this was \"a new feature in bills of this kind. It was intended to obviate the possibility of escape by the officers of a corporation under a plea, which has been more than once made, that they did not know that this was being done on the credit of or on the responsibility of the corporation.\" 40 Cong. Rec. 894.</p>\n<p>[9]  34 Stat. 772, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p>[10]  Senate Report No. 493, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 21.</p>\n<p>[11]  <i>Ibid.,</i> p. 22. This report also stated that \"it is not, however, the purpose of this paragraph to subject to liability those directors, officers, and employees, who merely authorize their subordinates to perform lawful duties and such subordinates, on their own initiative, perform those duties in a manner which violates the provisions of the law. However, if a director or officer personally orders his subordinate to do an act in violation of the law, there is no reason why he should be shielded from personal responsibility merely because the act was done by another and on behalf of a corporation.\"</p>\n<p>[12]  This provision appears in several of the early versions of the Act introduced in Congress. S. 1944, 73d Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7 18 (b); S. 2000, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7 18 (b); S. 2800, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7 18 (b); S. 5, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7 709 (b); S. 5, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7 707 (b), as reported to the House, which substituted the word \"personally\" for the word \"authorized\" in the last clause of the paragraph quoted above. A variation of this provision appeared in S. 5, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7 2 (f), and made a marked distinction between the use of the word \"person\" and the words \"director, officer, employee, or agent acting for or employed by any person.\" All of these bills also contained the present definition of \"person\" as including \"individual, partnership, corporation, and association.\"</p>\n\n</div>",

Jennings,</i> and <i>Valentine Brookes</i> were on the brief, for the United States.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*278</span> <i>Mr. Samuel M. Fleischman,</i> with whom <i>Mr. Robert J. Whissel</i> was on the brief, for respondent.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This was a prosecution begun by two informations, consolidated for trial, charging Buffalo Pharmacal Company, Inc., and Dotterweich, its president and general manager, with violations of the Act of Congress of June 25, 1938, c. 675, 52 Stat. 1040, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301-392, known as the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Company, a jobber in drugs, purchased them from their manufacturers and shipped them, repacked under its own label, in interstate commerce. (No question is raised in this case regarding the implications that may properly arise when, although the manufacturer gives the jobber a guaranty, the latter through his own label makes representations.) The informations were based on \u00a7 301 of that Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331), paragraph (a) of which prohibits \"The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any . . . drug . . . that is adulterated or misbranded.\" \"Any person\" violating this provision is, by paragraph (a) of \u00a7 303 (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 333), made \"guilty of a misdemeanor.\" Three counts went to the jury \u0097 two, for shipping misbranded drugs in interstate commerce, and a third, for so shipping an adulterated drug. The jury disagreed as to the corporation and found Dotterweich guilty on all three counts. We start with the finding of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the evidence was adequate to support the verdict of adulteration and misbranding. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1511986\"><a href=\"/opinion/1511986/united-states-v-buffalo-pharmacal-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span>, 502.</p>\n<p>Two other questions which the Circuit Court of Appeals decided against Dotterweich call only for summary disposition to clear the path for the main question before us. He invoked \u00a7 305 of the Act requiring the Administrator, before reporting a violation for prosecution by a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*279</span> United States attorney, to give the suspect an \"opportunity to present his views.\" We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that the giving of such an opportunity, which was not accorded to Dotterweich, is not a prerequisite to prosecution. This Court so held in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morgan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97496\"><a href=\"/opinion/97496/united-states-v-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, in construing the Food and Drugs Act of 1906, 34 Stat. 768, and the legislative history to which the court below called attention abundantly proves that Congress, in the changed phraseology of 1938, did not intend to introduce a change of substance. 83 Cong. Rec. 7792-94. Equally baseless is the claim of Dotterweich that, having failed to find the corporation guilty, the jury could not find him guilty. Whether the jury's verdict was the result of carelessness or compromise or a belief that the responsible individual should suffer the penalty instead of merely increasing, as it were, the cost of running the business of the corporation, is immaterial. Juries may indulge in precisely such motives or vagaries. <i>Dunn</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 284 U.S. 390.</p>\n<p>And so we are brought to our real problem. The Circuit Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, reversed the conviction on the ground that only the corporation was the \"person\" subject to prosecution unless, perchance, Buffalo Pharmacal was a counterfeit corporation serving as a screen for Dotterweich. On that issue, after rehearing, it remanded the cause for a new trial. We then brought the case here, on the Government's petition for certiorari, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></span>, because this construction raised questions of importance in the enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</p>\n<p>The court below drew its conclusion not from the provisions defining the offenses on which this prosecution was based (\u00a7\u00a7 301 (a) and 303 (a)), but from the terms of \u00a7 303 (c). That section affords immunity from prosecution if certain conditions are satisfied. The condition relevant to this case is a guaranty from the seller of the innocence of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*280</span> his product. So far as here relevant, the provision for an immunizing guaranty is as follows:</p>\n<p>\"No person shall be subject to the penalties of subsection (a) of this section . . . (2) for having violated section 301 (a) or (d), if he establishes a guaranty or undertaking signed by, and containing the name and address of, the person residing in the United States from whom he received in good faith the article, to the effect, in case of an alleged violation of section 301 (a), that such article is not adulterated or misbranded, within the meaning of this Act, designating this Act . . .\"</p>\n<p>The Circuit Court of Appeals found it \"difficult to believe that Congress expected anyone except the principal to get such a guaranty, or to make the guilt of an agent depend upon whether his employer had gotten one.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1511986\"><a href=\"/opinion/1511986/united-states-v-buffalo-pharmacal-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span>, 503. And so it cut down the scope of the penalizing provisions of the Act to the restrictive view, as a matter of language and policy, it took of the relieving effect of a guaranty.</p>\n<p>The guaranty clause cannot be read in isolation. The Food and Drugs Act of 1906 was an exertion by Congress of its power to keep impure and adulterated food and drugs out of the channels of commerce. By the Act of 1938, Congress extended the range of its control over illicit and noxious articles and stiffened the penalties for disobedience. The purposes of this legislation thus touch phases of the lives and health of people which, in the circumstances of modern industrialism, are largely beyond self-protection. Regard for these purposes should infuse construction of the legislation if it is to be treated as a working instrument of government and not merely as a collection of English words. See <i>Hipolite Egg Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97373\"><a href=\"/opinion/97373/hipolite-egg-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 57, and <i>McDermott</i> v. <i>Wisconsin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97835\"><a href=\"/opinion/97835/mcdermott-v-wisconsin/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 128. The prosecution to which Dotterweich was subjected is based on a now familiar type of legislation whereby penalties serve as effective means <span class=\"star-pagination\">*281</span> of regulation. Such legislation dispenses with the conventional requirement for criminal conduct \u0097 awareness of some wrongdoing. In the interest of the larger good it puts the burden of acting at hazard upon a person otherwise innocent but standing in responsible relation to a public danger. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Balint,</i> 258 U.S. 250. And so it is clear that shipments like those now in issue are \"punished by the statute if the article is misbranded [or adulterated], and that the article may be misbranded [or adulterated] without any conscious fraud at all. It was natural enough to throw this risk on shippers with regard to the identity of their wares . . .\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97441\"><a href=\"/opinion/97441/united-states-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span>, 497-98.</p>\n<p>The statute makes \"any person\" who violates \u00a7 301 (a) guilty of a \"misdemeanor.\" It specifically defines \"person\" to include \"corporation.\" \u00a7 201 (e). But the only way in which a corporation can act is through the individuals who act on its behalf. <i>New York Central &amp; H.R.R. Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 212 U.S. 481. And the historic conception of a \"misdemeanor\" makes all those responsible for it equally guilty, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Mills,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></span>, 141, a doctrine given general application in \u00a7 332 of the Penal Code (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 550). If, then, Dotterweich is not subject to the Act, it must be solely on the ground that individuals are immune when the \"person\" who violates \u00a7 301 (a) is a corporation, although from the point of view of action the individuals are the corporation. As a matter of legal development, it has taken time to establish criminal liability also for a corporation and not merely for its agents. See <i>New York Central &amp; H.R.R. Co.</i> v. <i>United States, supra</i><i>.</i> The history of federal food and drug legislation is a good illustration of the elaborate phrasing that was in earlier days deemed necessary to fasten criminal liability on corporations. Section 12 of the Food and Drugs Act of 1906 provided that, \"the act, omission, or failure of any officer, agent, or other person <span class=\"star-pagination\">*282</span> acting for or employed by any corporation, company, society, or association, within the scope of his employment or office, shall in every case be also deemed to be the act, omission, or failure of such corporation, company, society, or association as well as that of the person.\" By 1938, legal understanding and practice had rendered such statement of the obvious superfluous. Deletion of words \u0097 in the interest of brevity and good draftsmanship<sup>[1]</sup> \u0097 superfluous for holding a corporation criminally liable can hardly be found ground for relieving from such liability the individual agents of the corporation. To hold that the Act of 1938 freed all individuals, except when proprietors, from the culpability under which the earlier legislation had placed them is to defeat the very object of the new Act. Nothing is clearer than that the later legislation was designed to enlarge and stiffen the penal net and not to narrow and loosen it. This purpose was unequivocally avowed by the two committees which reported the bills to the Congress. The House Committee reported that the Act \"seeks to set up effective provisions against abuses of consumer welfare growing out of inadequacies in the Food and Drugs Act of June 30, 1906.\" (H. Rep. No. 2139, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 1.) And the Senate Committee explicitly pointed out that the new legislation \"must not weaken the existing laws,\" but on the contrary \"it must strengthen and extend that law's protection of the consumer.\" (S. Rep. No. 152, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1.) If the 1938 Act were construed as it was below, the penalties of the law could be imposed only in the rare case where the corporation is merely an individual's <i>alter ego.</i> Corporations carrying on an illicit trade would be subject only to what the House Committee described as a \"license fee <span class=\"star-pagination\">*283</span> for the conduct of an illegitimate business.\"<sup>[2]</sup> A corporate officer, who even with \"intent to defraud or mislead\" (\u00a7 303b), introduced adulterated or misbranded drugs into interstate commerce could not be held culpable for conduct which was indubitably outlawed by the 1906 Act. See, e.g., <i>United States</i> v. <i>Mayfield,</i> 177 F. 765. This argument proves too much. It is not credible that Congress should by implication have exonerated what is probably a preponderant number of persons involved in acts of disobedience \u0097 for the number of non-corporate proprietors is relatively small. Congress, of course, could reverse the process and hold only the corporation and allow its agents to escape. In very exceptional circumstances it may have required this result. See <i>Sherman</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 282 U.S. 25. But the history of the present Act, its purposes, its terms, and extended practical construction lead away from such a result once \"we free our minds from the notion that criminal statutes must be construed by some artificial and conventional rule.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Union Supply Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97088\"><a href=\"/opinion/97088/united-states-v-union-supply-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 55.</p>\n<p>The Act is concerned not with the proprietory relation to a misbranded or an adulterated drug but with its distribution. In the case of a corporation such distribution must be accomplished, and may be furthered, by persons standing in various relations to the incorporeal proprietor. If a guaranty immunizes shipments of course it immunizes all involved in the shipment. But simply because if there had been a guaranty it would have been received by the proprietor, whether corporate or individual, as a safeguard for the enterprise, the want of a guaranty <span class=\"star-pagination\">*284</span> does not cut down the scope of responsibility of all who are concerned with transactions forbidden by \u00a7 301. To be sure, that casts the risk that there is no guaranty upon all who according to settled doctrines of criminal law are responsible for the commission of a misdemeanor. To read the guaranty section, as did the court below, so as to restrict liability for penalties to the only person who normally would receive a guaranty \u0097 the proprietor \u0097 disregards the admonition that \"the meaning of a sentence is to be felt rather than to be proved.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97441\"><a href=\"/opinion/97441/united-states-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span>, 496. It also reads an exception to an important provision safeguarding the public welfare with a liberality which more appropriately belongs to enforcement of the central purpose of the Act.</p>\n<p>The Circuit Court of Appeals was evidently tempted to make such a devitalizing use of the guaranty provision through fear that an enforcement of \u00a7 301 (a) as written might operate too harshly by sweeping within its condemnation any person however remotely entangled in the proscribed shipment. But that is not the way to read legislation. Literalism and evisceration are equally to be avoided. To speak with technical accuracy, under \u00a7 301 a corporation may commit an offense and all persons who aid and abet its commission are equally guilty. Whether an accused shares responsibility in the business process resulting in unlawful distribution depends on the evidence produced at the trial and its submission \u0097 assuming the evidence warrants it \u0097 to the jury under appropriate guidance. The offense is committed, unless the enterprise which they are serving enjoys the immunity of a guaranty, by all who do have such a responsible share in the furtherance of the transaction which the statute outlaws, namely, to put into the stream of interstate commerce adulterated or misbranded drugs. Hardship there doubtless may be under a statute which thus penalizes the transaction though consciousness of wrongdoing be totally wanting. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*285</span> Balancing relative hardships, Congress has preferred to place it upon those who have at least the opportunity of informing themselves of the existence of conditions imposed for the protection of consumers before sharing in illicit commerce, rather than to throw the hazard on the innocent public who are wholly helpless.</p>\n<p>It would be too treacherous to define or even to indicate by way of illustration the class of employees which stands in such a responsible relation. To attempt a formula embracing the variety of conduct whereby persons may responsibly contribute in furthering a transaction forbidden by an Act of Congress, to wit, to send illicit goods across state lines, would be mischievous futility. In such matters the good sense of prosecutors, the wise guidance of trial judges, and the ultimate judgment of juries must be trusted. Our system of criminal justice necessarily depends on \"conscience and circumspection in prosecuting officers,\" <i>Nash</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97928\"><a href=\"/opinion/97928/nash-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span>, 378, even when the consequences are far more drastic than they are under the provision of law before us. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Balint, supra</i> (involving a maximum sentence of five years). For present purpose it suffices to say that in what the defense characterized as \"a very fair charge\" the District Court properly left the question of the responsibility of Dotterweich for the shipment to the jury, and there was sufficient evidence to support its verdict.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE MURPHY, dissenting:</p>\n<p>Our prime concern in this case is whether the criminal sanctions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 plainly and unmistakably apply to the respondent in his capacity as a corporate officer. He is charged with violating \u00a7 301 (a) of the Act, which prohibits the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any adulterated or misbranded drug. There is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*286</span> no evidence in this case of any personal guilt on the part of the respondent. There is no proof or claim that he ever knew of the introduction into commerce of the adulterated drugs in question, much less that he actively participated in their introduction. Guilt is imputed to the respondent solely on the basis of his authority and responsibility as president and general manager of the corporation.</p>\n<p>It is a fundamental principle of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence that guilt is personal and that it ought not lightly to be imputed to a citizen who, like the respondent, has no evil intention or consciousness of wrongdoing. It may be proper to charge him with responsibility to the corporation and the stockholders for negligence and mismanagement. But in the absence of clear statutory authorization it is inconsistent with established canons of criminal law to rest liability on an act in which the accused did not participate and of which he had no personal knowledge. Before we place the stigma of a criminal conviction upon any such citizen the legislative mandate must be clear and unambiguous. Accordingly that which Chief Justice Marshall has called \"the tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals\"<sup>[1]</sup> entitles each person, regardless of economic or social status, to an unequivocal warning from the legislature as to whether he is within the class of persons subject to vicarious liability. Congress cannot be deemed to have intended to punish anyone who is not \"plainly and unmistakably\" within the confines of the statute. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lacher,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92761\"><a href=\"/opinion/92761/united-states-v-lacher/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span>, 628; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Gradwell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98915\"><a href=\"/opinion/98915/united-states-v-gradwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span>, 485.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the fact that individual liability of corporate officers may be consistent with the policy and purpose of a public health and welfare measure does not authorize this Court to impose such liability where Congress has not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*287</span> clearly intended or actually done so. Congress alone has the power to define a crime and to specify the offenders. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Wiltberger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85284\"><a href=\"/opinion/85284/united-states-v-wiltberger/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span>, 95. It is not our function to supply any deficiencies in these respects, no matter how grave the consequences. Statutory policy and purpose are not constitutional substitutes for the requirement that the legislature specify with reasonable certainty those individuals it desires to place under the interdict of the Act. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Harris,</i> 177 U.S. 305; <i>Sarlls</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 152 U.S. 570.</p>\n<p>Looking at the language actually used in this statute, we find a complete absence of any reference to corporate officers. There is merely a provision in \u00a7 303 (a) to the effect that \"any person\" inadvertently violating \u00a7 301 (a) shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Section 201 (e) further defines \"person\" as including an \"individual, partnership, corporation, and association.\"<sup>[2]</sup> The fact that a corporate officer is both a \"person\" and an \"individual\" is not indicative of an intent to place vicarious liability on the officer. Such words must be read in light of their statutory environment.<sup>[3]</sup> Only if Congress has otherwise specified an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*288</span> intent to place corporate officers within the ambit of the Act can they be said to be embraced within the meaning of the words \"person\" or \"individual\" as here used.</p>\n<p>Nor does the clear imposition of liability on corporations reveal the necessary intent to place criminal sanctions on their officers. A corporation is not the necessary and inevitable equivalent of its officers for all purposes.<sup>[4]</sup> In many respects it is desirable to distinguish the latter from the corporate entity and to impose liability only on the corporation. In this respect it is significant that this Court has never held the imposition of liability on a corporation sufficient, without more, to extend liability to its officers who have no consciousness of wrongdoing.<sup>[5]</sup> Indeed, in a closely analogous situation, we have held that the vicarious personal liability of receivers in actual charge and control of a corporation could not be predicated on the statutory liability of a \"company,\" even when the policy and purpose of the enactment were consistent with personal liability. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Harris, supra.</i><sup></sup>[6] It follows <span class=\"star-pagination\">*289</span> that express statutory provisions are necessary to satisfy the requirement that officers as individuals be given clear and unmistakable warning as to their vicarious personal liability. This Act gives no such warning.</p>\n<p>This fatal hiatus in the Act is further emphasized by the ability of Congress, demonstrated on many occasions, to apply statutes in no uncertain terms to corporate officers as distinct from corporations.<sup>[7]</sup> The failure to mention officers specifically is thus some indication of a desire to exempt them from liability. In fact the history <span class=\"star-pagination\">*290</span> of federal food and drug legislation is itself illustrative of this capacity for specification and lends strong support to the conclusion that Congress did not intend to impose liability on corporate officers in this particular Act.</p>\n<p>Section 2 of the Federal Food and Drugs Act of 1906, as introduced and passed in the Senate, contained a provision to the effect that any violation of the Act by a corporation should be deemed to be the act of the officer responsible therefor and that such officer might be punished as though it were his personal act.<sup>[8]</sup> This clear imposition of criminal responsibility on corporate officers, however, was not carried over into the statute as finally enacted. In its place appeared merely the provision that \"when construing and enforcing the provisions of this Act, the act, omission, or failure of any officer, agent, or other person acting for or employed by any corporation . . . within the scope of his employment or office, shall in every case be also deemed to be the act, omission, or failure of such corporation . . . as well as that of the person.\"<sup>[9]</sup> This provision had the effect only of making corporations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*291</span> responsible for the illegal acts of their officers and proved unnecessary in view of the clarity of the law to that effect. <i>New York Central &amp; H.R.R. Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 212 U.S. 481.</p>\n<p>The framers of the 1938 Act were aware that the 1906 Act was deficient in that it failed \"to place responsibility properly upon corporate officers.\"<sup>[10]</sup> In order \"to provide the additional scope necessary to prevent the use of the corporate form as a shield to individual wrongdoers,\"<sup>[11]</sup> these framers inserted a clear provision that \"whenever a corporation or association violates any of the provisions of this Act, such violation shall also be deemed to be a violation of the individual directors, officers, or agents of such corporation or association who authorized, ordered, or did any of the acts constituting, in whole or in part, such violation.\"<sup>[12]</sup> This paragraph, however, was deleted from the final version of the Act.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*292</span> We cannot presume that this omission was inadvertent on the part of Congress. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Harris, supra</i> at 309. Even if it were, courts have no power to remedy so serious a defect, no matter how probable it otherwise may appear that Congress intended to include officers; \"probability is not a guide which a court, in construing a penal statute, can safely take.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Wiltberger, supra</i> at 105. But the framers of the 1938 Act had an intelligent comprehension of the inadequacies of the 1906 Act and of the unsettled state of the law. They recognized the necessity of inserting clear and unmistakable language in order to impose liability on corporate officers. It is thus unreasonable to assume that the omission of such language was due to a belief that the Act as it now stands was sufficient to impose liability on corporate officers. Such deliberate deletion is consistent only with an intent to allow such officers to remain free from criminal liability. Thus to apply the sanctions of this Act to the respondent would be contrary to the intent of Congress as expressed in the statutory language and in the legislative history.</p>\n<p>The dangers inherent in any attempt to create liability without express Congressional intention or authorization are illustrated by this case. Without any legislative guides, we are confronted with the problem of determining precisely which officers, employees and agents of a corporation are to be subject to this Act by our fiat. To erect standards of responsibility is a difficult legislative task and the opinion of this Court admits that it is \"too treacherous\" and a \"mischievous futility\" for us to engage in such pursuits. But the only alternative is a blind resort to \"the good sense of prosecutors, the wise guidance of trial judges, and the ultimate judgment of juries.\" Yet that situation is precisely what our constitutional system sought to avoid. Reliance on the legislature to define crimes and criminals distinguishes our form of jurisprudence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*293</span> from certain less desirable ones. The legislative power to restrain the liberty and to imperil the good reputation of citizens must not rest upon the variable attitudes and opinions of those charged with the duties of interpreting and enforcing the mandates of the law. I therefore cannot approve the decision of the Court in this case.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS, MR. JUSTICE REED and MR.

Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 4386-4389, which penalized \"any company, owner or custodian of such animals\" who failed to comply with the statutory requirements as to livestock transportation. A railroad company violated the statute and the government sought to impose liability on the receivers who were in actual charge of the company. It was argued that the word \"company\" embraced the natural persons acting on behalf of the company and that to hold such officers and receivers liable was within the policy and purpose of so humane a statute. We rejected this contention in language peculiarly appropriate to this case (177 U.S. at 309):\n</p>\n<p>\"It must be admitted that, in order to hold the receivers, they must be regarded as included in the word `company.' Only by a strained and artificial construction, based chiefly upon a consideration of the mischief which the legislature sought to remedy, can receivers be brought within the terms of the law. But can such a kind of construction be resorted to in enforcing a penal statute? Giving all proper force to the contention of the counsel of the Government, that there has been some relaxation on the part of the courts in applying the rule of strict construction to such statutes, it still remains that the intention of a penal statute must be found in the language actually used, interpreted according to its fair and obvious meaning. It is not permitted to courts, in this class of cases, to attribute inadvertence or oversight to the legislature when enumerating the classes of persons who are subjected to a penal enactment, nor to depart from the settled meaning of words or phrases in order to bring persons not named or distinctly described within the supposed purpose of the statute.\"</p>\n<p>[7]  \"Whenever a corporation shall violate any of the penal provisions of the antitrust laws, such violation shall be deemed to be also that of the individual directors, officers, or agents of such corporation who shall have authorized, ordered, or done any of the acts constituting in whole or in part such violation.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 24.\n</p>\n<p>\"The courts of bankruptcy . . . are hereby invested . . . with such jurisdiction at law and in equity as will enable them to . ..

Thence it traverses the high plains of eastern Colorado and western Kansas. In the areas mentioned the stream is non-navigable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1901 Kansas brought suit against Colorado in this court for an injunction restraining the latter from diverting, or permitting anyone under her authority to divert, waters of the river within Colorado, and for general relief. State of Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U.S. 46, 27 S.Ct. 655, 51 L.Ed. 956.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Kansas in her bill alleged that the waters of the river had been used for irrigation in her western counties and that, after establishment of these uses, Colorado began systematically to appropriate and divert them between Canon City and the Kansas state line for irrigating non-riparian arid lands; that, by 1891, all the natural flow, and much of the flood waters, had been appropriated in Colorado so that the average flow had been greatly reduced and the natural flow completely cut off.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colorado replied that the stream was not continuous except at times of flood; that, in a state of nature, its bed east of Pueblo was frequently dry; that Colorado and her citizens had diverted and used only the perennial flow above Canon City and what had been done in effect conserved water for delivery into Kansas. She denied she had substantially diminished the flow of the river at the state line. She asserted she was entitled to consume the entire flow; but alleged that, in any view, her total appropriations did not amount to an infringement of Kansas' rights calling for judicial interference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court denied Kansas' contention that she was entitled to have the stream flow as it flowed in a state of nature. It denied Colorado's claim that she could dispose of all the waters within her borders, and owed no obligation to pass any of them on to Kansas. It declared that as each state had an equality of right each stood before the court on the same level as the other; that inquiry was not confined to the question whether any portion of the river waters were withheld by Colorado but must include the effect of what had been done upon the conditions in the respective states; and that the court must adjust the dispute on the basis of equality of rights to secure, so far as possible, to Colorado, the benefits of irrigation, without depriving Kansas of the benefits of a flowing stream. The measure of the reciprocal rights and obligations of the states was declared to be an equitable apportionment of the benefits of the river. The court added that, before the developments in Colorado consequent upon irrigation were to be destroyed or materially affected, Kansas must show not merely some technical right but one which carried corresponding benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On examination of the proofs, the court concluded that diversions authorized by Colorado embraced more water than the total flow at Canon City. It found, however, that no clear showing was made as to what surplus water, if any, was contributed by the tributaries below that point or as to the proportion of the diverted water returned to the river by seepage. The opinion described the diversions in each state, analyzed the use made of the water and the benefits derived from it in each, considered population tables and agricultural statistics bearing upon the growth of the communities adjacent to the river in each, and stated conclusions, now material, as follows: That the result of Colorado's appropriations had been beneficial reclamation of many acres; that, while the influence of Colorado's diversions had been of perceptible injury to portions of the Arkansas valley in Kansas, yet to the great body of the valley the diminution of flow had worked little, if any, detriment; that regarding the interests of both states, and the right of each to receive benefit through irrigation and otherwise from the waters of the stream, the court was not satisfied that Kansas had made out a case entitling it to a decree. The court added that if depletion by Colorado continued to increase there would come a time when Kansas might justly say that there was no longer an equitable distribution of benefits and might rightly call for relief against Colorado and her citizens. Accordingly the bill was dismissed without prejudice to future action by Kansas. The taking of evidence ended June 16, 1905, and the decision of the court was announced May 13, 1907.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">October 30, 1909, the Finney County Water Users' Association, which maintained the so-called Farmers Ditch in Kansas, applied to a Kansas court for adjudication of priorities as between various Kansas users of the river water. One of the defendants, the United States Irrigating Company, removed the cause to the United States District Court. A consent decree was entered May 16, 1911, which provided for the allocation and rotation of use amongst certain, but not all, the Kansas ditches, including the Farmers' Ditch. It was, however, provided that the settlement should remain binding upon the parties only until the adjudication of other litigation next to be noticed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">August 27, 1910, United States Irrigating Company sued Graham Ditch Co. and others holding Colorado priorities, in the United States District Court for Colorado, to obtain an adjudication of priorities as between Kansas users and Colorado users. The Finney County Association was denied leave to intervene. Evidence was taken, but the suit was settled by a contract of February 19, 1916. By this settlement, the Colorado defendants agreed to recognize priorities as of August 27, 1910, for all the Kansas ditches in Finney County except the Farmers' Ditch; not to apply for, or claim, priorities for storage purposes on the Purgatoire River, a tributary of the Arkansas, or below the mouth of the Purgatoire, of a date earlier than August 27, 1910; and to pay the costs of suit and an additional sum to the Kansas interests. The Kansas ditches agreed to accept the priority date of August 27, 1910, and the quantities of water specified in the contract, as a definition and determination of their rights. The defendants complied with the terms of the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Finney County Association declined to become a party to the contract and, on November 27, 1916, brought suit in the United States District Court for Colorado against the same defendants for relief like that sought in the United States Irrigating Company's suit. January 29, 1923, the Finney County Association brought a second suit in the same court against other Colorado defendants for similar relief. January 24, 1928, Colorado filed the present bill against Kansas and the Finney County Association.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After formal recitals, the bill refers to our earlier decision, states that, in reliance upon it, money has been spent in the improvement of the irrigation systems in Colorado, recites the prior and the pending private litigation against Colorado appropriators, alleges that the establishment of an interstate priority schedule sought in the pending suits would disrupt and destroy Colorado's administration of the waters of the Arkansas basin and result in conflict of state authority, asserts that no proper settlement of the relative rights of the States can be obtained in suits by Kansas appropriators against Colorado appropriators, outlines other injury to Colorado threatened by prosecution of the pending cases to judgment, and prays that the Finney County Association be enjoined from further pressing those suits, that Kansas and her citizens be enjoined from litigating, or attempting to litigate, the relative rights of the two states and their citizens to the waters of the river on claims similar to those made by the Association in its pending suits, and that the rights of Colorado and her citizens as determined by the judgment in State of Kansas v. Colorado be protected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kansas' answer admits some allegations of the bill and denies others, sets forth her alleged rights in the waters of the river, recites appropriations by Kansas residents and citizens, diversions by Colorado citizens under appropriations junior in time and inferior in right to those made in Kansas, and asserts that, since the filing of the complaint in State of Kansas v. Colorado, Colorado users have largely increased their appropriations and diversions, and threaten further to increase them, to the injury of Kansas users. She prays that the court protect and quiet her rights and those of her citizens and residents, including the Finney County Association, to their appropriations, that the rights of her citizens and residents to divert water from the river for irrigation be decreed in second feet and that Colorado, her officers, agents, and citizens be perpetually enjoined from diverting any waters from the river or its tributaries in Colorado until the rights of Kansas, her citizens and residents, are satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Finney County Association filed an answer admitting and denying averments of the bill and affirmatively praying that Colorado and her citizens be enjoined from diverting water from the river until the Association's right to 250 second feet is satisfied. The issues were made up by Colorado's reply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to our order, evidence was taken by a Commissioner. Thereupon the cause was referred to a Master with leave to take additional evidence, and direction, in the light of all the evidence, to state findings of fact, conclusions of law, and to recommend a form of decree. The evidence consists of some seven thousand typewritten pages of testimony and 368 exhibits covering thousands of pages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Master states that the 'evidence is voluminous and conflicting on many of the material issues of fact', but his report contains no discussion or analysis of the proofs. Apart from formal recitals, the report consists of fourteen findings of fact&#8212;more properly conclusions of fact&#8212;nine conclusions of law, and a recommended form of decree. Each party has filed exceptions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three questions emerge from the pleadings. (1) Is Colorado entitled to an injunction against the further prosecution of litigation by Kansas users against Colorado users? (2) Does the situation call for allocation of the waters of the basin as between Colorado and Kansas in second feet or acre feet? (3) Has Kansas proved that Colorado has substantially and injuriously aggravated conditions which existed at the time of her earlier suit?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Master concluded that the first question should be answered in the affirmative. Kansas has not excepted to the conclusion or to the corresponding provisions of the proposed decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bearing upon the second question, the Master found that 'the average annual natural flow of the river and its tributaries' is 1,240,000 acre feet, and the 'average annual dependable and fairly continuous water supply and flow' 1,110,000 acre feet. He recommends that the dependable flow be allocated 925,000 acre feet to Colorado and 185,000 acre feet to Kansas, 150,000 thereof between April 1 and October 1, and 35,000 between October 1 and April 1 of each year,&#8212;that is, five-sixths to Colorado and one-sixth to Kansas. He submits a form of decree embodying this allocation and adjusting required deliveries in the same proportions upward or downward in accordance with annual flows in excess of, or less than, the stated average annual dependable flow. He has not attempted to define flood waters or the extent to which they are unusable by either state, and suggests no provision whereby their occurrence may be taken into account in defining Colorado's obligation to deliver water to Kansas. The form of decree requires measurement of flow by gauges, one at Canton City and the other at the mouth of the Purgatoire, and deliveries to Kansas prorated to the total of the flows at those points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both States except to these features of the decree as ambiguous and impossible of administration. Kansas, while asserting that the award to her is inadequate, professes her willingness to accept the recommended allocation, but insists that the decree require Colorado to deliver the quantity of water awarded to Kansas when and as demanded by her. Colorado asserts that the recommended decree,&#8212;much more Kansas' proposed amendment, would entail serious and unjustified damage to her interests, if indeed compliance with its terms were possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In respect of the third question, the Master finds:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'There has been since the taking of testimony in the case of (State of) Kansas against Colorado cited in 206 U.S. 46 (27 S.Ct. 655, 51 L.Ed. 956), in 1907, a material increase in the river depletion by Colorado of the water supply of the Arkansas River, which has been consumed and used by Colorado users for irrigation purposes and which has diminished the flow of the water into the State of Kansas and that by reason thereof there has been injuries to the substantial interests in Kansas.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No exception is taken to the Master's recommendation that an injunction issue against further prosecution of the Finney County Association suits against Colorado users. In our view such an injunction is appropriate, and should be granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colorado urges that our decision in State of Kansas v. Colorado, supra, amounted to an allocation of the flow of the Arkansas River between the two States. We cannot accept this view. In that case Kansas labored under a burden of proof applicable in litigation between quasi-sovereign states, of which more hereafter. The dismissal of her bill resulted from the conclusion that she had failed to sustain the burden. But from the decision then rendered it follows that unless Kansas can show a present situation materially different from that disclosed in the earlier case she cannot now obtain relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prayer of Kansas for an apportionment in second feet or acre feet cannot be granted. In our former decision we ruled that Kansas was not entitled to a specific share of the waters as they flowed in a state of nature, that it did not then appear that Colorado had appropriated more than her equitable share of the flow, and that if Kansas were later to be accorded relief, she must show additional takings working serious injuries to her substantial interests. This was in accord with other decisions in similar controversies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reason for judicial caution in adjudicating the relative rights of states in such cases is that, while we have jurisdiction of such disputes,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> they involve the interests of quasi-sovereigns, present complicated and delicate questions, and, due to the possibility of future change of conditions, necessitate expert administration rather than judicial imposition of a hard and fast rule. Such controversies may appropriately be composed by negotiation and agreement, pursuant to the compact clause of the Federal constitution. We say of this case, as the court has said of interstate differences of like nature, that such mutual accommodation and agreement should, if possible, be the medium of settlement, instead of invocation of our adjudicatory power.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It follows that the Master erred in attempting to divide what he designated as the 'average annual dependable' water supply of the Arkansas River in Colorado into fractions and awarding those fractions to the states respectively. Such a controversy as is here presented is not to be determined as if it were one between two private riparian proprietors or appropriators.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower state is not entitled to have the stream flow as it would in nature regardless of need or use.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> If, then, the upper state is devoting the water to a beneficial use, the question to be decided, in the light of existing conditions in both states, is whether, and to what extent, her action injures the lower state and her citizens by depriving them of a like, or an equally valuable, beneficial use.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We come now to the vital question whether Kansas has made good her claim to relief founded on the charge that Colorado has, since our prior decision, increased depletion of the water supply to the material damage of Kansas' substantial interests. The question must be answered in the light of rules of decision appropriate to the quality of the parties and the nature of the suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In such disputes as this, the court is conscious of the great and serious caution with which it is necessary to approach the inquiry whether a case is proved. Not every matter which would warrant resort to equity by one citizen against another would justify our interference with the action of a state, for the burden on the complaining state is much greater than that generally required to be borne by private parties. Before the court will intervene the case must be of serious magnitude and fully and clearly proved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> And in determining whether one state is using, or threatening to use, more than its equitable share of the benefits of a stream, all the factors which create equities in favor of one state or the other must be weighed as of the date when the controversy is mooted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this record there can be no doubt that a decree such as the Master recommends, or an amendment or enlargement of that decree in the form Kansas asks, would inflict serious damage on existing agricultural interests in Colorado. How great the injury would be it is difficult to determine, but certainly the proposed decree would operate to deprive some citizens of Colorado, to some extent, of their means of support. It might indeed result in the abandonment of valuable improvements and actual migration from farms. Through practice of irrigation, Colorado's agriculture in the basin has grown steadily for fifty years. With this development has gone a large investment in canals, reservoirs, and farms. The progress has been open. The facts were of common knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The controversy was litigated in 1901. Kansas was denied relief in 1907. The dispute between appropriators in the two states was brought into court in 1910 and settled in 1916. The Finney County Association sued Colorado appropriators in 1916 and 1923. Even if Kansas' claims of increased depletion and ensuing damage are taken at face value, it is nevertheless evident that while improvements based upon irrigation went forward in Colorado for twenty-one years, Kansas took no action until Colorado filed the instant complaint in 1928.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These facts might well preclude the award of the relief Kansas asks. But, in any event, they gravely add to the burden she would otherwise bear, and must be weighed in estimating the equities of the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Master concludes that there has been a material increase in depletion by Colorado, a consequent diminution of flow across the state line, and injury to the substantial interests of Kansas. His report does not state what he considers material; or the extent of the diminution of flow; or the interests of Kansas which have been injured and the extent of the injury. We must, therefore, turn to the evidence to resolve the issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kansas asserts that since the decision of State of Kansas v. Colorado, supra, Colorado has increased her consumptive use of the water of the Arkansas River by an annual average of between 300,000 and 400,000 acre feet. Witnesses so testified and, to support their conclusions, submitted elaborate calculations and analyses exhibiting the alleged total water supply of the river basin in Colorado and the alleged amount of water passing in the bed of the stream across the state line. A witness submitted tables covering the period 1895-1930 from which he deduced an average yearly water supply of 1,240,000 acre feet and an average annual dependable supply of 1,110,000 acre feet. He presented figures to show that Colorado's consumptive use had increased to the extent of an annual average of 300,000 acre feet. He reached this result by using estimated flow across the state line between 1895 and 1908 and measured flow between 1908 and 1930, during which period a gauging station was maintained at Holly near the line. Measurements indicate that, during the latter period, the average annual state line flow was 260,700 acre feet.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> If, as claimed, this flow remained after an additional average annual depletion of 300,000 acre feet by Colorado, the average annual flow in the earlier period, 1895 to 1908, would necessarily have been greater by 300,000, or would have averaged 560,700 acre feet. The witness' own exhibit shows that he assumed an average annual state line flow for the period 1895&#8212;1899 of 300,000 acre feet, for 1900-1904, of 470,000 acre feet, and, for 1905-1909, of 454,000 acre feet, or an annual average over the total period, 1895-1909, of 408,000 acre feet. On his own estimates the claimed average annual depletion of 300,000 acre feet could not have taken place. Moreover, the force of this evidence is weakened by Kansas' allegations in State of Kansas v. Colorado, supra. In her bill in that case she alleged Colorado had totally destroyed the normal flow of the river exclusive of floods whereas she now asserts that the flow at the time of the earlier suit was such that Colorado has been able to deplete it on an annual average of 300,000 acre feet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The records of Colorado's consumption and ditch diversions, and the Colorado and Kansas exhibits showing the divertible and usable state line flow, rebut such an increase as Kansas asserts. Kansas's expert witness himself testified that the diversion records show no material change in Colorado diversions since 1905 and that if acreage in Colorado has expanded under the ditches on the main stem of the river it has done so because of an improved duty of water; that, during the period, the river gains due to return flow have increased, the consumptive use of water has declined, and relatively the stream flows have improved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Kansas ditches are capable of diverting water only up to 2,000 c.f.s. When the flow is greater the excess cannot be diverted and used. It is admitted that the character of the flow of the river in Colorado is variable from year to year, from season to season, and from day to day, and the main river below Canon City may be almost without water one day, run a flood the next day, and, on the following day, be in practically its original condition. Thus it appears that both in Colorado and in Kansas there may at one time be flood water unavailable for direct diversion and, at another, not enough water to supply the capacity of diversion ditches. The critical matter is the amount of divertible flow at times when water is most needed for irrigation. Calculations of average annual flow, which include flood flows, are, therefore, not helpful in ascertaining the dependable supply of water usable for irrigation. That supply has, in Colorado, been supplemented by the extensive use of reservoirs for storage of flood waters and winter flows not usable or needed for irrigation. Though western Kansas affords sites for similar storage reservoirs, but one small basin has been constructed in that State. On the other hand, the storage in Colorado, and the release of stored water to supplement the natural flow of the stream in times of need, operates by seepage and return to the channel to stabilize and improve the flow at the state line and, to that extent, benefits irrigation in Kansas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kansas relies heavily upon the increase of irrigated acreage in Colorado since our decision in 1907. The testimony in the earlier case was closed in 1905. The then latest available census, for 1902&#8212;reported 300,115 acres under irrigation in the Arkansas basin in Colorado. In its opinion the court referred to this figure. The next census&#8212;for 1909&#8212;gives the Colorado acreage as 464,236. The later reports disclose an addition of less than 5,000 acres between 1909 and 1939. Thus a total of about 170,000 additional acres has been put under irrigation since 1902. On its face this record would seem to indicate a large increase of consumptive use by Colorado, but the acreage under irrigation does not afford a reliable measure of actual consumption. When first turned in, the water is rapidly absorbed by the sub-soil with consequent high consumption. By continued irrigation the sub-soil becomes saturated, the water table rises, and water, in increasing quantities, flows back to the stream. Ultimately consumption falls well below diversion. The returned water again may be diverted and again supply return flows. Since the decision in the earlier case, studies of return flows have been made which indicate a steady reduction in the quantity of water consumed per acre of irrigated land.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Practically all of the affected Kansas ditches are in three western counties. Tables taken from the United States census show that, in 1899, acreage irrigated in these counties was 6% of that irrigated in the Colorado basin. In 1909 it was 7%, in 1929, 9.7%, and, in 1939, 10.7%. It seems that Colorado cannot have depleted the usable supply passing into Kansas if acreage under irrigation is any measure of depletion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever may be said of the practices of Colorado since 1905, Kansas is not entitled to relief unless she shows they clearly have entailed serious damage to her substantial interests and those of her citizens. It is not necessary to quote the findings of this court made in the earlier case. We need only say they disclose that some ditches in western Kansas has been abandoned for lack of available water and all ditches were suffering from shortages of flow. The court pointed out that Colorado had authorized diversions in excess of the flow at Canon City. And the record in the present case indicates that, except for seepage and return flow, the appropriations Colorado has authorized from the basin, as a whole, exceed the available dependable flow of the stream and its tributaries, and this appears to have been true also in 1901. It appears, nevertheless, that, since 1904, an increased quantity of usable water has passed the state line, for it is testified by Kansas' expert witness that, between 1895 and 1902, no divertible water passed the line and none between 1903 and 1907, except in 1903 and 1905, whereas, in each year since 1908 divertible water has crossed the state line in varying quantities and, in most years, in substantial amounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kansas, however, insists that 414,000 acres in western Kansas are susceptible of successful irrigation, and much of this land would have been irrigated had Colorado not deprived Kansas of her equitable share of the flow. The evidence is that the acreage now irrigated in Kansas lies close to the river and along the river bottom. The land claimed to be susceptible of irrigation extends many miles from the bed of the river. We are asked to speculate as to how much of this land would have been put under irrigation under more favorable circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As has been pointed out, despite Colorado's alleged increased depletion, the acreage under irrigation in western Kansas through existing ditches has steadily increased, over the period 1895-1939, from approximately 15,000 acres to approximately 56,000 acres. Moreover, the arid lands in western Kansas are underlaid at shallow depths with great quantities of ground water available for irrigation by pumping at low initial and maintenance cost. There is persuasive testimony that farmers who could be served from existing ditches have elected not to take water therefrom but to instal pumping systems because of lower cost.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, there is serious question whether lands which are not riparian may divert the water from the stream for irrigation. In the earlier suit Kansas asserted,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> and the court held,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> that the common law prevailed in Kansas and governed the rights of riparian owners. It is true that the rule as to riparian rights has been expanded by the common law of Kansas to permit a riparian proprietor reasonable use of the waters of a stream for irrigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> But such use is subject to the rights of other riparian owners to a like reasonable use. What is reasonable must, in each instance, be determined in the light of total supply and total need of all riparian owners.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> It is also true that, beginning in 1886, Kansas, by statute, recognized appropriation for irrigation. But there is doubt whether the privilege is not restricted to riparian owners in some portions of the state. The Supreme Court of Kansas has held that, where a title originates in a grant antedating the Act of 1886, the right of appropriation is limited by the common law as to riparian rights, which are rights of property derived from the original patent or deed in the line of title.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> It seems that title to much of the land along the Arkansas Valley in western Kansas was originally granted or patented prior to 1886. The brief and argument of Kansas, while referring to the statutes of the state authorizing appropriation, make no reference to the Kansas decisions and no showing with respect to the right of non-riparian owners to appropriate waters against objection by other such owners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The official census figures submitted bearing upon population of the western counties of Kansas, and the agricultural production in them, give no support to a claim that the inhabitants have suffered for lack of arable and productive land. Generally speaking, the population has steadily increased and the agricultural production has also risen throughout the period in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All these considerations persuade us that Kansas has not sustained her allegations that Colorado's use has materially increased, and that the increase has worked a serious detriment to the substantial interests of Kansas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A decree should be entered enjoining the further prosecution of the Finney County Association's suits, and dismissing the prayers of both States for other relief. The parties may submit such a decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Decree in accordance with opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The court overruled a demurrer to the bill and required Colorado to answer. State of Kansas v. Colorado, 185 U.S. 125, 22 S.Ct. 552, 46 L.Ed. 838.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> See the cases in notes 3, 4 and 6 infra.

Colorado, 259 U.S. 419, 42 S.Ct. 552, 66 L.Ed. 999, is not an exception. As it happened, the doctrine of appropriation had always prevailed in each of the states there concerned and furnished the most appropriate and accurate measure of their respective rights of appropriation of the flow of the Laramie River. It was, therefore, possible in enforcing equitable apportionment, to limit the amount of water which Colorado might, without injury to Wyoming's interests, divert to another water shed, to an amount not exceeding the unappropriated flow.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> State of Missouri v.
