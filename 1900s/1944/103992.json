The question now presented is, in short, whether Iowa may collect, in the circumstances of this case, such a use tax from General Trading Company, a Minnesota corporation, on the basis of property bought from Trading Company and sent by it from Minnesota to purchasers in Iowa for use and enjoyment there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the Iowa Use Tax Law a tax is 'imposed on the use in this state of tangible personal property purchased * * * for use in this state, at the rate of two percent of the purchase price of such property. Said tax is * * * imposed upon every person using such property within this state until such tax has been paid directly to the county treasurer, to a retailer, or to the commission * * *.' &#167; 6943.103, Code of Iowa 1939. The use of property the sale of which is subject to Iowa's sales tax is exempted from the use tax (&#167; 6943.104(1), but the sales tax can be laid only on sales at retail within the State. &#167; 6943.075. The use tax constitutes a debt owed by the retailer to the State. &#167; 6943.112. But 'Every retailer maintaining a place of business' in Iowa must collect this tax from the purchaser (&#167; 6943.109), and may not advertise that he will himself absorb the tax. &#167; 6943.111.

The application by that Court of its local laws and the facts on which it founded its judgment are of course controlling here. From these it appears that General Trading Company had never qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in Iowa nor does it maintain there any office, branch or warehouse. The property on which the use tax was laid was sent to Iowa as a result of orders solicited by traveling salesmen sent into Iowa from their Minnesota headquarters. The orders were always subject to acceptance in Minnesota whence the goods were shipped into Iowa by common carriers or the post. Upon these facts and its holding that Trading Company was a 'retailer maintaining a place of business in this state' within the meaning of the Iowa Statute, the Iowa Supreme Court held that Iowa had not exceeded its powers in the imposition of this use tax on Iowa purchasers, and that collection could validly be made through the Trading Company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We brought the case here, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></span>, 64 S.Ct. 206, to meet the claim that there was need for further precision regarding the scope of our previous rulings on the power of States to levy use taxes. In view however of the clear understanding by the court below that the facts we have summarized bring the transaction within the taxing power of Iowa, there is little need for elaboration. We agree with the Iowa Supreme Court that Felt &amp; Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103137\"><a href=\"/opinion/103137/felt-tarrant-mfg-co-v-gallagher/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span>, 59 S.Ct. 376, 83 L.Ed. 488; Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., supra; and Nelson v. Montgomery Ward, supra, are controlling. The Gallagher case is indistinguishable&#8212;certainly nothing can turn on the more elaborate arrangements for soliciting orders for an intricate machine for shipment from without a State as in the Gallagher case, compared with the apparently simpler needs for soliciting business in this case. And the fact that in the Sears Roebuck and Montgomery Ward cases the interstate vendor also had retail stores in Iowa, whose sales were appropriately subjected to the sales tax, is constitutionally irrelevant to the right of Iowa sustained in those cases to exact a use tax from purchasers on mail order goods forwarded into Iowa from without the State. All these differentiations are without constitutional significance. Of course, no State can tax the privilege of doing interstate business. See Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102972\"><a href=\"/opinion/102972/western-live-stock-v-bureau-of-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span>, 58 S.Ct. 546, 82 L.Ed. 823, 115 A.L.R. 944. That is within the protection of the Commerce Clause and subject to the power of Congress. On the other hand, the mere fact that property is used for interstate commerce or has come into an owner's possession as a result of interstate commerce does not diminish the protection which he may draw from a State to the upkeep of which he may be asked to bear his fair share. But a fair share precludes legislation obviously hostile or practically discriminatory toward interstate commerce. See Best &amp; Co. v. Maxwell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103416\"><a href=\"/opinion/103416/best-co-v-maxwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span>, 61 S.Ct. 334, 85 L.Ed. 275.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mone of these infirmities affects the tax in this case any more than it did in the other cases with which it forms a group. The tax is what it professes to be&#8212;a non-discriminatory excise laid on all personal property consumed in Iowa. The property is enjoyed by an Iowa resident partly because the opportunity is given by Iowa to enjoy property no matter whence acquired. The exaction is made against the ultimate consumer&#8212;the Iowa resident who is paying taxes to sustain his own state government. To make the distributor the tax collector for the State is a familiar and sanctioned device. Monamotor Oil Co. v.

The General Trading Company is, in the language of the opinion, made 'the tax collector for the tax.' We have heretofore held, and I think properly, that the state may make tax collectors of those who come in and do business within its jurisdiction, for thereby they submit themselves to its power. Such was the situation in both Monamotor Oil Co. v. Johnson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102253\"><a href=\"/opinion/102253/monamotor-oil-co-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 54 S.Ct. 575, 78 L.Ed. 1141, and Felt &amp; Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103137\"><a href=\"/opinion/103137/felt-tarrant-mfg-co-v-gallagher/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span>, 59 S.Ct. 376, 83 L.Ed. 488. These are the only authorities cited by the Court on this point, and they clearly are not precedents to support this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, as the opinion points out, the General Trading Company never qualified in Iowa and has no office, branch, warehouse, or general agent in the State. From Minnesota it ships goods ordered from salesmen by purchasers in Iowa. Orders are accepted only in Minnesota. The transaction of sale is not taxed and, being clearly interstate commerce, is not taxable. McLeod v. Dilworth Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103991\"><a href=\"/opinion/103991/mcleod-v-je-dilworth-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span>, 64 S.Ct. 1023. So we are holding that a state has power to make a tax collector of one whom it has no power to tax. Certainly no state has a constitutional warrant for making a tax collector of one as the price of the privilege of doing interstate commerce. He does not get the right from the state, and the state cannot qualify it. I can imagine no principle of states' rights or state comity which can justify what is done here. Nor does the practice seem conducive to good order in the federal system. The power of Iowa to enforce collection in other states is certainly very limited and the effort to do so on any wide scale is unlikely either to be systematically pursued or successfully executed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I recognize the pressure to uphold all manner of efforts to collect tax moneys. But this decision, by which one may not ship goods from anywhere in the United States to a purchaser in Iowa without becoming a nonresident tax collector, exceeds everything so far done by this Court. In my opinion the statute is an effort to exert extraterritorial control beyond any which a state could exert if there were no Constitution at all. I can think of nothing in or out of the Constitution which warrants this effort to reach beyond the State's own border to make out-of-state merchants tax collectors because they engage in interstate commerce with the State's citizens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice ROBERTS joins in this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
