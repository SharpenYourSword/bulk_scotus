The question is whether the Circuit Court of Appeals properly reversed<sup>[1]</sup> the Tax Court's conclusion<sup>[2]</sup> that the corporation was taxable under \u00a7 22 of the Internal Revenue Code<sup>[3]</sup> for the gain which accrued from the sale. The answer depends upon whether the findings of the Tax Court that the whole transaction showed a sale by the corporation rather than by the stockholders were final and binding upon the Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>It is unnecessary to set out in detail the evidence introduced before the Tax Court or its findings. Despite conflicting evidence, the following findings of the Tax Court are supported by the record:</p>\n<p>The respondent corporation was organized in 1934 solely to buy and hold the apartment building which was the only property ever owned by it. All of its outstanding stock was owned by Minnie Miller and her husband. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*333</span> Between October 1, 1939 and February, 1940, while the corporation still had legal title to the property, negotiations for its sale took place. These negotiations were between the corporation and the lessees of the property, together with a sister and brother-in-law. An oral agreement was reached as to the terms and conditions of sale, and on February 22, 1940, the parties met to reduce the agreement to writing. The purchaser was then advised by the corporation's attorney that the sale could not be consummated because it would result in the imposition of a large income tax on the corporation. The next day, the corporation declared a \"liquidating dividend,\" which involved complete liquidation of its assets, and surrender of all outstanding stock. Mrs. Miller and her husband surrendered their stock, and the building was deeded to them. A sale contract was then drawn, naming the Millers individually as vendors, and the lessees' sister as vendee, which embodied substantially the same terms and conditions previously agreed upon. One thousand dollars, which a month and a half earlier had been paid to the corporation by the lessees, was applied in part payment of the purchase price. Three days later, the property was conveyed to the lessees' sister.</p>\n<p>The Tax Court concluded from these facts that, despite the declaration of a \"liquidating dividend\" followed by the transfers of legal title, the corporation had not abandoned the sales negotiations; that these were mere formalities designed \"to make the transaction appear to be other than what it was\" in order to avoid tax liability. The Circuit Court of Appeals drawing different inferences from the record, held that the corporation had \"called off\" the sale, and treated the stockholders' sale as unrelated to the prior negotiations.</p>\n<p>There was evidence to support the findings of the Tax Court, and its findings must therefore be accepted by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*334</span> courts. <i>Dobson</i> v. <i>Commissioner,</i> 320 U.S. 489; <i>Commissioner</i> v. <i>Heininger,</i> 320 U.S. 467; <i>Commissioner</i> v. <i>Scottish American Investment Co.,</i> 323 U.S. 119. On the basis of these findings, the Tax Court was justified in attributing the gain from the sale to respondent corporation. The incidence of taxation depends upon the substance of a transaction.
