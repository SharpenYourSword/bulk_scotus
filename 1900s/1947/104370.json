The record indicates that petitioner was without legal assistance throughout all these proceedings and was never advised of his right to counsel.

The court indicated that it had given consideration to the case of <i>Hawk</i> v. <i>Olson,</i> 326 U.S. 271 (1945), and the authorities cited therein, but concluded that the rule of the Michigan cases was determinative.
