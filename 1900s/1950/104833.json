There she was asked several <span class=\"star-pagination\">*160</span> questions concerning the Communist Party of Colorado and her employment by it.<sup>[1]</sup> Petitioner refused to answer these questions on the ground that the answers might tend to incriminate her. She was then taken before the district judge where the questions were again propounded and where she again claimed her constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and refused to testify. The district judge found petitioner guilty of contempt of court and sentenced her to imprisonment for one year. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed. 180 F. 2d 103. We granted certiorari because the decision appeared to deny rights guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.<sup>[2]</sup> The holding below also was in conflict with recent decisions of the Fifth and Ninth Circuits. <i>Estes</i> v. <i>Potter,</i> 183 F. 2d 865; <i>Alexander</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 181 F. 2d 480.</p>\n<p>At the time petitioner was called before the grand jury, the Smith Act was on the statute books making it a crime among other things to advocate knowingly the desirability of overthrow of the Government by force or violence; to organize or help to organize any society or group which <span class=\"star-pagination\">*161</span> teaches, advocates or encourages such overthrow of the Government; to be or become a member of such a group with knowledge of its purposes.<sup>[3]</sup> These provisions made future prosecution of petitioner far more than \"a mere imaginary possibility . . . .\" <i>Mason</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 244 U.

Whether such admissions by themselves would support a conviction under a criminal statute is immaterial. Answers to the questions asked by the grand jury would have furnished a link in the chain of evidence needed in a prosecution of petitioner for violation of (or conspiracy to violate) the Smith Act.
