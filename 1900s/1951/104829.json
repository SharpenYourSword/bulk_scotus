A neuropsychiatrist attached to petitioner's division reported, after examining petitioner, that he was legally sane. The Division Staff Judge Advocate recommended a general court-martial trial, stating there was no reason to believe petitioner to be temporarily or permanently deranged. The defense of insanity was not raised, however, either at the pretrial investigation or the trial itself. After the trial petitioner's trial counsel wrote the Division Commanding General requesting that the case be reopened and petitioner be given a neuropsychiatric examination on the ground that counsel had received information that petitioner might have been in an epileptic fit at the time of the offense. This request received the concurrence of five of the six members of the court-martial and was accompanied by similar letters from two officers and a sergeant of petitioner's division.

The Judge Advocate General reviewed all the evidence on the insanity issue which petitioner had tendered both to the military authorities and to the District Court in the habeas corpus proceeding and concluded 'I entertain no doubt that Whelchel was so far free from mental defect, disease, and derangement as to be able concerning the particular acts charged both to distinguish right from wrong and to adhere to the right. * * *'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any error by the military in evaluating the evidence on the question of insanity would not go to jurisdiction, the only issue before the court in habeas corpus proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law member of the court-martial was not named from the Judge Advocate General's Department.

The Judge Advocate General reviewed all the evidence on the insanity issue which petitioner had tendered both to the military authorities and to the District Court in the habeas corpus proceeding and concluded \"I entertain no doubt that Whelchel was so far free from mental defect, disease, and derangement as to be able concerning the particular acts charged both to distinguish right from wrong and to adhere to the right . . . .\"</p>\n<p>Any error by the military in evaluating the evidence on the question of insanity would not go to jurisdiction, the only issue before the court in habeas corpus proceedings.</p>\n<p>The law member of the court-martial was not named from the Judge Advocate General's Department. But since no showing was made of the availability of such a member, a case of gross abuse of discretion has not been established. See <i>Hiatt</i> v. <i>Brown,</i> 339 U. S. 103, 109-110.</p>\n<p>Under Article 4 of the revised Articles of War an accused may now request that enlisted men be included on the court-martial that tries him.<sup>[5]</sup> There was no such provision of the law when petitioner was tried.<sup>[6]</sup> But the fact that he was tried by a court-martial composed wholly of officers does not raise a question which goes to jurisdiction. Petitioner can gain no support from the analogy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> of trial by jury in the civil courts. The right to trial by jury guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment is not applicable to trials by courts-martial or military commissions. See <i>Kahn</i> v. <i>Anderson,</i> 255 U. S. 1, 8; <i>Ex parte Quirin,</i> 317 U. S. 1, 40-41. Courts-martial have been composed of officers both before and after the adoption of the Constitution.<sup>[7]</sup> The constitution of courts-martial, like other matters relating to their organization and administration (see <i>Kahn</i> v. <i>Anderson, supra,</i> 6-7; <i>Swaim</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 165 U. S. 553, 556-559; <i>Mullan</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 140 U.
