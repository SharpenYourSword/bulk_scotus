Before insured's death in 1945, petitioner, described by insured as her \"brother,\" had been designated as beneficiary. The husband of the insured was interpleaded as a conflicting claimant. If petitioner, who was insured's brother by virtue of an adoption decree, is not within the permissible class of beneficiaries under \u00a7 602 (g) of the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940,<sup>[*]</sup> the husband is entitled to the proceeds in this case.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*113</span> The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court which had held that an adopted brother was not a permissible beneficiary under \u00a7 602 (g). 185 F. 2d 134 (C. A. 8th Cir. 1950). See also the prior opinion of that court in this proceeding, 167 F. 2d 774 (C. A. 8th Cir. 1948). The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit had reached a directly contrary conclusion under similar circumstances. <i>Carpenter</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 168 F. 2d 369 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1948). Our grant of certiorari was limited to the question whether a brother by adoption is within the permissible class of beneficiaries under \u00a7 602 (g) of the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940. 340 U.

The short of the matter is that Congress has not expressed itself in regard to the question before us. In resolving the conflict of decisions, we must determine whether the word \"brother,\" as used in this federal statute, restricts the policyholder's choice of beneficiaries to brothers of the blood. We are persuaded by the policy against drawing such a distinction in the family relationship. Contemporaneous legal treatment of adopted children as though born into the family is a manifestation of that policy. See <i>Carpenter</i> v. <i>United States, supra</i><i>; </i><i>McDonald</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 91 F. Supp. 163 (D. C. D. Mass. 1950).
