This statute was repealed by the Oklahoma Legislature on May 26, 1951, Okla.

S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 10, and amount to a denial of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, appellants argue that the statute is an unreasonable exercise of the State's police power and an unreasonable delegation of legislative and judicial power to private groups. In addition, appellants maintain that the statute is too vague and indefinite to furnish the Commission with any reasonable guide for the issuance of orders approving unitization plans, and that the evidence does not support the Commission's findings of fact.</p>\n<p>In the light of our previous decisions, appellants have failed to raise any substantial federal questions and the appeals are therefore dismissed. <i>Cities Service Gas Co.</i> v. <i>Peerless Oil &amp; Gas Co.,</i> 340 U.
