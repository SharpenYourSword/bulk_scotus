A copy of the newspaper containing the article      was found in the jury room. We do not think, however, that such a report,      erroneous as it was, made a fair trial impossible.

He told the newspaper reporters of matters which (so he later advised the court) they promised not to print. In the next morning's New York Times, there appeared a story, told with typical journalistic vigor, about 'export racketeers' who 'poured $500,000 of commodities into European and South African black markets.' The significance of the newspaper story was this: It professed to recount the testimony of a witness that Leviton, over the phone, had offered him a $200 bribe to withdraw from customs files a fraudulent declaration. The article detailed the attempted bribe, the meeting place for its completion and the substitution of a $44 gift of shirts for the originally-offered $200. This most damaging story of the $200 bribe is wholly unsupported by the evidence. Accordingly, had the prosecutor written letters to the jurors retelling this story, of course we would reverse. He did the equivalent. For it is outrightly conceded that the Times reporter learned this tale from the prosecutor, and that four copies of the newspaper article were found in the jury-room on the third day of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'My colleagues admit that 'trial by newspaper' is      unfortunate.

The futility of that sort of exorcism is notorious. As I have      elsewhere observed, it is like the Mark Twain story of the      little boy who was told to stand in a corner and not to think      of a white elephant.

(2)      The article was no statement of opinion or editorial, but a      professed account of court-room evidence calculated to confuse and mislead juror-readers. In such      cases, courts recognize that, for all practical purposes,      defendants are deprived of their constitutional rights to      confront witnesses, cross-examine and contradict them, and to      object to evidence as irrelevant or incompetent&#8212;in short all      the elements of a fair trial. Last year, two Supreme Court      Justices advocated in a concurring opinion the reversal of a      conviction upon the ground that an officer of the court had      released to the local press information about confessions of      the defendants never introduced at the trial.

That test      has been employed only when the newspaper itself was      threatened with criminal punishment for the publication. It      certainly should not be carried over to a case like this one      where convicted defendants may well have been prejudiced by a      newspaper article. In such a case, the 'clear and present      danger' test would bar reversals for all but the most      flagrantly scurrilous or deceptive newspaper attacks. Courts,      in reversing convictions for trial-by-newspaper, have always      recognized that printed matter may be prejudicial enough to      require a new trial without evidencing so depraved an      attitude of the publisher as to support a contempt citation.
