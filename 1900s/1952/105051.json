By his will he devised an undivided one-third interest in the allotment to his widow and an undivided two-thirds interest to his son. No fee patent to the land has issued to Paukune, to his widow, or to the son. The trust period of twenty-five years has from time to time been extended.

The petitioners answered, alleging that Juana was a non-Indian and therefore not exempt from the taxes. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*173</span> trial court, without determining whether the widow was an Indian, held her interest nontaxable by the state; and the Supreme Court of Oklahoma affirmed, 206 Okla. 527, 244 P. 2d 1137, saying it mattered not under federal law whether the widow was Indian or non-Indian.
