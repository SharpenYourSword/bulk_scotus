Sweeping control of the business was reserved by General Motors in a \"Direct Dealer Selling Agreement.\" Howell had to sign this agreement to get his \"non-exclusive privilege of selling new Chevrolet motor vehicles and chassis\" and \"parts and accessories.\" The agreement required Howell to make varied and detailed reports about his business affairs, to devote full time to Chevrolet sales, to keep his sales facilities at a location and conduct the business in a manner that satisfied General Motors, to permit General Motors to inspect Howell's books, accounts, facilities, stocks and accessories and to keep such uniform accounting systems as General Motors might prescribe. Many other terms of the agency agreement also emphasized the interdependence of Howell's local and General Motors' national activities.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*484</span> All this evidence caused the Board to conclude that Howell was \"an integral part\" of General Motors' national system of distribution.
