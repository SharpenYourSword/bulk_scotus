The complaint charged a violation of \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act which forbids combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce among the states. 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 1.<sup>[*]</sup> The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that it failed to state a cause of action on which relief could be granted. At the same time and for the same reason it dismissed a similar complaint charging a Chicago plasterers' association and a local plasterers' union with violating \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act. Both cases were brought here on direct appeal by the Government under authority of 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 29. We have just reversed the District Court's dismissal of the complaint against the plastering group, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Employing Plasterers Assn. of Chicago, ante,</i> p. 186.

The alleged conspiracy here is among these lathing contractors and the union whose members do the actual lathing. This combination, according to the complaint, has achieved almost complete mastery over the lathing business in the Chicago area. It limits the number of lathing contractors, prescribes their qualifications, decides who meets the standards <span class=\"star-pagination\">*200</span> prescribed, excludes persons from the business on varied grounds, including arbitrary racial standards, and assigns plastering contractors to each lathing contractor. All of these allegations and more show a substantial suppression of competition in the lathing business.</blockquote>\n<p>The complaint charges that an effect of the alleged combination and conspiracy has been that \"[i]nterstate trade and commerce in lathing and related building materials has been unlawfully restrained.\" Other allegations emphasize this charge by asserting that any restraint upon lathing work in Chicago \"necessarily and directly restrains and affects the interstate flow of lathing materials, and . . . building materials . . . .\"</p>\n<p>The complaint does state a cause of action on which relief can be granted on proper proof.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<p>[For dissenting opinion of MR.
