Compensating Releases&#8212;The Montague Formula. The City shall release water from its reservoirs as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Until the East Branch reservoir is completed and placed in operation, on the day following each day in which the average flow in the Delaware River falls short of 0.50 cubic feet per second per square mile (c.s.m.), either at Montague, New Jersey (below the mouth of the Neversink River), or at Trenton, New Jersey (0.50 c.s.m. being equivalent to a flow of 1740 cubic feet per second (c.f.s.) at Montague and 3400 c.f.s. at Trenton), the City shall release water from the Neversink reservoir at an average of 0.66 c.s.m. or 61.38 c.f.s.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Upon the completion and placing in operation of the Neversink and East Branch reservoirs, the City shall release water from one or more of its storage reservoirs in the upper Delaware watershed. Such releases shall be in quantities designed to maintain a minimum basic rate of flow at the gaging station of the United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) at Montague of 1525 c.f.s. (985.6 m.g.d.) until the Cannonsville project is completed and its reservoir first filled to the extent that 50 billion gallons above the lowest outlet are available for diversion and release, and of 1750 c.f.s. (1131.1 m.g.d.) thereafter. Compliance by the City with directions of the River Master with respect to such releases shall be considered full compliance with the requirements of this subsection (b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) At the commencement of the calendar year following the completion and placing in operation of the Neversink and East Branch reservoirs and of each calendar year thereafter, the City of New York shall estimate and report to the River Master the anticipated consumption of water during such year to be provided for by the City from all its sources of supply. The City shall, as hereinafter provided, release in the aggregate from all its storage reservoirs in the upper Delaware watershed, in addition to the quantity of water required to be released for the purpose of maintaining the then applicable minimum basic rate of flow as hereinabove provided, a quantity of water equal to 83 per cent of the amount by which the estimated consumption during such year is less than the City's estimate of the continuous safe yield during such year of all its sources obtainable without pumping. In any such year the City's estimate of anticipated consumption shall not exceed by more than 7 1/4 billion gallons the actual consumption in any previous calendar year; and its safe yield in any such year, obtainable without pumping, shall be estimated at not less than 1355 m.g.d. after the Neversink and East Branch reservoirs are put into operation; and at not less than 1665 m.g.d. after the Cannonsville reservoir is put into operation. If, at any time after the completion of the Cannonsville reservoir and prior to the year 1993, the continuous net safe yield for water supply of all of the City's sources of water supply, obtainable without pumping, is increased by the development of additional sources, such greater safe yield shall be used in determining the excess releases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) The City of New York shall release the excess quantity provided for in subsection (c) at rates designed to release the entire quantity in 120 days. Commencing with the fifteenth day of June each year, the excess releases shall continue for as long a period, but not later than the following March 15, as such additional quantity will permit. Such period is hereinafter referred to as the 'seasonal period.' The excess quantity required to be released in any seasonal period shall in no event exceed 70 billion gallons. In releasing the excess quantity specified for any seasonal period, the City shall not be required to maintain a flow at Montague greater than the applicable minimum basic rate plus the excess quantity divided by 120 days, or in any event greater than 2650 c.f.s., nor to release at rates exceeding the capacity of its release works. The City shall in each seasonal period continue its excess releases until March 15 or until the aggregate quantity of the flow at Montague in excess of the basic rate or in excess of such higher rates as are not the result of the City's prior releases, is equal to the total specified excess quantity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(e) The terms and conditions provided in subsections (b), (c) and (d) hereof shall continue to be applicable in all respects in the event that the U.S.G.S. gaging station at Montague shall be relocated at a point below the confluence of the Neversink River with the Delaware River.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Minimum Capacity of Release Works at Reservoirs of City. In constructing the Cannonsville reservoir, the City shall install release works of such capacity as will provide a minimum aggregate release capacity from all its reservoirs in the Delaware River watershed of not less than 1600 c.f.s. under conditions of maximum reservoir depletion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Releases to be Continued in Spite of Interference. In the event that any works hereafter constructed by public or private interests in the watershed of the Delaware River outside of the State of New York shall prevent the proper operation of the U.S.G.S. gaging station at Montague or interfere with the effective operation of the above release requirements by diverting water past the station or by intercepting the natural flow and storing it in reservoirs with an aggregate storage capacity in excess of 25 billion gallons, the City of New York shall continue to make the releases above specified which would be required in the absence of such interference, and appropriate gaging stations shall be established for that purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Inspection Permitted. The States of New Jersey and Delaware and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, through accredited representatives, and the River Master, shall at all reasonable times have the right to inspect the dams, reservoirs and other works constructed by the City of New York, to inspect the diversion areas and the inflow, outflow and diverted flow of such areas, to inspect the meters and other apparatus installed by the City of New York and to inspect all records pertaining to inflow, outflow and diverted flow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IV. Treatment of Port Jervis Sewage. The effluent from the sewage treatment plant at the City of Port Jervis, New York, shall be treated so as to effect a reduction of 85 per cent in the organic impurities and shall be treated with a chemical germicide, or otherwise, so that the B. coli originally present in the sewage shall be reduced by 90 per cent. Untreated industrial waste from plants in the City of Port Jervis shall not be allowed to enter the Delaware and Neversink Rivers. The treatment of such industrial wastes shall be such as to render the effluent practically free from suspended matter and nonputrescent. The treatment of both sewage and industrial waste shall be maintained so long as any diversion is made from the Delaware River or its tributaries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V.

Authorized Diversions. The State of New Jersey may divert outside the Delaware River watershed, from the Delaware River or its tributaries in New Jersey, without compensating releases, the equivalent of 100 m.g.d., if the State shall not, prior to July 1, 1955, repeal Chapter 443 of the New Jersey Laws of 1953, and if, when the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania accepts the conditions as specified in Section 19 of that Chapter, the State of New Jersey shall join with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in requesting the consent of Congress to the agreement embodied in Chapter 443 of the New Jersey Laws of 1953 and an Act of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania accepting the conditions of such New Jersey Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Conditions and Obligations Imposed in Connection with Diversions by New Jersey. The diversions by New Jersey from the Delaware River shall be made under the supervision of the River Master and shall be subject to the following conditions and obligations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Until the State of New Jersey builds and utilizes one or more reservoirs to store waters of the Delaware River or its tributaries for the purpose of diverting the same to another watershed, the State may divert not to exceed 100 m.g.d. as a monthly average, with the diversion on any day not to exceed 120 million gallons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. If and when the State of New Jersey has built and is utilizing one or more reservoirs to store waters of the Delaware River or its tributaries for the purpose of diversion to another watershed, it may withdraw water from the Delaware River or its tributaries into Such impounding reservoirs without limitation except during the months of July, August, September and October of any year, when not more than 100 m.g.d. as a monthly average and not more than 120 million gallons in any day shall be withdrawn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Regardless of whether the State of New Jersey builds and utilizes storage reservoirs for diversion, its total diversion for use outside of the Delaware River watershed without compensating releases shall not exceed an average of 100 m.g.d. during any calendar year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VI. Existing Uses not Affected by Amended Decree. The parties to this proceeding shall have the right to continue all existing uses of the waters of the Delaware River and its tributaries, not involving a diversion outside the Delaware River watershed, in the manner and at the locations presently exercised by municipalities or other governmental agencies, industries or persons in the Delaware River watershed in the States of New York, New Jersey and Delaware and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VIII.

Conditions and Obligations Imposed in Connection With Diversions and Releases by City. The diversions and releases by the City of New York from the Delaware River shall be made under the supervision and direction of the River Master, hereinafter appointed, and shall be subject to the following conditions and obligations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Compensating Releases&#8212;The Montague Formula. The City shall release water from its reservoirs as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Until the East Branch reservoir is completed and placed in operation, on the day following each day in which the average flow in the Delaware River falls short of 0.50 cubic feet per second per square mile (c.s.m.), either at Montague, New Jersey (below the mouth of the Neversink River), or at Trenton, New Jersey (0.50 c.s.m. being equivalent to a flow of 1740 cubic feet per second (c.f.s.) at Montague and 3400 c.f.s. at Trenton), the City shall release water from the Neversink reservoir at an average of 0.66 c.s.m. or 61.38 c.f.s.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Upon the completion and placing in operation of the Neversink and East Branch reservoirs, the City shall release water from one or more of its storage reservoirs in the upper Delaware watershed. Such releases shall be in quantities designed to maintain a minimum basic rate of flow at the gaging station of the United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) at Montague of 1525 c.f.s. (985.6 m.g.d.) until the Cannonsville project is completed and its reservoir first filled to the extent that 50 billion gallons above the lowest outlet are available for diversion and release, and of 1750 c.f.s. (1131.1 m.g.d.) thereafter. Compliance by the City with directions of the River Master with respect to such releases shall be considered full compliance with the requirements of this subsection (b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) At the commencement of the calendar year following the completion and placing in operation of the Neversink and East Branch reservoirs and of each calendar year thereafter, the City of New York shall estimate and report to the River Master the anticipated consumption of water during such year to be provided for by the City from all its sources of supply. The City shall, as hereinafter provided, release in the aggregate from all its storage reservoirs in the upper Delaware watershed, in addition to the quantity of water required to be released for the purpose of maintaining the then applicable minimum basic rate of flow as hereinabove provided, a quantity of water equal to 83 per cent of the amount by which the estimated consumption during such year is less than the City's estimate of the continuous safe yield during such year of all its sources obtainable without pumping. In any such year the City's estimate of anticipated consumption shall not exceed by more than 7 1/4 billion gallons the actual consumption in any previous calendar year; and its safe yield in any such year, obtainable without pumping, shall be estimated at not less than 1355 m.g.d. after the Neversink and East Branch reservoirs are put into operation; and at not less than 1665 m.g.d. after the Cannonsville reservoir is put into operation. If, at any time after the completion of the Cannonsville reservoir and prior to the year 1993, the continuous net safe yield for water supply of all of the City's sources of water supply, obtainable without pumping, is increased by the development of additional sources, such greater safe yield shall be used in determining the excess releases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) The City of New York shall release the excess quantity provided for in subsection (c) at rates designed to release the entire quantity in 120 days. Commencing with the fifteenth day of June each year, the excess releases shall continue for as long a period, but not later than the following March 15, as such additional quantity will permit. Such period is hereinafter referred to as the 'seasonal period.' The excess quantity required to be released in any seasonal period shall in no event exceed 70 billion gallons. In releasing the excess quantity specified for any seasonal period, the City shall not be required to maintain a flow at Montague greater than the applicable minimum basic rate plus the excess quantity divided by 120 days, or in any event greater than 2650 c.f.s., nor to release at rates exceeding the capacity of its release works. The City shall in each seasonal period continue its excess releases until March 15 or until the aggregate quantity of the flow at Montague in excess of the basic rate or in excess of such higher rates as are not the result of the City's prior releases, is equal to the total specified excess quantity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(e) The terms and conditions provided in subsections (b), (c) and (d) hereof shall continue to be applicable in all respects in the event that the U.S.G.S. gaging station at Montague shall be relocated at a point below the confluence of the Neversink River with the Delaware River.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Minimum Capacity of Release Works at Reservoirs of City. In constructing the Cannonsville reservoir, the City shall install release works of such capacity as will provide a minimum aggregate release capacity from all its reservoirs in the Delaware River watershed of not less than 1600 c.f.s. under conditions of maximum reservoir depletion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Releases to be Continued in Spite of Interference. In the event that any works hereafter constructed by public or private interests in the watershed of the Delaware River outside of the State of New York shall prevent the proper operation of the U.S.G.S. gaging station at Montague or interfere with the effective operation of the above release requirements by diverting water past the station or by intercepting the natural flow and storing it in reservoirs with an aggregate storage capacity in excess of 25 billion gallons, the City of New York shall continue to make the releases above specified which would be required in the absence of such interference, and appropriate gaging stations shall be established for that purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Inspection Permitted. The States of New Jersey and Delaware and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, through accredited representatives, and the River Master, shall at all reasonable times have the right to inspect the dams, reservoirs and other works constructed by the City of New York, to inspect the diversion areas and the inflow, outflow and diverted flow of such areas, to inspect the meters and other apparatus installed by the City of New York and to inspect all records pertaining to inflow, outflow and diverted flow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IV. Treatment of Port Jervis Sewage. The effluent from the sewage treatment plant at the City of Port Jervis, New York, shall be treated so as to effect a reduction of 85 per cent in the organic impurities and shall be treated with a chemical germicide, or otherwise, so that the B. coli originally present in the sewage shall be reduced by 90 per cent. Untreated industrial waste from plants in the City of Port Jervis shall not be allowed to enter the Delaware and Neversink Rivers. The treatment of such industrial wastes shall be such as to render the effluent practically free from suspended matter and nonputrescent. The treatment of both sewage and industrial waste shall be maintained so long as any diversion is made from the Delaware River or its tributaries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V.

Authorized Diversions. The State of New Jersey may divert outside the Delaware River watershed, from the Delaware River or its tributaries in New Jersey, without compensating releases, the equivalent of 100 m.g.d., if the State shall not, prior to July 1, 1955, repeal Chapter 443 of the New Jersey Laws of 1953, and if, when the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania accepts the conditions as specified in Section 19 of that Chapter, the State of New Jersey shall join with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in requesting the consent of Congress to the agreement embodied in Chapter 443 of the New Jersey Laws of 1953 and an Act of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania accepting the conditions of such New Jersey Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Conditions and Obligations Imposed in Connection with Diversions by New Jersey. The diversions by New Jersey from the Delaware River shall be made under the supervision of the River Master and shall be subject to the following conditions and obligations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Until the State of New Jersey builds and utilizes one or more reservoirs to store waters of the Delaware River or its tributaries for the purpose of diverting the same to another watershed, the State may divert not to exceed 100 m.g.d. as a monthly average, with the diversion on any day not to exceed 120 million gallons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. If and when the State of New Jersey has built and is utilizing one or more reservoirs to store waters of the Delaware River or its tributaries for the purpose of diversion to another watershed, it may withdraw water from the Delaware River or its tributaries into Such impounding reservoirs without limitation except during the months of July, August, September and October of any year, when not more than 100 m.g.d. as a monthly average and not more than 120 million gallons in any day shall be withdrawn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Regardless of whether the State of New Jersey builds and utilizes storage reservoirs for diversion, its total diversion for use outside of the Delaware River watershed without compensating releases shall not exceed an average of 100 m.g.d. during any calendar year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VI.
