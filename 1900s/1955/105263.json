The insurance companies agreed on the amount of the loss, and they were to share <span class=\"star-pagination\">*216</span> the payment equally. Before the insurance money was paid, a creditor of Adams, the Sunnyland Wholesale Furniture Company, on April 8, 1952, sued Adams on an open account. At the same time, a writ of garnishment was issued and served upon the Liverpool &amp; London &amp; Globe Insurance Company, attaching the insurance funds due and owing Adams. On April 21, 1952, the assessment lists covering the unpaid federal taxes of Adams and his wife for 1948 and 1950 were received in the office of the Collector of Internal Revenue for Texas. On April 26, 1952, notice of tax liens was filed in the office of the county clerk of Bell County, Texas, in favor of the United States for $10,417.57, with interest. Notice of the tax liens with warrants of distraint and notice of levy were served on the respondent insurance company. On June 20, 1952, judgment was entered against Adams in favor of Sunnyland for $2,516.70, with interest and costs. When the garnishee, the respondent insurance company, answered, it named the United States an additional party defendant and requested a determination of priorities of the garnisher and the United States, and asked for reasonable attorney's fees. The amendment was allowed, and the United States was served with process to appear in the state court. On petition of the United States the inter-pleader action was removed to the Northern District of Texas, and the United States was dismissed as a party defendant and permitted to file its complaint for foreclosure of its tax liens. The respondent insurance company paid $7,500.39 into the registry of the court and asked for an attorney's fee of $500. The District Court held the lien of the garnisher superior to the liens of the United States for taxes and allowed the garnishee $500 for attorney's fees. 107 F. Supp. 405.
