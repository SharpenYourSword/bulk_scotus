The Court holds that a federal tax lien has priority over a statutory machanic's lien, even though the mechanic's lien was specific, prior in time, perfected in the sense that everything possible under state law had been done to make it choate, and was being enforced before the federal tax lien arose. The mechanic's lien arose out of a contract to furnish labor and materials for the improvement of the real estate. The contract had been performed, the mechanic's lien recorded for a specific amount, and suit instituted to enforce the lien&#8212;all before the federal taxes were assessed and the tax liens recorded. Moreover, by the time the United States filed the present action to foreclose its tax liens, the mechanic's lien had been reduced to judgment, and the real estate sold at public auction and transferred by the purchaser to others.

City of New Britain, Conn., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105191\"><a href=\"/opinion/105191/united-states-v-city-of-new-britain/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 84, 74 S.Ct. 367, 369, 98 L.Ed. 520, we said that liens under state law were 'perfected in the sense that there is nothing more to be done to have a choate lien&#8212;when the identity of the lienor, the property subject to the lien, and the amount of the lien are established.' Accordingly, we held that the principle that \"the first in time is the first is right\", id., 347 U.S. at page 85, 74 S.Ct. 370, should be applied.
