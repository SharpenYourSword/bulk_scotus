The trust was created for the benefit of the descendants of Bruno Reinicke who, by reason of his powers over the trust and his ownership of the right of reversion, was the real settlor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1945, when this Nation was at war with Germany, the Alien Property Custodian issued an order vesting 'all right, title, interest and claim of any kind or character whatsoever' of the beneficiaries of the trust, declaring that they were nationals of Germany. Subsequently the Custodian (for whom the Attorney General was later substituted) intervened in an action brought by the trustee in the New York courts for a construction of the indenture and for an accounting. Relief sought by that intervention was that the income of the trust be paid to the Attorney General and that the powers reserved to the settlor be held to have passed by virtue of the vesting order to the Attorney General. We are also advised by the report of the case in the Court of Appeals that the Attorney General also claimed that, if the vesting order had not transferred the settlor's powers to the Attorney General, 'then the trust had failed and all of the trust property should pass to the Attorney General under the vesting order as being property of alien enemies.'

On appeal the Appellate Division affirmed. Chase National Bank of City of New York v. McGrath, 276 App.Div. 831, 93 N.Y.S.2d 724. The Court of Appeals in turn affirmed.

In the first litigation, the Attorney General sought to reach the equitable interests in the trust and the powers of the settlor. When the Attorney General now seeks the entire bundle of rights, he is claiming for the most part what was denied him in the first suit. That is not all. In the first suit he claimed that if he were denied the powers which the settlor had over the trust, the trust must fail and all the trust property must be transferred to him. In other words, the Attorney General tendered in the first suit his claim to the entire property. Cf. Young v. Higbee Co., 324 U.S. 204, 208 209, 65 S.Ct. 594, 596&#8212;597, 89 L.Ed. 890.
