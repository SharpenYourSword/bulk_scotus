For reasons elaborated by Mr. Justice Frankfurter at the last Term, 352 U.S. 521, 524, 77 S.Ct. 457, I think that certiorari should have been denied. However, I continue in the view, expressed at the last Term, 35 U.S. 559, 77 S.Ct. 478, that once certiorari has been granted in such cases, we disbelievers, consistent with the Court's certiorari procedure, should consider them on the merits. Further, much as I disagree, 352 U.S. 559, 562&#8212;564, 77 S.Ct. 478&#8212;481, with the reasoning and philosophy of the Rogers case, which strips the historic role of the judge in a jury trial of all meaningful significance, I feel presently bound to bow to it. Applying Rogers to the present cases, I am forced to concur in judgments of reversal in Nos. 142 and 350.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Order amended Jan. 6, 1958, 78 S.Ct. 337, case remanded to Court of Appeals.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>355 U.S. 20 (1957)</b></center>\n<center><h1>PALERMO<br>\nv.<br>\nLUCKENBACH STEAMSHIP CO., INC.</h1></center>\n<center>No. 350.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Decided October 21, 1957.</center>\nON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.\n<p><i>Philip F.
