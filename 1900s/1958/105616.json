It is also true that &#167; 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act does not in terms amend &#167; 2 of the Clayton Act, while &#167; 1 of the Robinson-Patman Act does. 80 Cong.Rec. 9414. The legislative history is further clouded by the fact that certain types of price discriminations are forbidden by both &#167; 1<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and &#167; 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act. Suits for damages on account of these violations plainly are suits for damages under the 'antitrust laws' within the meaning of the enforcement provisions of the Clayton Act. It is only when a violation of &#167; 3 alone is involved that the issue we are concerned with here arises. Yet why allow suits for treble damages for price discrimination under &#167; 2 and not allow them when the discrimination practiced is of the kind condemned by &#167; 3? There is no suggestion that any such line was being drawn by the Congress. The emphasis on the restrictive effect of &#167; 3 relates simply to its criminal sanctions, not to the remedial provisions with which we are presently concerned. When the Conference Report was being considered in the House, Representative Miller, a House Conferee supporting the bill, made the following statements (80 Cong.Rec. 9421):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The penalty of triple damages is the old law.

The first part of the bill has      nothing to do with criminal offenses. It deals primarily, in      my opinion, with the authority of the Federal Trade      Commission to regulate and enforce the provisions of section      2 of the Clayton Act, as amended. Section 3 in the bill is      placed in an effort to make the criminal offense apply only      to that particular section, and I believe that is a      reasonable construction, if you will look at the bill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Mr. Massingale.

Not a word in the legislative history of the Robinson-Patman Act suggests that this special remedy was to be denied to &#167; 3 actions and granted to those under &#167; 2. The fair intendment seems to have been that &#167; 3 was to be added to the body of 'antitrust laws.' The mechanical device used was an amendment to one section of the Clayton Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In resolving all ambiguities against the grant of vitality to &#167; 3, we forget that the treble-damage technique for law enforcement was designed as an effective, if not the most effective, method of deterring violators of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The House Committee on the Judiciary is entrusted by Congress with the preparation and publication of the Code. 1 U.S.C. &#167; 202, 1 U.S.C.A. &#167; 202. That Committee construed &#167; 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act as part of the antitrust laws, for it gave the section number 13a in the Code and provided in &#167; 12 that the term 'antitrust laws' 'includes sections 1&#8212;27 of this title.' That codification establishes 'prima facie the laws of the United States,' 1 U.S.C. &#167; 204(a), 1 U.S.C.A. &#167; 204(a), and the countermanding considerations relied on by the Court do not seem sufficiently persuasive to us to rebut that construction. It indeed accords with what we deem to be the prevailing sentiment in Congress at the time that &#167; 3 became as much a part of the 'antitrust laws' as the other provisions of the Robinson-Patman Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Court notes, it appears that the Department of Justice has never enforced the criminal provisions of &#167; 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act. Because of the Court's holding that &#167; 3 is not available in civil actions to private parties, the statute has in effect been repealed. It is apparent that the opponents of the Robinson-Patman Act have eventually managed to achieve in this Court what they could not do in Congress. We would reverse in No. 67 and affirm in No. 69.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 1 of the Robinson-Patman Act amended and re-enacted &#167; 2 of the Clayton Act.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In determining the legislative intent, reliance can hardly be placed on statements of Representative Patman, made in 1950, some 14 years after the passage of the Robinson-Patman Act, that &#167; 3 of the Act did not amend the Clayton Act.

In other words, it is asserted to me      that the defense allowed under section 2(b) is not permitted      under section 3, although the act or the offense would be the      same.' 80 Cong.Rec. 9903.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reply, Senator Van Nuys, one of the Senate Conferees, did not contest the statement about civil and criminal penalties, but instead addressed his remarks to the contention concerning the defense:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'I think the Senator is mistaken there.

Not a word in the legislative history of the Robinson-Patman Act suggests that this special remedy was to be denied to &#167; 3 actions and granted to those under &#167; 2. The fair intendment seems to have been that &#167; 3 was to be added to the body of 'antitrust laws.' The mechanical device used was an amendment to one section of the Clayton Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In resolving all ambiguities against the grant of vitality to &#167; 3, we forget that the treble-damage technique for law enforcement was designed as an effective, if not the most effective, method of deterring violators of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The House Committee on the Judiciary is entrusted by Congress with the preparation and publication of the Code. 1 U.S.C. &#167; 202, 1 U.S.C.A. &#167; 202. That Committee construed &#167; 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act as part of the antitrust laws, for it gave the section number 13a in the Code and provided in &#167; 12 that the term 'antitrust laws' 'includes sections 1&#8212;27 of this title.' That codification establishes 'prima facie the laws of the United States,' 1 U.S.C. &#167; 204(a), 1 U.S.C.A. &#167; 204(a), and the countermanding considerations relied on by the Court do not seem sufficiently persuasive to us to rebut that construction. It indeed accords with what we deem to be the prevailing sentiment in Congress at the time that &#167; 3 became as much a part of the 'antitrust laws' as the other provisions of the Robinson-Patman Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Court notes, it appears that the Department of Justice has never enforced the criminal provisions of &#167; 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act. Because of the Court's holding that &#167; 3 is not available in civil actions to private parties, the statute has in effect been repealed. It is apparent that the opponents of the Robinson-Patman Act have eventually managed to achieve in this Court what they could not do in Congress. We would reverse in No. 67 and affirm in No. 69.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 1 of the Robinson-Patman Act amended and re-enacted &#167; 2 of the Clayton Act.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In determining the legislative intent, reliance can hardly be placed on statements of Representative Patman, made in 1950, some 14 years after the passage of the Robinson-Patman Act, that &#167; 3 of the Act did not amend the Clayton Act.
