The judgment of the Court of Appeals (244 F. 2d 178) is therefore vacated and the cause is remanded to the District Court with directions to enter an appropriate judgment declaring that petitioner is entitled to have his application for suspension of deportation considered by the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service under \u00a7 244 (a) (1).</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<p>MR.
