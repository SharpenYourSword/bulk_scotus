The only statutory requirement for the allowance of an indigent's appeal is the applicant's \"good faith.\" 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1915.

If counsel is convinced, after conscientious investigation, that the appeal is frivolous, of course, he may ask to withdraw on that account. If the court is satisfied that counsel has diligently investigated the possible grounds of appeal, and agrees with counsel's evaluation of the case, then leave to withdraw may be allowed and leave to appeal may be denied. In this case, the Solicitor General concedes, and after examining the record we agree, that the issue presented\u0097probable cause to arrest\u0097is not one that \"can necessarily be characterized as frivolous.\" Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for reconsideration in light of this opinion.</p>\n</div>",
