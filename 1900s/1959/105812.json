As to cases within this \"twilight zone,\" <i>Davis,</i> in effect, gave an injured waterfront employee an election to recover compensation under either the Longshoremen's Act or the Workmen's Compensation Law of the State in which the injury occurred. It seems plain enough that petitioner's injury occurred in the \"twilight zone,\" and that recovery for it \"through workmen's compensation proceedings,\" could have been, and in fact was, validly \"provided by State law\"\u0097the Oregon Workmen's Compensation Act.

But since his employer had elected to reject them the automatic compensation provisions of the Oregon Workmen's Compensation Act did not apply to the claim. Section 656.024 of that law provides, however, that when an employer has elected to reject the Act's automatic compensation provisions his injured employee may maintain in the courts a negligence action for damages. Of course, the employee could not do this if the case were not within the \"twilight zone,\" for then the Longshoremen's Act would provide the exclusive remedy.
