In a per curiam opinion the Court of Appeals held that 'The record supports at least 5 of the sentences that were to run 'concurrently with' the 3 consecutive sentences. It therefore supports the aggregate sentence. We need not decide whether it supports the 'consecutive' sentences themselves. Hirabayashi v.

'The only sentence known to the law is the sentence or judgment entered upon the records of the court.' Hill v. United States, 298 U.S. 460, 464, 56 S.Ct. 760, 762, 80 L.Ed. 1283. The judgment entered on the records of the court in this case explicitly imposed a separate sentence of from 20 months to the then permissible maximum of 5 years<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> on each of the 15 counts.

But the judgment makes the separate sentences on the other 12 counts to run concurrently with each other (hence for a total period of 20 months to 5 years) and 'with the sentences imposed on Counts Two, Four and Seven,' without saying whether those 'concurrent' sentences are to run with the sentence on Count Two, with the consecutive sentence on Count Four, or with the consecutive sentence on Count Seven. It is therefore evident that the Court of Appeals was in error in concluding that the 5 'concurrent' sentences which it thought were valid alone support an aggregate period of imprisonment of 5 to 15 years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule that reversal is not required if any one of several concurrent sentences is valid and alone supports the sentence and judgment, Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 85, 63 S.Ct. 1375, 1378, 87 L.Ed. 1774; and cases cited; Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 642, note 1, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 1181, 90 L.Ed. 1489; United States v.

United States, 355 U.S. 339, 359, 78 S.Ct. 311, 323, 2 L.Ed.2d 321, does not aid the Government, for no one of the 'concurrent' sentences, or even all of them together, could, even if geared to a particular (though invalid) consecutive sentence, support imprisonment for more than 20 months to 5 years. If any one of the consecutive sentences on Counts Two, Four or Seven be invalid it cannot be said that such of the 'concurrent' sentences as are valid will run with such invalid consecutive sentence, and thus support that much of the aggregate term of imprisonment, because the trial judge did not make the concurrent sentences to run with any particular one of the consecutive sentences. It is therefore clear, under the present sentences, that imprisonment for an aggregate period of 5 to 15 years can be sustained only if each of the consecutive sentences on Counts Two, Four, and Seven is valid. Hence it is necessary for the Court of Appeals to pass upon the validity of the consecutive sentences. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment of Court of Appeals vacated and cause remanded with directions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act, &#167; 2(c), 65 Stat. 767, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 174, 21 U.S.C.A. &#167; 174; the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, &#167;&#167; 4704(a), 4705(a), and 7237(a), 68A Stat. 550&#8212;551, 860, as amended, 69 Stat. 3, 26 U.S.C.

The judgment entered on the records of the court in this case explicitly imposed a separate sentence of from 20 months to the then permissible maximum of 5 years<sup>[3]</sup> on each of the 15 counts. It is therefore plain that the court did not impose one \"gross sentence\" to imprisonment for a period of 5 to 15 years.</p>\n<p>The judgment makes the separate sentences on Counts Two, Four, and Seven to run consecutively. Thus, if each is valid, they in sequence authorize imprisonment for an aggregate period of 5 to 15 years. But the judgment makes the separate sentences on the other 12 counts to run concurrently with each other (hence for a total period of 20 months to 5 years) <i>and</i> \"with the sentences imposed on Counts Two, Four and Seven,\" without saying whether <span class=\"star-pagination\">*330</span> those \"concurrent\" sentences are to run with the sentence on Count Two, with the consecutive sentence on Count Four, or with the consecutive sentence on Count Seven. It is therefore evident that the Court of Appeals was in error in concluding that the 5 \"concurrent\" sentences which it thought were valid alone support an aggregate period of imprisonment of 5 to 15 years.</p>\n<p>The rule that reversal is not required if any one of several concurrent sentences is valid and alone supports the sentence and judgment, <i>Hirabayashi</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 320 U. S. 81, 85, and cases cited; <i>Pinkerton</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 328 U. S. 640, 642, n. 1; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Sheridan,</i> 329 U. S. 379, 381; <i>Roviaro</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 353 U. S. 53, 59, n. 6; <i>Lawn</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 355 U. S. 339, 359, does not aid the Government, for no one of the \"concurrent\" sentences, or even all of them together, could, even if geared to a particular (though invalid) consecutive sentence, support imprisonment for more than 20 months to 5 years. If any one of the consecutive sentences on Counts Two, Four or Seven be invalid it cannot be said that such of the \"concurrent\" sentences as are valid will run with such invalid consecutive sentence, and thus support that much of the aggregate term of imprisonment, because the trial judge did not make the concurrent sentences to run with any particular one of the consecutive sentences. It is therefore clear, under the present sentences, that imprisonment for an aggregate period of 5 to 15 years can be sustained only if each of the consecutive sentences on Counts Two, Four, and Seven is valid. Hence it is necessary for the Court of Appeals to pass upon the validity of the consecutive sentences. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act, § 2 (c), 65 Stat. 767, 21 U.
