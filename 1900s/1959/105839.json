It was tried before a single district judge. After trial the district judge wrote an opinion (154 F. Supp. 736) and then entered a judgment which <span class=\"star-pagination\">*640</span> declared the statute in conflict with the State and Federal Constitutions and thus beyond the power of the Mississippi Legislature to enact. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the District Court. 256 F. 2d 83. An appeal was taken to this Court pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1254 (2), providing for appeal of a decision of a Court of Appeals where appellant relies on a state statute held to be \"invalid as repugnant to the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States.\" Appellee moved to dismiss the appeal, contending that review by appeal does not lie because the Court of Appeals decision declaring the state statute unconstitutional was based on the Constitution of Mississippi as well as the Federal Constitution. Subsequently, appellant moved the Court to vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the District Court with instructions to vacate its judgment and convene a three-judge court under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2281 and 2284 to consider appellee's complaint. Appellee opposed the motion. Without passing judgment on the merits of that motion (cf. <i>Federal Housing Administration</i> v. <i>The Darlington, Inc.,</i> 352 U. S. 977), we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the District Court with directions to hold the cause while the parties repair to a state tribunal for an authoritative declaration of applicable state law.</p>\n<p>Proper exercise of federal jurisdiction requires that controversies involving unsettled questions of state law be decided in the state tribunals preliminary to a federal court's consideration of the underlying federal constitutional questions. See <i>Railroad Comm'n</i> v. <i>Pullman Co.,</i> 312 U. S. 496. That is especially desirable where the questions of state law are enmeshed with federal questions. <i>Spector Motor Co.</i> v. <i>McLaughlin,</i> 323 U. S. 101, 105.

Cf. <i>Thompson</i> v. <i>Magnolia Petroleum Co.,</i> 309 U. S. 478, 483.
