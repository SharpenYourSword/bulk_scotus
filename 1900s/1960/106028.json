Six roads so engaged have filed tariffs covering such services at the same rate as their fast freight, and the Interstate Commerce Commission now has such tariffs under investigation and consideration.

The District Court found that appellant renders a 14-day delayed lumber service over a route ordinarily requiring from two to four days. The delay is accomplished by the holding of cars on sidings at certain points on its trunk lines awaiting diversion orders to move the shipment forward over the railroad's regular service. This affords the shipper additional time to find a market for the lumber while it is in transit. This service, the District Court found, incurred additional \"operational problems and costs\" for appellant, including switching, siding, storage and \"per diem cost for the use of foreign cars\" not present in its fast freight service and not included in its published tariff. We agree with the District Court that such delayed service constitutes the furnishing of additional \"privileges or facilities\" under \u00a7 6 (7) of the Interstate Commerce Act, and, therefore, must be published and filed in its tariff. 49 U.
