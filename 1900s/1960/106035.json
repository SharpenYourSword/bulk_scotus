In the Finnish Hall or anywhere else did you attend Communist Party meetings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"A. Well, if I said yes and if I said no maybe I wouldn't be telling the truth, because I really couldn't tell one way or the other. I went to meetings there. Sometimes maybe they were Communist, and maybe they wasn't. It could have been and maybe they wasn't.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Q. Have you been a member of the Communist Party of the United States or any branch or affiliate or organization by that name or any similar name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"A. Knowingly, I haven't, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Q. Do you believe that membership in the Communist Party now is a lawful political purpose?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"A. No. I can't answer questions about that because I don't know. If Congress says it is unlawful, it is unlawful. If it isn't, it isn't. I don't know. If I got the question right, I don't know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*394</span> \"Q. I am not trying to confuse you, . . . I am trying to find out your feelings toward Communism.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"A. Naturally I don't\u0097Communism or socialism, I don't care what party it is here or any place else, if it has anything to do with overthrowing the government by force and violence I don't agree with it, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Q. What was your impression of what the Communist Party was trying to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"A. Well, the only thing I heard in those days was more relief and more work, and I never heard anything else; no violent overthrow of the Government, or anything of that sort, but anyplace I went to meetings was always more work and more food.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Q. As far as you know, that was what the Communist Party stood for during that period?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"A. I don't know if they stood for that, but I never heard anything against it.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The case is on all fours with <i>Rowoldt</i> v. <i>Perfetto,</i> 355 U. S. 115. The \"solidity of proof\" (<i>id.,</i> at 120) required for the severe consequences of the deportation of a man who came here when he was less than one year old, whose only memory of life is in this land, and who has lived here over 50 years has not been met. The \"meaningful association\" with the Party which the <i>Rowoldt</i> case requires (<i>id.,</i> at 120) simply has not been established here. In this case, as in <i>Rowoldt,</i> petitioner's association with the Party was \"wholly devoid of any `political' implications.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 120.</p>\n<p>The testimony of the two ex-Communists upon which petitioner is being banished has never been heard by a court. The only testimony taken by the District Court was that of the petitioner and his character witnesses. The district judge believed the witnesses against Niukkanen <span class=\"star-pagination\">*395</span> by virtue of having read the same record that is now before this Court. His impression of their credibility can be no more reliable than our own. Certainly then his conclusion that petitioner \"perjured himself before, and . . . perjured himself today\" does not preclude this Court's review of the evidence against him. Apart from that, the evidence would be far too meagre to establish the \"meaningful association\" which we required in the <i>Rowoldt</i> case.</p>\n<p>The unanimity of all the finders of fact in the <i>Rowoldt</i> case (<i>id.,</i> at 119) that Rowoldt was a \"member\" of the Party and his refusal to answer when asked in the deportation proceedings whether he had ever been a member of the Communist Party, did not stop us from declaring that \"the record before us is all too insubstantial to support the order of deportation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 121. The unanimity of the finders of fact in the present case should likewise be no barrier to our entry of a just decree. A man who has lived here for every meaningful month of his entire life should not be sent into exile for acts which this record reveals were utterly devoid of any sinister implication.</p>\n</div>",

In the Finnish Hall or anywhere else did you attend      Communist Party meetings? A. Well, if I said yes and if I      said no maybe I wouldn't be telling the truth, because I      really couldn't tell one way or the other. I went to meetings      there. Sometimes maybe they were Communist, and maybe they      wasn't. It could have been and maybe they wasn't.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Q. Have you been a member of the Communist Party of the      United States or any branch or affiliate or organization by      that name or any similar name? A.

Do you believe that membership in the Communist Party now      is a lawful political purpose? A. No. I can't answer      questions about that because I don't know. If Congress says      it is unlawful, it is unlawful. If it isn't, it isn't. I      don't know. If I got the question right, I don't know.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Q. I am not trying to confuse you, * * * I am trying to           find out your feelings toward Communism. A. Naturally I           don't&#8212;Communism or socialism, I don't care what party it           is here or any place else, if it has anything to do with           overthrowing the government by force and violence I           don't agree with it, no.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Q. What was your impression of what the Communist Party was      trying to do? A. Well, the only thing I heard in those days      was more relief and more work, and I never heard anything      else; no violent overthrow of the Government, or anything of      that sort, but anyplace I went to meetings was always more      work and more food.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Q.

Perfetto, 355 U.S. 115, 78 S.Ct. 180, 2 L.Ed.2d 140. The 'solidity of proof' (id., 355 U.S. at page 120, 78 S.Ct. at page 183) required for the severe consequences of the deportation of a man who came here when he was less than one year old, whose only memory of life is in this land, and who has lived here over 50 years has not been met. The 'meaningful association' with the Party which the Rowoldt case requires (355 U.S. at page 120, 78 S.Ct. at page 183) simply has not been established here. In this case, as in Rowoldt, petitioner's association with the Party was 'wholly devoid of any 'political' implications.' 355 U.S. at page 120, 78 S.Ct. at page 183.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testimony of the two ex-Communists upon which petitioner is being banished has never been heard by a court. The only testimony taken by the District Court was that of the petitioner and his character witnesses. The district judge believed the witnesses against Niukkanen, by virtue of having read the same record that is now before this Court. His impression of their credibility can be no more reliable than our own. Certainly then his conclusion that petitioner 'perjured himself before, and * * * perjured himself today' does not preclude this Court's review of the evidence against him. Apart from that, the evidence would be far too meagre to establish the 'meaningful association' which we required in the Rowoldt case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The unanimity of all the finders of fact in the Rowoldt case (355 U.S. at page 119, 78 S.Ct. at page 182) that Rowoldt was a 'member' of the Party and his refusal to answer when asked in the deportation proceedings whether he had ever been a member of the Communist Party, did not stop us from declaring that 'the record before us is all too insubstantial to support the order of deportation.' 355 U.S. at page 121, 78 S.Ct. at page 184. The unanimity of the finders of fact in the present case should likewise be no barrier to our entry of a just decree. A man who has lived here for every meaningful month of his entire life should not be sent into exile for acts which this record reveals were utterly devoid of any sinister implication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Now 8 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1251(a)(6)(C).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
