After our remand to the Court of Appeals of the State of Ohio, Ninth Judicial District, for proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion of this Court, 358 U.

Art. XXXII, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5, 358 U. S., at 298-299. While we do not think the issue was tendered to us when the case was last here, we are of opinion that these provisions are at least as intimately bound up with the subject of wages as the minimum rental provisions we passed on then. Accordingly, as in the previous case, we hold that Ohio's antitrust law here may not \"be applied to prevent the contracting parties from carrying out their agreement upon a subject matter as to which federal law directs them to bargain.\" 358 U.
