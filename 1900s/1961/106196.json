After hearing oral argument, and upon full consideration of the case, we find that the record does not adequately establish that the Virginia court found or was required to find that there was presented to it the federal claim on which the case was brought here.

At the trial, petitioner had been represented by counsel, although at allocution he had complained that his counsel had failed to present relevant evidence. On April 18, 1953, petitioner wrote to the trial judge at his trial,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> noting an appeal within the time allowed therefor under Virginia law. In a second letter written five days later,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> petitioner requested 'that you appoint me counsel to appeal my case to the State Supreme Court of Appeals.'

He took no further steps to appeal his conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1959 he filed in the Virginia court a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The Law and Equity Court of Richmond concluded that the petition did not allege 'a failure of the trial court to accord to the accused those procedural safeguards guaranteed to him by the state and federal constitutions,' and accordingly denied the writ. Petitioner sought review by the Supreme Court of Appeals, and that court refused to issue a writ of error. Then petitioner sought review here, and certiorari was granted. 363 U.S. 802, 80 S.Ct. 1240, 4 L.Ed.2d 1146.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question raised by petitioner is substantial: Does the Federal Constitution obligate the several States to appoint counsel to assist indigent defendants to pursue whatever appellate remedies the States may offer?

After an extended discussion of the right of indigents to counsel, that court quoted from 55 A.L.R.2d at page 1085, 2 L.Ed.2d at page 1649, the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'* * * Thus, the establishment of the rule that a state must,      as a matter of federal constitutional law, provide indigents      with the assistance of counsel to prosecute appeals in      criminal cases would appear to be no more than a logical      extension of the Griffin doctrine.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">It then added:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Whether this view be correct or incorrect is, of course, the      question in the instant case.'
