There we held that an oath which required a teacher to say he had never knowingly lent his \"aid\" or \"support\" or \"advice\" or \"counsel\" or \"influence\" to the Communist Party was unconstitutional, because it brought or might bring into its net people who, by parallelism of conduct, might be said to have given \"aid\" to the Communist Party though the cause they espoused was wholly lawful.</p>\n<p>This oath presents the question whether one who plans to \"alter\" the Government of the United States by \"revolution\" or who knowingly belongs to a group that sponsors <span class=\"star-pagination\">*438</span> that idea can be disqualified as a teacher. To \"alter\" has been the objective of many who have proposed constitutional amendments. The idea of \"revolution\" is an American concept<sup>[2]</sup> that at least until recently has been greatly reversed.

Whether they can preserve in an administrative proceeding the full array of constitutional questions which they now tender is at least debatable, since the judgment that dismisses their complaint decides all the constitutional questions, except the right to a hearing, against them.</p>\n<p>For the reasons I dissent from the disposal made of the case and vote to note jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated by MR.
