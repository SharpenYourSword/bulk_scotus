Plaintiffs have appealed, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1253, 28 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1253; N.A.A.C.P. v. Bennett, 360 U.S. 471, 79 S.Ct. 1192, 3 L.Ed.2d 1375.

But as passengers using the segregated transportation facilities they are aggrieved parties and have standing to enforce their rights to nonsegregated treatment. Mitchell v.

Section 2281 does not require a three-judge court when the claim that a statute is unconstitutional is wholly insubstantial, legally speaking nonexistent.

We denied leave to file petitions for mandamus in Bush, 351 U.S. 948, 76 S.Ct. 854, 100 L.Ed. 1472, and from a similar ruling in Booker v. Tennessee Board of Education, 351 U.S. 948, 76 S.Ct. 856, 100 L.Ed. 1472. The reasons for convening an extraordinary court are inapplicable in such cases, for the policy behind the three-judge requirement&#8212;that a single judge ought not to be empowered to invalidate a state statute under a federal claim&#8212;does not apply. The three-judge requirement is a technical one to be narrowly construed, Phillips v. United States, 312 U.S. 246, 251, 61 S.Ct. 480, 483, 85 L.Ed. 800. The statute comes into play only when an injunction is sought 'upon the ground of the unconstitutionality' of a statute.
