By what authority can government compel one person not to work on Sunday because the majority of the populace deems Sunday to be a holy day? Moslems may someday control a state legislature.

Those scruples, no matter how bizarre <span class=\"star-pagination\">*220</span> they might seem to some, are within the ambit of the First Amendment. . . . Is it possible that a majority of a state legislature having those religious scruples could make it criminal for the nonbeliever to sell pork? Some have religious scruples against slaughtering cattle. Could a state legislature, dominated by that group, make it criminal to run an abattoir? . . . A legislature of Christians can no more make minorities conform to their weekly regime than a legislature of Moslems, or a legislature of Hindus. The religious regime of every group must be respected\u0097unless it crosses the line of criminal conduct. But no one can be forced to come to a halt before it, or refrain from doing things that would offend it. That is my reading of the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause.\" 366 U. S., at 575.</blockquote>\n<p>The religious nature of this state regulation is emphasized by the fact that it exempts \"members of a religious society\" who actually observe the Sabbath on a day other than Sunday. The law is thus plainly an aid to all organized religions, bringing to heel anyone who violates the religious scruples of the majority by seeking his salvation not through organized religion but on his own.</p>\n<p>I see no possible way by which this law can be sustained under the First Amendment.</p>\n<blockquote>\". . . if a religious leaven is to be worked into the affairs of our people, it is to be done by individuals and groups, not by the Government.
