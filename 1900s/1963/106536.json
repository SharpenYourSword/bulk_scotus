[an] Act of Congress\"\u0097\u00a7 352 (a) (1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1484 (a) (1), which provides that a naturalized <span class=\"star-pagination\">*225</span> American citizen shall lose his nationality by \"having a continuous residence for three years in the territory of a foreign state of which he was formerly a national or in which the place of his birth is situated . . . .\" The District Court concluded that petitioner's complaint presented no substantial constitutional issue and denied petitioner's motion to convene a three-judge court, relying on <i>Lapides</i> v. <i>Clark,</i> 85 U. S. App. D. C. 101, 176 F. 2d 619 (1949), cert. denied, 338 U.

C. \u00a7 1484 (a) (2), which deprived the naturalized American of his citizenship for residing for five years in any foreign state. The Court of Appeals' <i>per curiam</i> affirmance was also based on <i>Lapides.</i> Although no view is here intimated as to the merits of the constitutional question in the present case, we disagree with the conclusion of the courts below as to the substantiality of that issue. The intervening decisions of this Court in <i>Perez</i> v. <i>Brownell,</i> 356 U. S. 44, and <i>Trop</i> v. <i>Dulles,</i> 356 U.
