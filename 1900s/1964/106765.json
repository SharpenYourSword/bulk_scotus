In that application the remedies of certiorari,<sup>[2]</sup> mandamus and prohibition were sought alternatively for denial of a preliminary examination and for having to stand trial under the Vagrancy Act.</p>\n<p>In that application the petitioner said:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The bill of information charged no criminal offense, and if it did set forth an alleged offense in the language of a statute, then such statute and the bill of information are unconstitutional, null and void, being violative of both Federal and State Constitutions.\"</blockquote>\n<p>In the prayer for relief contained in the application he asked in the alternative that the Court rule \"upon the constitutionality\" of the vagrancy statute and whether it and other Louisiana statutes and constitutional provisions cited \"are contrary to and violative of the provisions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*338</span> of the United States Constitution, and in particular the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments thereto.\"</p>\n<p>Thus when petitioner sought review of the denial of a preliminary hearing, he tried to raise the question of the constitutionality of the vagrancy statute.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court denied the writs on March 16, 1962, saying \"Writ refused. There is no error of law in the ruling complained of.\" The petition for certiorari to this Court was filed March 31, 1962. Two months later, <i>i. e.,</i> May 31, 1962, petitioner appeared in the Lafayette city court (to which the case had been transferred by the District Court) and pleaded guilty to the charge of vagrancy. He was then sentenced to serve four months in jail, but given credit for the time served and forthwith discharged. We granted certiorari, 372 U.

Under our decisions in the criminal field, such denial of intermediate relief in state criminal cases is similar to an order overruling a plea in bar (<i>Eastman</i> v. <i>Ohio,</i> 299 U.
