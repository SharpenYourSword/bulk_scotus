JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>Both the rule adopted by the lower court and that now announced by this Court seem to me unacceptable. On the one hand, it impinges on the rights assured by §§ 7 and 8 (a) (1) to hold, as the Court of Appeals did, that the employee must bear the entire brunt of his honest, but mistaken, discharge. On the other hand, it is hardly fair that the employer should be faced with the choice of risking damage to his business or incurring a penalty for taking honest action to thwart it.</p>\n<p>Between these two one-way streets lies a middle two-way course: a rule which would require reinstatement of the mistakenly discharged employee and back pay only as of the time that the employer learned, or should have learned, of his mistake, subject, however, to a valid business reason for refusing reinstatement.<sup>[1]</sup> Such a rule gives offense neither to any policy of the statute nor to the dictates of fairness to the employer, and in my opinion represents a reasonable accommodation between the two inflexible points of view evinced by the opinions below and here.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> Since I do not believe that this case presents the rare situation in which the Board can ignore motive,<sup>[2]</sup> I would vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the Board for further appropriate proceedings in light of what I believe to be the proper rule.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Sections 8 (a) (1) and (3) read as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\"It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer</p>\n<p>\"(1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7;</p>\n<p>.....</p>\n<p>\"(3) by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization . . . .\"</p>\n<p>[2]  As an alternative ground for its finding that the Act had been violated, the Board held that Pate's allegation was merely \"seized up[on]\" by the respondent as an \"excuse\" for the discharges of Davis and Harmon. 137 N. L. R. B. 766, 772-773. The Court of Appeals, however, rejected without discussion this suggestion of the existence of anti-union bias. 322 F. 2d 57, 59, 61. In its petition for writ of certiorari the Board expressly stated that \"The propriety of this action [by the Court of Appeals] is not questioned here.\" In light of this concession it is unnecessary for us to determine whether the Board's alternative finding of a discriminatory motivation is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p>[3]  The <i>Rubin Bros.</i> case made a qualification as to burden of proof. Prior thereto the burden was on the employer to prove that the discharged employee was in fact guilty of the misconduct. <i>Rubin Bros.</i> said that \"once such an honest belief is established, the General Counsel must go forward with evidence to prove that the employees did not, in fact, engage in such misconduct.\" 99 N. L. R. B., at 611.</p>\n<p>[1]  As for example, if a replacement had been hired and the discharged employee unduly delayed in apprising the employer of the mistake.</p>\n<p>[2]  See <i>Teamsters Local</i> v. <i>Labor Board,</i> 365 U. S. 667, 677 (1961) (concurring opinion). Respondent here had a significant business justificationto avoid dynamiting of a silofor discharging the employees, unlike the situations presented in <i>Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co.</i> v. <i>Labor Board,</i> 162 F. 2d 435; <i>Cusano</i> v. <i>Labor Board,</i> 190 F. 2d 898, and <i>Labor Board</i> v. <i>Industrial Cotton Mills,</i> 208 F. 2d 87. See <i>Teamsters Local, supra,</i> at 680.\n</p>\n<p>In <i>Allis-Chalmers</i> the employer downgraded the status of plant inspectors after they had voted to join a union, and it was apparent that the employer acted only because of the inspectors' membership in the union. There was no business justification for the employer's action except for his feeling that union members should not exercise supervisory powers and the Board was therefore justified in treating this as an unfair labor practice without a specific finding of discriminatory motive.</p>\n<p><i>Cusano</i> involved a mistaken belief by the employer that an employee had made a misstatement about company profits, which might well have been protected campaign \"oratory\" even if the employee had made the misstatement. Since the employer could simply have denied the truth of the profit figures, there was no business justification for discharging the employee.</p>\n<p><i>Industrial Cotton Mills</i> presents the closest analogy to the case before us. There an employee was refused reinstatement following a strike for alleged strike misconductthrowing tacks on the street during a strikewhich he did not commit. The Court of Appeals recognized the special congressional concern for the right to strike embodied in §§ 2 (3) and 13 of the Act, and held that the employer's lack of antiunion motive was irrelevant. There was also little business justification for punishing the employee after the strike had ended, unlike the fear in this case of future sabotage by the employees.</p>\n\n</div>", "id": 106928, "judges": "Douglas", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/106928/", "sha1": "fadde19916d34b8ab86ac3c48d1e08d7db4dddac", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": "1964-001", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T10:10:50"}
