JUSTICE GOLDBERG, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>This appeal raises the question of whether a person charged with a traffic violation (or presumably any other criminal offense) may be forced by a statute, General Laws of Mass., c. 90, §§ 20 and 20A, to choose between foregoing a trial by pleading guilty and paying a small fine, or going to trial and thereby exposing himself to the possibility of a greater punishment if found guilty. I express no view on the merits of this question. But I would note probable jurisdiction, since the issue, in my view, presents a substantial federal question, and since I am not convinced that the generally sound advice to \"pay the two dollars\" necessarily reflects a constitutionally permissible requirement.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE is of the opinion that probable jurisdiction should be noted.</p>\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "", "id": 2620955, "judges": "Per Curiam", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2620955/", "sha1": "84e094f226ec0f2f5ef84c117b1b7653857063ff", "source": "L", "time_retrieved": "2013-11-01T13:08:22.651782"}
