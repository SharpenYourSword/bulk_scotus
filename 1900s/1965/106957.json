Armstrong, Secretary of State, the Town Clerks of      the Towns of Vermont, and the County Clerks of the Counties      of Vermont, and their respective successors in office, are      perpetually enjoined from doing any act or taking any steps      in furtherance of nominating or holding elections of senators      or representatives to the Senate or House of Representatives      of the State of Vermont pursuant to said method, and said      defendants are further enjoined from certifying or in any      other manner declaring that the results of such nominations      or elections are valid or that the General Assembly of the      State of Vermont which, if constitutionally elected, would be      convened on January 6, 1965, is properly or legally      constituted, unless by some other authorized lawful and      constitutional method Senators and Representatives are      nominated and elected to the Senate and House of      Representatives of the State of Vermont pursuant to a      reapportionment or redistricting of the House of      Representatives to be effected promptly, such reapportionment      or redistricting of the Senate and reapportionment or      redistricting of the House of Representatives having been      done in such manner as to achieve substantial equality in the      choice of members of the General Assembly as guaranteed by      the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of      the United States Constitution. It is, however, permissible      for the September 1964 primary elections for nominees for the      offices of Senators and Representatives and for the general      elections to be held on November 3, 1964 to be conducted as      presently scheduled to be conducted, and if, in the meantime,      no members shall have been chosen by a constitutionally valid      method, the members of the General Assembly chosen as heretofore may convene on January      6, 1965, provided that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'(a) A reapportionment bill or bills be introduced in at      least one House of the General Assembly by February 1, 1965.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'(b) Should the General Assembly desire to submit the matter      of reapportionment to a constitutional convention,      legislation shall be enacted on or before March 1, 1965 to      provide for the convening of a constitutional convention on      or before June 1, 1965.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'(c) Should legislation be enacted setting up a      constitutional convention, said convention shall finish its      deliberations by September 1, 1965.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'(d) If the matter of reapportionment is not referred to a      constitutional convention, reapportionment legislation shall      be enacted so as to comply with the mandate of the Court on      or before July 1, 1965.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'(e) The General Assembly shall be empowered to enact all      legislation as usual for the operation of state, town and      county governments between January 6, 1965 and July 1, 1965.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'(f) If reapportionment legislation is not enacted by July 1,      1965, and if a constitutional convention shall fail to      reapportion the General Assembly by September 1, 1965, the      Court shall reapportion the General Assembly so as to comply      with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment      to the United States Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'(g) In any event, a reapportioned General Assembly shall      have been elected and ready to serve by the first Wednesday      after the first Monday in January, 1966.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'(h) The terms of office of the members to the 1965 General      Assembly shall expire on July 1, 1965, except that their      offices may continue if called into special session by the Governor of the State of Vermont to      act upon a State emergency not pertaining to      reapportionment.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cases are removed from the argument list, the Stipulation is approved, and, in accordance therewith, the judgment of the District Court is modified by vacating Paragraph (3) and substituting in lieu thereof the quoted language of the Stipulation. As so modified, the judgment of the District Court dated August 3, 1964, is affirmed. The judgment of this Court shall issue forthwith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Memorandum of Mr. Justice HARLAN.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would approve the Stipulation submitted by the parties except for subparagraph (f). That provision envisages a reapportioment of the Vermont Legislature by the District Court itself if an apportionment of that body, satisfying the requirements of Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506, is not accomplished by the other means, and within the timetable, set forth in the Stipulation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The prospect of the federal courts engaging in such a political undertaking is for me a spectacle not easy to contemplate. Whether such a course may be an inevitable ultimate consequence of Reynolds v. Sims is a matter which should be determined only after the fullest and most deliberate consideration on the part of this Court. Cf. Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 495&#8212;496, 74 S.Ct. 686, 692-693, 98 L.Ed. 873, and 349 U.S. 294, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083. I do not believe that any of the summary dispositions made in reapportionment cases following Reynolds v. Sims, see, e.g., Williams v. Moss, 378 U.S. 558, 84 S.Ct. 1907, 12 L.Ed.2d 1026, forecloses or obviates the need for such a consideration of this farreaching question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The parties to a particular litigation should not be permitted by stipulation to thrust a federal court into this foreign activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Except in the foregoing respects, I join in the Court's disposition of the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> '(f) If reapportionment legislation is not enacted by July 1, 1965, and if a constitutional convention shall fail to reapportion the General Assembly by September 1, 1965, the Court shall reapportion the General Assembly so as to comply with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.'</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The District Court in its order of August 3, 1964, declined to pass on this question. Paragraph (4) of the order read:</p>\n        <p>'(4) No action is taken now upon the alternative request of plaintiffs that this court order that elections of Senators and Representatives be on a state-wide basis; and jurisdiction is retained for the entry of such further orders as may be necessary and proper hereafter.' 234 F.Supp. 191, 201.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
