Petitioner contends that the venturers' intention was to develop and operate an apartment project on the land; the respondent's position is that there was a 'dual purpose' of developing the property for rental purposes or selling, whichever proved to be the more profitable. In any event, difficulties in obtaining the necessary financing were encountered, and the interior lots of the tract were subdivided and sold.
