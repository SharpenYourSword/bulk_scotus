Appellants in this case, Lomenzo et al., challenge other aspects of the same judgment, and all parties now agree that, as to those aspects, the judgment of the District Court has been rendered moot by the actions of the Court of Appeals of New York in <i>In the Matter of Orans,</i> 17 N. Y. 2d 107, 216 N. E. 2d 311 (1966), and <i>In the Matter of Orans,</i> 15 N. Y. 2d 339, 206 N. E. 2d 854, appeal dismissed 382 U. S. 10 (1965). Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is vacated as moot insofar as it concerns the issues here appealed, namely, whether N. Y. Laws 1964, cc. 977-978, 979, 981, are violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, and whether the District Court was entitled to rely on provisions of the New York Constitution possibly affected by the action of this Court in <i>WMCA, Inc.</i> v. <i>Lomenzo,</i> 377 U. S. 633.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE FORTAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n</div>",
