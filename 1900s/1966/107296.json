Accepting the District Court's decision to set aside the Commission's order on the merits, appellants challenge that portion of the judgment which instructs the Commission to grant relief to the appellee and precludes the Commission from reopening the proceedings for the receipt of additional evidence relevant to the question whether the rates challenged by the appellee are in fact unreasonably preferential in violation of &#167; 3(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. &#167; 3(1). We agree with the appellants that, under the circumstances present here, this restriction is an improper limitation on the Commission's duty to reconsider the entire case. Arrow Transp. Co. v. Cincinnati, N.O. &amp; T.P.R. Co., 379 U.S. 642, 85 S.Ct. 610, 13 L.Ed.2d 550.
