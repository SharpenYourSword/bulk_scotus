JUSTICE FORTAS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is a companion case to No. 176, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Laub, ante,</i> p. 475. Petitioner was tried on a stipulation of facts, under an indictment which alleged that on two occasions she \"did unlawfully, knowingly and willfully depart from the United States without bearing a valid passport, for the Republic of Cuba, via Mexico, the Republic of Cuba being a place outside the United States for which a valid passport is required\" in violation of \u00a7 215 (b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 190, 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1185 (b). The parties stipulated that \"At no time pertinent or material herein did defendant. Helen Maxine Levi Travis, bear a valid <span class=\"star-pagination\">*492</span> United States passport specifically endorsed for travel to the Republic of Cuba . . . .\" This stipulation is all that the record in this case reveals as to petitioner's possession of a valid passport. Petitioner was convicted, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

We have today held that area restrictions upon the use of an otherwise valid passport are not criminally enforceable under \u00a7 215 (b). Because the Government did not allege, and introduced no proof, that petitioner did not bear a valid passport on each of the occasions on which she departed for Cuba, via Mexico, our decision in <i>Laub, supra,</i> requires that her conviction be reversed.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n</div>",
