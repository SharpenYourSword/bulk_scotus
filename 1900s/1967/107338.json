Pursuant to &#167; 10(j) of the Act the Regional Director also obtained a temporary injunction in the District Court for the Southern District of New York restraining the company from '(f)ailing or refusing to meet, confer and bargain collectively in good faith with * * * (IUE) by declining to meet with the selected representatives of * * * (IUE) because of the presence of any representatives of other unions whom IUE and its constituent locals have invited to attend for the purpose of participating in the discussion and advising or consulting with IUE and its constituent locals.' The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. 366 F.2d 847.

The District Court applied a dual test: (1) whether 'the impact upon the public interest is grave enough to justify swifter corrective action than the normal process of Board adjudication and court enforcement,' 257 F.Supp. 690, 708, and (2) 'whether the Board has 'reasonable cause to believe' that the accused party has been guilty of unfair labor practices.' 257 F.Supp., at 709.

We think that the District Court should determine in the first instance the effect of this supervening event upon the appropriateness of injunctive relief. The controversy over the proper standard for injunctive relief is immaterial if such relief is now improper whichever standard is applied. We therefore dissolve the stay granted by Mr. Justice Harlan and set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeals with direction to enter a new judgment setting aside the order of the District Court and remanding to that court for such further proceedings as may be appropriate in light of the supervening event.
