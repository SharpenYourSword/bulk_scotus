But the Court of Appeals denied petitioner's motion for the same relief or, alternatively, for a remand to the District Court for an evidentiary hearing to determine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> whether he was prejudiced by the monitoring; the Court of Appeals stated, however, that the motion was denied \"without prejudice to such application by him to the District Court as may be appropriate.\" In the circumstances of this case, and in light of the acknowledgment of the Solicitor General in his brief in opposition that \"the F.

We therefore vacate petitioner's conviction and remand to the District Court with direction to afford petitioner such an evidentiary hearing.
