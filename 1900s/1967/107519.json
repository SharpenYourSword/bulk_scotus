S. 129, 133. Petitioner was thereupon afforded an evidentiary hearing on his allegations. Although the evidence was in dispute regarding the inclusion of Negroes in the grand and petit jury venires in the county in which petitioner was indicted and tried, it appeared that no Negro served on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> the grand jury which indicted or the petit jury which convicted petitioner. It further appeared that up to the time of petitioner's trial, no Negro had ever served on a grand jury panel and few, if any, Negroes had served on petit jury panels. This \"testimony in itself made out a <i>prima facie</i> case of the denial of the equal protection which the Constitution guarantees.\" <i>Norris</i> v. <i>Alabama,</i> 294 U. S. 587, 591.
