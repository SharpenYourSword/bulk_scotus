Their complaint alleged that New York's congressional districting statute does not conform to the requirements of Art. I, &#167; 2, of the United States Constitution, as those requirements are defined in Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 84 S.Ct. 526, 11 L.Ed.2d 481.

It concluded that such a variation from average, without a suitable explanation, 'violates constitutional requirements.' 273 F.Supp. 984, at 989. The court noted that there have been 'substantial' population changes in these districts since 1960, and that complete accuracy in redistricting must await the results of the 1970 census, but reasoned that a suitable compromise would be to require redistricting immediately, premised on the best population figures now available.

Sims, supra, 377 U.S. at 578, 84 S.Ct. at 1390; Swann v. Adams, supra, 385 U.S. at 445, 87 S.Ct. 569, may be crucial to the validity of districting statutes, then surely the Court should endeavor to define what such circumstances are, and to indicate how they are relevant. Instead, the Court more and more often disposes of reapportionment cases summarily, see e. g., Toombs v. Fortson, supra; Duddleston v. Grills, 385 U.S. 455, 87 S.Ct. 611, 17 L.Ed.2d 508; Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 385 U.S. 450, 87 S.Ct. 613, 17 L.Ed.2d 511; Lucas v. Rhodes, 389 U.S. 212, 88 S.Ct. 416, 19 L.Ed.2d 423; and when the Court does issue an opinion, it is content simply to recite that such circumstances may be relevant without undertaking any elucidation. See, e. g., Swann v. Adams, supra. All this has the effect of leaving the state legislatures,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the lower courts, and even Congress<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> without meaningful guidance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the confusion created by the Court's reticence is compounded, in cases in which it is held that a districting statute does not satisfy constitutional requirements, by uncertainty as to the appropriate next step. See, e.g., Lucas v. Rhodes, supra. The District Court here noted that the Court's cases provided '[l]ittle guidance or help,' but concluded, nonetheless, that immediate redistricting should be ordered, based on the best available population figures. It thought that this expedient was in the pattern set by Swann v. Adams, 383 U.S. 210, 86 S.Ct. 767, 15 L.Ed.2d 707.  <i>Swann</i>, however, was merely a brief <i>per curiam</i> opinion, which did not purport to establish any general rule on appropriate remedies. As the elections of 1968 approach, it seems to me that the time has come for this Court to provide clearer guidance to the lower courts on the proper remedy in reapportionment cases. More particularly, some indication should be given as to what part, if any, 1960 census figures are to play, alone or in combination with later, albeit incomplete or unverified, population figures.
