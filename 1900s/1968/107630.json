The remaining contention of the State is that the specific orders directing desegregation of prisons and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*334</span> jails make no allowance for the necessities of prison security and discipline, but we do not so read the \"Order, Judgment and Decree\" of the District Court, which when read as a whole we find unexceptionable.</p>\n<p>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p>MR.
