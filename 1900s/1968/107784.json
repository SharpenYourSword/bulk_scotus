FPC v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., 386 U.S., 237, 87 S.Ct. 1003, 18 L.Ed.2d 18 (1967). Over the objections of the Commission, the Court of Appeals held that the issue had been sufficiently raised by United in its petition for rehearing before the Commission in accordance with &#167; 19 of the Natural Gas Act, 52 Stat. 831, as amended, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 717r, and that the Cities Service formula required that consolidated return tax savings coming to United be first allocated to United's nonjurisdictional income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitions for certiorari are granted and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s\" id=\"fn-s-s_ref\">**</a> Although we acquiesce in the Court of Appeals' construction of United's petition for rehearing filed with the Commission, the issue on remand was not in proper posture for final determination by the Court of Appeals and should have been remanded to the Commission for further consideration. It is true that the Commission in its opinion had remarked that 'United is largely a regulated company, and we shall designate it as such for the purpose of these computations.' United Gas Pipe Line Co., 31 F.P.C. 1180, 1190 (1964). But the Commission made no effort to justify this characterization of United in terms of the findings, the fundamentals of the Cities Service formula, or the applicable law. This may have been because the adversary proceedings were primarily concerned with the validity of the formula itself and never focused precisely on the question of intra-company revenue and cost allocation. Whatever the reason, there was 'no indication of the basis on which the Commission exercised its expert discretion,' no articulation of 'any rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.' Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 167, 168, 83 S.Ct. 239, 245, 246, 9 L.Ed.2d 207 (1962).

United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. FPC, 388 F.2d 385, 391&#8212;392 (C.A.5th Cir. 1968) (footnote omitted.) These questions should have had adequate attention from the Commission in the first instance before being subjected to judicial review.
