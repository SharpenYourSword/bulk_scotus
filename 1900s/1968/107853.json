Specific reference was made to the criminal sanctions imposed by both &#167; 1084 and &#167; 1952, the two sections which form the basis of petitioner's outstanding convictions. See 390 U.S., AT 44, 88 S.Ct. 697.

The Government's proof disclosed that petitioner, a professional bookmaker, instructed his clients to call a number at a New York City hotel and ask for a fictitious name. The hotel operator would inform the prospective bettor that his party was not in; the bettor would thereupon give the operator a code name previously agreed upon between the bettor and petitioner.

The Government's theory of prosecution was that petitioner caused the out-of-state bettors to use telephone facilities to place their wagers. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2(b). The Government thus had to convince the jury that petitioner was the causative factor prompting the calls,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> proof not required for the third and fourth counts. Petitioner placed his defense upon the argument that it was unlikely that he, a lowly bookie, caused his customers, men of substantial means, to make the telephone calls. It is at least arguable that the jury, faced with overwhelming evidence of petitioner's guilt of the registration and tax charges, allowed this fact to influence their deliverations concerning the interstate gambling offenses. Furthermore, this risk was compounded by the fact that the trial judge told the jury that, although petitioner was charged with four distinct offenses, these offenses were 'interrelated violations of federal law.' Simply, the Government was able to show via a prosecution for offenses which this Court has held constitutionally invalid that petitioner had violated the law; this demonstration may well have induced the jury to conclude the petitioner was guilty of the other charges as well.
