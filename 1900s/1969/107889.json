He flagged down a police car and, after an interruption by the police to warn him that he need not speak, that his speech might be used against him, and that he had a right to contact an attorney, was taken to the station house where he poured out a confession.

It was very early established that the Court will not decide federal constitutional issues raised here for the first time on review of state court decisions. In <i>Crowell</i> v. <i>Randell,</i> 10 Pet. 368 (1836), Justice Story reviewed the earlier cases commencing with <i>Owings</i> v. <i>Norwood's Lessee,</i> 5 Cranch 344 (1809), and came to the conclusion that the Judiciary Act of 1789, c. 20, \u00a7 25, 1 Stat. 85, vested this Court with no jurisdiction unless a federal question was raised and decided in the state court below. \"If both of these do not appear on the record, the appellate jurisdiction fails.\" 10 Pet. 368, 391. The Court has consistently refused to decide federal constitutional issues raised here for the first time on review of state court decisions both before the <i>Crowell</i> opinion, <i>Miller</i> v. <i>Nicholls,</i> 4 Wheat. 311, 315 (1819), and since, <i>e. g., </i><i>Safeway Stores, Inc.</i> v. <i>Oklahoma Retail Grocers Assn., Inc.,</i> 360 U.
