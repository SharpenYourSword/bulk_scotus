The only evidence against petitioner was obtained by the telephone company's action in tapping his telephone line or was the product of information gained from that tap. The company became suspicious that petitioner was using a 'blue box' to avoid payment for long-distance telephone calls. A 'blue box' is an electronic signaling device which can be used to bypass the equipment which automatically records tolls on direct-dialed long-distance calls. An electronic device&#8212;which did not record the content of any conversations&#8212;confirmed the presence on the line of the 2,600-cycle tone characteristic of the operation of a 'blue box.'
