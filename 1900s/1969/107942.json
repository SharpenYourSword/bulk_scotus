Petitioner's duties were to move, weigh, and load freight cars spotted by respondent on Cargill's siding track. He was working on the top of the third of a string of six cars when a coupler malfunctioned and caused the first two cars to break away. Petitioner dismounted and ran to the runaway cars. He climbed to the roof of one and was attempting to apply its brake when he fell 12 to 14 feet to a cement apron between the tracks and suffered severe injuries. He brought this action in tort in the Iowa District Court of Linn County. The only claim submitted to the jury was that petitioner's injuries resulted from respondent's maintenance, in violation of &#167; 2, of a freight car with a defective coupler. Over petitioner's objection the jury was instructed in accordance with settled Iowa tort law that it was petitioner's burden 'to establish by a preponderance or the greater weight of the evidence * * * that (he) was free from contributory negligence,' defined as 'negligence on the part of a person injured * * * which contributed in any way or in any degree directly to the injury.' The jury returned a verdict for respondent railroad. The Supreme Court of Iowa affirmed, Iowa, 160 N.W.2d 838 (1968). We granted certiorari. 393 U.S. 1947, 89 S.Ct. 692, 21 L.Ed.2d 690 (1969).

In such actions, the injured employee is required to prove only the statutory violation and thus is relieved of the burden of proving negligence, O'Donnell v. Elgin, J. &amp; E.R.
