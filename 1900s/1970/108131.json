He also petitioned a Federal District Court for injunctive relief pursuant to \u00a7 10 (<i>l</i>) of the Act, which directs him to apply for such temporary relief \"pending the final adjudication of the Board with respect to such matter.\"<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Counsel for Sears appeared at the hearing before the District Court, but Sears did not seek to intervene formally. After hearing testimony the court declined to issue an injunction, believing that Sears was not likely to prevail before the Board on its unfair labor practice charge.<sup>[3]</sup> The Regional Director did not appeal the court's decision, but Sears sought to do so. 410 F. 2d 1148. The Court of Appeals dismissed Sears' appeal on the ground that under the Act only the Regional Director could appeal from the denial of a \u00a7 10 (<i>l</i>) injunction. Thereafter the Board issued its decision and order in the underlying unfair labor practice proceeding, finding that the respondent union had violated \u00a7 8 (b) (4) (B) of the Act, and ordering it to cease and desist from its unlawful conduct. 176 N. L. R. B. No. 120, 71 L. R. R. M. 1372 (1969).</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances the question whether Sears could appeal the District Court's denial of an injunction has now become moot. For even if the Court of Appeals was wrong in dismissing Sears' appeal, any relief that that court might have given would now have terminated. \" `To adjudicate a cause which no longer exists is a proceeding which this Court uniformly has declined to entertain.' \" <i>Oil Workers Union</i> v. <i>Missouri,</i> 361 U.

S. 103.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*658</span> Sears concedes that an injunction, had one issued, would terminate upon \"final\" Board resolution of the underlying unfair labor practice charge. But it argues that the Board's action cannot be considered final where, as here, one of the parties, in this case the respondent union, has sought review of the Board's order. In this situation, Sears maintains, the injunctive relief, if granted, would remain in effect until the Board's order with respect to the underlying unfair labor practice were either enforced or denied enforcement by the Court of Appeals. It is argued that because the Court of Appeals has not yet acted on the Board's order here, Sears may still be entitled to injunctive relief, and thus the question of whether it was entitled to appeal the denial of a \u00a7 10 (<i>l</i>) injunction remains a viable one.</p>\n<p>But neither the language, the legislative history, nor the policies of the Act support this construction. For by its terms \u00a7 10 (<i>l</i>) merely authorizes the issuance of an injunction \"pending the final adjudication <i>of the Board</i> with respect to [the] matter.\" (Emphasis added.) Once the Board has acted, it can itself seek injunctive relief from the Court of Appeals, pursuant to \u00a7 10 (e) of the Act, which empowers that court to grant \"such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper.\"<sup>[4]</sup> See <i>McLeod</i> v. <i>Business Machine Mechanics Conference Board,</i> 300 F. 2d 237, 241. The legislative history makes clear that the purpose of enacting \u00a7 10 (<i>l</i>) in 1947 was simply to supplement the pre-existing \u00a7 10 (e) power of the Board by authorizing injunctive relief prior to Board action.<sup>[5]</sup> It was thus relief prior to Board <span class=\"star-pagination\">*659</span> action that Congress was concerned with providing when it enacted \u00a7 10 (<i>l</i>), and any injunction issued pursuant to that section terminates when the Board resolves the underlying dispute.</p>\n<p>Where the Board ultimately finds no unfair labor practice, it would clearly be contrary to the policies of the Act to permit a district court injunction to remain in effect pending Court of Appeals review of the District Court's action.
