Mack, was a dentist whose license to practice was revoked by the Florida State Board of Dentistry, the petitioner herein. Dr. Mack sought judicial review of the revocation proceedings in the state courts where he urged, without success, 'that the procedure before the Dental Board was such that he was deprived of a fair and impartial trial.' Mack v. Pepper, 192 So.2d 66, 67 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1966), cert. denied, 201 So.2d 551 (Fla.1967). Mack did not seek certiorari in this Court, but instead commenced an action in federal district court seeking relief under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. He argued in the District Court that the proceedings before the State Board were unconstitutional, in that the board acted as both prosecutor and judge in his case and further in that the charges against him were not proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The District Court held for Mack on the former, although not the latter ground. Mack v. Florida State Board of Dentistry, 296 F.Supp. 1259 (SD Fla.1969). On appeal, the Court of Appeals rejected both grounds advanced by Mack, but nonetheless held in his favor, concluding that the procedure before the board amounted not to a fair and impartial hearing, but to 'an ungoverned confrontation' totally unlike 'anything which claims to be an administrative hearing as known to the jurisprudence of this County.'

It has also been urged that a federal court should ignore the usual rules of <i>res judicata</i> when a plaintiff, who was a defendant in state court proceedings and who was thus compelled initially to present his federal claims in a state court, seeks in a federal suit to vindicate a specially protected federal interest.
