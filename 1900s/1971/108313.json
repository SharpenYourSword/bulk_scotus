We had earlier refused to accept 'the ex parte determination' of the issues by the Department of Justice Kolod v. United States, 390 U.S. 136, 137, 88 S.Ct. 752, 19 L.Ed.2d 962, and in Alderman worked out the procedures whereby the District Court would determine whether the evidence obtained was 'the product of illegal surveillance.' 394 U.S., at 168, 89 S.Ct. 961. The questions in that case concerned the use of 'evidence originating in electronic surveillance violative of his own Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures.' <i>Id.</i>, at 176, 89 S.Ct., at 968. That is the question here and is obviously not controlled by administrative practice or the Omnibus Crime Act, both of which are subordinate to the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The procedure to be designed here is not relevant only to criminals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Electronic surveillance is today common and pervasive, as we know from reports filed pursuant to &#167; 2519(3) of the Act<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and from various Senate and House investigations, including the one just concluded by Senator Ervin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> These invasions of privacy apparently touch not only criminals but reputable people whose only offense is political, social, or ideological non-conformity.
