The order, inter alia, stayed a pending prosecution of the appellees under certain state obscenity laws and temporarily restrained further enforcement of the laws against the appellees. It was entered by the District Judge shortly after he had certified a request for designation of a three-judge court to hear the appellees' suit for permanent declaratory and injunctive relief. Under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2284(3), a single district judge has power to enter such an order in a case to be heard by a three-judge court, but the order can be entered only 'to prevent irreparable damage' and can 'remain in force only until the hearing and determination by the full court.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants argue that the order in this case contravenes principles set forth last Term in Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). They invoke this Court's jurisdiction on direct appeal from 'an interlocutory or permanent injunction' in any action 'required * * * to be heard and determined by a district court of three judges,' under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1253. Since, however, &#167; 1253 does not authorize a direct appeal to this Court from a &#167; 2284(3) order by a single district judge, we dismiss this appeal for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Long ago, this Court made clear that no direct appeal lies under &#167; 1253 to the Supreme Court from a temporary restraining order issued by a single judge, even though the order may amount to an 'interlocutory injunction' and may have been issued in an action required to be heard by a three-judge court.
