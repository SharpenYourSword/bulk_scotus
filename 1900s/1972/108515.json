On two occasions, a police officer visited the store and purchased four magazines and one paperback novel. While in the store the second time, the officer also 'looked at parts' of 12 additional magazines and 14 other paperback books which were on petitioner's shelves. Based upon a reading of the four magazines, portions of the book, and the officer's conclusory affidavit, a magistrate issued an <i>ex parte</i> search warrant authorizing the seizure of the publications the officer had earlier purchased or perused. The warrant was executed and 7, copies of 35 different titles were seized. Among the items seized were 19 copies of nine magazines not specified in the warrant and apparently not previously evaluated by a magistrate.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner was charged with the sale or distribution of obscene matter in violation of Cal.Penal Code &#167; 311.2.

On appeal, the Appellate Department of the Superior Court ordered the suppression of those items which had been seized without a prior adversary hearing on their obscenity <i>vel non</i> but affirmed the municipal court with regard to the materials which had been purchased. The State then appealed and the Court of Appeal reversed in part the judgment of the Appellate Department and vacated in part the judgment of the municipal court, thereby allowing the admission into evidence of all the items except the one which had been determined not to be obscene. 17 Cal.App.3d 865, 95 Cal.Rptr. 242.

Similarly, where the subsequent proceedings in state court would deny the federal right for the vindication of which review was sought, we have concluded that the case was final. See, <i>e.g.</i>, Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U.S. 213, 87 S.Ct. 988, 18 L.Ed.2d 1 (speedy trial); Harris v. Washington, 404 U.S. 55, 92 S.Ct. 183, 30 L.Ed.2d 212 (double jeopardy); Colombo v.

Langdeau,<i>supra</i>, 371 U.S., at 558, 83 S.Ct., at 522, we have found the policies underlying &#167; 1257 satisfied where the matter to be reviewed was entirely 'separate and independent' from those to be raised in the subsequent state proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Mills v. Alabama, 384 U.S. 214, 86 S.Ct. 1434, 16 L.Ed.2d 484, a case strikingly similar to the present one, we determined that the finality requirement had been met. There, the trial court had sustained a demurrer to the complaint, but the Supreme Court of Alabama reversed and remanded for trial. Mr. Justice Black, speaking for eight members of the Court, concluded that we had jurisdiction under &#167; 1257:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The State has moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that      the Alabama Supreme Court's judgment is not a 'final      judgment' and therefore not appealable under &#167; 1257. The      State argues that since the Alabama Supreme Court remanded the case to the      trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with its      opinion (which would include a trial), the Supreme Court's      judgment cannot be considered 'final.' This argument has a      surface plausibility, since it is true the judgment of the      State Supreme Court did not literally end the case. It did,      however, render a judgment binding upon the trial court that      it must convict Mills under this state statute if he wrote      and published the editorial. Mills concedes that he did, and      he therefore has no defense in the Alabama trial court. Thus      if the case goes back to the trial court, the trial, so far      as this record shows, would be no more than a few formal      gestures leading inexorably towards a conviction, and then      another appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court for it formally      to repeat its rejection of Mills' constitutional contentions      whereupon the case could then once more wind its weary way      back to us as a judgment unquestionably final and appealable.      Such a roundabout process would not only be an inexcusable      delay of the benefits Congress intended to grant by providing      for appeal to this Court, but it would also result in a      completely unnecessary waste of time and energy in judicial      systems already troubled by delays due to congested dockets.      The language of &#167; 1257 as we construed it in Pope v. Atlantic      Coast Line R. Co., 345 U.S. 379, 381-383, 73 S.Ct. 749,      750-751, 97 L.Ed. 1094, does not require a result leading to      such consequences. See also Local No. 438 construction and      General Laborers' Union v. Curry, 371 U.S. 542, 548-551, 83      S.Ct. 531, 535-537, 9 L.Ed.2d 514; Richfield Oil Corp. v.

In light of appellant's concession that he has no      other defense to offer should the case go to trial, and      considering the importance of the First Amendment rights at      stake in this litigation, it would require regard for some      remote, theoretical interests of federalism to conclude that      this Court lacks jurisdiction because of the unlikely      possibility that a jury <i>might</i> disregard a trial judge's      instructions and acquit.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Indeed, even had appellant been unwilling to concede that he      has no defense&#8212;apart from the constitutional question&#8212;to the      charges against him, we would be warranted in reviewing this      case. That result follows <i>a fortiori</i> from our holdings that      where First Amendment rights are jeopardized by a state      prosecution, which, by its very nature, threatens to deter      others from exercising their First Amendment rights, a      federal court will take the extraordinary step of enjoining      the state prosecution.' 384 U.S., at 221, 86 S.Ct., at 1438.

The      State argues that since the Alabama Supreme Court remanded the case to the      trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with its      opinion (which would include a trial), the Supreme Court's      judgment cannot be considered 'final.' This argument has a      surface plausibility, since it is true the judgment of the      State Supreme Court did not literally end the case. It did,      however, render a judgment binding upon the trial court that      it must convict Mills under this state statute if he wrote      and published the editorial. Mills concedes that he did, and      he therefore has no defense in the Alabama trial court. Thus      if the case goes back to the trial court, the trial, so far      as this record shows, would be no more than a few formal      gestures leading inexorably towards a conviction, and then      another appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court for it formally      to repeat its rejection of Mills' constitutional contentions      whereupon the case could then once more wind its weary way      back to us as a judgment unquestionably final and appealable.      Such a roundabout process would not only be an inexcusable      delay of the benefits Congress intended to grant by providing      for appeal to this Court, but it would also result in a      completely unnecessary waste of time and energy in judicial      systems already troubled by delays due to congested dockets.

In light of appellant's concession that he has no      other defense to offer should the case go to trial, and      considering the importance of the First Amendment rights at      stake in this litigation, it would require regard for some      remote, theoretical interests of federalism to conclude that      this Court lacks jurisdiction because of the unlikely      possibility that a jury <i>might</i> disregard a trial judge's      instructions and acquit.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Indeed, even had appellant been unwilling to concede that he      has no defense&#8212;apart from the constitutional question&#8212;to the      charges against him, we would be warranted in reviewing this      case. That result follows <i>a fortiori</i> from our holdings that      where First Amendment rights are jeopardized by a state      prosecution, which, by its very nature, threatens to deter      others from exercising their First Amendment rights, a      federal court will take the extraordinary step of enjoining      the state prosecution.' 384 U.S., at 221, 86 S.Ct., at 1438.
