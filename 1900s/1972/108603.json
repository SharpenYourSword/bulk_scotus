Stat. \u00a7 944.21 (1) (a) (1969). He was sentenced to consecutive one-year terms in the Green Bay Reformatory and fined $1,000 on each of two counts. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin upheld his conviction against the contention that he had been deprived of freedom of the press in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. 51 Wis. 2d 668, 188 N. W. 2d 467.</p>\n<p>Petitioner was the publisher of an underground newspaper called Kaleidoscope. In an issue published in May 1968, that newspaper carried a story entitled \"The One Hundred Thousand Dollar Photos\" on an interior page. The story itself was an account of the arrest of one of Kaleidoscope's photographers on a charge of possession <span class=\"star-pagination\">*230</span> of obscene material. Two relatively small pictures, showing a nude man and nude woman embracing in a sitting position, accompanied the article and were described in the article as \"similar\" to those seized from the photographer. The article said that the photographer, while waiting in the district attorney's office, had heard that bail might be set at $100,000. The article went on to say that bail had in fact been set originally at $100, then raised to $250, and that later the photographer had been released on his own recognizance. The article purported to detail police tactics that were described as an effort to \"harass\" Kaleidoscope and its staff.</p>\n<p><i>Roth</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 354 U.

Material may be considered obscene when \"to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest.\" 354 U. S., at 489. In enunciating this test, the Court in <i>Roth</i> quoted from <i>Thornhill</i> v. <i>Alabama,</i> 310 U. S. 88, 101-102:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The freedom of speech and of the press guaranteed by the Constitution embraces at the least the liberty to discuss publicly and truthfully <i>all matters of public concern</i> without previous restraint or fear of subsequent punishment. The exigencies of the colonial period and the efforts to secure freedom from oppressive administration developed a broadened conception of these liberties as adequate to supply the public need for <i>information and education with respect to the significant issues of the times.</i> . . .\" (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p>We do not think it can fairly be said, either considering the article as it appears or the record before the state <span class=\"star-pagination\">*231</span> court, that the article was a mere vehicle for the publication of the pictures. A quotation from Voltaire in the flyleaf of a book will not constitutionally redeem an otherwise obscene publication, but if these pictures were indeed similar to the one seized\u0097and we do not understand the State to contend differently\u0097they are relevant to the theme of the article. We find it unnecessary to consider whether the State could constitutionally prohibit the dissemination of the pictures by themselves, because in the context in which they appeared in the newspaper they were rationally related to an article that itself was clearly entitled to the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Thornhill</i> v. <i>Alabama, supra</i><i>.</i> The motion for leave to proceed <i>in forma pauperis</i> and the petition for writ of certiorari are granted. The conviction on count one must therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p>In its August 1968 issue, Kaleidoscope published a two-page spread consisting of 11 poems, one of which was entitled \"Sex Poem.\" The second count of petitioner's conviction was for the dissemination of the newspaper containing this poem. The poem is an undisguisedly frank, play-by-play account of the author's recollection of sexual intercourse. But, as the <i>Roth</i> Court emphasized, \"sex and obscenity are not synonymous.. . . The portrayal of sex, <i>e. g.,</i> in art, literature and scientific works, is not itself sufficient reason to deny material the constitutional protection of freedom of speech and press.\" 354 U.

While such earmarks are not inevitably a guarantee against a finding of obscenity, and while in this case many would conclude <span class=\"star-pagination\">*232</span> that the author's reach exceeded his grasp, this element must be considered in assessing whether or not the \"dominant\" theme of the material appeals to prurient interest. While \"contemporary community standards,\" <i>Roth</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 354 U.
