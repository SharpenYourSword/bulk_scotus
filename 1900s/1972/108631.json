Is it possible that litigation would again have to proceed for an entire school year, or more, while indigent children are deprived of books, before the constitutionality of that deprivation is finally determined?</p>\n<p>These seem to me essential questions for the District Court to consider on remand in disposing of the issue of mootness.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Under New York law, local school districts are required to loan textbooks free to students in grades seven through 12. N. Y. Educ. Law § 701 (1971). No such provision is made for children in grades one through six; free textbooks are to be made available to children in those grades only upon the vote of the majority of the district's eligible voters to levy a tax to provide funds for the purchase of the textbooks, N. Y. Educ. Law § 703 (1971).</p>\n<p>[2]  The fee imposed was $7.50 per child.</p>\n<p>[3]  449 F. 2d 871, 873 (CA2 1971) (quoting with approval petitioners' allegations).</p>\n<p>[4]  Affidavit of Carl Jay Nathanson, App. 28.</p>\n<p>[5]  405 U. S. 916 (1972).</p>\n<p>[6]  These prior statements provide only rough guidance in this case, particularly since we deal here with an electoral process that is employed only on an irregular basis as new books are needed. Nevertheless, I think they are enlightening as to the appropriate inquiries for the District Court to make on remand.</p>\n<p>[7]  Nor should the District Court overlook the fact that this is a class action brought by petitioners \"on their own behalf and on behalf of their children and all other persons similarly aggrieved.\" Even if the case is now moot as to these particular petitioners, there may be other members of the class who remain aggrieved and thus the action may remain a viable one, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Cypress</i> v. <i>Newport News General &amp; Nonsectarian Hospital Assn.,</i> 375 F. 2d 648, 657-658 (CA4 1967); <i>Gatling</i> v. <i>Butler,</i> 52 F. R. D. 389, 394-395 (Conn. 1971). Cf. <i>Brockington</i> v. <i>Rhodes,</i> 396 U. S. 41, 43 (1969).</p>\n\n</div>", "id": 108631, "judges": "Per Curiam", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/108631/", "sha1": "59d351b5670215888e2853d570d554322eb6a235", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": "1972-011", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T10:11:39"}
