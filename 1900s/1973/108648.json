Iowa, 406 U.S. 117, 127, 92 S.Ct. 1379, 31 L.Ed.2d 733 (1972), has submitted a proposed Decree. Nebraska accepts it but Iowa filed five Exceptions, to which Nebraska replied. Upon consideration of the Exceptions in light of our opinion and the Report of the Special Master, Iowa's Exceptions II and III are overruled and Exceptions I, IV, and V are sustained insofar as paragraphs 11 and 12 of the Proposed Decree are revised in the following Decree, the entry of which is directed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">It is ordered, adjudged, and decreed that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

By 1943 the shifts of the Missouri River channel had been so numerous and intricate, both in its natural state and as a result of the work of the Corps of Engineers, that it was practically impossible to locate the original boundary line between the states.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.

Sections 2 and 3 are not to be construed as relating only to areas formed before July 12, 1943 that can be proved by clear, satisfactory, and convincing evidence to have been on the Nebraska side of the <i>original</i> boundary before the Compact fixed the permanent boundary. Such a construction would require the claimant who proves title 'good in Nebraska' also to shoulder the burden of proving the location of the <i>original</i> boundary before 1943, as well as proving that the lands were on the Nebraska side of that boundary which would be placing a burden upon the land owner which the states themselves refused to undertake in 1943 and agreed would not be necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6.
