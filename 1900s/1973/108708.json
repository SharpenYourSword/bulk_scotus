The trial judge in the case had issued orders barring the litigants and their lawyers from giving certain information to the press. When the Manson trial was ended, the trial judge summoned Farr and asked him what the sources of his information were. Farr acknowledged that he had received the news story from two of the six attorneys of record in the Manson case and some of it from another individual who was subject to the order concerning publicity but who was not an attorney. Farr refused to disclose the names and was committed to prison for civil contempt. He obtained no relief in the state courts<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and then brought federal habeas corpus which the District Court denied and, pending his appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, he has applied to me for bail or release on personal recognizance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the three cases decided in Branzburg v.

Branzburg, however, involved refusal of a reporter to testify before a grand jury and reveal the sources of his news stories. The federal rule is that just as the power of Congress to commit a recalcitrant witness for civil contempt ends with the adjournment of that Congress, Anderson v. Dunn, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85326\"><a href=\"/opinion/85326/anderson-v-dunn/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></a></span>, 231, 5 L.Ed. 242, so does the power of the grand jury end when the grand jury's term expires.

The Court of Appeal assertedly did not reach the issue as to whether Farr was covered by the section, holding instead that to construe the statute as granting immunity to Farr, in the face of the facts 'would be to countenance an unconstitutional interference by the legislative branch with an inherent and vital power of the court to control its own proceedings.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is argued, in return, that the remedy of criminal contempt against those subject to the trial court's publicity order is now out of reach because of the running of the statute of limitations on criminal contempt<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and therefore that the present civil contempt proceedings against Farr serve no legitimate state interest. I have received a response from respondent which says that this is 'purely a matter of state concern'&#8212;that 'there is no statute of limitations' in California for civil contempts.

The only question is whether the issue presented is a substantial one. Our Branzburg decision plainly does not cover it. Our denial of certiorari imparts no implication or inference concerning the Court's view of the merits, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter made clear in Maryland v. Baltimore Radio Show, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104765\"><a href=\"/opinion/104765/state-of-maryland-v-baltimore-radio-show-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></a></span>, 919, 70 S.Ct. 252, 255, 94 L.Ed. 562.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question, so far as I can tell, is not covered by any of our prior decisions. The case is a recurring one where the interests of a fair trial sometimes collide with the requirements of a free press. A fair trial requires that a jury be insulated from the barrage of prejudicial news stories that is sometimes laid down on the courtroom. It is said that in the present case the Manson jury was sequestered and so not subject to the kind of influence we condemned in Sheppard v. Maxwell.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue is not free from doubt.
