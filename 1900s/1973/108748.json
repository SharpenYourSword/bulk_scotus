In my dissent in <i>Zemel</i>, I enumerated several national interests which might support a restriction on the right to travel; none of those interests exist here. To the contrary, the national interest embodied in the First Amendment right to freedom of speech and information would be furthered by such a visit.

They are part of the world spectrum; and if we are to know them and understand them, we must mingle with them. . . .' (Zemel v. Rusk, <i>supra</i>, at 25, 85 S.Ct. 1271.) Keeping alive intellectual intercourse between seemingly opposing groups has always been important and is even more important in view of the bridges of communication long destroyed between this country and North Vietnam which are now being restored.
