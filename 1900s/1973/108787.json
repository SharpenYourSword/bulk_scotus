Since such organizations are formed to promote lawful      objectives which their members share as common interests by      virtue of their religious or ethnic identities, their      confining of membership to persons who bear the same      religious or ethnic identity is a rational classification. It      thus lacks the arbitrariness by which discrimination becomes      invidious and which is outlawed by the 'equal protection of      the laws' clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the      Constitution of the United States when it is the result of      State action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The exception as here recognized by the State of Maine is,      therefore, consistent with the federal Fourteenth Amendment.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webster's New International Dictionary tells us that 'ethnic' means: 'Relating to community of physical and mental traits in races, or designating groups of races of mankind discriminated on the basis of common customs and characters.'

Nor if a law should be      passed excluding all naturalized Celtic Irishmen, would there      be any doubt of its inconsistency with the spirit of the      Amendment.
