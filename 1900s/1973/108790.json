There is no question that the trial judge, in accepting the plea, complied with the mandate of Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274, that the record disclose that the plea was entered voluntarily and understandingly.

In short, we have recognized a 'right not to plead guilty.' United States v. Jackson, 390 U.S. 570, 581, 88 S.Ct. 1209, 20 L.Ed.2d 138. It is because of the waiver of these rights and that a guilty plea is itself a conviction that a guilty plea 'demands the utmost solicitude.' Boykin v.

I would hold, instead, that 'where the defendant presents a reason for vacating his plea and the government has not relied on the plea to its disadvantage, the plea may be vacated and the right to trial regained, at least where the motion to vacate is made prior to sentence and judgment.' Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 267-268, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (opinion of Marshall, J.); see Dukes v.

Moreover, due process of law requires that a person be convicted by proof beyond all reasonable doubt. In re Winship, <i>supra</i>. A guilty plea, if it is to be consistent with these principles, should not be allowed to stand if the defendant upon reflection or additional developments seeks <i>in good faith</i> to exercise his right to trial. I cannot accept a concept of irrevocable waiver of constitutional rights, at least where the government will not suffer substantial prejudice in restoring those rights. The criminal process is not a contest where the government's success is necessarily measured by the number of convictions it obtains, regardless of the methods used. A conviction after trial accords with due process only if it is based upon a full and fair presentation of all the relevant evidence which bears upon the guilt of the defendant. See, <i>e. g.</i>, Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87-88, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215. Similarly, a guilty plea should not be a trap for the unwary or unwilling. We should not countenance the 'easy way out' for the State merely because it has induced a guilty plea through a plea bargain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, of course, that the guilty plea plays an important role in the administration of the criminal law. See, <i>e. g.</i>, Santobello v. New York, <i>supra</i>, 404 U.S. at 260, 92 S.Ct. 495. But, the mere interest of the government in avoiding a full-blown trial cannot outweigh the interests of the defendant, when he asserts sufficient reasons, valid on their face, for withdrawing a guilty plea. See Dukes v. Warden, <i>supra</i>, 406 U.S. at 257-258, 92 S.Ct. 1551 (Stewart, J., concurring). Here the petitioner claimed that he pleaded guilty on the basis of a misunderstanding of applicable law. Also, he had reason to believe that a key prosecution witness would not testify as originally expected. Presumably, petitioner believed in good faith that he might present a successful defense to the charge of murder. In its opposition to the motion to withdraw the plea, the State did not assert any prejudice whatsoever if the plea were withdrawn. Only now, in its opposition to the petition for a writ of certiorari, does the State claim prejudice: '[I]n the truest sense, the Commonwealth does change its position because it requires a total rescheduling of cases with all the difficulties encountered by the calling of witnesses.' This conclusory allegation, absent a showing that the State has suffered inroads on its ability to maintain a prosecution, is not sufficient to override the vindication of petitioner's fundamental constitutional rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the opinion of Mr. Justice Marshall in Santobello v.

The Court, however, considered solely whether petitioner's guilty plea had been voluntary when entered. Mr. Justice Stewart concurred on the understanding that the case did not properly present an instance where the defendant had moved to withdraw his guilty plea before judgment. <i>Id.</i>, at 258, 92 S.Ct. 1551.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The indictment charged that 'on or about July 18, 1969, in said County, the said Harold Neely, feloniously, wilfully and of his malice aforethought did kill and murder Richard Earl Williams, all of which is against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.'</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The rule to show cause also alleged '[t]hat your petitioner is of the opinion that the Act of March 15, 1911, P.L. 20, Section 1 (19 P.S. &#167; 711) prohibits cross-examination by the Commonwealth of a Defendant as to his prior conviction for impeachment purposes unless the Defendant himself has placed his good character and reputation in issue.' That Act provides in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>'Hereafter any person charged with any crime, and called as a witness in his own behalf, shall not be asked, and, if asked, shall not be required to answer, any question tending to show that he has committed, or been charged with, or been convicted of any offense other than the one wherewith he shall then be charged, or tending to show that he has been of bad character or reputation; unless,&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n        <p>'One.
