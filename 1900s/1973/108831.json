The House Report No. 91-907, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., at 50, explains the reason for the change:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Because of the great increase in the number of serious      felonies committed by juveniles and because of the      substantial difficulties in transferring juvenile offenders      charged with serious felonies to the jurisdiction of the      adult court under present law, provisions are made in this      subchapter for a better mechanism for separation of the      violent youthful offender and recidivist from the rest of the      juvenile community.' The 'substantial difficulties' are obviously the constitutional rights explicated in <i>Kent</i> and in <i>Gault</i>. The 'better mechanism' is the use of the short cut employed, <i>viz</i>: the discretion of the prosecutor. Two rather large questions are presented and they seem to me to be substantial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>First</i>. A juvenile or 'child' is placed in a more protected position than an adult, not by the Constitution but by an Act of Congress. In that category he is theoretically subject to rehabilitative treatment. Can he on the the whim or caprice of a prosecutor be put in the class of the run-of-the-mill criminal defendants, without any hearing, without any chance to be heard, without an opportunity to rebut the evidence against him, without a chance of showing that he is being given an invidiously different treatment than others in his group? <i>Kent</i> and <i>Gault</i> suggest that those are very substantial constitutional questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Second</i>. The barricade behind which the prosecutor operates is that this, like other prosecutions, is committed to his informed discretion, which is beyond the reach of judicial intrusion.

But it is quite      different to vest such powers in a prosecuting attorney. A      judge and jury act under procedural rules carefully      prescribed to protect the liberty of the individual. Their      judgments and verdicts are reached after a public trial in      which a defendant has the right to be represented by an      attorney. No such protections are thrown around decisions by      a prosecuting attorney. Substitution of the prosecutor's      caprice for the adjudicatory process is an action I am not willing to      attribute to Congress in the absence of clear command. Our      system of justice rests on the conception of impersonality in      the criminal law.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 701 <i>et seq.</i>, gives the courts power to review 'agency action' and to hold it unlawful, if found to be 'contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.' &#167; 706(2)(B).

Is      it because the tradition became settled before the courts      made the twentieth-century discovery that the courts can      interfere with executive action to protect against abuses but at the same time can      avoid taking over the executive function?

Throughout the governmental system, courts have found that      other administrative or executive functions are in need of a      judicial check, with a limited scope of review. <i>The reasons      for a judicial check of prosecutors' discretion are stronger      than for such a check of other administrative discretion that      is now traditionally reviewable</i>.
