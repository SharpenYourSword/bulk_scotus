In accordance with the Economic Stabilization Act, this agreement was submitted to the Pay Board for approval, but the Board authorized an increase of only 9.54%. Subsequently, employees of the construction companies, members of three different locals of the United Mine Workers went out on strike in support of their demand for a wage increase as provided by the agreement.

It also determined that the stoppages constituted a violation of Pay Board Reg. &#167; 201.17(c) which provides that it shall be a violation of Pay Board regulations to '[i]nduce, solicit, encourage, force, or require, or attempt to induce, solicit, encourage, force or require, any other person to pay or to receive any portion of a wage and salary increase not authorized by such regulations or Pay Board decision . . ..' The court concluded that respondents were persons 'suffering legal wrong' within the meaning of &#167; 210(a) of the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 and were thereby entitled to injunctive relief. As to petitioners' claim that the Norris-LaGuardia Act barred injunctive relief against a union work stoppage in an action brought by an employer,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> the court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'In light of the importance of the Economic Stabilization      Program to economic welfare of the United States, the      Norris-LaGuardia Act must be interpreted to accommodate the      overriding Congressional intent expressed in the Economic      Stabilization Act.
