The jurisdictional statement asserts that the 10.62% overrepresentation exists in District No. 20 and that it was sought to be justified by the State on the grounds that the population of Mountain Home Air Force Base, located in the District, had increased by 2,000 since the 1970 census, that an irrigation project would cause further population growth in the District and that detaching certain areas from a particular county was undesirable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant asserts, in conclusory manner, that 'the population growth at Mountain Home Air Force Base is disputed' and that 'the anticipated growth in population was not projected with a high degree of accuracy.' The District Court, however, accepted the justification, specifically referring to increases in population as being among the justifications offered for various population deviations. 342 F.Supp. 288, 289 (1972). In any event, I find no basis in the jurisdictional statement for our disagreeing with the District Court or with the legislature. If there had been a 2,000 increase in population since 1972 the legislature was quite right in taking it into account, and the alleged deviation disappears.

Appellant complains that there should have been more effort to determine whether each individual student so excluded had in fact satisfied the residence requirements for voting. The District Court noted and accepted the justifying factor of the 'exclusion of the non-resident-college students, which were included in the 1970 census.' 342 F.Supp., at 289. There is no basis for upsetting the legislative estimate as to how many students at this particular college should be treated as nonresident, noncoting persons making up part of the 1970 census count.
