All parties agree that Texas law permits equitable intervention in a criminal proceeding if the criminal statute involved is unconstitutional, or otherwise void, and enforcement would result in irreparable injury to property rights. See State ex rel. Flowers v. Woodruff, 150 Tex.Cr.R. 255, 200 S.W.2d 178 (1947). Appellants challenged the constitutionality under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments of Art. 527, &#167; 9(h) of the Texas Penal Code, enacted as an aid to the enforcement of &#167; 3, which is Texas' basic criminal obscenity statute. Section 9(h) provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'In the event that a search warrant is issued and matter      alleged to be obscene is seized under the provisions of this      section, any person alleged to be in possession of the said      matter or claiming ownership of the matter at the time of its      possession or seizure may file a notice in writing with the      magistrate within 10 days of the date of the seizure alleging      that the matter is not obscene and the magistrate shall set a      hearing within one day after request therefor, or at such      time as the requesting party might agree, and at such hearing      evidence may be presented as to the obscenity of the matter      seized and at the conclusion of such additional hearing, the      magistrate shall make a further determination as to the      obscenity or nonobscenity of the matter.
