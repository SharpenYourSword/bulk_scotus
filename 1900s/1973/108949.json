The police followed reliable leads and located a house owned by Fitzpatrick in Syracuse. After attempting to get a response from inside, the police entered the house through a door which had been left ajar. As they came to a room on the second floor, petitioner called out from a closet in which he was hiding&#8212;'Don't shoot. I give up.' The officers seized and handcuffed him, and took him out into the hall. The police then questioned Fitzpatrick about the gun he had used, after advising him of his rights. He stated that it was in the closet where he had been found. The gun was retrieved from the closet and it was subsequently identified as the murder weapon at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a suppression hearing, the trial judge determined that petitioner had not been sufficiently apprised of his rights under Miranda v.

The trial court adopted what has been termed the rule of 'inevitable discovery,' stating 'proper police investigation would [in any event] have resulted in a search of that closet and [the gun's] discovery.' The New York Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the search was not inconsistent with Chimel v.

This limitation lends substance to petitioner's claim that this search, of a closet in a room, while an arrestee is handcuffed in a hall in the presence of police, cannot be justified.
