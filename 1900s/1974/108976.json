Supp. 1101) declining to intervene in a pending state civil proceeding and holding that such intervention was barred by our decision in <i>Younger</i> v. <i>Harris,</i> 401 U. S. 37. The state proceeding, brought against appellants by the Solicitor General of Fulton County, Georgia, sought an injunction against the operation of appellant Speight's bookstore, and confiscation and destruction of all merchandise on the store's premises, on the grounds that the store was being used for the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*334</span> \"advertising, storage, sale, and exhibition for sale of materials obscene within the meaning of Section 26-2101 of the Criminal Code of Georgia.\" The basis for the State's action was \u00a7 26-2103 of the Code under which the use of any premises for the violation of \u00a7 26-2101 constitutes a \"public nuisance,\" thereby triggering the application of state statutory provisions for the abatement of public nuisances, c. 72-2 of the Code of Georgia. The case is here on appeal. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1253, 2101 (b).

E. 2d 153 (1974). In <i>Sanders</i> the State had brought an action to enjoin the operation of a bookstore on the ground that certain publications sold by the store were obscene under \u00a7 26-2101. The supreme court held that this application of \u00a7 26-2103 \"represents an unconstitutional prior restraint when construed and applied to authorize the permanent closure of the book store as a public nuisance upon a finding that a single publication, obscene under the standards of Code Ann. \u00a7 26-2101 (b), was sold on its premises.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 611, 203 S. E. 2d, at 155. As we understand the Georgia court's decision, the operation of a bookstore could not be enjoined merely because some of its merchandise had been judicially determined to be obscene.
