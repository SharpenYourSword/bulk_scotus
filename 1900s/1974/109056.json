Because it was anticipated that the State would respect the declaratory judgment, the court declined to issue an injunction against the enforcement of the statute. The State of Florida appeals from the declaratory judgment invalidating the statute. The appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Title 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1253, under which this appeal is sought to be taken, does not authorize an appeal from the grant or denial of declaratory relief alone. Gunn v.
