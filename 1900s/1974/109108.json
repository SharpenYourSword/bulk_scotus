As permitted by Supreme Court Rule 21(1), which provides that the record in a case need not be certified to this Court, the petitioners did not certify the allegedly obscene materials involved in this case. It is plain, therefore, that the Court, which has not requested the certification of those materials, has failed to discharge its admitted responsibility under <i>Jenkins</i> independently to review those materials under the second and third parts of the <i>Miller</i> obscenity test. Nor can it be assumed that the court below performed such a review, since that responsibility was not made clear until <i>Jenkins</i>.
