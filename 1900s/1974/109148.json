First, is the privilege against      compulsory self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth      Amendment and applicable to the States by reason of the      Fourteenth. Malloy v.

Third, is the right to confront one's accusers. Pointer      v. Texas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107014\"><a href=\"/opinion/107014/pointer-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span>, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923.

To repeat what we said in <i>Boykin</i>, '[w]e cannot presume waiver . . . from a silent record.'  <i>Boykin</i> established that the State must demonstrate the defendant's knowing waiver of the three constitutional rights there enumerated. Two States have so interpreted <i>Boykin</i> as a constitutional minimum. People v.

Ohio seems to recognize the need to accommodate constitutional rights other than the three mentioned in <i>Boykin</i>, since its own supreme court has held that a trial judge must advise the defendant of his right to be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt before accepting a guilty plea. State v. Griffey, 35 Ohio St.2d 101, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></span> (1973).
