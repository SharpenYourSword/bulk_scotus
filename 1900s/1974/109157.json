Following a trial before a municipal judge, petitioner was convicted and sentenced to 100 days in jail and fined $500. Under Nebraska law, trial by jury is unavailable in a prosecution in municipal court for violation of a city ordinance.

Wilson, 127 U.S. 540, 555, 8 S.Ct. 1301, 32 L.Ed. 223 (1888), which held that a conspiracy offense did not belong in the 'petty' class. 'Petty offenses' were to be defined as those punishable by summary proceedings at common law prior to the adoption of the Constitution. The exclusion of petty offense prosecutions from the jury trial guarantee was repeated in several later cases. Natal v. Louisiana, 139 U.S. 621, 11 S.Ct. 636, 35 L.Ed.2d 288 (1891), involved a Fourteenth Amendment challenge to a Louisiana ordinance regulating the location of private marketplaces. Prosecution for violation was before a magistrate only and was punishable by a $25 fine or imprisonment for 30 days. In holding that the absence of jury trial did not vitiate conviction under the ordinance, the Court repeated the <i>Callan</i> dicta, but the decision came more than 70 years before we held the federal right to jury trial applicable in state proceedings, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 194, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968). In Schick v. United States, 195 U.S. 65, 24 S.Ct. 826, 49 L.Ed. 99 (1904), the petty offense exclusion was again repeated, but the holding of that case was that the defendant's waiver of jury trial in the District Court did not invalidate his conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not until District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U.S. 617, 57 S.Ct. 660, 81 L.Ed. 843 (1937), did the Court squarely rule that certain prosecutions are outside the constitutional guarantee. That case involved a prosecution in the District of Columbia for violation of a statute making it a crime, punishable by a fine of $300 or less, or imprisonment of 90 days or less, to sell second-hand goods without a license. In holding that trial by jury was not required, the Court expanded the definition of 'petty offenses' to embrace all those for which the authorized punishment failed to meet a requisite standard of severity. The degree of severity required to invoke the constitutional right was to be ascertained 'by objective standards such as may be observed in the laws and practices of the community taken as a guage of its social and ethical judgments.' <i>Id.</i>, at 628, 57 S.Ct. 660. In the years since <i>Clawans</i>, the Court has struggled to achieve greater precision in drawing the line that separates 'petty' from 'serious' crimes. See Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 160-162, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491; Dyke v. Taylor Implement Mfg. Co., 391 U.S. 216, 88 S.Ct. 1472, 20 L.Ed.2d 538; Frank v.

The Court's latest expression in this quest for certainty came last Term in Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, 418 U.S. 506, 94 S.Ct. 2687, 41 L.Ed.2d 912 (1974). There it was said that 'our decisions have established a fixed dividing line between petty and serious offenses: those crimes carrying more than six months sentence are serious crimes and those carrying less are petty crimes.' What apparently began in <i>Callan</i> as a narrow exception to the jury trial guarantee based upon the nature of the offense<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> has become a rigid rule based upon the maximum authorized punishment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the judgment were mine to make, I would entertain considerable doubt that petitioner's offense can be described as 'petty.'

A literal reading of the 'fixed dividing line' stated in <i>Codispoti</i> would place petitioner's offense in the 'serious' category, for it carries 'more than [a] six months sentence.' I recognize, however, that the Court has never expressly considered how the interaction of authorized imprisonment and fines affect the dividing line, although it has adverted to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1, defining as 'petty' a crime in which both six months' imprisonment and a $500 fine are authorized.
