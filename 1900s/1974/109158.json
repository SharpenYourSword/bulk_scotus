Weinberger, 488 F.2d 606 (CA9 1973), en banc, cert. denied, 417 U.S. 913, 94 S.Ct. 2612, 41 L.ed.2d 217 (1974), held in this case that the decision of the Secretary of HEW on a request to reopen a previous denial on the merits of a claim for benefits is so far committed to agency discretion by the provisions of &#167; 205(h) of the Social Security Act, Title 42 U.S.C. &#167; 405(h), that review of that decision is not available pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act. See Title 5 U.S.C. &#167; 701(a)(2). This holding is squarely in conflict with the holdings of three other Circuits in Cappadora v. Celebrezze, 356 F.2d 1 (CA2 1966); Davis v. Richardson, 460 F.2d 772 (CA3 1972); and Maddox v. Richardson, 464 F.2d 617 (CA6 1972). It is a prime function of this Court's certiorari jurisdiction to resolve precisely the kind of conflict here presented. Rule 19(1)(b), Rules of the Supreme Court. Perhaps the state of our docket will not permit us to resolve all disagreements between courts of appeals, or between federal and state courts, and perhaps we must tolerate the fact that in some instances enforcement of federal law in one area of the country differs from its enforcement in another.
