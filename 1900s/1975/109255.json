The system, which is established by a state statute,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> provides for countywide balloting for each of the four commission members, but requires that a member be elected from each of four residency districts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Appellees' sconstitutional claim was premised on the fact that the populations of the four districts vary widely, with the result that only one resident of the city of Selma can be a member of the commission, although the city contains about one-half of the county's population.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After extensive discovery, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama entered summary judgment for appellants, Dallas County and the members of the Dallas County Commission. The court relied heavily on our decision in Dusch v. Davis, 387 U.S. 112, 87 S.Ct. 1554, 18 L.Ed.2d 656 (1967), and concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'(T)he fundamental principle of representative government has      been fulfilled in that each County Commissioner's tenure      depends upon the vote of the qualified voters from the      countywide electorate. This fact alone requires each County      Commissioner to represent the county and not his own      residential area.' Jurisdictional Statement 15&#8212;16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit considered the case en banc and reversed, 8&#8212;6,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> 505 F.2d 879 (1974). The majority concluded that the unequal residency districts diluted the votes of city residents, and that the resulting discrimination was invidious. It distinguished Dusch on the basis of the particular facts of that case, which involved seven council membersselected from unequal residency boroughs, and four council members who could live anywhere in the city; according to the Court of Appeals, the effect was to assure that a majority of the 11-man council could not be assembled without the cooperation of either one 'representative' of the heavily populated boroughs or of one member of unrestricted residency. In the present case, on the other hand, the structure of the commission is such that the three commissioners who reside outside of Selma can control the commission, even though they 'represent' only a slight majority of the population.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The dissenters in the Court of Appeals thought that Dusch controlled. We agree, and reverse the Court of Appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dusch reaffirmed the principle enunciated in Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U.S. 433, 438, 85 S.Ct. 498, 501, 13 L.Ed.2d 401, 404 (1965), that when an official's 'tenure depends upon the countywide electorate he must be vigilant to serve the interests of all the people in the county, and not merely those of people in his home district.' Because the districts in the present plan are used 'merely as the basis of residence for candidates, not for voting or representation,' ibid.; Dusch v. Davis, supra, 387 U.S., at 115, 87 S.Ct., at 1556, each commissioner represents the citizens of the entire county and not merely those of the district in which he resides. We think that this teaching of Dusch and of Fortson v. Dorsey was all but ignored by the Court of Appeals, which chose instead to focus on a factual element of Dusch which was accorded absolutely no significance in the opinion in that case. Nor do we understand what significance could be attached to the presence of council members subject to no residence requirement, given the basic teaching that elected officials represent all of those who elect them, and not merely those who are their neighbors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court of Appeals was, of course, correct in recognizing that Dusch does not entirely insulate a plan such as this from constitutional attack. As that opinion noted: 'If a borough's resident on the council represented in fact only the borough, . . . different conclusions might follow.' 387 U.S., at 116, 87 S.Ct., at 1556. Similarly, in Dusch we approvingly quoted a portion of the District Court's opinion, including the following passage:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"As the plan becomes effective, if it then operates to      minimize or cancel out the voting strength of racial or      political elements of the voting population, it will be time      enough to consider whether the system still passes      constitutional muster.\" Id., at 117, 87 S.Ct., at 1556.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it clear, however, that Dusch contemplated that a successful attack raising such a constitutional question must be based on findings in a particular case that a plan in fact operates impermissibly to dilute the voting strength of an identifiable element of the voting population. Rather than basing its decision on a factual conclusion of this sort, the Court of Appeals relied on a theoretical presumption to reach its determination that residents of Selma were victims of invidious discrimination. That theoretical presumption is that elected officials will represent the districts in which they reside rather than the electorate which chooses them. But that is precisely the proposition rejected in Dusch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Act No. 328, &#167; 6, Acts of Alabama (Feb. 8, 1901) (as amended).

Nor is it possible in any other fashion to obtain a majority of the commission without the votes of either commissioners 'representing' a majority of the county's population or of the Judge of Probate whose residency is unrestricted.
