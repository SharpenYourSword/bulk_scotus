Petitioner is resident in the portion of the reservation in South Dakota, and respondent lives within that portion in North Dakota. This ligigation arose from an automobile accident occurring on the Reservation in North Dakota. Respondent's son was injured by a car driven by petitioner and died as a result. Respondent brought this wrongful death action based upon North Dakota law in the Federal District Court, invoking its jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a). When petitioner failed to respond, the North Dakota Unsatisfied Judgment Fund appeared and moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court, basing its decision upon Erie v.

The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe had not consented to the jurisdiction of the North Dakota state courts, as required for the exercise of state court jurisdiction in civil suits between Indians under 25 U.S.C. &#167; 1322(a), and the state courts would not have jurisdiction over respondent's suit although based upon North Dakota substantive law. See Gourneau v. Smith, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></span> (N.D.1973).

It concluded that there was no state policy involved in the absence of state-court jurisdiction over this type of litigation. The lack of jurisdiction arose from the <i>federal</i> requirement of consent by the Indians to such jurisdiction and the failure of the Tribe here to consent. The federal 'consent' statute, 25 U.S.C. &#167; 1322(a), was not intended to deprive Indians of state-created substantive rights, but rather had as its purpose an effort to prevent the States from interfering with Indian affairs.

See Hot Oil Service, Inc. v.

It distinguished those decisions on the ground that each involved an effort to avoid interference, under the principle of Williams v. Lee, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105807\"><a href=\"/opinion/105807/williams-v-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span>, 79 S.Ct. 269, 3 L.Ed.2d 251 1959), with tribal self-government. In this case, in contrast, the suit involved a dispute between two Indian litigants, and there were no 'interfering outsiders . . . trying to foist jurisdiction on the Indians.' 502 F.2d, at 29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below, however, misconstrued the role of the discussion of Williams v. Lee, <i>supra</i>, in the Ninth Circuit decisions. When those cases were decided, the question of whether the subject matter of the litigation was essential to tribal self-government was the key to whether state courts could exercise jurisdiction. See 358 U.S., at 223, 79 S.Ct. 269. Since its enactment in 1968, however, the 'consent' statute, 25 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1322(a) and 1326, provides an explicit procedure through which civil jurisdiction over Indians can be obtained by state courts. See McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108755\"><a href=\"/opinion/108755/mcclanahan-v-arizona-tax-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span>, 177-178, 93 S.Ct. 1257, 36 L.Ed.2d 129 (1973); Kennerly v.

It is conceded here that the subject matter of this suit, whether or not essential to tribal self-government, cannot be the basis for state-court jurisdiction. Therefore, the significant aspect of the Ninth Circuit decisions is their reliance upon Woods v. Interstate Realty Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104694\"><a href=\"/opinion/104694/woods-v-interstate-realty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span>, 69 S.Ct. 1235, 93 L.Ed. 1524 (1949).
