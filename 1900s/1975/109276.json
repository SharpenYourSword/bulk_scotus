Petitioner removed it to the District Court under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1441(a). The District Court denied respondent's motion for a remand under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1447(c). See 313 F.Supp. 915 (Del.1970). The District Court also denied respondent's motion for a certificate allowing an interlocutory appeal of the removal question under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(b). When the trial court denied its motion for a preliminary injunction, respondent appealed but did not raise the removal issue; and in affirming the denial of the preliminary injunction, the Court of Appeals did not discuss the question.
