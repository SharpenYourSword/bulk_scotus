The Ohio statutory scheme underlying these nuisance proceedings is outlined in Huffman v. Pursue, 420 U.S. 592, 95 S.Ct. 1200, 43 L.Ed.2d 482 (1975).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants filed suit in Federal District Court while the state proceedings were pending seeking injunctions against the state proceedings. The parties agreed not to go forward with the state court proceedings until the Federal District Court litigation was completed. The federal court refused to enjoin the state proceedings because it believed that Ohio could treat as a nuisance and close for a year a bookstore which sold some obscene materials, without running afoul of the constitutional proscriptions against prior restraint of materials protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar issue was presented on the merits in <i>Huffman, supra</i>. However, the Court refused to pass on the merits, because it believed that the federal court was barred from intervening in the state proceedings.

But I think it clear that even if <i>Huffman</i> was correctly decided, see Brennan, J., dissenting, 420 U.S., at 613, 95 S.Ct., at 1212, it does not govern this case. Here, the prosecuting authorities expressly agreed to submit to federal court jurisdiction, and they do not in this Court argue that the District Court could not have enjoined the state proceedings even if it believed them unconstitutional. Thus, any reliance on the principles of Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), has been waived. See Sosna v.
