On March 18, 1969, petitioner refused to obey a court order to return to testify before the same grand jury in connection with the same investigation. On that date, petitioner was adjudicated in contempt of court under N. Y. Jud. Law \u00a7 750 (1968) for his failure to testify before the grand jury; and, on March 21, 1969, after declining an offer to purge his contempt, petitioner was sentenced to a flat 30-day term in civil jail. Petitioner served his sentence.</p>\n<p>On June 10, 1970, petitioner was indicted for his refusal to answer questions before the grand jury on November 7, 1968. After asserting unsuccessfully that this indictment should be dismissed under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, petitioner pleaded guilty to the indictment and was sentenced on his plea.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> Petitioner appealed, claiming that the Double Jeopardy Clause precluded the State from haling him into court on the charge to which he had pleaded guilty.<sup>[1]</sup> The New York Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, declining to address the double jeopardy claim on the merits. It held, relying, <i>inter alia,</i> on <i>Tollett</i> v. <i>Henderson,</i> 411 U.

In light of the flat 30-day sentence imposed, the earlier contempt adjudication was a criminal conviction, <i>People</i> v. <i>Colombo,</i> 31 N. Y. 2d 947, 293 N. E. 2d 247 (1972), on remand from <i>Colombo</i> v. <i>New York,</i> 405 U.

If they did so hold, the New York Court of Appeals might be correct. However, in <i>Tollett</i> we emphasized that waiver was not the basic ingredient of this line of cases, 411 U. S., at 266. The point of these cases is that a counseled plea of guilty is an admission of factual guilt so reliable that, where voluntary and intelligent, it <i>quite validly</i> removes the issue of factual guilt from the case. In most cases, factual guilt is a sufficient basis for the State's imposition of punishment. A guilty plea, therefore, simply renders irrelevant those constitutional violations not logically inconsistent with the valid establishment of factual guilt and which do not stand in the way of conviction, if factual guilt is validly established. Here, however, the claim is that the State may not convict petitioner no matter how validly his factual guilt is established. The guilty plea, therefore, does not bar the claim.\n</p>\n<p>We do not hold that a double jeopardy claim may never be waived.
