Moreover, after the grant of certiorari, this Court was informed that the Civil Service Commission of the city of Chicago had revised its rules to provide for presuspension hearings in all nonemergency cases.<sup>[4]</sup> While this voluntary rule change was subject to rescission, counsel for the petitioner candidly advised the Court at oral argument that even if the petitioner should prevail, it was very doubtful that the Commission would revert to its former suspension procedures.</p>\n<p>In view of these developments, the writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvidently granted.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<p>MR.
