And the question of what is appropriate concerns, of course, the seriousness and dignity of the claim; yet beyond that it necessarily involves the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*797</span> availability of another forum where there is jurisdiction over the named parties, where the issues tendered may be litigated, and where appropriate relief may be had. We incline to a sparing use of our original jurisdiction so that our increasing duties with the appellate docket will not suffer.\"</blockquote>\n<p>And, nearly 40 years ago in <i>Massachusetts</i> v. <i>Missouri,</i> 308 U. S. 1, 18-19 (1939), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In the exercise of our original jurisdiction so as truly to fulfill the constitutional purpose we not only must look to the nature of the interest of the complaining Statethe essential quality of the right assertedbut we must also inquire whether recourse to that jurisdiction . . . is necessary for the State's protection. . . . We have observed that the broad statement that a court having jurisdiction must exercise it . . . is not universally true but has been qualified in certain cases where the federal courts may, in their discretion, properly withhold the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred upon them where there is no want of another suitable forum.\"</blockquote>\n<p>See also <i>Washington</i> v. <i>General Motors Corp.,</i> 406 U. S. 109, 113-114 (1972).</p>\n<p>In the circumstances of this case, we are persuaded that the pending state-court action provides an appropriate forum in which the <i>issues</i> tendered here may be litigated. If on appeal the New Mexico Supreme Court should hold the electrical energy tax unconstitutional, Arizona will have been vindicated. If, on the other hand, the tax is held to be constitutional, the issues raised now may be brought to this Court by way of direct appeal under 28 U. S. C. § 1257 (2).</p>\n<p>In denying the State of Arizona leave to file, we are <span class=\"star-pagination\">*798</span> not unmindful that the legal incidence of the electrical energy tax is upon the utilities. We also are not unmindful of Mr. Justice Harlan's cautionary advice in <i>Ohio</i> v. <i>Wyandotte Chemicals Corp.,</i> 401 U. S. 493, 497 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote>\"As our social system has grown more complex, the States have increasingly become enmeshed in a multitude of disputes with persons living outside their borders. Consider, for example, the frequency with which states and nonresidents clash over the application of state laws concerning taxes, motor vehicles, decedents' estates, business torts, government contracts, and so forth. It would, indeed, be anomalous were this Court to be held out as a potential principal forum for settling such controversies.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring.</p>\n<p>Unless the New Mexico electrical energy tax has some impact on the rates paid by consumers of electricity in Arizona, I do not believe those consumers have standing to challenge that tax. Arizona has failed to allege such impact. Accordingly, apart from its possible privity with the Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District, in my judgment the State of Arizona is not sufficiently affected by the New Mexico tax to justify its invocation of the \"original and exclusive jurisdiction\" of this Court conferred by 28 U. S. C. § 1251 (a) (1). Since the Salt River Project is able to litigate in another forum, I concur in the Court's disposition of the motion. However, except to the extent that they apply to Arizona's attempt to litigate on behalf of an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*799</span> entity which has access to another forum, I do not believe the comments which the Court has previously made about its nonexclusive original jurisdiction adequately support an order denying a State leave to file a complaint against another State.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  See N.
