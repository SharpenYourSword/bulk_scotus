The first count charged petitioner with selling a magazine primarily containing photographs of nude women. Genitals were exposed in some of the photographs. Count Two of the indictment charged petitioner with selling an unillustrated short novel containing descriptions of sexual acts.

Petitioner was adjudged guilty by the trial court and ultimately sentenced to six months of imprisonment and assessed a fine of $500. The judgment and sentence was affirmed by the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals. <i>Matheny v. State</i>, 55 Ala.App. 119, 313 So.2d 547 (1975).

It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, &#167; 374(4), as it incorporates the definition of obscene material in &#167; 374(3), is constitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face. For the reasons stated in my dissent in <i>Miller v.

In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the question of vagueness presented by petitioner merits plenary review. See <i>Heller v. New York</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></span>4, 495, 93 S.Ct. 2796, 37 L.Ed.2d 746 (1974) (Brennan, J., dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even accepting the Court's decision in <i>Miller v.

Under <i>Miller</i>, a work may not be obscene unless it 'depicts . . ., in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct.' 413 U.S., at 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607. While exhibition of the genitals may constitute sexual conduct, <i>id.</i>, at 25, 93 S.Ct. 2607, such exhibition must be patently offensive and lewd, <i>ibid</i>. '[N]udity alone is not enough to make material legally obscene under the <i>Miller</i> standards.' <i>Jenkins v. Georgia, supra</i>, 418 U.S. at 161, 94 S.Ct. 2750. Tested by those standards, the material involved in Count One, merely containing photographs of nude women, is clearly not obscene. This being so, a conviction of petitioner based only on Count One of the indictment cannot stand. Because of the general nature of the jury's verdict, in the light of the trial court's instruction to the jury, it is entirely possible that petitioner's conviction did indeed rest solely on the first count. In accordance with the Court's decision in <i>Bachellar v.
