He, however, was deemed not qualified since, at the time of his appointment, he owned no \"property assessed in East Baton Rouge Parish,\" as required by Louisiana Act 151 of 1969. The sole requirement is that he own property, whether real or personal, that is assessed in that parish. We sit to judge the constitutionality, not the wisdom, of this restriction. I am unable to agree that the Constitution, or prior cases from this Court, require today's declaration of unconstitutionality.</p>\n<p>This Court has regularly sustained the imposition of city or county residency requirements on municipal employees. <i>McCarthy</i> v. <i>Philadelphia Civil Serv.
