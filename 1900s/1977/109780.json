In the wake of this Court's decision in <i>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder</i>, 425 U.S. 185, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976), the courts of appeals have reached differing conclusions as to the degree of diligence appropriately required.  The court below held that because <i>Ernst &amp; Ernst</i> had imposed on defendants a standard not stricter than nonrecklessness, a plaintiff would not be barred from recovery unless he had been reckless.  551 F.2d 1005. Similarly, the Tenth and Seventh Circuits have held that, after <i>Ernst &amp; Ernst</i>, the contributory fault of the plaintiff would bar recovery only if it constituted \"gross conduct somewhat comparable to that of defendant.\"  <i>Holdsworth v. Strong</i>, 545 F.2d 687, 693 (C.A.10 1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 955, 97 S.Ct. 1600, 51 L.Ed.2d 805 (1977);  <i>Sundstrand Corp. v. Sun Chemical Corp.</i>, 553 F.2d 1033, 1048 (C.A.7), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 875, 98 S.Ct. 225, 54 L.Ed.2d 155 (1977).  Also, the Third Circuit now \"require[s] only that the plaintiff act reasonably\" and has shifted to the defendant the burden of proving the plaintiff's unreasonable conduct.  <i>Straub v. Vaisman &amp; Co.</i>, 540 F.2d 591, 598 (1976).  The Second Circuit, however, appears to adhere to the view that the plaintiff must demonstrate due diligence in discovering important information.  <i>Hirsch v. Du Pont</i>, 553 F.2d 750, 762-763 (1977);  accord, <i>NBI Mortgage Investment Corp. v. Chemical Bank</i>, 75 Civ. 3411 (S.D.N.Y.

Because securities litigation can be complex and expensive, it should be avoided to the maximum extent by early clarification of the ground rules.  This Court should thus promptly resolve the existing uncertainty as to the proper standard of care required of plaintiffs after <i>Ernst &amp; Ernst</i>.
