One can accept <i>Rizzo</i>, however, and yet view it as only one step in, rather than the end of, this Court's continuing effort to define the contours of &#167; 1983 suits against public officials who, with varying degrees of personal participation, have allowed the violation of citizens' rights by subordinate employees.  Certainly the lower courts have not found in <i>Rizzo</i> any unambiguous signal;  to the contrary, they have given the opinion varying interpretations that suggest the need for guidance from this Court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On its facts, moreover, this case is quite different from <i>Rizzo</i>.  There, the extent of the defendant officials' knowledge of their subordinates' unconstitutional actions was uncertain; plaintiffs apparently proceeded on the theory that the officials had a duty to act to correct a statistical pattern of abuse, regardless of their knowledge of the pattern.  See 423 U.S., at 376, 96 S.Ct. 598.  Here, petitioners' evidence established that complaints about illegal searches were made to state police officials.  The officials were, in the words of the Court of Appeals, \"insensitiv[e],\" \"obliviou[s],\" and \"indifferen[t]\" to these complaints.  554 F.2d, at 101.  A failure to act in the face of knowledge of subordinates' illegal actions is surely different from a failure to correct a statistical pattern of which one is not aware.  Cf. <i>Estelle v.
