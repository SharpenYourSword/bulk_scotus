The second clause establishes original jurisdiction over local causes of action without regard to diversity of citizenship.

The Court of Appeals apparently reasoned that any cause of action with diverse parties \"arising under the  . . .  laws  . . .  of the United States,\" since 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332, the diversity statute, is a law of the United States.

The short answer to the contention that diversity jurisdiction is merely a species of federal-question jurisdiction is that the Constitution itself distinguishes between these two types of jurisdictions.  \"The Constitution certainly contemplates these  . . .  as distinct classes of cases;  and if they are distinct, the grant of jurisdiction over one of them does not confer jurisdiction over  . . .  the other  . . ..

Co.</i> (<i>Hong Kong</i>) v. <i>Supreme Court of Guam,</i> 529 F. 2d 952, 955 n. 4 (1976). As in <i>Guam</i> v. <i>Olsen,</i> 431 U. S., at 197 n. 3, that holding is not at issue in this case.</p>\n<p>[4]  Indeed. we have never held that the Privileges and Immunities Clauses of Art. IV, § 2, cl. 1, and the Fourteenth Amendment restrict congressionalas opposed to stateaction.</p>\n<p>[5]  In fact, the legislative history of § 1421b (u) reveals that Congress' intent in extending the Privileges and Immunities Clauses to Guam was \"to limit the power of the territorial legislature rather than affect the jurisdiction of the district court. . . .\" 554 F. 2d, at 984 n. 17 (Sneed, J., dissenting). There is limited support in the legislative history for the view that Congress was also concerned with the ability of citizens \"to <i>appeal</i> in proper cases to the national courts . . . .\" S. Rep. No. 216, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 12 (1967) (letter of Feb. 19, 1967, from Assistant Secretary of Interior Harry R. Anderson to Senator Henry M. Jackson, Chairman of Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs) (emphasis added); see also H. R. Rep. No. 1521, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 14 (1968). It is doubtful that this one statement could serve as a sufficient basis for concluding that Congress impliedly amended its jurisdictional grant to the Guam District Court through the oblique mechanism of the Privileges and Immunities Clauses. But even if it could, the jurisdictional grant at issue here does not deny Guam litigants \"access to Art. III courts for appellate review of local-court decisions . . . .\" <i>Guam</i> v. <i>Olsen,</i> 431 U. S., at 204. Only the limitation on the District Court's original jurisdiction under the first clause of § 1424 (a), as quoted <i>supra,</i> is at issue here, and there is nothing in the legislative history of § 1421b (u) to suggest that Congress intended to alter the plain language of that jurisdictional grant.</p>\n\n</div>", "id": 109758, "judges": "Per Curiam", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/109758/", "sha1": "201f24944ac086b7e0da824ba08ced09cc8f4bd3", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": "1977-019", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T10:12:15"}
