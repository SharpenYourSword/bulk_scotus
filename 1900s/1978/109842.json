When the parent is emotionally distraught, crying and under the influence of drugs, not only is her advice likely to be less than \"competent,\" but the parent's demeanor may well have an adverse effect on the child's ability to make a knowing waiver of her own rights.  And to uphold a child's waiver on the ground that she received parental advice is surely questionable when the parent has two obvious conflicts of interest, one arising from the possibility that the parent herself is a suspect, and the other from the fact that she is \"advising\" the person accused of killing her spouse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulties inherent in a situation like that presented here have been recognized by lower courts and commentators.

When the parent is emotionally distraught, crying and under the influence of drugs, not only is her advice likely to be less than \"competent,\" but the parent's demeanor may well have an adverse effect on the child's ability to make a knowing waiver of her own rights.  And to uphold a child's waiver on the ground that she received parental advice is surely questionable when the parent has two obvious conflicts of interest, one arising from the possibility that the parent herself is a suspect, and the other from the fact that she is \"advising\" the person accused of killing her spouse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulties inherent in a situation like that presented here have been recognized by lower courts and commentators.
