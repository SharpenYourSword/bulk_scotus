Title IV anticipates that objections to the conduct of union elections be initiated by union members filing a complaint with the Secretary of Labor after exhausting union remedies.  Thereupon, however, it is the exclusive province of the Secretary to commence a civil action in federal district court.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 482(b).  <i>Trbovich</i> held that the union member who initiated the challenge might still intervene in the federal suit, \"so long as that intervention is limited to the claims of illegality presented by the Secretary's complaint.\"  <i>Trbovich, supra,</i> 404 U.S., at 537, 92 S.Ct. 630.  This conclusion represented a very careful balance between Title IV's commitment of enforcement authority to the Secretary's sole discre ion, and a recognition that the union member who originally raised the complaint might wish to see his claims pressed in some manner different from the Secretary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The opinion below threatens to upset that delicate compromise.  Intervention by union members in support of the Secretary's grounds of complaint was upheld in <i>Trbovich</i> only because it would make the union liable \"to relatively little additional burden,\" and would \"not subject the union to burdensome multiple litigation, nor will it compel the union to respond to a new and potentially groundless suit.\"  <i>Trbovich, supra,</i> 404 U.S., at 536, 92 S.Ct. 630.  Once attorneys' fees are assessable against a union on behalf of intervenors, however, the union has indeed become liable to an \"additional burden\" that could be quite costly.  And the adjudication of whether an intervenor has contributed significantly to the common benefit of all union members could well involve the \"burdensome multiple litigation\" that the restrictions on intervention imposed by <i>Trbovich</i> were intended to avoid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although not controlling, the Secretary of Labor's views should also be considered in any matter concerning the proper enforcement of the Act he is to administer.  It is significant, therefore, that the Secretary has in this case broken his silence on the attorneys' fees question for the first time.  It is the position of the Secretary that the awarding of attorneys' fees to intervenors \"significantly impedes the enforcement of Title IV.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other holding below, that intervention in such a case as this contributes to the \"common benefit\" of the group to be assessed the attorneys' fees, raises problems of its own.  A judge-made exception to the traditional American rule against awarding attorneys' fees, the \"common benefit\" theory is premised on a court's equity power to allocate a portion of a fund won for a class of persons through the efforts of a single person to compensate that single person.  See <i>Hall v. Cole,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108792\"><a href=\"/opinion/108792/hall-v-cole/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 n. 7, 93 S.Ct. 1943, 36 L.Ed.2d 702 (1973).  Subsequent elaboration extended the early theory to cases where no single class of persons was suing, <i>Sprague v. Ticonic National Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103201\"><a href=\"/opinion/103201/sprague-v-ticonic-nat-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span>, 59 S.Ct. 777, 83 L.Ed. 1184 (1939), and to cases involving a common benefit other than a tangible pool of assets.   <i>Mills v.

The Secretary has already investigated the case, and is already conducting the suit.  And the rationale permitting intervention was not to duplicate the efforts of the Secretary. Intervention was held permissible in <i>Trbovich</i> in order to protect a union member's interest, or his choice of how to represent that interest, precisely to the extent that the individual's interest <i>diverged</i> from the Secretary's.  The Secretary is the champion of the \"vital public interest in assuring free and democratic union elections that transcends the narrower interest of the complaining union member.\"  <i>Trbovich, supra,</i> 404 U.S. at 539, 92 S.Ct. 630, citing <i>Wirtz v.

Hence, the rationale that provides for the right to intervene in the first place substantially undercuts the intervenor's claim to be creating a significant <i>common</i> benefit not already provided by the Secretary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Third Circuit panel, in adopting a common-benefit theory correctly observed that our opinion in <i>Alyeska Pipeline Co. v.

However, the lower court's reasoning that a new election in a single district benefited the entire membership of the United Steelworkers of America in such an identifiable and proportionate way so as to justify burdening the entire membership with the intervenor's attorneys' fees represents logic squarely at issue with <i>Alyeska</i>'s construction of the common-benefit theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both holdings of the lower court appear to conflict with this Court's decisions.
