First,      because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful      and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of      ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what      is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly.  Vague laws      may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning.  Second,      if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be      prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who      apply them.  A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy      matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an      <i>ad hoc</i> and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of      arbitrary and discriminatory application.\"  (Footnotes      omitted.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See al o <i>Papachristou v.

Even conceding that a jury could properly infer from the shapes of the seized devices that some could be used for sexual stimulation, the fact that some people might use the devices for that purpose scarcely suffices to show that they are designed or marketed <i>primarily</i> for sexual stimulation.  As one commentator has noted, statutes couched in such terms of \"judgment and degree\" contain seeds of \"inherent discontrol\" over the law enforcement process and have been \"virtually [the] exclusive target of void-for-vagueness nullification.\"  Note, The Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine in the Supreme Court, 109 U.Pa.L.Rev. 67, 92-93 (1960).  Moreover, \"it is in this realm, where the equilibrium between the individual's claims of freedom and society's demands upon him is left to be struck <i>ad hoc</i> on the basis of a subjective evaluation,  . . .  that there exists the risk of continuing irregularity with which the vagueness cases have been concerned.\"  <i>Id.</i>, at 93.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, although vague statutes may be saved from constitutional infirmity if they require specific intent as an element of an offense, see <i>Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, supra</i>, 405 U.S. at 163, 92 S.Ct. 839, the constructive scienter requirement of &#167; 26-2101(a), at least as applied in appellant's trial, provides no reasonable assurance that persons will know or ought to know when they are likely to violate &#167; 26-2101(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record here is very clear:  Appellant was convicted solely on the basis of the <i>guesses</i> and <i>assumptions</i> of the single witness at trial&#8212;a policeman who had never used the devices, Reporter's Transcript, at 24, never seen them used, <i>id.</i>, at 25, and who knew of no one who used them for sexual stimulation, <i>id.</i>, at 26&#8212;that the seized devices were used primarily for the stimulation of human genitals.  See <i>id.</i>, at 22, 24.  In explaining how he had reached his guesses and assumptions notwithstanding a total lack of personal familiarity with the seized devices, that witness stated that he had seen, in the course of his investigations, \"newspapers that are printed and catalogs that are sent out to different people pertaining to these things.\"  <i>Id.</i>, at 32.  No catalogs were introduced into evidence and no evidence was given to show that the unidentified catalogs would likely have been sent to appellant.  Thus, how the proverbial \"reasonable man,\" or even a \"reasonable clerk in an adult book store,\" would have been put on notice of the <i>primary</i> use to which the seized devices would be put is simply not apparent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is therefore hard to imagine a more stark prima facie case of a \"vague law [which] impermissibly delegates basic  olicy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an <i>ad hoc</i> and subjective basis.\"  <i>Grayned v. City of Rockford, supra</i>, 408 U.S. at 108, 92 S.Ct. 2294.  In a society where the rule of law is paramount, it simply will not do to allow persons, however ignoble their trade&#8212;or perhaps because their trade is ignoble, cf. <i>Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, supra</i> &#8212;to be convicted of crimes solely because policemen and juries, encouraged by the State can conjure up scenes of sexual stimulation in which devices play a major role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set out above, I would set this case for argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice STEWART, dissenting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant stands convicted of the single crime of distributing obscene material in violation of Ga.Criminal Code &#167; 26-2101.  Cf. <i>Robinson v. State</i>, 143 Ga.App. 37, 237 S.E.2d 436, 438, vacated and remanded on other grounds, <i>post</i>.  The one-count indictment charged that he had sold both sexual devices, alleged to be obscene material as defined in &#167; 26-2101(c), and a magazine, alleged to be obscene under the definition in &#167; 26-2101(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the appellant does not claim that the definition of obscenity in subsection (b) is unconstitutional, he does ask this Court to examine the magazine in question and to determine that it is constitutionally protected as a matter of law.  I continue to believe that \"at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the state and federal governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents.\"  <i>Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton</i>, 413 U.S. 49, 113, 93 S.Ct. 2628, 37 L.Ed.2d 446 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).

So far as I know, no dictionary includes the human anus among the <i>genital</i> organs.  See also <i>Balthazar v. Superior Court</i>, 573 F.2d 698 (CA1 1978).

Vague laws      may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning.  Second,      if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be      prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who      apply them.

Even conceding that a jury could properly infer from the shapes of the seized devices that some could be used for sexual stimulation, the fact that some people might use the devices for that purpose scarcely suffices to show that they are designed or marketed <i>primarily</i> for sexual stimulation.  As one commentator has noted, statutes couched in such terms of \"judgment and degree\" contain seeds of \"inherent discontrol\" over the law enforcement process and have been \"virtually [the] exclusive target of void-for-vagueness nullification.\"  Note, The Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine in the Supreme Court, 109 U.Pa.L.Rev. 67, 92-93 (1960).  Moreover, \"it is in this realm, where the equilibrium between the individual's claims of freedom and society's demands upon him is left to be struck <i>ad hoc</i> on the basis of a subjective evaluation,  . . .  that there exists the risk of continuing irregularity with which the vagueness cases have been concerned.\"  <i>Id.</i>, at 93.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, although vague statutes may be saved from constitutional infirmity if they require specific intent as an element of an offense, see <i>Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, supra</i>, 405 U.S. at 163, 92 S.Ct. 839, the constructive scienter requirement of &#167; 26-2101(a), at least as applied in appellant's trial, provides no reasonable assurance that persons will know or ought to know when they are likely to violate &#167; 26-2101(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record here is very clear:  Appellant was convicted solely on the basis of the <i>guesses</i> and <i>assumptions</i> of the single witness at trial&#8212;a policeman who had never used the devices, Reporter's Transcript, at 24, never seen them used, <i>id.</i>, at 25, and who knew of no one who used them for sexual stimulation, <i>id.</i>, at 26&#8212;that the seized devices were used primarily for the stimulation of human genitals.  See <i>id.</i>, at 22, 24.  In explaining how he had reached his guesses and assumptions notwithstanding a total lack of personal familiarity with the seized devices, that witness stated that he had seen, in the course of his investigations, \"newspapers that are printed and catalogs that are sent out to different people pertaining to these things.\"  <i>Id.</i>, at 32.  No catalogs were introduced into evidence and no evidence was given to show that the unidentified catalogs would likely have been sent to appellant.  Thus, how the proverbial \"reasonable man,\" or even a \"reasonable clerk in an adult book store,\" would have been put on notice of the <i>primary</i> use to which the seized devices would be put is simply not apparent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is therefore hard to imagine a more stark prima facie case of a \"vague law [which] impermissibly delegates basic  olicy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an <i>ad hoc</i> and subjective basis.\"  <i>Grayned v. City of Rockford, supra</i>, 408 U.S. at 108, 92 S.Ct. 2294.  In a society where the rule of law is paramount, it simply will not do to allow persons, however ignoble their trade&#8212;or perhaps because their trade is ignoble, cf. <i>Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, supra</i> &#8212;to be convicted of crimes solely because policemen and juries, encouraged by the State can conjure up scenes of sexual stimulation in which devices play a major role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set out above, I would set this case for argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice STEWART, dissenting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant stands convicted of the single crime of distributing obscene material in violation of Ga.Criminal Code &#167; 26-2101.

The one-count indictment charged that he had sold both sexual devices, alleged to be obscene material as defined in &#167; 26-2101(c), and a magazine, alleged to be obscene under the definition in &#167; 26-2101(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the appellant does not claim that the definition of obscenity in subsection (b) is unconstitutional, he does ask this Court to examine the magazine in question and to determine that it is constitutionally protected as a matter of law.  I continue to believe that \"at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the state and federal governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents.\"  <i>Paris Adult Theatre I v.
