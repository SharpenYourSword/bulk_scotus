The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is internally divided.  Compare <i>Saunders v.

The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit expressly disavowed the test used in <i>Root</i>, adopted a new test requiring \"representation within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases,\" and applied this new standard to reverse the District Court.  Thus, the choice of standard was determinative of the outcome of this case. Moreover, the Court of Appeals focused on a relatively discrete problem in the conduct of the trial, so that analysis of the adequacy of representation will not require inquiry into all aspects of the preparation and handling of the case.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decisions of this Court recognize that the right to counsel is fundamental to a fair trial.  <i>Gideon v. Wainwright</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106545\"><a href=\"/opinion/106545/gideon-v-wainwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>,  3 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963);  <i>Powell v.

It also follows that we should attempt to eliminate disparities in the minimum quality of representation required to be provided to indigent defendants.  In refusing to review a case which so clearly frames an issue that has divided the courts of appeals, the Court shirks its central responsibility as the court of last resort, particularly its function in the administration of criminal justice under a Constitution such as ours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
