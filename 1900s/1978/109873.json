This demand, filed with the American Arbitration Association, relied upon the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &#167; 1 <i>et seq.</i>, (1976 ed.), and the arbitration clause of the 1973 agreement.  GAC also filed demands for arbitration against UNC in the federal arbitration proceedings involving Duke Power Co.

Finally, GAC requested the Santa Fe court to stay its own trial proceedings with respect to issues subject to these arbitration demands.

The right to pursue federal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*496</span> remedies and take advantage of federal procedures and defenses in federal actions may no more be restricted by a state court here than in <i>Donovan</i> [v. <i>Dallas,</i> 377 U. S. 408 (1964)]. Federal courts are fully capable of preventing their misuse for purposes of harassment.\" 434 U. S., at 18-19.</blockquote>\n<p>Footnote 11 specifically addressed arbitration proceedings which are the subject of Judge Felter's new stay order:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The injunction has also prevented GAC from asserting claims against UNC under the arbitration provision of the 1973 uranium supply agreement in the pending arbitration proceeding instituted against GAC and UNC by Commonwealth prior to its issuance, even though the District Court granted Commonwealth's demand for arbitration and the Seventh Circuit has affirmed. <i>Commonwealth Edison Co.</i> v. <i>Gulf Oil Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1367337\"><a href=\"/opinion/1367337/commonwealth-edison-co-v-gulf-oil-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">888</span></a></span> (ND Ill. 1975), aff'd, 541 F. 2d 1263 (1976). In addition, the Western District of North Carolina federal court has refused to stay arbitration between Duke and GAC in a proceeding also instituted prior to the injunction, despite GAC's contention that UNC was an indispensable party to any such arbitration proceeding which it was prevented from impleading by the injunction. The court acknowledged, however, that UNC would be a proper party to the proceeding. <i>General Atomic Co.</i> v. <i>Duke Power Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1739110\"><a href=\"/opinion/1739110/general-atomic-co-v-duke-power-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span> (1976).\"</blockquote>\n<p>In its order of December 16, 1977, the Santa Fe court has again done precisely what we held that it lacked the power to do: interfere with attempts by GAC to assert in federal forums what it views as its entitlement to arbitration.<sup>[1]</sup> Clearly, our <span class=\"star-pagination\">*497</span> prior opinion did not preclude the court from making findings concerning whether GAC had waived any right to arbitrate or whether such a right was contained in the relevant agreements. Nor did our prior decision prevent the Santa Fe court, on the basis of such findings, from declining to stay its own trial proceedings as requested by GAC pending arbitration in other forums. But, as demonstrated <i>supra,</i> we have held that the Santa Fe court is without power under the United States Constitution to interfere with efforts by GAC to obtain arbitration in federal forums on the ground that GAC is not entitled to arbitration or for any other reason whatsoever. GAC, as we previously held, has an absolute right to present its claims to federal forums.</p>\n<p>As was recently reaffirmed in <i>Vendo Co.</i> v. <i>Lektro-Vend Corp.,</i> 434 U. S. 425 (1978), if a lower court \"mistakes or misconstrues the decree of this Court, and does not give full effect to the mandate, its action may be controlled . . . by a writ of mandamus to execute the mandate of this Court.\" <i>In re Sanford Fork &amp; Tool Co.,</i> 160 U. S. 247, 255 (1895). A litigant who, like GAC, has obtained judgment in this Court after a lengthy process of litigation, involving several layers of courts, should not be required to go through that entire process again to obtain execution of the judgment of this Court. In light of the prior proceedings in this matter, it is inconceivable that upon remand from this Court the Santa Fe court was free to again impede GAC's attempt to assert its arbitration claims in federal forums. Because the Santa Fe court has refused or failed to comply with the judgment of this Court, petitioner's motion for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus is granted. Assuming as we do that the Santa Fe court will now conform to our previous judgment by promptly vacating or modifying its order of December 16, 1977, to the extent that it places any restriction whatsoever upon GAC's exercise <span class=\"star-pagination\">*498</span> of its right to litigate arbitration claims in federal forums, we do not at present issue a formal writ of mandamus.<sup>[2]</sup> See <i>Bucolo v. Adkins,</i> 424 U. S. 641 (1976); <i>Deen</i> v. <i>Hickman,</i> 358 U. S. 57 (1958).</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Although the court stated that its order staying the arbitration proceedings \"shall not in and of itself operate to preclude Defendant General Atomic Company from asserting its claimed federal rights in appropriate judicial proceedings,\" the only plausible reading of this provision in light of the stay order is that the court did not view the proceedings in question as \"appropriate.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  We do not read the December 27, 1977, order as restricting GAC from pursuing its arbitration claims in other forums. Consequently there is no occasion to disturb it.</p>\n\n</div>", "id": 109873, "judges": "Per Curiam", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/109873/", "sha1": "8b7113334360c274fbb05a96493f12a76d7dfb0e", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": "1977-095", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T10:12:18"}
