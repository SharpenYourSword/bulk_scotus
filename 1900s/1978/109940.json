The United States District Court agreed and issued an order prescribing measures designed to eradicate cruel and unusual punishment in the Alabama prison system. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed but modified some aspects of the order which it believed exceeded the limits of the appropriate exercise of the court's remedial powers. 559 F. 2d 283.</p>\n<p>Among the claims raised here by petitioners is that the issuance of a mandatory injunction against the State of Alabama and the Alabama Board of Corrections is unconstitutional because the Eleventh Amendment prohibits federal courts from entertaining suits by private parties against States and their agencies. The Court of Appeals did not address this contention, perhaps because it was of the view that in light of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*782</span> the numerous individual defendants in the case dismissal as to these two defendants would not affect the scope of the injunction. There can be no doubt, however, that suit against the State and its Board of Corrections is barred by the Eleventh Amendment, unless Alabama has consented to the filing of such a suit. <i>Edelman</i> v. <i>Jordan,</i> 415 U. S. 651 (1974); <i>Ford Motor Co.</i> v. <i>Department of Treasury,</i> 323 U. S. 459 (1945); <i>Worcester County Trust Co.</i> v. <i>Riley,</i> 302 U. S. 292 (1937). Respondents do not contend that Alabama has consented to this suit, and it appears that no consent could be given under Art. I, \u00a7 14, of the Alabama Constitution, which provides that \"the State of Alabama shall never be made a defendant in any court of law or equity.\" Moreover, the question of the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity is not merely academic. Alabama has an interest in being dismissed from this action in order to eliminate the danger of being held in contempt if it should fail to comply with the mandatory injunction.<sup>[1]</sup> Consequently, we grant the petition for certiorari limited to Question 2 presented by petitioners,<sup>[2]</sup> reverse the judgment in part, and remand the case to the Court of Appeals with instructions to order the dismissal of the State of Alabama and the Alabama Board of Corrections from this action.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<p>MR.

The Court held in <i>Edelman</i> v. <i>Jordan,</i> 415 U.
