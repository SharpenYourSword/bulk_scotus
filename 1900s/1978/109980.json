An alleged accomplice named Robinson was allowed to plead guilty to two lesser offenses in return for his testimony against the petitioners before a grand jury.  The prosecution intended to rely heavily on Robinson's testimony at the petitioners' trial.  Before the trial, however, Robinson stated that he would not testify. Although the court granted Robinson use immunity, he persisted in his refusal to testify.  Over the petitioners' objections, the trial judge then admitted the transcript of Robinson's grand jury testimony under Fed.Rule Evid. Rule 804(b)(5).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  After this transcript was read to the trial jury, Robinson did take the witness stand.

In grand jury proceedings, the ordinary rules of evidence do not apply.  Leading questions and multiple hearsay are permitted and common.  Grand jury investigations are not adversary proceedings.  No one is present to cross-examine the witnesses, to give the defendant's version of the story, or to expose weaknesses in the witnesses' testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only factor that generally makes grand jury testimony more trustworthy than other out-of-court statements is the fact that it is given under oath.  The witnesses speak under the threat of prosecution for material false statements.  But that usual indication of trustworthiness was missing here. Robinson recanted his grand jury testimony at the trial.  By disclaiming under oath his earlier sworn statements, he put himself in a position where one of his two sworn statements had to be false.  Without further proof, Robinson would appear to have violated federal law, and, after the petitioners' trial, the Government did, indeed, indict Robinson for violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1623.  The charges were dismissed only after he pleaded guilty to a contempt citation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Courts of Appeals are struggling with the problem of the admissibility of hearsay evidence not falling within one of the traditional exceptions to inadmissibility.

The Eighth Circuit, in a case in which the grand jury witness had not recanted his testimony, allowed the grand jury testimony to be admitted.  <i>United States v.
