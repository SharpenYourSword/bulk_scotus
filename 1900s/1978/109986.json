The Interstate Commerce Commission, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. &#167; 323, has adopted regulations that allow delivery without prior collection of freight charges but limit the credit that may be extended: Freight bills must be presented to the shipper and collected within seven days.  49 CFR &#167; 1322 (1977).  A \"shipper\" is defined as the person who undertakes to pay the tariff charges.  <i>Ibid.</i> The regulations are silent about what happens if the carrier fails to comply with the time limits established by them.  The question raised by this case is whether failure by the carrier to comply with the time limits prescribed by 49 CFR &#167; 1322 (1977) estops the carrier from collecting the freight charges from the shipper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Georgia Court of Appeals in this case held that it did, thereby joining the Seventh Circuit, which had reached a similar result in <i>Consolidated Freightways Corp. of Delaware v.

There the Court held that a shipper remains liable for the full legal tariff even though the carrier mistakenly billed him for less, rejecting an argument that estoppel prevented collection on the ground that \"[e]stoppel could not become the means of successfully avoiding the requirement of the act as to equal rates, in violation of the provisions of the statute.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 583.  The <i>Fink</i> case, although concerning Interstate Commerce Act provisions regulating railroads and not motor carriers, is directly analogous to this case, suggesting that the decision below may be at variance with our prior case law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the substantiality of the federal issue raised, I would grant certiorari and set this case for argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although I dissent from denial of certiorari, it must be acknowledged that this case is no more deserving of plenary consideration than many other cases in which certiorari has been denied so far this Term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the week of September 25, the Court met in Conference to deal with the petitions for certiorari, jurisdictional statements in appeals, petitions for rehearing, and miscellaneous motions that had accumulated and had been studied during the summer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a>  There was a total of 992 items on the Conference List, of which 865 were petitions for writs of certiorari and 59 were appeals.  As the Order Lists for this Term prior to today indicate, of these the Court has so far granted 24 petitions for certiorari, 23 paid and 1 unpaid, and has set for plenary consideration 6 appeals.  In addition, summary action on the merits was taken on 15 petitions for certiorari, 8 paid and 7 unpaid, and on 30 statements of jurisdiction.  Seven hundred and ninety-four petitions for certiorari were denied, 365 paid and 429 unpaid.  Twenty-one appeals were dismissed and denied.  There were thus 396 paid petitions for certiorari acted on and 437 unpaid, for a total of 833.  Fifty-seven of the 59 appeals were also disposed of.  For one reason or other, the remaining 32 petitions and 2 appeals have been held over for later action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 23 paid petitions granted amount to 5.81% of the 396 paid petitions acted upon.  Summary action was taken on an additional 2.02%, making a total of 7.83% of the paid petitions that were either granted or disposed of on the merits.  The single unpaid petition granted amounted to 0.23% of the unpaid petitions acted on.  Summary action was taken on an additional 1.60% of unpaid petitions, making a total of 1.83% of the unpaid petitions which were granted or on which summary action was taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our Rule 19 provides that one of the principal factors in determining whether certiorari should be granted is whether the decision below conflicts with another decision:  Is the federal law, statutory or constitutional, being interpreted and enforced differently in different sections of the country?  This has been an important criterion for the exercise of the Court's powers since most of the Court's jurisdiction was made discretionary in 1925.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When one examines the petitions for certiorari on the September 25 Conference List that have so far been denied, it is not difficult to find a good many cases in which the Court refused to review lower court decisions that conflicted with decisions of other federal or state appellate courts.

The remainder, falling short, I believe, of 20 percent, show      substantial grounds and are granted.

Indeed, if the certiorari docket resumes the remarkable growth that it exhibited prior to 1972, which it may well do when the output of the courts of appeals begins to reflect the many new judgeships created by the Omnibus Judgeship Act just passed by Congress, the percentage of petitions filed that can be reviewed here will inevitably decline even further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no doubt that those concerned with the coherence of the federal law must carefully consider the various alternatives available to assure that the appellate system has the capacity to function in the manner contemplated by the Constitution.

The notion that nine Justices of the Supreme      Court can deal as effectively and correctly with four times      as many docketed cases as were dealt with only four decades      ago may seem flattering to the incumbent Justices, but      Congress must become aware of the enormous change in the      burdens on the Justices in that short period of time.      Indeed, it can be documented that as far back as 40 years      ago, 10 years after the Judiciary Act of 1925, many of the      Justices were even then apprehensive about the capacity of      the Supreme Court to perform the functions performed in its      first 150 years.  The changes brought on in the 20th century      and the new social, political and economic developments have      surely not diminished the importance of the questions      presented to the Supreme Court and have vastly increased the      volume of important questions which can have an impact of      great significance on the country.\"  Report of the Commission      on Revision of the Federal Court Appellate System, Structure      and Internal Procedures:  Recommendations for Change,      reprinted in <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></span>, 398-399 (1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1975, the Commission on Revision of the Federal Court Appellate System issued its report, recommending</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"the creation of a new national court of appeals,      designed to increase the capacity of the federal judicial      system for definitive adjudication of issues of national law,      subject always to Supreme Court review.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 208.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That Commission found four significant consequences resulting from the inability of the federal judicial system to provide adequate capacity for the declaration of national law:  (a) unresolved intercircuit conflict;  (b) delay;  (c) a burden on the Supreme Court to hear cases arising from intercircuit conflict otherwise less worthy than many cases denied review;  and (d) resulting uncertainty in the law.  <i>Id.,</i> at 217-219.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission proposed a National Court of Appeals consisting of seven judges with reference jurisdiction and transfer jurisdiction.

Under the proposed transfer jurisdiction, any court of appeals could, in appropriate and specified circumstances, transfer any case to the National Court of Appeals for a nationally binding decision, subject to this Court's consideration.  <i>Id.,</i> at 238-247.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The recommendations of the Study Group on the Caseload of the Supreme Court, commonly called the \"Freund Committee,\" have been available to the Congress and the Bar since 1972.

Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress created only 13 federal district judgeships and six Justices of the Supreme Court. It did not provide for an intermediate appellate court staffed, as today, with United States circuit judges.  Supreme Court Justices were required to \"ride circuit\" and to sit with district judges to form circuit courts, sometimes reviewing district court appeals, sometimes sitting as trial judges.  Later these circuit-riding judges, acting as Supreme Court Justices, sat in review of the very cases in which they had participated on Circuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chief Justice John Jay and the Associate Justices urged relief and circuit courts of appeal were authorized in the Judiciary Act of 1801;  however, after the election of Thomas Jefferson, that statute was repealed the following year. Subsequently, Chief Justice Marshall unavailingly urged the creation of an intermediate tier of courts of appeals.  Thus, nearly a century passed before such courts were finally created in 1891;  they exist today as the United States Courts of Appeals for the 11 Circuits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my response of May 29, 1975, to the Commission, 67 F.R.D., at 396, I strongly urged that if an intermediate court was created it should not be a permanent tier of new judges at the outset. Rather, I suggested that Congress seriously consider the creation of a temporary court so that for five years, more or less, an experimental program could be carried out.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The experience could then serve as a valuable guide to the Congress, without the burden of the irreversible step of establishing a permanent intermediate court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Mr. Justice WHITE, too, favored an additional appellate court, \"at least on a trial basis.\"  He said in his letter to the Commission:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"I should also emphasize that the proposed new court      would not only permit the decision of a good many cases that      are not now being decided at all by this Court, but would also (1) permit plenary consideration in selected cases      which are within our compulsory appellate jurisdiction but      which are presently being summarily disposed of here;  (2)      permit this Court to decline full consideration of and refer      to the new court a substantial number of cases the issues in      which are not unusually important or complex but which are      now reviewed here because of existing conflicts among the      circuits or among the federal and state courts;  (3) enable      this Court, if it was so minded, to reduce the total number      of cases in which it now hears oral arguments and writes full      opinions, perhaps to the yearly average of approximately 100      that obtained for 15 years prior to the 1970 Term;  and (4)      present the opportunity for this Court to review some cases      that it would not now otherwise hear because of docket      pressures.\"  Report of the Commission on Revision of the      Federal Court Appellate System, 67 F.R.D., at 402.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After nearly nine years' delay, the 95th Congress recently created 117 additional district and 35 additional circuit judgeships&#8212;all of them long desperately needed, to meet rising caseloads at both levels.  This rise in caseload<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> is thought by many observers to result from multiple sources:  (a) the enactment of more than 50 statutes by Congress since 1969 increasing the jurisdiction of federal courts;  (b) the increasing tendency to bypass available state and municipal remedies in favor of assumed swifter remedies in federal courts;  (c) the increasing perceived need for courts to become \"problem solvers\" on great social and economic problems rather than the traditional resolvers of discrete, manageable disputes;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  (d) the default, perceived or real, of executive and legislative solutions;  and (e) the increasing complexity of much of the litigation arising from a modern society.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot assume any lessening in the expansion of federal jurisdiction or in congressional response to new demands.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  When the 152 newly created federal judgeships are filled and operational, decisions of those judges will likely generate a significant increase in cases subject to review on appeal or on certiorari in this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The additional judgeships may solve short-term problems, but the long-term problems of the Supreme Court analyzed by the Freund Committee and the Commission on Revision of the Federal Court Appellate System remain as they were a decade ago.

The Interstate Commerce Commission, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. &#167; 323, has adopted regulations that allow delivery without prior collection of freight charges but limit the credit that may be extended: Freight bills must be presented to the shipper and collected within seven days.  49 CFR &#167; 1322 (1977).  A \"shipper\" is defined as the person who undertakes to pay the tariff charges.  <i>Ibid.</i> The regulations are silent about what happens if the carrier fails to comply with the time limits established by them.  The question raised by this case is whether failure by the carrier to comply with the time limits prescribed by 49 CFR &#167; 1322 (1977) estops the carrier from collecting the freight charges from the shipper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Georgia Court of Appeals in this case held that it did, thereby joining the Seventh Circuit, which had reached a similar result in <i>Consolidated Freightways Corp. of Delaware v.

At least two jurisdictions share this view.  <i>AAA Trucking Corp. v. Spherex, Inc.,</i> 110 N.H. 472, 272 A.2d 594 (1970);  <i>East Texas Motor Freight Lines v.

Board of Wardens,</i> 12 How. 299, 319 (1852), commands the Court's immediate attention.  There is further justification for review in <i>Pittsburgh, C., C. &amp; St. L. R. Co. v. Fink,</i> 250 U.S. 577, 13 L.Ed. 996 (1919).  There the Court held that a shipper remains liable for the full legal tariff even though the carrier mistakenly billed him for less, rejecting an argument that estoppel prevented collection on the ground that \"[e]stoppel could not become the means of successfully avoiding the requirement of the act as to equal rates, in violation of the provisions of the statute.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 583.  The <i>Fink</i> case, although concerning Interstate Commerce Act provisions regulating railroads and not motor carriers, is directly analogous to this case, suggesting that the decision below may be at variance with our prior case law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the substantiality of the federal issue raised, I would grant certiorari and set this case for argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although I dissent from denial of certiorari, it must be acknowledged that this case is no more deserving of plenary consideration than many other cases in which certiorari has been denied so far this Term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the week of September 25, the Court met in Conference to deal with the petitions for certiorari, jurisdictional statements in appeals, petitions for rehearing, and miscellaneous motions that had accumulated and had been studied during the summer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a>  There was a total of 992 items on the Conference List, of which 865 were petitions for writs of certiorari and 59 were appeals.  As the Order Lists for this Term prior to today indicate, of these the Court has so far granted 24 petitions for certiorari, 23 paid and 1 unpaid, and has set for plenary consideration 6 appeals.  In addition, summary action on the merits was taken on 15 petitions for certiorari, 8 paid and 7 unpaid, and on 30 statements of jurisdiction.  Seven hundred and ninety-four petitions for certiorari were denied, 365 paid and 429 unpaid.  Twenty-one appeals were dismissed and denied.  There were thus 396 paid petitions for certiorari acted on and 437 unpaid, for a total of 833.  Fifty-seven of the 59 appeals were also disposed of.  For one reason or other, the remaining 32 petitions and 2 appeals have been held over for later action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 23 paid petitions granted amount to 5.81% of the 396 paid petitions acted upon.  Summary action was taken on an additional 2.02%, making a total of 7.83% of the paid petitions that were either granted or disposed of on the merits.  The single unpaid petition granted amounted to 0.23% of the unpaid petitions acted on.  Summary action was taken on an additional 1.60% of unpaid petitions, making a total of 1.83% of the unpaid petitions which were granted or on which summary action was taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our Rule 19 provides that one of the principal factors in determining whether certiorari should be granted is whether the decision below conflicts with another decision:  Is the federal law, statutory or constitutional, being interpreted and enforced differently in different sections of the country?  This has been an important criterion for the exercise of the Court's powers since most of the Court's jurisdiction was made discretionary in 1925.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When one examines the petitions for certiorari on the September 25 Conference List that have so far been denied, it is not difficult to find a good many cases in which the Court refused to review lower court decisions that conflicted with decisions of other federal or state appellate courts.

The remainder, falling short, I believe, of 20 percent, show      substantial grounds and are granted.

Indeed, if the certiorari docket resumes the remarkable growth that it exhibited prior to 1972, which it may well do when the output of the courts of appeals begins to reflect the many new judgeships created by the Omnibus Judgeship Act just passed by Congress, the percentage of petitions filed that can be reviewed here will inevitably decline even further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no doubt that those concerned with the coherence of the federal law must carefully consider the various alternatives available to assure that the appellate system has the capacity to function in the manner contemplated by the Constitution.

Indeed, it can be documented that as far back as 40 years      ago, 10 years after the Judiciary Act of 1925, many of the      Justices were even then apprehensive about the capacity of      the Supreme Court to perform the functions performed in its      first 150 years.  The changes brought on in the 20th century      and the new social, political and economic developments have      surely not diminished the importance of the questions      presented to the Supreme Court and have vastly increased the      volume of important questions which can have an impact of      great significance on the country.\"  Report of the Commission      on Revision of the Federal Court Appellate System, Structure      and Internal Procedures:  Recommendations for Change,      reprinted in 67 F.R.D. 195, 398-399 (1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1975, the Commission on Revision of the Federal Court Appellate System issued its report, recommending</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"the creation of a new national court of appeals,      designed to increase the capacity of the federal judicial      system for definitive adjudication of issues of national law,      subject always to Supreme Court review.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 208.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That Commission found four significant consequences resulting from the inability of the federal judicial system to provide adequate capacity for the declaration of national law:  (a) unresolved intercircuit conflict;  (b) delay;  (c) a burden on the Supreme Court to hear cases arising from intercircuit conflict otherwise less worthy than many cases denied review;  and (d) resulting uncertainty in the law.  <i>Id.,</i> at 217-219.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission proposed a National Court of Appeals consisting of seven judges with reference jurisdiction and transfer jurisdiction.

Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress created only 13 federal district judgeships and six Justices of the Supreme Court. It did not provide for an intermediate appellate court staffed, as today, with United States circuit judges.  Supreme Court Justices were required to \"ride circuit\" and to sit with district judges to form circuit courts, sometimes reviewing district court appeals, sometimes sitting as trial judges.

If the improvement in the expeditious dispensation of justice intended by the Congress and the President when they authorized 152 new federal judges is to be realized, these problems should be faced without waiting for a crisis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice BRENNAN.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems appropriate, in light of footnote 7 of the memorandum of THE CHIEF JUSTICE, to note my statement to the Commission, 67 F.R.D., at 400, that Mr. Justice BRENNAN \"remains completely unpersuaded, as he has repeatedly said, that there is any need for a new national court.\"  See also my article, The National Court of Appeals:  Another Dissent.  40 U.Chi.L.Rev. 473 (1973).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> The analysis following in the text pertains only to this Term's first Conference List.
