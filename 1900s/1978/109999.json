The question arises in this case because of applicant's challenge to the admission of evidence obtained from a wiretap placed in applicant's apartment over a period of approximately three months without prior judicial warrant.  As phrased in the application:  \"The court of appeals  . . .  will be asked to rule upon the government's claim of power to conduct lengthy warrantless surveillance of domestic premises, in light not only of the fourth amendment but of the express authorization of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2516(1)(a) for the use of warrants in espionage cases.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The uncertainty of the ultimate answer to this important constitutional question is not of itself, however, sufficient reason to continue applicant's bail.

Nevertheless, \"where the reasons for the action below clearly appear, a Circuit Justice has a nondelegable responsibility to make an independent determination of the merits of the application.\"  <i>Reynolds v.

The question for my \"independent determination\" is thus whether the evidence justified the courts below in reasonably believing that there is a risk of applicant's flight.

The evidence referred to by the Court of Appeals is that applicant maintained contact with the Vietnamese Ambassador in Paris;  that he has not established a permanent residence in this country;  and that, should applicant flee to Vietnam, the United States would have no means to procure his return.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  But if these considerations suggest opportunities for flight, they hardly establish any inclination on the part of applicant to flee.  And other evidence supports the inference that he is not so inclined.  Applicant faithfully complied with the terms of his pretrial bail and affirmed at sentencing his faith in his eventual vindication and his intention not to flee if released on bail.  He has resided continuously in this country since 1965, and has extensive ties in the community.  He has produced numerous affidavits attesting to his character and to his reliability as a bail risk.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  He has maintained a close relationship with his sister, a permanent resident of the United States since 1969.  The equity in his sister's Los Angeles home constitutes a substantial measure of the security for applicant's bail.  In addition, applicant's reply to the memorandum for the United States in opposition informs us that the \"American Friends Service Committee and the National Council of Churches have come forward with large sums which are now in the registry of the court in Alexandria.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I conclude, therefore that there was insufficient basis for revocation of applicant's bail following his conviction, and that his bail should be continued at $250,000 pending decision of his appeal by the Court of Appeals.
