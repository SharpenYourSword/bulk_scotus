The California Court of Appeal, which stayed the order of the Superior Court, observed that the doctrine of these cases \"reflects a refinement of earlier case law which should not and cannot be ignored.\"  The majority of the Supreme Court of California, however, in a special session held Wednesday, September 6, vacated the supersedeas or stay issued by the Court of Appeal and denied applicant's request for a stay of the order of the Superior Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were the decision of the Supreme Court of California premised on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, I would be inclined to agree with the conclusion of the California Court of Appeal that the remedial order entered by the Superior Court in response to earlier decisions of the Supreme Court of California was inconsistent with our decisions cited above.

Although the California Court of Appeal is of the view that this Court's cases would require a different result from that reached by the Supreme Court of California in <i>Crawford,</i> and although the order of the Supreme Court of California issued Wednesday was not accompanied by a written opinion, in the short time available to me to decide this matter I think the fairest construction is that the Supreme Court of California continues to be of the view which it announced in <i>Jackson</i> and adhered to in <i>Crawford.</i>  Quite apart from any issues as to finality, it is this conclusion which effectively disposes of applicant's suggestion that four Justices of this Court would vote to grant certiorari to review the judgment of the Supreme Court of California, which in effect overturned the order of the Court of Appeal and reinstated the order of the Superior Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applicant relies upon my action staying the judgment and order of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in <i>Columbus Board of Education v.
