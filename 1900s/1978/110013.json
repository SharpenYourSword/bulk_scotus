The District Court's order denied applicants' request for a permanent injunction to halt further construction in connection with the Warm Springs Dam-Lake Sonoma project on Dry and Warm Springs Creeks in Sonoma County, Cal. (the Dam).  Applicants also ask that pending disposition of their appeal I enjoin all further construction activity at the site, except work for the purpose of protecting the soil from effects of weathering and erosion.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Dam will be an earth-filled dam, holding back a reservoir of water, across Dry Creek, a major tributary of the Russian River in Sonoma County.  It is a multipurpose project designed to provide flood control, water supply, and recreation.  The Dam was first authorized in the Flood Control Act of 1962, Pub.L. 87-874, 76 Stat. 1173, 1192, and was under construction when the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 4321 <i>et seq</i>. (NEPA), became law.  An environmental impact statement was filed prior to the award of a contract for a major segment of the Dam and it is the adequacy of that statement under NEPA which has been the focus of this litigation.  When built, the Dam will sit atop the Dry Creek earthquake fault.  A second fault is about 11/2 miles away and the San Andreas fault is 18 miles distant.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applicants brought an action in the District Court on March 22, 1974, seeking a preliminary injunction to stay further construction activity with respect to the Dam.  During 14 days of hearings on the motion for a preliminary injunction, applicants raised questions about the integrity of the Dam should an earthquake occur and alleged poisoning of the water in the reservoir behind the Dam.  On May 23, 1974, the District Court found that the environmental impact statement fully complied with NEPA and denied applicants' motion for the injunction. Thereafter, the Ninth Circuit denied applicants' motion for an injunction pending appeal.  On June 17, 1974, Mr. Justice Douglas issued an order staying further disturbance of the soil in connection with the Dam, other than for research, investigation, planning, and design activity, pending decision of their appeal by the Court of Appeals.  <i>Warm Springs Dam Task Force v.

The Court of Appeals continued the existing stay in effect until further action by the District Court.  Although not ordered by the court, the Army Corps of Engineers prepared and widely circulated a supplement to the environmental impact statement covering the archaeological aspects of the Dam and the seismicity and water purity problems.

Oral argument on the appeal was heard on March 13, 1978. When decision of the appeal was not forthcoming, applicants renewed their request for a stay on May 8, 1978.
