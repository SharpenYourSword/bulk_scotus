Their convictions were affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on September 7, 1978, and their application to stay issuance of the mandate of the Court of Appeals pending determination by this Court of related petitions for certiorari pending before it was denied on November 16.  Meanwhile, this Court granted certiorari on October 16 in No. 78-139, <i>Puget Sound Gillnetters Assn. v. United States District Court and No. 78-119, Washington v.

There is no question, as the Government maintains in the response which I have requested, that a conviction for criminal contempt may be valid quite apart from the validity of the underlying injunction which was violated, and that the invalidity of an injunction may not ordinarily be raised as a defense in contempt proceedings for its violation.  <i>Walker v.</i> Birmingham, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107489\"><a href=\"/opinion/107489/walker-v-birmingham/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span>, 315-320, 87 S.Ct. 1824, 1829-1830, 18 L.Ed.2d 1210 (1967);  <i>United States v.

The District Court rejected this contention, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions for criminal contempt relying upon cases from this Court holding that in some circumstances citizens of a State who claim rights pursuant to state law may be deemed \"in privity\" with a State and be bound by an injunction or decree to which only the State was a party. <i>Tacoma v.

The information available to me as to related proceedings in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit may not be completely accurate, but I am advised that that court granted a stay at the request of Denne M. Harrington and Gary D. Rondeau, whose appeals from convictions for criminal contempt for violation of the same injunction were consolidated with those of applicants in the Court of Appeals and decided by that court in the same opinion.  While applicants did seek a stay from the Court of Appeals of its affirmance of their contempt convictions, it is not apparent from the information available to me that they did so after this Court granted certiorari in No. 78-139, or that they requested the stay pending disposition of a petition for certiorari in their own cases, rather than pending disposition of No. 78-139.  Our Rule 27 provides that applications for a stay here will not normally be entertained unless application for a stay has first been made to a judge of the court rendering the decision sought to be reviewed.  On the basis of the information before me, I cannot say that applicants have requested a stay from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit pending disposition by this Court of <i>their</i> petition for certiorari seeking to review the affirmance of their contempt convictions, though I cannot say with certainty that they have not.  Because of this uncertainty on my part, because of our grant of certiorari in No. 78-139, and because the Court of Appeals apparently has granted a stay with respect to Harrington and Rondeau, I think it the better exercise of my discretion to require applicants to apply to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for a stay pending this Court's disposition of their petition for certiorari.
