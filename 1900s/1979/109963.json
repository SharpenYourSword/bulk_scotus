S. C. \u00a7 136a, effects a taking for private use and without compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and that the Act is to that extent invalid. A three-judge court was convened under former 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2282 (1970 ed.) and proceeded to reject these contentions. Appellant seeks to appeal directly to this Court. Having examined the Act and the papers before us, however, we are convinced that whatever may be true with respect to data submitted after January 1, 1970, the FIFRA, as amended, does not at all address the issues of the conditions under which pre-1970 data may be used in considering another application. It neither authorizes, forbids, nor requires the existing agency practice with respect to pre-1970 data. As a legal matter, then, appellant's attack is on agency practice, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*321</span> not on the statute. The three-judge court was thus improperly convened, <i>William Jameson &amp; Co.</i> v. <i>Morgenthau,</i> 307 U. S. 171, 173-174 (1939), and this Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain a direct appeal from the judgment in such case. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1253; <i>Norton</i> v. <i>Mathews,</i> 427 U.

JUSTICE BLACKMUN, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I am of the view that the 1975 amendments to FIFRA specifically address the practices of the EPA and permit and ratify them. The constitutionality of the statute is therefore necessarily drawn into question in this lawsuit. See <i>Flast</i> v. <i>Cohen,</i> 392 U. S. 83, 88-91, and n. 3 (1968). I therefore conclude that the three-judge District Court was properly convened. On the merits, I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</div>",
