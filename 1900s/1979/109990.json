A month later, Fowler intervened as a petitioner.  After a hearing, the District Court held that petitioners' mandatory maximum life sentences were so \"grossly out of proportion to the severity of [their] crime[s]\" as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  436 F.Supp. 1153, 1164 (1977).

The precept that sanctions should be commensurate with the seriousness of a crime found expression in both the Magna Carta and the English Bill of Rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  And this Court has long recognized that the Eighth Amendment embodies a similar prohibition against disproportionate punishment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Weems v.

Although the sentence was excessive not merely in its length but in its conditions&#8212;15 years of hard labor in chains, with lifetime surveillance after release&#8212;the duration of the imprisonment and subsequent supervision plainly contributed to the Court's conclusion that \"[s]uch penalties for such offenses amaze those who  . . .  believe that  . . .  punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to offense.\"  <i>Id.</i>, at 366-367, 30 S.Ct. 544.  In so ruling, the Court quoted with approval the Massachusetts Supreme Court's observation that imprisonment \"for a long term of years might be so disproportionate to the offence as to constitute a cruel and unusual punishment.\"  <i>Id.</i>, at 368, 30 S.Ct. 544, quoting <i>McDonald v.

Thus, while recognizing that the power to prescribe punishments rests in the first instance with the legislature, we have not abdicated our constitutional function to draw a meaning from the Eighth Amendment consonant with \"the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\"  <i>Id.</i>, at 101, 78 S.Ct. 590.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most recently, in <i>Coker v.

Whether it did so in fact is, in my judgment, open to serious question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under <i>Coker</i>, the threshold inquiry concerns the character of the offense.  In assessing the severity of petitioners' crimes, the Court of Appeals made the following observations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The crime [drug abuse] spawns is well recognized.

We conclude that the legislature      could only properly judge the severity of the crime involved      by considering the well understood and undisputed operating      procedures of the dirty business involved and its disastrous      consequences.\"  576 F.2d, at 412 (footnote and citation      omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This analysis is problematic for several reasons. Petitioners were convicted of selling a single dose of cocaine and of possessing one ounce of a substance containing cocaine.  They were not, as the dissent pointed out, \"wholesalers, importers, dealers or distributors of that drug or of heroin.\"  <i>Id.</i>, at 423 (Oakes, J., dissenting).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Yet New York's 1973 statute precluded the judges who sentenced Carmona and Fowler from taking into account any gradations of culpability when imposing the maximum punishment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To rationalize petitioners' sentences by invoking all evils attendant on or attributable to widespread drug trafficking is simply not compatible with a fundamental premise of the criminal justice system, that individuals are accountable only for their own criminal acts.  Nor is it consistent with the proportionality principle implicit in the Eighth Amendment.  As <i>Coker</i> suggests, a crime that is sometimes accompanied by collateral offenses cannot constitutionally be punished as if it were always so linked.  That the rape in <i>Coker</i> occurred while the defendant was committing armed robbery did not alter the plurality's analysis for, \"[a]lthough [rape] may be accompanied by another crime, rape by definition does not include the death of, or even the serious injury to another person.\"  433 U.S., at 598, 97 S.Ct. 2861.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, none of the collateral crimes to which the Court of Appeals adverted carry as severe a punishment as those currently at issue.  In New York, the maximum prison term for first-degree robbery and burglary is 25 years, for first-degree assault it is 41/2 to 15 years, and for prostitution, 3 months.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  To justify a stringent penalty for an act on the assumption that the act may engender other crimes makes little sense when those other crimes carry less severe sanctions than the act itself.  See 576 F.2d, at 423 (Oakes, J., dissenting).  In sum, by focusing on the corrosive social impact of drug trafficking in general, rather than on petitioners' actual&#8212;and clearly marginal&#8212;involvement in that enterprise, the Court of Appeals substantially overstated the gravity of the instant charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When comparing petitioners' sentences with those prescribed for other crimes by New York, and for the same crime in other States, it is first necessary to clarify the precise nature of the penalty imposed.  Although the Court of Appeals professed to acknowledge that the \"major question on appeal is whether the mandatory maximum sentence of life imprisonment imposed on [petitioners] is unconstitutional,\" 576 F.2d, at 408, it declined to analyze the sentences in terms of their maximum potential. Rather, the court discounted petitioners' penalties by the \"probability of parole,\" <i>id.</i>, at 413, and considered the constitutionality of those lesser undefined sentences.  This approach is analytically unsatisfying and inconsistent with the position taken by other courts that have considered the constitutionality of maximum life sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under New York law, the determination to grant parole and absolute discharge from parole is committed to the discretion of the Parole Board.  Unless the parolee receives an absolute discharge, he remains in the legal custody of the State for the maximum term of his sentence and may be reincarcerated for violating any of the conditions which normally attach to the grant of parole.  N.Y. Exec. Law &#167; 259-i(2)(b) (McKinney Supp.1978). Since the standard governing absolute discharge from parole, whether such termination would serve the \"best interests of society,\" &#167; 259-j, affords nearly limitless discretion to the Parole Board, petitioners could not claim any realistic expectation of release from legal custody prior to the termination of their maximum sentences.  On similar reasoning, the New York Court of Appeals and the California Supreme Court have both evaluated Eighth Amendment claims by reference to the maximum terms the defendants might serve, notwithstanding the possibility of parole.  <i>People v. Broadie</i>, 37 N.Y.2d, at 110, 371 N.Y.S.2d, at 474, 332 N.E.2d, at 341;  <i>In</i> re Lynch, 8 Cal.3d 410, 415-418, 105 Cal.Rptr. 217, 220-222, 503 P.2d 921, 924-926 (1972) (en banc).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had the Court of Appeals evaluated petitioners' sentences in terms of their maximum potential, it might well have reached a different result.  In New York, the only other crimes with mandatory life sentences are first- and second-degree murder, first-degree arson (intentional damage to an inhabited building by explosion) and first-degree kidnaping (abduction if the victim dies or the purpose is extortion).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Among those crimes carrying a substantially lighter maximum penalty than the $20 sale and possession of an ounce of cocaine involved here are:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) first degree rape (sexual intercourse by force or      with a female physically helpless or less than 11 years old)      (6-25 years);</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) first degree manslaughter (homicide with intent to      cause serious physical injury) (6-25 years);</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) second degree kidnapping (abduction) (6-25 years);</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) second degree arson (intentional damage to an      inhabited building) (6-25 years); (5) first degree robbery or burglary (armed) (6-25 years);      and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(6) first degree assault (injury with intent to cause      disfigurement or serious physical injury) (41/2-15 years).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just as the plurality in <i>Coker</i> found it \"difficult to accept the notion  . . .  that the rapist  . . .  should be punished more heavily than the deliberate killer,\" 433 U.S., at 600, 97 S.Ct. 2861, so, too, I find it difficult to accept the concept that the sale or possession of a small amount of cocaine should be penalized more severely than manslaughter or forcible rape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Compared with the punishment for similar offenses in other jurisdictions, New York's drug law is unique in its severity.

Neither Fowler nor Carmona would have faced a mandatory      sentence of life imprisonment under the law of any other      state.  As for Carmona, in thirty-one states the <i>maximum</i>      penalty provided by law is less than the <i>minimum</i> sentence      which she is serving.\"  576 F.2d, at 424 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under federal drug laws, Carmona, if charged as a first offender with simple possession, could have received no more than one year of imprisonment and/or a $5,000 fine, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 844(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Fowler's sale of narcotics, as a first offense, would have been punishable by probation or incarceration for up to 15 years and/or a fine of up to $25,000, coupled with a mandatory special parole term of at least 3 years.  21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although acknowledging that the penalties under the 1973 New York law are harsher than those in any other jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals justified the disparity on the ground that New York City \"houses more than half of all the addicts in the entire United States.\"  576 F.2d, at 415.  There was no finding to that effect by the District Court.  Rather, the majority relied on <i>People v. Broadie</i>, 37 N.Y.2d, at 116, 371 N.Y.S.2d, at 479, 332 N.E.2d, at 345, which in turn drew upon an estimate in E. Brecher and the Editors of Consumer Reports, Licit and Illicit Drugs 72 (1972).  Current evidence, however, indicates that New York City has no more \"epidemic\" a drug problem than a number of other major metropolitan areas.  A study by the National Institute on Drug Abuse reveals that in 1973, the year the statute was passed, Los Angeles, Miami, Detroit, Phoenix, San Diego, and San Francisco all had more heroin addicts per capita than New York City.  Person, Retka, &amp; Woodward, A Method for Estimating Heroin Use Prevalence, NIDA Technical Paper 8 (1977).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even granting that New York has a greater concentration of drug abuse than other States, this does not of itself justify the punishments at issue here.

In support of that proposition, the court cited no findings by the District Court.

Petitioners were convicted of selling a single dose of cocaine and of possessing one ounce of a substance containing cocaine.  They were not, as the dissent pointed out, \"wholesalers, importers, dealers or distributors of that drug or of heroin.\"  <i>Id.</i>, at 423 (Oakes, J., dissenting).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Yet New York's 1973 statute precluded the judges who sentenced Carmona and Fowler from taking into account any gradations of culpability when imposing the maximum punishment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To rationalize petitioners' sentences by invoking all evils attendant on or attributable to widespread drug trafficking is simply not compatible with a fundamental premise of the criminal justice system, that individuals are accountable only for their own criminal acts.  Nor is it consistent with the proportionality principle implicit in the Eighth Amendment.  As <i>Coker</i> suggests, a crime that is sometimes accompanied by collateral offenses cannot constitutionally be punished as if it were always so linked.  That the rape in <i>Coker</i> occurred while the defendant was committing armed robbery did not alter the plurality's analysis for, \"[a]lthough [rape] may be accompanied by another crime, rape by definition does not include the death of, or even the serious injury to another person.\"  433 U.S., at 598, 97 S.Ct. 2861.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, none of the collateral crimes to which the Court of Appeals adverted carry as severe a punishment as those currently at issue.  In New York, the maximum prison term for first-degree robbery and burglary is 25 years, for first-degree assault it is 41/2 to 15 years, and for prostitution, 3 months.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  To justify a stringent penalty for an act on the assumption that the act may engender other crimes makes little sense when those other crimes carry less severe sanctions than the act itself.  See 576 F.2d, at 423 (Oakes, J., dissenting).  In sum, by focusing on the corrosive social impact of drug trafficking in general, rather than on petitioners' actual&#8212;and clearly marginal&#8212;involvement in that enterprise, the Court of Appeals substantially overstated the gravity of the instant charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When comparing petitioners' sentences with those prescribed for other crimes by New York, and for the same crime in other States, it is first necessary to clarify the precise nature of the penalty imposed.  Although the Court of Appeals professed to acknowledge that the \"major question on appeal is whether the mandatory maximum sentence of life imprisonment imposed on [petitioners] is unconstitutional,\" 576 F.2d, at 408, it declined to analyze the sentences in terms of their maximum potential. Rather, the court discounted petitioners' penalties by the \"probability of parole,\" <i>id.</i>, at 413, and considered the constitutionality of those lesser undefined sentences.  This approach is analytically unsatisfying and inconsistent with the position taken by other courts that have considered the constitutionality of maximum life sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under New York law, the determination to grant parole and absolute discharge from parole is committed to the discretion of the Parole Board.

Since the standard governing absolute discharge from parole, whether such termination would serve the \"best interests of society,\" &#167; 259-j, affords nearly limitless discretion to the Parole Board, petitioners could not claim any realistic expectation of release from legal custody prior to the termination of their maximum sentences.  On similar reasoning, the New York Court of Appeals and the California Supreme Court have both evaluated Eighth Amendment claims by reference to the maximum terms the defendants might serve, notwithstanding the possibility of parole.  <i>People v.

Neither Fowler nor Carmona would have faced a mandatory      sentence of life imprisonment under the law of any other      state.

There was no finding to that effect by the District Court.  Rather, the majority relied on <i>People v. Broadie</i>, 37 N.Y.2d, at 116, 371 N.Y.S.2d, at 479, 332 N.E.2d, at 345, which in turn drew upon an estimate in E. Brecher and the Editors of Consumer Reports, Licit and Illicit Drugs 72 (1972).  Current evidence, however, indicates that New York City has no more \"epidemic\" a drug problem than a number of other major metropolitan areas.  A study by the National Institute on Drug Abuse reveals that in 1973, the year the statute was passed, Los Angeles, Miami, Detroit, Phoenix, San Diego, and San Francisco all had more heroin addicts per capita than New York City.
