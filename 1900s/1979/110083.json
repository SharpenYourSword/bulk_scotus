Both petitioner and a separately indicted accomplice, Keith Givhan, retained the same counsel.  On November 8, 1976, the day before petitioner's trial, his attorney filed a motion to withdraw because of a conflict of interest.  Counsel did, however, express his willingness to continue representing Givhan, whose trial was scheduled for the following week.  After a hearing, the circuit court denied the motion and petitioner's case proceeded to trial.  A jury found petitioner guilty as charged and sentenced him to death.  The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed.  <i>Irving v.

Finally, plea negotiations with the local district and county attorneys had raised the possibility of a bargain in one case but not the other.  Under those circumstances, counsel averred that he could not, based on his \"reading of <i>Glasser</i> [<i>v.
