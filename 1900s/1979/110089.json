Moore was tried separately, was convicted of both crimes, and has been sentenced to death.  See <i>Moore v. State</i>, 240 Ga. 807, 243 S.E.2d 1, cert. denied, 439 U.S. 903, 99 S.Ct. 268, 58 L.Ed.2d 249 (1978). Petitioner subsequently was convicted of murder, and also received a capital sentence.  The Supreme Court of Georgia upheld the conviction and sentence, 242 Ga. 261, 249 S.E.2d 1 (1978), and petitioner has sought review of so much of the judgment as affirmed the capital sentence.

After the jury determined that petitioner was guilty of murder, a second trial was held to decide whether capital punishment would be imposed.  See Ga.Code &#167; 27-2503 (1978).  At this second proceeding, petitioner sought to prove he was not present when Allen was killed and had not participated in her death.  He attempted to introduce the testimony of Thomas Pasby, who had testified for the State at Moore's trial.  According to Pasby, Moore had confided to him that he had killed Allen, shooting her twice after ordering petitioner to run an errand. The trial court refused to allow introduction of this evidence, ruling that Pasby's testimony constituted hearsay that was inadmissible under Ga.Code &#167; 38-301 (1978).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The State then argued to the jury that in the absence of direct evidence as to the circumstances of the crime, it could infer that petitioner participated directly in Allen's murder from the fact that more than one bullet was fired into her body.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Regardless of whether the proffered testimony comes within Georgia's hearsay rule, under the facts of this case its exclusion constituted a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Moore made his statement spontaneously to a close friend.  The evidence corroborating the confession was ample, and indeed sufficient to procure a conviction of Moore and a capital sentence.  The statement was against interest, and there was no reason to believe that Moore had any ulterior motive in making it.  Perhaps most important, the State considered the testimony sufficiently reliable to use it against Moore, and to base a sentence of death upon it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In these unique circumstances, \"the hearsay rule may not be applied mechanistically to defeat the ends of justice.\" <i>Chambers v.

Instead, it marshals a number of ad hoc reasons why Georgia should adopt a code of evidence that would allow this particular testimony to be admitted, and concludes that \"[i]n these unique circumstances, 'the hearsay rule may not be applied mechanistically to defeat the ends of justice.' \"  <i>Ante</i>, at 97.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the United States Constitution gives this Court any authority to supersede a State's code of evidence because its application in a particular situation would defeat what this Court conceives to be \"the ends of justice.\"  The Court does not disagree that the testimony at issue is hearsay or that it fails to come within any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule provided by Georgia's rules of evidence.  The Court obviously is troubled by the fact that the same testimony was admissible at the separate trial of petitioner's codefendant at the behest of the State.  But this fact by no means demonstrates that the Georgia courts have not evenhandedly applied their code of evidence, with its various hearsay exceptions, so as to deny petitioner a fair trial.  No practicing lawyer can have failed to note that Georgia's evidentiary rules, like those of every other State and of the United States, are such that certain items of evidence may be introduced by one party, but not by another.  This is a fact of trial life, embodied throughout the hearsay rule and its exceptions.  This being the case, the United States Constitution must be strained to or beyond the breaking point to conclude that all capital defendants who are unable to introduce all of the evidence which they seek to admit are denied a fair trial.
