He filed this suit under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 alleging that the prison's grooming regulations violated his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The District Court dismissed his complaint, reasoning that the prison regulations promoted cleanliness and personal identification and that those valid objectives outweighed any religious freedom petitioner was entitled to enjoy under the Constitution.  By a single-judge order and without opinion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied petitioner's <i>pro se</i> application for leave to appeal <i>in forma pauperis</i>.  To support these rulings, respondents rely on <i>Brooks v. Wainwright</i>, 428 F.2d 652 (CA5 1970), which upheld the dismissal of a somewhat similar complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See also <i>Brown v.

Ruling that \"reasonable opportunities must be afforded to all prisoners to exercise the religious freedom guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments without fear of penalty,\" <i>id.</i>, at 322 n. 2, 92 S.Ct. 1079, the Court remanded the case for a hearing on the merits.
