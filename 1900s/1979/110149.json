In <i>Monroe v. Pape</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106170\"><a href=\"/opinion/106170/monroe-v-pape/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), this Court held that one seeking redress for the deprivation of federal rights need not <i>initiate</i> state proceedings before filing an action under &#167; 1983. 365 U.S., at 183, 81 S.Ct. 473.  Here, however, we are confronted by quite different and unanswered exhaustion issue&#8212;\"that of the deference to be accorded state proceedings <i>which have already been initiated</i> and which afford a competent tribunal for the resolution of federal issues.\"  Cf. <i>Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109216\"><a href=\"/opinion/109216/huffman-v-pursue-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></a></span>, 609-610, n. 21, 95 S.Ct. 1200, 43 L.Ed.2d 482 (1975) (emphasis added).  The District Court held that dismissal was in order under a doctrine that is best described as \"they who invoke must also exhaust.\"  Such a rule is not precluded by our prior decisions and indeed would seem to be supported by the logic of prior opinions. I would therefore grant certiorari to consider whether the Court of Appeals erred when it concluded that the District Court should have reached the merits of respondents' action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Principles of federal-state comity have given rise to a number of limitations on the exercise of federal jurisdiction over state laws and actions.

In <i>Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., supra</i>, for example, a state trial court ordered the respondent's theater closed and all personal property used in its operation seized and sold.  Rather than appealing this decision, the respondent brought a &#167; 1983 action in federal court seeking to enjoin enforcement of the state court's judgment.  We held that the Federal District Court's action in granting the injunction was improper under <i>Younger.</i>  Even though the state trial court judgment might have become final, \"a necessary concomitant of <i>Younger</i> is that a party  . . .  must exhaust his state appellate remedies before seeking relief in the District Court.\"  420 U.S., at 608, 95 S.Ct. 1200.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Virtually all of the evils at which <i>Younger</i> is directed      would inhere in federal intervention prior to completion of      state appellate proceedings, just as surely as they would if      such intervention occurred at or before trial.  Intervention at the later stage is if anything more highly      duplicative, since an entire trial has already taken place,      and it is also a direct aspersion on the capabilities and      good faith of state appellate courts.  . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Federal post-trial intervention, in a fashion designed      to annul the results of a state trial, also deprives the      States of a function which quite legitimately is left to      them, that of overseeing trial court dispositions of      constitutional issues which arise in civil litigation over      which they have jurisdiction.  We think this consideration to      be of some importance because it is typically a judicial      system's appellate courts which are by their nature a      litigant's most appropriate forum for the resolution of      constitutional contentions.  Especially is this true when, as      here, the constitutional issue involves a statute which is      capable of judicial narrowing.  In short, we do not believe      that a State's judicial system would be fairly accorded the      opportunity to resolve federal issues arising in its courts      if a federal district court were permitted to substitute      itself for the State's appellate courts.\"  <i>Id.</i>, at 608-609,      95 S.Ct. 1200.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the state proceedings were initiated by respondents rather than by the State.  But this only strengthens the rationale for requiring respondents to exhaust their state appellate remedies.  Respondents invoked the resources of the State to vindicate what they believed to have been illegal dismissals. Having lost the first round of this contest, they should not be allowed to abandon it and transfer the contest to another arena. As in <i>Huffman</i>, such belated forum shifting is \"highly duplicative\" and \"a direct aspersion on the capabilities and good faith of state appellate courts.\"  Action by a federal district court also would deprive the state appellate courts \"of a function which quite legitimately is left to them.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A requirement that respondents exhaust state remedies that they have themselves initiated is particularly appropriate here where respondents' claim for relief rests in part on state law. On appeal, the Georgia courts may well have found that the dismissal of respondents without a hearing was unlawful under Columbus City Ordinance No. 71-7 (1971), obviating much, if not all, of respondents' federal claim for relief and avoiding the federal constitutional issues that the District Court may now have to decide.  In <i>Boehning v. Indiana Employees Assn.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109324\"><a href=\"/opinion/109324/boehning-v-indiana-state-employees-assn-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 96 S.Ct. 168, 46 L.Ed.2d 148 (1975), a discharged employee brought suit in federal court under &#167; 1983 alleging procedural due process violations even though \"controlling state statutes, as yet unconstrued by the state courts, might require the hearing demanded  . . .  and so obviate decision on the constitutional issue.\"  423 U.S., at 6, 96 S.Ct. 168.  We held that under these circumstances the District Court properly decided to \"abstai[n] until construction of the Indiana statutes had been sought in the state courts.\"  <i>Ibid.</i>  The similar abstention concerns present here, in combination with respondents' invocation of their state remedies, support the District Court's dismissal of respondents' action because of their failure to exhaust state appellate remedies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted earlier, <i>Monroe v. Pape</i> is not to the contrary.  In <i>Monroe</i>, we merely held that a federal plaintiff need not <i>initiate</i> state proceedings before filing a &#167; 1983 action.  According to the Court, this conclusion flowed from the purpose of the Civil Rights Act \"to provide a federal remedy where the state remedy, though adequate in theory, <i>was not available in practice.</i>\"  365 U.S., at 174, 81 S.Ct. 473 (emphasis added).  Here, after deliberately invoking state review proceedings, respondents should not be heard to challenge the state procedures as either \"not available in practice\" or otherwise inadequate.  Nor indeed have respondents attempted to raise such a challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quite apart from this distinction, the time may now be ripe for a reconsideration of the Court's conclusion in <i>Monroe</i> that the \"federal remedy is supplementary to the state remedy, and the latter need not be first sought and refused before the federal one is invoked.\"   <i>Id.</i>, at 183, 81 S.Ct. 473.  As noted earlier, the Court believed that this conclusion followed from the purpose of the Civil Rights Act \"to provide a federal remedy where the state remedy, though adequate in theory, <i>was not available in practice</i>.\"  <i>Id.</i>, at 174, 81 S.Ct. 473 (emphasis added).  But this purpose need not bar exhaustion where the State can demonstrate that there is an available and adequate state remedy.  Indeed, scholarly commentators have soundly criticized the Court for holding to the contrary.  See, <i>e. g.</i>, Note, Limiting the Section 1983 Action in the Wake of Monroe v. Pape, 82 Harv.L.Rev. 1486 (1969).  In <i>Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span>, 663, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), the Court, in examining another section of <i>Monroe v. Pape</i>, \"overrule[d] <i>Monroe v. Pape</i>  . . .  insofar as it holds that local governments are wholly immune from suit under &#167; 1983.\"  The Court having reopened that portion of <i>Monroe v. Pape</i>, I would take the opportunity afforded by this case to reconsider the Court's conclusion as to exhaustion of state remedies.  Not only is the Court's conclusion open to serious question, as noted earlier, but the conclusion was reached in an almost off-the-cuff manner, in distinct contrast to that portion of <i>Monroe</i> overruled by the Court in <i>Monell.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all these reasons, I dissent from the denial of certiorari.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The second prayer of the respondents' complaint asked:</p>\n        <p>\"2.

In <i>Monroe v. Pape</i>, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), this Court held that one seeking redress for the deprivation of federal rights need not <i>initiate</i> state proceedings before filing an action under &#167; 1983. 365 U.S., at 183, 81 S.Ct. 473.  Here, however, we are confronted by quite different and unanswered exhaustion issue&#8212;\"that of the deference to be accorded state proceedings <i>which have already been initiated</i> and which afford a competent tribunal for the resolution of federal issues.\"  Cf. <i>Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd.</i>, 420 U.S. 592, 609-610, n. 21, 95 S.Ct. 1200, 43 L.Ed.2d 482 (1975) (emphasis added).  The District Court held that dismissal was in order under a doctrine that is best described as \"they who invoke must also exhaust.\"  Such a rule is not precluded by our prior decisions and indeed would seem to be supported by the logic of prior opinions. I would therefore grant certiorari to consider whether the Court of Appeals erred when it concluded that the District Court should have reached the merits of respondents' action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Principles of federal-state comity have given rise to a number of limitations on the exercise of federal jurisdiction over state laws and actions.  The equitable restraint doctrine enunciated in <i>Younger v. Harris</i>, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), holds that, absent \"exceptional circumstances,\" a federal court should not interfere with pending state criminal or civil proceedings in which the State has an important interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See, <i>e. g., Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., supra;  Juidice v. Vail</i>, 430 U.S. 327, 97 S.Ct. 1211, 51 L.Ed.2d 376 (1977);  <i>Trainor v. Hernandez</i>, 431 U.S. 434, 97 S.Ct. 1911, 52 L.Ed.2d 486 (1977);  <i>Moore v. Sims</i>, 442 U.S. 415, 99 S.Ct. 2371, 60 L.Ed.2d 994 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal action must be dismissed not only where it threatens to interfere with active state proceedings but also where state proceedings have ended because of the failure of the federal plaintiff to appeal an adverse state decision.  In <i>Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., supra</i>, for example, a state trial court ordered the respondent's theater closed and all personal property used in its operation seized and sold.  Rather than appealing this decision, the respondent brought a &#167; 1983 action in federal court seeking to enjoin enforcement of the state court's judgment.  We held that the Federal District Court's action in granting the injunction was improper under <i>Younger.</i>  Even though the state trial court judgment might have become final, \"a necessary concomitant of <i>Younger</i> is that a party  . . .  must exhaust his state appellate remedies before seeking relief in the District Court.\"  420 U.S., at 608, 95 S.Ct. 1200.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Virtually all of the evils at which <i>Younger</i> is directed      would inhere in federal intervention prior to completion of      state appellate proceedings, just as surely as they would if      such intervention occurred at or before trial.  Intervention at the later stage is if anything more highly      duplicative, since an entire trial has already taken place,      and it is also a direct aspersion on the capabilities and      good faith of state appellate courts.  . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Federal post-trial intervention, in a fashion designed      to annul the results of a state trial, also deprives the      States of a function which quite legitimately is left to      them, that of overseeing trial court dispositions of      constitutional issues which arise in civil litigation over      which they have jurisdiction.  We think this consideration to      be of some importance because it is typically a judicial      system's appellate courts which are by their nature a      litigant's most appropriate forum for the resolution of      constitutional contentions.  Especially is this true when, as      here, the constitutional issue involves a statute which is      capable of judicial narrowing.  In short, we do not believe      that a State's judicial system would be fairly accorded the      opportunity to resolve federal issues arising in its courts      if a federal district court were permitted to substitute      itself for the State's appellate courts.\"  <i>Id.</i>, at 608-609,      95 S.Ct. 1200.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the state proceedings were initiated by respondents rather than by the State.  But this only strengthens the rationale for requiring respondents to exhaust their state appellate remedies.  Respondents invoked the resources of the State to vindicate what they believed to have been illegal dismissals. Having lost the first round of this contest, they should not be allowed to abandon it and transfer the contest to another arena. As in <i>Huffman</i>, such belated forum shifting is \"highly duplicative\" and \"a direct aspersion on the capabilities and good faith of state appellate courts.\"  Action by a federal district court also would deprive the state appellate courts \"of a function which quite legitimately is left to them.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A requirement that respondents exhaust state remedies that they have themselves initiated is particularly appropriate here where respondents' claim for relief rests in part on state law. On appeal, the Georgia courts may well have found that the dismissal of respondents without a hearing was unlawful under Columbus City Ordinance No. 71-7 (1971), obviating much, if not all, of respondents' federal claim for relief and avoiding the federal constitutional issues that the District Court may now have to decide.  In <i>Boehning v. Indiana Employees Assn.</i>, 423 U.S. 6, 96 S.Ct. 168, 46 L.Ed.2d 148 (1975), a discharged employee brought suit in federal court under &#167; 1983 alleging procedural due process violations even though \"controlling state statutes, as yet unconstrued by the state courts, might require the hearing demanded  . . .  and so obviate decision on the constitutional issue.\"  423 U.S., at 6, 96 S.Ct. 168.  We held that under these circumstances the District Court properly decided to \"abstai[n] until construction of the Indiana statutes had been sought in the state courts.\"  <i>Ibid.</i>  The similar abstention concerns present here, in combination with respondents' invocation of their state remedies, support the District Court's dismissal of respondents' action because of their failure to exhaust state appellate remedies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted earlier, <i>Monroe v. Pape</i> is not to the contrary.  In <i>Monroe</i>, we merely held that a federal plaintiff need not <i>initiate</i> state proceedings before filing a &#167; 1983 action.  According to the Court, this conclusion flowed from the purpose of the Civil Rights Act \"to provide a federal remedy where the state remedy, though adequate in theory, <i>was not available in practice.</i>\"  365 U.S., at 174, 81 S.Ct. 473 (emphasis added).  Here, after deliberately invoking state review proceedings, respondents should not be heard to challenge the state procedures as either \"not available in practice\" or otherwise inadequate.  Nor indeed have respondents attempted to raise such a challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quite apart from this distinction, the time may now be ripe for a reconsideration of the Court's conclusion in <i>Monroe</i> that the \"federal remedy is supplementary to the state remedy, and the latter need not be first sought and refused before the federal one is invoked.\"   <i>Id.</i>, at 183, 81 S.Ct. 473.  As noted earlier, the Court believed that this conclusion followed from the purpose of the Civil Rights Act \"to provide a federal remedy where the state remedy, though adequate in theory, <i>was not available in practice</i>.\"  <i>Id.</i>, at 174, 81 S.Ct. 473 (emphasis added).  But this purpose need not bar exhaustion where the State can demonstrate that there is an available and adequate state remedy.  Indeed, scholarly commentators have soundly criticized the Court for holding to the contrary.  See, <i>e. g.</i>, Note, Limiting the Section 1983 Action in the Wake of Monroe v. Pape, 82 Harv.L.Rev. 1486 (1969).  In <i>Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services</i>, 436 U.S. 658, 663, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), the Court, in examining another section of <i>Monroe v. Pape</i>, \"overrule[d] <i>Monroe v. Pape</i>  . . .  insofar as it holds that local governments are wholly immune from suit under &#167; 1983.\"  The Court having reopened that portion of <i>Monroe v. Pape</i>, I would take the opportunity afforded by this case to reconsider the Court's conclusion as to exhaustion of state remedies.  Not only is the Court's conclusion open to serious question, as noted earlier, but the conclusion was reached in an almost off-the-cuff manner, in distinct contrast to that portion of <i>Monroe</i> overruled by the Court in <i>Monell.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all these reasons, I dissent from the denial of certiorari.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The second prayer of the respondents' complaint asked:</p>\n        <p>\"2.
