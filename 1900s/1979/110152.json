W. 2d 228 (Ky. 1976). The petitioner then filed a habeas corpus petition in a Federal District Court, alleging that the Kentucky conviction was supported by evidence insufficient to afford him due process of law. The federal court denied relief. Applying the \"no evidence\" test of <i>Thompson</i> v. <i>Louisville,</i> 362 U. S. 199 (1960), the court concluded that \"[a]lthough this was a close case on the evidence, we believe that the case was not devoid of an evidentiary basis for petitioner's conviction.\"<sup>[*]</sup> The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, also relying on the \"no evidence\" test, affirmed the denial of habeas corpus relief. 593 F. 2d 264.</p>\n<p>Thereafter, this Court in <i>Jackson</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 443 U. S. 307 (1979), held that the <i>Thompson</i> \"no evidence\" test is constitutionally inadequate in a case such as this. An earlier decision had made clear that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the criminal conviction of any person except upon proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>In re Winship,</i> 397 U. S. 358 (1970). The Court in <i>Jackson</i> held that this constitutional requirement can be effectuated only if a federal habeas corpus court, in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a state-court conviction, inquires \"whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 443 U.
