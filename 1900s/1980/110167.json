An exception is made only if the federal prosecution is specifically authorized in advance by the Department itself, upon a finding that the prosecution will serve \"compelling interests of federal law enforcement.\"<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*249</span> In this case the Solicitor General has advised us that this established Department policy was violated. Accordingly, he urges the Court \"to permit the effectuation of the government's policy against successive prosecutions by granting the petition, vacating the judgment of the court of appeals, and remanding the case to the district court with instructions to grant the government's motion to dismiss the indictment.\"</p>\n<p>In 1978, the petitioner was brought to trial in a Kentucky court on a charge of armed burglary, and was convicted by a jury of a lesser included offense. He was then prosecuted and convicted in a Federal District Court on a charge of unlawfully possessing a firearm\u0097a charge that grew out of the same criminal transaction that had been the basis of the Kentucky prosecution. This federal conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which accepted the Government's then position that the <i>\"Petite\"</i> policy had not been violated.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The Solicitor General now concedes that the United States Attorney did not obtain the authorization required under the established Department policy before bringing the federal prosecution. Moreover, \"after careful review\" of whether to grant <i>nunc pro tunc</i> authorization, the Solicitor General has concluded that \"petitioner's prosecution for unlawfully possessing a firearm was not supported by an independent compelling federal interest not satisfied by the state prosecution for armed burglary.\"</p>\n<p>Ever since the Justice Department established the <i>\"Petite\"</i> policy in 1959, the Court has consistently responded to requests by the Government in cases such as this by granting certiorari and vacating the judgments. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Hammons</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 439 U. S. 810 (1978); <i>Frakes</i> v. <i>United</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*250</span> <i>States,</i> 435 U.

C. \u00a7 2106,\" <i>Rinaldi</i> v. <i>United States, supra,</i> at 25, n. 8, is not unique to violations of the <i>\"Petite\"</i> policy.
