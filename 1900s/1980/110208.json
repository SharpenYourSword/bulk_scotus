On June 20, 1978, the Parole Commission held a hearing and revoked applicant's parole on the basis of the two convictions. The Commission applied its guidelines currently in force, 28 C.F.R. &#167; 2.21 (1978), in establishing applicant's next presumptive parole date, indicating that a customary range of 34 to 44 months would be served before re-release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applicant filed a writ of habeas corpus in federal court, and the trial judge granted the writ, ordering the Parole Commission to reconsider and determine applicant's parole eligibility under the standards for reparole in effect when the applicant was sentenced in April 1972.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, relying on its decision in <i>Rifai v.

Now, as in 1972, the Commission's determination to grant or deny parole is \"committed to agency discretion.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 4218(d).  The administrative guidelines articulating the factors relied on by the Commission in making parole and reparole decisions have changed from those in effect at the time of applicant's sentencing.  But even assuming for purposes of this application that the <i>Ex Post Facto</i> Clause applies to parole in the manner it does to trial and sentence, the changes in issue are not impermissible, as applicant contends.

The terms of the sentence originally imposed have in no way been altered. Applicant cannot be held in confinement beyond the term imposed by the judge, and at the time of his sentence he knew that parole violations would put him at risk of serving the balance of his sentence in federal custody.  The guidelines, therefore, neither deprive applicant of any pre-existing right nor enhance the punishment imposed.
