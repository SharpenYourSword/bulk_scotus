The question pertains to whether an <i>applicant</i> for state-mandated welfare benefits is entitled to a hearing under the procedural guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution before being denied welfare benefits for failure to meet the initial requirements imposed by state law.  The California courts themselves, in <i>Zobriscky v. Los Angeles County</i>, 28 Cal.App.3d 930, 105 Cal.Rptr. 121 (1972), have concluded that an applicant is not entitled to any hearing because, in the words of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, they \"refused to find general relief to be a protected property interest.\" <i>Griffeth v.
