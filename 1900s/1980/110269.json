United      States</i>, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 78 S.Ct. 514, 518, 2 L.Ed.2d 545      (1958), that they are conclusively presumed illegal without      further examination under the rule of reason generally      applied in Sherman Act cases.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A horizontal agreement to fix prices is the archetypal example of such a practice.  It has long been settled that an agreement to fix prices is unlawful <i>per se</i>.  It is no excuse that the prices fixed are themselves reasonable.  See, <i>e. g., United States v. Trenton Potteries Co.</i>, 273 U.S. 392, 397-398, 47 S.Ct. 377, 379, 71 L.Ed. 700 (1927);  <i>United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Assn.</i>, 166 U.S. 290, 340-341, 17 S.Ct. 540, 558-559, 41 L.Ed. 1007 (1897).  In <i>United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co.</i>, 310 U.S. 150, 60 S.Ct. 811, 84 L.Ed. 1129 (1940), we held that an agreement among competitors to engage in a program of buying surplus gasoline on the spot market in order to prevent prices from falling sharply was unlawful without any inquiry into the reasonableness of the program, even though there was no direct agreement on the actual prices to be maintained.  In the course of the opinion, the Court made clear that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"the machinery employed by a combination for price-fixing is      immaterial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Under the Sherman Act a combination formed for the      purpose and with the effect of raising, depressing, fixing,      pegging, or stabilizing the price of a commodity in      interstate or foreign commerce is illegal <i>per se</i>.\"   <i>Id.</i>, at      223, 60 S.Ct., at 844.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we have held agreements to be unlawful <i>per se</i> that had substantially less direct impact on price than the agreement alleged in this case.  For example, in <i>Sugar Institute v. United States</i>, 297 U.S. 553, 601-602, 56 S.Ct. 629, 643, 80 L.Ed. 859 (1936), the Court held unlawful an agreement to adhere to previously announced prices and terms of sale, even though advance price announcements are perfectly lawful and even though the particular prices and terms were not themselves fixed by private agreement.  Similarly, an agreement among competing firms of professional engineers to refuse to discuss prices with potential customers until after negotiations have resulted in the initial selection of an engineer was held unlawful without requiring further inquiry.  <i>National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, supra</i>, at 692-693, 98 S.Ct., at 1365-1366.  Indeed, a horizontal agreement among competitors to use a specific method of quoting prices may be unlawful.  Cf. <i>FTC v. Cement Institute</i>, 333 U.S. 683, 690-693, 68 S.Ct. 793, 798-799, 92 L.Ed. 1010 (1948).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is virtually self-evident that extending interest-free credit for a period of time is equivalent to giving a discount equal to the value of the use of the purchase price for that period of time.  Thus, credit terms must be characterized as an inseparable part of the price.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  An agreement to terminate the practice of giving credit is thus tantamount to an agreement to eliminate discounts, and thus falls squarely within the traditional <i>per se</i> rule against price fixing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  While it may be that the elimination of a practice of giving variable discounts will ultimately lead in a competitive market to corresponding decreases in the invoice price, that is surely not necessarily to be anticipated.  It is more realistic to view an agreement to eliminate credit sales as extinguishing one form of competition among the sellers.  In any event, when a particular concerted activity entails an obvious risk of anticompetitive impact with no apparent potentially redeeming value, the fact that a practice may turn out to be harmless in a particular set of circumstances will not prevent its being declared unlawful <i>per se</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority of the panel of the Court of Appeals suggested, however, that a horizontal agreement to eliminate credit sales may remove a barrier to other sellers who may wish to enter the market.  But in any case in which competitors are able to increase the price level or to curtail production by agreement, it could be argued that the agreement has the effect of making the market more attractive to potential new entrants.  If that potential justifies horizontal agreements among competitors imposing one kind of voluntary restraint or another on their competitive freedom, it would seem to follow that the more successful an agreement is in raising the price level, the safer it is from antitrust attack. Nothing could be more inconsistent with our cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can the informing function of the agreement, the increased price visibility, justify its restraint on the individual wholesaler's freedom to select his own prices and terms of sale.  For, again, it is obvious that any industrywide agreement on prices will result in a more accurate understanding of the terms offered by all parties to the agreement.  As the <i>Sugar Institute</i> case demonstrates, however, there is a plain distinction between the lawful right to publish prices and terms of sale, on the one hand, and an agreement among competitors limiting action with respect to the published prices, on the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, under the reasoning of our cases, an agreement among competing wholesalers to refuse to sell unless the retailer makes payment in cash either in advance or upon delivery is \"plainly anticompetitive.\"  Since it is merely one form of price fixing, and since price-fixing agreements have been adjudged to lack any \"redeeming virtue,\" it is conclusively presumed illegal without further examination under the rule of reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>It is so ordered</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Title 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(b) provides:</p>\n        <p>\"When a district judge, in making in a civil action an order not otherwise appealable under this section, shall be of the opinion that such order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, he shall so state in writing in such order.

It has long been settled that an agreement to fix prices is unlawful <i>per se.</i> It is no excuse that the prices fixed are themselves reasonable. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>Trenton Potteries Co.,</i> 273 U. S. 392, 397-398 (1927); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Trans-Missouri Freight Assn.,</i> 166 U. S. 290, 340-341 (1897). In <i>United States</i> v. <i>Socony-Vacuum Oil Co.,</i> 310 U. S. 150 (1940), we held that an agreement among competitors to engage in a program of buying surplus gasoline on the spot market in order to prevent prices from falling sharply was unlawful without any inquiry into the reasonableness of the program, even though there was no direct agreement on the actual prices to be maintained. In the course of the opinion, the Court made clear that</p>\n<blockquote>\"the machinery employed by a combination for price-fixing is immaterial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Under the Sherman Act a combination formed for the purpose and with the effect of raising, depressing, fixing, pegging, or stabilizing the price of a commodity in interstate or foreign commerce is illegal <i>per se.\" Id.,</i> at 223.</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, we have held agreements to be unlawful <i>per se</i> that had substantially less direct impact on price than the agreement alleged in this case. For example, in <i>Sugar Institute</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 297 U. S. 553, 601-602 (1936), the Court held unlawful an agreement to adhere to previously announced prices and terms of sale, even though advance price announcements are perfectly lawful and even though the particular prices and terms were not themselves fixed by private agreement. Similarly, an agreement among competing firms of professional engineers to refuse to discuss prices with potential customers until after negotiations have resulted in the initial selection of an engineer was held unlawful without requiring further inquiry. <i>National Society of Professional Engineers</i> v. <i>United States, supra,</i> at 692-693. Indeed, a horizontal agreement among competitors to use a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*648</span> specific method of quoting prices may be unlawful. Cf. <i>FTC</i> v. <i>Cement Institute,</i> 333 U. S. 683, 690-693 (1948).<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>It is virtually self-evident that extending interest-free credit for a period of time is equivalent to giving a discount equal to the value of the use of the purchase price for that period of time. Thus, credit terms must be characterized as an inseparable part of the price.<sup>[11]</sup> An agreement to terminate the practice of giving credit is thus tantamount to an agreement to eliminate discounts, and thus falls squarely within the traditional <i>per se</i> rule against price fixing.<sup>[12]</sup> While it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*649</span> may be that the elimination of a practice of giving variable discounts will ultimately lead in a competitive market to corresponding decreases in the invoice price, that is surely not necessarily to be anticipated. It is more realistic to view an agreement to eliminate credit sales as extinguishing one form of competition among the sellers. In any event, when a particular concerted activity entails an obvious risk of anti-competitive impact with no apparent potentially redeeming value, the fact that a practice may turn out to be harmless in a particular set of circumstances will not prevent its being declared unlawful <i>per se.</i></p>\n<p>The majority of the panel of the Court of Appeals suggested, however, that a horizontal agreement to eliminate credit sales may remove a barrier to other sellers who may wish to enter the market. But in any case in which competitors are able to increase the price level or to curtail production by agreement, it could be argued that the agreement has the effect of making the market more attractive to potential new entrants. If that potential justifies horizontal agreements among competitors imposing one kind of voluntary restraint or another on their competitive freedom, it would seem to follow that the more successful an agreement is in raising the price level, the safer it is from antitrust attack. Nothing could be more inconsistent with our cases.</p>\n<p>Nor can the informing function of the agreement, the increased price visibility, justify its restraint on the individual wholesaler's freedom to select his own prices and terms of sale. For, again, it is obvious that any industry wide agreement on prices will result in a more accurate understanding of the terms offered by all parties to the agreement. As the <i>Sugar Institute</i> case demonstrates, however, there is a plain distinction between the lawful right to publish prices and terms of sale, on the one hand, and an agreement among competitiors <span class=\"star-pagination\">*650</span> limiting action with respect to the published prices, on the other.</p>\n<p>Thus, under the reasoning of our cases, an agreement among competing wholesalers to refuse to sell unless the retailer makes payment in cash either in advance or upon delivery is \"plainly anticompetitive.\" Since it is merely one form of price fixing, and since price-fixing agreements have been adjudged to lack any \"redeeming virtue,\" it is conclusively presumed illegal without further examination under the rule of reason.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Title 28 U.

S. C. § 1. The District Court entered an interlocutory order, which among other things, denied petitioners' \"motion to declare this a case of <i>per se</i> illegality,\" and then certified to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1292 (b),<sup>[1]</sup> the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*644</span> question whether the alleged agreement among competitors fixing credit terms, if proved, was unlawful on its face.<sup>[2]</sup> The Court of Appeals granted permission to appeal, and, with one judge dissenting, agreed with the District Court that a horizontal agreement among competitors to fix credit terms does not necessarily contravene the antitrust laws. 605 F. 2d 1097 (1979).<sup>[3]</sup> We grant the petition for certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>For purposes of decision we assume the following facts alleged in the amended complaint<sup>[4]</sup> to be true. Petitioners allege that, beginning in early 1967, respondent wholesalers secretly agreed, in order to eliminate competition among themselves, that as of December 1967 they would sell to retailers only if payment were made in advance or upon delivery. Prior to the agreement, the wholesalers had extended credit without interest up to the 30- and 42-day limits permitted by state law.<sup>[5]</sup> According to the petition, prior to the agreement wholesalers had competed with each other with respect <span class=\"star-pagination\">*645</span> to trade credit, and the credit terms for individual retailers had varied substantially.<sup>[6]</sup> After entering into the agreement, respondents uniformly refused to extend any credit at all.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals decided that the credit-fixing agreement should not be characterized as a form of price fixing. The court suggested that such an agreement might actually enhance competition in two ways: (1) \"by removing a barrier perceived by some sellers to market entry,\" and (2) \"by the increased visibility of price made possible by the agreement to eliminate credit.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1099.</p>\n<p>In dissent, Judge Blumenfeld<sup>[7]</sup> expressed the opinion that an agreement to eliminate credit was a form of price fixing. <i>Id.,</i> at 1104. He reasoned that the extension of interest-free credit is an indirect price reduction and that the elimination of such credit is therefore a method of raising prices:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The purchase of goods creates an obligation to pay for them. Credit is one component of the overall price paid for a product. The cost to a retailer of purchasing goods consists of (1) the amount he has to pay to obtain the goods, and (2) the date on which he has to make that payment. If there is a differential between a purchase for cash and one on time, that difference is not interest but part of the price. See <i>Hogg</i> v. <i>Ruffner,</i> 66 U. S. (1 Black) 115, 118-119 . . . (1861). Allowing a retailer interest-free short-term credit on beer purchases effectively reduces the price of beer, when compared to a requirement that the retailer pay the same amount immediately in cash; and, conversely, the elimination of free credit is the equivalent of a price increase.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1103.</blockquote>\n<p>It followed, in his view, that the agreement was just as plainly anticompetitive as a direct agreement to raise prices. Consequently, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*646</span> no further inquiry under the rule of reason, see <i>National Society of Professional Engineers</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 435 U. S. 679 (1978), was required in order to establish the agreement's unlawfulness.</p>\n<p>Our cases fully support Judge Blumenfeld's analysis and foreclose both of the possible justifications on which the majority relied.<sup>[8]</sup> In <i>Broadcast Music, Inc.</i> v. <i>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.,</i> 441 U.
