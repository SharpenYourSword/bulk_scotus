In <i>Keeble</i>, the Court held that an Indian charged with a federal crime under the Major Crimes Act was entitled to an instruction on a lesser included offense even though the Act did not confer federal jurisdiction over the defendant for the lesser crime.  The Court explained the value of such a safeguard:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[I]f the prosecution has not established beyond a reasonable      doubt every element of the offense charged, and if no lesser      offense instruction is offered, the jury must, as a      theoretical matter, return a verdict of acquittal.  But a      defendant is entitled to a lesser offense instruction-in this      context or any other-precisely because he should not be      exposed to the substantial risk that the jury's practice will      diverge from theory.  Where one of the elements of the      offense charged remains in doubt, but the defendant is      plainly guilty of <i>some</i> offense, the jury is likely to resolve      its doubts in favor of conviction.\"  (Emphasis in original).      412 U.S., at 212-213, 93 S.Ct. at 1997-1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More recently, in <i>Beck v.

In reaffirming the Court's commitment to the lesser-offense doctrine, the Court observed that \"the nearly universal acceptance of the rule in both state and federal courts establishes the value to the defendant of this procedural safeguard.\"  447 U.S., at 637, 100 S.Ct., at 2389.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus the Court more than once has expressed the understanding that a lesser-included-offense option minimizes the risk of undermining the reasonable-doubt standard.
