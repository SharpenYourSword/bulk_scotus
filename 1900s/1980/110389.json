Although respondent by its formal answer denied liability, the real issue in the litigation proved to be the amount for which respondent was liable.  Petitioner-shipper took the position that, under <i>Gore Products, Inc. v. Texas &amp; N. O. R. Co.</i>, 34 So.2d 418 (La.App.1948), the proper measure of damages was the profit lost by petitioner on the completed sale, or $7,529.28. Respondent-carrier, on the other hand, contended that the proper measure was the cost of reprocessing the sugar for resale to another customer, or $488.65.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Respondent moved for partial summary judgment only on the issue of the quantum of damages. Over petitioner's objection, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana granted that motion, leaving open, so far as that court was concerned, the issue of liability.  The partial summary judgment, being interlocutory, of course was not then appealable.
