In 1965, he applied to the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the Interior for a patent covering five 20-acre placer mining claims for cinders on land on which he claimed to have discovered \"valuable mineral deposits.\"  Respondent's claims covered an estimated 15 million tons of cinders.  At the request of the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture, the Bureau issued an administrative contest complaint seeking cancellation of those claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Over the period from 1953 to 1976, respondent extracted and marketed less than one million tons;  of this amount, a substantial portion was sold for purposes not cognizable under the mining laws.  The Secretary considered these factors, along with the marginal profitability of the local cinders market, in concluding that respondent's total reserves far exceeded reasonable market demand for the foreseeable future.  While validating two of respondent's claims, the Interior Board of Land Appeals nullified two others, reasoning that development of all four claims would be imprudent.  23 I.B.L.A. 319 (1976).  Respondents sought judicial review in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona.  On cross-motions for summary judgment, that court affirmed the agency's decision.  The Court of Appeals, however, vacated and remanded, holding that the Secretary had exceeded his statutory powers in relying on an \"excess reserves\" analysis to limit the patentability of a mineral claim.  613 F.2d 224 (CA9 1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two complementary methods for determining whether a mineral deposit is of value have been developed over time.

In light of that ruling, one now may expect the assertion of additional claims involving \"valuable\" mineral deposits not marketable in the foreseeable future.  This can, and probably will, result in the withdrawal of vast acreage from the public domain for purposes unrelated to mining.
