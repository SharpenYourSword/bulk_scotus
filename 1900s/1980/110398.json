This is especially true when unprotected speech, such as obscenity or threats of physical violence, is involved.  But it is equally clear that a State may not pursue these interests by unduly infringing on what would otherwise be protected speech.  It is therefore critical to recall that speech may be \"annoying\" without losing its First Amendment protection<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and that the Connecticut statute on its face criminalizes any telephone call that annoys and was intended to do so.  It is not difficult to imagine various clearly protected telephone communications that would fall within the ban of the Connecticut statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  As such it is fairly arguable that the statute is substantially overbroad and hence unconstitutional. <i>Lewis v.
