Addressing the constitutional requirement that the parties have a \"personal stake in the outcome\" of the litigation, the Court found such a \"stake\" in the dilemma that the appellants confronted:  a choice between violating their oaths of office to support the United States Constitution or refusing to comply with the statutory requirements, a step which was \"likely to bring their expulsion from office and also a reduction in state funds for their school districts.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 241, n. 5, 88 S.Ct., at 1925, n. 5.

Cal.Gov't Code Ann. &#167; 67040 <i>et seq</i>. (West Supp.1980). The city of South Lake Tahoe lies within the geographic area regulated by the CTRPA.  Petitioners, the city, its Mayor and four council members, are required by law to enforce CTRPA regulations, Cal.Gov't Code Ann. &#167;&#167; 67072, 67102 (West Supp.1980).  A willful failure of a state official to perform his duty is a misdemeanor, Cal.Gov't Code Ann. &#167; 1222 (West 1980), which may result in removal from office.

I do not doubt the validity of this principle. See <i>Los Angeles v.

It was this dilemma that created a personal stake in the controversy and that distinguishes their situation from that of the parties in either <i>Schlesinger</i> or <i>Richardson</i>.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Nor is it sufficient to argue that this dilemma could be avoided simply by resignation, as suggested by the concurring opinion below:  this alternative only further distinguishes the plaintiffs from other citizens and demonstrates their concrete interests in the controversy.
