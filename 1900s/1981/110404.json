The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit examined the Delaware statutory provisions and regulations governing work release programs in light of <i>Greenholtz</i> and concluded that a liberty interest was implicated when respondent was denied work release.  The court conceded that Delaware prison officials exercise substantial discretion in making work release decisions but concluded that their discretion is not unbounded.  It determined that under Delaware law prison officials must exercise their discretion \"consistently with the purpose and policy behind work release.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The court also observed that the State had established \"an elaborate institutional system\" for processing work release applications.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Two separate committees must evaluate the inmate's fitness for work release and recommend that work release be granted before the inmate's application may be submitted to the prison superintendent.  In light of this three-tier review system, the court concluded that the superintendent could not reject work release applications for reasons that were unrelated to the purposes of the work release program.  Since Delaware prison officials do not have unlimited discretion to deny work release to an inmate who meets the basic criteria for eligibility, the Court of Appeals held that under <i>Greenholtz</i> respondent had established an \"expectancy of [work] release\" that was entitled to constitutional protection.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The court clearly rejected the view expressed in the dissenting opinion that respondent could not prevail under the standard established in <i>Greenholtz</i> since Delaware law does not provide that an eligible inmate <i>shall</i> be granted work release <i>unless</i> prison authorities determine, based on certain statutory criteria, that work release ought to be denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We did not expressly state in <i>Greenholtz</i> that the \"shall . . . unless\" language of the Nebraska statute was the critical factor underlying our determination that the statute created a liberty interest.  However, other Courts of Appeals have examined parole release statutes lacking mandatory language and have concluded in light of <i>Greenholtz</i> that those statutes do not create liberty interests.
