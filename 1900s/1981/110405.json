Specifically, respondents alleged that the Commission had failed to prepare an environmental impact statement for the EPICOR II system, in violation of NEPA, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 4332, and had failed to require petitioners to secure a license or construction permit for the system, in violation of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 68 Stat. 919, as amended, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2011 <i>et seq.</i>  The complaint also charged that the possible discharge of \"high-level radioactive\" water into the river would violate both the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), &#167; 301(f), 86 Stat. 846, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1311(f), and a federal constitutional right to \"be born and to live mentally and physically unimpaired.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court found that respondents had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies under the Atomic Energy Act and dismissed the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.
