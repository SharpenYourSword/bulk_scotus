The Court divided three ways in <i>Brown</i>, and it is essential for our present purposes to identify the divergent views.  Justice BRENNAN wrote for a plurality of four Justices and concluded that any conviction reached by a nonunanimous six-member jury should be reversed.  Two other Justices concurred in the result, stating that <i>Burch</i> should be applied retroactively only to cases pending on direct review at the time <i>Burch</i> was decided.  447 U.S., at 337, 100 S.Ct., at 2224 (POWELL, J., with whom STEVENS, J., joined), quoting <i>Hankerson v.

Though the system challenged in each case differed somewhat, we invalidated each one for essentially the same reason:  the Constitution requires that criminal juries be structured in a manner conducive to highly reliable adjudication.  <i>Ballew, supra</i>, 435 U.S., at 232, 234, 98 S.Ct., at 1035, 1036 (opinion of BLACKMUN, J.);  <i>Burch, supra</i>, 441 U.S., at 137, 99 S.Ct., at 1627.  It does not follow from either case, however, that unanimous five-member juries and nonunanimous six-member juries frequently&#8212;or even occasionally&#8212;render incorrect decisions.  A criminal defendant's interest in a new trial, based on <i>post hoc</i> \"speculation about what would have happened\" with a jury of different size or structure, <i>Brown v.
