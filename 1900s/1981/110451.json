In my view, the award of attorney's fees in such a situation is not authorized by any statute, and I dissent from the denial of the petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondents brought this action under 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1981 and 1983 against officials of the city of San Francisco and its police department challenging certain police practices which took place in April 1974 during what became known as \"Operation Zebra.\" Beginning in late 1973, a series of vicious random killings and attempted killings took place on the streets of San Francisco. These murders became known as the \"Zebra\" killings.  Between December 1973 and April 1974, 12 persons were murdered and 6 others were wounded.  The police department of San Francisco responded to this violence by initiating a special investigatorial procedure known as \"Operation Zebra\" to attempt to identify and capture the killers.  Police directives and memoranda authorized officers to stop and frisk black males resembling two composite drawings and having described physical characteristics.  Over 600 persons were stopped and \"pat searched\" in the course of the operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondents brought two separate actions seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of black males who were stopped or were subject to being stopped pursuant to Operation Zebra practices.  The District Court preliminarily enjoined the police procedure and also concluded that respondents were entitled to attorney's fees.  Petitioners appealed the entry of the preliminary injunction but before the appeal was heard the Zebra killers were apprehended, convicted, and sentenced.  The police investigation of the Zebra killings having ceased, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal as moot and the judgment of the District Court was vacated.  <i>Williams v.

Subsequently, the District Court entered an order awarding respondents a total of $45,000 in attorney's fees.  The Court of Appeals affirmed that order, finding that \"by obtaining the preliminary injunction [respondents] 'prevailed on the merits of at least some of their claims.' . . .
