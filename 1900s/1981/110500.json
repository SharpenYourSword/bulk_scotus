Chief Judge Edwards dissented, reasoning that summary judgment is improperly invoked where, as here, the defendant's motive and intent in discharging the plaintiff is at issue.  Because I believe that petitioner raised a triable issue of fact under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, I believe that it was error to grant respondent's motion for summary judgment.

Summary judgment simply may not be granted when such matters as the defendant's motive and intent are questioned.  Thus in any suit where the defendant is not accorded <i>absolute</i> immunity, so that the defendant's state of mind is at issue, it will not require an ingenious advocate to force a trial of the case.  It seems to me that even the most frivolous lawsuits filed against top-level federal officials will have to be tried. Indeed, that is one reason why I dissented in <i>Butz v.
