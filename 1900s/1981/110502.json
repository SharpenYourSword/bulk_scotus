The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in this case followed the former rule but not the latter and, on the strength of this possible error, ordered released from prison a person convicted of voluntary manslaughter whose conviction had been affirmed on direct appeal and state habeas corpus.  Because I believe that it is for Georgia, and not the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, to define the elements of the crime of voluntary manslaughter, under Georgia law, I would grant plenary consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondent Holloway was tried before a Georgia jury for murder and convicted of the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter.  Under Georgia law, \"[a] person commits murder when he unlawfully and with malice aforethought, either express or implied, causes the death of another human being.\"  Ga.Code &#167; 26-1101(a) (1978).  Voluntary manslaughter is defined as causing the death of another human being under circumstances which would otherwise be murder if the killer \"acts solely as the result of a sudden, violent, and irresistible passion resulting from serious provocation sufficient to excite such passion in a reasonable person.\"  &#167; 26-1102.  Respondent admitted that he intentionally killed the victim but claimed that he acted in self-defense. Georgia law recognizes the defense of self-defense, &#167; 26-902, and explicitly provides that a claim of self-defense \"is an affirmative defense.\"  &#167; 26-907.  The trial judge accordingly instructed the jury, without objection from respondent's counsel, that after the State had proved an intentional homicide \"<i>the burden is on the slayer</i>\" to show that the killing was justified, in this case, by self-defense.  632 F.2d, at 619 (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondent appealed his conviction, but did not raise any <i>Mullaney</i> issue.  The Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed, 137 Ga.App. 124, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1341572\"><a href=\"/opinion/1341572/holloway-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">898</span></a></span> (1975), and the Georgia Supreme Court denied certiorari.  Respondent then sought federal habeas relief, but the District Court dismissed his application without prejudice for failure to exhaust, suggesting <i>sua sponte</i> that the trial court's instruction was \" 'notably suspect under the principles of <i>Mullaney v. Wilbur</i>.' \"  632 F.2d, at 614.  The state trial court denied state habeas relief, and the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed.  Rejecting respondent's <i>Mullaney</i> claim, the Georgia Supreme Court ruled that: \"The burden placed on the defendant to excuse the homicide is an affirmative defense.  Code Ann. &#167; 26-907.  The defendant is not required to negate any of the elements of the crime which the state must prove to convict.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1261716\"><a href=\"/opinion/1261716/holloway-v-mcelroy/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ga.</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span>, 401, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1261716\"><a href=\"/opinion/1261716/holloway-v-mcelroy/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span>, 659 (1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondent thereupon again sought federal habeas relief, which this time was granted on the ground that the instruction impermissibly shifted the burden of proof from the State.  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.  After stating that \"the statute's characterization of self-defense as an 'affirmative defense' tells us nothing about the burden of persuasion on the self-defense issue,\" 632 F.2d at 630, the court concluded that since an element of the crime for which respondent was convicted was that the killing be \"unlawful,\" and self-defense negates that element, requiring the defendant to prove that he acted in self-defense relieves the State of its burden of proving the unlawfulness of the killing.  The court noted that \"[t]he State has not cited, and our research has not found, any case from the Georgia courts which holds that the absence of self-defense has . . . been read out of the requirement of unlawfulness.\"  <i>Id.</i>, at 634.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A common-sense reading of a statutory characterization of a defense as an \"affirmative defense,\" however, certainly suggests that its absence is not an \"element of the crime\" which the State must prove.  But more significantly, that is the exact reading given to this statutory characterization of self-defense as an affirmative defense by the Supreme Court of Georgia in the opinion which denied this very respondent state habeas relief.  In the words of that court, the putting of the burden of proof on the defendant to prove self-defense is not requiring him to \"negate any of the elements of the crime which the state must prove to convict.\"  241 Ga., at 401, 245 S.E.2d, at 659.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Patterson v.

It is doubtful that any state legislature would intend such a result;  the Georgia Supreme Court in this case has told us that the Georgia Legislature did not.  As stated in <i>Mullaney</i> itself, \"state courts are the ultimate expositors of state law . . . and . . . we are bound by their constructions.\" 421 U.S., at 691, 95 S.Ct., at 1886.  In <i>Patterson</i> we recognized that the rule that the definition of the elements of a crime is a state-law matter would permit state legislatures to allocate burdens of proof \"by labeling as affirmative defenses\" that which could otherwise be considered elements of a crime.  432 U.S., at 210, 97 S.Ct., at 2327.
