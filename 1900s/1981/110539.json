Over the objections of petitioners, his superiors, respondent desired to run for the office of County Sheriff.  The chief of the local police force, Chief Brown, also desired to run for that office.  Chief Brown was involved in an accident, and respondent approved an accident report which stated among other things that Brown had been drinking.  The next morning petitioners, at the request of Chief Brown, had the accident report changed so as to read \"Not known if drinking.\"  Respondent objected to the modified accident report, and disclosed these events to his father, who in turn leaked the original and altered accident reports to the press.  When petitioners learned of the leak, they fired respondent.

Petitioners also contended that they were entitled to \"official immunity\" from damages, in that they had in good faith discharged respondent for violating the department's policy against disclosing confidential police investigative reports.  See <i>Wood v.

Because the evidence of the confidentiality policy was inadmissible, the court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to warrant a jury instruction as to the existence of \"good-faith\" immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems to me that the Court of Appeals' six-prong \"test\" unjustifiably expands the principles announced in such cases as <i>Wood</i> and <i>Scheuer</i>.  In those cases, we held that official immunity is available where there is evidence that the official has a subjective good-faith belief in the lawfulness of his action and where the action is not inconsistent with undisputed and settled law.

Board of Education</i>, <i>supra</i>.  Petitioners argued that they should have been permitted to show the necessity of maintaining discipline in a organization such as a police department and to show how respondent's conduct leads to a breakdown of that discipline.  The Court of Appeals disagreed, finding that the District Court correctly found that respondent's First Amendment interests outweighed petitioners' interests in maintaining discipline.  629 F.2d, at 1003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I disagree.  In <i>Pickering</i>, the Court held that whether speech of a public employee is protected depends upon \"a balance between the interests of the [employee] as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\"  391 U.S., at 568, 88 S.Ct., at 1734.  But we also recognized that even accurate public criticism of a superior by a subordinate might warrant dismissal where the relationship between superior and subordinate is of such a nature that public criticism would seriously impair the working relationship between them.  <i>Id.</i>, at 570, n. 3, 88 S.Ct., at 1735, n. 3.  As the late Judge Leventhal explained in <i>Meehan v.

We believe that Meehan cannot fairly claim that discharge      following an attack like that presented by this record comes      as an unfair surprise or is so unexpected and uncertain as to      chill his freedom to engage in appropriate speech.\"      (Footnote omitted.) In this case, I believe that the Court of Appeals struck the wrong balance.  As it itself acknowledged:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Viewed in the light most favorable to [petitioners], it      was established that the 'leak' of the altered report would      irreparably damage the working relationship between      [petitioners] and Williams.  Although Saye was not Williams'      immediate superior, there was frequent communication and      necessity for working together.  It is clear, therefore, that      disharmony would result.  Additionally, as [petitioners]      argue, discipline is a necessary component of a      smoothly-operating police force.  Although this necessity of      discipline does not rise to the same level as required by the      military, see <i>Parker v.

In my view, the court gave too little weight to the need for maintaining a close working relationship in a quasi-military organization like a police department.  And quite unlike the situation in <i>Pickering</i>, respondent's actions here called into question the integrity of his immediate superiors with whom he worked daily.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More significantly, I believe that the decision here conflicts with those of other Circuits.

It concluded that the public criticism of the District Attorney by his first assistant precluded any future working relationship between the parties and hence was unprotected.  See <i>Clark v. Holmes</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">928</span></span> (CA7 1972), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">972</span></span>, 93 S.Ct. 2148, 36 L.Ed.2d 695 (1973).  Likewise in this case, I believe petitioners should have been permitted to introduce evidence as to the breakdown of a minimally acceptable working relationship between the parties as well as to the maintenance of necessary police department discipline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in one context, I can understand why this case is not a particularly attractive candidate for review.  Like so many other cases, it involves a number of factual disputes, with conflicting evidence on both sides.  Nonetheless, the legal issues presented by the case&#8212;whether the trial court erred in refusing to admit into evidence material going to \"qualified immunity\" and <i>Pickering</i> defenses&#8212;are sufficiently isolated from the factual controversies so as to make this case a suitable vehicle for review.  I would grant certiorari to consider those legal issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
