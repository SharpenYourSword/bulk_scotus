The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the terms of the Nonintercourse statute apply to all land throughout the United States.

Respondent claimed that it owned this land from \"time immemorial\" and that the land was subsequently acquired from respondent without the approval of the United States, in violation of the Nonintercourse statute of 1790 and its successor statutes.

Petitioner argued that the Nonintercourse statute applies only to Indian land in \"Indian country,\" which would be primarily western lands as defined in the various Indian Trade and Intercourse Acts, and not to all Indian land. Petitioner also pointed to a provision in several of the Nonintercourse statutes which stated that nothing in the statute prohibited trade or intercourse with Indians living on land \"surrounded by settlements.\"  See <i>id.</i>, at 618.  It was petitioner's view that Indian land in Connecticut was exempt from the provisions of the Nonintercourse statute, since it was clearly \"surrounded by settlements.\"  The court observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In these suits, [petitioner] states have marshalled      historical evidence which suggests that the eastern Indian      tribes and their lands were always understood to be under the      jurisdiction of the states.
