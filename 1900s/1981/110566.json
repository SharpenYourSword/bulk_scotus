The funds were repaid by February 1978.  A formal hearing was conducted by the Committee on April 30, 1980. The Committee recommended leniency.  A hearing then was held by the Disciplinary Review Board of the Supreme Court of New Jersey which recommended that Strickland be suspended for five years commencing November 15, 1975.  On February 3, 1981, the Supreme Court of New Jersey adopted the recommendation of the Disciplinary Review Board.

Strickland states that he has not practiced law since November 1975, has admitted his defalcations, and has made restitution.  Since July 1977, he has been employed as an investigator and administrative analyst by the Essex County Welfare Board.  Having been reinstated to the practice of law by the Supreme Court of New Jersey, Strickland intends to re-enter private practice specializing in the area of welfare law.

With deference to the Supreme Court of New Jersey's decisions, this Court is not, and must never be, bound by a state court's decision as it relates to our decision based on a record such as we find in this case.  A state court, when disciplining an attorney, deals directly with the attorney's livelihood.
