Respondent, Isadore Serrano, was convicted of the murder of Debra Gomez in Sunnyside Park, East Chicago, Ind.  At trial, Norma Hernandez testified that Serrano had told her that he had killed Gomez.  The respondent was represented by William Walker.  Upon cross-examination, Mrs. Hernandez stated that the firm of Walker &amp; Walker had represented her on a traffic ticket in the past and that she had asked William Walker to represent her on a pending robbery charge, unrelated to the Gomez slaying.  Serrano did not challenge the effectiveness of counsel in his appeal to the Indiana Supreme Court, which affirmed his conviction, <i>Serrano v.

While acknowledging that the ineffective-assistance argument had never been presented to the state courts, the court nevertheless decided that \"in view of the clear violation\" of respondent's rights and \"in the interest of judicial economy,\" there was no reason to await the state court's consideration of the issue.

It is likely that in most cases the violation would not be so \"clear\" and that state prisoners would be directed to seek relief in the state system. Moreover, even when such clear violations are found, considerations of federal-state comity would still inhere, and it would be unseemly in our dual system of government for the federal courts to upset a state-court conviction without affording to the state courts the opportunity to correct a constitutional violation.  <i>Picard v.
