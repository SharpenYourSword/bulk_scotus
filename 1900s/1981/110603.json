Respondent had brought an action under 42 U. S. C. &#167; 1983 claiming that he had been denied constitutional rights as a result of prison procedures set in motion by the stabbing of a correctional officer at one of the Illinois state prisons, even though he was ultimately exonerated by those procedures.  The District Court divided respondent's complaint into two parts:  a claim of denial of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by reason of the conduct of the hearing before the prison Adjustment Committee in 1976, and a claim that he was denied his \"civil rights\" when he was transferred to another prison in the system without a hearing. The District Court discussed the 1976 hearing in some detail, and found no violation of due process.  In addition, the District Court found that respondent's transfer without a hearing raised no constitutional issue because of our decision in <i>Meachum v. Fano</i>, 427 U.S. 215, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976).

Rowe</i>, 643 F.2d 1281 (CA 7 1981).  The Court of Appeals stated that \"Chavis' failure to name a particular defendant in connection with his Eighth Amendment allegation is no bar to this claim.\"  <i>Id.</i>, at 1290, n. 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe that this Court should grant petitioners' request for review of the manner in which the Court of Appeals treated the respondent's due process claim.  At a hearing on October 2, 1976, the Adjustment Committee dismissed the correctional officer's \"ticket\" as \"improperly written\".  <i>Id.</i>, at 1283.  The following week, another correctional officer who was also a member of the Adjustment Committee wrote a second \"Inmate Violation Report\" charging respondent with the assault and stabbing.  After a series of proceedings and appeals within the Illinois prison system, the Acting Director of the Illinois Department of Corrections, following the recommendation of a Review Board, ordered that the disciplinary report against respondent be expunged from all institutional records, that respondent be released from the segregation in which he had been confined since October, and that his two years of statutory good time be restored.  <i>Id.</i>, at 1284.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court of Appeals thought that the system of prison disciplinary hearings and review established by the State of Illinois did not meet the standards of<i>Wolff v.

It was of the view that the Adjustment Committee's failure to disclose to respondent an investigatory report containing statements by a witness to the stabbing incident violated this Court's decisions in <i>Brady v. Maryland</i>, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and <i>United States v.
