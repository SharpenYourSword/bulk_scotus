It held that reasonable suspicion is adequate to support warrantless installation of a beeper because of the limited expectation of privacy in an automobile, because the intrusion occasioned by the placement of the beeper is minimal, and because the important Government interest in eliminating illegal drug manufacture outweighs the slight infringement of any expectation of privacy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts of Appeals are divided on the legality of a warrantless installation of a beeper.

Moore</i>, 562 F.2d 106 (1977).  The court saw no merit in the Government counterargument that a lower standard was justified because the case involved a dangerous drug which the public would not want to go undetected.  The Sixth Circuit requires a warrant and probable cause for the installation of a beeper.  <i>United States v.

This case presents the very set of facts necessary to decide whether warrantless installation of such devices is permissible and, if so, whether reasonable suspicion is adequate justification.  Here DEA agents did not have probable cause to support warrantless installation.
