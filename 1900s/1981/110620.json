Investigation revealed information sufficient for the issuance of an arrest warrant for Archie Murphy.  On the evening of January 15, 1976, police went to an East Orange, N.J., apartment building to execute the arrest warrant for Murphy.  Upon arrival, one officer saw petitioner Edward Barry standing outside the building.

Petitioner was transferred to the Glen Ridge jail for overnight lodging.  In the early morning hours of January 16, Murphy made a statement incriminating himself and identifying petitioner as the driver of the getaway car.  At midday on January 16, after petitioner had been in custody for approximately 18 hours, he was taken from Glen Ridge jail to Montclair for questioning.  He was again given <i>Miranda</i> warnings and was told that his brother, Murphy, and another suspect had all confessed to the robbery and that he had been implicated.  He was also shown the weapons used in the robbery.

The court held that the intervening circumstances, including Murphy's confession and the recovery of the guns used in the robbery, severed any causal link between the illegal arrest and the subsequent confession and therefore the confession was properly admitted.

By focusing on the causal connection between an illegal arrest and a subsequent confession, <i>Brown</i> sought to implement the policies behind the use of the exclusionary rule to effectuate the Fourth Amendment.  <i>Dunaway v.

It identified three factors for determining whether it is necessary to exclude a confession obtained following an illegal arrest:  \"The temporal proximity of the arrest and the confession, the presence of intervening circumstances, . . . and, particularly, the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct are all relevant.\"  <i>Brown v.

That petitioner confessed after being held for 18 hours while the defendant in <i>Brown</i> confessed after only 2 hours is not dispositive.  As Justice STEVENS has observed:  \"The temporal relationship between the arrest and the confession may be an ambiguous factor.  If there are no relevant intervening circumstances, a prolonged detention may well be a more serious exploitation of an illegal arrest than a short one.\"  <i>Dunaway v.

But in <i>Brown</i>, as here, the police gave the defendant <i>Miranda</i> warnings, confronted him with the evidence they had against him, and this Court held the ensuing confession was inadmissible.  422 U.S., at 594, 95 S.Ct., at 2257.  The events between the illegal arrest and the confession were characterized in unequivocal terms:  \"Brown's first statement was separated from his illegal arrest by less than two hours, <i>and there was no intervening event of significance whatsoever.\"</i>  <i>Id.</i>, at 604, 95 S.Ct., at 2262 (emphasis added).  We have thus rejected the notion that the causal chain between an illegal arrest and a subsequent confession is broken by merely confronting the accused with evidence of his guilt in an effort to elicit an incriminating response.  Rather, \"some demonstrably effective break in the chain of events leading from the illegal arrest to the statement\" is required.  <i>Id.</i>, at 611, 95 S.Ct., at 2265 (POWELL, J., concurring in part).  See <i>Johnson v.

Illinois, supra</i>, 422 U.S., at 604, 95 S.Ct., at 2262.  See also <i>Wong Sun v.

I had thought that this is what the Court sought to prevent in <i>Brown</i> and <i>Dunaway</i>, since \"[h]ostility to seizures based on mere suspicion was a prime motivation for the adoption of the Fourth Amendment.\"  <i>Dunaway v. New York, supra</i>, 442 U.S., at 213, 99 S.Ct., at 2256.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third <i>Brown</i> factor to be considered is the purpose and flagrancy of the police conduct.  Although the police conduct here was not designed to cause fright and confusion as it was in <i>Brown</i>, 422 U.S., at 605, 95 S.Ct., at 2262, the police admittedly lacked probable cause to arrest petitioner, and the purpose of the arrest was to detain \"in the hope that something might turn up.\"  <i>Ibid.</i> This purpose is itself sufficient to exclude a confession, absent a sufficient intervening event.  <i>Dunaway v.

Rather, \"some demonstrably effective break in the chain of events leading from the illegal arrest to the statement\" is required.  <i>Id.</i>, at 611, 95 S.Ct., at 2265 (POWELL, J., concurring in part).  See <i>Johnson v. Louisiana</i>, 406 U.S. 356, 365, 92 S.Ct. 1620, 32 L.Ed.2d 152 (1972) (appearance before neutral magistrate and representation by counsel at lineup purged lineup of taint from illegal arrest), cited in <i>Brown v. Illinois, supra</i>, 422 U.S., at 604, 95 S.Ct., at 2262.  See also <i>Wong Sun v. United States, supra</i>, 371 U.S., at 491, 83 S.Ct., at 419 (actual release from detention prior to confession breaks chain).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In terms of the purposes of the exclusionary rule, allowing a confrontation such as occurred in this case to qualify as an intervening circumstance would permit the police to seize and detain any person without probable cause, secure in the knowledge that a confession later obtained by confronting the accused with evidence against him would be admissible.  I had thought that this is what the Court sought to prevent in <i>Brown</i> and <i>Dunaway</i>, since \"[h]ostility to seizures based on mere suspicion was a prime motivation for the adoption of the Fourth Amendment.\"  <i>Dunaway v. New York, supra</i>, 442 U.S., at 213, 99 S.Ct., at 2256.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third <i>Brown</i> factor to be considered is the purpose and flagrancy of the police conduct.  Although the police conduct here was not designed to cause fright and confusion as it was in <i>Brown</i>, 422 U.S., at 605, 95 S.Ct., at 2262, the police admittedly lacked probable cause to arrest petitioner, and the purpose of the arrest was to detain \"in the hope that something might turn up.\"  <i>Ibid.</i> This purpose is itself sufficient to exclude a confession, absent a sufficient intervening event.  <i>Dunaway v. New York, supra</i>, 442 U.S., at 218, 99 S.Ct., at 2259.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps the decision below should stand, but the tension between it and our own cases such as <i>Brown</i> is apparent, and it should either be reversed or our own decisions reconsidered and modified.  I would grant the petition for certiorari.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> See, <i>e. g., In re R.S.</i>, 93 Ill.App.3d 941, 49 Ill.Dec. 551, 418 N.E.2d 195 (1981);  <i>People v.

This is <i>a</i> factor, not the controlling factor . . . and thus must be considered with . . . 'the presence of intervening circumstances.' \"  3 W.
