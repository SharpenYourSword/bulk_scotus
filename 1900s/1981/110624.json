After a defendant is found guilty of a capital offense, an evidentiary hearing is held before the judge and the jury to determine the sentence.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the jury considers whether \"sufficient mitigating circumstances exist which outweigh the aggravating circumstances found to exist,\" and based on these considerations, \"whether the defendant should be sentenced to life imprisonment or death.\"  &#167;&#167; 921.141(2)(b) and (c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury's verdict is advisory only;  the actual sentence is imposed by the trial judge after he conducts his own review of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.

Petitioner was tried for the murder of a 67-year-old woman.  After the close of the evidence, the jury returned a verdict of guilty, but recommended a life sentence.  The trial judge rejected this recommendation and entered a judgment calling for the death sentence.  He found three statutory aggravating circumstances. First, because petitioner had recently pleaded guilty to an unrelated assault charge, he was a convicted felon.  See Fla.Stat. &#167; 921.141(5)(b) (1979). Second, the murder was \"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.\" &#167; 921.141(5)(h).  Third, the murder took place during the commission of a rape.  &#167; 921.141(5)(d).  The trial judge stated that these aggravating circumstances outweighed any mitigating circumstances.  He rejected evidence submitted by petitioner to show that at the time of the crime he was \"under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance,\" a statutory mitigating circumstance.  &#167; 921.141(6)(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the trial judge's decision to override the jury's advisory verdict.  <i>McCrae</i> (<i>sic</i>) <i>v. State</i>, 395 So.2d 1145 (1980).  It agreed that the guilty plea to the unrelated felony charge could be treated as a felony conviction, and thus constituted an aggravating circumstance under the death penalty statute.  It also agreed that the crime was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, and that it had taken place during the commission of a rape.  The Supreme Court reasoned that the jury must have decided to recommend life imprisonment because it believed that petitioner was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance at the time the crimes were committed. Like the trial judge, however, the State Supreme Court concluded that the evidence submitted by petitioner could not support a conclusion that this mitigating circumstance actually existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I am extremely troubled by the trial judge's decision to override the jury's advisory verdict, and by the Florida Supreme Court's affirmance of that decision.  A reasonable jury unquestionably could have concluded that the mitigating circumstances outweighed the aggravating circumstances. Petitioner offered substantial evidence in support of his claim that he acted under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance.  A psychiatrist, Dr. Clarence Schlit, testified that petitioner was subject to attacks when under emotional stress that prevented him from exercising a normal degree of restraint.  He further stated that although petitioner was not insane, he suffered from a chronic schizophrenic illness.  Dr. Schlit's testimony was confirmed by two court-appointed psychiatrists who examined petitioner to determine whether he was competent to stand trial.  Dr. Mordecai Haber observed that petitioner suffered from a disorder that contributed to an explosive personality.  He concluded that although petitioner was competent, he was too dangerous to be at liberty.  Dr. Thomas Haagland found that although petitioner had control of himself while sober, he released \"an underlying epileptic furor\" whenever he was intoxicated.  395 So.2d, at 1147-1148.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other evidence in the record lends support to petitioner's claim that he was emotionally disturbed at the time of the murder. Petitioner was confined in a psychiatric ward while in the United States Army.  Record 883.  Prior to trial he made at least three suicide attempts.  <i>Id.</i>, at 883, 884, 1005.  He frequently hears voices, and regards this as normal.  <i>Id.</i>, at 1006.  He suffers from \"organic brain syndrome with epilepsy.\"  <i>Id.</i>, at 1022.  These findings were confirmed by an electroencephalogram.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge and the Florida Supreme Court unfairly discounted this evidence.  They both emphasized that Dr. Schlit was unwilling to testify that it was a \"medical certainty\" that petitioner acted under the influence of extreme mental disturbance.  See 395 So.2d, at 1148.  This does not mean, however, that it was unreasonable for the jury to conclude, on the basis of all the evidence, that petitioner was emotionally disturbed at the time of the murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I also think it quite possible that the jury was not convinced that this was an \"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel\" murder within the meaning of the death penalty statute.  It is true that there was evidence suggesting that the victim was beaten before she died.  However, it was not possible to determine how quickly the victim died, or how much she suffered.  A reasonable jury could have found that the murder was not heinous.  The Florida Supreme Court has stated that the \"heinous, atrocious, or cruel\" standard applies only to those murders that are \"extremely wicked\" and \"shockingly evil,\" or \"designed to inflict a high degree of pain with utter indifference to, or even enjoyment of, the suffering of others.\"  <i>State v.
