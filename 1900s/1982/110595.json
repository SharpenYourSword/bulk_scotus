Appellants' reliance on <i>McLucas</i>, however, is misplaced.  In that case, the Court held that it had jurisdiction under &#167; 1252 to consider a direct appeal taken from a decision of a district court, even though the district court lacked jurisdiction because a three-judge district court should have been convened.  The Court noted that the purpose of &#167; 1252 was \"to afford immediate review in this Court in civil actions to which the United States or its officers are parties and thus will be bound by a holding of unconstitutionality.\"  421 U.S., at 31, 95 S.Ct., at 1371.  To effectuate this statutory purpose, the Court held that immediate review was available;  it was not necessary to vacate the decision of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings by a three-judge court.</p>\n        <p>In contrast, appellants do not contend that the District Court in the instant case lacked jurisdiction over this controversy.  Rather than pursue their right to immediate review in this Court, however, appellants obtained an intermediate decision from a Court of Appeals that had no power to consider this case.  In so doing, they failed to pursue timely the right to immediate review conferred by &#167; 1252.  The fact that the Court of Appeals also held that the Act was unconstitutional does not resurrect the right created by &#167; 1252 that had lapsed by appellants' action.  This case is the antithesis of <i>McLucas</i> ;  a recognition of jurisdiction would permit needless delay in securing Supreme Court review of a decision holding a federal statute unconstitutional.
