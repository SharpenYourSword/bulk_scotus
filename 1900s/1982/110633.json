This Court has not done so in Rule 12(b)(1), and Congress has implicitly expressed satisfaction with the current formulation of Rule 12(b)(1) by not seeking to add a dismissal-for-frivolousness standard&#8212;like that found in &#167; 1915(d)&#8212;in a manner similar to its revision of the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ", "id": 110633, "judges": "", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/110633/", "sha1": "f3873ba5e0cbb6ee810b64a26476c2288fc124d6", "source": "R", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T10:12:40"}
