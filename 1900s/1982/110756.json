Petitioners submitted the low bid for an advertised project but were disqualified under the School District plan as not being responsible. They brought this action claiming damages and asserting that the affirmative-action plan violated not only the Federal Constitution but also state law. The Court of Appeals affirmed a judgment of the District Court upholding the plan on constitutional grounds. 662 F. 2d 550 (1981). Although the Court of Appeals acknowledged that under one of its prior decisions, the plan at issue might be invalid under state law, it declined to decide the state-law question since it was a sensitive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*595</span> matter and petitioners could present it to the state courts.</p>\n<p>If the affirmative-action plan is invalid under state law, the Court of Appeals need not have reached the federal constitutional issue.
