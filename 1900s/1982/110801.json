A Virginia trial court awarded petitioner's ex-wife custody of their 3-year old son and ordered petitioner to pay child support.  Petitioner then brought this action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 against the trial judge, the state governor, and the state attorney general.  His complaint sought monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief, premised on allegations that the custody and support award violated the First, Fifth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments.

Harris</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108263\"><a href=\"/opinion/108263/younger-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971).  First, this Court has never applied the <i>Younger</i> doctrine to a case where the State was not a party to the pending state proceedings.  <i>Younger</i> and its early progeny were criminal proceedings, in which, of course, the State is always a party.  In <i>Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109216\"><a href=\"/opinion/109216/huffman-v-pursue-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></a></span>, 95 S.Ct. 1200, 43 L.Ed.2d 482 (1975), the initial application of <i>Younger</i> to a civil proceeding, the Court relied heavily on the State's direct participation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"<i>Younger</i>, however, also rests upon the traditional reluctance      of courts of equity, even within a unitary system, to interfere with a criminal prosecution.  Strictly speaking,      this element of <i>Younger</i> is not available to mandate federal      restraint in civil cases.  But whatever may be the weight      attached to this factor in civil litigation involving private      parties, we deal here with a state proceeding which in      important respects is more akin to a criminal proceeding than      are most civil cases.  The State is a party to the Court of      Common Pleas proceeding, and the proceeding is both in aid of      and closely related to criminal statutes. . . .\"  <i>Id.</i>, at      604, 95 S.Ct. at 1208.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, subsequent extensions of <i>Younger</i> in the civil context have occurred only when the State was directly involved in a pending state proceeding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The Fourth Circuit's invocation of <i>Younger</i> in this case, a \"civil litigation involving private parties,\" represents a substantial broadening of the doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Court of Appeals held that deference was justified despite the fact that there was no on-going or pending state proceedings in the usual sense.  Dismissal of the federal action was deemed appropriate because child custody orders in Virginia are subject to modification at any time and petitioner could follow that avenue in order to raise his constitutional claims.  It is clear that, under the Court of Appeals reasoning, custody proceedings would never be final and petitioner would be forced to attempt to reopen state proceedings before receiving a hearing in federal court on any constitutional grounds.  None of our <i>Younger</i> decisions contemplates this result, which, in effect, imposes an exhaustion requirement upon petitioner before he may bring a &#167; 1983 suit in federal court.  Assertion of a federal claim under &#167; 1983, as a general matter, need not be preceded by an attempt to vindicate that claim in state court.  <i>McNeese v.

Although there are recognized exceptions when \"strands of local law are woven into the case\" whose resolution should precede consideration by a federal court, <i>id.</i>, at 673, 83 S.Ct., at 1436, this is not suggested to be such a case.
