But the Court of Appeals also recognized that the most recently decided of these cases, Montana v. United States, supra, cited Wheeler with complete approval. In Montana, we went on to say:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Thus, in addition to the power to punish tribal offenders,      the Indian tribes retain their inherent power to determine      tribal membership, to regulate domestic relations among      members, and to prescribe rules of inheritance for members.      (Citation omitted). But exercise of tribal power beyond what      is necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control      internal relations is inconsistent with the dependent status      of the tribes, and so cannot survive without express      congressional delegation. (Citations omitted). Since      regulation of hunting and fishing by non-members of a tribe      on lands no longer owned by the tribe bears no clear      relationship to tribal self-government or internal relations,      the general principles of retained inherent sovereignty did      not authorize the Crow Tribe to adopt Resolution No. 74-05.\"      Montana v.

The correctness of that conclusion obviously depends upon the Court of Appeals' resolution of the \"ownership\" issue; if upon review of this latter determination we were to decide that the southern half of the Flathead Lake passed to the State of Montana under our decision in Montana v.

But exercise of tribal power beyond what      is necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control      internal relations is inconsistent with the dependent status      of the tribes, and so cannot survive without express      congressional delegation. (Citations omitted). Since      regulation of hunting and fishing by non-members of a tribe      on lands no longer owned by the tribe bears no clear      relationship to tribal self-government or internal relations,      the general principles of retained inherent sovereignty did      not authorize the Crow Tribe to adopt Resolution No. 74-05.\"      Montana v. United States, 450 U.S., at 564-565, 101 S.Ct., at      1257-58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals felt that even under the more recently expressed doctrines re-affirmed in Montana, the ordinance regulating non-Indian lands abutting Flathead Lake was authorized because the southern half of the lake, in its view, was owned by the United States in trust for the Tribe. The correctness of that conclusion obviously depends upon the Court of Appeals' resolution of the \"ownership\" issue; if upon review of this latter determination we were to decide that the southern half of the Flathead Lake passed to the State of Montana under our decision in Montana v. United States, the Court of Appeals' justification for its decision of the \"regulatory\" issue would likewise fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"ownership\" and \"regulatory\" issues present important questions having ramifications throughout the many western states within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. I would grant certiorari to review that court's decision of both issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
