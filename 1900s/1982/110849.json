In Schwimmer v. Sony Corp. of America, it was alleged that Sony, in conspiracy with certain retailers, terminated Schwimmer's dealership because it had sold Sony products to other dealers at lower than normal prices. In Venture Technology, Inc. v. National Fuel Gas Distribution Corp., the complaint was that respondent National Fuel Gas had conspired to prevent Venture Technology from entering the western New York gas production business.

This view of the evidence necessary to create a jury question under the Sherman Act is shared by the Third Circuit. Edward J. Sweeney &amp; Sons v. Texaco, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"385719\"><a href=\"/opinion/385719/edward-j-sweeney-sons-inc-and-mission-gas-oil-comp/\"><span class=\"volume\">637</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span> (1980), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">911</span></span>, 101 S.Ct. 1981, 68 L.Ed.2d 300 (1981). The Seventh and Eight Circuits, however, clearly reject this position. Spray-Rite Service Corp. v.

These cases indicate that it is the Second Circuit's practice to examine all of the evidence in a manner most favorable to the nonmoving party.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This is also the position of at least the Fifth and Seventh Circuits. Boeing Co. v. Shipman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"284955\"><a href=\"/opinion/284955/the-boeing-company-v-daniel-c-shipman/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span>, 374-375 (CA5 1969); Panter v.

In the Eighth Circuit, however, it appears that only evidence which supports the verdict winner is to be considered. Simpson v. Skelly Oil Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"274451\"><a href=\"/opinion/274451/jerry-simpson-v-skelly-oil-company-a-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span> (CA8 1967). The First and Third Circuits follow a middle ground: the reviewing court may consider uncontradicted, unimpeached evidence from disinterested witnesses. Layne v. Vinzant, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"393677\"><a href=\"/opinion/393677/robert-m-layne-v-douglas-vinzant-frank-hall-and-ch/\"><span class=\"volume\">657</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span>, 472 (CA1 1981); Inventive Music Ltd. v.

Thus, the federal courts of appeals follow three different approaches to determining whether evidence is sufficient to create a jury issue. See 9 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 2529, at 572. Because the scope of review will often be influential, if not dispositive, of a motion for judgment n.o.v., this disagreement among the federal courts of appeals is of far more than academic interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For both these reasons, I would grant the petitions for certiorari.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The opinion for the Seventh Circuit in Spray-Rite Service Corp. v.
