The motion was denied on July 7, 1981.  For some reason, however, notice of the denial from the Clerk of the District Court was not received by either petitioner or the United States Attorney.  Petitioner&#8212;who was incarcerated the entire time first learned of it by happenstance in September 1981.  He promptly requested leave from the District Court to appeal out of time, and that Court, after due investigation of the circumstances, granted his request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government explicitly refused to contest the propriety of the appeal before the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals <i>sua sponte</i> dismissed the appeal, holding that district courts may not grant leave to appeal after the maximum extension period has passed.  See Fed.R.App.P. 4(b).  The court implied that the rigidity of Rule 4(b) could not be set aside even though this petitioner was ignorant, through no fault of his own, of the denial of his Rule 35 motion throughout the period of an allowable extension.  Cf.

Nevertheless, if Rules 4(b) and 49(c) were truly the last word in defining petitioner's opportunity to appeal under our federal system of procedure, I would have serious doubts about the constitutionality of that system of procedure.  Simply put, the application of these Rules to penalize an uncounselled and incarcerated criminal defendant for a clerical error that was none of his doing and of which he had no knowledge would seem to me not only unduly harsh but resoundingly unjust.

The Ninth Circuit itself has recognized that district courts could employ this procedure under the proper circumstances, although it has not, as best as I can tell, ever actually found such circumstances to have been shown.  See <i>Rodgers v. Watt,</i> 680 F.2d 1295, 1298 (1982);  <i>Kramer v. American Postal Workers Union,</i> 556 F.2d 929 (1977).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, which has taken over most of the function of the writ of <i>coram nobis</i> in federal criminal procedure, only applies to collateral attacks on underlying sentences, and could not be employed to vacate and reenter an order denying a motion under Rule 35.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> In the alternative, the Court of Appeals might have exercised its own residual appellate jurisdiction and remanded the matter to the District Court to allow it to vacate and reenter the order from which petitioner sought appeal.  Cf. <i>Moody v. Flowers,</i> 387 U.S. 97, 104, 87 S.Ct. 1544, 1549, 18 L.Ed.2d 643 (1967); <i>Gully v. Interstate Natural Gas Co.,</i> 292 U.S. 16, 18-19, 54 S.Ct. 565, 566-67, 78 L.Ed. 1088 (1934).  Neither of these approaches could possibly have prejudiced the government, since it has consistently declined to contest the jurisdictional basis of petitioner's appeal.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> I suppose also that a holding is possible that, although <i>coram nobis</i> is an appropriate vehicle for mitigating the harshness of Rule 4(b), petitioner's circumstances are not sufficiently \"extraordinary\" for him to merit such relief.  In that event, what constitutional issues arise in the case will at least be significantly more focused.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
