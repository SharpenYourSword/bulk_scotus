But since a letterbox is not traditionally such a 'public      forum' the elaborate analysis engaged in by the District      Court was, we think, unnecessary.  To be sure, if a      governmental regulation is based on the content of the speech      or the message, that action must be scrutinized more      carefully to ensure that communication has not been      prohibited 'merely because public officials disapprove the      speaker's view.'  <i>Consolidated Edison Co. v.

In the Fall of 1978, approximately 45 members of respondents' organization invaded the hospital premises without permission, and proceeded to hold a press conference in the front lobby of Parkland.
