The sentencer has a different role.  The sentencer's duty is to determine in the first instance whether a death sentence is warranted for a particular defendant.  That determination can only be made on the basis of the evidence that the judge has heard with respect to that defendant, and, under the Florida procedure, on the recommendation made by the jury that heard that evidence.

If this is true, the fault lies in the capital sentencing scheme itself.  The remedy is not to deny a defendant the individualized consideration to which he is entitled, but to review the sentences that are actually imposed and to set aside death sentences in those cases that cannot be distinguished from cases in which life sentences were imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Petitioner had no history of prior criminal activity.  In addition, a clinical psychologist testified that petitioner did not have a violent nature, but had \"basically a dependent personality.\"  The psychologist testified that petitioner had come under the negative influence of Jent but would respond positively to the influence of \"a stronger person [who] is a favorable, community oriented individual.\"  The trial judge gave no weight to this testimony.  If the judge who sentenced petitioner had not also sentenced Jent, or if the jury had recommended life imprisonment for Jent, the judge may well have been willing to take this testimony into account.</p>\n        <p>The court also declined to admit additional testimony offered by the clinical psychologist regarding petitioner's capacity for rehabilitation.  The court's exclusion of such mitigating evidence may itself have been a violation of due process.  The sentencer may \"not be precluded from considering, <i>as a mitigating factor,</i> any aspect of a defendant's character or record . . . that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\" <i>Lockett v.
