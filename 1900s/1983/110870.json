The Confortes filed tax returns for the years in question stating a \"net income,\" but without disclosing their gross income and deductions;  they claimed these details would be incriminating.  Based on projections of income and expenses, the IRS determined that the Confortes had a greater tax liability than their \"net income\" revealed.</p>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Confortes petitioned to the Tax Court for a redetermination.  That court sustained the calculations made by the IRS.  74 T.C. 1160 (1980).  Pursuant to 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7482 (1976 &amp; Supp.IV 1980), the Confortes appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  692 F.2d 587 (1982).  On November 5, 1982, the Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part as to Mrs. Conforte.  Applicant's appeal, however, was dismissed.  Applicant seeks a stay of that dismissal.</p>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court of Appeals found that applicant is a fugitive from justice for convictions on four counts of willfully attempting to evade federal employment taxes.  See <i>United States v. Conforte,</i> 624 F.2d 869 (9th Cir.1980).  Relying on this Court's decision in <i>Molinaro v. New Jersey,</i> 396 U.S. 365, 90 S.Ct. 498, 24 L.Ed.2d 586 (1970) (per curiam), the court held that as a fugitive from justice applicant should not be allowed to prosecute an appeal in the federal courts.</p>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court rejected applicant's argument that <i>Molinaro</i> only applies to appeals from criminal convictions.  The court noted that \"the rule should apply with greater force in civil cases where an individual's liberty is not at stake,\" 692 F.2d, at 589, and cited a series of cases from the Courts of Appeals so holding. See <i>Doyle v. Department of Justice,</i> 668 F.2d 1365 (CADC 1981) (<i>per curiam</i> ), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 102 S.Ct. 1636, 71 L.Ed.2d 870 (1982);  <i>Broadway v. City of Montgomery,</i> 530 F.2d 657 (CA5 1976);  <i>United States v. Commanding Officer,</i> 496 F.2d 324 (CA1 1974).  The court also said it need not determine whether <i>Molinaro</i> would apply where the criminal conviction and the civil appeal are unrelated because here the issues of the two cases \"are each related components of a general tax evasion scheme.\"  692 F.2d, at 590.  Finally, relying on its own decisions in <i>United States v. Wood,</i> 550 F.2d 435 (9th Cir.1976), and <i>Johnson v. Laird,</i> 432 F.2d 77 (9th Cir.1970), the court held that <i>Molinaro</i> is not limited to discretionary appeals.</p>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court of Appeals did not leave applicant without recourse.  The court ruled that \"[i]f within 56 days he submits himself to the jurisdiction of the District Court of Nevada [the court from which he is a fugitive], he may move to reinstate his appeal.\"  692 F.2d, at 590.  With a three day extension because of the New Year's Eve holiday, the 56 days expired on January 3, 1982.  On the same day applicant filed in this Court for a stay of the Court of Appeals decision pending his filing of a petition for certiorari and our disposition of that petition.</p>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applicant argues that a stay should be granted because \"the 56 day limitation will expire before the application for a writ of certiorari can be completed and filed.\"  He maintains that should this Court deny his yet-to-be filed petition for certiorari he desires to have time remaining to comply with the Court of Appeals' directive.  The 56 days expired on the day applicant filed for this stay.  Except in extreme circumstances the Court generally is unable to provide same-day-service.  While it might be within our jurisdiction to grant a stay retroactively, an applicant detracts from the urgency of his situation where he makes a last minute claim and offers no explanation for his procrastination.</p>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applicant may be injured if a stay does not issue.  Assuming he files a petition for certiorari, unless we grant that petition and reverse the lower court the running of the 56 days will bar applicant from reinstating his appeal by surrendering to the authorities.  A stay is appropriate, however, only where there is a reasonable possibility that four justices of this Court will vote to grant certiorari.  See <i>Houchins v. KQED, Inc.,</i> 429 U.S. 1341, 1344, 97 S.Ct. 773, 774, 50 L.Ed.2d 733 (1977) (REHNQUIST, J., in chambers);  <i>Graves v. Barnes,</i> 405 U.S. 1201, 1203, 92 S.Ct. 752, 753, 30 L.Ed.2d 769 (1972) (POWELL, J., in chambers).

See also <i>Smith v. United States,</i> 94 U.S. 97, 24 L.Ed. 32 (1876).
