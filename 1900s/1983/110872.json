Respondents are various school and state officials.  The application was filed here on February 2.

At the time, an Alabama statute provided for a one-minute period of silence \"for meditation or voluntary prayer\" at the commencement of each day's classes in the public elementary schools.  Ala.Code &#167; 16-1-20.1 (Supp.1982).

It again recognized that the prayers at issue, given in public school classes and led by teachers, were violative of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment as that clause has been construed by this Court.
