The Board found that the proposed broadening \"will reduce the consumption of energy resources, will offer potential cost savings and improved efficiency, will enable applicant to provide full service to a broader range of shippers and in rural communities, and will be consistent with the [transportation policies of the Act].\"  The Commission denied internal appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Steere Tank Lines, one of the objecting carriers, then challenged the Commission's action in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, arguing that the Commission's guidelines were not valid under the Act.

The Fifth Circuit maintained that the Commission's guidelines fail to account for the Motor Carrier Act's mandate that every carrier be \"fit, willing, and able to provide the transportation to be authorized by the certificate.\"  49 U.S.C. &#167; 10922(a)(1).

In ruling upon such restriction-removal applications, the Commission is directed by the Act to consider \"the impact of the proposed restriction removal upon the consumption of energy resources, potential cost savings and improved efficiency, and the transportation policy set forth in [the Act]\" and to \"give special consideration to providing and maintaining service to small and rural communities and small shippers.\"  49 U.S.C. &#167; 10922(h)(2). The Act does not apply the \"fit, willing, and able\" requirement to applications for removal of service restrictions;  this requirement is expressly applicable only to carriers seeking a new certificate.  49 U.S.C. &#167; 10922(b)(1)(A).

The Commission itself is in the best position to speak to this matter.  The Commission reports that its Restriction Removal Board which regularly processed applications for expanded authority has been closed down due to a lack of applications being filed.
