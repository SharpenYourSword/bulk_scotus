The respondents in <i>Pearce</i> had obtained reversal of their criminal convictions on federal constitutional grounds.  They were retried, convicted, and then given sentences that were up to two and a half times as long as their original sentences.  This Court held that the harsher sentences suggested that the states were punishing criminal defendants for exercising their federal constitutional rights.  We stated that the sentencing authority could only impose longer sentences if it explained its reasons on the record.  <i>Blackledge</i> extended <i>Pearce</i> to establish a presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness in cases where prosecutors press more serious charges on defendants who obtain reversals of their convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think the decision below is quite problematic.  First, in this case, unlike <i>Pearce</i> and <i>Blackledge,</i> there is a fully credible alternative explanation for the trial judge's behavior, one that <i>was credited</i> by the state court.  The Supreme Judicial Court construed the judge's comments simply to inform Longval of the facts of life in his courtroom.  This Court has often stressed the importance of providing criminal defendants with full information. For example, in <i>Boykin v. Alabama,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107951\"><a href=\"/opinion/107951/boykin-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span>, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969), we reversed a conviction on a guilty plea because we were not certain that the defendant had \"a full understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 244, 89 S.Ct., at 1712.  Surely defendants should be as well informed of the possible consequences of a not-guilty plea. If this judge routinely handed out long sentences after convictions of serious crimes, it would be in Longval's interest to know that;  certainly the prosecutor with whom Longval and his counsel had engaged in plea bargaining negotiations already knew the judge's sentencing habits.  It seems incongruous at best to want defendants to be fully informed and then to adopt a <i>per se</i> rule condemning judges who provide them with information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, in <i>Goodwin, supra,</i> we held that the <i>Pearce-Blackledge</i> presumption does not apply where a prosecutor presses more serious charges in a plea bargaining situation.  The rationale of the decision is that vindictiveness is less likely during pre-trial plea bargaining than after a trial and an appeal.  The Court of Appeals sought to distinguish <i>Goodwin</i> on the ground that this case involves a judge rather than a prosecutor, and judges are expected to be impartial.  I believe the Good<i>win</i> rationale is fully applicable in this case.  If anything, the impartial position of the judge suggests that we should be more reluctant to apply a presumption of vindictiveness to judges than to prosecutors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guilty pleas result from discussions and negotiations between opposing advocates and require them to predict the probability of conviction and the severity of the sentence that is likely to be imposed.  It is at least arguable that this process is made fairer when the accused has complete information concerning the sentence he is likely to receive.  Because I doubt whether a <i>per se</i> presumption of judicial vindictiveness is warranted in cases such as this, I would grant certiorari.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
