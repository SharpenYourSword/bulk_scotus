The State indicated that it would have no objection to Rich's testifying if the case were continued for a few days, so that an investigation of Rich could be conducted.  The trial court declined to order a continuance;  instead, it ordered that Rich not be permitted to testify.  The court did not find that petitioner's violation of Rule 741 was deliberate;  rather, it found that petitioner had not been \"diligent\" and \"hadn't made any real effort, except yesterday, to locate this witness.\"  App. to Petn. for Cert. A-90&#8212;A-91.  The court's ruling severely prejudiced petitioner, since alibi was his only defense, and Rich was his only alibi witness.
