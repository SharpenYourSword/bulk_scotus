He was arrested in Los Angeles on May 7, 1980 while attempting to board a nonstop flight to Lima, Peru.  Prior to the scheduled departure time, a Customs Official had announced that anyone taking more than $5,000 currency out of the country was required to file a report with the Customs Service.  When stopped on the boarding ramp, petitioner acknowledged that he had heard the announcement but denied that he was carrying more than $5,000.  He repeated this denial during subsequent questioning, but a search of his person and belongings revealed approximately $29,000 in cash as well as a variety of narcotics paraphernalia.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, applicant was convicted of attempted importation of narcotics;  making false statements to a government official, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001;  and failing to file a report in connection with the transportation of more than $5,000 outside the United States, in violation of 31 U.S.C. &#167; 1101.  He was sentenced to concurrent five-year terms and fined $5,000 each on the first two counts.  He received a consecutive one-year term and a $5,000 fine on the third count.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applicant was freed on bond pending appeal.  The Court of Appeals, by a divided vote, affirmed his conviction in all respects, and this application followed.  For the reasons explained below, the application is denied.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standards to be applied are well-established. Applications for bail to this Court are granted only in extraordinary circumstances, especially where, as here, \"the lower court refused to stay its order pending appeal.\"   <i>Graves v.

First, he argues that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001 does not apply to his statements at all because those statements were oral, unsworn, exculpatory and immaterial.  A fair reading of the statute, however, brings applicant's false statements to the Customs Official squarely within the prohibition of &#167; 1001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> Second, petitioner contends that a conviction under both 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001 and 31 U.S.C. &#167; 1101 violates the Double Jeopardy Clause. But under the test established in <i>Blockburger v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></span>, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed.2d 306 (1932), cumulative punishments under separate statutes are permitted provided only that each statute requires proof of a fact not required by the other.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001 requires a finding that applicant misled a government official by material false statements.  31 U.S.C. &#167; 1101 requires a different finding that applicant failed to file the required currency reporting form.  Thus, the <i>Blockburger</i> test is satisfied.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner also claims that the evidence taken from his person and his luggage was the fruit of unconstitutional searches and should have been suppressed.  But see, <i>United States v.
