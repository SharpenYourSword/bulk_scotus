City of Boston, et al.,</i> 568 F.Supp. 1012.  That judgment found unconstitutional a new electoral districting plan adopted by the Boston City Council and approved by the Mayor of Boston for the election by district of members of the City Council and the School Committee, and enjoined the defendants from conducting preliminary or final elections under the provisions of the plan. On August 2, 1983, the District Court permitted the Attorney General to intervene in this matter and denied his motions to stay the court's judgment pending appeal and for relief from judgment. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, on August 5, 1983, also denied the Attorney General's request for a stay, and this application followed.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general principles that guide my consideration as a Circuit Justice of this application are well-settled:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Relief from a single Justice is appropriate only in those      extraordinary cases where the applicant is able to rebut the      presumption that the decisions below&#8212;both on the merits and      on the proper interim disposition of the case&#8212;are correct.      In a case like the present one, this can be accomplished only      if a four-part showing is made.  First, it must be      established that there is a 'reasonable probability' that      four Justices will consider the issue sufficiently      meritorious to grant certiorari or to note probable      jurisdiction.  Second, the applicant must persuade [the      Circuit Justice] that there is a fair prospect that a      majority of the Court will conclude that the decision below      was erroneous.  While related to the first inquiry, this      question may involve somewhat different considerations,      especially in cases presented on direct appeal.  Third, there      must be a demonstration that irreparable harm is likely to      result from the denial of a stay.
