In its opinion, the Court of Appeals stated that the petition raised substantial issues that warranted review.  The Attorney General filed an application with me as Circuit Justice requesting that I dissolve and vacate the stay.

Again I cannot say that the court abused its discretion in staying Smith's execution.  The Court of Appeals is in a better position to determine the merits of Smith's request for rehearing and how much time it needs adequately to consider his claims.  In the past, the Court of Appeals has addressed this case in an expeditious manner, consistent with our opinion in <i>Barefoot v. Estelle,</i> --- U.S. ----, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983).  I have no reason to believe that the court will not expedite consideration of Smith's suggestion for rehearing.

Apart from rehearings this case has now been reviewed sixteen times by state and federal courts.  Few cases have received more repetitive consideration than this one.  I cannot say whether the judicial process has been abused deliberately.  Certainly our dual state and federal process, as presently structured by law, invites the years of repetitious litigation experienced in this case.
