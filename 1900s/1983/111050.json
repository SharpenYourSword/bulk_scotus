In October 1983, applicant filed his second petition for post-conviction relief in state court.  The denial of that relief was affirmed on appeal, <i>Sullivan v. State,</i> --- So.2d ---- (Fla. November 21, 1983), and applicant filed a second petition for writ of habeas corpus in the federal court.  Following a hearing, the District Court declined to issue the writ, and refused to issue a stay of execution or a certificate of probable cause to appeal.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, with one judge dissenting in part.  That court issued a temporary stay in order to allow a vote on applicant's suggestion for rehearing <i>en banc.</i>  That stay was lifted when the suggestion was denied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This application for a stay pending completion of the rehearing vote was presented to Justice POWELL as Circuit Justice on November 28, 1983.

His case was one of the earliest to be decided under Florida's current death penalty statute.  The state supreme court has used it as a reference point, comparing all subsequent capital cases to applicant's case to ensure proportionality.

Counsel for applicant, who is white, present voluminous statistics that they say support the claim of discriminatory application of the death sentence.  Although some of the statistics are relatively new, many of the studies were conducted years ago and were available to applicant long before he filed his most recent state and federal habeas petitions.  The Florida Supreme Court and both the federal District Court and the Eleventh Circuit have considered this data and determined in written opinions that it is insufficient to show that the Florida system is unconstitutionally discriminatory.

In particular, Sullivan alleges that application of the Florida death penalty statute violates the Equal Protection Clause because it discriminates against capital defendants solely on the basis of their race and the race of their victims.  For support, Sullivan has proffered numerous scholarly studies, several of which are yet to be published, that provide statistical evidence to substantiate his claim.  Although the Court has avoided ruling on similar claims in the past, and continues to avoid the issue by its decision tonight, the claim is clearly deserving of further consideration.  Indeed, as the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has recognized in a similar case, \"the merits of this allegation cannot be assessed without a more detailed consideration of the evidence proffered\" and therefore the applicant \"is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the merits of the claim as a matter of law.\"  <i>Spencer v.

The haste with which the Court has proceeded in this case means not only that Sullivan's claim has not received the thoughtful consideration to which it is entitled, but also that the Court has once again rushed to judgment, apparently eager to reach a fatal conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In addition, applicant was a plaintiff in an action attacking the Florida executive clemency procedure.

S. 153, 227 (1976) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), I would grant the application and stay the execution of applicant Sullivan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Even if I accepted the prevailing view that the death penalty may constitutionally be imposed under certain circumstances, I would grant the application because Sullivan has raised a substantial claim concerning the constitutionality of his death sentence. In particular, Sullivan alleges that application of the Florida death penalty statute violates the Equal Protection Clause because it discriminates against capital defendants solely on the basis of their race and the race of their victims. For support, Sullivan has proffered numerous scholarly studies, several of which are yet to be published, that provide statistical evidence to substantiate his claim. Although the Court has avoided ruling on similar claims in the past, and continues to avoid the issue by its decision tonight, the claim is clearly deserving of further consideration. Indeed, as the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has recognized in a similar case, \"the merits of this allegation cannot be assessed without a more detailed consideration of the evidence proffered\" and therefore the applicant \"is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the merits of the claim as a matter of law.\" <i>Spencer</i> v. <i>Zant,</i> 715 F. 2d 1562, 1582-1583 (1983). See <i>Townsend</i> v. <i>Sain,</i> 372 U. S. 293 (1963).</p>\n<p>I see no reason to depart from that sensible approach in this case. In fact, the Court has had only 24 hours to examine the voluminous stay application and exhibits that have been filed on Sullivan's behalf. The haste with which the Court has proceeded in this case means not only that Sullivan's claim has not received the thoughtful consideration to which it is entitled, but also that the Court has once again rushed to judgment, apparently eager to reach a fatal conclusion.</p>\n<p>I dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  In addition, applicant was a plaintiff in an action attacking the Florida executive-clemency procedure. See <i>Sullivan</i> v. <i>Askew,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1933750\"><a href=\"/opinion/1933750/sullivan-v-askew/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span> (Fla.), cert. denied, 434 U. S. 878 (1977).</p>\n<p>[2]  Applicant's case has been considered by at least 10 state and federal courts other than this one, and twice before by this Court.</p>\n<p>[3]  Judge Anderson dissented in the court below on the ground that the statistics presented in this case were equal in quality to those presented with respect to Georgia's death penalty statute in <i>Spencer</i> v. <i>Zant,</i> 715 F. 2d 1562, 1578-1583 (CA11 1983). In that case and the companion case of <i>Ross</i> v. <i>Hopper,</i> 716 F. 2d 1528, 1539 (CA11 1983), the Eleventh Circuit remanded the statistical claim to the District Court for a hearing. This case is different from those because in this case both of the lower courts, as well as this Court, have had the opportunity to consider the statistics. In <i>Spencer,</i> the Eleventh Circuit found it \"unlikely that the district court could have adequately analyzed the [statistical] evidence insofar as it was not then available except by live testimony.\" 715 F. 2d, at 1582. The court therefore remanded to the District Court to consider the evidence. <i>Ross</i> was treated identically because it had been consolidated with <i>Spencer</i> in the District Court. <i>Ross, supra,</i> at 1539.</p>\n\n</div>", "id": 111050, "judges": "Per Curiam", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/111050/", "sha1": "d61936fb81af46639403eb381ebd4a1042f8945f", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": "1983-010", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T10:12:53"}
