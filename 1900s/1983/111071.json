At this proceeding, the state and the defendant are permitted to present evidence in support of arguments for and against a sentence of death.  At the conclusion of these presentations, the court submits to the jury three questions:  (1) whether the conduct of the defendant that caused the death of the deceased was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased or another would result;  (2) whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society;  and (3) if raised by the evidence, whether the conduct of the defendant in killing the deceased was unreasonable in response to the provocation, if any, by the deceased.  If the jury finds that the state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the answer to each of the three questions is yes, the court imposes the death sentence.  If the jury finds that the answer to any question is no, the court imposes a sentence of life imprisonment.
