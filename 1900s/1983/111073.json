Ohio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109935\"><a href=\"/opinion/109935/lockett-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978), and <i>Eddings v.

Under Illinois statute, once a sentencing jury finds a statutorily-defined aggravating factor to exist, the jury proceeds to consider aggravating and mitigating factors.  \"If the jury determines unanimously that there are no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude the imposition of the death sentence, the court shall sentence the defendant to death.\"  Ill.Rev.Stat., ch. 38, &#167; 9-1(g) (West Supp.1982).  At the sentencing trial in this case, the trial judge instructed the jury on how to evaluate mitigating evidence:  \"[Y]ou go out and determine whether or not this evidence has taken away the [aggravating] factors, mitigated the factors so that you might say no, we don't want to vote for the death penalty.\"  See <i>People v. Jones,</i> 94 Ill.2d 275, 302, 68 Ill.Dec. 903, 916, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2190276\"><a href=\"/opinion/2190276/people-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span>, 174 (1982) (Simon, J., dissenting).  Notwithstanding other portions of the trial court's instructions, this instruction coupled with the Illinois statute's ambiguous reference to \"preclud[ing] the imposition of the death sentence\" may well have led the sentencing jury to conduct its deliberation under the assumption that petitioner had the burden of proving that the death penalty was inappropriate in his particular case.  Since I do not understand this Court's precedents to permit the placing of such a burden on a defendant, I would grant the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
