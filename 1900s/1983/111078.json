Before the trial commenced, the District Court ruled that such statements would be admitted conditionally subject to a later demonstration of their admissibility by a preponderance of the evidence under the procedure approved by the Sixth Circuit in <i>United States v. Vinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"370192\"><a href=\"/opinion/370192/united-states-v-charles-vinson-united-states-of-am/\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span>, 153 (1979), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1074</span></span>, 100 S.Ct. 1020, 62 L.Ed.2d 756 and <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">904</span></span>, 100 S.Ct. 1080, 63 L.Ed.2d 319 (1980). At the close of the Government's case, petitioner moved to strike the co-conspirators' statements that had been admitted over his continuing objection.  In his view, the Government had failed to demonstrate that (1) a conspiracy existed, (2) petitioner was a member of the conspiracy, and (3) the hearsay statements were made in the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.  See <i>id.,</i> at 152.  The District Court denied petitioner's motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, petitioner contended that the District Court had abused its discretion in considering the statements themselves in determining whether the Government had satisfied the prerequisites to admission of those statements.  Without commenting on the sufficiency of the Government's independent evidence, the Court of Appeals simply reaffirmed its previous holdings that Fed.Rule Evid. 104(a) had modified prior law to the contrary so as to authorize the consideration of challenged hearsay statements in deciding the preliminary question of admissibility, see, <i>e.g., United States v.

Those courts have, almost without exception, admitted statements of co-conspirators only upon a showing by a preponderance of independent evidence that a conspiracy existed in which the declarant and the defendant were both members and that the challenged statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy.
