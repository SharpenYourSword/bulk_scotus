It is a doubt which is reasonable and excludes a doubt which is unreasonable.  It is such a doubt as for the existence of which a reasonable person can give or suggest a good and sufficient reason.  It does not mean a trivial or a frivolous or a fanciful doubt nor one which can be readily or easily explained away, but rather such a strong and abiding conviction as still remains after careful consideration of all the facts and arguments against it and would cause a fair-minded person to refrain from acting in regard to some transaction of importance and seriousness equal to this case.\"  570 F.2d, at 23, n. 1.</p>\n        <p>Although the trial court in <i>Dunn,</i> unlike the Court at petitioner's trial, likened reasonable doubt to the degree of uncertainty that would cause a prudent person to hesitate before making an important personal decision, the First Circuit made clear in its decision that the constitutionally defective portion of the <i>Dunn</i> instruction was the equation of a reasonable doubt to a substantial and articulable doubt.   <i>Id.,</i> at 24-25.  In these two respects, the <i>Dunn</i> instruction and the instruction given at petitioner's trial are identical.</p>\n        <p>As the instruction in petitioner's case equated reasonable doubt with \"a strong and well-founded doubt,\" the trial court in <i>Dunn</i> defined reasonable doubt to be \"a strong and abiding conviction.\" Where petitioner's instruction likened a reasonable doubt to \"a doubt for which you can give a reason,\" the <i>Dunn</i> instruction referred to a reasonable doubt as \"a doubt as for the existance of which a reasonable person can give or suggest a good and sufficient reason.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> See, <i>e.g., State v.
