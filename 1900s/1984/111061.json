Pursuant to these provisions, a Department of Labor official, upon entering appellee motel and restaurant, served an administrative subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> on one of appellee's employees, directing the employee to appear at the area Wage and Hour Office with certain payroll and sales records. Appellee refused to comply with the subpoena and sought declaratory and injunctive relief in Federal District Court, claiming that the subpoena constituted an unlawful search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  The District Court held that, although the Secretary had complied with the applicable FLSA provisions in issuing the subpoena, enforcement of the subpoena would violate the Fourth Amendment because the Secretary had not previously obtained a judicial warrant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Held:</i>  The subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> did not violate the Fourth Amendment.   <i>Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling,</i> 327 U.S. 186, 66 S.Ct. 494, 90 L.Ed. 614, controlling.  An entry into the public lobby of a motel and restaurant for the purpose of serving an administrative subpoena is not the sort of governmental act that is forbidden by that Amendment.  Here, the subpoena itself did not authorize either entry or inspection of appellee's premises but merely directed appellee to produce certain wage and hour records, and no nonconsensual entry into areas not open to the public was made.   <i>Marshall v. Barlow's, Inc.,</i> 436 U.S. 307, 98 S.Ct. 1816, 56 L.Ed.2d 305, and <i>Camara v. Municipal Court,</i> 387 U.S. 523, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930, distinguished.  While a subpoenaed employer, in an action in federal district court, may question the reasonableness of a subpoena before suffering any penalties for refusing to comply with it, the available defenses do not include the right to insist upon a judicial warrant as a condition precedent to a valid subpoena.

The subpoena directed an officer or agent of appellee with personal knowledge of appellee's records to appear at the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor in Bismarck, North Dakota, and to produce certain payroll and sales records.  In an action filed by appellee to challenge the validity of the subpoena, the District Court for the District of North Dakota, 565 F.Supp. 229, held that, although the Secretary of Labor had complied with the applicable provisions of the FLSA in issuing the subpoena, enforcement of the subpoena would violate the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution because the Secretary had not previously obtained a judicial warrant.  We noted probable jurisdiction of the Secretary's appeal, --- U.S. ----, 103 S.Ct. 2451, 77 L.Ed.2d 1331 (1983), and we now reverse the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 6, 1982, Al Godes, a Compliance Officer with the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor, telephoned Susann White, appellee's manager, to inform her that he intended to begin an investigation of appellee the following morning and to request that she have available for inspection payroll records for all employees for the past two years.  White telephoned Godes later that day to inform him that it would not be convenient to conduct the inspection on the following morning.  After some preliminary skirmishing between the parties, during which appellee inquired about the scope and reason for the proposed investigation and appellants declined to provide specific information, Godes and Gerald Hill, Assistant Area Director from the Wage and Hour Division in Denver, arrived at appellee's premises on February 2, 1982, for the purpose of conducting the investigation.  After waiting for White, Godes served the administrative subpoena at issue here on one of appellee's other employees.  The subpoena was directed to any employee of appellee having custody and personal knowledge of the records specifically described therein, records which appellee was required by law to maintain.  See 29 CFR &#167;&#167; 516.2(a), 516.5(c) (1983).  The subpoena directed the employee to appear with those records at the Wage and Hour Office of the Department of Labor in Bismarck, North Dakota.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee refused to comply with the subpoena and sought declaratory and injunctive relief in the District Court, claiming that the subpoena constituted an unlawful search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  Appellants counterclaimed for enforcement of the subpoena.  The District Court concluded that the actions of appellants in issuing the administrative subpoena \"unquestionably comport with the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 201, <i>et seq.</i>\"  Juris. Statement 6a.  Relying on our decision in <i>Marshall v. Barlow's, Inc.,</i> 436 U.S. 307, 98 S.Ct. 1816, 56 L.Ed.2d 305 (1978), however, the District Court held that the applicable provisions of the FLSA violate the Fourth Amendment insofar as they authorize the Secretary of Labor to issue an administrative subpoena without previously having obtained a judicial warrant.  In <i>Barlow's</i> this Court declared unconstitutional the provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA) which authorized inspectors to enter an employer's premises without a warrant to conduct inspections of work areas.  The District Court rejected appellants' arguments that <i>Barlow's</i> is not dispositive of the issue here by stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"It is reasonable to conclude that the exigencies of an entry      upon commercial premises for the purpose of conducting a      safety and health inspection designed to protect the personal      well-being of employees supply more compelling bases for      proceeding without a warrant than the circumstances presented      here, where the entry is sought for the purpose of      determining compliance with wage and hour regulations.  The      reasoning of the Supreme Court in <i>Barlow's</i> applies with equal      if not greater&#8212;force in the instant situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, I hold that the Secretary of Labor may <i>not</i>      proceed to enter upon the premises of Lone Steer, Inc., for      the purpose of inspecting its records under &#167; 11 of the Fair      Labor Standards Act without first having obtained a valid warrant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Juris. Statement 8a.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that the District Court undertook to decide a case not before it when it held that appellants may not \"enter upon the premises\" of appellee to inspect its records without first having obtained a warrant.  The only \"entry\" upon appellee's premises by appellants, so far as the record discloses, is that of Godes on February 2, 1982, when he and Gerald Hill entered the motel and restaurant to attempt to conduct an investigation.  The stipulation of facts entered into by the parties, app. 11-17, and incorporated into the opinion of the District Court, juris. statement 2a-8a, describe what happened next:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"They asked for Ms. White and were told she was not available      but expected shortly.  They were offered some coffee, and      waited in the lobby area.  After 20-30 minutes, when Ms.      White had not appeared, Mr. Godes served an Administrative      Subpoena Duces Tecum on employee Karen Arnold.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">App. 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An entry into the public lobby of a motel and restaurant for the purpose of serving an administrative subpoena is scarcely the sort of governmental act which is forbidden by the Fourth Amendment.  The administrative subpoena itself did not authorize either entry or inspection of appellee's premises;  it merely directed appellee to produce relevant wage and hour records at appellants' regional office some 25 miles away.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The governmental actions which required antecedent administrative warrants in <i>Marshall v. Barlow's, Inc., supra,</i> and <i>Camara v. Municipal Court,</i> 387 U.S. 523, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967), are quite different from the governmental action in this case.  In <i>Barlow's</i> an OSHA inspector sought to conduct a search of non-public working areas of an electrical and plumbing installation business.  In <i>Camara</i> a San Francisco housing inspector sought to inspect the premises of an apartment building in that city.  See also <i>See v. City of Seattle,</i> 387 U.S. 541, 87 S.Ct. 1737, 18 L.Ed.2d 943 (1967) (involving a similar search by a fire inspector of commercial premises).  In each case, this Court held that an administrative warrant was required before such a search could be conducted without the consent of the owner of the premises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is plain to us that those cases turned upon the effort of the government inspectors to make non-consensual entries into areas not open to the public.  As we have indicated, no such entry was made by appellants in this case.  Thus the enforceability of the administrative subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> at issue here is governed, not by our decision in <i>Barlow's</i> as the District Court concluded, but rather by our decision in <i>Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling,</i> 327 U.S. 186, 66 S.Ct. 494, 90 L.Ed. 614 (1946).  In <i>Oklahoma Press</i> the Court rejected an employer's claim that the subpoena power conferred upon the Secretary of Labor by the FLSA violates the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The short answer to the Fourth Amendment objections is      that the records in these cases present no question of actual      search and seizure, but raise only the question whether      orders of court for the production of specified records have      been validly made;  and no sufficient showing appears to      justify setting them aside.  No officer or other person has      sought to enter petitioners' premises against their will, to      search them, or to seize or examine their books, records or      papers without their assent, otherwise than pursuant to      orders of court authorized by law and made after adequate opportunity to present objections . .      . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">327 U.S., at 195, 66 S.Ct., at 498 (footnotes omitted).  We cited <i>Oklahoma Press</i> with approval in <i>See v. City of Seattle, supra,</i> a companion case to <i>Camara,</i> and described the constitutional requirements for administrative subpoenas as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"It is now settled that, when an administrative agency      subpoenas corporate books or records, the Fourth Amendment      requires that the subpoena be sufficiently limited in scope,      relevant in purpose, and specific in directive so that      compliance will not be unreasonably burdensome.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>See v. City of Seattle, supra,</i> 387 U.S., at 544, 87 S.Ct., at 1740 (footnote omitted).  See also <i>United States v.

City of Seattle, supra,</i> 387 U.S., at 544-545, 87 S.Ct., at 1739-1740; <i>Oklahoma Press, supra,</i> 327 U.S., at 208-209, 66 S.Ct., at 505. Our holding here, which simply reaffirms our holding in <i>Oklahoma Press,</i> in no way leaves an employer defenseless against an unreasonably burdensome administrative subpoena requiring the production of documents.  We hold only that the defenses available to an employer do not include the right to insist upon a judicial warrant as a condition precedent to a valid administrative subpoena.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee insists that \"[t]he official inspection procedure used by the appellants reveal[s] that the use of the administrative subpoena is inextricably intertwined with the entry process,\" Brief for Appellee 11, and states that it is appellants' established policy to seek entry inspections by expressly relying on its inspection authority under &#167; 11 of the FLSA.  <i>Id.,</i> at 12.

After 20-30 minutes, when Ms. White had not appeared, Mr. Godes served an Administrative Subpoena Duces Tecum on employee Karen Arnold.\" App. 15.</blockquote>\n<p>An entry into the public lobby of a motel and restaurant for the purpose of serving an administrative subpoena is scarcely the sort of governmental act which is forbidden by the Fourth Amendment. The administrative subpoena itself did not authorize either entry or inspection of appellee's premises; it merely directed appellee to produce relevant wage and hour records at appellants' regional office some 25 miles away.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*414</span> The governmental actions which required antecedent administrative warrants in <i>Marshall</i> v. <i>Barlow's, Inc., supra</i><i>,</i> and <i>Camara</i> v. <i>Municipal Court,</i> 387 U. S. 523 (1967), are quite different from the governmental action in this case. In <i>Barlow's</i> an OSHA inspector sought to conduct a search of nonpublic working areas of an electrical and plumbing installation business. In <i>Camara</i> a San Francisco housing inspector sought to inspect the premises of an apartment building in that city. See also <i>See</i> v. <i>City of Seattle,</i> 387 U. S. 541 (1967) (involving a similar search by a fire inspector of commercial premises). In each case, this Court held that an administrative warrant was required before such a search could be conducted without the consent of the owner of the premises.</p>\n<p>It is plain to us that those cases turned upon the effort of the government inspectors to make nonconsensual entries into areas not open to the public. As we have indicated, no such entry was made by appellants in this case. Thus the enforceability of the administrative subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> at issue here is governed, not by our decision in <i>Barlow's</i> as the District Court concluded, but rather by our decision in <i>Oklahoma Press Publishing Co.</i> v. <i>Walling,</i> 327 U. S. 186 (1946). In <i>Oklahoma Press</i> the Court rejected an employer's claim that the subpoena power conferred upon the Secretary of Labor by the FLSA violates the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<blockquote>\"The short answer to the Fourth Amendment objections is that the records in these cases present no question of actual search and seizure, but raise only the question whether orders of court for the production of specified records have been validly made; and no sufficient showing appears to justify setting them aside. No officer or other person has sought to enter petitioners' premises against their will, to search them, or to seize or examine their books, records or papers without their assent, otherwise than pursuant to orders of court authorized by law <span class=\"star-pagination\">*415</span> and made after adequate opportunity to present objections. . . .\" <i>Id.,</i> at 195 (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>We cited <i>Oklahoma Press</i> with approval in <i>See</i> v. <i>City of Seattle, supra</i><i>,</i> a companion case to <i>Camara,</i> and described the constitutional requirements for administrative subpoenas as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"It is now settled that, when an administrative agency subpoenas corporate books or records, the Fourth Amendment requires that the subpoena be sufficiently limited in scope, relevant in purpose, and specific in directive so that compliance will not be unreasonably burdensome.\" <i>See</i> v. <i>City of Seattle, supra,</i> at 544 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>See also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morton Salt Co.,</i> 338 U. S. 632, 652-653 (1950).</p>\n<p>Thus although our cases make it clear that the Secretary of Labor may issue an administrative subpoena without a warrant, they nonetheless provide protection for a subpoenaed employer by allowing him to question the reasonableness of the subpoena, before suffering any penalties for refusing to comply with it, by raising objections in an action in district court. <i>See</i> v. <i>City of Seattle, supra,</i> at 544-545; <i>Oklahoma Press, supra,</i> at 208-209. Our holding here, which simply reaffirms our holding in <i>Oklahoma Press,</i> in no way leaves an employer defenseless against an unreasonably burdensome administrative subpoena requiring the production of documents. We hold only that the defenses available to an employer do not include the right to insist upon a judicial warrant as a condition precedent to a valid administrative subpoena.</p>\n<p>Appellee insists that \"[t]he official inspection procedure used by the appellants reveal[s] that the use of the administrative subpoena is inextricably intertwined with the entry process,\" Brief for Appellee 11, and states that it is appellants' <span class=\"star-pagination\">*416</span> established policy to seek entry inspections by expressly relying on its inspection authority under § 11 of the FLSA. <i>Id.,</i> at 12.

S. C. § 211(a), authorizes the Secretary of Labor to investigate and gather data regarding wages, hours, and other conditions of employment to determine whether an employer is violating the Act.<sup>[1]</sup> Section <span class=\"star-pagination\">*410</span> 9 of the FLSA, 29 U. S. C. § 209, empowers the Secretary of Labor to subpoena witnesses and documentary evidence relating to any matter under investigation.<sup>[2]</sup> Pursuant to those provisions, an official of the Department of Labor served an administrative subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> on an employee of appellee Lone Steer, Inc., a motel and restaurant located in Steele, N. D. The subpoena directed an officer or agent of appellee with personal knowledge of appellee's records to appear at the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor in Bismarck, N. D., and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*411</span> to produce certain payroll and sales records. In an action filed by appellee to challenge the validity of the subpoena, the District Court for the District of North Dakota held that, although the Secretary of Labor had complied with the applicable provisions of the FLSA in issuing the subpoena, enforcement of the subpoena would violate the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution because the Secretary had not previously obtained a judicial warrant. We noted probable jurisdiction of the Secretary's appeal, 462 U. S. 1105 (1983), and we now reverse the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p>On January 6, 1982, Al Godes, a Compliance Officer with the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor, telephoned Susanne White, appellee's manager, to inform her that he intended to begin an investigation of appellee the following morning and to request that she have available for inspection payroll records for all employees for the past two years. White telephoned Godes later that day to inform him that it would not be convenient to conduct the inspection on the following morning. After some preliminary skirmishing between the parties, during which appellee inquired about the scope and reason for the proposed investigation and appellants declined to provide specific information, Godes and Gerald Hill, Assistant Area Director from the Wage and Hour Division in Denver, arrived at appellee's premises on February 2, 1982, for the purpose of conducting the investigation. After waiting for White, Godes served the administrative subpoena at issue here on one of appellee's other employees. The subpoena was directed to any employee of appellee having custody and personal knowledge of the records specifically described therein, records which appellee was required by law to maintain. See 29 CFR §§ 516.2(a), 516.5(c) (1983). The subpoena directed the employee to appear with those records at the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor in Bismarck, N. D.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*412</span> Appellee refused to comply with the subpoena and sought declaratory and injunctive relief in the District Court, claiming that the subpoena constituted an unlawful search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Appellants counterclaimed for enforcement of the subpoena. The District Court concluded that the actions of appellants in issuing the administrative subpoena \"unquestionably comport with the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, 29 U. S. C. § 201, <i>et seq.</i>\" App. A to Juris. Statement 6a. Relying on our decision in <i>Marshall</i> v. <i>Barlow's, Inc.,</i> 436 U. S. 307 (1978), however, the District Court held that the applicable provisions of the FLSA violate the Fourth Amendment insofar as they authorize the Secretary of Labor to issue an administrative subpoena without previously having obtained a judicial warrant. In <i>Barlow's</i> this Court declared unconstitutional the provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA) which authorized inspectors to enter an employer's premises without a warrant to conduct inspections of work areas. The District Court rejected appellants' arguments that <i>Barlow's</i> is not dispositive of the issue here by stating:</p>\n<blockquote>\"It is reasonable to conclude that the exigencies of an entry upon commercial premises for the purpose of conducting a safety and health inspection designed to protect the personal well-being of employees supply more compelling bases for proceeding without a warrant than the circumstances presented here, where entry is sought for the purpose of determining compliance with wage and hour regulations. The reasoning of the Supreme Court in <i>Barlow's</i> applies with equal  if not greater  force in the instant situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"In sum, I hold that the Secretary of Labor may <i>not</i> proceed to enter upon the premises of Lone Steer, Inc., for the purpose of inspecting its records under SECTION 11 of the Fair Labor Standards Act without first having <span class=\"star-pagination\">*413</span> obtained a valid warrant.\" App. A to Juris. Statement 8a.<sup>[3]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>We think that the District Court undertook to decide a case not before it when it held that appellants may not \"enter upon the premises\" of appellee to inspect its records without first having obtained a warrant. The only \"entry\" upon appellee's premises by appellants, so far as the record discloses, is that of Godes on February 2, 1982, when he and Gerald Hill entered the motel and restaurant to attempt to conduct an investigation. The stipulation of facts entered into by the parties, App. 11-17, and incorporated into the opinion of the District Court, App. A to Juris. Statement 2a-8a, describe what happened next:</p>\n<blockquote>\"They asked for Ms. White and were told she was not available but expected shortly.
