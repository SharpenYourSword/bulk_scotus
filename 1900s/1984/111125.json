We have mandated this inquiry;  but we have failed to articulate any standard of review for alleged <i>Witherspoon</i> violations.  We have failed to explain whether a trial court's determination that a given venireman may be excluded for cause under <i>Witherspoon</i> should be reversed only if, like other factual determinations, it is clearly erroneous or whether an appellate court must examine the transcript of the voir dire and draw its own conclusions, with no deference accorded the trial court's judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a>  The result, predictably, has been near chaos throughout the state and federal appellate courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A review of the decisions of twenty States which have grappled with the application of <i>Witherspoon</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> shows that appellate courts in seven of those States grant trial courts considerable discretion in excusing jurors based on their opposition to the death penalty and will disturb such rulings only for a clear abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Six States, including Texas, grant no leeway whatsoever to the trial court.  The appellate courts conduct their own review of the record and make their own <i>de novo</i> determination of the propriety of any exclusions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The other seven States, without explicitly mentioning any standard, also appear to engage in <i>de novo</i> review, combing the record for errors with no mention of, or deference to, the trial court's opportunity to observe the demeanor of the veniremen and hear the tenor of their responses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The degree of confusion and the number of conflicting decisions among the state courts on such an important issue of federal constitutional law are troublesome, to say the least. This same disarray exists in federal courts entertaining petitions for writs of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254.  For example, a panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recently split three ways on the question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  And the Eleventh Circuit reached opposite results on the proper standard of review in two recent cases and has granted rehearing en banc in one of the cases to consider the issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  I believe this Court has an obligation to clarify its holding in <i>Witherspoon</i> and to resolve these conflicts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, there is no simple litmus test for determining when a juror would automatically vote against imposition of the death penalty or be unable to make an impartial decision as to the defendant's guilt.  Of necessity, therefore, the voir dire examination of veniremen in capital cases has become an elaborate and frustrating process.

Given the nature of the question presented, the petition primarily consists of a transcript of the <i>voir dire</i> examination of the excused venireman.  In other words, Texas asks that <i>this Court</i> conduct a <i>de novo</i> review on the <i>Witherspoon</i> issue.</p>\n        <p>The dissent's reasoning in attempting to suggest that the \"deference\" question was even decided below, much less presented in the petition, is quite difficult to follow.  Justice Rehnquist finds \"no support in our case law for the utter absence of deference paid to the trial court's judgment in this case,\" <i>post,</i> at 1048, but somehow concludes that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals apparently felt that it was required to disregard totally the trial court's judgment on the basis of our case law, <i>post,</i> at 1044, n. 2, notwithstanding the fact that in <i>Hughes v.

Pet., at A-21.  In light of the fact that the only statement ever made by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on the \"deference\" question is favorable to the prosecution, it is no wonder that Texas did not present this question in its petition.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The dissenting opinion below, it should be noted, was filed regarding the court's denial without opinion of the State's second motion for rehearing.  One perhaps could speculate on the basis of the papers we have before us that the State attempted to raise the \"deference\" issue in its second motion for rehearing, since the issue was discussed at the close of the dissenting opinion.  <i>Id.,</i> at A-21 to A-22.  It would appear, however, from the dissenting opinion that the propriety of the arguments presented in the state's second motion was in some doubt, and the dissent was quite prepared to reconsider the case <i>sua sponte. Id.,</i> at A-1 to A-2.  There was no response to the dissent,</p>\n        <p>the language in <i>Hughes</i> was not disapproved by the majority, and hence there are two reasonable conclusions:  (1) the majority below, even after giving deference to the trial court's ability to observe the demeanor of the venireman, nevertheless concluded that his excusal for cause was erroneous;  or (2) the State had waived whatever arguments it raised in its second motion for rehearing as a matter of state practice by failing to raise them earlier.  Of course, since Texas is not raising the \"deference\" question in its petition, it is understandable that it has not attempted to show that the question was properly raised below.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The court reversed Mead's conviction and remanded the case for a new trial.

Because of the substantial disarray among state and federal appellate courts as to the degree of deference, if any, due to a trial court's determination that a juror may be excluded for cause under <i>Witherspoon,</i> I would grant certiorari to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and review the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Witherspoon,</i> 391 U.S., at 522, 88 S.Ct., at 1777, we held that a venireman cannot be excluded for cause in a capital case simply because he voices \"general objections\" to the death penalty or expresses \"conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction.\"  Provided the venireman is willing to fulfill his oath as a juror and consider the full range of penalties provided by state law, he may not be disqualified on account of his beliefs.  We stressed, however, that the State is not disabled from challenging jurors for cause when they make it clear that they would \"vote against the penalty of death regardless of the facts and circumstances that might emerge in the course of the proceedings.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 522, n. 21, 88 S.Ct., at 1777, n. 21.  In subsequent cases we have reaffirmed that the State has a legitimate interest in obtaining jurors who will consider and decide the facts impartially and faithfully apply the law as charged by the court.  <i>Adams v. Texas,</i> 448 U.S. 38, 46, 100 S.Ct. 2521, 2527, 65 L.Ed.2d 581 (1980);  <i>Lockett v. Ohio,</i> 438 U.S. 586, 596-597, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 2960-2961, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978);  <i>Boulden v.

We have mandated this inquiry;  but we have failed to articulate any standard of review for alleged <i>Witherspoon</i> violations.  We have failed to explain whether a trial court's determination that a given venireman may be excluded for cause under <i>Witherspoon</i> should be reversed only if, like other factual determinations, it is clearly erroneous or whether an appellate court must examine the transcript of the voir dire and draw its own conclusions, with no deference accorded the trial court's judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a>  The result, predictably, has been near chaos throughout the state and federal appellate courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A review of the decisions of twenty States which have grappled with the application of <i>Witherspoon</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> shows that appellate courts in seven of those States grant trial courts considerable discretion in excusing jurors based on their opposition to the death penalty and will disturb such rulings only for a clear abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Six States, including Texas, grant no leeway whatsoever to the trial court.

For example, a panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recently split three ways on the question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  And the Eleventh Circuit reached opposite results on the proper standard of review in two recent cases and has granted rehearing en banc in one of the cases to consider the issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  I believe this Court has an obligation to clarify its holding in <i>Witherspoon</i> and to resolve these conflicts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, there is no simple litmus test for determining when a juror would automatically vote against imposition of the death penalty or be unable to make an impartial decision as to the defendant's guilt.

On the contrary, we have constantly stressed that \"actual bias\" on the part of a particular juror is a question of \"historical fact,\" <i>Rushen v.

No other justice recorded a dissent from that denial.  Moreover, had THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice REHNQUIST, and Justice O'CONNOR, who today find the question warranting an exercise of certiorari jurisdiction, voted to grant in that case, under our Rule of Four the question would now be before us, and hence there would presumably be no need for today's dissenting opinion.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Of course, if the petition in this case had been granted, the parties would naturally have briefed the question that is presented and argued in Texas's petition.

Given the nature of the question presented, the petition primarily consists of a transcript of the <i>voir dire</i> examination of the excused venireman.  In other words, Texas asks that <i>this Court</i> conduct a <i>de novo</i> review on the <i>Witherspoon</i> issue.</p>\n        <p>The dissent's reasoning in attempting to suggest that the \"deference\" question was even decided below, much less presented in the petition, is quite difficult to follow.  Justice Rehnquist finds \"no support in our case law for the utter absence of deference paid to the trial court's judgment in this case,\" <i>post,</i> at 1048, but somehow concludes that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals apparently felt that it was required to disregard totally the trial court's judgment on the basis of our case law, <i>post,</i> at 1044, n. 2, notwithstanding the fact that in <i>Hughes v.

Pet., at A-21.  In light of the fact that the only statement ever made by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on the \"deference\" question is favorable to the prosecution, it is no wonder that Texas did not present this question in its petition.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The dissenting opinion below, it should be noted, was filed regarding the court's denial without opinion of the State's second motion for rehearing.  One perhaps could speculate on the basis of the papers we have before us that the State attempted to raise the \"deference\" issue in its second motion for rehearing, since the issue was discussed at the close of the dissenting opinion.  <i>Id.,</i> at A-21 to A-22.  It would appear, however, from the dissenting opinion that the propriety of the arguments presented in the state's second motion was in some doubt, and the dissent was quite prepared to reconsider the case <i>sua sponte.

There was no response to the dissent,</p>\n        <p>the language in <i>Hughes</i> was not disapproved by the majority, and hence there are two reasonable conclusions:  (1) the majority below, even after giving deference to the trial court's ability to observe the demeanor of the venireman, nevertheless concluded that his excusal for cause was erroneous;  or (2) the State had waived whatever arguments it raised in its second motion for rehearing as a matter of state practice by failing to raise them earlier.
