Mr. Autry has already endured the profound psychological torment of lying strapped to a gurney for over an hour with an intravenous needle in his arm, waiting to be put to death.  That wait was brought to an end by the grant of a last-minute stay permitting him time to vindicate his constitutional rights.  Following today's decision, however, he will again have to undergo the same indignity and psychological anguish, knowing that this time will probably be the last.  Faced with such circumstances, I for one refuse to accept the notion implicit in today's decision that we have kept faith with the dual promise of the Eighth Amendment that the state's power to punish is \"exercised within the limits of civilized standards,\" and that we keep pace with the \"evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society\" in carrying out criminal punishments.  <i>Id.,</i> at 100-101, 78 S.Ct. at 597-598.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "", "html_with_citations": "<p class=\"case_cite\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1090</span></span></p>\n    <p class=\"case_cite\">104 S.Ct. 1462</p>\n    <p class=\"case_cite\">79 L.Ed.2d 909</p>\n    <p class=\"parties\">James David AUTRY<br>v.<br>Dan V.
