The Court of Appeals' judgment, affirming an order entered by the District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, requires the Secretary:  (1) to promulgate regulations adopting a <i>nationwide</i> 180-day time limit for the rendering of decisions in disability benefit cases under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act, and (2) to promulgate regulations imposing a <i>nationwide</i> 90-day time limit for the rendering of decisions in disability termination cases under Title XVI of that Act. Although respondents requested only that the Secretary immediately be required to provide hearings and appeals to Kentucky class members, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's order without limiting it in any way.  The Secretary attests that the Solicitor General has determined that a petition for a writ of certiorari will be filed to seek review of this order.  She further suggests that, in the meantime, it makes no sense to order her to impose nationwide time limits when this Court is about to address the propriety of a court's imposing such deadlines in even one <i>state</i> in <i>Heckler v. Day,</i> No. 82-1371 (argued December 5, 1983).  Accordingly, she seeks a stay from this Court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My obligation as a Circuit Justice in considering a stay application is \"to determine whether Four Justices would vote to grant certiorari, to balance the so-called 'stay-equities,' and to give some consideration as to predicting the final outcome of the case in this Court.\"  <i>Gregory-Portland Independent School District v.

The instant case presents issues of potentially even greater legal and social significance than does <i>Day,</i> because the court below has imposed on the Secretary the obligation to promulgate nationwide, as opposed to statewide, regulations.

Imposition of nationwide time limits would, in all likelihood, require a substantial restructuring of the existing claims adjudication and appeals process.  Respondents consist only of residents of Kentucky, and therefore have no standing to insist upon the imposition of deadlines for decisions on claims filed by residents of other states, as the courts below have ordered.  Moreover, since the District Court's order had been stayed for almost 20 months prior to the Court of Appeals' decision, the extension of that stay for several more months until this Court decides <i>Day</i> should not cause significant incremental hardship to the interests respondents represent in Kentucky.  The Secretary remains under her statutory duty to provide hearings and appeals within a reasonable period of time, and I must assume that she will abide by the statutory requirement and make all reasonable efforts to mitigate the hardships that members of the respondent class undoubtedly suffer pending resolution of their claims.  But since imposition of time limits would necessarily require a period of transition, it is unlikely that immediate implementation of the District Court's order would produce benefits for claimants in Kentucky or elsewhere.
