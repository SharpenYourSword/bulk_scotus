Among those materials were various reports that cast doubt on petitioner's sanity and capacity to understand legal proceedings.

The director went on to cite petitioner's \" 'serious mental and emotional handicaps,' \" concluding that petitioner's \" '[r]ehabilitative rating is very poor.' \" Id., at 745.

It is equally clear that statements made by a defendant in the course of a court-ordered competency exam cannot be used against him in either the liability phase or the penalty phase of his trial unless the defendant makes an intelligent and voluntary waiver of his privilege against self-incrimination.

A trial judge may not put a defendant to the choice of forgoing either his right to a competency exam or his right to limit the admissibility of statements he makes during such an exam. Cf. Simmons v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107636\"><a href=\"/opinion/107636/simmons-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></a></span>, 393-394, 88 S.Ct. 967, 975-976, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals upheld the denial of habeas relief in this case on the ground that the evidence available to the trial judge at the time he made his ruling was insufficient to cast doubt on petitioner's competency. The Court of Appeals made two points in support of this conclusion. First, the trial judge had had an opportunity to observe petitioner in the course of his first trial and in the preliminary stages of the second trial, and petitioner had participated competently in those proceedings. Second, the psychiatric episode that had recently come to the parties' attention had occurred when petitioner was 17, 20 years before the time of the second trial, and thus had little probative value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, the factors relied upon by the Court of Appeals are insufficient to support its conclusion. In Drope v. Missouri, supra, 420 U.S., at 180, 95 S.Ct., at 908, we described as follows the standard to be applied by trial judges in situations of this sort:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The import of our decision in Pate v. Robinson is that      evidence of a defendant's irrational behavior, his demeanor      at trial, and any prior medical opinion on competence to      stand trial are all relevant in determining whether further      inquiry is required, but that even one of these factors      standing alone may, in some circumstances, be sufficient.      There are, of course, no fixed or immutable signs which      invariably indicate the need for further inquiry to determine      fitness to proceed; the question is often a difficult one in      which a wide range of manifestations and subtle nuances are      implicated.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time he was called upon to assess defense counsel's motion, the trial judge in this case was aware of several reports describing petitioner's \"paranoid\" and \"schizophrenic\" behavior. The judge was also aware that petitioner had a serious and seemingly ineradicable heroin addiction. Petitioner's probation records contained reports from psychiatrists regarding petitioner's \"psychopathic personality.\" Finally, the judge had just been informed that petitioner had been confined in a mental hospital at the age of 17 because of hallucinations. In sum, a substantial body of both medical evidence and evidence pertaining to petitioner's behavior cast doubt upon petitioner's ability to comprehend the proceedings against him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Surely the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the cumulation of these data was insufficient to entitle petitioner to a competency exam.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The foregoing conclusion is reinforced by the fact that both the prosecutor and the state trial judge agreed that petitioner should have been given an examination. In response to defense counsel's motion, the prosecutor conceded that, \"the way the case law is,\" both the trial court and defense counsel had an obligation to have petitioner examined. Tr. 1865. The judge thereupon expressed his willingness to order an examination; he simply refused to limit the admissibility of statements made by petitioner during that exam. Id., at 1866.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In short, the persons best situated to assess petitioner's state of mind were unanimous in their view that a competency examination was warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In elaborating its argument rejecting petitioner's constitutional claim, the Court of Appeals relied in part on this Court's refusal hitherto to \"prescribe a general standard with respect to the nature or quantum of evidence necessary to require resort to\" a competency exam, Drope v. Missouri, supra, at 172, 95 S.Ct., at 904. See 709 F.2d, at 950, n. 3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> If our failure to clarify this area of the law has the effect of defeating claims as substantial as that made by petitioner, it is time we reconsidered the issue of a defendant's entitlement to a competency exam and set a standard that would provide lower courts better guidance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would grant the petition and set the case for argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Adhering to my view that the death penalty is unconstitutional in all circumstances, Gregg v.

Even if one concedes that the trial judge's ruling did not rise to the level of a finding of fact, the judge's receptivity to petitioner's constitutional claim (reflected in the judge's willingness to order a competency exam despite the fact that the jury had already been empaneled) surely is entitled to more weight than it was given by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Other Courts of Appeals have also emphasized the absence of any \"general standard\" enunciated in our two decisions in this field.

United States, 390 U.S. 377, 393-394, 88 S.Ct. 967, 975-976, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals upheld the denial of habeas relief in this case on the ground that the evidence available to the trial judge at the time he made his ruling was insufficient to cast doubt on petitioner's competency. The Court of Appeals made two points in support of this conclusion. First, the trial judge had had an opportunity to observe petitioner in the course of his first trial and in the preliminary stages of the second trial, and petitioner had participated competently in those proceedings. Second, the psychiatric episode that had recently come to the parties' attention had occurred when petitioner was 17, 20 years before the time of the second trial, and thus had little probative value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, the factors relied upon by the Court of Appeals are insufficient to support its conclusion. In Drope v. Missouri, supra, 420 U.S., at 180, 95 S.Ct., at 908, we described as follows the standard to be applied by trial judges in situations of this sort:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The import of our decision in Pate v. Robinson is that      evidence of a defendant's irrational behavior, his demeanor      at trial, and any prior medical opinion on competence to      stand trial are all relevant in determining whether further      inquiry is required, but that even one of these factors      standing alone may, in some circumstances, be sufficient.      There are, of course, no fixed or immutable signs which      invariably indicate the need for further inquiry to determine      fitness to proceed; the question is often a difficult one in      which a wide range of manifestations and subtle nuances are      implicated.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time he was called upon to assess defense counsel's motion, the trial judge in this case was aware of several reports describing petitioner's \"paranoid\" and \"schizophrenic\" behavior. The judge was also aware that petitioner had a serious and seemingly ineradicable heroin addiction. Petitioner's probation records contained reports from psychiatrists regarding petitioner's \"psychopathic personality.\" Finally, the judge had just been informed that petitioner had been confined in a mental hospital at the age of 17 because of hallucinations. In sum, a substantial body of both medical evidence and evidence pertaining to petitioner's behavior cast doubt upon petitioner's ability to comprehend the proceedings against him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Surely the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the cumulation of these data was insufficient to entitle petitioner to a competency exam.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The foregoing conclusion is reinforced by the fact that both the prosecutor and the state trial judge agreed that petitioner should have been given an examination. In response to defense counsel's motion, the prosecutor conceded that, \"the way the case law is,\" both the trial court and defense counsel had an obligation to have petitioner examined. Tr. 1865. The judge thereupon expressed his willingness to order an examination; he simply refused to limit the admissibility of statements made by petitioner during that exam. Id., at 1866.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In short, the persons best situated to assess petitioner's state of mind were unanimous in their view that a competency examination was warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In elaborating its argument rejecting petitioner's constitutional claim, the Court of Appeals relied in part on this Court's refusal hitherto to \"prescribe a general standard with respect to the nature or quantum of evidence necessary to require resort to\" a competency exam, Drope v. Missouri, supra, at 172, 95 S.Ct., at 904. See 709 F.2d, at 950, n. 3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> If our failure to clarify this area of the law has the effect of defeating claims as substantial as that made by petitioner, it is time we reconsidered the issue of a defendant's entitlement to a competency exam and set a standard that would provide lower courts better guidance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would grant the petition and set the case for argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Adhering to my view that the death penalty is unconstitutional in all circumstances, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2973, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would grant the petition and vacate the sentence even if petitioner had not presented the substantial claim discussed in the text.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Cf. Acosta v. Turner, 666 F.2d 949, 954-955 (CA5 1982); Bruce v. Estelle, 536 F.2d 1051, 1062-1063 (CA5 1976) (discussing the potential impact of schizophrenia upon a defendant's capacity to understand judicial proceedings), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1053, 97 S.Ct. 767, 50 L.Ed.2d 770 (1977).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The Court of Appeals brushed aside these concessions, discounting the judge's expressed willingness to order an exam as irrelevant to the issue of petitioner's right to an exam, and dismissing the prosecutor's judgment as \"mistaken.\" Porter v. Estelle, 709 F.2d 944, 953-954 (1983). Even if one concedes that the trial judge's ruling did not rise to the level of a finding of fact, the judge's receptivity to petitioner's constitutional claim (reflected in the judge's willingness to order a competency exam despite the fact that the jury had already been empaneled) surely is entitled to more weight than it was given by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Other Courts of Appeals have also emphasized the absence of any \"general standard\" enunciated in our two decisions in this field.
