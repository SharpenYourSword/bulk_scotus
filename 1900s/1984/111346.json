I cannot participate in the cruel irony visited on this applicant by the Court today.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Doyle Edward Skillern is one of the eight plaintiffs in <i>Chaney.</i>  Those plaintiffs allege that lethal drugs used to carry out death sentences in Texas and Oklahoma cause \"agonizingly slow and painful deaths\" and consequently are not \"safe and effective\" for their intended use in executions, as allegedly is required under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 301 <i>et seq.</i>  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed that the Food and Drug Administration has a statutory duty to investigate this claim, and indicated that it was prepared to \"compel\" the FDA to take action against the lethal drugs.  <i>Chaney v. Heckler,</i> 231 U.S.App.D.C. 136, 153, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">718</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1174</span></span>, 1191 (1983).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The merits of the Court of Appeals' action and order in <i>Chaney</i> are not before us on this application.  In March 1984, the Solicitor General of the United States filed an application for stay of the Court of Appeals' mandate in <i>Chaney,</i> arguing that the decision was \"likely to interfere with state enforcement of capital punishment statutes. . . .\"  Application in <i>Heckler v. Chaney,</i> No. 83-1878, p. 6.  \"[I]f the mandate is not stayed, the FDA will in all likelihood be required . . . to regulate the method of capital punishment used in several states,\" including Texas.  <i>Id.,</i> at 10.  THE CHIEF JUSTICE granted the motion for stay of the mandate based on this understanding of the effect of the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus the Government and this Court have proceeded in the <i>Chaney</i> case on the assumption that success by the plaintiffs will delay and perhaps ultimately preclude their execution by lethal injection.  Yet today the Court decides to send one of those plaintiffs to his death by the very method challenged in <i>Chaney.</i> The Court obviously considers the issues in <i>Chaney</i> substantial enough to warrant plenary consideration.  But despite our assertion of jurisdiction over applicant and his claim in <i>Chaney,</i> Texas subsequently has determined to execute applicant by lethal injection tomorrow morning.  I am aware of no precedent that has permitted irreparable injury to a party in a case receiving plenary consideration from this Court when the subject matter of the case is so intimately related to the threatened harm.  The same question would arise if <i>Chaney</i> raised a question of bankruptcy enforcement law and Texas were threatening to foreclose on applicant's home despite this Court's pending consideration of the legality of the method.  It is only mere chance that this applicant has seven coplaintiffs in his case;  were he the only plaintiff, surely his execution would moot any decision we might render in <i>Chaney.</i>  The fortuity of multiple plaintiffs should not skew the Court's analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The applicant argued in his 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 action below that, by executing him and thereby mooting his opportunity to litigate his case regarding the very method of execution at issue, Texas will deprive the applicant of his right to have his claim considered by the federal courts.  The Courts of Appeals are unanimous in their discussion of the elements requiring consideration to obtain a stay under &#167; 1983:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"(1) whether the movant has made a showing of likelihood of      success on the merits, (2) whether the movant has made a      showing of irreparable injury if the stay is not granted, (3)      whether the granting of the stay would substantially harm the      other parties, and (4) whether the granting of the stay would      serve the public interest.  <i>Ruiz v.

While 'the movant need not <i>always</i>      show a \"probability\" of success on the merits,' he must      'present a substantial case on the merits when a serious      legal question is involved and show that <i>the balance of the      equities,</i> [i.e. the other three factors] <i>weighs heavily in      the favor of granting the stay.</i>' \"  <i>O'Bryan v.

Irreparability of the injury is obvious.  No possible harm can result to the Department if appellant's execution is stayed pending our decision in <i>Chaney.</i> And certainly the public interest is not served if a party to a case receiving plenary consideration before the highest Court in the land is compelled to undergo the very injury whose legality his case challenges.  Any interest in finality or execution of the State's death penalty law will, at worst, simply be delayed but not denied if the decision in <i>Chaney</i> is adverse to the applicant.  And if that decision were to go in the applicant's favor, then a stay will have prevented a harm the legality of which will be open to serious question under federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondents' only argument against a stay is that applicant's likelihood of success on the merits is slim.  That may be so in the Fifth Circuit, which rejected a claim similar to applicant's in <i>O'Bryan, supra</i> (although, interestingly, the <i>O'Bryan</i> court did not discuss the three equitable factors required by its own precedents).  But the argument loses any force before this Court, which is currently giving plenary consideration to a split between the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and the Court of Appeals that decided <i>Chaney</i> on the very issue applicant presents. Even the Solicitor General has advised us that if applicant succeeds in <i>Chaney,</i> his execution will likely be \"interfere[d]\" with.  Application in <i>Heckler v. Chaney,</i> No. 83-1878, p. 6.  Our grant of the writ of certiorari in <i>Chaney</i> provides all the answer required to the question whether there is a \"serious legal question involved\" in applicant's claim, see <i>Autry v.
