Some state courts have held that the exclusionary rule applies.  See <i>New York State Liquor Authority v. Finn's Liquor Shop Inc.,</i> 24 N.Y.2d 647, 301 N.Y.S.2d 584, 249 N.E.2d 440, cert. denied, 396 U.S. 840, 90 S.Ct. 103, 24 L.Ed.2d 91 (1969);  <i>Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board v. Leonardziak,</i> 210 Pa.Super. 511, 233 A.2d 606 (1967) (exclusionary rule applies in Liquor Control Board proceeding in which Board imposed fine, but could also have revoked license).  Illinois, on the other hand, admits evidence obtained during a search pursuant to an invalid warrant on the reasoning that the State can and does require consent to a warrantless search as a prerequisite to the issuance of a liquor license.  <i>Daley v.

A Rhode Island judge in related criminal proceedings subsequently ruled that the evidence had been obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  <i>Rhode Island v. Benoit,</i> No. N2/77-51 (Super.Ct. Newport Cty., R.I., Jan. 16, 1978).  The Attic Lounge then argued that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment could not be admitted in a civil hearing to revoke its liquor license.  The Rhode Island Liquor Control Administrator reversed the decision of the Tiverton Commissioners on unrelated grounds, and directed that the license be reinstated.  After losing an appeal to the State Superior Court, Civ. Action No. 78-2659 (Super.Ct., Providence Cty., R.I., Aug. 6, 1980), the Tiverton Commissioners obtained review in the Rhode Island Supreme Court through a petition for certiorari naming both the Attic Lounge and the Liquor Control Administrator as respondents.

Tr. of Oral Arg. 28, 31.  The case is therefore moot.
