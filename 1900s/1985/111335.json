Petitioners gave respondents over $45,000 to invest in the commodities futures market.  Investment decisions were left entirely to respondents, who received a commission for each transaction they conducted.  The accounts were soon worth far less than $45,000, and petitioners canceled the agreements.  They then brought the present action in Federal District Court, alleging violations of federal and state securities laws.  The District Court entered judgment for petitioners, concluding that the advertisement had been false and misleading and that the accounts constituted \"investment contracts\" within the meaning of the federal securities laws.  See 15 U.S.C. &#167; 77b.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  686 F.2d 815 (CA9 1982).  It held that because respondents' prosperity did not hinge on the success or failure of petitioners' investments&#8212;respondents earned $20,000 in commissions while petitioners were losing $27,000&#8212;the required \"common enterprise\" was lacking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 defines \"security\" to include an \"investment contract.\"  48 Stat. 74, as amended, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 77b(1).  Almost 40 years ago this Court held that an \"investment contract\" is a \"contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party . . . .\"  <i>SEC v. Howey Co.,</i> 328 U.S. 293, 298-299, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 1102-1103, 90 L.Ed. 1244 (1946).  The lower courts have disagreed over whether a trading account like that involved here satisfies the requirement of a \"common enterprise.\"  Some require a pooling of investments&#8212;horizontal commonality.  See <i>Curran v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce,</i> Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., 622 F.2d 216 (CA6 1980), aff'd on other grounds, 456 U.S. 353, 102 S.Ct. 1825, 72 L.Ed.2d 182 (1982); <i>Hirk v.

Under this approach, discretionary futures contracts do not qualify as securities. Other courts require only the existence of a relationship between an investor and a broker&#8212;vertical commonality&#8212;and reach the opposite result.  <i>SEC v.

Under the Ninth Circuit's rule it is not enough that the promoter has control of the investments. \"Vertical commonality\" also requires a correlation between the success of the promoter and that of the accounts themselves.
