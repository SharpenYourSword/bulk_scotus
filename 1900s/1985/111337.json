(Gould), discontinued its operations at the Wilkening plant, where it had employed respondents.  Under a pension plan negotiated with respondents' union, assets were to be used first to pay pensions to \"current retirees\"&#8212;beneficiaries who had already retired.  If any assets then remained, they were to go to employees with vested rights to benefits, as they reached retirement age.  When the plant closed, however, the pension fund's relevant assets were insufficient to pay even the current retirees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondents' union brought a grievance under the collective-bargaining agreement, seeking to force Gould to fund pension benefits for the beneficiary former employees in full. The grievance proceeded to arbitration, and although the arbitrator held that Gould did not have to fund the plan in full, he found that Gould improperly changed its actuarial assumptions to reduce its contributions at the time it began to consider closing the plant.  The arbitrator ordered the parties to determine by negotiations the amount by which Gould's contributions were less than they would have been if proper actuarial assumptions had been used, and he directed Gould to pay that amount into the pension fund.  After negotiations, Gould and respondents' union agreed that the undercontribution amount was $570,600.  However, without notice to respondents, Gould and the union then negotiated a settlement.  Under the settlement, Gould agreed to guarantee full pension rights for the current retirees through a supplemental annuity, but Gould was absolved of the responsibility to deposit $570,600 with the plan's trustee, petitioner First Trust Co.  Vested employees were not entitled to any benefits under the settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondents, all vested employees, brought suit.  In their amended complaint, respondents for the first time alleged that Gould's failure to place the $570,600 in the trust violated the arbitrator's award, and thus the collective-bargaining agreement; and that in negotiating the settlement, their union breached its duty of fair representation.
