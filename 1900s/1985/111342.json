As for the definition of the \"not manifestly appropriate\" standard, which Wright contended was meaningless, the court instructed:  \"If you . . . find that the circumstances under which the weapon was possessed <i>could not be easily understood or recognized as being appropriate</i> to a lawful use of the instrument in question here then possession of the weapon . . . is prohibited.\"  <i>State v.

First, because      we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and      unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of      ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what      is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly.  Vague laws      may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning.  Second,      if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be      prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who      apply them.  A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to      policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an <i>ad hoc</i> and      subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and      discriminatory application\".  <i>Grayned v.

To impose criminal sanctions for the possession of objects simply because the authorities and a jury subsequently decide that the circumstances were not \"easily understood or recognized as being appropriate,\" <i>State v.

The result obviously is to create a scheme that \"furnishes a convenient tool for 'harsh and discriminatory enforcement by local prosecuting officials, against particular groups deemed to merit their displeasure.' \" <i>Papachristou v.

Wright, supra,</i> at 172, 475 A.2d, at 39.  Can there be any question that this sweeping standard places \"unfettered discretion\" in the hands of police, judges, and juries to carry out \"arbitrary and erratic arrests and convictions\"?  <i>Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, supra,</i> 405 U.S., at 162, 168, 92 S.Ct., at 843, 846.  Surely this law is unlikely to touch upon the \"pillars of the community,\" 405 U.S., at 163, 92 S.Ct., at 844, who are spotted with any of the multitude of potentially dangerous objects in circumstances that are not \"easily understood\" or \"recognized\" as \"appropriate.\"  See n. 3, <i>supra</i>.  Rather, there appears to be a grave danger that enforcement of the law will focus on the groups that historically have been the targets of vague legislation such as this&#8212;the poor, the minorities, the politically unpopular, and others who happen to be viewed with suspicion by the community's majority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence from &#167; 2C:39-5d of any requirement that the defendant <i>intend</i> to use the object in an unlawful manner accentuates the dangers discussed above.

Lee</i> advanced two arguments that might be invoked to suggest that Wright's challenge in the instant case is improper.  96 N.J., at 167, 475 A.2d, at 36.  First, it has frequently been stated that a criminal statute will not be struck down unless it is \"impermissibly vague in all its applications.\"  <i>Village of Hoffman Estates v. The Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,</i> 455 U.S. 489, 495, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 1191, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982).  A related doctrine stresses that a statute that might be impermissibly vague with respect to some conduct may not be challenged by one whose conduct quite clearly is prohibited by its terms.   <i>Id.,</i> at 495, n. 7, 102 S.Ct., at 1191, n. 7; <i>Parker v. Levy,</i> 417 U.S. 733, 756, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 2561, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For two reasons, these doctrines do not bar Wright's challenge.  First, we have emphasized that where a statute imposes criminal penalties the required standard of certainty is high, and a statute that does not satisfy this requirement may be invalidated on its face \"even where it could conceivably have . . . some valid application.\"  <i>Kolender v. Lawson,</i> 461 U.S., at 358-359, n. 8, 103 S.Ct., at 1859, n. 8.  See also <i>Colautti v. Franklin, supra,</i> 439 U.S., at 394-401, 99 S.Ct., at 685-688; <i>Lanzetta v. New Jersey,</i> 306 U.S. 451, 59 S.Ct. 618, 83 L.Ed.2d 888 (1939).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Second, the challenged statute must prescribe some coherent, ascertainable standard in the first instance.  Where the provision is vague \"not in the sense that it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard, but rather in the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all,\" it is unconstitutional.  <i>Coates v. City of Cincinnati,</i> 402 U.S. 611, 614, 91 S.Ct. 1686, 1688, 29 L.Ed.2d 214 (1971) (striking down statute proscribing public conduct \"annoying to persons passing by\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  As interpreted by the state courts, &#167; 2C:39-5d would seem surely to suffer from this fatal defect:  it \"simply has <i>no</i> core.  This absence of any ascertainable standard for inclusion and exclusion is precisely what offends the Due Process Clause.\"  <i>Smith v. Goguen,</i> 415 U.S., at 578, 94 S.Ct., at 1249 (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]his is not a case where further precision in the statutory language is either impossible or impractical.\"  <i>Kolender v. Lawson, supra,</i> 461 U.S., at 361, 103 S.Ct., at 1860.  First, the legislature may proscribe altogether the possession of certain items or the possession of such items in specified circumstances. This it has done in other contexts.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> N.J.Stat.Ann. &#167; 2C:39-3 (West 1982).  Second, it may prohibit the possession of any item capable of use as a weapon where the possession is actually for the purpose of unlawful use.  This, too, it has done. See, <i>e.g.,</i> &#167; 2C:39-4d (\"Any person who has in his possession any weapon . . . with a purpose to use it unlawfully against the person or property of another is guilty of a crime of the third degree\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  And it may of course prescribe the full \"range of nonpenal alternatives to . . . criminal sanctions.\"  <i>United States v.

See n. 2, <i>supra</i>.  As important as this goal is, however, \"it cannot justify legislation that would otherwise fail to meet constitutional standards for definiteness and clarity.\"   <i>Kolender v. Lawson, supra,</i> 461 U.S., at 361, 103 S.Ct., at 1860.  Because I believe there is a serious question whether the imposition of criminal liability for conduct that \"could not be easily understood or recognized as being appropriate\" intolerably crosses the constitutional line, I respectfully dissent from the Court's dismissal of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice POWELL took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This section provides in its entirety:  \"Any person who knowingly has in his possession any other weapon under circumstances not manifestly appropriate for such lawful uses as it may have is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree.\"</p>\n        <p>New Jersey Stat.Ann. &#167; 2C:39-1r (West 1982) in turn defines \"weapon\" as \"anything readily capable of lethal use or of inflicting serious bodily injury.

The obvious intent of the Legislature was to address a serious societal problem, the threat of harm to others from the possession of objects that can be used as weapons under circumstances not manifestly appropriate for such lawful uses as those objects may have.  Some objects that may be used as weapons also have more innocent purposes.  For example, a machete can be a lethal weapon or a useful device for deep sea fishing. . . .  A steak knife is appropriate at the dinner table, but sinister when concealed in a car with a BB gun. . . .</p>\n        <p>\"The underlying problem is protecting citizens from the threat of harm while permitting the use of objects such as knives in a manner consistent with a free and civilized society.  The statute addresses the problem by outlawing the possession of various weapons in circumstances where they pose a likely threat of harm to others.

A 'weapon' could include a brick, a baseball bat, a hammer, a broken bottle, a fishing knife, barbed wire, a knitting needle, a sharpened pencil, a riding crop, a jagged can, rope, a screwdriver, an ice pick, a tire iron, garden shears, a pitch fork, a shovel, a length of chain, a penknife, a fork, metal pipe, a stick, etc.  The foregoing only illustrate the variety of lawful objects which are often innocently possessed without wrongful intent, but under circumstances which are clearly not 'manifestly appropriate' for their lawful use.</p>\n        <p>\"Possession of a fork is manifestly appropriate only at the dinner table, of a bat on the athletic field, of a shovel in the garden.\"  188 N.J.Super. 432, 437, 457 A.2d 1184, 1187 (1982).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The Court has long emphasized the importance of providing minimal guidance.

Second, it may prohibit the possession of any item capable of use as a weapon where the possession is actually for the purpose of unlawful use.  This, too, it has done. See, <i>e.g.,</i> &#167; 2C:39-4d (\"Any person who has in his possession any weapon . . . with a purpose to use it unlawfully against the person or property of another is guilty of a crime of the third degree\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  And it may of course prescribe the full \"range of nonpenal alternatives to . . . criminal sanctions.\"  <i>United States v.

The obvious intent of the Legislature was to address a serious societal problem, the threat of harm to others from the possession of objects that can be used as weapons under circumstances not manifestly appropriate for such lawful uses as those objects may have.  Some objects that may be used as weapons also have more innocent purposes.  For example, a machete can be a lethal weapon or a useful device for deep sea fishing. . . .  A steak knife is appropriate at the dinner table, but sinister when concealed in a car with a BB gun. . . .</p>\n        <p>\"The underlying problem is protecting citizens from the threat of harm while permitting the use of objects such as knives in a manner consistent with a free and civilized society.  The statute addresses the problem by outlawing the possession of various weapons in circumstances where they pose a likely threat of harm to others.  In striking a balance, the Legislature recognized that an otherwise innocent object can become such a threat.\"  96 N.J., at 161-162, 475 A.2d, at 33-34.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> As Judge Antell, dissenting from the judgment of the Appellate Division in <i>State v.

The workman carrying home a linoleum knife earlier used in his work;  the paring knife inadvertently left on an automobile floor after being used for a lawful purpose;  a stevedore's hook or a fisherman's gaff thrown into a vehicle and forgotten.  A 'weapon' could include a brick, a baseball bat, a hammer, a broken bottle, a fishing knife, barbed wire, a knitting needle, a sharpened pencil, a riding crop, a jagged can, rope, a screwdriver, an ice pick, a tire iron, garden shears, a pitch fork, a shovel, a length of chain, a penknife, a fork, metal pipe, a stick, etc.  The foregoing only illustrate the variety of lawful objects which are often innocently possessed without wrongful intent, but under circumstances which are clearly not 'manifestly appropriate' for their lawful use.</p>\n        <p>\"Possession of a fork is manifestly appropriate only at the dinner table, of a bat on the athletic field, of a shovel in the garden.\"  188 N.J.Super. 432, 437, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></span>, 1187 (1982).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The Court has long emphasized the importance of providing minimal guidance.
