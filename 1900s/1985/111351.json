The order holds the Administrator in contempt for failing to promulgate certain emission standards for radionuclides as required by an earlier District Court order.  The controversy has reached this point due to a disagreement between the District Court and the agency over the construction of &#167; 112(b)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act, as added, 84 Stat. 1685, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 7412(b)(1)(B), which governs the actions the agency must take with respect to establishing emission standards for hazardous air pollutants.  Essentially, the District Court reads the section to require the EPA either to promulgate emission standards for all sources of the pollutant previously identified by the agency or to make a specific finding that the pollutant \"is not a hazardous air pollutant\";  the agency believes that under the section it may establish standards for some sources but not for others.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applicants seek the unusual relief of a stay from this Court pending appeal to a Court of Appeals.
