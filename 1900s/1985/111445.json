See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-16(c).  Choosing the latter route, petitioner filed this suit on October 29, 1982, the day before the 30-day limit expired.  She did not serve copies of the complaint on the United States Attorney or the Attorney General until January 1983, and did not serve the Postmaster General until February.  The record does not indicate when or if the Postal Service, which was the named defendant, was served, but it was not within the 30-day period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court dismissed the complaint because it did not name the proper defendant, who was the Postmaster General.  &#167; 2000e-16(c).

Therefore, petitioner's action was necessarily time-barred unless the amendment could relate back to the date of the original complaint.

In light of the Court of Appeals' firm stance on the 30-day requirement and its view that petitioner's claim \"must be barred\" unless the amendment related back, I believe the issue is presented here.

The argument in favor of such a grace period for service of process is appealing when the statute of limitations is as short as 30 days.
