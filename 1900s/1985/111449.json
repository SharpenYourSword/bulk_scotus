In contrast, courts adopting the \"arbitrary and capricious\" test have emphasized that the decision not to prepare an EIS is one committed to the agency's discretion<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>, and that application of a more deferential standard \"permits the agencies to have some leeway in applying the law to factual contexts in which they possess expertise.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The Court of Appeals did not state in this case that it would have reached the same result under a \"reasonableness\" standard,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and it is not for us to say what conclusions it might have drawn had it applied different considerations to these facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower courts have long been in disarray on what standard of review to apply to an agency's decision not to undertake an EIS.

If such an effect is anticipated, a more detailed \"environmental impact statement\" is required under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 4332(2)(C).

But the lower courts that have wrestled with the question of what rule to adopt clearly have not viewed the issue as one that might be settled by the flip of a coin.  Courts that have chosen the \"reasonableness\" standard have relied on the importance of \"the basic jurisdictional-type conclusion involved,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> or on the \"mandatory nature\" of the statute's language.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In settling on this more stringent rule, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit expressed the concern that \"[t]he spirit of the Act would die aborning if a facile, ex parte decision that the project was minor or did not significantly affect environment were too well shielded from impartial review.\" <i>Save Our Ten Acres, supra,</i> 472 F.2d, at 466.  In contrast, courts adopting the \"arbitrary and capricious\" test have emphasized that the decision not to prepare an EIS is one committed to the agency's discretion<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>, and that application of a more deferential standard \"permits the agencies to have some leeway in applying the law to factual contexts in which they possess expertise.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The Court of Appeals did not state in this case that it would have reached the same result under a \"reasonableness\" standard,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and it is not for us to say what conclusions it might have drawn had it applied different considerations to these facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower courts have long been in disarray on what standard of review to apply to an agency's decision not to undertake an EIS.
