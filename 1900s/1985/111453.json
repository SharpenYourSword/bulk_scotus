On January 12, after the 6-month period had run, he served a copy of the complaint on Kroger;  and on January 25 he served the union.  Applying <i>DelCostello,</i> and relying on the plain words of &#167; 10(b), the District Court granted both defendants' motions for summary judgment on the ground that the action was time-barred.

While the time for service of process is not open-ended, see Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. 4(a), 4(j), it need not occur within the limitations period.  Ordinary federal practice thus conflicts with the specific terms of this borrowed statute of limitations.  In light of this inconsistency, the brevity of the limitations period, and the fact that &#167; 10(b) was not intended to apply to judicial proceedings, the result below is not obviously correct.  In practical effect, the Eleventh Circuit's ruling shortens the 6-month period by the amount of time necessary to effect service under the Federal Rules.  Section 10(b) does not have a similar impact in administrative proceedings, in which service is accomplished merely by placing a copy of the charge in the mail.
