There was no question as to whether petitioner could meet the requirement of \"malice\" under <i>New York Times Co. v.

The Court of Appeals majority relied upon a brief passage from our opinion in <i>Gertz v.

I think that the result reached by the Court of Appeals in this case is nothing less than extraordinary.  At the heart of the common law of defamation were a few areas of expression which even when spoken rather than written were regarded as so damaging as to be classified as \"slander <i>per se</i> \" and therefore not to require the proof of any special damages in order to allow recovery.  One of these categories consists of statements which defame the plaintiff in connection with his business or occupation.  See, <i>e.g., November v. Time, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></span> (1963);  <i>Stevens v.

But for nationally syndicated columnists to quote an unnamed political scientist as saying that petitioner has \"no status within the profession\" is far more than the mere statements of opinion traditionally protected by qualified privilege under the common law of libel.  Doctors who are disapproved of by other doctors may find solace in the fees paid by their patients;  lawyers disapproved of by other lawyers may comfort themselves by the retainers paid by their clients. But the academic who is disapproved of by his peers has no such healthy recourse outside of the profession.

I continue to believe that is the correct meaning of the quoted passage.  But it is apparent from the cases cited by petitioner that lower courts have seized upon the word \"opinion\" in the second sentence to solve with a meat axe a very subtle and difficult question, totally oblivious \"of the rich and complex history of the struggle of the common law to deal with this problem.\"  Hill, Defamation and Privacy Under the First Amendment, 76 Colum.L.Rev. 1205, 1239 (1976).</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scholarly treatment of this subject by the various opinions in the Court of Appeals comprises 148 pages in the appendix to the petition for certiorari in this case.  Obviously the passage from <i>Gertz</i> quoted above has led the majority of that court to the conclusion that respondents' article is not actionable as a matter of law.  But if one draws back for a moment, and considers the passage in context and in the light both of the First Amendment and the history of common-law libel, see R. Sack, Libel, Slander and Related Problems 158 (1980), I find it impossible to disagree with Judge Wald's characterization:</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]he columnists' statement that 'Ollman has no status      within the profession, but is a pure and simple activist' is      an assertion of fact for which its authors can be made to      answer, consistent with the requirements of the [F]irst      [A]mendment, in a suit for libel.\"  242 U.S.App.D.C., at 363,      750 F.2d, at 1032.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would grant the petition for certiorari in this case.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    ",
