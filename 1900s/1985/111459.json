The section also contained a residual clause forbidding anyone to obstruct or attempt to obstruct the \"due administration of justice.\"  In 1982, Congress amended &#167; 1503 to remove all references to witnesses.  At the same time, it enacted the Victim and Witness Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512, addressed specifically to protecting witnesses, informants, and crime victims from harassment and intimidation.

The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected this contention and affirmed petitioners' convictions under &#167; 1503, reasoning that certain kinds of witness tampering could still be reached under the provision's \"obstruction of justice\" clause.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"444585\"><a href=\"/opinion/444585/united-states-v-oscar-w-wesley-and-velma-cooper/\"><span class=\"volume\">748</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">962</span></a></span> (5 Cir.1984).  The court observed that &#167; 1512 did not proscribe \"urging and advising\" a witness to testify falsely, which was the conduct that was charged to have violated &#167; 1503 in these cases.  If urging a witness to commit perjury was not prohibited by &#167; 1512, and if witnesses had been removed entirely from the scope of &#167; 1503, the conduct with which petitioners were charged would violate neither section.
