The court placed primary emphasis on those provisions of the Act that establish the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1342, under which minimum federal standards regulating the discharge of pollutants may be supplanted by more stringent state standards.  These provisions of the Clean Water Act, however, are of extremely limited relevance to the questions posed by this case, as federal regulations specifically exempt from the NPDES program discharges from vessels incident to their normal operation.  40 CFR &#167; 122.3(a) (1984).
