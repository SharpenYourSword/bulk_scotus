Rather, the prosecutor's argument urged the jury \"to minimize the importance of its role,\" 472 U.S., at 333, 105 S.Ct., at 2642, with statements that were both improper under <i>Caldwell</i> and factually inaccurate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Louisiana Supreme Court acknowledged that the prosecutor's remarks were \"troublesome,\" 464 So.2d, at 266, it concluded that the jury was not misled.

In this situation, one cannot possibly conclude that the improper argument \"had no effect on the sentencing decision,\" <i>Caldwell, supra,</i> 472 U.S., at 341, 105 S.Ct., at 2646.
