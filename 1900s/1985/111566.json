However, even were I to believe that the death penalty could constitutionally be imposed under certain circumstances and that a jury decision for life could be accorded mere advisory status, I would grant certiorari in this case to decide whether the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the State from forcing a defendant to face a second sentencing jury even though the presumptive validity of his first jury's life recommendation has never been overcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Petitioner Robert Patten was convicted of first-degree murder, and the State sought the death penalty.

The court consequently found the giving of the <i>Allen</i> charge improper and vacated the death sentence.  At this point, though, rather than instructing the trial judge to determine whether it would be appropriate to enter a death sentence regardless of the jury's action, the court chose to remand the case to the trial court for a new sentencing proceeding before a jury.

See <i>Spaziano v. Florida, supra.</i> Yet the defendant who has persuaded a jury to reject the State's claim that he deserves to die has nonetheless won a significant victory, for Florida has severely limited the trial judge's power to override a life recommendation.  In <i>Tedder v. State,</i> 322 So.2d 908 (1975), the Florida Supreme Court held an override to be appropriate only where the \"facts suggesting a sentence of death [are] so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 910;  accord, <i>Odom v.

Thus, while the life recommendation of a Florida jury does not have the conclusive effect of the Missouri jury's decision for life that was considered in <i>Bullington,</i> the recommendation is presumed final, subject to reversal only where \"virtually no reasonable person could differ.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because a Florida jury's life recommendation is not completely final, this Court has held that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the judge's override of a jury's life recommendation.  <i>Spaziano v. Florida, supra.</i>  However, where a defendant is deprived of the benefits of a jury's life recommendation without any subsequent finding by the trial judge that that recommendation was \"clear[ly] and convincing[ly]\" unreasonable, I believe there to be a double jeopardy bar to the State's demand that the defendant convince yet another jury that he does not deserve to die.  If not held unreasonable, a jury's life recommendation should end a Florida defendant's jeopardy as surely as a life verdict ended that of the Missouri defendant in <i>Bullington.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner was deprived of a jury's life recommendation without any court having found that advisory verdict unreasonable. Under Florida law, a 6-to-6 vote is a life recommendation.  See <i>Rose v. State, supra,</i> at 525.  When the trial judge received the jury's note indicating that it was deadlocked 6 to 6, there was therefore nothing left for him to do but recall the jury and apply the <i>Tedder</i> standard to its life recommendation.  I can scarcely believe that the trial judge would have overridden such a recommendation in this case;  had he done so, he doubtless would have been reversed on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  But instead, the trial judge altered the verdict by giving an <i>Allen</i> charge.  Then, even while holding the judge to have erred in giving the charge, the Florida Supreme Court proceeded to disregard the fact that the jury's deadlock was a finding for defendant on the issue of death.  The Supreme Court's decision to remand was not based upon any finding that a life sentence was unreasonable.  The Supreme Court remanded only because the jury's report of a 6-to-6 deadlock had not been contained in a formal recommendation.  Since I do not believe that this adherence to formalism is consistent with the double jeopardy concerns implicated by the Supreme Court's demand that petitioner convince yet another jury that he does not deserve to die, I must dissent from this Court's refusal to hear this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>Allen v.
