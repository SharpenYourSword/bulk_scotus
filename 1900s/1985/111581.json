For his part in a large-scale narcotics distribution scheme, petitioner Adams was convicted of both the substantive RICO offense defined by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> and conspiracy to commit this offense. Petitioner requested a jury instruction that he could not be found guilty on the conspiracy count unless the evidence showed that he had personally agreed to commit two acts of racketeering activity. The District Judge refused this instruction.  In affirming petitioner's RICO conspiracy conviction, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that, to be convicted of conspiracy to violate &#167; 1962(c), a defendant need only agree to the commission of two predicate acts of racketeering activity, and need not agree to personally commit those acts.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450731\"><a href=\"/opinion/450731/united-states-v-adams-tyrone-in-no-84-5455-united-/\"><span class=\"volume\">759</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1099</span></a></span>, 1116 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Courts of Appeals disagree as to the proper interpretation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(d), the RICO conspiracy statute.
