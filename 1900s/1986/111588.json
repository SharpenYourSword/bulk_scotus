Instead, it criminalizes nonobscene nudity in any public place so long as its purpose is to gratify the sexual desires of another person.  Arkansas thus cannot rely on the Twenty-first Amendment as a sufficient basis to justify its statute, and instead, must demonstrate a compelling state interest sufficient to prohibit the exercise of a protected form of expression.
