The present case presents the question of what to do when more than one state statute of limitations applies to personal injury actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondent in this case is an Alabama farmer who brought a &#167; 1983 action against petitioners for allegedly violating his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights by causing his equipment to be seized pursuant to prejudgment attachment writs that petitioners obtained without notice or a hearing.  The only significant issue on appeal was the appropriate statute of limitations to borrow from the Alabama Code.  763 F.2d 1250 (CA11 1985).  The Eleventh Circuit explained that its task of applying <i>Wilson v. Garcia, supra,</i> was complicated by the fact that Alabama has not one but two personal injury statutes of limitations. Alabama Code &#167; 6-2-34(1) (1975) governs actions for \"any trespass to person or liberty, such as false imprisonment or assault and battery,\" and has been interpreted by the Alabama courts as applying to actions for trespass.  Alabama Code &#167; 6-2-39(a)(5) (1975) governs \"[a]ctions for any injury to the person or rights of another not arising from contract and not specifically enumerated in this section,\" and has been interpreted by the Alabama courts as applying to actions for trespass on the case. The Eleventh Circuit resolved its seeming dilemma in applying <i>Wilson v. Garcia</i> by reasoning that while not all &#167; 1983 actions involve trespass, trespass is \"the particular type of wrong that was most paradigmatic, the one category of wrongs that the legislators [who enacted &#167; 1983] intended first and foremost to address.\"  763 F.2d, at 1255.  Accordingly, the court held that the 6-year statute of limitations provided by &#167; 6-2-34(1), rather than the then 1-year statute of limitations provided by &#167; 6-2-39(a)(5), should govern &#167; 1983 actions in Alabama.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eleventh Circuit's decision in this case conflicts with three en banc decisions by the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, all of which were companion cases to the decision we affirmed in <i>Wilson v.

Hammock,</i> 730 F.2d 1367, 1370 (1984) (en banc), a case in which certiorari was not sought, the Tenth Circuit noted that Colorado had distinct statutes of limitations for actions for trespass (one year) and trespass on the case (six years), and, finding the distinction between trespass and trespass on the case irrelevant to &#167; 1983, opted instead to use the residuary 3-year period for \" '[a]ll other actions of every kind for which no other period of limitation is provided by law.' \"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the foregoing cases demonstrate, the Tenth Circuit finds it inappropriate to borrow for &#167; 1983 purposes a statute of limitations governing common-law trespasses, preferring instead to look for a statute more compatible with its characterization of a &#167; 1983 action as \"in essence an action for injury to personal rights.\"  <i>Garcia v.
