McCree,</i> No. 84-1865. Applicant has raised a claim that would be directly affected by the decision in <i>McCree.</i>  Although no prospective juror in this case was actually stricken because of expressed scruples against the death penalty, applicant alleges that the jurors' exposure to <i>voir dire</i> on their willingness to inflict the death penalty rendered them more likely to convict him.  This is identical to a claim at issue in <i>McCree.</i>  It is also identical to claims raised in <i>James v. Wainwright,</i> 475 U.S. 1074, 106 S.Ct. 1393, 89 L.Ed.2d 707, and <i>Adams v. Wainwright,</i> 475 U.S. 1062, 106 S.Ct. 1371, 89 L.Ed.2d 598, both of which were stayed by this Court, the former only hours ago.  James, like applicant, relied solely on the jurors' exposure to death qualification;  he nowhere claimed that the exclusion of jurors via peremptory strikes brought his case within the scope of <i>McCree.</i>  See Pet. for Cert. in No. 85-6545, pp. 6-13.  Although this Court has deferred consideration of numerous other petitions for certiorari pending our decision in <i>McCree,</i> and has issued stays of execution where necessary to permit this deferral, the Court inexplicably refuses to treat the case before us as we have treated these others.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More alarming is the Court's disregard of its own procedures in this case.  Because at least three Justices have voted to defer consideration of the petition pending <i>McCree,</i> the Court has not, nor under its own procedures can it, dispose of the petition for certiorari.  Thus, applicant is in the unusual and manifestly unfair position of facing execution before this Court has considered his petition.  This Court has shown a bizarre willingness to ignore standard procedures as it pleases in order to bring about speedy executions.  I can only lament this Court's own special contribution to the arbitrariness and freakishness that continues to characterize the implementation of the death penalty.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice BLACKMUN joins, dissenting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the Court has not yet acted on the petition for a writ of certiorari, I would stay applicant's execution until that petition is decided.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "", "html_with_citations": "<p class=\"case_cite\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1074</span></span></p>\n    <p class=\"case_cite\">106 S.Ct. 1392</p>\n    <p class=\"case_cite\">89 L.Ed.2d 707</p>\n    <p class=\"parties\">Roy Allen HARICH<br>v.<br>Louie L.
