The Oregon Supreme Court espouses yet a third view, stating that the touchstone of the \"in custody\" determination is whether \"the officer should be aware that the totality of circumstances in which the interrogation takes place is such that the person questioned would reasonably believe he is not free to leave.\"   <i>State v.

In <i>Miranda,</i> the Court stated that \"[b]y custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\"  <i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1612, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).  As the trial court found, in this case there is no indication that the questioning took place in a context where respondent's freedom was restricted in any significant way.  Respondent voluntarily accompanied the officers.  He never asked to leave.  The police never told him that he was not free to leave, never used any physical restraint of any kind, never threatened him, never confronted him with any incriminating evidence, and dropped him off at home at the end of the trip.  Respondent was not being coerced by the \"inherently compelling pressures\" of a custodial setting.  See <i>Miranda, supra,</i> at 467, 86 S.Ct., at 1624.  As he testified in the suppression hearing, he took police on the long road trip \"to keep them off [his] track.\"  It was he, and not the police, who exploited the situation. Respondent may have therefore unwisely placed himself in an uncomfortable position, but no more so than a suspect who voluntarily comes to the police station for questioning, see <i>Beckwith, supra;  Oregon v. Mathiason,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109587\"><a href=\"/opinion/109587/oregon-v-mathiason/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 97 S.Ct. 711, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977), or a motorist who is involuntarily detained for questioning concerning a traffic violation.
