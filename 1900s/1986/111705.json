Since our decision in that case, the Courts of Appeals have differed on whether <i>Wilson</i> should be given retroactive effect.  In the present case, the Sixth Circuit held, without qualification, that <i>Wilson</i> should be given retroactive effect.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"461044\"><a href=\"/opinion/461044/linda-mulligan-v-francis-hazard/\"><span class=\"volume\">777</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">340</span></a></span> (CA6 1985).

The Eleventh Circuit in <i>Jones v. Preuit &amp; Mauldin, supra,</i> the Fifth Circuit in <i>Gates v.
