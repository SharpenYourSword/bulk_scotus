That court, while admitting that the prosecutor's argument was \"close to reversible error,\" <i>ibid.,</i> concluded that the argument had not diminished the jury's sense of responsibility for its sentencing decision.  The Fifth Circuit, reviewing the District Court's rejection of the same claim in petitioner's first federal habeas petition, reached the same conclusion.  <i>Moore v.

Subsequently, this Court decided <i>Caldwell,</i> and petitioner filed a second habeas petition claiming that the prosecutor's argument violated the Eighth Amendment as construed in our decision in that case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court denied this petition, and the Court of Appeals denied a certificate of probable cause.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"458905\"><a href=\"/opinion/458905/alvin-r-moore-jr-v-frank-blackburn-warden-louisian/\"><span class=\"volume\">774</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span> (CA5 1985).  The latter court held that the <i>Caldwell</i> claim had been raised in petitioner's first application, and was therefore barred by Rule 9(b) of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases, and by the principles enunciated in <i>Sanders v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106591\"><a href=\"/opinion/106591/sanders-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963).  The court also concluded that its prior determination that the prosecutor's argument had not diminished the jury's sense of responsibility, see 740 F.2d, at 320, was \"consistent with the rule set forth in <i>Caldwell.</i>\"  774 F.2d, at 98.  Even had the <i>Caldwell</i> claim not been raised previously, the court held, it would have denied that claim as an abuse of the writ, because a competent lawyer would have been aware of the possibility of such a claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court of Appeals was mistaken in believing that its prior pronouncement that the jury's sense of responsibility was not diminished disposed of the <i>Caldwell</i> claim.  The prosecutor's argument in this case is essentially identical to the argument held unconstitutional in <i>Caldwell.</i>  The lesson of <i>Caldwell,</i> at a minimum, is that a misleading or incomplete statement concerning appellate review of a death sentence <i>necessarily</i> diminishes the jury's sense of responsibility.  In the present case, no less than in <i>Caldwell,</i> the jury may have \"harbor[ed] misconceptions about the power of state appellate courts or, for that matter, <i>this</i> Court to override a jury's sentence of death.\"  472 U.S., at 342, 105 S.Ct., at 2646 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Under those circumstances, we cannot be confident that the jury did not conclude that the ultimate responsibility for petitioner's fate rested elsewhere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case, then, falls squarely within the \"ends of justice\" exception to the general rule forbidding successive assertions of the same claim on habeas, see <i>Sanders, supra,</i> at 16-17, 83 S.Ct., at 1077-1078.  In <i>Sanders,</i> this Court held that \"[i]f purely legal questions are involved, the applicant may be entitled to a new hearing upon showing an intervening change in the law.\"  373 U.S., at 17, 83 S.Ct., at 1078.  <i>Caldwell</i> constitutes an intervening change in the law concerning the precise argument used by the prosecutor in this case&#8212;a change that requires reexamination of the Court of Appeals' earlier conclusion about the effect of that argument on the jury.  The clear import of <i>Sanders</i> is that petitioner is entitled to present his claim to the federal courts, and I therefore dissent from the denial of certiorari.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
