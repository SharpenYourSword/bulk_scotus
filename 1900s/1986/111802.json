First, the Florida court improperly based its enumeration of tainted testimony on <i>Anderson's own testimony at trial.</i> App. to Pet. for Cert. 86a-87a.  Anderson's own assessment of the impact of hypnosis on his recollection was inherently unreliable and was not subject to effective cross-examination, for the very reasons the court relied upon in holding that such evidence would in future be inadmissible.  The hypnotically refreshed \"recollection\" of the precise date of his observation is the most glaring omission from Anderson's list.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Having identified constitutional error in the admission of hypnotically refreshed testimony, the Florida Supreme Court was not free to excise a fraction of that evidence and conclude that the rest could not have contributed to the conviction.  Second, the Florida court evidently confused review for harmless constitutional error with review for sufficiency of the evidence, despite this Court's explanation of the difference in <i>Fahy:</i>  \"[w]e are not concerned here with whether there was sufficient evidence on which the petitioner could have been convicted without the evidence complained of.  The question is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\"  <i>Id.</i> 375 U.S., at 86-87, 84 S.Ct., at 230.

Because the Florida Supreme Court misapplied the harmless constitutional error rule in such a way as to place in doubt the reliability of a verdict in a capital case, I would grant the petition for certiorari.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> One of petitioner's experts testified at the pre-trial suppression hearing that Anderson's testimony was \"enhanced\" by numerous details in addition to the date of the occurrence and the three items listed by Anderson.  These enhancements included what Anderson was doing on that day, the man's weight, the fact that he was clean-shaven, the description of the van and the fact that he could see the man and the girl through its rear window.

California,</i> 386 U.S. 18, 23, 87 S.Ct. 824, 827-28, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967) (same).  When the evidence admitted at petitioner's trial is reviewed in this light it becomes clear that the tainted testimony significantly bolstered the State's case against him, for the untainted evidence was far from overwhelming.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We must recognize that harmless-error rules can work very unfair and mischievous results when, for example, highly important and persuasive evidence . . . though legally forbidden, finds its way into a trial in which the question of guilt or innocence is a close one.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 22, 87 S.Ct. at 827.  Because the Florida Supreme Court misapplied the harmless constitutional error rule in such a way as to place in doubt the reliability of a verdict in a capital case, I would grant the petition for certiorari.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> One of petitioner's experts testified at the pre-trial suppression hearing that Anderson's testimony was \"enhanced\" by numerous details in addition to the date of the occurrence and the three items listed by Anderson.  These enhancements included what Anderson was doing on that day, the man's weight, the fact that he was clean-shaven, the description of the van and the fact that he could see the man and the girl through its rear window.  Pet. for Cert. at 12.  The court below evidently ignored this portion of the record in reaching its conclusion as to harmless error.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Since the Florida Supreme Court found constitutional error and the State has not cross-petitioned for certiorari on that question, this Court is not called upon to decide whether admission of hypnotically refreshed testimony in a criminal trial violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.  Accordingly, I express no view on this question.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
