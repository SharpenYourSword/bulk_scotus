However, even if I believed that the death penalty could be imposed constitutionally under certain circumstances, I nevertheless would grant certiorari because the petitioner presents strong evidence that the state used its peremptory challenges in this case to exclude jurors that it was forbidden to excuse for cause under <i>Witherspoon v.

Exclusion of such jurors, we said, denies a capital defendant the right to sentencing by an impartial jury that is representative of the community, for it \"produce[s] a jury uncommonly willing to condemn a man to die.\"  391 U.S., at 521, 88 S.Ct. at 1776.  We underscored the importance of this right in <i>Adams v. Texas,</i> 448 U.S. 38, 100 S.Ct. 2521, 65 L.Ed.2d 581 (1980), which held unconstitutional the exclusion of jurors who acknowledged that their concerns about capital punishment might affect their ability to find facts that would lead to its automatic imposition.

At voir dire, the prosecutor had sought to determine not merely if prospective jurors had any scruples about the death penalty that might impair their performance, but if they had any scruples about it at all.  The prosecutor was remarkably candid about this objective in addressing the venire at the start of voir dire:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We want to know if you do in fact believe in capital      punishment, not wavering.

It maintains, however, that since it used peremptory challenges to accomplish this end, its conduct is immune from scrutiny.  The State reads our recent decision in <i>Batson v. Kentucky,</i> --- U.S. ----, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), as significant only in that it proscribes racially discriminatory peremptory challenges.  It insists that, since the challenges were exercised in this case in a racially neutral manner, they are free from constitutional infirmity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The implication of the State's position is that it is free to use its peremptory challenges to violate any constitutional command other than the Equal Protection Clause.  The state, however, misses the wider significance of <i>Batson:</i>  that the broad discretion afforded prosecutors in the exercise of peremptory challenges may not be abused to accomplish <i>any</i> unconstitutional end.  In <i>Batson,</i> we said that \"counsel's effort to obtain <i>possibly relevant</i> information about prospective jurors is to be distinguished from the practice at issue here.\"  --- U.S. ----, at ----, n. 12, 106 S.Ct. 1712, at 1718, n. 12 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice O'CONNOR's concurrence observes that, as an unfortunate matter of <i>fact,</i> race may be relevant in that it may actually influence a juror's decision.  The concurrence correctly notes that such factual relevance is insufficient to justify the exercise of a peremptory challenge on the basis of a juror's race, because race has been deemed irrelevant as a matter of <i>law.</i>  The concurrence, however, fails to recognize that precisely the same situation obtains with respect to scruples about the death penalty.  Such scruples may be relevant as a matter of <i>fact.</i> Nonetheless, that is insufficient to justify the use of peremptory challenges to exclude jurors with such scruples, for <i>Witherspoon</i> and <i>Adams</i> make clear that this characteristic is irrelevant as a matter of <i>law.</i>  It does not the minimize the tragic history of race discrimination in this country to insist that we enforce the <i>Witherspoon</i> proscription just as faithfully as that forbidding reliance on race, for we may not pick and choose which constitutional rights we will and will not vindicate in monitoring the jury selection process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Peremptory challenges may be used for reasons that may not comport completely with rational analysis, or that may resist coherent articulation.  Such latitude has for practical reasons required a presumption that these challenges are exercised in a constitutionally responsible fashion.  As <i>Batson</i> makes clear, however, that presumption is rebuttable.  In this case, the Court is presented with evidence from the voir dire that plainly indicates that the prosecutor used its peremptory challenges to obtain the \"hanging jury,\" <i>Witherspoon,</i> 391 U.S. at 523, 88 S.Ct. at 1777, that he could not obtain through challenges for cause. We therefore cannot maintain the usual presumption that these challenges were properly used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agents of the State enjoy considerable discretion in performing certain functions within the criminal justice system. With great discretion, however, comes great responsibility.  When a court has evidence that the state has not lived up to that responsibility, its refusal to intervene converts discretion into a license for constitutional violation.  For this reason, I would grant the petition for certiorari in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "", "html_with_citations": "<p class=\"case_cite\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">940</span></span></p>\n    <p class=\"case_cite\">107 S.Ct. 423</p>\n    <p class=\"case_cite\">93 L.Ed.2d 373</p>\n    <p class=\"parties\">David J.

Illinois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107715\"><a href=\"/opinion/107715/witherspoon-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span>, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Witherspoon,</i> this Court held that, in a capital case, the prosecution may not exclude for cause those jurors who indicate that they have scruples about the death penalty, but who nonetheless state that such beliefs would not prevent them from performing their duties as jurors according to law.  Exclusion of such jurors, we said, denies a capital defendant the right to sentencing by an impartial jury that is representative of the community, for it \"produce[s] a jury uncommonly willing to condemn a man to die.\"  391 U.S., at 521, 88 S.Ct. at 1776.  We underscored the importance of this right in <i>Adams v. Texas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110323\"><a href=\"/opinion/110323/adams-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 100 S.Ct. 2521, 65 L.Ed.2d 581 (1980), which held unconstitutional the exclusion of jurors who acknowledged that their concerns about capital punishment might affect their ability to find facts that would lead to its automatic imposition.  Texas could not, we said, bar jurors who stated that they would honestly find the relevant facts if convinced of their existence beyond a reasonable doubt,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"yet who frankly concede that the prospects of the death      penalty may affect what their honest judgment of the facts      will be or what they may deem to be a reasonable doubt.  Such      assessments and judgments by jurors are inherent in the jury      system, and to exclude all jurors who would be in the      slightest way affected by the prospect of the death penalty      or by their views about such a penalty would be to deprive      the defendant of the impartial jury to which he or she is      entitled under the law.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 50, 100 S.Ct. at 2528.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner in the case before us, David J. Brown, was convicted of the first-degree murder of two women and given two death sentences.  At voir dire, the prosecutor had sought to determine not merely if prospective jurors had any scruples about the death penalty that might impair their performance, but if they had any scruples about it at all.  The prosecutor was remarkably candid about this objective in addressing the venire at the start of voir dire:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We want to know if you do in fact believe in capital      punishment, not wavering.

Pet. at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State concedes that it could not have excused for cause those jurors failing the prosecutor's litmus test.  It maintains, however, that since it used peremptory challenges to accomplish this end, its conduct is immune from scrutiny.  The State reads our recent decision in <i>Batson v. Kentucky,</i> --- U.S. ----, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), as significant only in that it proscribes racially discriminatory peremptory challenges.  It insists that, since the challenges were exercised in this case in a racially neutral manner, they are free from constitutional infirmity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The implication of the State's position is that it is free to use its peremptory challenges to violate any constitutional command other than the Equal Protection Clause.  The state, however, misses the wider significance of <i>Batson:</i>  that the broad discretion afforded prosecutors in the exercise of peremptory challenges may not be abused to accomplish <i>any</i> unconstitutional end.  In <i>Batson,</i> we said that \"counsel's effort to obtain <i>possibly relevant</i> information about prospective jurors is to be distinguished from the practice at issue here.\"  --- U.S. ----, at ----, n. 12, 106 S.Ct. 1712, at 1718, n. 12 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice O'CONNOR's concurrence observes that, as an unfortunate matter of <i>fact,</i> race may be relevant in that it may actually influence a juror's decision.  The concurrence correctly notes that such factual relevance is insufficient to justify the exercise of a peremptory challenge on the basis of a juror's race, because race has been deemed irrelevant as a matter of <i>law.</i>  The concurrence, however, fails to recognize that precisely the same situation obtains with respect to scruples about the death penalty.  Such scruples may be relevant as a matter of <i>fact.</i> Nonetheless, that is insufficient to justify the use of peremptory challenges to exclude jurors with such scruples, for <i>Witherspoon</i> and <i>Adams</i> make clear that this characteristic is irrelevant as a matter of <i>law.</i>  It does not the minimize the tragic history of race discrimination in this country to insist that we enforce the <i>Witherspoon</i> proscription just as faithfully as that forbidding reliance on race, for we may not pick and choose which constitutional rights we will and will not vindicate in monitoring the jury selection process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Peremptory challenges may be used for reasons that may not comport completely with rational analysis, or that may resist coherent articulation.  Such latitude has for practical reasons required a presumption that these challenges are exercised in a constitutionally responsible fashion.  As <i>Batson</i> makes clear, however, that presumption is rebuttable.  In this case, the Court is presented with evidence from the voir dire that plainly indicates that the prosecutor used its peremptory challenges to obtain the \"hanging jury,\" <i>Witherspoon,</i> 391 U.S. at 523, 88 S.Ct. at 1777, that he could not obtain through challenges for cause. We therefore cannot maintain the usual presumption that these challenges were properly used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agents of the State enjoy considerable discretion in performing certain functions within the criminal justice system. With great discretion, however, comes great responsibility.  When a court has evidence that the state has not lived up to that responsibility, its refusal to intervene converts discretion into a license for constitutional violation.  For this reason, I would grant the petition for certiorari in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "id": 111808, "judges": "", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/111808/", "sha1": "e73c261d1572e2893f90c52b0283c232e51abab3", "source": "R", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T10:13:24"}
