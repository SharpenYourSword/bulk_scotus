The order sought would remain in effect until the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issues its final decision in the pending suit filed by the applicant against the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and, should the applicant be unsuccessful in that suit, until disposition of a petition for writ of certiorari in this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The application must be denied.  Section 2101(f) provides: \"In any case in which the <i>final</i> judgment or decree of any court is subject to review by the Supreme Court on writ of certiorari, the execution and enforcement of <i>such</i> judgment or decree may be stayed for a reasonable time to enable the party aggrieved to obtain a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court.\" (Emphasis added.)  It is clear from this language that, even though certiorari review of interlocutory orders of federal courts is available, see 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1254(1) and 1292, it is only the execution or enforcement of <i>final</i> orders that is stayable under &#167; 2101(f).  See <i>Twentieth Century Airlines Inc., v. Ryan,</i> 74 S.Ct. 8, 10, 98 L.Ed. 1143, 1145 (1953) (Reed, J., in chambers).  In this case, the only extant order which, if stayed, could conceivably affect the full-power operation of the Perry plant, is the Sixth Circuit's order of December 23, 1986, lifting the stay of full-power operation that it imposed on November 13, 1986.

A Circuit Justice's issuance of such a writ&#8212;which, unlike a &#167; 2101(f) stay, does not simply suspend judicial alteration of the status quo but grants judicial intervention that has been withheld by lower courts&#8212;demands a significantly higher justification than that described in the &#167; 2101(f) stay cases cited by the applicant, <i>e.g., Rostker v.

The Circuit Justice's injunctive power is to be used \" 'sparingly and only in the most critical and exigent circumstances,' \" <i>Fishman v.

Moreover, the applicant must demonstrate that the injunctive relief is \"necessary or appropriate in aid of [the Court's] jurisdictio[n].\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1651(a).
