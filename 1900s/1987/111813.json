Both cases present the same federal constitutional question;  I set forth the facts in <i>Martin County v. Makemson</i> only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondent Robert Makemson was appointed under Florida law to represent a defendant charged with first-degree murder, kidnaping, and armed robbery.  Respondent's representation of the defendant spanned a 9-month period, and upon completion of the task respondent petitioned the trial court, pursuant to Fla.Stat. &#167; 925.036 (1985),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> for attorney's fees in the amount of $9,500. Section 925.036(2)(d) establishes a limit of $3,500 on compensation to appointed attorneys who represent capital defendants at trial.  Notwithstanding this provision, the state trial court awarded respondent the $9,500 he requested, declaring that \" 'in setting rigid maximum fees without regard to the circumstances in each case[, &#167; 925.036] is arbitrary and capricious and violates the due process clause of the United States and Florida Constitutions.' \"  491 So.2d 1109, 1111 (1986). The Fourth District Court of Appeals quashed the trial court's order declaring &#167; 925.036 unconstitutional and certified several pertinent questions to the Florida Supreme Court.  464 So.2d 1281 (1985).  The Supreme Court held, <i>inter alia,</i> that the statute, while facially valid, was unconstitutional as applied to this case.  The court reasoned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[W]e find that the statutory maximum fees, as      inflexibly imposed in cases involving unusual or      extraordinary circumstances, interfere with the defendant's sixth amendment right      'to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.'  The      statute, as applied to many of today's cases, provides for      only token compensation.  The availability of effective      counsel is therefore called into question in those cases when      it is needed most.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">*          *          *          *          *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Section 925.036] interferes with the sixth amendment      right to counsel. . . .

Indeed, under our existing cases, I discern nothing in the Sixth Amendment that would prohibit a state from requiring its lawyers to represent indigent criminal defendants without <i>any</i> compensation for their services at all.  By my view, Florida had no Sixth Amendment duty to enact &#167; 925.036;  it follows <i>a fortiori</i> that the Sixth Amendment does not require the state or its political subdivisions to pay <i>more</i> than the limits established in that statute.  This view is consistent with our decision in <i>Powell v.

There, the Court held that a state trial court had a duty to assign counsel in a capital case where the defendant was unable to employ an attorney and was incapable of representing himself.  The Court asserted that \"[a]ttorneys are officers of the court, and are bound to render service when required by such an appointment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 73, 53 S.Ct. at 65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even were I not of this view, I would still vote to grant the petition for certiorari because the decisions in these cases conflict with the decisions of other courts.

The court assumed&#8212;perhaps gratuitously&#8212;that an attorney had standing to assert the Sixth Amendment right of his client, and stated that it knew \"of no data to support a claim that an assigned attorney fails or shirks in the least the full measure of any attorney's obligation to a client. . . .
