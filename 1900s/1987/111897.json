Petitioner raises a substantial claim that, since trial, he has become incompetent and therefore may not be executed.  In <i>Ford v. Wainwright,</i> 477 U.S. ----, 106 S.Ct. 2595, 91 L.Ed.2d 335 (1986), the Court held that the Eighth Amendment bars execution of convicted prisoners found to be incompetent.  The Court rested its holding on the lack of \"retributive value [in] executing a person who has no comprehension of why he has been singled out and stripped of his fundamental right to life.\"  <i>Id.,</i> 106 S.Ct. at 2602.  The Court also relied on \"the natural abhorrence civilized societies feel at killing one who has no capacity to come to grips with his own conscience or deity.\"  <i>Ibid.</i>  In a concurring opinion, Justice POWELL stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"If the defendant perceives the connection between his crime      and his punishment, the retributive goal of the criminal law      is satisfied.  And only if the defendant is aware that his      death is approaching can he prepare himself for his passing.      Accordingly, I would hold that the Eighth Amendment forbids      the execution only of those who are unaware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why they are to suffer it.\" <i>Id.,</i> 106 S.Ct. at 2608-09.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's claim is founded on an affidavit by a licensed clinical psychologist stating his findings as to petitioner's sanity.

In response, the State submitted affidavits that disputed petitioner's claims.  The Mississippi Supreme Court did not hold a hearing in this matter, nor did it even consider the affidavits presented by the State. Instead, the court simply concluded, without explanation, that it did \"not find it necessary to consider [the State's affidavits] because Petitioner fails to make out a prima facie case of present insanity by his affidavits.\"  <i>Johnson v. State,</i> --- So.2d ----, ---- n. 1 (No. DP-16, May 18, 1987) (slip op. 1, n. 1).

Yet this individual, according to the Mississippi Supreme Court, has not raised even a prima facie <i>Ford</i> claim sufficient to warrant <i>consideration</i> of the State's response.
