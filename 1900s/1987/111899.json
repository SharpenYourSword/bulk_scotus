The Court of Appeals agreed.  It concluded that since, in its view, \"<i>Franklin</i> did not constitute 'new law[,'] petitioner's <i>Franklin</i> claim should have been raised in his first petition,\" and that therefore it was an abuse of the writ under Habeas Corpus Rule 9(b), 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254. --- F.2d ---- Crim. Action No. 87-8357 (CA11, May 27, 1987).

Both the prosecutor and the defense attorney focused their closing remarks on Tucker's state of mind and his ability <i>vel non</i> to form the requisite criminal intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court's instruction to the jury included the following charge on the burden of proof with respect to the defendant's criminal intent:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ladies and Gentlemen, a crime is the violation of the Statute      of this State in which there shall be a union or joint      operation of act and intention, or criminal negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Now, I'm going to give you certain presumptions.

The      person will not be presumed to act with criminal intention,      but the trier of facts, and that's you the jury, may find      such intention upon consideration of the words, conduct,      demeanor and other circumstances connected with the act for      which the accused is prosecuted.</i>  Tr.

The District Court denied an evidentiary hearing on this claim solely on its conclusion that the petition constituted an abuse of the writ, because Tucker had filed a previous petition for federal habeas corpus in District Court on January 28, 1982 that did not raise the <i>Franklin</i> claim.  The Court of Appeals agreed.  It concluded that since, in its view, \"<i>Franklin</i> did not constitute 'new law[,'] petitioner's <i>Franklin</i> claim should have been raised in his first petition,\" and that therefore it was an abuse of the writ under Habeas Corpus Rule 9(b), 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254. --- F.2d ---- Crim. Action No. 87-8357 (CA11, May 27, 1987).  Rule 9(b) allows a federal court to dismiss a second federal petition when \"new and different grounds are alleged,\" if \"the judge finds that the failure of the petitioner to assert those grounds in a prior petition constituted an abuse of the writ.\"  <i>Ibid.</i> 1076</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, Tucker's failure to raise the <i>Franklin</i> claim in his first petition for federal habeas relief does not constitute abuse of the writ under Rule 9(b).  In <i>Sanders v. United States,</i> 373 U.S. 1, 18, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 1078, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963), the Court established guidelines for cases involving potential abuse of the writ:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Thus, for example, if a prisoner <i>deliberately</i> withholds one      of two grounds for federal collateral relief at the time of      filing his first application, in the hope of being granted      two hearings rather than one or for some other such reason,      he may be deemed to have waived his right to a hearing on a      second application presenting the withheld ground.  The same      may be true if, as in <i>Wong Doo</i> [<i>v. United States,</i> 265 U.S.      239, 44 S.Ct. 524, 68 L.Ed. 999 (1924) ], the prisoner      <i>deliberately abandons</i> one of his grounds at the first      hearing.  Nothing in the traditions of habeas corpus requires      the federal courts to tolerate needless piecemeal litigation,      or to entertain collateral proceedings whose <i>only purpose</i> is      to vex, harass, or delay.\"  373 U.S., at 18, 83 S.Ct., at      1068 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit requires a habeas petitioner to demonstrate that \"the failure to present the ground in the prior proceeding was neither the result of an intentional abandonment or withholding nor the product of inexcusable neglect\" to avoid dismissal of a subsequent petition. <i>Witt v. Wainwright,</i> 755 F.2d 1396, 1397 (CA11 1985), <i>rev'd on other grounds,</i> 469 U.S. 412, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985), quoted in <i>Fleming v.

The Georgia Supreme Court had earlier dismissed Franklin's appeal raising the burden of proof issue in 1980, eight months before Tucker's appeal to that same court.   <i>Franklin v. State,</i> 245 Ga. 141, 153-154, 263 S.E.2d 666 (1980).  Tucker did not raise the <i>Franklin</i> claim at that time.  Thus, Tucker had a perfectly valid reason for his failure to raise the <i>Franklin</i> claim in his first federal habeas petition&#8212;it would obviously have been frivolous to do so.  The Georgia Supreme Court repeatedly rejected <i>Franklin</i> claims during the two years in which Tucker had the opportunity to present the claim in state courts, prior to filing his first federal habeas in January 1982.  See, <i>e.g., Rose v. State,</i> 249 Ga. 628, 631, 292 S.E.2d 678, 681 (1982);  <i>Zant v. Gaddis,</i> 247 Ga. 717, 718, 279 S.E.2d 219, 220 (1981), <i>cert. denied,</i> 454 U.S. 1037, 102 S.Ct. 579, 70 L.Ed.2d 483 (1981);  <i>Lackey v. State,</i> 246 Ga. 331, 338, 271 S.E.2d 478, 484 (1980);  <i>Robinson v. State,</i> 246 Ga. 469, 470-471, 271 S.E.2d 786, 788 (1980);  <i>Adams v. State,</i> 246 Ga. 119, 122, 269 S.E.2d 11, 13 (1980);  <i>Bridges v. State,</i> 246 Ga. 323, 324, 271 S.E.2d 471, 472 (1980).  It is unreasonable, therefore, to dismiss this second federal habeas petition on the ground that petitioner's failure to raise in his first petition what was a frivolous claim barred him forever from asserting that claim once <i>Francis</i> made clear that it was viable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record in this case contains no evidence that the <i>Franklin</i> claim was intentionally abandoned or deliberately withheld.

The language of the charge was      taken nearly verbatim from Georgia statutes which had      repeatedly been upheld by the Georgia Supreme Court.  I was      aware of no case that would indicate that this portion of the      jury charge was unconstitutional and I had no reason to      believe that that charge was improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We included in the petition for writ of habeas corpus      all claims which appeared to be viable based on our reasoned      and professional judgment of the facts and law.  It was our      intent to include all nonfrivolous claims.  We did not      deliberately withhold this claim or intentionmally abandon      it.  This claim was not included in the petition because in      the exercise of our reasoned professional judgment we were      not aware that it existed.\"  Affidavits of Robert B. Remar and Eric G.

Here, the Court permits a man to be executed despite the likelihood that his conviction was obtained in violation of this fundamental tenet of our criminal law.  It does so on the untenable ground that petitioner has abused the writ by failing to anticipate that a claim repeatedly held without merit by the State Supreme Court would ultimately be vindicated here.
