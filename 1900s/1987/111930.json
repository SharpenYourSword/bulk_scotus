The respondents in this case brought a negligence action against the petitioner and an individual defendant in state court.  After seven days of trial, the trial court dismissed the individual defendant.  Petitioner then filed a removal petition in federal court, alleging diversity of citizenship.  The state trial court proceeded despite the removal petition and the jury rendered a verdict against petitioner. Subsequently, the District Court held that the case was not properly removed because the individual defendant was dismissed on the merits and not, as petitioner contended, with the consent of the plaintiffs.
