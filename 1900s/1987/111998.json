In the years that have followed, we have not determined if <i>White'</i>s holding applies only to fee requests under a separate statutory provision like &#167; 1988, or if it also renders \"collateral\" those fee requests made in cases where the fee award arises as an integral part of the underlying dispute between the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently, several questions concerning the finality (and, as a result, the appealability) of judgments encompassing fee awards in cases of the latter type have been the subject of confusion in the Courts of Appeals.

The District Court awarded respondent principal and interest \"plus reasonable attorney's fees incurred\" by respondent.  App. to Pet. for Cert. D-7.  The District Court did not fix an amount for the attorney's fees at that time.

On respondent's subsequent petition for fees, however, the District Court entertained petitioners' Illinois law challenge to the fee award, and determined that Illinois law prohibited a fee award in this case.  635 F.Supp. 1257 (ND Ill.1986).  The Court of Appeals reversed this decision, finding that \"reservation of the determination of the amount of attorney's fees does not deprive the initial [district court] judgment of finality,\" and therefore the District Court could not reconsider respondent's entitlement to fees in its second decision.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"486591\"><a href=\"/opinion/486591/barrington-press-inc-an-illinois-corporation-count/\"><span class=\"volume\">816</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span>, 342 (CA7 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Courts of Appeals are sharply divided over the question presented here:  whether an award of attorney's fees, when it arises out of a claimant's underlying cause of action, is final before that award is quantified.
