In this case, petitioner was convicted of mail fraud.  At the trial, the Government called as a witness an unindicted co-conspirator who was alleged to have engaged in the same kind of conduct for which petitioner was indicted.  The witness' attorney informed the prosecutor and the court that his client would invoke the privilege if he were called to testify, and the witness did invoke the privilege when he was called outside the presence of the jury.  When the jury returned, the prosecution called the witness and he was permitted to testify after the trial court overruled petitioner's objection.  Once again, after stating his name and place of residence, the witness invoked the Fifth Amendment privilege and refused to testify in response to five different questions.
