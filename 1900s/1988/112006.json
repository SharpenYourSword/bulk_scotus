In this case, petitioner was convicted by a federal jury on the felony charge of stealing Government property.  A United States Magistrate presided over the selection of the jury which, despite the relatively routine nature of the charges, took about four hours and was not free of difficulty.  Neither the Government nor defense counsel expressly consented or objected to the Magistrate's presiding over the <i>voir dire</i> proceedings.  On appeal, petitioner argued that the District Court violated the Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 631-639 (1982 ed. and Supp. III), by allowing the Magistrate to preside over jury selection. A panel of the Fifth Circuit rejected this argument.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474517\"><a href=\"/opinion/474517/united-states-v-lois-e-hilton-ford/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1329</span></a></span> (1986), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1070</span></span>, 107 S.Ct. 964, 93 L.Ed.2d 1011 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was accepted for rehearing en banc, and in a split decision the full court affirmed, though on other grounds.
