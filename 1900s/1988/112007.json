In this case, the petitioner argued that he was prejudiced by the prosecutorial delay in filing the indictment against him, for it was filed 13 days after he turned 21 years of age, and consequently he was ineligible for the protections of the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 5031 <i>et seq.</i>  The Second Circuit held that there was no due process violation because petitioner \"made no showing of an improper prosecutorial motive.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492366\"><a href=\"/opinion/492366/united-states-v-perry-hoo/\"><span class=\"volume\">825</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span>, 671 (1987).

Two Circuits, however, have concluded that intentional misconduct is not the <i>sine qua non</i> for a due process violation from prosecutorial preindictment delay, and instead they hold that the proper inquiry is to balance the prejudice to the defendant against the Government's justification for delay.  <i>United States v.
