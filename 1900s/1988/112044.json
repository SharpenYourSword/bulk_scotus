We do not believe that the Court may recognize any such exception to the abiding rule that it treat all litigants equally: that is, that the claim of any litigant for the application of a rule to its case should not be influenced by the Court's view of the worthiness of the litigant in terms of extralegal criteria. We think this is what Congress meant when it required each Justice or judge of the United States to swear to \"administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich. . . .\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 453.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Justice BRENNAN, Justice MARSHALL, and Justice STEVENS join, dissenting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court today asks the parties to rebrief and reargue this case, focusing not on some neglected subtlety of the issues presented for review or on any overlooked jurisdictional detail, but on a question not presented:  Whether the Court should reconsider its 7-2 opinion (WHITE and REHNQUIST, JJ., dissenting) in <i>Runyon v. McCrary,</i> 427 U.S. 160, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976).  The Court's determination now to reach out to reconsider that prior decision and everything that has been built upon it, is neither restrained, nor judicious, nor consistent with the accepted doctrine of <i>stare decisis.</i>  See, <i>e.g., Vasquez v.

Railway Express Agency, Inc.,</i> 421 U.S. 454, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975), we observed that it is \"well established\" that 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981 \"prohibits racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of private contracts.\"  <i>Runyon v. McCrary,</i> 427 U.S., at 168, 96 S.Ct., at 2593.  We reaffirmed our reading of the legislative history and language of the statute as reaching private acts of racial discrimination, and emphasized that in the years since <i>Jones,</i> Congress specifically had considered and rejected legislation to override our interpretation of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, on which &#167; 1981 is based.  427 U.S., at 174, and n. 11, 96 S.Ct., at 2596, and n. 11.

See, <i>e.g., Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co.,</i> 482 U.S. 656, 107 S.Ct. 2617, 96 L.Ed.2d 572 (1987);  <i>Saint Francis College v.

See also <i>Mem-</i> phis <i>v. Greene,</i> 451 U.S. 100, 101 S.Ct. 1584, 67 L.Ed.2d 769 (1981).  Over 100 lower court opinions cite the relevant portions of <i>Runyon</i> and its progeny.  The parties in this case have not informed us of anything that suggests Congress has reconsidered its position on this statutory matter in light of <i>Runyon</i> and subsequent cases.

I am at a loss to understand the motivation of five Members of this Court to reconsider an interpretation of a civil rights statute that so clearly reflects our society's earnest commitment to ending racial discrimination, and in which Congress so evidently has acquiesced.

McCrary,</i> 427 U.S. 160, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976), is certain to engender widespread concern in those segments of our population that must rely on a federal rule of law as a protection against invidious private discrimination. Although the present case involves a claim of discrimination in the workplace, an area of the law where there is substantial overlap between 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e <i>et seq.,</i> a reexamination of the issue of statutory construction decided in <i>Runyon</i> implicates a much broader sphere of conduct.  <i>Run-</i> yon itself did not involve a claim of employment discrimination, but the question \"whether . . . 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981, prohibits private schools from excluding qualified children solely because they are Negroes.\"  427 U.S., at 163, 96 S.Ct., at 2591.  The Court's order today will, by itself, have a deleterious effect on the faith reposed by racial minorities in the continuing stability of a rule of law that guarantees them the \"same right\" as \"white citizens.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a>  To recognize an equality right&#8212;a right that 12 years ago we thought \"well established\"&#8212;and then to declare unceremoniously that perhaps we were wrong and had better reconsider our prior judgment, is to replace what is ideally a sense of guaranteed right with the uneasiness of unsecured privilege.  Time alone will tell whether the erosion in faith is unnecessarily precipitous, but in the meantime, some of the harm that will flow from today's order may never be completely undone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the impact of today's decision on the faith of victims of racial discrimination in a stable construction of the civil rights laws, the order must also have a detrimental and enduring impact on the public's perception of the Court as an impartial adjudicator of cases and controversies brought to us for decision by lawyers representing adverse interests in contested litigation.  The parties have asked us to decide whether &#167; 1981 encompasses \"a claim for racial discrimination in the terms and conditions of employment, including a claim that petitioner was harassed because of her race.\"  Pet. for Cert. i.  Neither the parties nor the Solicitor General have argued that <i>Runyon</i> should be reconsidered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As I have said before, \"the adversary process functions most effectively when we rely on the initiative of lawyers, rather than the activism of judges, to fashion the questions for review.\"  <i>New Jersey v.

If the Court decides to cast itself adrift from the constraints imposed by the adversary process and to fashion its own agenda, the consequences for the Nation&#8212;and for the future of this Court as an institution&#8212;will be even more serious than any temporary encouragement of previously rejected forms of racial discrimination.

We reaffirmed our reading of the legislative history and language of the statute as reaching private acts of racial discrimination, and emphasized that in the years since <i>Jones,</i> Congress specifically had considered and rejected legislation to override our interpretation of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, on which § 1981 is based. 427 U.

Although the present case involves a claim of discrimination in the workplace, an area of the law where there is substantial overlap between 42 U. S. C. § 1981 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, 42 U. S.

The Court's order today will, by itself, have a deleterious effect on the faith reposed by racial minorities in the continuing stability of a rule of law that guarantees them the \"same right\" as \"white citizens.\"<sup>[*]</sup> To recognize an equality right  a right that 12 years ago we thought \"well established\"  and then to declare unceremoniously that perhaps we were wrong and had better reconsider our prior judgment, is to replace what is ideally a sense of guaranteed right with the uneasiness of unsecured privilege.

The parties are requested to brief and argue the following question:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Whether or not the interpretation of 42 U. S.

One would also think from the language of the dissents that we have decided today to overrule <i>Runyon</i> v. <i>McCrary</i><i>.</i> We have of course done no such thing, but have decided, in light of the difficulties posed by petitioner's argument for a fundamental extension of liability under 42 U. S. C. § 1981, to consider <i>whether Runyon</i> should be overruled. It is surely no affront to settled jurisprudence to request argument on whether a particular precedent should be modified or overruled.</p>\n<p>Three Terms ago, for example, we requested the parties to reargue the validity of our decision in <i>National League of Cities</i> v. <i>Usery,</i> 426 U. S. 833 (1976). <i>Garcia</i> v. <i>San Antonio</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*618</span> <i>Metropolitan Transit Authority,</i> 468 U. S. 1213 (1984) (ordering reargument), 469 U.

Two Terms before that we requested the parties to reargue and brief the question whether the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule should apply where the evidence was obtained reasonably and in good faith. <i>Illinois</i> v. <i>Gates,</i> 459 U. S. 1028 (1982) (ordering reargument), 462 U. S. 213 (1983) (decision). In 1975, we ordered the parties in <i>Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc.</i> v. <i>Republic of Cuba,</i> 422 U. S. 1005 (1975) (ordering reargument), 425 U. S. 682 (1976) (decision), to address whether we should reconsider our holding in <i>Banco Nacional de Cuba</i> v. <i>Sabbatino,</i> 376 U. S. 398, 439 (1964), which had reaffirmed the Court's adherence to the \"act of state\" doctrine. And in <i>Benton</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> 393 U. S. 994 (1968) (ordering reargument), 395 U. S. 784 (1969) (decision), the Court requested reargument on the question whether the \"concurrent sentence doctrine\" had continuing validity.</p>\n<p>In addition, we have explicitly overruled statutory precedents in a host of cases.
