In <i>Ford v.

A majority did, however, hold that due process demands a hearing at least once the prisoner has made some \"threshold showing\" that he has become insane since his trial.  <i>Id.,</i> at 417, 106 S.Ct., at 2605 (opinion of MARSHALL, J., joined by BRENNAN, BLACKMUN, and STEVENS, JJ.); <i>id.,</i> at 426, 106 S.Ct., at 2610 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Justice Powell, providing a fifth vote for that proposition, stated that \"[t]he State . . . may properly presume that petitioner remains sane at the time sentence is to be carried out, and may require a substantial threshold showing of insanity merely to trigger the hearing process.\"  <i>Ibid.</i> (footnote omitted).  See also <i>id.,</i> at 429-430, 106 S.Ct., at 2611-2612 (O'CONNOR, J., joined by WHITE, J., concurring in result in part and dissenting in part) (where state law prohibits execution of the insane, the State must provide a hearing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Louisiana Legislature has set the requisite \"threshold showing\" at that level of evidence that would constitute a \"reasonable ground to doubt\" the prisoner's sanity.  La.Code Crim.Proc.Ann., Art. 643 (West 1981).  It is beyond me why Dr. Zimmerman's unrefuted affidavit did not meet that threshold.  For that matter, I am at a loss to explain why the affidavit, which was the sole evidence before the courts, did not establish petitioner's insanity by a preponderance of the evidence, entitling petitioner not merely to a hearing but to the relief he seeks.  Neither state court furnished any explanation.  In fact, neither court so much as articulated the standard it was applying. For all we know, the state courts defaulted entirely on their obligation to consider petitioner's claim.  The Louisiana courts, by declining to provide any explanation for their denial of relief, as a practical matter have required petitioner to meet not \"a substantial threshold showing of insanity\" but an insurmountable one.  The effect extends far beyond this case, for the state courts have challenged all death-row inmates to a harrowing game of Russian roulette, in which each must take a wild guess at the \"threshold\" or suffer the consequences.  Where, as here, there is no way to discern whether the state courts' \"fact-finding procedure . . . was not adequate for reaching reasonably correct results,\" <i>Townsend v. Sain,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106544\"><a href=\"/opinion/106544/townsend-v-sain/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></a></span>, 316, 83 S.Ct. 745, 757, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), their bare denial of relief is entitled to no presumption of correctness.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even more outrageous was the injustice perpetrated by the federal courts to which petitioner resorted upon the state courts' default of their constitutional responsibilities.  The District Court expressly adopted Dr. Zimmerman's conclusion that petitioner was a \"paranoid schizophrenic.\"  Civ. Action No. 88-1549, <i>supra,</i> at 3.  That conclusion should have compelled the District Court, at the very least, to \"receive evidence and argument from [petitioner's] counsel\" on whether petitioner is \"aware that his death is approaching\" and \"perceives the connection between his crime and his punishment.\"  <i>Ford, supra,</i> 477 U.S., at 427, 422, 106 S.Ct., at 2610, 2608 (opinion of POWELL, J.).  Instead, the District Court excluded counsel entirely and conducted its own <i>ex parte</i> investigation in which it managed to extract from Dr. Zimmerman a concession (\"Petitioner . . . is apparently able to understand that the execution is going forward in accordance with law,\" Civ. Action No. 88-1547, <i>supra,</i> at 3) that contradicted his sworn affidavit dated three days earlier (\"[H]e is currently unable to understand the death penalty,\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 3).  The District Court's consideration of petitioner's insanity claim fell far short of the <i>de novo</i> review that it was obliged to provide upon the state courts' default.  See <i>Ford,</i> 477 U.S., at 418, 106 S.Ct., at 2606.  Instead, its review was functionally equivalent to the \" 'policy of excluding all advocacy on the part of the condemned,' \" which we have held unconstitutional.  <i>Id.,</i> at 412-413, 106 S.Ct., at 2603 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Worse yet, petitioner alleges&#8212;and the State does not deny that the District Court conducted its <i>ex parte</i> investigation before it even had jurisdiction over the case;  as Judge Johnson, dissenting from the Court of Appeals' judgment, observed, \"the district court failed to make any finding <i>on</i> the record.\"  843 F.2d, at 188.  \"Procedural shortcuts are always dangerous. Greater&#8212;surely not lesser&#8212;care should be taken to avoid the risk of error when its consequences are irreversible.\"  <i>Autry v.

Even that determination hopelessly conflated the principles articulated in <i>Ford.</i>  From Justice Powell's observation that the \"State . . . <i>may</i> require a substantial threshold showing of insanity merely to trigger the hearing process,\" <i>Ford, supra,</i> 477 U.S., at 426, 106 S.Ct., at 2610 (emphasis added), the Court of Appeals supposed that the State <i>must</i> do so, see 843 F.2d, at 187 (\"[P]etitioner has not made a substantial threshold showing\"), and overlooked the State's decision to require merely a showing of a \"reasonable ground to doubt\" in order to trigger further examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The abuses and mistakes in every court that has considered this case are no doubt attributable, at least in part, to the haste with which they proceeded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>1.

If the federal courts are intent on accelerating the pace at any cost, as they were in this case, their only choice is to take procedural shortcuts and give short shrift to substance.

A majority did, however, hold that due process demands a hearing at least once the prisoner has made some \"threshold showing\" that he has become insane since his trial.  <i>Id.,</i> at 417, 106 S.Ct., at 2605 (opinion of MARSHALL, J., joined by BRENNAN, BLACKMUN, and STEVENS, JJ.); <i>id.,</i> at 426, 106 S.Ct., at 2610 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Justice Powell, providing a fifth vote for that proposition, stated that \"[t]he State . . . may properly presume that petitioner remains sane at the time sentence is to be carried out, and may require a substantial threshold showing of insanity merely to trigger the hearing process.\"  <i>Ibid.</i> (footnote omitted).  See also <i>id.,</i> at 429-430, 106 S.Ct., at 2611-2612 (O'CONNOR, J., joined by WHITE, J., concurring in result in part and dissenting in part) (where state law prohibits execution of the insane, the State must provide a hearing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Louisiana Legislature has set the requisite \"threshold showing\" at that level of evidence that would constitute a \"reasonable ground to doubt\" the prisoner's sanity.  La.Code Crim.Proc.Ann., Art. 643 (West 1981).  It is beyond me why Dr. Zimmerman's unrefuted affidavit did not meet that threshold.  For that matter, I am at a loss to explain why the affidavit, which was the sole evidence before the courts, did not establish petitioner's insanity by a preponderance of the evidence, entitling petitioner not merely to a hearing but to the relief he seeks.  Neither state court furnished any explanation.  In fact, neither court so much as articulated the standard it was applying. For all we know, the state courts defaulted entirely on their obligation to consider petitioner's claim.  The Louisiana courts, by declining to provide any explanation for their denial of relief, as a practical matter have required petitioner to meet not \"a substantial threshold showing of insanity\" but an insurmountable one.  The effect extends far beyond this case, for the state courts have challenged all death-row inmates to a harrowing game of Russian roulette, in which each must take a wild guess at the \"threshold\" or suffer the consequences.  Where, as here, there is no way to discern whether the state courts' \"fact-finding procedure . . . was not adequate for reaching reasonably correct results,\" <i>Townsend v. Sain,</i> 372 U.S. 293, 316, 83 S.Ct. 745, 757, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), their bare denial of relief is entitled to no presumption of correctness.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even more outrageous was the injustice perpetrated by the federal courts to which petitioner resorted upon the state courts' default of their constitutional responsibilities.  The District Court expressly adopted Dr. Zimmerman's conclusion that petitioner was a \"paranoid schizophrenic.\"  Civ. Action No. 88-1549, <i>supra,</i> at 3.  That conclusion should have compelled the District Court, at the very least, to \"receive evidence and argument from [petitioner's] counsel\" on whether petitioner is \"aware that his death is approaching\" and \"perceives the connection between his crime and his punishment.\"  <i>Ford, supra,</i> 477 U.S., at 427, 422, 106 S.Ct., at 2610, 2608 (opinion of POWELL, J.).  Instead, the District Court excluded counsel entirely and conducted its own <i>ex parte</i> investigation in which it managed to extract from Dr. Zimmerman a concession (\"Petitioner . . . is apparently able to understand that the execution is going forward in accordance with law,\" Civ. Action No. 88-1547, <i>supra,</i> at 3) that contradicted his sworn affidavit dated three days earlier (\"[H]e is currently unable to understand the death penalty,\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 3).  The District Court's consideration of petitioner's insanity claim fell far short of the <i>de novo</i> review that it was obliged to provide upon the state courts' default.  See <i>Ford,</i> 477 U.S., at 418, 106 S.Ct., at 2606.  Instead, its review was functionally equivalent to the \" 'policy of excluding all advocacy on the part of the condemned,' \" which we have held unconstitutional.  <i>Id.,</i> at 412-413, 106 S.Ct., at 2603 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Worse yet, petitioner alleges&#8212;and the State does not deny that the District Court conducted its <i>ex parte</i> investigation before it even had jurisdiction over the case;  as Judge Johnson, dissenting from the Court of Appeals' judgment, observed, \"the district court failed to make any finding <i>on</i> the record.\"  843 F.2d, at 188.  \"Procedural shortcuts are always dangerous. Greater&#8212;surely not lesser&#8212;care should be taken to avoid the risk of error when its consequences are irreversible.\"  <i>Autry v. Estelle,</i> 464 U.S. 1, 6, 104 S.Ct. 20, 23, 78 L.Ed.2d 1 (1983) (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court of Appeals, for its part, compounded the District Court's abuse by ignoring it entirely and proceeding to address the sufficiency of Dr. Zimmerman's affidavit as an original matter, without a proper District Court predicate.  Even that determination hopelessly conflated the principles articulated in <i>Ford.</i>  From Justice Powell's observation that the \"State . . . <i>may</i> require a substantial threshold showing of insanity merely to trigger the hearing process,\" <i>Ford, supra,</i> 477 U.S., at 426, 106 S.Ct., at 2610 (emphasis added), the Court of Appeals supposed that the State <i>must</i> do so, see 843 F.2d, at 187 (\"[P]etitioner has not made a substantial threshold showing\"), and overlooked the State's decision to require merely a showing of a \"reasonable ground to doubt\" in order to trigger further examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The abuses and mistakes in every court that has considered this case are no doubt attributable, at least in part, to the haste with which they proceeded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>1.

At 8:30 p.m. the District Court denied petitioner's      application.  <i>Id.,</i> at 185.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5.

At 12:45 a.m. (15 minutes before the scheduled      execution) the Court of Appeals' opinions were circulated to      this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7.

At 1:25 a.m. petitioner was pronounced dead.  N.Y.      Times, Apr. 14, 1988, p. A28, col. 1.

It is hardly surprising that a case scudding through the state courts in 24 hours should yield orders devoid of law or logic&#8212;the ones in this case simply read, \"DENIED\"&#8212;for which the description \"terse\" would be charitable.  If the federal courts are intent on accelerating the pace at any cost, as they were in this case, their only choice is to take procedural shortcuts and give short shrift to substance.  And simple arithmetic suggests grave injustice when the Court of last resort takes 15 minutes to read and analyze 17 pages of opinions from the court below and cast a vote on life or death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Due process means little if it requires the courts to provide an \"opportunity to be heard,\" <i>Grannis v. Ordean,</i> 234 U.S. 385, 394, 34 S.Ct. 779, 783, 58 L.Ed. 1363 (1914), without imposing on them a concomitant duty to listen&#8212;and, at least when a life is at stake, to listen very carefully.  Presumably, it was in recognition of the injustice that four of us (one less than the requisite five) voted to stay petitioner's execution, so as to consider his insanity claim in an atmosphere that was not itself lunatic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regrettably, this case is not atypical.  It is the natural product of a penal system conducive to inaccurate factfinding and shoddy analysis.  And I doubt that any system could be devised to cure the evil, so long as States continue to impose punishments so severe as to be irrevocable.  Even were I not convinced that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment, see <i>Gregg v. Georgia,</i> 428 U.S. 153, 227, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2950, 2973, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976) (dissenting opinion), I would have no part of a penal system that permits a State's interest in meting out death on schedule to convert our constitutional duty to dispense justice into a license to dispense with it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice BLACKMUN and Justice STEVENS would grant the application for stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
