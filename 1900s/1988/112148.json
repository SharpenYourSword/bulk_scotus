The District Court, in an unpublished opinion, dismissed the suit on the ground that the General Counsel's decision to dismiss was not subject to judicial review.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, also in an unpublished opinion, affirmed.

The statute that <i>Webster</i> found insufficiently clear for that purpose pertained to the Central Intelligence Agency, and provided that \"[n]otwithstanding . . . the provisions of any other law, the Director of Central Intelligence may, in his discretion, terminate the employment of any officer or employee of the Agency whenever he shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States.\"  50 U.S.C. &#167; 403(c).  The statute at issue in the present case pertains to the NLRB, and provides that the General Counsel \"shall have final authority, on behalf of the Board, in respect of the investigation of charges and issuance of complaints under section 160 of this title, and in respect of the prosecution of such complaints before the Board. . . .\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 153(d).  The present case, involving constitutional claims, is unquestionably a prime candidate for application of the new principle we adopted in <i>Webster.</i>  While the area of administrative activity to which the suit pertains (enforcement discretion) is one in which agencies have traditionally been accorded broad insulation from judicial review, see <i>Heckler v.

See R. Stern, E. Gressman, &amp; S. Shapiro, Supreme Court Practice &#167; 5.12, p. 279 (6th ed. 1986).  If we adhere to the rationale of <i>Webster,</i> we should certainly grant this petition for certiorari, vacate the judgment of the Sixth Circuit, and remand this case for reconsideration in light of <i>Webster.</i>  It was my view that the rationale of <i>Webster</i> was wrong, because it did not square with the outcome of perfectly commonplace and perfectly correct decisions such as that of the Sixth Circuit here.  See 486 U.S., at 606, 108 S.Ct., at ---- (SCALIA, J., dissenting).
