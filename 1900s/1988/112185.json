It is not immediately apparent to me&#8212;as it must not be to litigants in the cases in which certiorari was denied, or to judges in the federal and state court systems&#8212;why the Court granted certiorari in these 12 cases, but not in the previously listed 16 in which I have dissented or am dissenting from the denial of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to say that review should not have been granted in the 12 cases that will be reviewed.  To the contrary:  where cases present issues over which the federal and state courts have divided, this Court has a special obligation to intercede and provide some definitive resolution of the issues.  Cf. this Court's Rule 17.  Rather, my point is that this Court is only fulfilling this role with respect to some of the cases brought here on review, and not others&#8212;and the method by which it distinguishes between the two is elusive, to say the least.  This is the principal reason why I have dissented from so many of the Court's decisions to deny certiorari in the past:  almost 200 times in the past three Terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As I see it, the reason the Court grants review in some of these cases, but does not do so in many others, is the limitation placed on the Court's docket by its resources:  its finite ability to hear arguments and issue decisions in only a given number of cases in each Term.  The Court would rather give prompt attention to all cases in which it grants review than grant review in a larger number of cases in any Term than it can hear in a single Term, for to do the latter would necessarily afford only delayed review in every case in which plenary consideration is granted. That may well be a justifiable course of action, but it does tend to conceal the fact that many cases that deserve review are being denied review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also clear that, so far this Term, the Court has limited its argument intake to a modest number.  In our first two conferences this Term, we denied review in 1,074 cases, and granted review in 32.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  We thus granted review in 2.8% of the petitions acted upon.  Should we continue to grant review at this rate for the rest of the Term, and if the applications for review acted upon this Term total 4,650 (3% more than last Term), we will have granted review in only 130 cases&#8212;considerably less than the 170 cases we have been deciding each Term (which would likely be disposed of in approximately 150 hours of argument time and 150 opinions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The majority rule, holding that IAD violations, without more, do not state a claim for habeas relief, has been adopted by the Fourth and Sixth Circuits (as illustrated by these two cases) as well as the First Circuit, <i>Fasano v.

McLaughlin,</i> 488 U.S. 898, 109 S.Ct. 243, 102 L.Ed.2d 232;  <i>Cleveland Newspaper Guild v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co.,</i> 488 U.S. 899, 109 S.Ct. 245, 102 L.Ed.2d 234;  <i>Hartenstine v. Superior Court,</i> 488 U.S. 899, 109 S.Ct. 245, 102 L.Ed.2d 234;  <i>Young v. Langley,</i> 488 U.S. 898, 109 S.Ct. 243, 102 L.Ed.2d 232;  <i>Kahn v. Avnet, Inc.,</i> 488 U.S. 898, 109 S.Ct. 243, 102 L.Ed.2d 232;  <i>Feaster v. United States,</i> 488 U.S. 898, 109 S.Ct. 244, 102 L.Ed.2d 232;  <i>Gruenholz v. United States,</i> 488 U.S. 898, 109 S.Ct. 244, 102 L.Ed.2d 232;  <i>Union Pacific R. Co. v. Moritz,</i> 488 U.S. 899, 109 S.Ct. 244, 102 L.Ed.2d 233;  <i>Kreisher v. Mobile Oil Corp.,</i> 488 U.S. 899, 109 S.Ct. 244, 102 L.Ed.2d 233;  <i>Robinson v. Connecticut,</i> 488 U.S. 899, 109 S.Ct. 244, 102 L.Ed.2d 233;  <i>Stamler v. Zamboni,</i> 488 U.S. 899, 109 S.Ct. 245, 102 L.Ed.2d 233;  and <i>Torres-Arboledo v. Florida,</i> 488 U.S. 901, 109 S.Ct. 250, 102 L.Ed.2d 239.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I noted my dissent from the denial of review in all of these cases.  Most of them present questions of the proper interpretation of federal statutes, and a few involve questions of constitutional interpretation.  These questions concern issues that have divided the Courts of Appeals (or, in some instances, the state courts), and require our attention when it is so apparent that some persons are being protected or being sanctioned by the federal law and others are not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I also note that the Court granted certiorari (or noted probable jurisdiction) so far this Term in at least 12 cases which, like these, raise questions of federal statutory interpretation that had divided the lower courts.  See, <i>e.g., Lorance v. AT &amp; T Technologies, Inc.,</i> 488 U.S. 887, 109 S.Ct. 217, 102 L.Ed.2d 208;  <i>Texas State Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist.,</i> 488 U.S. 815, 109 S.Ct. 51, 102 L.Ed.2d 30;  <i>California v. ARC America Corp.,</i> 488 U.S. 814, 109 S.Ct. 51, 102 L.Ed.2d 29;  <i>Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ins. Corp. v. Ticktin,</i> 488 U.S. 815, 109 S.Ct. 52, 102 L.Ed.2d 30;  <i>Mead Corp. v. Tilley,</i> 488 U.S. 815, 109 S.Ct. 52, 102 L.Ed.2d 31;  <i>Neitzke v. Williams,</i> 488 U.S. 816, 109 S.Ct. 53, 102 L.Ed.2d 32;  <i>Finley v. United States,</i> 488 U.S. 815, 109 S.Ct. 52, 102 L.Ed.2d 31;  <i>Hardin v. Straub,</i> 488 U.S. 887, 109 S.Ct. 217, 102 L.Ed.2d 209;  <i>Lauro Lines s.r.l. v.</i> Chasser, 488 U.S. 887, 109 S.Ct. 217, 102 L.Ed.2d 208; <i>Massachusetts v. Morash,</i> 488 U.S. 815, 109 S.Ct. 53, 102 L.Ed.2d 31;  <i>Missouri v. Jenkins,</i> 488 U.S. 888, 109 S.Ct. 218, 102 L.Ed.2d 209;  <i>Duckworth v. Eagan,</i> 488 U.S. 888, 109 S.Ct. 218, 102 L.Ed.2d 209.  It is not immediately apparent to me&#8212;as it must not be to litigants in the cases in which certiorari was denied, or to judges in the federal and state court systems&#8212;why the Court granted certiorari in these 12 cases, but not in the previously listed 16 in which I have dissented or am dissenting from the denial of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to say that review should not have been granted in the 12 cases that will be reviewed.  To the contrary:  where cases present issues over which the federal and state courts have divided, this Court has a special obligation to intercede and provide some definitive resolution of the issues.  Cf. this Court's Rule 17.  Rather, my point is that this Court is only fulfilling this role with respect to some of the cases brought here on review, and not others&#8212;and the method by which it distinguishes between the two is elusive, to say the least.  This is the principal reason why I have dissented from so many of the Court's decisions to deny certiorari in the past:  almost 200 times in the past three Terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As I see it, the reason the Court grants review in some of these cases, but does not do so in many others, is the limitation placed on the Court's docket by its resources:  its finite ability to hear arguments and issue decisions in only a given number of cases in each Term.  The Court would rather give prompt attention to all cases in which it grants review than grant review in a larger number of cases in any Term than it can hear in a single Term, for to do the latter would necessarily afford only delayed review in every case in which plenary consideration is granted. That may well be a justifiable course of action, but it does tend to conceal the fact that many cases that deserve review are being denied review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also clear that, so far this Term, the Court has limited its argument intake to a modest number.  In our first two conferences this Term, we denied review in 1,074 cases, and granted review in 32.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  We thus granted review in 2.8% of the petitions acted upon.  Should we continue to grant review at this rate for the rest of the Term, and if the applications for review acted upon this Term total 4,650 (3% more than last Term), we will have granted review in only 130 cases&#8212;considerably less than the 170 cases we have been deciding each Term (which would likely be disposed of in approximately 150 hours of argument time and 150 opinions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The majority rule, holding that IAD violations, without more, do not state a claim for habeas relief, has been adopted by the Fourth and Sixth Circuits (as illustrated by these two cases) as well as the First Circuit, <i>Fasano v. Hall,</i> 615 F.2d 555, 558, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 867, 101 S.Ct. 201, 66 L.Ed.2d 86 (1980); the Second, <i>Edwards v. United States,</i> 564 F.2d 652, 654 (1977); the Eighth, <i>Shigemura v. United States,</i> 726 F.2d 380, 381 (1984); the Tenth, <i>Greathouse v. United States,</i> 655 F.2d 1032, 1034 (1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 926, 102 S.Ct. 1289, 71 L.Ed.2d 469 (1982);  and the Eleventh, <i>Seymore v. Alabama,</i> 846 F.2d 1355, 1356-1357 (1988).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Seventh Circuit has held that violations of the IAD are cognizable in federal habeas proceedings, <i>Webb v.

The Ninth Circuit has found that certain IAD violations are cognizable in federal habeas, while others are not.  Compare <i>Carlson v. Hong,</i> 707 F.2d 367, 368 (1983), with <i>Cody v.
