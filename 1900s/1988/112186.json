Since we granted the stay without knowing the precise nature of those remarks (neither party quoted them to us), we do not know whether the statements made at Daughterty's sentencing hearing were any different from those made at Preston's.  Given this uncertainty, we are hardly in a position to deny Daugherty's application for a stay on the ground that Preston's <i>Caldwell</i> claim, <i>Caldwell v. Mississippi,</i> 472 U.S. 320, 105 S.Ct. 2633, 86 L.Ed.2d 231 (1985), was more substantial than Daugherty's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the prosecutor told that jury that its verdict was \"advisory,\" that the trial judge had the \"final say\" as to the sentence, and that the judge \"is the last person who will consider what the penalty is going to be\" and thus serves as a \"buffer\" to make sure that mistakes do not occur.  Application 17.  Several cases that we have held for <i>Adams</i> present facts strikingly similar to these.  In <i>Ford v. Dugger,</i> No. 88-5582, for example, the judge told the jury several times that its sentence was \"advisory\" and \"not binding on the court.\"  Pet. for Cert. in No. 88-5582, p. 11. In <i>Spisak v. Ohio,</i> No. 88-5169, the judge stated that the jury's recommendation was \"just that, a recommendation,\" and that \"the final decision is placed by law upon the court.\"  Pet. for Cert. in No. 88-5169, p. 15.  The jury in <i>Grossman v. Florida,</i> No. 88-5136, learned from the prosecutor that the \"judge is the one\" who makes the sentencing decision and \"ultimately passes sentence,\" that the jury's \"recommendation to him is that only, a recommendation,\" and that \"the judge will do that\" (that is, impose the sentence of death), Pet. for Cert. in No. 88-5136, p. 10;  in response, the judge told the jury:  \"As you have been told, the final decision as to what punishment shall be imposed is the responsibility of the judge.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 11.  Finally, in <i>Harich v. Dugger,</i> No. 88-5216, the judge told the jury that its verdict was merely a \"recommendation to the Court,\" that the court \"pronounces whatever sentence it sees fit,\" that \"the penalty is for the court to decide,\" and that the \"final decision as to . . . punishment . . . rests solely upon the judge.\"  Brief in Opposition in No. 88-5216, p. 3.
