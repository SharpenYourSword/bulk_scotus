On April 23, 1987, at the request of the defendants, the District Court entered an order restraining the prosecutors, defendants, and defense counsel from making extrajudicial statements to the press.  The Government initially concurred in the order but eventually joined with petitioners, the news agencies, in seeking to have the order vacated.  On July 10, 1987, the District Court modified its order to allow the parties to state, without elaboration, matters of public record and to explain, without characterization, the substance of any motion or step in the proceedings.

Because only the news agencies opposed the restraining order, the court concluded that a prior restraint had not been imposed.
