Toward that end, we have struck down state laws and instructions that prevent a jury from considering any mitigating aspect of a capital defendant's character or background.  See, <i>e.g., Hitchcock v. Dugger,</i> 481 U.S. 393, 107 S.Ct. 1821, 95 L.Ed.2d 347 (1987);  <i>Lockett v.

Indeed, the California Supreme Court has conceded in the instant case, in <i>Brown, supra,</i> and in <i>People v.

At no time, furthermore, did the prosecutor or defense counsel suggest that the jurors had discretion in sentencing once they had decided that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating ones.  Indeed, the prosecutor expressly reminded the jurors that they had promised during <i>voir dire</i> that they would automatically impose a death sentence if they found that the evidence in aggravation outweighed that in mitigation.
