Freeman is a producer and director of pornographic films who hired and paid adults to perform sexual acts before his film cameras.  In 1983, Freeman was arrested and charged with five counts of pandering based on the hiring of five such performers. He was not charged with violation of any of California's obscenity laws.  Freeman was tried before a jury and convicted on all five counts of pandering;  the State Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of conviction.  198 Cal.App.3d 292, 233 Cal.Rptr. 510 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On discretionary review, the California Supreme Court first considered the relevant statutory language of the State Penal Code.  In relevant part, &#167; 266i of the Penal Code provides that a person is guilty of felonious pandering if that person \"procure[s] another person for the purpose of prostitution. . . .\" Prostitution, in turn, is defined in &#167; 647(b) of the Penal Code as \"any lewd act between persons for money or other consideration.\" Finally, \" 'for a \"lewd\" or \"dissolute\" act to constitute \"prostitution,\" the genitals, buttocks, or female breast, of either the prostitute or the customer must come in contact with some part of the body of the other for the purpose of <i>sexual arousal or gratification of the customer or of the prostitute.</i>' \" 46 Cal.3d, at 424, 250 Cal.Rptr., at 600, 758 P.2d, at 1130 (emphasis in original), quoting <i>People v.
