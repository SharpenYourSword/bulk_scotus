The Supreme Court of Georgia reversed on the grounds that the jury might actually have convicted Crawford not of murder but felony murder, a crime not charged in the indictment.  On retrial, Crawford's attorney filed a motion for change of venue, which was denied.  He also objected to the seating of any juror who had knowledge of the prior proceeding.  This motion was also denied. According to the petition in this case, of the 90 venirepersons, 57 indicated that they were aware of the prior proceedings, 50 indicated that they knew that Crawford had been convicted, and 32 knew that the first jury had sentenced him to death.  The jury that was finally empaneled contained eight persons who knew about the prior trial;  five who knew that Crawford had been convicted, and three who knew that he had been sentenced to death.
