This argument is hardly frivolous. The prosecutor at petitioner's trial described at some length the devastating emotional impact upon the mother of the man petitioner killed.  He told the jury, among other things, that petitioner \"shattered some other lives psychologically\";  that the victim's mother has \"repeated nightmares, crying, and I can see the crying for myself.  Extremely emotionally traumatic\";  and that petitioner \"[n]ever thought about the victims.  Never gave the families of the victims, a thought.\"  The Nevada Supreme Court, however, refused to consider the merits of this <i>Booth</i> claim.

Petitioner should not be penalized for not being prescient.  As for the Nevada court's second ground for rejecting petitioner's appeal, I believe that the issue whether Booth should have retroactive operation very much warrants this Court's attention.
