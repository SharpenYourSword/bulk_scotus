During jury deliberations, only one juror held out:  an elderly woman who refused to vote to impose the death penalty.  After a day of deliberations, another juror rose out of his chair and verbally attacked her in a tirade that apparently included a death threat. <i>Id.,</i> at 545, 250 Cal.Rptr., at 594, 758 P.2d, at 1125.

The judge told the jurors that he was sending them home for the weekend so that they could search their consciences.
