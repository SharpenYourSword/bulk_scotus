The attorney offered literally no evidence in mitigation.  This inaction cannot be explained by a dearth of potentially mitigating evidence.  On the contrary, the attorney knew of, but failed to investigate, a number of facts about petitioner on which quite credible arguments in mitigation could have been made.  Petitioner told his attorney, for example, that he had fought for this country in Vietnam and received an honorable discharge from the Army.  863 F.2d, at 1396 (dissenting opinion).
