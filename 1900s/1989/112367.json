The instructions in this case&#8212;that the juries could sentence petitioner to life if they believed from \"all the evidence\" that the death penalty was not justified&#8212;were simply insufficient to inform the juries of their duty to consider factors in mitigation.  Nor did the verdict form correct this error, as it merely stated in boilerplate language that the juries had \"considered evidence in mitigation of the offense.\"  Although the instructions did not <i>preclude</i> consideration of relevant mitigating evidence, neither did they \"clearly inform\" the juries that they were required to consider such evidence.  This situation creates an unacceptable risk that the juries did not consider \" 'factors which may call for a less severe penalty.' \"  See <i>Penry, supra,</i> 492 U.S., at 328, 109 S.Ct. at 2952.

See <i>Franklin v.

If it is possible for judges to misconstrue the term and exclude relevant mitigating evidence, see <i>Eddings v. Oklahoma,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110641\"><a href=\"/opinion/110641/eddings-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, at 113-114, 102 S.Ct. 869, at 876-877, 71 L.Ed.2d 1, it seems probable that a jury operating without adequate guidance could do the same.  The imposition of the death penalty should not be contingent on a particular jury's unguided understanding of a legal term of art. When a trial court refuses to give content to the words on which a defendant's life depends, the subsequent sentence is arbitrary and capricious.  I therefore dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
