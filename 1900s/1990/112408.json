In refusing to review the decision below, this Court sanctions a grave departure from our precedents by a panel of a court with a major role in the administration of this Nation's death penalty law.  Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondent does not dispute the basic rule that a State may not sentence to death a defendant \"who does not himself kill, attempt to kill, or intend that a killing take place,\" <i>Enmund, supra,</i> 458 U.S., at 797, 102 S.Ct., at 3376, unless that defendant was a major participant in a felony and exhibited reckless indifference to human life, <i>Tison, supra,</i> 481 U.S., at 158, 107 S.Ct., at 1688.  Nor does respondent suggest that a federal court may make the required finding.  Instead, the issue in this case is whether a state court's conclusion that \"there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found [Smith] guilty of premeditated murder,\" <i>Smith v. State,</i> 424 So.2d 726, 733 (1983), constitutes the culpability finding required by our cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The entirety of the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning on this point is that \"[i]mplicit in [the Florida Supreme Court's sufficiency] finding is the conclusion that Smith had the intent to kill.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502371\"><a href=\"/opinion/502371/frank-smith-v-richard-l-dugger/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">787</span></a></span>, 793 (1988).  Simply asserting a conclusion is hardly sufficient to justify it, especially where, as here, the conclusion is so plainly far-fetched.  The Florida court's finding that the evidence was sufficient for Smith's jury to find him guilty of premeditated murder is nothing more than a finding that reasonable people <i>could</i> have found that verdict justified;  it is emphatically not a finding that this jury <i>did</i> determine that Smith's acts were premeditated.  Indeed, the <i>Cabana</i> Court rejected as insufficient a state court's statement far more conclusive than the one here.  There, the Mississippi Supreme Court found that \" '[t]he evidence [was] overwhelming that [defendant] was an active participant in the assault and homicide.' \"  <i>Cabana,</i> 474 U.S., at 389, 106 S.Ct., at 698. Although this finding was \"sufficient to make [the defendant] liable for the murder and deserving of the death penalty in light of Mississippi law,\" it did not satisfy the Eighth Amendment. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the Florida court did not make the required finding is particularly apparent from an examination of its opinion as a whole.  In response to an unrelated guilt-phase point of error, the court found that Smith could have been found guilty and sentenced to death on either of two theories, one of which was the felony-murder doctrine.  424 So.2d, at 731.  \"Under this theory the jury would not have needed to conclude that [Smith] had the requisite intent.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 731-732.  The Florida Supreme Court's sufficiency determination thus in no way establishes that Smith's jury found the essential factual predicate to a death verdict under <i>Enmund,</i> especially in light of the court's acknowledgement that the jury was instructed that it could convict Smith regardless of his intent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is tempting to view the Eleventh Circuit's ruling in this case as an unfortunate aberration that should be disregarded as such.  Perhaps such a hope has informed this Court's decision to deny certiorari.  Nonetheless, the refusal to review the decision below has important consequences.  A panel of a Court of Appeals with jurisdiction over the death penalty statutes of three States has equated a state appellate court's finding that there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could have found intent to kill with a finding that the defendant did in fact intend to kill. The panel came to that conclusion notwithstanding that the jury was instructed that it could return a sentence of death even if it did <i>not</i> believe that Smith had the requisite intent.  Sufficiency of the evidence claims are routinely made in state death penalty appeals, and state appellate courts invariably will have to make a sufficiency finding in the course of their review.  To permit such a finding to satisfy <i>Enmund, Cabana,</i> and <i>Tison</i> is to eviscerate their protections.  Because I do not think it seemly or sensible for this Court to permit a significant violation of the Eighth Amendment to stand, simply on the hope that it will have no effect beyond the immediate case, I dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if I did not believe that this case otherwise merited review, I would adhere to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, <i>Gregg v.
