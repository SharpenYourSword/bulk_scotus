(National) is principally engaged in the business of producing and selling coal.  Among its other activities, National mines coal in Kentucky and Pennsylvania and sells it wholesale in West Virginia.  During the period relevant here, West Virginia imposed a gross receipts tax on wholesale sales of tangible property.  W.Va.Code &#167; 11-13-2c (1983).  Local producers were subject to taxes on their production activities, but exempt from the tax on wholesale activities.  &#167; 11-13-2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 22, 1980, the State Tax Department of West Virginia assessed $475,345.02 in business and occupation tax (plus interest and penalties) for the period January 1, 1975, through December 31, 1979, on National's wholesale sales of coal in West Virginia.  National filed a petition for reassessment, asserting that the tax violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.  The State Tax Commissioner upheld the assessment, concluding that the tax was fairly apportioned, that the measure of the tax was reasonably related to the benefits conferred by the State, and that the tax did not discriminate against interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days before National appealed to the State Circuit Court, this Court issued its opinion in <i>Armco Inc. v. Hardesty,</i> 467 U.S. 638, 104 S.Ct. 2620, 81 L.Ed.2d 540 (1984), which held that the West Virginia business and occupation tax sought to be collected from petitioner was unconstitutional.  National's action was held in abeyance while the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals considered a similar challenge to the state tax in light of <i>Armco.</i>  See <i>Ashland Oil, Inc. v.
