United States,</i> 494 U.S. ----, 110 S.Ct. 1800, 108 L.Ed.2d 931 (1990).  In <i>Chappell,</i> the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit had held that the defendant was barred from raising a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in a &#167; 2255 motion because he had been represented by new counsel on direct appeal and therefore could have raised the claim at that time. <i>Chappell v. United States,</i> 878 F.2d 384 (1989) (judgment order). In response to the petition for certiorari, the Solicitor General submitted a brief on behalf of the United States which stated that it was the position of the United States that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel ordinarily should be raised for the first time on collateral attack under &#167; 2255 rather than on direct appeal.  The Solicitor General further stated that where claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel are to be raised in a &#167; 2255 motion, a failure to raise such a claim should not constitute procedural default. The Court granted the petition for certiorari in <i>Chappell,</i> vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remanded to that court for further consideration in light of the position taken by the United States in its brief. 494 U.S. ----, 110 S.Ct. 1800, 108 L.Ed.2d 931 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the Court of Appeals denied the petition for rehearing without requesting a response from the United States. Petitioner then filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that we should grant the petition, vacate the judgment of the Tenth Circuit, and remand for further consideration in light of the position taken by the United States in <i>Chappell.</i>  However, in its brief for the United States in opposition, the Solicitor General recommended that the Court <i>deny</i> the petition.  The Solicitor General asserted that this case was distinguishable from <i>Chappell</i> because \"[h]ere, a hearing was held in the district court, in connection with petitioner's motion for a new trial, on the circumstances surrounding the actions of trial counsel that form the basis for petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and the record therefore would have enabled petitioner's new counsel to raise the issue on direct appeal.\"  Brief in Opposition 9.  The Solicitor General concluded that \"[b]ecause the record that was developed in the district court apparently would have been adequate for the court of appeals to address the ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim if petitioner had raised it on direct appeal, and because there was no impediment to petitioner's doing so (since he was represented by new counsel on appeal), the holding by the court below that petitioner is barred from raising his Sixth Amendment claim on collateral attack in the particular circumstances of this case is neither unreasonable nor unfair.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I have previously questioned the wisdom of automatically vacating a Court of Appeals judgment favorable to the Government when the Solicitor General confesses error in this Court, See <i>Mariscal v.
