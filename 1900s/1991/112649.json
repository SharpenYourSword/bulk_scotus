See 923 F.2d, at 572-573.  Purporting to draw on the majority opinion in <i>Ford</i> and on Justice Powell's concurring opinion, the Court of Appeals concluded that the only considerations relevant to petitioner's competency were \"(1) whether petitioner understands <i>that</i> he is to be punished by execution;  and (2) whether petitioner understands <i>why</i> he is being punished.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 572 (emphasis added).  Because the medical examiners had determined that petitioner was competent to be executed by these criteria, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's denial of habeas relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower courts clearly erred in viewing <i>Ford</i> as settling the issue whether a prisoner can be deemed competent to be executed notwithstanding his inability to recognize or communicate facts showing his sentence to be unlawful or unjust.  Although the Court in <i>Ford</i> did emphasize the injustice \"of executing a person who has no comprehension of why he has been singled out and stripped of his fundamental right to life,\" 477 U.S., at 409, 106 S.Ct., at 2601, the Court stressed that this was just one of many conditions that were treated as rendering a prisoner incompetent (or insane) at common law, see <i>id.,</i> at 407-408, 409-410, 106 S.Ct., at 2600-2601, 2601-2602.  Indeed, the Court quoted with approval Blackstone's discussion of this topic, which clearly treats as a bar to execution a prisoner's inability to recognize grounds for avoiding the sentence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\" '[I]f, after judgment, [a capital prisoner] becomes of      nonsane memory, execution shall be stayed:  for peradventure,      says the humanity of the English law, <i>had the prisoner been      of sound memory, he might have alleged something in stay of      judgment or execution.' \"</i>  <i>Id.,</i> at 407, 106 S.Ct., at 2600      (emphasis added), quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries      *24-*25 (1769).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, as the Court of Appeals noted, that Justice Powell addressed and rejected this definition of incompetence in his concurring opinion.  See 477 U.S., at 419-421, 106 S.Ct., at 2606-2608.  But even he recognized that the full Court left the issue open.  See <i>id.,</i> at 418, 106 S.Ct., at 2606 (noting that Court does not resolve \"the meaning of insanity in this context\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, a strong argument can be made that Justice Powell's answer to this open question is the wrong one.  As we have emphasized, the Eighth Amendment prohibits any punishment considered cruel and unusual at common law as well as any punishment contrary to \"the 'evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.' \"  <i>Penry v.

The stark realities are that many death row inmates were afflicted with serious mental impairments before they committed their crimes and that many more develop such impairments during the excruciating interval between sentencing and execution.  See Lewis, Pincus, Feldman, Jackson &amp; Bard, Psychiatric, Neurological, and Psychoeducational Characteristics of 15 Death Row Inmates in the United States, 143 Am.J. Psychiatry 838, 840-841 (1986);  Johnson, Under Sentence of Death:  The Psychology of Death Row Confinement, 5 Law &amp; Psychology Rev. 141, 176-181 (1979);  Gallemore &amp; Panton, Inmate Response to Lengthy Death Row Confinement, 129 Am.J. Psychiatry 167, 168, 169 (1972). Unavoidably, then, the question whether such persons can be put to death once the deterioration of their faculties has rendered them unable even to appeal to the law or the compassion of the society that has condemned them is central to the administration of the death penalty in this Nation.  I would therefore grant the petition for certiorari in order to resolve <i>now</i> the questions left unanswered by our decision in <i>Ford v.

See <i>Ford v. Wainwright,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111725\"><a href=\"/opinion/111725/ford-v-wainwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span>, 419, 106 S.Ct. 2595, 2606, 91 L.Ed.2d 335 (1986) (concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). Instead, he reasoned that the advent of increased opportunities for direct and collateral review of criminal convictions had so reduced the possibility of undiscovered error as to render this conception obsolete.  See <i>id.,</i> at 420-421, 106 S.Ct., at 2607-2608.  This view strikes me not only as inconsistent with the established principle \"that the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment embraces, <i>at a minimum,</i> those modes or acts of punishment that had been considered cruel and unusual at the time that the Bill of Rights was adopted,\" <i>id.,</i> at 405, 106 S.Ct., at 2599 (emphasis added);  accord, <i>Penry v.

For if a prisoner is incapable of recognizing or communicating facts that would facilitate collateral review, there is no reason to assume that collateral review in his case has rooted out all trial errors.  In addition, Justice Powell's argument seems to miss at least half the point of the common law conception of incompetence.  This definition focuses not only on the prisoner's capacity to recognize and communicate facts showing that his sentence is <i>unlawful,</i> but also on his capacity to recognize and communicate facts showing that his sentence is <i>unjust.</i>  Absent this capacity, the prisoner is unable to participate in efforts to seek executive clemency, see, <i>e.g.,</i> Mo.Ann.Stat. &#167; 552.060.1 (Supp.1991), the appropriateness of which will not necessarily be disclosed in the course of direct or collateral review of the prisoner's conviction.  Ultimately, then, the common law conception of incompetence embodies the principle that it is inhumane to put a man to death when he has been rendered incapable of appealing to the mercy of the society that has condemned him.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Although the Court in <i>Ford</i> did emphasize the injustice \"of executing a person who has no comprehension of why he has been singled out and stripped of his fundamental right to life,\" 477 U.S., at 409, 106 S.Ct., at 2601, the Court stressed that this was just one of many conditions that were treated as rendering a prisoner incompetent (or insane) at common law, see <i>id.,</i> at 407-408, 409-410, 106 S.Ct., at 2600-2601, 2601-2602.  Indeed, the Court quoted with approval Blackstone's discussion of this topic, which clearly treats as a bar to execution a prisoner's inability to recognize grounds for avoiding the sentence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\" '[I]f, after judgment, [a capital prisoner] becomes of      nonsane memory, execution shall be stayed:  for peradventure,      says the humanity of the English law, <i>had the prisoner been      of sound memory, he might have alleged something in stay of      judgment or execution.' \"</i>  <i>Id.,</i> at 407, 106 S.Ct., at 2600      (emphasis added), quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries      *24-*25 (1769).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, as the Court of Appeals noted, that Justice Powell addressed and rejected this definition of incompetence in his concurring opinion.  See 477 U.S., at 419-421, 106 S.Ct., at 2606-2608.  But even he recognized that the full Court left the issue open.  See <i>id.,</i> at 418, 106 S.Ct., at 2606 (noting that Court does not resolve \"the meaning of insanity in this context\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, a strong argument can be made that Justice Powell's answer to this open question is the wrong one.  As we have emphasized, the Eighth Amendment prohibits any punishment considered cruel and unusual at common law as well as any punishment contrary to \"the 'evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.' \"  <i>Penry v. Lynaugh,</i> 492 U.S. 302, 330-331, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 2953, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989), quoting <i>Trop v. Dulles,</i> 356 U.S. 86, 101, 78 S.Ct. 590, 598, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958) (plurality opinion);  accord, <i>Stanford v. Kentucky,</i> 492 U.S. 361, 368-369, 109 S.Ct. 2969, 2974-2975, 106 L.Ed.2d 306 (1989);  <i>Ford v. Wainwright, supra,</i> 477 U.S., at 405-406, 106 S.Ct., at 2599-2600.  The common law's hostility to putting a man to death under such circumstances is documented not only by Blackstone, see 4 W. Blackstone, <i>supra,</i> *24-*25, *388-*389, but also by other commentators on English common law, see 1 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 35 (1736), and by numerous early American decisions, see <i>State v. Helm,</i> 69 Ark. 167, 171-173, 61 S.W. 915, 916-917 (1901);  <i>People v.

The stark realities are that many death row inmates were afflicted with serious mental impairments before they committed their crimes and that many more develop such impairments during the excruciating interval between sentencing and execution.  See Lewis, Pincus, Feldman, Jackson &amp; Bard, Psychiatric, Neurological, and Psychoeducational Characteristics of 15 Death Row Inmates in the United States, 143 Am.J. Psychiatry 838, 840-841 (1986);  Johnson, Under Sentence of Death:  The Psychology of Death Row Confinement, 5 Law &amp; Psychology Rev. 141, 176-181 (1979);  Gallemore &amp; Panton, Inmate Response to Lengthy Death Row Confinement, 129 Am.J. Psychiatry 167, 168, 169 (1972). Unavoidably, then, the question whether such persons can be put to death once the deterioration of their faculties has rendered them unable even to appeal to the law or the compassion of the society that has condemned them is central to the administration of the death penalty in this Nation.  I would therefore grant the petition for certiorari in order to resolve <i>now</i> the questions left unanswered by our decision in <i>Ford v. Wainwright.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, <i>Gregg v. Georgia,</i> 428 U.S. 153, 231, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2973, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would grant the petition and vacate the death sentence even if I did not view the issue in this case as being independently worthy of this Court's plenary review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> ABA Standard 7-5.6(b) provides:</p>\n        <p>\"A convict is incompetent to be executed if, as a result of mental illness or mental retardation, the convict cannot understand the nature of the pending proceedings, what he or she was tried for, the reason for the punishment, or the nature of the punishment.  A convict is also incompetent if, as a result of mental illness or mental retardation, <i>the convict lacks sufficient capacity to recognize or understand any fact which might exist which would make the punishment unjust or unlawful, or lacks the ability to convey such information to counsel or to the court.\"</i> ABA Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards 7-5.6(b) (1989) (emphasis added).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Justice Powell did not dispute the established status of this definition of incompetence at common law.  See <i>Ford v. Wainwright,</i> 477 U.S. 399, 419, 106 S.Ct. 2595, 2606, 91 L.Ed.2d 335 (1986) (concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). Instead, he reasoned that the advent of increased opportunities for direct and collateral review of criminal convictions had so reduced the possibility of undiscovered error as to render this conception obsolete.  See <i>id.,</i> at 420-421, 106 S.Ct., at 2607-2608.  This view strikes me not only as inconsistent with the established principle \"that the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment embraces, <i>at a minimum,</i> those modes or acts of punishment that had been considered cruel and unusual at the time that the Bill of Rights was adopted,\" <i>id.,</i> at 405, 106 S.Ct., at 2599 (emphasis added);  accord, <i>Penry v. Lynaugh,</i> 492 U.S. 302, 330, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 2953, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989), but also as somewhat question begging.  For if a prisoner is incapable of recognizing or communicating facts that would facilitate collateral review, there is no reason to assume that collateral review in his case has rooted out all trial errors.  In addition, Justice Powell's argument seems to miss at least half the point of the common law conception of incompetence.  This definition focuses not only on the prisoner's capacity to recognize and communicate facts showing that his sentence is <i>unlawful,</i> but also on his capacity to recognize and communicate facts showing that his sentence is <i>unjust.</i>  Absent this capacity, the prisoner is unable to participate in efforts to seek executive clemency, see, <i>e.g.,</i> Mo.Ann.Stat. &#167; 552.060.1 (Supp.1991), the appropriateness of which will not necessarily be disclosed in the course of direct or collateral review of the prisoner's conviction.  Ultimately, then, the common law conception of incompetence embodies the principle that it is inhumane to put a man to death when he has been rendered incapable of appealing to the mercy of the society that has condemned him.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
