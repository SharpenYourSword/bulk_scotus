Jerome Hiersche, a professional diver, contracted with the Government to inspect submerged fish screens at the hydroelectric intake on the John Day Dam on the Columbia River between Oregon and Washington.  Although Government employees assured him that the water flow to the fish bypass system would be shut off, they negligently failed to do so.  Petitioner's head was drawn into an orifice in the fish bypass system, and he suffered fatal injuries. The Government defended this wrongful death action on the ground that the 1928 Act immunizes it from liability for all personal injuries caused by its employees in federal flood-control projects.  Following this Court's unfortunate decision in <i>James,</i> as well as settled precedent in the Ninth Circuit,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the District Court and the Court of Appeals sustained that defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since 1928 when Congress authorized the construction of the levees on the banks of the Mississippi River, the number and importance of federal flood-control projects has grown dramatically.  In addition to controlling floods, these projects generate hydroelectric power and create artificial lakes that serve important recreational and conservation purposes.  In some Circuits the Government's flood-control immunity would not constitute a defense in the case of injuries resulting from Government conduct that was unrelated to any flood-control purpose, see, <i>e.g., Boyd v. United States ex rel. United States Army, Corps of Engineers,</i> 881 F.2d 895 (CA10 1989);  <i>Hayes v. United States,</i> 585 F.2d 701 (CA4 1978).  If this case had arisen in one of those Circuits, the claim would likely succeed because Hiersche's assignment related to fish conservation and power generation, rather than flood control.  But in the Ninth Circuit, if flood control was one of the purposes of the act of Congress authorizing the project itself, the immunity applies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The Seventh Circuit has suggested that immunity might depend on whether the flood-control activities at the project increased the probability of injury.
