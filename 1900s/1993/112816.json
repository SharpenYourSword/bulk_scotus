Driving under the influence (DUI) is a class B misdemeanor and carries a maximum penalty of six months' imprisonment, &#167; 1.3(a); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3581(b)(7), and a $5,000 fine, &#167;&#167; 3571(b)(6) and (e). As an alternative to a term of imprisonment, the sentencing court may impose a term of probation not to exceed five years.  &#167;&#167; 3561(a)(3), (b)(2).

He reasoned that because DUI carries a maximum term of imprisonment of six months, it is presumptively a \"petty\" offense which is not embraced by the jury trial guaranty of the Sixth Amendment.  He rejected respondent's contention that the additional penalties transformed DUI into a \"serious\" offense for Sixth Amendment purposes.  Respondent was then tried by the Magistrate Judge and convicted of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol in violation of 36 CFR &#167; 4.23(a)(1) (1992).

C. § 3, Congress set six months as the maximum penalty the Secretary could impose for a violation of any of his regulations. The Court of Appeals offered no persuasive reason why this congressional determination is stripped of its \"legislative\" character merely because the Secretary has final authority to decide, within the limits given by Congress, what the maximum prison sentence will be for a violation of a given regulation.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> The additional penalties imposed under the regulations are not sufficiently severe to overcome this presumption. As we noted in <i>Blanton,</i> it is a rare case where \"a legislature packs an offense it deems `serious' with onerous penalties that nonetheless do not puncture the 6-month incarceration line.\" <i>Blanton,</i> 489 U. S., at 543 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the federal DUI offense carries a maximum fine of $5,000, and respondent faced, as an alternative to incarceration, a maximum 5-year term of probation. While the maximum fine in this case is $4,000 greater than the one in <i>Blanton,</i> this monetary penalty \"cannot approximate in severity the loss of liberty that a prison term entails.\" <i>Id.,</i>  at 542.</p>\n<p>Nor do we believe that the probation alternative renders the DUI offense \"serious.\"<sup>[*]</sup> Like a monetary penalty, the liberty infringement caused by a term of probation is far less intrusive than incarceration. <i>Ibid.</i> The discretionary probation conditions do not alter this conclusion; while they obviously entail a greater infringement on liberty than probation without attendant conditions, they do not approximate the severe loss of liberty caused by imprisonment for more than six months.</p>\n<p>We hold that the Court of Appeals was wrong in refusing to recognize that this case was controlled by our opinion in <i>Blanton</i> rather than by its previous opinion in <i>Craner.</i> An individual convicted of driving under the influence in violation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> of 36 CFR § 4.23(a)(1) (1992) is not constitutionally entitled to a jury trial. The petition of the United States for certiorari is accordingly granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i> </p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   There are 21 discretionary conditions which the sentencing court may impose upon a defendant. Under 18 U. S. C. § 3563(b),a court may require, among other things, that the defendant (1) pay restitution; (2) take part in a drug and alcohol dependency program offered by an institution, and if necessary, reside at the institution; (3) remain in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons during nights and weekends for a period not exceeding the term of imprisonment; (4) reside at or participate in a program of a community correctional facility for all or part of the probationary term; or (5) remain at his place of residence during nonworking hours, and, if necessary, this condition may be monitored by telephonic or electronic devices. §§ 3563(b)(3), (b)(10), (b)(11), (b)(12), (b)(20).</p>\n\n</div>", "id": 112816, "judges": "Per Curiam", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/112816/", "sha1": "cc300827413ee9fff1629822b87205f50ef50fa4", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": "1992-027", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T10:13:56"}
