We deny this request pursuant to Rule 39.8. Sassower is allowed until November 2, 1993, within which to pay the docketing fees required by Rule 38 and to submit his petitions in compliance with this Court's Rule 33. For the reasons explained below, we also direct the Clerk not to accept any further petitions for certiorari nor any petitions for extraordinary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> writs from Sassower in noncriminal matters unless he pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.</p>\n<p>Prior to this Term, Sassower had filed 11 petitions in this Court over the last three years. Although Sassower was granted <i>in forma pauperis</i> status to file these petitions, all were denied without recorded dissent.<sup>[*]</sup> During the last four months, Sassower has suddenly increased his filings. He currently has 10 petitions pending before this Court\u0097all of them patently frivolous.</p>\n<p>Although we have not previously denied Sassower <i>in forma pauperis</i> status pursuant to Rule 39.8, we think it appropriate to enter an order pursuant to <i>Martin</i> v. <i>District of Columbia Court of Appeals,</i> 506 U.

For the important reasons discussed in <i>Martin, Sindram,</i> and <i>McDonald,</i> we feel compelled to enter the order today barring prospective filings from Sassower.</p>\n<p>Sassower's abuse of the writ of certiorari and of the extraordinary writs has been in noncriminal cases, and so we limit our sanction accordingly. The order therefore will not prevent Sassower from petitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed on him.
