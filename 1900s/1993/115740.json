See <i>Burger</i> v. <i>Kemp,</i> 483 U. S. 776, 796 (1987) (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting). His lawyer's direct conflict of interest prevented him from representing Mr. Burger effectively in plea negotiations and on appeal. Just as egregiously, his counsel inexplicably failed to investigate and to present mitigating evidence &#8212; evidence that would have shown that 17-year-old Chris Burger had a diminished mental capacity, functioning at the level of a 12-year-old child, and that the unspeakable physical and psychological abuse he suffered as a child left him a troubled adolescent, with recurring psychological problems. These shortcomings by counsel, which were never remedied, leave me convinced that Mr. Burger's conviction, sentencing proceeding, and appeal cannot \"be relied on as having produced a just result.\" <i>Strickland</i> v. <i>Washington,</i> 466 U.
