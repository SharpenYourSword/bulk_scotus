Our concern, however, is \"not what the State Supreme Court declares the meaning of the [poll question] to be, but rather what a reasonable juror could have understood the [poll question] as meaning.\"  <i>Francis v.

It is equally plausible that a reasonable juror could have interpreted \"Is this your answer?\" to mean \"Is this your, <i>the jury's,</i> answer?\"  Since the jurors had been instructed that they could answer \"yes\" only if they unanimously agreed, a juror's answer to the poll question easily could have meant, \"Yes, that was our answer, because we could not achieve unanimity on the existence of that factor.\"  Or even if the juror was answering for himself, he could be saying \"Yes, that was my answer, but only because I could not get the others unanimously to agree that this mitigating circumstance existed.\"  Jurors are presumed to follow their instructions.  See <i>e.g., Yates v.

A finding of harmlessness is warranted only if it appears \"beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\"  <i>Chapman v.

Because the unanimity instruction preceded and shaped the jury's consideration of mitigating evidence, it may have contributed to the verdict by directing the jury to \"examin[e] the evidence with the wrong question in mind.\"  <i>Yates v. Evatt, supra,</i> 500 U.S., at 413, 111 S.Ct., at 1898 (SCALIA, J., concurring).  The poll tells us nothing about how the juror would have voted&#8212;either on a particular mitigating circumstance or on the ultimate life-or-death question&#8212;had he been instructed that he could give effect to all the mitigating evidence, as the Constitution requires.  Thus, the state court's analysis does not satisfy the \"high standard\" of harmlessness for federal constitutional error. See <i>Sochor v. Florida,</i> --- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 2114, 2123, 119 L.Ed.2d 326 (1992) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring);  see also <i>Clemons v.

See 331 N.C., at 628, 418 S.E.2d, at 173.  Concern that the <i>McKoy</i> instruction may have precluded consideration of relevant mitigating evidence is only fueled by the North Carolina Supreme Court's acknowledgement \"there [wa]s evidence which support[ed] several of the mitigating circumstances not found by the jury.\"  331 N.C., at 628, 418 S.E.2d, at 173.  <i>Cf.

On this remand, if the North Carolina Supreme Court concludes that there is <i>Simmons</i> error that requires resentencing, the new sentencing jurors will not receive the now-abandoned <i>McKoy</i> instruction, and the case will be purged of any existing nonharmless <i>McKoy</i> error.
