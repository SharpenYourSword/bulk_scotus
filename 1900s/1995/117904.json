Under this theory, no writ of habeas corpus ordering a change in the child's custody could be issued absent a full and fair hearing.  I accept the representation in footnote 5 of the Does' application that this claim was presented to the Illinois Supreme Court, at least as to the rights of the adoptive parents.  I must therefore assume that the state court passed upon this claim and that this Court has jurisdiction.  I have concluded, however, that the claim cannot succeed.  The underlying liberty interests the applicants claim have already been the subject of exhaustive proceedings in the Illinois courts, culminating in the Illinois Supreme Court's decision last year.  The result of those proceedings was a determination that the biological father was entitled to present custody.  The habeas corpus proceeding from which the adoptive parents now seek relief was an execution of the Court's prior decision, ordering the adoptive parents to surrender custody \"forthwith.\"  That order adjudicated no new substantive rights, but merely enforced the mandate of the prior decision.

I have no authority to review that Court's interpretation of the law of Illinois.  Finally, the regrettable facts that an Illinois court entered an erroneous adoption decree in 1992 and that the delay in correcting that error has had such unfortunate effects on innocent parties are, of course, not matters that I have any authority to consider in connection with the dispositions of the pending applications for federal relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, both stay applications are denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    ",
