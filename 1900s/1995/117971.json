During the trial, confusion and dispute arose over whether particular photographs which had been seen by the jury during a luncheon recess had actually been admitted into evidence or were merely marked for identification.  The prosecuting attorney's motion for a mistrial was granted by the trial court over respondents' objection, and the trial court calendared the case for a second trial starting July 17, 1995.  Between the first and the second trial, the trial court denied a motion by respondents to dismiss the charges on grounds of double jeopardy, and the Supreme Court of South Carolina dismissed respondents' appeal without ruling on its merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondents then sought habeas relief in federal court under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254, and sought to enjoin the imminent second trial pending final disposition of their habeas petition.  On July 11, 1995, six days before the second trial was to start, the District Court for the District of South Carolina refused to issue an injunction, and a panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's determination four days later, with one judge in dissent.  On July 20, three days into the trial, the Court of Appeals <i>en banc</i> granted respondents' request for a temporary restraining order, enjoined the state proceedings until the District Court ruled on respondents' habeas petition, and ordered the District Court to rule on the petition as expeditiously as possible.

(This order, though entered July 21, was not reduced to writing for another week.)  The District Court denied the State's application to stay the issuance of the writ on July 31, and the Court of Appeals denied a similar application on August 8.

Nothing I do now, several weeks later, can undo the interruption of the state trial, and I therefore decline to stay the District Court's order granting habeas relief to the extent that it enjoins the resumption of the state trial proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That portion of the District Court's order releasing respondents from custody, however, seems to me to stand on a different footing, and I believe that the State has met the traditional criteria for a stay of the enlargement of a prisoner in a habeas corpus proceeding.  The state trial court ruled against respondents' double jeopardy claims on the merits.  In <i>Arizona v. Washington,</i> 434 U.S. 497, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978), we held that one claiming double jeopardy by reason of a second trial must show that there was no \"manifest necessity\" for the trial court to grant the State's mistrial motion.  And we stated that the trial court's judgment about the necessity is entitled  to great deference, never more so than when the judgment is based on an evaluation of such factors as the admissibility of evidence, any prejudice caused by the introduction of such evidence, and the trial court's familiarity with the jurors.  <i>Id.,</i> at 513-514, 98 S.Ct., at 834-835.  <i>Washington</i> indicates that the State will be able to present at the least a substantial case on the merits on appeal, and the other traditional factors in a stay analysis counsel in favor of continued custody.
