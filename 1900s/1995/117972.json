In the fourth, the asserted reason was similar to that offered here:  counsel needed additional time \" 'to ensure that the important constitutional issues in [the] case are properly researched and presented to this Court.' \"  <i>Id.,</i> at 1302, 111 S.Ct., at 903.

I nonetheless granted extensions in the three cases where counsel had withdrawn, primarily because I was a new Circuit Justice, and was reluctant to impose without notice a standard more stringent, perhaps, than what the Fifth Circuit bar was accustomed to.
