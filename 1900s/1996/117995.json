Palm Beach Post,</i> 516 U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 416, 133 L.Ed.2d 334. At that time, Attwood had filed seven petitions in this Court during the prior year, and he has filed two since.

Attwood's abuse of the writ of certiorari has been in noncriminal cases, and so we limit our sanction accordingly.  The order will not prevent Attwood from petitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed against him.
