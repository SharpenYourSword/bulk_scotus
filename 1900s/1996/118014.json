Modla</i> and <i>Robert S. Phifer.</i><sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p>Justice Scalia, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case presents the question whether a plaintiff alleging that he was discharged in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 621 <i>et seq.,</i> must show that he was replaced by someone outside the age group protected by the ADEA to make out a prima facie case under the framework established by <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp.</i> v. <i>Green,</i> 411 U. S. 792 (1973).</p>\n<p>Petitioner James O'Connor was employed by respondent Consolidated Coin Caterers Corporation from 1978 until August 10, 1990, when, at age 56, he was fired. Claiming that he had been dismissed because of his age in violation of the ADEA, petitioner brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina. After discovery, the District Court granted respondent's motion for summary judgment, 829 F. Supp. 155 (1993), and petitioner <span class=\"star-pagination\">*310</span> appealed. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stated that petitioner could establish a prima facie case under <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> only if he could prove that (1) he was in the age group protected by the ADEA; (2) he was discharged or demoted; (3) at the time of his discharge or demotion, he was performing his job at a level that met his employer's legitimate expectations; and (4) following his discharge or demotion, he was replaced by someone of comparable qualifications outside the protected class. Since petitioner's replacement was 40 years old, the Court of Appeals concluded that the last element of the prima facie case had not been made out.<sup>[1]</sup> 56 F. 3d 542, 546 (1995). Finding that petitioner's claim could not survive a motion for summary judgment without benefit of the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> presumption (<i>i. e.,</i> \"under the ordinary standards of proof used in civil cases,\" 56 F. 3d, at 548), the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of dismissal. We granted O'Connor's petition for certiorari. 516 U. S. 973 (1995).</p>\n<p>In <i>McDonnell Douglas,</i> we \"established an allocation of the burden of production and an order for the presentation of proof in Title VII discriminatory-treatment cases.\" <i>St. Mary's Honor Center</i> v. <i>Hicks,</i> 509 U. S. 502, 506 (1993). We held that a plaintiff alleging racial discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e <i>et seq.,</i> could establish a prima facie case by showing \"(i) that he belongs to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of [the] complainant's qualifications.\" <i>McDonnell Douglas,</i>  <span class=\"star-pagination\">*311</span> 411 U. S., at 802. Once the plaintiff has met this initial burden, the burden of production shifts to the employer \"to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's rejection.\" <i>Ibid.</i> If the trier of fact finds that the elements of the prima facie case are supported by a preponderance of the evidence and the employer remains silent, the court must enter judgment for the plaintiff. <i>St. Mary's Honor Center, supra,</i> at 509-510, and n. 3; <i>Texas Dept. of</i>  <i>Community Affairs</i> v. <i>Burdine,</i> 450 U. S. 248, 254 (1981).</p>\n<p>In assessing claims of age discrimination brought under the ADEA, the Fourth Circuit, like others,<sup>[2]</sup> has applied some variant of the basic evidentiary framework set forth in <i>McDonnell Douglas.</i> We have never had occasion to decide whether that application of the Title VII rule to the ADEA context is correct, but since the parties do not contest that point, we shall assume it. Cf. <i>St. Mary's Honor Center, supra,</i> at 506, n. 1 (assuming that \"the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i>  framework is fully applicable to racial-discrimination-inemployment claims under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983\"). On that assumption, the question presented for our determination is what elements must be shown in an ADEA case to establish the prima facie case that triggers the employer's burden of production.</p>\n<p>As the very name \"prima facie case\" suggests, there must be at least a logical connection between each element of the prima facie case and the illegal discrimination for which it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*312</span> establishes a \"legally mandatory, rebuttable presumption,\" <i>Burdine, supra,</i> at 254, n. 7. The element of replacement by someone under 40 fails this requirement. The discrimination prohibited by the ADEA is discrimination \"because of [an] individual's age,\" 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 623(a)(1), though the prohibition is \"limited to individuals who are at least 40 years of age,\" \u00a7 631(a). This language does not ban discrimination against employees because they are aged 40 or older; it bans discrimination against employees because of their age, but limits the protected class to those who are 40 or older. The fact that one person in the protected class has lost out to another person in the protected class is thus irrelevant, so long as he has lost out <i>because of his age.</i> Or to put the point more concretely, there can be no greater inference of <i>age</i> discrimination (as opposed to \"40 or over\" discrimination) when a 40-year-old is replaced by a 39-year-old than when a 56-year-old is replaced by a 40-year-old. Because it lacks probative value, the fact that an ADEA plaintiff was replaced by someone outside the protected class is not a proper element of the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> prima facie case.</p>\n<p>Perhaps some courts have been induced to adopt the principle urged by respondent in order to avoid creating a prima facie case on the basis of very thin evidence\u0097for example, the replacement of a 68-year-old by a 65-year-old. While the respondent's principle theoretically permits such thin evidence (consider the example above of a 40-year-old replaced by a 39-year-old), as a practical matter it will rarely do so, since the vast majority of age-discrimination claims come from older employees. In our view, however, the proper solution to the problem lies not in making an utterly irrelevant factor an element of the prima facie case, but rather in recognizing that the prima facie case requires \"<i>evidence adequate to create an inference that an employment decision was based on a[n] [illegal] discriminatory criterion . . . .</i> \" <i>Teamsters</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 431 U. S. 324, 358 (1977) (emphasis <span class=\"star-pagination\">*313</span> added). In the age-discrimination context, such an inference cannot be drawn from the replacement of one worker with another worker insignificantly younger. Because the ADEA prohibits discrimination on the basis of age and not class membership, the fact that a replacement is substantially younger than the plaintiff is a far more reliable indicator of age discrimination than is the fact that the plaintiff was replaced by someone outside the protected class.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Fourth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i> </p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   <i>Steven S.

S. C.Section(s) 621 <i>et seq</i>., must show that he was replaced by someoneoutside the age group protected by the ADEA to make out a prima faciecase under the framework established by <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp.</i> v.<i>Green</i>, 411 U.

Supp. 155 (1993), and petitionerappealed.The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stated thatpetitioner could establish a prima facie case under McDonnell Douglasonly if he could prove that (1) he was in the age group protected by theADEA; (2) he was discharged or demoted; (3) at the time of his dischargeor demotion, he was performing his job at a level that met hisemployer's legitimate expectations; and (4) following his discharge ordemotion, he was replaced by someone of comparable qualificationsoutside the protected class.Since petitioner's replacement was 40years old, the Court of Appeals concluded that the last element of theprima facie case had not been made out.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>56 F. 3d 542, 546 (1995).Finding that petitioner's claim could not survive a motion for summaryjudgment without benefit of the McDonnell Douglas presumption (<i>i.e</i>.,\"under the ordinary standards of proof used in civil cases,\" 56 F. 3d,at 548), the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of dismissal.Wegranted O'Connor's petition for certiorari.516 U.

Section(s) 2000e <i>et seq</i>., could establish a primafacie case by showing \"(i) that he belongs to a racial minority; (ii)that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer wasseeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he wasrejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position remained openand the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of [the]complainant's qualifications.\"McDonnell Douglas, 411 U. S., at 802.Once the plaintiff has met this initial burden, the burden of productionshifts to the employer \"to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatoryreason for the employee's rejection.\" <i>Ibid.</i> If the trier of fact findsthat the elements of the prima facie case are supported by apreponderance of the evidence and the employer remains silent, the courtmust enter judgment for the plaintiff.  <i>St. Mary's Honor Center</i>, <i>supra</i>,at 509-510, and n. 3; <i>Texas Dept. of Community</i> <i>Affairs</i> v. <i>Burdine</i>, 450U.

S. C. Section(s) 1983\"). On that assumption, the question presentedfor our determination is what elements must be shown in an ADEA case toestablish the prima facie case that triggers the employer's burden ofproduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the very name \"prima facie case\" suggests, there must be atleast a logical connection between each element of the prima facie caseand the illegal discrimination for which it establishes a \"legallymandatory, rebuttable presumption,\" <i>Burdine</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 254, n. 7.Theelement of replacement by someone under 40 fails this requirement.Thediscrimination prohibited by the ADEA is discrimination \"because of [an]individual's age,\" 29 U. S. C. Section(s) 623(a)(1), though theprohibition is \"limited to individuals who are at least 40 years ofage,\" Section(s) 631(a). This language does not ban discriminationagainst employees because they are aged 40 or older; it bansdiscrimination against employees because of their age, but limits theprotected class to those who are 40 or older.The fact that one personin the protected class has lost out to another person in the protectedclass is thus irrelevant, so long as he has lost out because of his age.Or to put the point more concretely, there can be no greater inferenceof age discrimination (as opposed to \"40 or over\" discrimination) when a40 year-old is replaced by a 39 year-old than when a 56 year-old isreplaced by a 40 year-old.Because it lacks probative value, the factthat an ADEA plaintiff was replaced by someone outside the protectedclass is not a proper element of the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> prima facie case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps some courts have been induced to adopt the principleurged by respondent in order to avoid creating a prima facie case on thebasis of very thin evidence-for example, the replacement of a 68year-old by a 65 year-old.While the respondent's principletheoretically permits such thin evidence (consider the example above ofa 40 year-old replaced by a 39 year-old), as a practical matter it willrarely do so, since the vast majority of age-discrimination claims comefrom older employees.In our view, however, the proper solution to theproblem lies not in making an utterly irrelevant factor an element ofthe prima facie case, but rather in recognizing that the prima faciecase requires \"<i>evidence adequate to create an inference that anemployment decision was based on a[n] [illegal] discriminatory criterion</i>. . . .\"<i>Teamsters</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 431 U. S. 324, 358 (1977)(emphasis added).In the age-discrimination context, such an inferencecan not be drawn from the replacement of one worker with another workerinsignificantly younger.Because the ADEA prohibits discrimination onthe basis of age and not class membership, the fact that a replacementis substantially younger than the plaintiff is a far more reliableindicator of age discrimination than is the fact that the plaintiff wasreplaced by someone outside the protected class. The judgment of theFourth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Courtbut has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenienceof the reader.See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Detroit Lumber Co.</i>, 200 U.
