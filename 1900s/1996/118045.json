We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner and several others entered into an agreement to buy cocaine from confidential informants of the United States Customs Service. As a result, petitioner was charged with conspiring to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, see \u00a7 406, 84 Stat. 1265, as amended, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 846, a crime that carries a statutory minimum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment, see \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Plea negotiations ensued, and petitioner ultimately signed a cooperating plea agreement. The agreement provided, in pertinent part, that in return for petitioner's cooperation with the Government's investigation and his guilty plea, the Government would \"move the sentencing court, pursuant to Section 5K1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines, to depart from the otherwise applicable guideline range.\" App. 9. The agreement noted that the offense to which petitioner would plead guilty \"carries a statutory mandatory minimum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 6. The agreement did not require the Government to authorize the District Court to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum, nor did it specifically state that the Government would oppose departure below the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p>Petitioner pleaded guilty to the charged conspiracy. The probation officer determined that the Guideline sentencing range applicable to petitioner's crime was 135 to 168 months' imprisonment. In a letter to the court, the Government described the assistance rendered by petitioner and moved the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*123</span> court to impose \"a sentence lower than what the [c]ourt ha[d] determined to be the otherwise applicable <i>[sic]</i> under the sentencing guidelines.\" <i>Id.</i> , at 13-14. The letter specifically noted that \"[t]his motion is made pursuant to Section 5K1.1.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 13. The Government did not request a sentence below the statutory minimum, although, again, it did not state that the Government opposed such a departure. The District Court granted the Government's motion and departed downward from the sentencing range set by the Guidelines. However, because the Government had not also moved the District Court to depart below the statutory minimum pursuant to 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(e), the court ruled that it had no authority to so depart; it thus imposed the 10-year minimum sentence required by statute.</p>\n<p>On appeal, petitioner contended that the District Court had erred in concluding that it had no authority to depart below the statutory minimum. A \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, he argued, not only allows the court to depart downward from the sentencing level set by the Guidelines but also permits the court to depart below a lower statutory minimum. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K1.1, p. s. (Nov. 1995) (USSG). A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected that argument and affirmed the 10-year sentence. 55 F. 3d 130 (1995). A petition for rehearing was denied, with six judges dissenting.</p>\n<p>As we noted in <i>Wade</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 504 U. S. 181, 185 (1992), the Courts of Appeals disagree as to whether a Government motion attesting to the defendant's substantial assistance and requesting that the district court depart below the minimum of the applicable sentencing range under the Guidelines also permits the district court to depart below any statutory minimum.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*124</span> We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 516 U. S. 963 (1995). We now hold that such a motion does not authorize a departure below a lower statutory minimum.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The question presented involves two subsections of federal statutes and a policy statement of the Guidelines. Title 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Limited authority to impose a sentence below a statutory minimum.\u0097Upon motion of the Government, the court shall have the authority to impose a sentence below a level established by statute as minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant's substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense. Such sentence shall be imposed in accordance with the guidelines and policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994 of title 28, United States Code.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Title 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 994(n), in turn, states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The Commission shall assure that the guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a lower sentence than would otherwise be imposed, including a sentence that is lower than that established by statute as a minimum sentence, to take into account a defendant's substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, the text of \u00a7 5K1.1 of the Guidelines provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Substantial Assistance to Authorities (Policy Statement)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense, the court may depart from the guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*125</span> \"(a) The appropriate reduction shall be determined by the court for reasons stated that may include, but are not limited to, consideration of the following: [List of five factors for the court's consideration, including] the government's evaluation of the assistance rendered.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Petitioner argues that \u00a7 5K1.1 creates what he calls a \"unitary\" motion system, in which a motion attesting to the substantial assistance of the defendant and requesting a departure below the Guidelines range also permits a district court to depart below the statutory minimum.<sup>[2]</sup> The Government views \u00a7 5K1.1 as establishing a binary motion system, which permits the Government to authorize a departure below the Guidelines range while withholding from the court the authority to depart below a lower statutory minimum. The parties argue, naturally, that their respective interpretations of the system actually adopted by the Sentencing Commission were permissible ones under \u00a7 3553(e) and \u00a7 994(n).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>We believe that \u00a7 3553(e) requires a Government motion requesting or authorizing the district court to \"impose a sentence below a level established by statute as minimum <span class=\"star-pagination\">*126</span> sentence\" before the court may impose such a sentence. Petitioner and his <i>amici</i> repeatedly characterize the motion required by \u00a7 3553(e) as a \"motion that substantial assistance has occurred,\" Brief for Petitioner 12, a \"motion acknowledging the defendant's `substantial assistance,' \" <i>id.</i> , at 8, and the like. But the term \"motion\" generally means \"[a]n application made to a court or judge for purpose of obtaining a rule or order directing some act to be done in favor of the applicant.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1013 (6th ed. 1990).<sup>[4]</sup> Papers simply \"acknowledging\" substantial assistance are not sufficient if they do not indicate desire for, or consent to, a sentence below the statutory minimum.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Of course, the Government did more than simply \"acknowledge\" substantial assistance here: It moved the court to impose a sentence below the Guideline range. But we agree with the Government that nothing in \u00a7 3553(e) suggests that a district court has power to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum to reflect a defendant's cooperation when the Government has not authorized such a sentence, but has instead moved for a departure only from the applicable Guidelines range. Nor does anything in \u00a7 3553(e) or \u00a7 994(n) suggest that the Commission itself may dispense with \u00a7 3553(e)'s motion requirement or, alternatively, \"deem\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> a motion requesting or authorizing different action\u0097such as a departure below the Guidelines minimum\u0097to be a motion authorizing the district court to depart below the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we do not read \u00a7 5K1.1 as attempting to exercise this nonexistent authority. Section 5K1.1 says: \"Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance . . . the court may depart from the guidelines,\" while its Application Note 1 says: \"Under circumstances set forth in 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(e) and 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 994(n) . . . substantial assistance . . . may justify a sentence below a statutorily required minimum sentence,\" \u00a7 5K1.1, comment., n. 1. One of the circumstances set forth in \u00a7 3553(e) is, as we have explained previously, that the Government has authorized the court to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p>Petitioner and his <i>amici</i> argue that \u00a7 3553(e) requires a sentence below the statutory minimum to be imposed in \"accordance\" with the Guidelines; that \u00a7 994(n) specifically directs the Commission to draft a provision covering substantial assistance cases, including cases in which a sentence below a statutory minimum is warranted; and that if \u00a7 5K1.1 is not read as creating a unitary motion system, then the Commission has improperly failed to meet its obligation, because no other provision of the Guidelines implements \u00a7 3553(e) and \u00a7 994(n). They also argue (1) that the reference to \u00a7 3553(e) in \u00a7 5K1.1's Application Note 1 indicates that \u00a7 5K1.1 is a \"conduit\" established by the Commission for \"implementation\" of \u00a7 3553(e); (2) that Application Note 2's use of the broad term \"sentencing reduction,\" rather than \"departure from the guidelines range,\" supports petitioner's view that \u00a7 5K1.1 authorizes departures below a statutory minimum;<sup>[6]</sup> (3) that Application Note 3 makes sense only on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> the assumption that the district court retains \"full discretionary power\" over the extent of the sentencing reduction (<i>i. e.,</i> the authority to choose any sentence once the Government makes any motion confirming the defendant's substantial assistance);<sup>[7]</sup> (4) that the reference to \u00a7 5K1.1 alone (rather than to \u00a7 3553(e)) in USSG \u00a7 2D1.1's Application Note 7 further supports petitioner's claim that \u00a7 5K1.1 is a conduit for implementation of \u00a7 3553(e);<sup>[8]</sup> and (5) that if the factors described in \u00a7 5K1.1(a) limiting the district court's discretion do not apply to sentences imposed after the Government moves to depart below the statutory minimum, then the district court's discretion will be wholly unlimited in those circumstances.</p>\n<p>In the Government's view, \u00a7 3553(e) already gives the district court authority to depart below the statutory minimum on motion to do so by the prosecutor. The Government urges us to read the last sentence of \u00a7 3553(e), and the inclusion of the phrase \"including a sentence that is lower than that established by statute as a minimum sentence\" in \u00a7 994(n), as merely requiring the Commission to constrain the district court's discretion in choosing a sentence after the Government moves to depart below the statutory minimum. The Government contends that the first paragraph of \u00a7 5K1.1 does not authorize departures below the statutory minimum, but that \u00a7 5K1.1(a) does apply to sentences imposed after the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> Government moves to depart below the statutory minimum (as well as to sentences imposed after the Government moves to depart below the Guidelines range); \u00a7 5K1.1(a) thus implements the requirements of \u00a7 3553(e) and \u00a7 994(n) that relate to sentences below the statutory minimum, by requiring the district court to consider the factors listed in \u00a7\u00a7 5K1.1(a)(1)-(5) in determining the appropriate extent of a departure below the statutory minimum. According to the Government, the difficulties and gaps referred to by petitioner vanish once \u00a7 5K1.1(a) is so construed.</p>\n<p>We agree with the Government that the relevant parts of the statutes merely charge the Commission with constraining the district court's discretion in choosing a specific sentence after the Government moves for a departure below the statutory minimum.<sup>[9]</sup> Congress did not charge the Commission with \"implementing\" \u00a7 3553(e)'s Government motion requirement, beyond adopting provisions constraining the district court's discretion regarding the particular sentence selected.</p>\n<p>Although the various relevant Guidelines provisions invoked by the parties could certainly be clearer, we also believe that the Government's interpretation of the current provisions is the better one. Section 5K1.1(a) may guide the district court when it selects a sentence below the statutory minimum, as well as when it selects a sentence below the Guidelines range.<sup>[10]</sup> The Commission has not, however, improperly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> attempted to dispense with or modify the requirement for a departure below the statutory minimum spelled out in \u00a7 3553(e)\u0097that of a Government motion requesting or authorizing a departure below the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p>The Government has made no such motion here. Hence, the District Court correctly concluded that it lacked the authority to sentence petitioner to less than 10 years' imprisonment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>What is at stake in the long run is whether the Government can make a motion authorizing the district court to depart below the Guidelines range but withholding from the district court the power to depart below the statutory minimum. Although the Government contends correctly that the Commission does not have authority to \"deem\" a Government motion that does not authorize a departure below the statutory minimum to be one that does authorize such a departure, the Government apparently reads \u00a7 994(n) to permit the Commission to construct a unitary motion system <i>by adjusting the requirements for a departure below the Guidelines minimum</i> \u0097that is, by providing that the district court may depart below the Guidelines range only when the Government is willing to authorize the court to depart below the statutory minimum, if the court finds that to be appropriate. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26-31.</p>\n<p>We need not decide whether the Commission could create this second type of unitary motion system, for two reasons. First, even if the Commission had done so, that would not help petitioner, since the Government has not authorized a departure below the statutory minimum here. Second, we agree with the Government that the Commission has not adopted this type of unitary motion system. Neither the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*131</span> text of \u00a7 5K1.1 nor its commentary expressly limits the authority of the court to depart below the Guidelines minimum to situations in which the Government has moved to depart below the statutory minimum. The text of \u00a7 5K1.1 says: \"Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance .. . , the court may depart from the guidelines.\" We do not read this sentence to say: \"Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance . . . and authorizing the court to depart below the statutory minimum, if any, the court may depart from the guidelines.\" Rather, we read it as permitting the district court to depart below the Guidelines range when the Government states that the defendant has provided substantial assistance and requests or authorizes the district court to depart below the Guidelines range. As we have noted, <i>supra,</i> at 127-130, the Application Notes to \u00a7 5K1.1 and \u00a7 2D1.1 do not compel any other reading.</p>\n<p>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i> </p>\n<p>Justice Souter, concurring.</p>\n<p>I agree with the conclusion that 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(e) requires a motion by the Government asking the district court to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum, but I part company with the Court on the characterization of the policy statement numbered \u00a7 5K1.1, United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K1.1, p. s. (Nov. 1995) (USSG). The text of this policy statement deals with departures from the Guidelines; the best reading of each sentence is that its referent is a Guideline departure, and that neither directly applies to reductions below mandatory minimums. The Application Notes (which are \"the legal equivalent of a policy statement,\" USSG \u00a7 1B1.7) are where the Sentencing Commission has dealt with sentences below statutory minimums. In my view, the Sentencing Commission has discharged its responsibility under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 994(n) by its <span class=\"star-pagination\">*132</span> inclusion of the Application Notes, which effectively tell district courts that the policy statement applies as well to motions for reductions below mandatory minimums. Thus, my disagreement is over the suggestion that the two sentences of \u00a7 5K1.1 can be treated separately. I would simply say that the Application Notes indicate that \u00a7 5K1.1 applies to motions under \u00a7 3553(e), and leave it at that.</p>\n<p>Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>Petitioner has persuaded me that the Sentencing Commission intended \u00a7 5K1.1 to create a unitary motion system under which any request for a departure below the Guideline range based on substantial assistance would also authorize a departure below the statutory minimum. Such a system would be eminently reasonable, but, for two reasons, I am convinced that Congress did not intend to authorize it. First, I agree with the Court that the text of \u00a7 3553(e) does not authorize the court to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum unless the Government has made a motion requesting that relief. Second, notwithstanding my serious doubts concerning the wisdom of a congressional decision to impose statutory minimum sentences higher than those considered appropriate by the Commission, the very fact that Congress has done so indicates that it intended to confer the authority to dispense with the statutory minima on the prosecutor rather than the Commission.</p>\n<p>Thus, I concur in the judgment because I agree with the Court's interpretation of \u00a7 3553(e).</p>\n<p>Justice Breyer, with whom Justice O'Connor joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion, for, like the Court, I believe the Commission does not have the power to modify Congress' statutes. I disagree with Part III, however, because the Commission does have the power to write its own Guidelines and, in my view, the Commission has in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*133</span> fact exercised that power to create what the Court calls a \"unitary motion system.\"</p>\n<p>To understand that system, one must keep in mind two facts. First, many \"substantial assistance\" departures involve departures only from Guideline sentences, not from statutory mandatory minimum sentences. When a defendant seeks a \"substantial assistance\" departure from the minimum Guideline sentence for robbery, fraud, money laundering, tax evasion, or most other offenses, the defendant need not worry about a statutorily required minimum sentence, for either no such minimum sentence applies, or that sentence is so far below the minimum Guideline sentence that there is no practical likelihood of a departure drastic enough to make it relevant. The Guidelines govern departures from these Guideline sentences, and they permit judges to depart downward for \"substantial assistance\" only if the Government makes a \"motion . . . stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\" United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K1.1, p. s. (Nov. 1995) (USSG). I call the policy statement that sets forth this rule the \"Substantial Assistance Guideline.\"</p>\n<p>Second, some criminal convictions implicate not only the Guidelines, but also the special statutes (applicable particularly to drug and weapon offenses) that set \"mandatory minimum\" sentences. See United States Sentencing Commission, Mandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System, App. A, pp. A1-A8 (Aug. 1991) (Mandatory Minimum Penalties). The law does not normally permit a departure below such mandatory statutory minimums. But cf. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(f) (limitation on applicability of statutory minimums in certain cases); USSG \u00a7 5C1.2 (same). The law does permit such a departure, however, for one special reason, namely, \"substantial assistance,\" but only if the Government makes a \"motion . . . so as to reflect a defendant's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*134</span> substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\" 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(e). I shall call the statute that states this rule the \"Substantial Assistance Statute.\"</p>\n<p>With these two basic facts in mind, one might ask what the Commission means by the term \"substantial assistance\" in its Substantial Assistance Guideline. In particular, do those words in that Guideline mean the same thing that those same words mean in the Substantial Assistance Statute? Or does the Commission intend those words in its Guideline to create a tougher, or perhaps a more lenient, standard where departures from Guideline minimums (rather than departures from statutory minimums) are at issue?</p>\n<p>The answer to this interpretive question, in my view, is that the Commission means the term \"substantial assistance\" in its Substantial Assistance Guideline to create the same standard that the Substantial Assistance Statute creates using the same words. As so interpreted, the Guideline authorizes a sentencing judge to depart downward from a Guideline sentence for substantial assistance only if the Government files the same kind of motion that the Government would file to obtain a departure from a statutory minimum sentence, were such a sentence at issue.</p>\n<p>My reasons for believing that the Commission intended to tie its Substantial Assistance Guideline to the Substantial Assistance Statute (thereby recognizing one kind of \"substantial assistance,\" not two) are the following: First, as I have said, the language the Commission used to write its Substantial Assistance Guideline is virtually identical to the language that appears in the Substantial Assistance Statute. Compare USSG \u00a7 5K1.1, p. s., with 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(e). Second, the Commission nowhere suggests that the key words \"substantial assistance\" mean something different in the two places (the Guideline and the Statute) where they appear, and I cannot imagine any reason why the Commission would <span class=\"star-pagination\">*135</span> have wanted to create different standards through the use of identical words, thereby creating additional administrative complexity and risking unnecessary confusion. Third, the Commission's commentary refers to statutory and guideline departures indiscriminately. USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, comment., n. 7 (citing Substantial Assistance Guideline for proposition that statutory minimum may be \"waived\"); see also Mandatory Minimum Penalties, <i>supra,</i> at 59 (discussing unitary \"substantial assistance motions\").</p>\n<p>The Court's reason for reaching the contrary conclusion is that the Commission did not specify that courts could not depart below a minimum Guideline sentence without a Government motion for departure below any applicable statutory minimum. That is, the Substantial Assistance Guideline does not say: \"Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance . . . <i>and authorizing the court to depart below the statutory minimum, if any,</i> the court may depart from the guidelines.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 131 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). But it is not surprising that the Commission neglected to add these words of crystal clarity to the Substantial Assistance Guideline, since that Guideline governs many cases that have nothing to do with mandatory minimum sentences. It makes sense, instead, for the Commission to have noted the interplay of \"substantial assistance\" and statutory minimums in its commentary to the Substantial Assistance Guideline, see USSG \u00a7 5K1.1, p. s., comment., n. 1, and in its section on drug offenses, for which statutory minimums are relatively common, see <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 2D1.1, comment., n. 7.</p>\n<p>I recognize that the Court, through its interpretation of the Guideline, avoids having to decide \"whether the Commission could create this . . . unitary motion system.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 130. But the legal question it avoids is not a difficult one. Congress delegated to the Commission broad authority to determine when sentencing courts may reward substantial assistance with a reduced sentence. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 994(n). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*136</span> The Commission's exercise of delegated authority is normally lawful as long as it is reasonable. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>Shabazz,</i> 933 F. 2d 1029, 1035 (CADC) (Thomas, J.) (citing <i>Chevron U. S. A. Inc.</i> v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U. S. 837, 842-845 (1984)), cert. denied <i>sub nom. </i><i>McNeil</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 502 U. S. 964 (1991). And a unitary system seems perfectly reasonable. Indeed, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure recognize an identical \"unitary\" system for post judgment substantial assistance motions. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 35(b) (\"[O]n motion of the Government made within one year after the imposition of the sentence,\" court may reduce sentence \"to reflect a defendant's subsequent, substantial assistance\"; this may include reduction \"to a level below that established by statute as a minimum sentence\"). Thus in my view, the Commission had the power to create a \"unitary motion system,\" and is free to maintain such a system, or to change it, in light of evolving criminal justice policies.</p>\n<p>In this case, the lower courts accepted the Government's \"departure\" motion as sufficient to justify a departure below the 135-month Guideline minimum applicable to petitioner's crime, but not sufficient to justify a departure below the applicable 10-year statutory minimum. On a \"unitary\" view, this disposition could not be correct. Either the motion was sufficient to warrant a departure below the statutory minimum, or it was insufficient to warrant a departure below the Guideline minimum. I would remand this case to the lower courts for further consideration of this case-specific issue.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, while agreeing with much of what the Court has written, I dissent from its disposition.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   <i>Alan I.

We do not view this issue as included within the question upon which we granted certiorari, see Pet. for Cert. 3 (\"Did the sentencing court have the discretion to depart below the applicable statutory minimum once the United States moved for departure under USSG \u00a7 5K1, without the requirement of a second government departure application under 18 U. S. C. 3553(e)?\"), and petitioner appears to concede that it is not, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 15. We therefore decline to address the argument.</p>\n<p>[3]  Although it is plain that under \u00a7 994(n), the Commission was at least authorized to create a system in which <i>no</i> Government motion of any kind need be filed before the district court may depart below the Guidelines minimum, neither party argues that the Commission has created such a system.</p>\n<p>[4]  See also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1254 (2d ed. 1987) (defining \"motion\" in the legal sense as \"an application made to a court or judge for an order, ruling, or the like\"); <i>Wade</i> v. <i>United States,</i>  504 U. S. 181, 187 (1992) (\"[Substantial assistance] is a necessary condition for [a departure, but] it is not a sufficient one. The Government's decision not to move may have been based not on a failure to acknowledge or appreciate [the defendant's] help, but simply on its rational assessment of the cost and benefit that would flow from moving\").</p>\n<p>[5]  We do not mean to imply, of course, that specific language (such as that quoted in text) or, on the other hand, an express reference to \u00a7 3553(e) is necessarily required before a court may depart below the statutory minimum. Cf. Brief for Petitioner 5-6, 18, 32, 34 (characterizing the opposing argument in this fashion). But the Government must in some way indicate its desire or consent that the court depart below the statutory minimum before the court may do so.</p>\n<p>[6]  Application Note 2 provides in relevant part: \"The sentencing reduction for assistance to authorities shall be considered independently of any reduction for acceptance of responsibility.\" USSG \u00a7 5K1.1, comment., n. 2.</p>\n<p>[7]  Application Note 3 provides: \"Substantial weight should be given to the government's evaluation of the extent of the defendant's assistance, particularly where the extent and value of the assistance are difficult to ascertain.\" USSG \u00a7 5K1.1, comment., n. 3.</p>\n<p>[8]  Application Note 7 provides in pertinent part: \"Where a mandatory (statutory) minimum sentence applies, this mandatory minimum sentence may be `waived' and a lower sentence imposed (including a sentence below the applicable guideline range), as provided in 28 U.

See \u00a7 5K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to Authorities).\" USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, comment., n. 7. Section 2D1.1 is a Guideline addressed to a variety of drug offenses.</p>\n<p>[9]  Notably, \u00a7 3553(e) states that the \"sentence\" shall be imposed in accordance with the Guidelines and policy statements, not that the \"departure\" shall occur, or shall be authorized, in accordance with the Guidelines and policy statements.</p>\n<p>[10]  Section \u00a7 5K1.1(a) may apply of its own force to sentences below the statutory minimum, see <i>ibid.</i> (providing that the district court shall determine \"[t]he appropriate reduction\" by applying a nonexhaustive list of factors), and both the reference to \u00a7 3553(e) in \u00a7 5K1.1's Application Note 1 and the reference to \u00a7 5K1.1 in \u00a7 2D1.1's Application Note 7 may reflect that fact. Or perhaps the phrase \"[t]he appropriate reduction\" in \u00a7 5K1.1(a) encompasses only departures below the Guidelines range, but the Application Notes are meant to suggest that the court should also consider the \u00a7 5K1.1(a) factors in the analogous circumstance of a departure below the statutory minimum.</p>\n\n</div>",

We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner and several others entered into an agreement to buy cocaine from confidential informants of the United States Customs Service. As a result, petitioner was charged with conspiring to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, see \u00a7 406, 84 Stat. 1265, as amended, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 846, a crime that carries a statutory minimum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment, see \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Plea negotiations ensued, and petitioner ultimately signed a cooperating plea agreement. The agreement provided, in pertinent part, that in return for petitioner's cooperation with the Government's investigation and his guilty plea, the Government would \"move the sentencing court, pursuant to Section 5K1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines, to depart from the otherwise applicable guideline range.\" App. 9. The agreement noted that the offense to which petitioner would plead guilty \"carries a statutory mandatory minimum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 6. The agreement did not require the Government to authorize the District Court to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum, nor did it specifically state that the Government would oppose departure below the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p>Petitioner pleaded guilty to the charged conspiracy. The probation officer determined that the Guideline sentencing range applicable to petitioner's crime was 135 to 168 months' imprisonment. In a letter to the court, the Government described the assistance rendered by petitioner and moved the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*123</span> court to impose \"a sentence lower than what the [c]ourt ha[d] determined to be the otherwise applicable <i>[sic]</i> under the sentencing guidelines.\" <i>Id.</i> , at 13-14. The letter specifically noted that \"[t]his motion is made pursuant to Section 5K1.1.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 13. The Government did not request a sentence below the statutory minimum, although, again, it did not state that the Government opposed such a departure. The District Court granted the Government's motion and departed downward from the sentencing range set by the Guidelines. However, because the Government had not also moved the District Court to depart below the statutory minimum pursuant to 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(e), the court ruled that it had no authority to so depart; it thus imposed the 10-year minimum sentence required by statute.</p>\n<p>On appeal, petitioner contended that the District Court had erred in concluding that it had no authority to depart below the statutory minimum. A \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, he argued, not only allows the court to depart downward from the sentencing level set by the Guidelines but also permits the court to depart below a lower statutory minimum. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K1.1, p. s. (Nov. 1995) (USSG). A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected that argument and affirmed the 10-year sentence. 55 F. 3d 130 (1995). A petition for rehearing was denied, with six judges dissenting.</p>\n<p>As we noted in <i>Wade</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 504 U. S. 181, 185 (1992), the Courts of Appeals disagree as to whether a Government motion attesting to the defendant's substantial assistance and requesting that the district court depart below the minimum of the applicable sentencing range under the Guidelines also permits the district court to depart below any statutory minimum.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*124</span> We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 516 U. S. 963 (1995). We now hold that such a motion does not authorize a departure below a lower statutory minimum.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The question presented involves two subsections of federal statutes and a policy statement of the Guidelines. Title 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Limited authority to impose a sentence below a statutory minimum.\u0097Upon motion of the Government, the court shall have the authority to impose a sentence below a level established by statute as minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant's substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense. Such sentence shall be imposed in accordance with the guidelines and policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994 of title 28, United States Code.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Title 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 994(n), in turn, states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The Commission shall assure that the guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a lower sentence than would otherwise be imposed, including a sentence that is lower than that established by statute as a minimum sentence, to take into account a defendant's substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, the text of \u00a7 5K1.1 of the Guidelines provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Substantial Assistance to Authorities (Policy Statement)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense, the court may depart from the guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*125</span> \"(a) The appropriate reduction shall be determined by the court for reasons stated that may include, but are not limited to, consideration of the following: [List of five factors for the court's consideration, including] the government's evaluation of the assistance rendered.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Petitioner argues that \u00a7 5K1.1 creates what he calls a \"unitary\" motion system, in which a motion attesting to the substantial assistance of the defendant and requesting a departure below the Guidelines range also permits a district court to depart below the statutory minimum.<sup>[2]</sup> The Government views \u00a7 5K1.1 as establishing a binary motion system, which permits the Government to authorize a departure below the Guidelines range while withholding from the court the authority to depart below a lower statutory minimum. The parties argue, naturally, that their respective interpretations of the system actually adopted by the Sentencing Commission were permissible ones under \u00a7 3553(e) and \u00a7 994(n).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>We believe that \u00a7 3553(e) requires a Government motion requesting or authorizing the district court to \"impose a sentence below a level established by statute as minimum <span class=\"star-pagination\">*126</span> sentence\" before the court may impose such a sentence. Petitioner and his <i>amici</i> repeatedly characterize the motion required by \u00a7 3553(e) as a \"motion that substantial assistance has occurred,\" Brief for Petitioner 12, a \"motion acknowledging the defendant's `substantial assistance,' \" <i>id.</i> , at 8, and the like. But the term \"motion\" generally means \"[a]n application made to a court or judge for purpose of obtaining a rule or order directing some act to be done in favor of the applicant.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1013 (6th ed. 1990).<sup>[4]</sup> Papers simply \"acknowledging\" substantial assistance are not sufficient if they do not indicate desire for, or consent to, a sentence below the statutory minimum.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Of course, the Government did more than simply \"acknowledge\" substantial assistance here: It moved the court to impose a sentence below the Guideline range. But we agree with the Government that nothing in \u00a7 3553(e) suggests that a district court has power to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum to reflect a defendant's cooperation when the Government has not authorized such a sentence, but has instead moved for a departure only from the applicable Guidelines range. Nor does anything in \u00a7 3553(e) or \u00a7 994(n) suggest that the Commission itself may dispense with \u00a7 3553(e)'s motion requirement or, alternatively, \"deem\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> a motion requesting or authorizing different action\u0097such as a departure below the Guidelines minimum\u0097to be a motion authorizing the district court to depart below the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we do not read \u00a7 5K1.1 as attempting to exercise this nonexistent authority. Section 5K1.1 says: \"Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance . . . the court may depart from the guidelines,\" while its Application Note 1 says: \"Under circumstances set forth in 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(e) and 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 994(n) . . . substantial assistance . . . may justify a sentence below a statutorily required minimum sentence,\" \u00a7 5K1.1, comment., n. 1. One of the circumstances set forth in \u00a7 3553(e) is, as we have explained previously, that the Government has authorized the court to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p>Petitioner and his <i>amici</i> argue that \u00a7 3553(e) requires a sentence below the statutory minimum to be imposed in \"accordance\" with the Guidelines; that \u00a7 994(n) specifically directs the Commission to draft a provision covering substantial assistance cases, including cases in which a sentence below a statutory minimum is warranted; and that if \u00a7 5K1.1 is not read as creating a unitary motion system, then the Commission has improperly failed to meet its obligation, because no other provision of the Guidelines implements \u00a7 3553(e) and \u00a7 994(n). They also argue (1) that the reference to \u00a7 3553(e) in \u00a7 5K1.1's Application Note 1 indicates that \u00a7 5K1.1 is a \"conduit\" established by the Commission for \"implementation\" of \u00a7 3553(e); (2) that Application Note 2's use of the broad term \"sentencing reduction,\" rather than \"departure from the guidelines range,\" supports petitioner's view that \u00a7 5K1.1 authorizes departures below a statutory minimum;<sup>[6]</sup> (3) that Application Note 3 makes sense only on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> the assumption that the district court retains \"full discretionary power\" over the extent of the sentencing reduction (<i>i. e.,</i> the authority to choose any sentence once the Government makes any motion confirming the defendant's substantial assistance);<sup>[7]</sup> (4) that the reference to \u00a7 5K1.1 alone (rather than to \u00a7 3553(e)) in USSG \u00a7 2D1.1's Application Note 7 further supports petitioner's claim that \u00a7 5K1.1 is a conduit for implementation of \u00a7 3553(e);<sup>[8]</sup> and (5) that if the factors described in \u00a7 5K1.1(a) limiting the district court's discretion do not apply to sentences imposed after the Government moves to depart below the statutory minimum, then the district court's discretion will be wholly unlimited in those circumstances.</p>\n<p>In the Government's view, \u00a7 3553(e) already gives the district court authority to depart below the statutory minimum on motion to do so by the prosecutor. The Government urges us to read the last sentence of \u00a7 3553(e), and the inclusion of the phrase \"including a sentence that is lower than that established by statute as a minimum sentence\" in \u00a7 994(n), as merely requiring the Commission to constrain the district court's discretion in choosing a sentence after the Government moves to depart below the statutory minimum. The Government contends that the first paragraph of \u00a7 5K1.1 does not authorize departures below the statutory minimum, but that \u00a7 5K1.1(a) does apply to sentences imposed after the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> Government moves to depart below the statutory minimum (as well as to sentences imposed after the Government moves to depart below the Guidelines range); \u00a7 5K1.1(a) thus implements the requirements of \u00a7 3553(e) and \u00a7 994(n) that relate to sentences below the statutory minimum, by requiring the district court to consider the factors listed in \u00a7\u00a7 5K1.1(a)(1)-(5) in determining the appropriate extent of a departure below the statutory minimum. According to the Government, the difficulties and gaps referred to by petitioner vanish once \u00a7 5K1.1(a) is so construed.</p>\n<p>We agree with the Government that the relevant parts of the statutes merely charge the Commission with constraining the district court's discretion in choosing a specific sentence after the Government moves for a departure below the statutory minimum.<sup>[9]</sup> Congress did not charge the Commission with \"implementing\" \u00a7 3553(e)'s Government motion requirement, beyond adopting provisions constraining the district court's discretion regarding the particular sentence selected.</p>\n<p>Although the various relevant Guidelines provisions invoked by the parties could certainly be clearer, we also believe that the Government's interpretation of the current provisions is the better one. Section 5K1.1(a) may guide the district court when it selects a sentence below the statutory minimum, as well as when it selects a sentence below the Guidelines range.<sup>[10]</sup> The Commission has not, however, improperly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> attempted to dispense with or modify the requirement for a departure below the statutory minimum spelled out in \u00a7 3553(e)\u0097that of a Government motion requesting or authorizing a departure below the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p>The Government has made no such motion here. Hence, the District Court correctly concluded that it lacked the authority to sentence petitioner to less than 10 years' imprisonment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>What is at stake in the long run is whether the Government can make a motion authorizing the district court to depart below the Guidelines range but withholding from the district court the power to depart below the statutory minimum. Although the Government contends correctly that the Commission does not have authority to \"deem\" a Government motion that does not authorize a departure below the statutory minimum to be one that does authorize such a departure, the Government apparently reads \u00a7 994(n) to permit the Commission to construct a unitary motion system <i>by adjusting the requirements for a departure below the Guidelines minimum</i> \u0097that is, by providing that the district court may depart below the Guidelines range only when the Government is willing to authorize the court to depart below the statutory minimum, if the court finds that to be appropriate. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26-31.</p>\n<p>We need not decide whether the Commission could create this second type of unitary motion system, for two reasons. First, even if the Commission had done so, that would not help petitioner, since the Government has not authorized a departure below the statutory minimum here. Second, we agree with the Government that the Commission has not adopted this type of unitary motion system. Neither the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*131</span> text of \u00a7 5K1.1 nor its commentary expressly limits the authority of the court to depart below the Guidelines minimum to situations in which the Government has moved to depart below the statutory minimum. The text of \u00a7 5K1.1 says: \"Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance .. . , the court may depart from the guidelines.\" We do not read this sentence to say: \"Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance . . . and authorizing the court to depart below the statutory minimum, if any, the court may depart from the guidelines.\" Rather, we read it as permitting the district court to depart below the Guidelines range when the Government states that the defendant has provided substantial assistance and requests or authorizes the district court to depart below the Guidelines range. As we have noted, <i>supra,</i> at 127-130, the Application Notes to \u00a7 5K1.1 and \u00a7 2D1.1 do not compel any other reading.</p>\n<p>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i> </p>\n<p>Justice Souter, concurring.</p>\n<p>I agree with the conclusion that 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(e) requires a motion by the Government asking the district court to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum, but I part company with the Court on the characterization of the policy statement numbered \u00a7 5K1.1, United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K1.1, p. s. (Nov. 1995) (USSG). The text of this policy statement deals with departures from the Guidelines; the best reading of each sentence is that its referent is a Guideline departure, and that neither directly applies to reductions below mandatory minimums. The Application Notes (which are \"the legal equivalent of a policy statement,\" USSG \u00a7 1B1.7) are where the Sentencing Commission has dealt with sentences below statutory minimums. In my view, the Sentencing Commission has discharged its responsibility under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 994(n) by its <span class=\"star-pagination\">*132</span> inclusion of the Application Notes, which effectively tell district courts that the policy statement applies as well to motions for reductions below mandatory minimums. Thus, my disagreement is over the suggestion that the two sentences of \u00a7 5K1.1 can be treated separately. I would simply say that the Application Notes indicate that \u00a7 5K1.1 applies to motions under \u00a7 3553(e), and leave it at that.</p>\n<p>Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>Petitioner has persuaded me that the Sentencing Commission intended \u00a7 5K1.1 to create a unitary motion system under which any request for a departure below the Guideline range based on substantial assistance would also authorize a departure below the statutory minimum. Such a system would be eminently reasonable, but, for two reasons, I am convinced that Congress did not intend to authorize it. First, I agree with the Court that the text of \u00a7 3553(e) does not authorize the court to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum unless the Government has made a motion requesting that relief. Second, notwithstanding my serious doubts concerning the wisdom of a congressional decision to impose statutory minimum sentences higher than those considered appropriate by the Commission, the very fact that Congress has done so indicates that it intended to confer the authority to dispense with the statutory minima on the prosecutor rather than the Commission.</p>\n<p>Thus, I concur in the judgment because I agree with the Court's interpretation of \u00a7 3553(e).</p>\n<p>Justice Breyer, with whom Justice O'Connor joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion, for, like the Court, I believe the Commission does not have the power to modify Congress' statutes. I disagree with Part III, however, because the Commission does have the power to write its own Guidelines and, in my view, the Commission has in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*133</span> fact exercised that power to create what the Court calls a \"unitary motion system.\"</p>\n<p>To understand that system, one must keep in mind two facts. First, many \"substantial assistance\" departures involve departures only from Guideline sentences, not from statutory mandatory minimum sentences. When a defendant seeks a \"substantial assistance\" departure from the minimum Guideline sentence for robbery, fraud, money laundering, tax evasion, or most other offenses, the defendant need not worry about a statutorily required minimum sentence, for either no such minimum sentence applies, or that sentence is so far below the minimum Guideline sentence that there is no practical likelihood of a departure drastic enough to make it relevant. The Guidelines govern departures from these Guideline sentences, and they permit judges to depart downward for \"substantial assistance\" only if the Government makes a \"motion . . . stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\" United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K1.1, p. s. (Nov. 1995) (USSG). I call the policy statement that sets forth this rule the \"Substantial Assistance Guideline.\"</p>\n<p>Second, some criminal convictions implicate not only the Guidelines, but also the special statutes (applicable particularly to drug and weapon offenses) that set \"mandatory minimum\" sentences. See United States Sentencing Commission, Mandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System, App. A, pp. A1-A8 (Aug. 1991) (Mandatory Minimum Penalties). The law does not normally permit a departure below such mandatory statutory minimums. But cf. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(f) (limitation on applicability of statutory minimums in certain cases); USSG \u00a7 5C1.2 (same). The law does permit such a departure, however, for one special reason, namely, \"substantial assistance,\" but only if the Government makes a \"motion . . . so as to reflect a defendant's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*134</span> substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\" 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(e). I shall call the statute that states this rule the \"Substantial Assistance Statute.\"</p>\n<p>With these two basic facts in mind, one might ask what the Commission means by the term \"substantial assistance\" in its Substantial Assistance Guideline. In particular, do those words in that Guideline mean the same thing that those same words mean in the Substantial Assistance Statute? Or does the Commission intend those words in its Guideline to create a tougher, or perhaps a more lenient, standard where departures from Guideline minimums (rather than departures from statutory minimums) are at issue?</p>\n<p>The answer to this interpretive question, in my view, is that the Commission means the term \"substantial assistance\" in its Substantial Assistance Guideline to create the same standard that the Substantial Assistance Statute creates using the same words. As so interpreted, the Guideline authorizes a sentencing judge to depart downward from a Guideline sentence for substantial assistance only if the Government files the same kind of motion that the Government would file to obtain a departure from a statutory minimum sentence, were such a sentence at issue.</p>\n<p>My reasons for believing that the Commission intended to tie its Substantial Assistance Guideline to the Substantial Assistance Statute (thereby recognizing one kind of \"substantial assistance,\" not two) are the following: First, as I have said, the language the Commission used to write its Substantial Assistance Guideline is virtually identical to the language that appears in the Substantial Assistance Statute. Compare USSG \u00a7 5K1.1, p. s., with 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(e). Second, the Commission nowhere suggests that the key words \"substantial assistance\" mean something different in the two places (the Guideline and the Statute) where they appear, and I cannot imagine any reason why the Commission would <span class=\"star-pagination\">*135</span> have wanted to create different standards through the use of identical words, thereby creating additional administrative complexity and risking unnecessary confusion. Third, the Commission's commentary refers to statutory and guideline departures indiscriminately. USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, comment., n. 7 (citing Substantial Assistance Guideline for proposition that statutory minimum may be \"waived\"); see also Mandatory Minimum Penalties, <i>supra,</i> at 59 (discussing unitary \"substantial assistance motions\").</p>\n<p>The Court's reason for reaching the contrary conclusion is that the Commission did not specify that courts could not depart below a minimum Guideline sentence without a Government motion for departure below any applicable statutory minimum. That is, the Substantial Assistance Guideline does not say: \"Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance . . . <i>and authorizing the court to depart below the statutory minimum, if any,</i> the court may depart from the guidelines.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 131 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). But it is not surprising that the Commission neglected to add these words of crystal clarity to the Substantial Assistance Guideline, since that Guideline governs many cases that have nothing to do with mandatory minimum sentences. It makes sense, instead, for the Commission to have noted the interplay of \"substantial assistance\" and statutory minimums in its commentary to the Substantial Assistance Guideline, see USSG \u00a7 5K1.1, p. s., comment., n. 1, and in its section on drug offenses, for which statutory minimums are relatively common, see <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 2D1.1, comment., n. 7.</p>\n<p>I recognize that the Court, through its interpretation of the Guideline, avoids having to decide \"whether the Commission could create this . . . unitary motion system.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 130. But the legal question it avoids is not a difficult one. Congress delegated to the Commission broad authority to determine when sentencing courts may reward substantial assistance with a reduced sentence. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 994(n). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*136</span> The Commission's exercise of delegated authority is normally lawful as long as it is reasonable. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>Shabazz,</i> 933 F. 2d 1029, 1035 (CADC) (Thomas, J.) (citing <i>Chevron U. S. A. Inc.</i> v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U. S. 837, 842-845 (1984)), cert. denied <i>sub nom. </i><i>McNeil</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 502 U. S. 964 (1991). And a unitary system seems perfectly reasonable. Indeed, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure recognize an identical \"unitary\" system for post judgment substantial assistance motions. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 35(b) (\"[O]n motion of the Government made within one year after the imposition of the sentence,\" court may reduce sentence \"to reflect a defendant's subsequent, substantial assistance\"; this may include reduction \"to a level below that established by statute as a minimum sentence\"). Thus in my view, the Commission had the power to create a \"unitary motion system,\" and is free to maintain such a system, or to change it, in light of evolving criminal justice policies.</p>\n<p>In this case, the lower courts accepted the Government's \"departure\" motion as sufficient to justify a departure below the 135-month Guideline minimum applicable to petitioner's crime, but not sufficient to justify a departure below the applicable 10-year statutory minimum. On a \"unitary\" view, this disposition could not be correct. Either the motion was sufficient to warrant a departure below the statutory minimum, or it was insufficient to warrant a departure below the Guideline minimum. I would remand this case to the lower courts for further consideration of this case-specific issue.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, while agreeing with much of what the Court has written, I dissent from its disposition.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   <i>Alan I.

See Reply Brief for Petitioner 7-8. We do not view this issue as included within the question upon which we granted certiorari, see Pet. for Cert. 3 (\"Did the sentencing court have the discretion to depart below the applicable statutory minimum once the United States moved for departure under USSG \u00a7 5K1, without the requirement of a second government departure application under 18 U.

We therefore decline to address the argument.</p>\n<p>[3]  Although it is plain that under \u00a7 994(n), the Commission was at least authorized to create a system in which <i>no</i> Government motion of any kind need be filed before the district court may depart below the Guidelines minimum, neither party argues that the Commission has created such a system.</p>\n<p>[4]  See also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1254 (2d ed. 1987) (defining \"motion\" in the legal sense as \"an application made to a court or judge for an order, ruling, or the like\"); <i>Wade</i> v. <i>United States,</i>  504 U.

S. C. Section(s) 846, which carries a  statutory minimum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment.  He ultimately  signed a plea agreement providing, <i>inter alia</i>, that in return for his  cooperation with the Government's investigation and his guilty plea, the  Government would move the sentencing court, pursuant to Section(s) 5K1.1  of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, to depart downward from the  otherwise applicable Guideline sentencing range, which turned out to be  135-to-168 months' imprisonment.  Although the agreement noted the  applicability of the 10-year statutory minimum sentence, neither it nor  the ensuing Section(s) 5K1.1 motion mentioned departure below that  minimum. Pursuant to the motion, the District Court departed downward  from the Guideline range in sentencing petitioner.  It also ruled,  however, that it had no authority to depart below the statutory minimum  because the Government had not made a motion, pursuant 18 U. S. C. Section(s) 3553(e), that it do so.  It thus sentenced petitioner to 10  years, and the Third Circuit affirmed.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Held</i>:  A Government motion attesting to the defendant's substantial  assistance in a criminal investigation and requesting that the district  court depart below the minimum of the applicable Guideline sentencing  range does not also authorize the court to depart below a lower  statutory minimum sentence.  Pp. 3-11.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Guideline Section(s) 5K1.1 does not create a \"unitary\" motion  system.  Title 18 U. S. C. Section(s) 3553(e) requires a Government  motion requesting or authorizing the district court to \"impose a  sentence below a level established by statute as minimum sentence\"  before the court may impose such a sentence. Nothing in Section(s)  3553(e) suggests that a district court has the power to impose such a  sentence when the Government has not authorized it, but has instead  moved for a departure only from the applicable Guidelines range.  Nor  does anything in Section(s) 3553(e) or 28 U. S. C. Section(s) 994(n)  suggest that the Commission itself may dispense with Section(s)  3553(e)'s motion requirement, or alternatively, \"deem\" a motion  requesting or authorizing different action - such as a departure below  the Guidelines minimum - to be a motion authorizing departure below the  statutory minimum.  Section 5K1.1 cannot be read as attempting to  exercise this nonexistent authority.  That section states that, \"[u]pon  motion of the government . . . the court may depart from the  guidelines,\" while its Application Note 1 declares that, \"[u]nder  circumstances set forth in . . . Section(s) 3553(e) and . . . Section(s)  994(n) . . . substantial assistance . . . may justify a sentence below a  statutorily required minimum sentence.\"  One of the circumstances set  forth in Section(s) 3553(e) is that the Government has authorized the court to impose such a sentence.  The Government is correct that the  relevant statutory provisions merely charge the Commission with  constraining the district court's discretion in choosing a specific  sentence once the Government has moved for a departure below the  statutory minimum, not with \"implementing\" Section(s) 3553(e)'s motion  requirement, and that Section(s) 5K1.1 does not improperly attempt to  dispense with or modify that requirement. Pp. 3-10.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) For two reasons, the Court need not decide whether the Government is  correct in reading Section(s) 994(n) to permit the Commission to  construct a unitary motion system by providing that the district court  may depart below the Guidelines range only when the Government is  willing to authorize the court to depart below the statutory minimum, if  the court finds that to be appropriate.  First, even if the Commission  had done so, that would not help petitioner, since the Government has  not authorized a departure below the statutory minimum here.  Second, the Commission has not adopted this type of unitary system.

As a result, petitioner was charged with conspiring to  distribute and to possess with intent to distribute more than five  kilograms of cocaine, see Section(s) 406, 84 Stat. 1265, as amended, 21  U. S. C. Section(s) 846, a crime that carries a statutory minimum  sentence of 10 years' imprisonment, see Section(s) 841(b)(1)(A).  Plea  negotiations ensued, and petitioner ultimately signed a cooperating plea  agreement.  The agreement provided, in pertinent part, that in return  for petitioner's cooperation with the Government's investigation and his  guilty plea, the Government would \"move the sentencing court, pursuant  to Section 5K1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines, to depart from the  otherwise applicable guideline range.\" App. 9.  The agreement noted that  the offense  to which petitioner would plead guilty \"carries a statutory  mandatory minimum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 6.  The  agreement did not require the Government to authorize the District Court  to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum, nor did it  specifically state that the Government would oppose departure below the statutory minimum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner pleaded guilty to the charged conspiracy.  The probation officer determined that the Guideline sentencing range applicable to petitioner's crime was 135 to 168 months' imprisonment.  In a letter to the court, the Government described the assistance  rendered by petitioner and moved the court to impose \"a sentence lower  than what the [c]ourt ha[d] determined to be the otherwise applicable   [sic] under the sentencing guidelines.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 13-14.  The letter  specifically noted that \"[t]his motion is made pursuant to Section  5K1.1.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 13. The Government did not request a sentence below the  statutory minimum, although, again, it did not state that the Government opposed such a departure.  The District Court granted the Government's  motion and departed downward from the sentencing range set by the  Guidelines. However, because the Government had not also moved the  District Court to depart below the statutory minimum pursuant to 18 U.  S. C. Section(s) 3553(e), the court ruled that it had no authority to so  depart; it thus imposed the 10-year minimum sentence required by  statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, petitioner contended that the District Court had erred in concluding that it had no authority to depart below the statutory minimum.  A Section(s) 5K1.1 motion, he argued, not only allows the court to depart downward from the sentencing level set by the  Guidelines but also permits the court to depart below a lower statutory  minimum.  See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual  Section(s) 5K1.1, p. s. (Nov. 1995) (USSG).  A divided panel of the  Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected that argument and  affirmed the 10-year sentence. 55 F. 3d 130 (1995).

The  parties argue, naturally, that their respective interpretations of the  system actually adopted by the Sentencing Commission were permissible ones under Section(s) 3553(e) and Section(s) 994(n).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that Section(s) 3553(e) requires a Government motion  requesting or authorizing the district court to \"impose a sentence below  a level established by statute as minimum sentence\" before the court may  impose such a sentence. Petitioner and his <i>amici</i> repeatedly  characterize the motion required by Section(s) 3553(e) as a \"motion that  substantial assistance has occurred,\" Brief for Petitioner 12, a \"motion acknowledging the defendant's `substantial assistance,' \" <i>id.,</i> at 8, and  the like.  But the term \"motion\" generally means \"[a]n application made  to a court or judge for purpose of obtaining a rule or order directing  some act to be done in favor of the applicant.\"  Black's Law Dictionary  1013 (6th ed. 1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Papers simply \"acknowledging\" substantial  assistance are not sufficient if they do not indicate desire for, or  consent to, a sentence below the statutory minimum.<sup>5</sup></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the Government did more than simply \"acknowledge\" substantial assistance here: it moved the court to impose a sentence  below the Guideline range.  But we agree with the Government that  nothing in Section(s) 3553(e) suggests that a district court has power  to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum to reflect a  defendant's cooperation when the  Government has not authorized such a  sentence, but has instead moved for a departure only from the applicable  Guidelines range.  Nor does anything in Section(s) 3553(e) or Section(s)  994(n) suggest that the Commission itself may dispense with Section(s)   3553(e)'s motion requirement, or alternatively, \"deem\" a motion   requesting or authorizing different action - such as a departure  below  the Guidelines minimum - to be a motion authorizing the district court to depart below the statutory minimum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, we do not read Section(s) 5K1.1 as attempting to exercise this non-existent authority.  Section 5K1.1 says: \"Upon motion  of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial  assistance . . . the court may depart from the guidelines,\" while its  Application Note 1 says: \"Under circumstances set forth in 18 U. S. C.  Section(s) 3553(e) and 28 U. S. C. Section(s) 994(n) . . . substantial  assistance . . . may justify a sentence below a statutorily required  minimum sentence,\" Section(s) 5K1.1, comment., n. 1.  One of the circumstances set forth in Section(s) 3553(e) is, as we have explained  previously, that the Government has authorized the court to impose a  sentence below the statutory minimum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner and his <i>amici</i> argue that Section(s) 3553(e) requires  a sentence below the statutory minimum to be imposed in \"accordance\"  with the Guidelines; that Section(s) 994(n) specifically directs the  Commission to draft a provision covering substantial assistance cases,  including cases in which a sentence below a statutory minimum is  warranted; and that if Section(s) 5K1.1 is not read as creating a  unitary motion system, then the Commission has improperly failed to meet  its obligation, because no other provision of the Guidelines implements Section(s) 3553(e) and Section(s) 994(n).  They also  argue (1) that the  reference to Section(s) 3553(e) in Section(s) 5K1.1's Application Note 1  indicates that Section(s) 5K1.1 is a \"conduit\" established by the  Commission for \"implementation\" of Section(s) 3553(e); (2) that  Application Note 2's use of the broad term \"sentencing reduction,\"  rather than \"departure from the guidelines range,\" supports petitioner's  view that Section(s) 5K1.1 authorizes departures below a statutory  minimum;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  (3) that Application Note 3 makes sense only on the   assumption that the district court retains \"full discretionary power\"  over the extent of the sentencing reduction (<i>i.e.</i>, the authority to  choose any sentence once the Government makes any motion confirming the defendant's substantial assistance);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> (4) that the reference to Section(s) 5K1.1 alone (rather than to Section(s) 3553(e)) in USSG Section(s) 2D1.1's Application Note  7 further supports petitioner's  claim that Section(s) 5K1.1 is a conduit for implementation of  Section(s) 3553(e);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  and (5) that if the factors described in  Section(s) 5K1.1(a) limiting the district court's discretion do not  apply to sentences imposed after the Government moves to depart below  the statutory minimum, then the district court's discretion will be  wholly unlimited in those circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the Government's view, Section(s) 3553(e) already gives the  district court authority to depart below the statutory minimum on motion  to do so by the prosecutor.  The Government urges us to read the last  sentence of Section(s) 3553(e), and the inclusion of the phrase  \"including a sentence that is lower  than that established by statute as  a minimum sentence\" in Section(s) 994(n), as merely requiring the  Commission to constrain the district court's discretion in choosing a  sentence after the Government moves to depart below the statutory  minimum.  The Government contends that the first paragraph of Section(s)  5K1.1 does not authorize departures below the statutory minimum, but that Section(s) 5K1.1(a) does apply to sentences imposed after the Government moves to depart below the statutory minimum (as well as to  sentences imposed after the Government moves to depart below the  Guidelines range); Section(s) 5K1.1(a) thus implements the requirements  of Section(s) 3553(e) and Section(s) 994(n) that relate to sentences  below the statutory minimum, by requiring the district court to consider  the factors listed in Section(s) 5K1.1(a) (1)-(5) in determining the  appropriate extent of a departure below the statutory minimum.  According to the Government, the difficulties and gaps referred to by  petitioner vanish once Section(s) 5K1.1(a) is so construed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the Government that the relevant parts of the statutes merely charge the Commission with constraining the district  court's discretion in choosing a specific sentence after the Government  moves for a departure below the statutory minimum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Congress did  not charge the Commission with \"implementing\" Section(s) 3553(e)'s  Government motion requirement, beyond adopting provisions constraining  the district court's discretion regarding the particular sentence  selected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the various relevant Guidelines provisions invoked by  the parties could certainly be clearer, we also believe that the  Government's interpretation of the current provisions is the better one.  Section 5K1.1(a) may guide the district court when it selects a sentence  below the statutory minimum, as well when  it selects a sentence below  the Guidelines range.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>   The Commission has not, however,  improperly attempted to dispense with or modify the requirement for a  departure below the statutory minimum spelled out in Section(s) 3553(e)  - that of a Government motion requesting or authorizing a departure  below the statutory minimum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government has made no such motion here.  Hence, the District Court correctly concluded that it lacked the authority to sentence petitioner to less than 10 years' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is at stake in the long run is whether the Government can  make a motion authorizing the district court to depart below the  Guidelines range but withholding from the district court the power to  depart below the statutory minimum.  Although the Government contends  correctly that the Commission does not have authority to \"deem\" a  Government motion that does not authorize a departure below the  statutory minimum to be one that does authorize such a departure, the  Government apparently reads Section(s) 994(n) to permit the Commission  to construct a unitary motion system <i>by adjusting the requirements for a  departure below the Guidelines minimum</i> - that is, by providing that the  district court may depart below the Guidelines range only when the Government is willing to authorize the court to depart below the statutory minimum, if the court finds that to be appropriate.  See Tr.  of Oral Arg. 26-31.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether the Commission could create this second type of unitary motion system, for two reasons.  First, even if  the Commission had done so, that would not help petitioner, since the  Government has not authorized a departure below the statutory minimum  here.  Second, we agree with the Government that the Commission has not  adopted this type of unitary motion system.  Neither the text of  Section(s) 5K1.1 nor its commentary expressly limits the authority of  the court to depart below the Guidelines minimum to situations in which  the Government has moved to depart below the statutory minimum.  The text of Section(s) 5K1.1 says: \"Upon motion of the government stating  that the defendant has provided substantial assistance . . ., the court  may depart from the guidelines.\"  We do not read this sentence to say:  \"Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided  substantial assistance . . . <i>and authorizing the court to depart below  the statutory minimum, if any</i>, the court may depart from the  guidelines.\"  Rather, we read it as permitting the district court to  depart below the Guidelines range when the Government states that the  defendant has provided substantial assistance and requests or authorizes the district court to depart below the Guidelines range.  As we have  noted, <i>supra</i>, at 7-10, the Application Notes to Section(s) 5K1.1 and  Section(s) 2D1.1 do not compel any other reading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>djq  Justice Souter, concurring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I agree with the conclusion that 18 U. S. C. Section(s) 3553(e)  requires a motion by the Government asking the district court to impose  a sentence below the statutory minimum, but I part company with the  Court on the characterization of the policy statement numbered  Section(s) 5K1.1, United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual  Section(s) 5K1.1, p. s. (Nov. 1995) (USSG).  The text of this policy  statement deals with departures from the Guidelines; the best reading of  each sentence is that its referent is a guideline departure, and that  neither directly applies to reductions below mandatory minimums.  The  Application Notes (which are \"the legal equivalent of a policy  statement,\" USSG Section(s) 1B1.7) are where the Sentencing Commission  has dealt with sentences below statutory minimums. In my view, the Sentencing Commission has discharged its responsibility under 28 U. S.  C. Section(s) 994(n) by its inclusion of the Application Notes, which  effectively tell district courts that the policy statement applies as  well to motions for reductions below mandatory minimums.  Thus, my disagreement is over the suggestion that the two sentences of Section(s)  5K1.1 can be treated separately.  I would simply say that the  Application Notes indicate that Section(s) 5K1.1 applies to motions  under Section(s) 3553(e), and leave it at that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>djq  Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner has persuaded me that the Sentencing Commission intended Section(s) 5K1.1 to create a unitary motion system under which  any request for a departure below the guideline range based on  substantial assistance would also authorize a departure below the  statutory minimum.  Such a system would be eminently reasonable, but,  for two reasons, I am convinced that Congress did not intend to  authorize it.  First, I agree with the Court that the text of Section(s)  3553(e) does not authorize the court to impose a sentence below the  statutory minimum unless the Government has made a motion requesting  that relief.  Second, notwithstanding my serious doubts concerning the  wisdom of a congressional decision to impose statutory minimum sentences higher than those considered appropriate by the Commission, the very  fact that Congress has done so indicates that it intended to confer the  authority to dispense with the statutory minima on the prosecutor rather  than the Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, I concur in the judgment because I agree with the Court's  interpretation of Section(s) 3553(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>djq  Justice Breyer, with whom Justice O'Connor joins, concurring in  part and dissenting in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion, for, like the Court, I believe the Commission does not have the power to modify Congress' statutes.  I disagree with Part III, however, because the  Commission does have the power to write its own Guidelines and, in my  view, the Commission has in fact exercised that power to create what the  Court calls a \"unitary motion system.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To understand that system, one must keep in mind two facts. First, many \"substantial assistance\" departures involve departures only  from Guideline sentences, not from statutory mandatory minimum  sentences. When a defendant seeks a \"substantial assistance\" departure  from the minimum Guideline sentence for robbery, fraud, money  laundering, tax evasion, or most other offenses, the defendant need not  worry about a statutorily required minimum sentence, for either no such minimum sentence applies, or that sentence is so far below the minimum  Guideline sentence that there is no practical likelihood of a departure  drastic enough to make it relevant.  The Guidelines govern departures  from these Guideline sentences, and they permit judges to depart  downward for \"substantial assistance\" only if the Government makes a  \"motion . . . stating that the defendant has provided substantial  assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has  committed an offense.\"  United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual Section(s) 5K1.1, p. s. (Nov. 1995) (USSG).  I call the policy  statement that sets forth this rule the \"Substantial Assistance  Guideline.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, some criminal convictions implicate not only the Guidelines, but also the special statutes (applicable particularly to  drug and weapon offenses) that set \"mandatory minimum\" sentences.  See  United States Sentencing Commission, Mandatory Minimum Penalties in the  Federal Criminal Justice System, Appendix A, pp. A1-A8 (Aug. 1991)  (Mandatory Minimum Penalties). The law does not normally permit a  departure below  such mandatory statutory minimums.  But cf. 18 U. S. C.  Section(s) 3553(f) (limitation on applicability of statutory minimums in certain cases); USSG Section(s) 5C1.2 (same).  The law does permit such  a departure, however, for one special reason, namely, \"substantial  assistance,\" but only if the Government makes a \"motion . . . so as to  reflect a defendant's  substantial assistance in the investigation or  prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\"  18 U. S.  C. Section(s) 3553(e). I shall call the statute that states this rule  the \"Substantial Assistance Statute.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these two basic facts in mind, one might ask what the Commission means by the term \"substantial assistance\" in its Substantial  Assistance Guideline.  In particular, do those words in that Guideline  mean the same thing that those same words mean in the Substantial  Assistance Statute?  Or does the Commission intend those words in its  Guideline to create a tougher, or perhaps a more lenient, standard where  departures from Guideline minimums (rather than departures from  statutory minimums) are at issue?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The answer to this interpretive question, in my view, is that the Commission means the term \"substantial assistance\" in its Substantial Assistance Guideline to create the same standard that the  Substantial Assistance Statute creates using the same words. As so  interpreted, the Guideline authorizes a sentencing judge to depart  downward from a Guideline sentence for substantial assistance only if  the Government files the same kind of motion that the Government would  file to obtain a departure from a statutory minimum sentence, were such  a sentence at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My reasons for believing that the Commission intended to tie its  Substantial Assistance Guideline to the Substantial Assistance Statute   (thereby recognizing one kind of \"substantial assistance,\" not two) are  the following: First, as  I have said, the language the Commission used  to write its Substantial Assistance Guideline is virtually identical to  the language that appears in the Substantial Assistance Statute. Compare  USSG Section(s) 5K1.1, p. s., with 18 U. S. C. Section(s) 3553(e). Second, the Commission nowhere suggests that the key words \"substantial  assistance\" mean something different  in the two places (the Guideline  and the Statute) where they appear, and I cannot imagine any reason why  the Commission would have wanted to create different standards through  the use of identical words, thereby creating additional administrative  complexity and risking unnecessary confusion.  Third, the Commission's  commentary refers to statutory and guideline departures  indiscriminately.  USSG Section(s) 2D1.1, comment., n. 7 (citing  Substantial Assistance Guideline for proposition that statutory minimum  may be \"waived\"); see also Mandatory Minimum Penalties, <i>supra</i>, at 59 (discussing unitary \"substantial assistance motions\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court's reason for reaching the contrary conclusion is that  the Commission did not specify that courts could not depart below a  minimum Guideline sentence without a Government motion for departure  below any applicable statutory minimum.  That is, the Substantial  Assistance Guideline does not say: \"Upon motion of the government  stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance . . . and  authorizing the court to depart below the statutory minimum, if any, the  court may depart from the guidelines.\"  <i>Ante,</i> at 11 (emphasis added;  internal quotation marks omitted).  But it is not surprising that the  Commission neglected to add these words of crystal clarity to the Substantial Assistance Guideline, since that Guideline governs many  cases that have nothing to do with mandatory minimum sentences.  It  makes sense, instead, for the Commission to have noted the interplay of  \"substantial assistance\" and statutory minimums in its commentary to the  Substantial Assistance Guideline, see USSG Section(s) 5K1.1, p. s.,  comment., n. 1, and in its section on drug offenses, for which statutory  minimums are relatively common, see <i>id.,</i> Section(s) 2D1.1, comment., n.  7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I recognize that the Court, through its interpretation of the  Guideline, avoids having to decide \"whether the Commission could create  this . . . unitary motion system.\"  <i>Ante,</i> at 10. But the legal question  it avoids is not a difficult one. Congress delegated to the Commission  broad authority to determine when sentencing courts may reward  substantial assistance with a reduced sentence.  See 28 U. S. C.  Section(s)  994(n).  The Commission's exercise of delegated authority is  normally lawful as long as it is reasonable.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>United States</i>  v. <i>Shabazz</i>, 933 F. 2d 1029, 1035 (CADC) (Thomas, J.) (citing <i>Chevron U.  S. A. Inc.</i> v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council</i>, Inc., 467 U. S. 837,  842-845 (1984)), cert. denied sub  nom. <i>McNeil</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 502 U.  S. 964 (1991).  And a unitary system seems perfectly reasonable. Indeed,  the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure recognize an identical \"unitary\"  system for post-judgment substantial assistance motions.  See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 35(b) (\"[O]n motion of the Government made within one year  after the imposition of the sentence,\" court may reduce sentence \"to  reflect a defendant's subsequent, substantial assistance\"; this may  include reduction \"to a level  below that established by statute as a  minimum sentence\").  Thus in my view, the Commission had the power to  create a \"unitary motion system,\" and is free to maintain such a system,  or to change it, in light of evolving criminal justice policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the lower courts accepted the Government's \"departure\" motion as sufficient to justify a departure below the 135-month Guideline minimum applicable to petitioner's crime, but not  sufficient to justify a departure below the applicable 10-year statutory  minimum. On a \"unitary\" view, this disposition could not be correct.  Either the motion was sufficient to warrant a departure below the  statutory minimum, or it was insufficient to warrant a departure below  the Guideline minimum.  I would remand this case to the lower courts for  further consideration of this case-specific issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, while agreeing with much of what the Court has written, I dissent from its disposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Compare 55 F. 3d 130 (CA3 1995), and <i>United States</i> v. <i>Rodriguez-Morales</i>, 958 F. 2d 1441 (CA8), cert. denied, 506 U.

See Reply Brief for Petitioner 7-8.  We do not view this issue  as included within the question upon which we granted certiorari, see  Pet. for Cert. 3 (\"Did the sentencing court have the discretion to  depart below the applicable statutory minimum once the United States  moved for departure under USSG Section(s) 5K1, without the requirement  of a second government departure application under 18 U.
