Pub. L. 104\u0097 132, 110 Stat. 1217. We hold that the Act does not preclude this Court from entertaining an application for habeas corpus relief, although it does affect the standards governing the granting of such relief. We also conclude that the availability of such relief in this Court obviates any claim by petitioner under the Exceptions Clause of Article III, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution, and that the operative provisions of the Act do not violate the Suspension Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>On a night in 1976, petitioner approached Jane W. in his car as she got out of hers. Claiming to be lost and looking for a party nearby, he used a series of deceptions to induce Jane to accompany him to his trailer home in town. Petitioner <span class=\"star-pagination\">*655</span> forcibly subdued her, raped her, and sodomized her. Jane pleaded with petitioner to let her go, but he said he could not because she would notify the police. She escaped later, when petitioner fell asleep. Jane notified the police, and petitioner was eventually convicted of aggravated sodomy and sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Petitioner was paroled four years later. On November 23, 1981, he met Joy Ludlam, a cocktail waitress, at the lounge where she worked. She was interested in changing jobs, and petitioner used a series of deceptions involving offering her a job at \"The Leather Shoppe,\" a business he owned, to induce her to visit him the next day. The last time Joy was seen alive was the evening of the next day. Her dead body was discovered two weeks later in a creek. Forensic analysis established that she had been beaten, raped, and sodomized, and that she had been strangled to death before being left in the creek. Investigators discovered hair resembling petitioner's on Joy's body and clothes, hair resembling Joy's in petitioner's bedroom, and clothing fibers like those in Joy's coat in the hatchback of petitioner's car. One of petitioner's neighbors reported seeing Joy's car at petitioner's house the day she disappeared.</p>\n<p>A jury convicted petitioner of murder, rape, aggravated sodomy, and false imprisonment. Petitioner was sentenced to death on the murder charge. The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's conviction and death sentence, <i>Felker</i> v. <i>State,</i> 252 Ga. 351, 314 S. E. 2d 621, and we denied certiorari, 469 U. S. 873 (1984). A state trial court denied collateral relief, the Georgia Supreme Court declined to issue a certificate of probable cause to appeal the denial, and we again denied certiorari. <i>Felker</i> v. <i>Zant,</i> 502 U. S. 1064 (1992).</p>\n<p>Petitioner then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia, alleging that (1) the State's evidence was insufficient <span class=\"star-pagination\">*656</span> to convict him; (2) the State withheld exculpatory evidence, in violation of <i>Brady</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> 373 U. S. 83 (1963); (3) petitioner's counsel rendered ineffective assistance at sentencing; (4) the State improperly used hypnosis to refresh a witness' memory; and (5) the State violated double jeopardy and collateral estoppel principles by using petitioner's crime against Jane W. as evidence at petitioner's trial for crimes against Joy Ludlam. The District Court denied the petition. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, 52 F. 3d 907, extended on denial of petition for rehearing, 62 F. 3d 342 (1995), and we denied certiorari, 516 U. S. 1133 (1996).</p>\n<p>The State scheduled petitioner's execution for the period May 2-9, 1996. On April 29, 1996, petitioner filed a second petition for state collateral relief. The state trial court denied this petition on May 1, and the Georgia Supreme Court denied certiorari on May 2.</p>\n<p>On April 24, 1996, the President signed the Act into law. Title I of this Act contained a series of amendments to existing federal habeas corpus law. The provisions of the Act pertinent to this case concern second or successive habeas corpus applications by state prisoners. Section 106(b) specifies the conditions under which claims in second or successive applications must be dismissed, amending 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244(b) to read:</p>\n<p>\"(1) A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.</p>\n<p>\"(2) A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was not presented in a prior application shall be dismissed unless\u0097</p>\n<p>\"(A) the applicant shows that the claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable; or</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*657</span> \"(B)(i) the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence; and</p>\n<p>\"(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.\"</p>\n<p>Title 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. II) creates a \"gatekeeping\" mechanism for the consideration of second or successive applications in district court. The prospective applicant must file in the court of appeals a motion for leave to file a second or successive habeas application in the district court. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). A three-judge panel has 30 days to determine whether \"the application makes a prima facie showing that the application satisfies the requirements of\" \u00a7 2244(b). \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C); see \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(B), (D). Section 2244(b)(3)(E) specifies that \"[t]he grant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals to file a second or successive application shall not be appealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\"</p>\n<p>On May 2, 1996, petitioner filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit a motion for stay of execution and a motion for leave to file a second or successive federal habeas corpus petition under \u00a7 2254. Petitioner sought to raise two claims in his second petition, the first being that the state trial court violated due process by equating guilt \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" with \"moral certainty\" of guilt in <i>voir dire</i> and jury instructions. See <i>Cage</i>  v. <i>Louisiana,</i> 498 U. S. 39 (1990) <i>(per curiam)</i> . He also alleged that qualified experts, reviewing the forensic evidence after his conviction, had established that Joy must have died during a period when petitioner was under police surveillance for Joy's disappearance and thus had a valid <span class=\"star-pagination\">*658</span> alibi. He claimed that the testimony of the State's forensic expert at trial was suspect because he is not a licensed physician, and that the new expert testimony so discredited the State's testimony at trial that petitioner had a colorable claim of factual innocence.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals denied both motions the day they were filed, concluding that petitioner's claims had not been presented in his first habeas petition, that they did not meet the standards of \u00a7 2244(b)(2), and that they would not have satisfied pre-Act standards for obtaining review on the merits of second or successive claims. 83 F. 3d 1303 (CA11 1996). Petitioner filed in this Court a pleading styled a \"Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, for Appellate or Certiorari Review of the Decision of the United States Circuit Court for the Eleventh Circuit, and for Stay of Execution.\" On May 3, we granted petitioner's stay application and petition for certiorari. We ordered briefing on the extent to which the provisions of Title I of the Act apply to a petition for habeas corpus filed in this Court, whether application of the Act suspended the writ of habeas corpus in this case, and whether Title I of the Act, especially the provision to be codified at \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E), constitutes an unconstitutional restriction on the jurisdiction of this Court. 517 U. S. 1182 (1996).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We first consider to what extent the provisions of Title I of the Act apply to petitions for habeas corpus filed as original matters in this Court pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241 and 2254. We conclude that although the Act does impose new conditions on our authority to grant relief, it does not deprive this Court of jurisdiction to entertain original habeas petitions.</p>\n<p>A</p>\n<p>Section 2244(b)(3)(E) prevents this Court from reviewing a court of appeals order denying leave to file a second habeas <span class=\"star-pagination\">*659</span> petition by appeal or by writ of certiorari. More than a century ago, we considered whether a statute barring review by appeal of the judgment of a circuit court in a habeas case also deprived this Court of power to entertain an original habeas petition. <i>Ex parte Yerger,</i> 8 Wall. 85 (1869). We consider the same question here with respect to \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E).</p>\n<p><i>Yerger</i> `s holding is best understood in the light of the availability of habeas corpus review at that time. Section 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 authorized all federal courts, including this Court, to grant the writ of habeas corpus when prisoners were \"in custody, under or by colour of the authority of the United States, or [were] committed for trial before some court of the same.\" Act of Sept. 24, 1789, ch. 20, \u00a7 14, 1 Stat. 82.<sup>[1]</sup> Congress greatly expanded the scope of federal habeas corpus in 1867, authorizing federal courts to grant the writ, \"in addition to the authority already conferred by law,\" \"in all cases where any person may be restrained of his or her liberty in violation of the constitution, or of any treaty or law of the United States.\" Act of Feb. 5, 1867, ch. 28, 14 Stat. 385.<sup>[2]</sup> Before the Act of 1867, the only instances in which a federal court could issue the writ to produce a state prisoner were if the prisoner was \"necessary to be brought into court to testify,\" Act of Sept. 24, 1789, ch. 20, \u00a7 14, 1 Stat. 82, was \"committed . . . for any act done . . . in pursuance of a law of the United States,\" Act of Mar. 2, 1833, ch. 57, \u00a7 7, 4 Stat. 634-635, or was a \"subjec[t] or citize[n] of a foreign <span class=\"star-pagination\">*660</span> State, and domiciled therein,\" and held under state law, Act of Aug. 29, 1842, ch. 257, 5 Stat. 539-540.</p>\n<p>The Act of 1867 also expanded our statutory appellate jurisdiction to authorize appeals to this Court from the final decision of any circuit court on a habeas petition. 14 Stat. 386. This enactment changed the result of <i>Barry</i> v. <i>Mercein,</i> 5 How. 103 (1847), in which we had held that the Judiciary Act of 1789 did not authorize this Court to conduct appellate review of circuit court habeas decisions. However, in 1868, Congress revoked the appellate jurisdiction it had given in 1867, repealing \"so much of the [Act of 1867] as authorizes an appeal from the judgment of the circuit court to the Supreme Court of the United States.\" Act of Mar. 27, 1868, ch. 34, \u00a7 2, 15 Stat. 44.</p>\n<p>In <i>Yerger,</i> we considered whether the Act of 1868 deprived us not only of power to hear an appeal from an inferior court's decision on a habeas petition, but also of power to entertain a habeas petition to this Court under \u00a7 14 of the Act of 1789. We concluded that the 1868 Act did not affect our power to entertain such habeas petitions. We explained that the 1868 Act's text addressed only jurisdiction over appeals conferred under the Act of 1867, not habeas jurisdiction conferred under the Acts of 1789 and 1867. We rejected the suggestion that the Act of 1867 had repealed our habeas power by implication. <i>Yerger,</i> 8 Wall., at 105. Repeals by implication are not favored, we said, and the continued exercise of original habeas jurisdiction was not \"repugnant\" to a prohibition on review by appeal of circuit court habeas judgments. <i>Ibid.</i> </p>\n<p>Turning to the present case, we conclude that Title I of the Act has not repealed our authority to entertain original habeas petitions, for reasons similar to those stated in <i>Yerger.</i> No provision of Title I mentions our authority to entertain original habeas petitions; in contrast, \u00a7 103 amends the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure to bar consideration <span class=\"star-pagination\">*661</span> of original habeas petitions in the courts of appeals.<sup>[3]</sup> Although \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E) precludes us from reviewing, by appeal or petition for certiorari, a judgment on an application for leave to file a second habeas petition in district court, it makes no mention of our authority to hear habeas petitions filed as original matters in this Court. As we declined to find a repeal of \u00a7 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 as applied to this Court by implication then, we decline to find a similar repeal of \u00a7 2241 of Title 28\u0097its descendant, n. 1, <i>supra</i> \u0097by implication now.</p>\n<p>This conclusion obviates one of the constitutional challenges raised. The critical language of Article III, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution provides that, apart from several classes of cases specifically enumerated in this Court's original jurisdiction, \"[i]n all the other Cases . . . the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.\" Previous decisions construing this clause have said that while our appellate powers \"are given by the constitution,\" \"they are limited and regulated by the [Judiciary Act of 1789], and by such other acts as have been passed on the subject.\" <i>Durousseau</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 6 Cranch 307, 314 (1810); see also <i>United States</i> v. <i>More,</i> 3 Cranch 159, 172-173 (1805). The Act does remove our authority to entertain an appeal or a petition for a writ of certiorari to review a decision of a court of appeals exercising its \"gatekeeping\" function over a second petition. But since it does not repeal our authority to entertain a petition for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*662</span> habeas corpus, there can be no plausible argument that the Act has deprived this Court of appellate jurisdiction in violation of Article III, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p>B</p>\n<p>We consider next how Title I affects the requirements a state prisoner must satisfy to show he is entitled to a writ of habeas corpus from this Court. Title I of the Act has changed the standards governing our consideration of habeas petitions by imposing new requirements for the granting of relief to state prisoners. Our authority to grant habeas relief to state prisoners is limited by \u00a7 2254, which specifies the conditions under which such relief may be granted to \"a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.\"<sup>[4]</sup> \u00a7 2254(a). Several sections of the Act impose new requirements for the granting of relief under this section, and they therefore inform our authority to grant such relief as well.</p>\n<p>Section 2244(b) addresses second or successive habeas petitions. Section 2244(b)(3)'s \"gatekeeping\" system for second petitions does not apply to our consideration of habeas petitions because it applies to applications \"filed in the district court.\" \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). There is no such limitation, however, on the restrictions on repetitive and new claims imposed by \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(1) and (2). These restrictions apply without qualification to any \"second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254.\" \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(1), (2). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*663</span> Whether or not we are bound by these restrictions, they certainly inform our consideration of original habeas petitions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Next, we consider whether the Act suspends the writ of habeas corpus in violation of Article I, \u00a7 9, clause 2, of the Constitution. This Clause provides that \"[t]he Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\"</p>\n<p>The writ of habeas corpus known to the Framers was quite different from that which exists today. As we explained previously, the first Congress made the writ of habeas corpus available only to prisoners confined under the authority of the United States, not under state authority. <i>Supra,</i> at 659\u0097 660; see <i>Ex parte Dorr,</i> 3 How. 103 (1844). The class of judicial actions reviewable by the writ was more restricted as well. In <i>Ex parte Watkins,</i> 3 Pet. 193 (1830), we denied a petition for a writ of habeas corpus from a prisoner \"detained in prison by virtue of the judgment of a court, which court possesses general and final jurisdiction in criminal cases.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 202. Reviewing the English common law which informed American courts' understanding of the scope of the writ, we held that \"[t]he judgment of the circuit court in a criminal case is of itself evidence of its own legality,\" and that we could not \"usurp that power by the instrumentality of the writ of habeas corpus.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 207.</p>\n<p>It was not until 1867 that Congress made the writ generally available in \"all cases where any person may be restrained of his or her liberty in violation of the constitution, or of any treaty or law of the United States.\" <i>Supra,</i> at 659. And it was not until well into this century that this Court interpreted that provision to allow a final judgment of conviction in a state court to be collaterally attacked on habeas. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Waley</i> v. <i>Johnston,</i> 316 U. S. 101 (1942) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>Brown</i> v. <i>Allen,</i> 344 U. S. 443 (1953). But we assume, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*664</span> for purposes of decision here, that the Suspension Clause of the Constitution refers to the writ as it exists today, rather than as it existed in 1789. See <i>Swain</i> v. <i>Pressley,</i> 430 U. S. 372 (1977); <i>id.,</i> at 384 (Burger, C. J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>The Act requires a habeas petitioner to obtain leave from the court of appeals before filing a second habeas petition in the district court. But this requirement simply transfers from the district court to the court of appeals a screening function which would previously have been performed by the district court as required by 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254 Rule 9(b). The Act also codifies some of the pre-existing limits on successive petitions, and further restricts the availability of relief to habeas petitioners. But we have long recognized that \"the power to award the writ by any of the courts of the United States, must be given by written law,\" <i>Ex parte Bollman,</i> 4 Cranch 75, 94 (1807), and we have likewise recognized that judgments about the proper scope of the writ are \"normally for Congress to make.\" <i>Lonchar</i> v. <i>Thomas,</i> 517 U. S. 314, 323 (1996).</p>\n<p>The new restrictions on successive petitions constitute a modified res judicata rule, a restraint on what is called in habeas corpus practice \"abuse of the writ.\" In <i>McCleskey</i>  v. <i>Zant,</i> 499 U. S. 467 (1991), we said that \"the doctrine of abuse of the writ refers to a complex and evolving body of equitable principles informed and controlled by historical usage, statutory developments, and judicial decisions.\" <i>Id.,</i>  at 489. The added restrictions which the Act places on second habeas petitions are well within the compass of this evolutionary process, and we hold that they do not amount to a \"suspension\" of the writ contrary to Article I, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>We have answered the questions presented by the petition for certiorari in this case, and we now dispose of the petition <span class=\"star-pagination\">*665</span> for an original writ of habeas corpus. Our Rule 20.4(a) delineates the standards under which we grant such writs:</p>\n<p>\"A petition seeking the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus shall comply with the requirements of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241 and 2242, and in particular with the provision in the last paragraph of \u00a7 2242 requiring a statement of the `reasons for not making application to the district court of the district in which the applicant is held.' If the relief sought is from the judgment of a state court, the petition shall set forth specifically how and wherein the petitioner has exhausted available remedies in the state courts or otherwise comes within the provisions of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254(b). To justify the granting of a writ of habeas corpus, the petitioner must show exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of the Court's discretionary powers and must show that adequate relief cannot be obtained in any other form or from any other court. These writs are rarely granted.\"</p>\n<p>Reviewing petitioner's claims here, they do not materially differ from numerous other claims made by successive habeas petitioners which we have had occasion to review on stay applications to this Court. Neither of them satisfies the requirements of the relevant provisions of the Act, let alone the requirement that there be \"exceptional circumstances\" justifying the issuance of the writ.</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>The petition for writ of certiorari is dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The petition for an original writ of habeas corpus is denied.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i>  Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter and Justice Breyer join, concurring.</p>\n<p>While I join the Court's opinion, I believe its response to the argument that the Act has deprived this Court of appellate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*666</span> jurisdiction in violation of Article III, \u00a7 2, is incomplete. I therefore add this brief comment.</p>\n<p>As the Court correctly concludes, the Act does not divest this Court of jurisdiction to grant petitioner relief by issuing a writ of habeas corpus. It does, however, except the category of orders entered by the courts of appeals pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. II) from this Court's statutory jurisdiction to review cases in the courts of appeals pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1254(1). The Act does not purport to limit our jurisdiction under that section to review interlocutory orders in such cases, to limit our jurisdiction under \u00a7 1254(2), or to limit our jurisdiction under the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1651.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, there are at least three reasons for rejecting petitioner's argument that the limited exception violates Article III, \u00a7 2. First, if we retain jurisdiction to review the gatekeeping orders pursuant to the All Writs Act\u0097and petitioner has not suggested otherwise\u0097such orders are not immune from direct review. Second, by entering an appropriate interlocutory order, a court of appeals may provide this Court with an opportunity to review its proposed disposition of a motion for leave to file a second or successive habeas application. Third, in the exercise of our habeas corpus jurisdiction, we may consider earlier gatekeeping orders entered by the court of appeals to inform our judgments and provide the parties with the functional equivalent of direct review. In this case the Court correctly denies the writ of habeas corpus because petitioner's claims do not satisfy the requirements of our pre-Act jurisprudence or the requirements of the Act, including the standards governing the court of appeals' gatekeeping function.</p>\n<p>Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer join, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the Court's opinion. The Court holds today that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1217, precludes our review, by \"certiorari\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*667</span> or by \"appeal,\" over the courts of appeals's \"gatekeeper\" determinations. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E) (1994 ed., Supp. II). The statute's text does not necessarily foreclose all of our appellate jurisdiction, see, <i>e. g.,</i> 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1254(2) (certified questions from courts of appeals); \u00a7 1651(a) (authority to issue appropriate writs in aid of another exercise of appellate jurisdiction); this Court's Rule 20.3 (procedure for petitions for extraordinary writs), nor has Congress repealed our authority to entertain original petitions for writs of habeas corpus.<sup>[1]</sup> Because petitioner sought only a writ of certiorari (which Congress has foreclosed) and a writ of habeas corpus (which, even applying the traditional criteria, we would choose to deny, see <i>ante,</i> at 664-665), I have no difficulty with the conclusion that the statute is not on its face, or as applied here, unconstitutional. I write only to add that if it should later turn out that statutory avenues other than certiorari for reviewing a gatekeeping determination were closed, the question whether the statute exceeded Congress's Exceptions Clause power would be open.<sup>[2]</sup> The question could arise if the courts of appeals adopted divergent interpretations of the gatekeeper standard.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging affirmance were filed for the Washington Legal Foundation et al. by <i>Ronald D.

[h]e is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  Section 103 of the Act amends Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 22(a) to read: \"An application for a writ of habeas corpus shall be made to the appropriate district court. If application is made to a circuit judge, the application shall be transferred to the appropriate district court. If an application is made to or transferred to the district court and denied, renewal of the application before a circuit judge shall not be permitted. The applicant may, pursuant to section 2253 of title 28, United States Code, appeal to the appropriate court of appeals from the order of the district court denying the writ.\"</p>\n<p>[4]  As originally enacted in 1948, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254 specified that \"[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State.\" 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254 (1946 ed.,Supp. III). The reviser's notes, citing <i>Ex parte Hawk,</i> 321 U.

Pub. L. 104\u0097 132, 110 Stat. 1217. We hold that the Act does not preclude this Court from entertaining an application for habeas corpus relief, although it does affect the standards governing the granting of such relief. We also conclude that the availability of such relief in this Court obviates any claim by petitioner under the Exceptions Clause of Article III, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution, and that the operative provisions of the Act do not violate the Suspension Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>On a night in 1976, petitioner approached Jane W. in his car as she got out of hers. Claiming to be lost and looking for a party nearby, he used a series of deceptions to induce Jane to accompany him to his trailer home in town. Petitioner <span class=\"star-pagination\">*655</span> forcibly subdued her, raped her, and sodomized her. Jane pleaded with petitioner to let her go, but he said he could not because she would notify the police. She escaped later, when petitioner fell asleep. Jane notified the police, and petitioner was eventually convicted of aggravated sodomy and sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Petitioner was paroled four years later. On November 23, 1981, he met Joy Ludlam, a cocktail waitress, at the lounge where she worked. She was interested in changing jobs, and petitioner used a series of deceptions involving offering her a job at \"The Leather Shoppe,\" a business he owned, to induce her to visit him the next day. The last time Joy was seen alive was the evening of the next day. Her dead body was discovered two weeks later in a creek. Forensic analysis established that she had been beaten, raped, and sodomized, and that she had been strangled to death before being left in the creek. Investigators discovered hair resembling petitioner's on Joy's body and clothes, hair resembling Joy's in petitioner's bedroom, and clothing fibers like those in Joy's coat in the hatchback of petitioner's car. One of petitioner's neighbors reported seeing Joy's car at petitioner's house the day she disappeared.</p>\n<p>A jury convicted petitioner of murder, rape, aggravated sodomy, and false imprisonment. Petitioner was sentenced to death on the murder charge. The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's conviction and death sentence, <i>Felker</i> v. <i>State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1257587\"><a href=\"/opinion/1257587/felker-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ga.</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span>, 314 S. E. 2d 621, and we denied certiorari, 469 U. S. 873 (1984). A state trial court denied collateral relief, the Georgia Supreme Court declined to issue a certificate of probable cause to appeal the denial, and we again denied certiorari. <i>Felker</i> v. <i>Zant,</i> 502 U. S. 1064 (1992).</p>\n<p>Petitioner then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia, alleging that (1) the State's evidence was insufficient <span class=\"star-pagination\">*656</span> to convict him; (2) the State withheld exculpatory evidence, in violation of <i>Brady</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> 373 U. S. 83 (1963); (3) petitioner's counsel rendered ineffective assistance at sentencing; (4) the State improperly used hypnosis to refresh a witness' memory; and (5) the State violated double jeopardy and collateral estoppel principles by using petitioner's crime against Jane W. as evidence at petitioner's trial for crimes against Joy Ludlam. The District Court denied the petition. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, 52 F. 3d 907, extended on denial of petition for rehearing, 62 F. 3d 342 (1995), and we denied certiorari, 516 U. S. 1133 (1996).</p>\n<p>The State scheduled petitioner's execution for the period May 2-9, 1996. On April 29, 1996, petitioner filed a second petition for state collateral relief. The state trial court denied this petition on May 1, and the Georgia Supreme Court denied certiorari on May 2.</p>\n<p>On April 24, 1996, the President signed the Act into law. Title I of this Act contained a series of amendments to existing federal habeas corpus law. The provisions of the Act pertinent to this case concern second or successive habeas corpus applications by state prisoners. Section 106(b) specifies the conditions under which claims in second or successive applications must be dismissed, amending 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244(b) to read:</p>\n<p>\"(1) A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.</p>\n<p>\"(2) A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was not presented in a prior application shall be dismissed unless\u0097</p>\n<p>\"(A) the applicant shows that the claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable; or</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*657</span> \"(B)(i) the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence; and</p>\n<p>\"(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.\"</p>\n<p>Title 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. II) creates a \"gatekeeping\" mechanism for the consideration of second or successive applications in district court. The prospective applicant must file in the court of appeals a motion for leave to file a second or successive habeas application in the district court. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). A three-judge panel has 30 days to determine whether \"the application makes a prima facie showing that the application satisfies the requirements of\" \u00a7 2244(b). \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C); see \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(B), (D). Section 2244(b)(3)(E) specifies that \"[t]he grant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals to file a second or successive application shall not be appealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\"</p>\n<p>On May 2, 1996, petitioner filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit a motion for stay of execution and a motion for leave to file a second or successive federal habeas corpus petition under \u00a7 2254. Petitioner sought to raise two claims in his second petition, the first being that the state trial court violated due process by equating guilt \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" with \"moral certainty\" of guilt in <i>voir dire</i> and jury instructions. See <i>Cage</i>  v. <i>Louisiana,</i> 498 U. S. 39 (1990) <i>(per curiam)</i> . He also alleged that qualified experts, reviewing the forensic evidence after his conviction, had established that Joy must have died during a period when petitioner was under police surveillance for Joy's disappearance and thus had a valid <span class=\"star-pagination\">*658</span> alibi. He claimed that the testimony of the State's forensic expert at trial was suspect because he is not a licensed physician, and that the new expert testimony so discredited the State's testimony at trial that petitioner had a colorable claim of factual innocence.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals denied both motions the day they were filed, concluding that petitioner's claims had not been presented in his first habeas petition, that they did not meet the standards of \u00a7 2244(b)(2), and that they would not have satisfied pre-Act standards for obtaining review on the merits of second or successive claims. 83 F. 3d 1303 (CA11 1996). Petitioner filed in this Court a pleading styled a \"Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, for Appellate or Certiorari Review of the Decision of the United States Circuit Court for the Eleventh Circuit, and for Stay of Execution.\" On May 3, we granted petitioner's stay application and petition for certiorari. We ordered briefing on the extent to which the provisions of Title I of the Act apply to a petition for habeas corpus filed in this Court, whether application of the Act suspended the writ of habeas corpus in this case, and whether Title I of the Act, especially the provision to be codified at \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E), constitutes an unconstitutional restriction on the jurisdiction of this Court. 517 U. S. 1182 (1996).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We first consider to what extent the provisions of Title I of the Act apply to petitions for habeas corpus filed as original matters in this Court pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241 and 2254. We conclude that although the Act does impose new conditions on our authority to grant relief, it does not deprive this Court of jurisdiction to entertain original habeas petitions.</p>\n<p>A</p>\n<p>Section 2244(b)(3)(E) prevents this Court from reviewing a court of appeals order denying leave to file a second habeas <span class=\"star-pagination\">*659</span> petition by appeal or by writ of certiorari. More than a century ago, we considered whether a statute barring review by appeal of the judgment of a circuit court in a habeas case also deprived this Court of power to entertain an original habeas petition. <i>Ex parte Yerger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88072\"><a href=\"/opinion/88072/ex-parte-yerger/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span> (1869). We consider the same question here with respect to \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E).</p>\n<p><i>Yerger</i> `s holding is best understood in the light of the availability of habeas corpus review at that time. Section 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 authorized all federal courts, including this Court, to grant the writ of habeas corpus when prisoners were \"in custody, under or by colour of the authority of the United States, or [were] committed for trial before some court of the same.\" Act of Sept. 24, 1789, ch. 20, \u00a7 14, 1 Stat. 82.<sup>[1]</sup> Congress greatly expanded the scope of federal habeas corpus in 1867, authorizing federal courts to grant the writ, \"in addition to the authority already conferred by law,\" \"in all cases where any person may be restrained of his or her liberty in violation of the constitution, or of any treaty or law of the United States.\" Act of Feb. 5, 1867, ch. 28, 14 Stat. 385.<sup>[2]</sup> Before the Act of 1867, the only instances in which a federal court could issue the writ to produce a state prisoner were if the prisoner was \"necessary to be brought into court to testify,\" Act of Sept. 24, 1789, ch. 20, \u00a7 14, 1 Stat. 82, was \"committed . . . for any act done . . . in pursuance of a law of the United States,\" Act of Mar. 2, 1833, ch. 57, \u00a7 7, 4 Stat. 634-635, or was a \"subjec[t] or citize[n] of a foreign <span class=\"star-pagination\">*660</span> State, and domiciled therein,\" and held under state law, Act of Aug. 29, 1842, ch. 257, 5 Stat. 539-540.</p>\n<p>The Act of 1867 also expanded our statutory appellate jurisdiction to authorize appeals to this Court from the final decision of any circuit court on a habeas petition. 14 Stat. 386. This enactment changed the result of <i>Barry</i> v. <i>Mercein,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86408\"><a href=\"/opinion/86408/barry-v-mercein/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span> (1847), in which we had held that the Judiciary Act of 1789 did not authorize this Court to conduct appellate review of circuit court habeas decisions. However, in 1868, Congress revoked the appellate jurisdiction it had given in 1867, repealing \"so much of the [Act of 1867] as authorizes an appeal from the judgment of the circuit court to the Supreme Court of the United States.\" Act of Mar. 27, 1868, ch. 34, \u00a7 2, 15 Stat. 44.</p>\n<p>In <i>Yerger,</i> we considered whether the Act of 1868 deprived us not only of power to hear an appeal from an inferior court's decision on a habeas petition, but also of power to entertain a habeas petition to this Court under \u00a7 14 of the Act of 1789. We concluded that the 1868 Act did not affect our power to entertain such habeas petitions. We explained that the 1868 Act's text addressed only jurisdiction over appeals conferred under the Act of 1867, not habeas jurisdiction conferred under the Acts of 1789 and 1867. We rejected the suggestion that the Act of 1867 had repealed our habeas power by implication. <i>Yerger,</i> 8 Wall., at 105. Repeals by implication are not favored, we said, and the continued exercise of original habeas jurisdiction was not \"repugnant\" to a prohibition on review by appeal of circuit court habeas judgments. <i>Ibid.</i> </p>\n<p>Turning to the present case, we conclude that Title I of the Act has not repealed our authority to entertain original habeas petitions, for reasons similar to those stated in <i>Yerger.</i> No provision of Title I mentions our authority to entertain original habeas petitions; in contrast, \u00a7 103 amends the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure to bar consideration <span class=\"star-pagination\">*661</span> of original habeas petitions in the courts of appeals.<sup>[3]</sup> Although \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E) precludes us from reviewing, by appeal or petition for certiorari, a judgment on an application for leave to file a second habeas petition in district court, it makes no mention of our authority to hear habeas petitions filed as original matters in this Court. As we declined to find a repeal of \u00a7 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 as applied to this Court by implication then, we decline to find a similar repeal of \u00a7 2241 of Title 28\u0097its descendant, n. 1, <i>supra</i> \u0097by implication now.</p>\n<p>This conclusion obviates one of the constitutional challenges raised. The critical language of Article III, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution provides that, apart from several classes of cases specifically enumerated in this Court's original jurisdiction, \"[i]n all the other Cases . . . the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.\" Previous decisions construing this clause have said that while our appellate powers \"are given by the constitution,\" \"they are limited and regulated by the [Judiciary Act of 1789], and by such other acts as have been passed on the subject.\" <i>Durousseau</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 6 Cranch 307, 314 (1810); see also <i>United States</i> v. <i>More,</i> 3 Cranch 159, 172-173 (1805). The Act does remove our authority to entertain an appeal or a petition for a writ of certiorari to review a decision of a court of appeals exercising its \"gatekeeping\" function over a second petition. But since it does not repeal our authority to entertain a petition for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*662</span> habeas corpus, there can be no plausible argument that the Act has deprived this Court of appellate jurisdiction in violation of Article III, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p>B</p>\n<p>We consider next how Title I affects the requirements a state prisoner must satisfy to show he is entitled to a writ of habeas corpus from this Court. Title I of the Act has changed the standards governing our consideration of habeas petitions by imposing new requirements for the granting of relief to state prisoners. Our authority to grant habeas relief to state prisoners is limited by \u00a7 2254, which specifies the conditions under which such relief may be granted to \"a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.\"<sup>[4]</sup> \u00a7 2254(a). Several sections of the Act impose new requirements for the granting of relief under this section, and they therefore inform our authority to grant such relief as well.</p>\n<p>Section 2244(b) addresses second or successive habeas petitions. Section 2244(b)(3)'s \"gatekeeping\" system for second petitions does not apply to our consideration of habeas petitions because it applies to applications \"filed in the district court.\" \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). There is no such limitation, however, on the restrictions on repetitive and new claims imposed by \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(1) and (2). These restrictions apply without qualification to any \"second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254.\" \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(1), (2). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*663</span> Whether or not we are bound by these restrictions, they certainly inform our consideration of original habeas petitions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Next, we consider whether the Act suspends the writ of habeas corpus in violation of Article I, \u00a7 9, clause 2, of the Constitution. This Clause provides that \"[t]he Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\"</p>\n<p>The writ of habeas corpus known to the Framers was quite different from that which exists today. As we explained previously, the first Congress made the writ of habeas corpus available only to prisoners confined under the authority of the United States, not under state authority. <i>Supra,</i> at 659\u0097 660; see <i>Ex parte Dorr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86308\"><a href=\"/opinion/86308/ex-parte-dorr/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span> (1844). The class of judicial actions reviewable by the writ was more restricted as well. In <i>Ex parte Watkins,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></span> (1830), we denied a petition for a writ of habeas corpus from a prisoner \"detained in prison by virtue of the judgment of a court, which court possesses general and final jurisdiction in criminal cases.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 202. Reviewing the English common law which informed American courts' understanding of the scope of the writ, we held that \"[t]he judgment of the circuit court in a criminal case is of itself evidence of its own legality,\" and that we could not \"usurp that power by the instrumentality of the writ of habeas corpus.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 207.</p>\n<p>It was not until 1867 that Congress made the writ generally available in \"all cases where any person may be restrained of his or her liberty in violation of the constitution, or of any treaty or law of the United States.\" <i>Supra,</i> at 659. And it was not until well into this century that this Court interpreted that provision to allow a final judgment of conviction in a state court to be collaterally attacked on habeas. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Waley</i> v. <i>Johnston,</i> 316 U. S. 101 (1942) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>Brown</i> v. <i>Allen,</i> 344 U. S. 443 (1953). But we assume, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*664</span> for purposes of decision here, that the Suspension Clause of the Constitution refers to the writ as it exists today, rather than as it existed in 1789. See <i>Swain</i> v. <i>Pressley,</i> 430 U. S. 372 (1977); <i>id.,</i> at 384 (Burger, C. J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>The Act requires a habeas petitioner to obtain leave from the court of appeals before filing a second habeas petition in the district court. But this requirement simply transfers from the district court to the court of appeals a screening function which would previously have been performed by the district court as required by 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254 Rule 9(b). The Act also codifies some of the pre-existing limits on successive petitions, and further restricts the availability of relief to habeas petitioners. But we have long recognized that \"the power to award the writ by any of the courts of the United States, must be given by written law,\" <i>Ex parte Bollman,</i> 4 Cranch 75, 94 (1807), and we have likewise recognized that judgments about the proper scope of the writ are \"normally for Congress to make.\" <i>Lonchar</i> v. <i>Thomas,</i> 517 U. S. 314, 323 (1996).</p>\n<p>The new restrictions on successive petitions constitute a modified res judicata rule, a restraint on what is called in habeas corpus practice \"abuse of the writ.\" In <i>McCleskey</i>  v. <i>Zant,</i> 499 U. S. 467 (1991), we said that \"the doctrine of abuse of the writ refers to a complex and evolving body of equitable principles informed and controlled by historical usage, statutory developments, and judicial decisions.\" <i>Id.,</i>  at 489. The added restrictions which the Act places on second habeas petitions are well within the compass of this evolutionary process, and we hold that they do not amount to a \"suspension\" of the writ contrary to Article I, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>We have answered the questions presented by the petition for certiorari in this case, and we now dispose of the petition <span class=\"star-pagination\">*665</span> for an original writ of habeas corpus. Our Rule 20.4(a) delineates the standards under which we grant such writs:</p>\n<p>\"A petition seeking the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus shall comply with the requirements of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241 and 2242, and in particular with the provision in the last paragraph of \u00a7 2242 requiring a statement of the `reasons for not making application to the district court of the district in which the applicant is held.' If the relief sought is from the judgment of a state court, the petition shall set forth specifically how and wherein the petitioner has exhausted available remedies in the state courts or otherwise comes within the provisions of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254(b). To justify the granting of a writ of habeas corpus, the petitioner must show exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of the Court's discretionary powers and must show that adequate relief cannot be obtained in any other form or from any other court. These writs are rarely granted.\"</p>\n<p>Reviewing petitioner's claims here, they do not materially differ from numerous other claims made by successive habeas petitioners which we have had occasion to review on stay applications to this Court. Neither of them satisfies the requirements of the relevant provisions of the Act, let alone the requirement that there be \"exceptional circumstances\" justifying the issuance of the writ.</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>The petition for writ of certiorari is dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The petition for an original writ of habeas corpus is denied.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i>  Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter and Justice Breyer join, concurring.</p>\n<p>While I join the Court's opinion, I believe its response to the argument that the Act has deprived this Court of appellate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*666</span> jurisdiction in violation of Article III, \u00a7 2, is incomplete. I therefore add this brief comment.</p>\n<p>As the Court correctly concludes, the Act does not divest this Court of jurisdiction to grant petitioner relief by issuing a writ of habeas corpus. It does, however, except the category of orders entered by the courts of appeals pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. II) from this Court's statutory jurisdiction to review cases in the courts of appeals pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1254(1). The Act does not purport to limit our jurisdiction under that section to review interlocutory orders in such cases, to limit our jurisdiction under \u00a7 1254(2), or to limit our jurisdiction under the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1651.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, there are at least three reasons for rejecting petitioner's argument that the limited exception violates Article III, \u00a7 2. First, if we retain jurisdiction to review the gatekeeping orders pursuant to the All Writs Act\u0097and petitioner has not suggested otherwise\u0097such orders are not immune from direct review. Second, by entering an appropriate interlocutory order, a court of appeals may provide this Court with an opportunity to review its proposed disposition of a motion for leave to file a second or successive habeas application. Third, in the exercise of our habeas corpus jurisdiction, we may consider earlier gatekeeping orders entered by the court of appeals to inform our judgments and provide the parties with the functional equivalent of direct review. In this case the Court correctly denies the writ of habeas corpus because petitioner's claims do not satisfy the requirements of our pre-Act jurisprudence or the requirements of the Act, including the standards governing the court of appeals' gatekeeping function.</p>\n<p>Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer join, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the Court's opinion. The Court holds today that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1217, precludes our review, by \"certiorari\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*667</span> or by \"appeal,\" over the courts of appeals's \"gatekeeper\" determinations. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E) (1994 ed., Supp. II). The statute's text does not necessarily foreclose all of our appellate jurisdiction, see, <i>e. g.,</i> 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1254(2) (certified questions from courts of appeals); \u00a7 1651(a) (authority to issue appropriate writs in aid of another exercise of appellate jurisdiction); this Court's Rule 20.3 (procedure for petitions for extraordinary writs), nor has Congress repealed our authority to entertain original petitions for writs of habeas corpus.<sup>[1]</sup> Because petitioner sought only a writ of certiorari (which Congress has foreclosed) and a writ of habeas corpus (which, even applying the traditional criteria, we would choose to deny, see <i>ante,</i> at 664-665), I have no difficulty with the conclusion that the statute is not on its face, or as applied here, unconstitutional. I write only to add that if it should later turn out that statutory avenues other than certiorari for reviewing a gatekeeping determination were closed, the question whether the statute exceeded Congress's Exceptions Clause power would be open.<sup>[2]</sup> The question could arise if the courts of appeals adopted divergent interpretations of the gatekeeper standard.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging affirmance were filed for the Washington Legal Foundation et al. by <i>Ronald D.

If an application is made to or transferred to the district court and denied, renewal of the application before a circuit judge shall not be permitted.

While he was awaiting execution, the  President signed into law the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty  Act of 1996 (Act), Title I of which, as here pertinent,  requires dismissal of a claim presented in a state prisoner's second or successive federal habeas application if the claim was also presented in  a prior application, Section(s) 106(b)(1); compels dismissal of a claim  that was not presented in a prior federal application, unless certain  conditions apply, Section(s) 106(b)(2); creates a \"gatekeeping\"  mechanism, whereby the prospective applicant files in the court of  appeals a motion for leave to file a second or successive habeas  application in the district court, and a three-judge panel determines  whether the application makes a prima facie showing that it satisfies Section(s) 106(b)'s requirements, Section(s) 106(b)(3); and declares  that a panel's grant or denial of authorization to file ``shall not be  appealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for . . . writ of  certiorari,'' Section(s) 106(b)(3)(E). Petitioner filed a motion for  leave to file a second federal habeas petition, which the Eleventh  Circuit denied on the grounds, <i>inter alia</i>, that the claims to be raised   therein had not been presented in his first petition and did not  meet Section(s) 106(b)(2)'s conditions.  Petitioner then filed in this Court  a pleading styled a \"Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus [and] for  Appellate or Certiorari Review . . . .\"  The Court granted certiorari,  ordering briefing on the extent to which Title I's provisions apply to a  habeas petition filed in this Court, whether application of the Act  suspended habeas in this case, and whether Title I, especially  Section(s) 106(b)(3)(E), unconstitutionally restricts the Court's jurisdiction.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Held</i>:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  The Act does not preclude this Court from entertaining an application for habeas corpus relief, although it does affect the standards governing the granting of such relief.  Pp. 5-10.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Title I does not deprive this Court of jurisdiction to entertain  habeas petitions filed as original matters pursuant to 28 U. S. C.  Section(s) 2241 and 2254.  No Title I provision mentions the Court's  authority to entertain such original petitions; in contrast, Section(s)  103 amends the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure to bar consideration  of original habeas petitions in the courts of appeals.  Although  Section(s) 106(b)(3)(E) precludes the Court from reviewing, by appeal or certiorari, the latter courts' decisions exercising the \"gatekeeping\"  function for second habeas petitions, it makes no mention of the Court's  original habeas jurisdiction.  Thus, the Court declines to find a repeal  of Section(s) 2241 by implication.  See <i>Ex parte</i> <i>Yerger</i>, 8 Wall. 85,  105.  This conclusion obviates any claim by petitioner under the Constitution's Exceptions Clause, Art. III, Section(s) 2, which provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that, \"[i]n all . . . Cases . . . the Supreme  Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with  such Exceptions . . . as the Congress shall make.\" Since the Act does  not repeal the Court's authority to entertain a habeas petition, there  can be no plausible argument  that it deprives the Court of appellate  jurisdiction in violation of that Clause.  Pp. 6-9.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Title I changes the standards governing this Court's consideration  of habeas petitions by imposing new requirements under 28 U. S. C.  Section(s) 2254(a), which limits the Court's authority to grant relief  to state prisoners.  Section 106(b)(3)'s \"gatekeeping\" system does not  apply to the Court because it is limited to applications \"filed in the  district court.\"  There is no such limitation, however, on the restrictions imposed by Section(s) 106(b)(1) and (2), and those restrictions inform the Court's authority to grant relief on original  habeas petitions, whether or not the Court is bound by the restrictions.  Pp. 9-10.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  The Act does not violate the Constitution's Suspension Clause, Art.  I, Section(s) 9, cl. 2, which provides that \"[t]he Privilege of the Writ  of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended.\" The new restrictions on  successive habeas petitions constitute a modified res judicata rule, a  restraint on what is called in habeas practice \"abuse of the writ.\"  The  doctrine of abuse of the writ refers to a complex and evolving body of  equitable principles informed and controlled by historical usage,  statutory developments, and judicial decisions.  <i>McCleskey</i> v. <i>Zant</i>, 499  U. S. 467, 489.  The new restrictions are well within  the compass of this evolutionary process and do not amount to a  \"suspension\" of the  writ. Pp. 10-12.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.  The petition for an original writ of habeas corpus is denied.  Petitioner's claims do not satisfy the Section(s) 106(b)(2)  requirements, let alone this Court's Rule 20.4(a), which requires that  the habeas petitioner show \"exceptional circumstances\" justifying the  issuance of the writ and says that habeas relief is rarely granted.  Petitioner's claims here do not materially differ from numerous other  claims made by successive habeas petitioners that the Court has had  occasion to review on stay applications.

We hold that the Act  does not preclude this Court from entertaining an application for habeas  corpus relief, although it does affect the standards governing the  granting of such relief. We also conclude that the availability of such  relief in this Court obviates any claim by petitioner under the  Exceptions Clause of Article III, Section(s) 2, of the Constitution, and  that the operative provisions of the Act do not violate the Suspension  Clause of the Constitution, Art.

Petitioner forcibly subdued her, raped  her, and sodomized her.  Jane pleaded with petitioner to let her go, but  he said he could not because she would notify the police.

The last  time Joy was seen alive was the evening of the next day.  Her dead body  was discovered two weeks later in a creek.  Forensic analysis  established that she  had been beaten, raped, and sodomized, and that she  had been strangled to death before being left in the creek.  Investigators discovered hair resembling petitioner's on Joy's body and  clothes, hair resembling Joy's in petitioner's bedroom, and clothing  fibers like those in Joy's coat in the hatchback of petitioner's car.

A three-judge panel has 30 days to  determine whether \"the application makes a prima facie showing that the application satisfies the requirements of\" Section(s) 106(b). 106(b)(3)(E) specifies that \"[t]he grant or denial of an authorization  by a court of appeals to file a second or successive application shall  not be appealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for  rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\" On May 2, 1996, petitioner filed  in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit a motion  for stay of execution and a motion for leave to file a second or successive federal habeas corpus petition under Section(s) 2254. Petitioner sought to raise two claims in his second petition, the first  being that the state trial court violated due process by equating guilt  \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" with \"moral certainty\" of guilt in voir dire  and jury instructions.

He  also alleged that qualified experts, reviewing the forensic evidence  after his conviction, had established that Joy must have died during a  period when petitioner was under police surveillance for Joy's  disappearance and thus had a valid alibi.  He claimed that the testimony  of the State's forensic expert at trial was suspect because he is not a licensed physician, and that the new expert  testimony so discredited the  State's testimony at trial that petitioner had a colorable claim of  factual innocence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court of Appeals denied both motions the day they were filed, concluding that petitioner's claims had not been presented in his  first habeas petition, that they did not meet the standards of  Section(s) 106(b)(2) of the Act, and that they would not have satisfied  pre-Act standards for obtaining review  on the merits of second or  successive claims.  83 F. 3d 1303 (CA11 1996).  Petitioner filed in this  Court a pleading styled a \"Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, for  Appellate or Certiorari Review of the Decision of the United States  Circuit Court for the Eleventh Circuit, and for Stay of Execution.\"  On  May 3, we granted petitioner's stay application and petition for certiorari.  We ordered briefing on the extent to which the provisions  of Title I of the Act apply to a petition for habeas corpus filed in  this Court, whether application of the Act suspended the writ of habeas  corpus in this case, and whether Title I of the Act, especially  Section(s) 106(b)(3)(E), constitutes an unconstitutional restriction on  the jurisdiction of this Court.  517 U.

S. C. Section(s) 2241 and 2254.  We  conclude that although the Act does impose new conditions on our  authority to grant relief, it  does not deprive this Court of  jurisdiction to entertain original habeas petitions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 106(b)(3)(E) of the Act prevents this Court from reviewing a court of appeals order denying leave to file a second habeas  petition by appeal or by writ of certiorari.  More than a century ago,  we considered whether a statute barring review by appeal of the judgment  of a circuit court in a habeas case also deprived this Court of power to  entertain an original habeas petition.  <i>Ex parte</i> <i>Yerger</i>, 8 Wall. 85   (1869).  We consider the same question here with respect to Section(s)  106(b)(3)(E).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Yerger</i>'s holding is best understood in the light of the availability of habeas corpus review at that time.  Section 14 of the  Judiciary Act of 1789 authorized all federal courts, including this  Court, to grant the writ of habeas corpus, when prisoners were \"in  custody, under or by colour of the authority of the United States, or   [were] committed for trial before some court of the same.\"  Act of Sept.  24, 1789, ch. 20, Section(s) 14, 1 Stat. 82.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Congress greatly  expanded the scope of federal habeas corpus in 1867, authorizing federal  courts to grant the writ, \"in addition to the authority already  conferred  by law,\" \"in all cases where any person may be restrained of  his or her liberty in violation of the constitution, or of any treaty or  law of the United States.\"  Act of Feb. 5, 1867, ch. 28, 14 Stat. 385.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Before the Act of 1867, the only instances in which a federal  court could issue the writ to produce a state prisoner were if the  prisoner was \"necessary to be brought into  court to testify,\" Act of  Sept. 24, 1789, ch. 20, Section(s) 14, 1 Stat. 82, was \"committed . . .  for any act done . . . in pursuance of a law of the United States,\" Act  of Mar. 2, 1833, ch. 57, Section(s) 7, 4 Stat. 634-635, or was a  \"subjec[t] or citize[n] of a foreign State, and domiciled therein,\" and  held under state law, Act of Aug. 29, 1842, ch. 257, 5 Stat. 539-540.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act of 1867 also expanded our statutory appellate jurisdiction to authorize appeals to this Court from the final decision  of any circuit court on a habeas petition.  14 Stat. 386.  This  enactment changed the result of <i>Barry</i> v. <i>Mercein</i>, 5 How. 103 (1847), in  which we had held that the Judiciary Act of 1789 did not authorize this  Court to conduct appellate review of circuit court habeas decisions.  However, in 1868, Congress revoked the appellate jurisdiction it had  given in 1867, repealing \"so much of the [Act of 1867] as authorizes an  appeal from the judgment of the circuit court to the Supreme Court of the United States.\"  Act of Mar. 27, 1868, ch. 34, Section(s) 2, 15  Stat. 44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Yerger</i>, we considered whether the Act of 1868 deprived us not  only of power to hear an appeal from a inferior court's decision on a  habeas petition, but also of power to entertain a habeas petition to  this Court under Section(s) 14 of the Act of 1789.  We concluded that  the 1868 Act did not affect our power to entertain such habeas  petitions.  We explained that the 1868 Act's text addressed only  jurisdiction over appeals conferred under the Act of 1867, not habeas  jurisdiction conferred under the Acts of 1789 and 1867.  We rejected the  suggestion that the Act of 1867 had repealed our habeas power by  implication. <i>Yerger</i>, 8 Wall., at 105. Repeals by implication are not favored, we said, and the continued exercise of original habeas jurisdiction was not \"repugnant\" to a prohibition on review by appeal of  circuit court habeas judgments. <i>Ibid</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the present case, we conclude that Title I of the Act  has not repealed our authority to entertain original habeas petitions,  for reasons similar to those stated in <i>Yerger</i>.  No provision of Title I  mentions our authority to entertain original habeas petitions; in  contrast, Section(s) 103 amends the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure  to bar consideration of original habeas petitions in the courts of  appeals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Although Section(s) 106(b) (3)(E) precludes us from  reviewing, by appeal  or petition for certiorari, a judgment on an  application for leave to file a second habeas petition in district  court, it makes no mention of our authority to hear habeas petitions  filed as original matters in this Court.  As we declined to find a  repeal of Section(s) 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 as applied to this  Court by implication then, we decline to find a similar  repeal of Section(s) 2241 of Title 28-its descendant, n. 1, <i>supra</i>-by implication  now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion obviates one of the constitutional challenges raised. The critical language of Article III, Section(s) 2, of the  Constitution provides that, apart from several classes of cases  specifically enumerated in this Court's original jurisdiction, \"[i]n all  the other Cases . . . the supreme Court shall have appellate  Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under  such Regulations as the Congress shall make.\"  Previous decisions  construing this clause have said that while our appellate powers \"are  given by the constitution,\" \"they are limited and regulated by the   [Judiciary Act of 1789], and by such other acts as have been passed on  the subject.\"  <i>Durousseau</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 6 Cranch 307, 314 (1810); see also <i>United States</i> v. <i>More</i>, 3 Cranch 159, 172-173 (1805).  The Act  does remove our authority to entertain  an appeal or a petition for a  writ of certiorari to review a decision of a court of appeals exercising  its \"gatekeeping\" function over a second petition.  But since it does  not repeal our authority to entertain a petition for habeas corpus,  there can be no plausible argument that the Act has deprived this Court  of appellate jurisdiction in violation of Article III, Section(s) 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider next how Title I affects the requirements a state prisoner must satisfy to show he is entitled to a writ of  habeas corpus  from this Court.  Title I of the Act has changed the standards governing  our consideration of habeas petitions by imposing new requirements for  the granting of relief to state prisoners.  Our authority to grant  habeas relief to state prisoners is limited by Section(s) 2254, which  specifies the conditions under which such relief may be granted to \"a  person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>   Section(s) 2254(a). Several sections of the Act impose new requirements  for the granting of relief under this section, and  they therefore inform  our authority to grant such relief as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 106(b) of the Act addresses second or successive habeas  petitions.  Section 106(b)(3)'s \"gatekeeping\" system for second  petitions does not apply to our consideration of habeas petitions  because it applies to applications \"filed in the district court.\"  Section(s) 106(b)(3)(A).  There is no such limitation, however, on the  restrictions on repetitive and new claims imposed by subsections  106(b)(1) and (2).  These restrictions apply without qualification to  any \"second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254.\" Section(s) 106(b)(1), (2).  Whether or not we are bound by these restrictions, they certainly inform our consideration of original habeas  petitions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we consider whether the Act suspends the writ of habeas corpus in violation of Article I, Section(s) 9, clause 2, of the Constitution.  This clause provides that \"[t]he Privilege of the Writ of  Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion  or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\" The writ of habeas corpus  known to the Framers was quite different from that which exists today.  As we explained previously, the first Congress made the writ of habeas  corpus available only to prisoners confined under the authority of the United States, not under state authority.  <i>Supra</i>, at 6-7; see <i>Ex parte</i>  <i>Dorr</i>, 3 How. 103 (1844).  The class of judicial actions reviewable by  the writ was more restricted as well.  In <i>Ex parte</i> <i>Watkins</i>, 3 Pet. 193   (1830), we denied a petition for a writ of habeas corpus from a prisoner  \"detained in prison by virtue of the judgment of a court, which court  possesses general and final jurisdiction in criminal cases.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at  202.  Reviewing the English common law which informed American courts'  understanding of the scope of the writ, we held that \"[t]he judgment of  the circuit court in a criminal case is of itself evidence of its own legality,\" and that we could not \"usurp that power by the instrumentality of the writ of habeas corpus.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 207.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was not until 1867 that Congress made the writ generally available in \"all cases where any person may be restrained of his or her  liberty in violation of the constitution, or of any treaty or law of the  United States.\"  <i>Supra</i>, at 6.  And it was not until well into this  century that this Court interpreted that provision to allow a final  judgment of conviction in a state court to be collaterally attacked on  habeas.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Waley</i> v. <i>Johnston</i>, 316 U. S. 101 (1942); <i>Brown</i> v.  <i>Allen</i>, 344 U.  S. 443 (1953).  But we assume, for purposes of decision  here, that the Suspension Clause of the Constitution refers to the writ  as it exists today, rather than as it existed in 1789.  See <i>Swain</i> v.  <i>Pressley</i>, 430 U. S. 372 (1977); <i>id.,</i> at 385 (Burger, C. J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act requires a habeas petitioner to obtain leave from the court of appeals before filing a second habeas petition in the district  court. But this requirement simply transfers from the district court to  the court of appeals a screening function which would previously have  been performed by the district court as required by 28 U. S. C.  Section(s) 2254 Rule 9(b).  The Act also codifies some of the  pre-existing limits on successive petitions, and further restricts the  availability of relief to habeas petitioners.  But we have long  recognized that \"the power to award the writ by any of the courts of the  United States, must be given by written law,\" <i>Ex parte</i> <i>Bollman</i>, 4 Cranch  75, 94 (1807), and we have likewise recognized that judgments about the proper scope of the writ are \"normally for Congress to make.\" <i>Lonchar</i>  v. <i>Thomas</i>, 517 U. S. ___, ___ (slip op., at 8).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The new restrictions on successive petitions constitute a modified res judicata rule, a restraint on what is called in habeas  corpus practice \"abuse of the writ.\"  In <i>McCleskey</i> v. <i>Zant</i>, 499 U. S.  467 (1991), we said that \"the doctrine of abuse of the writ refers to a  complex and evolving body of equitable principles informed and  controlled by historical usage, statutory developments, and judicial  decisions.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 489.   The added restrictions which the Act places  on second habeas petitions are well within the compass of this  evolutionary process, and we hold that they do not amount to a  \"suspension\" of the writ contrary to Article I, Section(s) 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have answered the questions presented by the petition for certiorari in this case, and we now dispose of the petition for an original writ of habeas corpus.  Our Rule 20.4(a) delineates  the standards under which we grant such writs:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A petition seeking the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus shall comply with the requirements of 28 U. S. C. Section(s) 2241 and  2242, and in particular with the provision in the last paragraph of  Section(s) 2242 requiring a statement of the `reasons for not making  application to the district court of the district in which the applicant  is held.'  If the relief sought is from the judgment of a state court,  the petition shall set forth specifically how and wherein the petitioner  has exhausted available remedies in the state courts or otherwise comes  within the provisions of 28 U. S. C. Section(s) 2254(b).  To justify the granting of a writ of habeas corpus, the petitioner must show exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of the Court's discretionary powers and must show that adequate relief cannot be obtained in any other form or from any other court.  These writs are  rarely granted.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reviewing petitioner's claims here, they do not materially differ from numerous other claims made by successive habeas petitioners  which we have had occasion to review on stay applications to this Court.  Neither of them satisfies the requirements of the relevant provisions  of the Act, let alone the requirement that there be \"exceptional  circumstances\" justifying the issuance of the writ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for writ of certiorari is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.  The petition for an original writ of habeas corpus is  denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter and Justice Breyer join, concurring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While I join the Court's opinion, I believe its response to the  argument that the Act has deprived this Court of appellate jurisdiction  in violation of Article III, Section(s) 2, is incomplete.  I therefore  add this brief comment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Court correctly concludes, the Act does not divest this  Court of jurisdiction to grant petitioner relief by issuing a writ of  habeas corpus.  It does, however, except the category of orders entered  by the courts of appeals pursuant to Section(s) 106(b)(3) from this  Court's statutory jurisdiction to review cases in the courts of appeals  pursuant to 28 U. S. C. Section(s) 1254(1).  The Act does not purport to  limit our jurisdiction under that section to review interlocutory orders  in such cases, to limit our jurisdiction under Section(s) 1254(2), or to  limit our jurisdiction under the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. Section(s) 1651.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, there are at least three reasons for rejecting petitioner's argument that the limited exception violates Article III,  Section(s) 2.  First, if we retain jurisdiction to review the  gatekeeping orders pursuant to the All Writs Act-and petitioner has not  suggested otherwise-such orders are not immune from direct review.  Second, by entering an appropriate interlocutory order, a court of  appeals may provide this Court with an opportunity to review its  proposed disposition of a motion for leave to file a second or  successive habeas application.  Third, in the exercise of our habeas  corpus jurisdiction, we may consider earlier gatekeeping orders entered by the court of appeals to inform our judgments and provide the parties  with the functional equivalent of direct review.  In this case the Court  correctly denies the writ of habeas corpus because petitioner's claims  do not satisfy the requirements of our pre-Act jurisprudence or the  requirements of the Act, including the standards governing the court of  appeals' gatekeeping function.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer join, concurring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I join the Court's opinion.  The Court holds today that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1217, precludes our review, by \"certiorari\" or by  \"appeal,\" over the Courts of Appeals's \"gatekeeper\" determinations.  See  provision to be codified at 28 U. S. C. Section(s) 2244(b)(3)(E).  The  statute's text does not necessarily foreclose all of our appellate  jurisdiction, see, <i>e.g.</i>, 28 U. S. C. Section(s) 1254(2) (certified  questions from courts of appeals); Section(s) 1651(a) (authority to  issue appropriate writs in aid of another exercise of appellate jurisdiction); this Court's Rule 20.3 (procedure for petitions for extraordinary writs), nor has Congress repealed our authority to entertain original petitions for writs of habeas corpus.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Because  petitioner sought only a writ of certiorari (which Congress has  foreclosed) and a writ of habeas corpus (which, even applying the  traditional criteria, we would choose  to deny, see <i>ante,</i> at 12), I have  no difficulty with the conclusion that the statute is not on its face,  or as applied here, unconstitutional. I write only to add that if it  should later turn out that statutory avenues other than certiorari for   reviewing a gatekeeping determination were closed, the question whether  the statute exceeded Congress's Exceptions Clause power  would be open.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The question could arise if the Courts of Appeals adopted divergent interpretations of the gatekeeper standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 14 is the direct ancestor of 28 U.

If an application is made to or transferred  to the district court and denied, renewal of the application before a  circuit judge shall not be permitted.
