The week before her SSDI award, she filed suit under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), contending that her former employer, respondent Policy Management Systems Corporation, had discriminated against her on account of her disability. In granting Policy Management Systems summary judgment, the District Court concluded that Cleveland's claim that she was totally disabled for SSDI purposes estopped her from proving an essential element of her ADA claim, namely, that she could \"perform the essential functions\" of her job, at least with \"reasonable   accommodation,\" 42 U.S. C. &#167;12111(8). The Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that the application for or receipt of SSDI benefits creates a rebuttable presumption that a recipient is estopped from pursuing an ADA claim and that Cleveland failed torebut the presumption.</p>\r\n      <p>Held:</p>\r\n      <p>1.  Pursuit, and receipt, of SSDI benefits does not automatically estop a recipient from pursuing an ADA claim or erect a strong presumption against the recipient's ADA success. However, to survive a summary judgment motion, an ADA plaintiff cannot ignore her SSDI contention that she was too disabled to work, but must explain why that contention is consistent with her ADA claim that she can perform the essential functions of her job, at least with reasonable accommodation. Pp. 5 11.</p>\r\n      <p>(a)  Despite the appearance of conflict between the SSDI program (which provides benefits to a person with a disability so severe that she is unable to do her previous work or any other kind of substantial gainful work) and the ADA (which prohibits covered employers from discriminating against a disabled person who can perform the essential functions of her job, including those who can do so only with reasonable accommodation), the two claims do not inherently conflict to the point where courts should apply a special negative presumption such as the one applied below. There are many situations in which an SSDI claim and an ADA claim can comfortably exist side by side. For example, since the Social Security Administration (SSA) does not take into account the possibility of \"reasonable accommodation\" in determining SSDI eligibility, an ADA plaintiff's claim that she can perform her job with reasonable accommodation may well prove consistent with an SSDI claim that she could not perform her own job (or other jobs) without it. An individual might qualify for SSDI under SSA's administrative rules and yet, due to special individual circumstances, be capable of performing the essential functions of her job. Or her condition might have changed over time, so that a statement about her disability made at the time of her application for SSDI benefits does not reflect her capacities at the time of the relevant employment decision. Thus, this Court would not apply a special legal presumption permitting someone who has applied for, or received, SSDI benefits to bring an ADA suit only in some limited and highly unusual set of circumstances. Pp. 5 10.</p>\r\n      <p>(b)  Nonetheless, in some cases an earlier SSDI claim may turn out genuinely to conflict with an ADA claim. Summary judgment for a defendant is appropriate when a plaintiff fails to make a sufficient showing to establish the existence of an essential element on which she has the burden of proof at trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322. An ADA plaintiff's sworn assertion in an application for disability benefits that she is unable to work appears to negate the essential element of her ADA claim that she can perform the essential functions of her job, and a court should require an explanation of this apparent inconsistency. To defeat summary judgment, that explanation must be sufficient to warrant a reasonable juror's concluding that, assuming the truth of, or the plaintiff's good faith belief in, the earlier statement, the plaintiff could nonetheless perform the essential functions of her job, with or without reasonable accommodation. Pp. 10 11.</p>\r\n      <p>2.  Here, the parties should have the opportunity in the trial court to present, or to contest, Cleveland's explanations for the discrepancy between her SSDI statements and her ADA claim, which include that the SSDI statements that she was totally disabled were made in a forum that does not consider the effect that reasonable workplace accommodation would have on her ability to work and that those statements were reliable at the time they were made.

This case asks whether the law erects a special presumption that would significantly inhibit an SSDI recipient from simultaneously pursuing an action for disability discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), claiming that \"with   reasonable accommodation\" she could \"perform the essential functions\" of her job. &#167;101, 104 Stat. 331, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(8).</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\r\n      <p>We believe that, in context, these two seemingly divergent statutory contentions are often consistent, each with the other. Thus pursuit, and receipt, of SSDI benefits does not automatically estop the recipient from pursuing an ADA claim. Nor does the law erect a strong presumption against the recipient's success under the ADA. Nonetheless, an ADA plaintiff cannot simply ignore her SSDI contention that she was too disabled to work. To survive a defendant's motion for summary judgment, she must explain why that SSDI contention is consistent with her ADA claim that she could \"perform the essential functions\" of her previous job, at least with \"reasonable accommodation.\"</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\r\n      <p>* After suffering a disabling stroke and losing her job, Carolyn Cleveland sought and obtained SSDI benefits from the Social Security Administration (SSA). She has also brought this ADA suit in which she claims that her former employer, Policy Management Systems Corporation, discriminated against her on account of her disability. The two claims developed in the following way:</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\r\n      <p>August 1993: Cleveland began work at Policy Management Systems.

She reported that fact to the SSA two weeks later.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\r\n      <p>July 11, 1994: Noting that Cleveland had returned to work, the SSA denied her SSDI application.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\r\n      <p>July 15, 1994: Policy Management Systems fired Cleveland.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\r\n      <p>September 14, 1994: Cleveland asked the SSA to reconsider its July 11th SSDI denial. In doing so, she said, \"I was terminated [by Policy Management Systems] due to my condition and I have not been able to work since. I continue to be disabled.\" Id., at 46. She later added that she had \"attempted to return to work in mid April,\" that she had \"worked for three months,\" and that Policy Management Systems terminated her because she \"could no longer do the job\" in light of her \"condition.\" Id., at 47.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\r\n      <p>November 1994: The SSA denied Cleveland's request for reconsideration. Cleveland sought an SSA hearing, reiterating that \"I am unable to work due to my disability,\" and presenting new evidence about the extent of her injuries. Id., at 79.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\r\n      <p>September 29, 1995: The SSA awarded Cleveland SSDI benefits retroactive to the day of her stroke, January 7, 1994.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\r\n      <p>On September 22, 1995, the week before her SSDI award, Cleveland brought this ADA lawsuit. She contended that Policy Management Systems had \"terminat[ed]\" her employment without reasonably \"accommodat[ing] her disability.\" Id., at 7. She alleged that she requested, but was denied, accommodations such as training and additional time to complete her work. Id., at 96. And she submitted a supporting affidavit from her treating physician. Id., at 101. The District Court did not evaluate her reasonable accommodation claim on the merits, but granted summary judgment to the defendant because, in that court's view, Cleveland, by applying for and receiving SSDI benefits, had conceded that she was totally disabled. And that fact, the court concluded, now estopped Cleveland from proving an essential element of her ADA claim, namely that she could \"perform the essential functions\" of her job, at least with \"reasonable accommodation.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(8).</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\r\n      <p>The Fifth Circuit affirmed the District Court's grant of summary judgment. 120 F.3d 513 (1997). The court wrote:</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\r\n      <p>\"[T]he application for or the receipt of social security disability benefits creates a rebuttable presumption that the claimant or recipient of such benefits is judicially estopped from asserting that he is a 'qualified individual with a disability.' \" Id., at 518.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\r\n      <p>The Circuit Court noted that it was \"at least theoretically conceivable that under some limited and highly unusual set of circumstances the two claims would not necessarily be mutually exclusive.\" Id., at 517. But it concluded that, because</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\r\n      <p>\"Cleveland consistently represented to the SSA that she was totally disabled, she has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact rebutting the presumption that she is judicially estopped from now asserting that for the time in question she was nevertheless a 'qualified individual with a disability' for purposes of her ADA claim.\" Id., at 518 519.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\r\n      <p>We granted certiorari in light of disagreement among the Circuits about the legal effect upon an ADA suit of the application for, or receipt of, disability benefits. Compare, e.g., Rascon v. U S West Communications, Inc., 143 F.3d 1324, 1332 (CA10 1998) (application for, and receipt of, SSDI benefits is relevant to, but does not estop plaintiff from bringing, an ADA claim); Griffith v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 135 F.3d 376, 382 (CA6 1998) (same), cert. pending, No. 97 1991; Swanks v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, 116 F.3d 582, 586 (CADC 1997) (same), with McNemar v. Disney Store, Inc., 91 F.3d 610, 618 620 (CA3 1996) (applying judicial estoppel to bar plaintiff who applied for disability benefits from bringing suit under the ADA), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1115 (1997), and Kennedy v. Applause, Inc., 90 F.3d 1477, 1481 1482 (CA9 1996) (declining to apply judicial estoppel but holding that claimant who declared total disability in a benefits application failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she was a qualified individual with a disability).</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <p>II</p>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\r\n      <p>The Social Security Act and the ADA both help individuals with disabilities, but in different ways. The Social Security Act provides monetary benefits to every insured individual who \"is under a disability.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 423(a)(1). The Act defines \"disability\" as an</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\r\n      <p>\"inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any   physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\" &#167;423(d)(1)(A).</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\r\n      <p>The individual's impairment, as we have said, supra, at 1, must be</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\r\n      <p>\"of such severity that [she] is not only unable to do [her] previous work but cannot, considering [her] age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy   .\" &#167;423(d)(2)(A).</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\r\n      <p>The ADA seeks to eliminate unwarranted discrimination against disabled individuals in order both to guarantee those individuals equal opportunity and to provide the Nation with the benefit of their consequently increased productivity. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101(a)(8),(9). The Act prohibits covered employers from discriminating \"against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual.\" &#167;12112(a). The Act defines a \"qualified individual with a disability\" as a disabled person \"who   can perform the essential functions\" of her job, including those who can do so only \"with   reasonable accommodation.\" &#167;12111(8).</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\r\n      <p>We here consider but one of the many ways in which these two statutes might interact. This case does not involve, for example, the interaction of either of the statutes before us with other statutes, such as the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U.S.C. &#167; 51 et seq. Nor does it involve directly conflicting statements about purely factual matters, such as \"The light was red/green,\" or \"I can/cannot raise my arm above my head.\" An SSA representation of total disability differs from a purely factual statement in that it often implies a context-related legal conclusion, namely \"I am disabled for purposes of the Social Security Act.\" And our consideration of this latter kind of statement consequently leaves the law related to the former, purely factual, kind of conflict where we found it.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\r\n      <p>The case before us concerns an ADA plaintiff who both applied for, and received, SSDI benefits. It requires us to review a Court of Appeals decision upholding the grant of summary judgment on the ground that an ADA plaintiff 's \"represent[ation] to the SSA that she was totally disabled\" created a \"rebuttable presumption\" sufficient to \"judicially esto[p]\" her later representation that, \"for the time in question,\" with reasonable accommodation, she could perform the essential functions of her job. 120 F.3d, at 518 519. The Court of Appeals thought, in essence, that claims under both Acts would incorporate two directly conflicting propositions, namely \"I am too disabled to work\" and \"I am not too disabled to work.\" And in an effort to prevent two claims that would embody that kind of factual conflict, the court used a special judicial presumption, which it believed would ordinarily prevent a plaintiff like Cleveland from successfully asserting an ADA claim.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\r\n      <p>In our view, however, despite the appearance of conflict that arises from the language of the two statutes, the two claims do not inherently conflict to the point where courts should apply a special negative presumption like the one applied by the Court of Appeals here. That is because there are too many situations in which an SSDI claim and an ADA claim can comfortably exist side by side.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\r\n      <p>For one thing, as we have noted, the ADA defines a \"qualified individual\" to include a disabled person \"who   can perform the essential functions\" of her job \"with reasonable accommodation.\" Reasonable accommodations may include:</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\r\n      <p>\"job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(9)(B).</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\r\n      <p>By way of contrast, when the SSA determines whether an individual is disabled for SSDI purposes, it does not take the possibility of \"reasonable accommodation\" into account, nor need an applicant refer to the possibility of reasonable accommodation when she applies for SSDI. See Memorandum from Daniel L. Skoler, Associate Comm'r for Hearings and Appeals, SSA, to Administrative Appeals Judges, reprinted in 2 Social Security Practice Guide, App. &#167;15C[9], pp. 15 401 to 15 402 (1998). The omission reflects the facts that the SSA receives more than 2.5 million claims for disability benefits each year; its administrative resources are limited; the matter of \"reasonable accommodation\" may turn on highly disputed workplace-specific matters; and an SSA misjudgment about that detailed, and often fact-specific matter would deprive a seriously disabled person of the critical financial support the statute seeks to provide. See Brief for United States et al. as Amici Curiae 10 11, and n. 2, 13. The result is that an ADA suit claiming that the plaintiff can perform her job with reasonable accommodation may well prove consistent with an SSDI claim that the plaintiff could not perform her own job (or other jobs) without it.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\r\n      <p>For another thing, in order to process the large number of SSDI claims, the SSA administers SSDI with the help of a five-step procedure that embodies a set of presumptions about disabilities, job availability, and their interrelation. The SSA asks:</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\r\n      <p>Step One: Are you presently working? (If so, you are ineligible.) See 20 CFR &#167; 404.1520(b) (1998).</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\r\n      <p>Step Two: Do you have a \"severe impairment,\" i.e., one that \"significantly limits\" your ability to do basic work activities? (If not, you are ineligible.) See &#167;404.1520(c).</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\r\n      <p>Step Three: Does your impairment \"mee[t] or equa[l]\" an impairment on a specific (and fairly lengthy) SSA list? (If so, you are eligible without more.) See &#167;&#167;404.1520(d), 404.1525, 404.1526.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\r\n      <p>Step Four: If your impairment does not meet or equal a listed impairment, can you perform your \"past relevant work?\" (If so, you are ineligible.) See &#167;404.1520(e).</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\r\n      <p>Step Five: If your impairment does not meet or equal a listed impairment and you cannot perform your \"past relevant work,\" then can you perform other jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy? (If not, you are eligible.) See &#167;&#167;404.1520(f ), 404.1560(c).</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\r\n      <p>The presumptions embodied in these questions particularly those necessary to produce Step Three's list, which, the Government tells us, accounts for approximately 60 percent of all awards, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 20 grow out of the need to administer a large benefits system efficiently. But they inevitably simplify, eliminating consideration of many differences potentially relevant to an individual's ability to perform a particular job. Hence, an individual might qualify for SSDI under the SSA's administrative rules and yet, due to special individual circumstances, remain capable of \"perform[ing] the essential functions\" of her job.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\r\n      <p>Further, the SSA sometimes grants SSDI benefits to individuals who not only can work, but are working. For example, to facilitate a disabled person's reentry into the workforce, the SSA authorizes a 9-month trial-work period during which SSDI recipients may receive full benefits. See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 422(c), 423(e)(1); 20 CFR &#167; 404.1592 (1998). See also &#167;404.1592a (benefits available for an additional 15-month period depending upon earnings). Improvement in a totally disabled person's physical condition, while permitting that person to work, will not necessarily or immediately lead the SSA to terminate SSDI benefits. And the nature of an individual's disability may change over time, so that a statement about that disability at the time of an individual's application for SSDI benefits may not reflect an individual's capacities at the time of the relevant employment decision.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\r\n      <p>Finally, if an individual has merely applied for, but has not been awarded, SSDI benefits, any inconsistency in the theory of the claims is of the sort normally tolerated by our legal system. Our ordinary rules recognize that a person may not be sure in advance upon which legal theory she will succeed, and so permit parties to \"set forth two or more statements of a claim or defense alternately or hypothetically,\" and to \"state as many separate claims or defenses as the party has regardless of consistency.\" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(e)(2). We do not see why the law in respect to the assertion of SSDI and ADA claims should differ. (And, as we said, we leave the law in respect to purely factual contradictions where we found it.)</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\r\n      <p>In light of these examples, we would not apply a special legal presumption permitting someone who has applied for, or received, SSDI benefits to bring an ADA suit only in \"some limited and highly unusual set of circumstances.\" 120 F.3d, at 517.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\r\n      <p>Nonetheless, in some cases an earlier SSDI claim may turn out genuinely to conflict with an ADA claim. Summary judgment for a defendant is appropriate when the plaintiff \"fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to [her] case, and on which [she] will bear the burden of proof at trial.\" Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). An ADA plaintiff bears the burden of proving that she is a \"qualified individual with a disability\" that is, a person \"who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions\" of her job. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(8). And a plaintiff 's sworn assertion in an application for disability benefits that she is, for example, \"unable to work\" will appear to negate an essential element of her ADA case at least if she does not offer a sufficient explanation. For that reason, we hold that an ADA plaintiff cannot simply ignore the apparent contradiction that arises out of the earlier SSDI total disability claim. Rather, she must proffer a sufficient explanation.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\r\n      <p>The lower courts, in somewhat comparable circumstances, have found a similar need for explanation. They have held with virtual unanimity that a party cannot create a genuine issue of fact sufficient to survive summary judgment simply by contradicting his or her own previous sworn statement (by, say, filing a later affidavit that flatly contradicts that party's earlier sworn deposition) without explaining the contradiction or attempting to resolve the disparity. See, e.g., Colantuoni v. Alfred Calcagni &amp; Sons, Inc., 44 F.3d 1, 5 (CA1 1994); Rule v. Brine, Inc., 85 F.3d 1002, 1011 (CA2 1996); Hackman v. Valley Fair, 932 F.2d 239, 241 (CA3 1991); Barwick v. Celotex Corp., 736 F.2d 946, 960 (CA4 1984); Albertson v. T. J. Stevenson &amp; Co., 749 F.2d 223, 228 (CA5 1984); Davidson &amp; Jones Development Co. v. Elmore Development Co., 921 F.2d 1343, 1352 (CA6 1991); Slowiak v. Land O'Lakes, Inc., 987 F.2d 1293, 1297 (CA7 1993); Camfield Tires, Inc. v. Michelin Tire Corp., 719 F.2d 1361, 1365 1366 (CA8 1983); Kennedy v. Allied Mutual Ins.

Although these cases for the most part involve purely factual contradictions (as to which we do not necessarily endorse these cases, but leave the law as we found it), we believe that a similar insistence upon explanation is warranted here, where the conflict involves a legal conclusion. When faced with a plaintiff 's previous sworn statement asserting \"total disability\" or the like, the court should require an explanation of any apparent inconsistency with the necessary elements of an ADA claim. To defeat summary judgment, that explanation must be sufficient to warrant a reasonable juror's concluding that, assuming the truth of, or the plaintiff 's good faith belief in, the earlier statement, the plaintiff could nonetheless \"perform the essential functions\" of her job, with or without \"reasonable accommodation.\"</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <p>III</p>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\r\n      <p>In her brief in this Court, Cleveland explains the discrepancy between her SSDI statements that she was \"totally disabled\" and her ADA claim that she could \"perform the essential functions\" of her job. The first statements, she says, \"were made in a forum which does not consider the effect that reasonable workplace accommodations would have on the ability to work.\" Brief for Petitioner 43. Moreover, she claims the SSDI statements were \"accurate statements\" if examined \"in the time period in which they were made.\" Ibid.

Coal Lands Act of 1909 (1909 Act), 35 Stat. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*868</span> 844, 30 U. S. C. § 81; Coal Lands Act of 1910 (1910 Act), ch. 318, 36 Stat. 583, 30 U. S. C. §§ 83-85. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit determined that the reservation of \"coal\" includes gas found within the coal formation, commonly referred to as coalbed methane gas (CBM gas). See 151 F. 3d 1251, 1256 (1998) (en banc). We granted certiorari, 525 U. S. 1118 (1999), and now reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>During the second half of the 19th century, Congress sought to encourage the settlement of the West by providing land in fee simple absolute to homesteaders who entered and cultivated tracts of a designated size for a period of years. See, <i>e. g.,</i> 1862 Homestead Act, 12 Stat. 392; 1877 Desert Land Act, ch. 107, 19 Stat. 377, as amended, 43 U. S. C. §§ 321-323. Public lands classified as valuable for coal were exempted from entry under the general land-grant statutes and instead were made available for purchase under the 1864 Coal Lands Act, ch. 205, § 1, 13 Stat. 343, and the 1873 Coal Lands Act, ch. 279, § 1, 17 Stat. 607, which set a maximum limit of 160 acres on individual entry and minimum prices of $10 to $20 an acre. Lands purchased under these early Coal Lands Acts  like lands patented under the Homestead Acts  were conveyed to the entry man in fee simple absolute, with no reservation of any part of the coal or mineral estate to the United States. The coal mined from the lands purchased under the Coal Lands Acts and from other reserves fueled the Industrial Revolution.</p>\n<p>At the turn of the 20th century, however, a coal famine struck the West. See Hearings on Coal Lands and CoalLand Laws of the United States before the House Committee on Public Lands, 59th Cong., 2d Sess., 11-13 (1906) (testimony of Edgar E. Clark, Interstate Commerce Commissioner). At the same time, evidence of widespread fraud in the administration of federal coal lands came to light. Lacking the resources to make an independent assessment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*869</span> of the coal content of each individual land tract, the Department of the Interior in classifying public lands had relied for the most part on the affidavits of entrymen. <i>Watt</i>  v. <i>Western Nuclear, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 36, 48, and n. 9 (1983). Railroads and other coal interests had exploited the system to avoid paying for coal lands and to evade acreage restrictions by convincing individuals to falsify affidavits, acquire lands for homesteading, and then turn the land over to them. C. Mayer &amp; G. Riley, Public Domain, Private Dominion 117  118 (1985).</p>\n<p>In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt responded to the perceived crisis by withdrawing 64 million acres of public land thought to contain coal from disposition under the public land laws. <i>Western Nuclear,</i> 462 U. S., at 48-49. As a result, even homesteaders who had entered and worked the land in good faith lost the opportunity to make it their own unless they could prove to the land office that the land was not valuable for coal.</p>\n<p>President Roosevelt's order outraged homesteaders and western interests, and Congress struggled for the next three years to construct a compromise that would reconcile the competing interests of protecting settlers and managing federal coal lands for the public good. President Roosevelt and others urged Congress to begin issuing limited patents that would sever the surface and mineral estates and allow for separate disposal of each. See <i>id.,</i> at 49 (quoting Special Message to Congress, Jan. 22, 1909, 15 Messages and Papers of the Presidents 7266). Although various bills were introduced in Congress that would have severed the estates  some of which would have reserved \"natural gas\" as well as \"coal\" to the United States  none was enacted. See 41 Cong. Rec. 630 (1907) (bill by Rep. Volstead \"reserving coal, lignite, petroleum, and natural-gas deposits from disposal . . . under existing land laws\"); <i>id.,</i> at 1483-1484 (bill by Sen. La Follette providing for the sale of surface lands, but \"reserving from entry and sale the mineral rights to coal and other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*870</span> materials mined for fuel, oil, gas, or asphalt\"); <i>id.,</i> at 1788 (bill by Sen. Nelson \"to provide for the reservation of the coal, lignite, oil, and natural gas in the public lands\").</p>\n<p>Finally, Congress passed the 1909 Act, which authorized the Federal Government, for the first time, to issue limited land patents. In contrast to the broad reservations of mineral rights proposed in the failed bills, however, the 1909 Act provided for only a narrow reservation. The 1909 Act authorized issuance of patents to individuals who had already made good-faith agricultural entries onto tracts later identified as coal lands, but the issuance was to be subject to \"a reservation to the United States of all coal in said lands, and the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the same.\" 30 U. S. C. § 81. The 1909 Act also permitted the patentee to \"mine coal for use on the land for domestic purposes prior to the disposal by the United States of the coal deposit.\" <i>Ibid.</i> A similar Act in 1910 opened the remaining coal lands to new entry under the homestead laws, subject to the same reservation of coal to the United States. 30 U. S. C. §§ 83-85.</p>\n<p>Among the lands patented to settlers under the 1909 and 1910 Acts were former reservation lands of the Southern Ute Indian Tribe, which the Tribe had ceded to the United States in 1880 in return for certain allotted lands provided for their settlement. Act of June 15, 1880, ch. 223, 21 Stat. 199. In 1938, the United States restored to the Tribe, in trust, title to the ceded reservation lands still owned by the United States, including the reserved coal in lands patented under the 1909 and 1910 Acts. As a result, the Tribe now has equitable title to the coal in lands within its reservation settled by homesteaders under the 1909 and 1910 Acts.</p>\n<p>We are advised that over 20 million acres of land were patented under the 1909 and 1910 Acts and that the lands  including those lands in which the Tribe owns the coal  contain large quantities of CBM gas. Brief for Montana et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 2. At the time the Acts were passed, CBM <span class=\"star-pagination\">*871</span> gas had long been considered a dangerous waste product of coal mining. By the 1970's, however, it was apparent that CBM gas could be a significant energy resource, see Duel &amp; Kimm, Coalbed Gas: A Source of Natural Gas, Oil &amp; Gas J., June 16, 1975, p. 47, and, in the shadow of the Arab oil embargo, the Federal Government began to encourage the immediate production of CBM gas through grants, see 42 U. S. C. §§ 5901-5915 (1994 ed. and Supp. III), and substantial tax credits, see 26 U. S. C. § 29 (1994 ed. and Supp. III).</p>\n<p>Commercial development of CBM gas was hampered, however, by uncertainty over its ownership. \"In order to expedite the development of this energy source,\" the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior issued a 1981 opinion concluding that the reservation of coal to the United States in the 1909 and 1910 Acts did not encompass CBM gas. See <i>Ownership of and Right to Extract Coalbed Gas in Federal Coal Deposits,</i> 88 I. D. 538, 539. In reliance on the Solicitor's 1981 opinion, oil and gas companies entered into leases to produce CBM gas with individual landowners holding title under 1909 and 1910 Act patents to some 200,000 acres in which the Tribe owns the coal.</p>\n<p>In 1991, the Tribe brought suit in Federal District Court against petitioners, the royalty owners and producers under the oil and gas leases covering that land, and the federal agencies and officials responsible for the administration of lands held in trust for the Tribe. The Tribe sought, <i>inter alia,</i> a declaration that Congress' reservation of coal in the 1909 and 1910 Acts extended to CBM gas, so that the Tribe  not the successors in interest of the land patentees  owned the CBM gas.</p>\n<p>The District Court granted summary judgment for the defendants, holding that the plain meaning of \"coal\" is the \"solid rock substance\" used as fuel, which does not include CBM gas. 874 F. Supp. 1142, 1154 (Colo. 1995). On appeal, a panel of the Court of Appeals reversed. 119 F. 3d 816, 819 (CA10 1997). The court then granted rehearing en banc <span class=\"star-pagination\">*872</span> on the question whether the term \"coal\" in the 1909 and 1910 Acts \"unambiguously excludes or includes CBM.\" 151 F. 3d, at 1256. Over a dissenting opinion by Judge Tacha, joined by two other judges, the en banc court agreed with the panel. <i>Ibid.</i> The court held that the term \"coal\" was ambiguous. <i>Ibid.</i> It invoked the interpretive canon that ambiguities in land grants should be resolved in favor of the sovereign and concluded that the coal reservation encompassed CBM gas. <i>Ibid.</i> </p>\n<p>The United States did not petition for, or participate in, the rehearing en banc. Instead, it filed a supplemental brief explaining that the Solicitor of the Interior was reconsidering the 1981 Solicitor's opinion in light of the panel's decision. Brief for Federal Respondents 14, n. 8. On the day the federal respondents' response to petitioners' certiorari petition was due, see <i>id.,</i> at 47, n. 37, the Solicitor of the Interior withdrew the 1981 opinion in a one-line order, see Addendum to Brief for Federal Respondents in Opposition 1a. The federal respondents now support the Tribe's position that CBM gas is coal reserved by the 1909 and 1910 Acts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We begin our discussion as the parties did, with a brief overview of the chemistry and composition of coal. Coal is a heterogeneous, noncrystalline sedimentary rock composed primarily of carbonaceous materials. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Gorbaty &amp; Larsen, Coal Structure and Reactivity, in 3 Encyclopedia of Physical Science and Technology 437 (R. Meyers ed. 2d ed. 1992). It is formed over millions of years from decaying plant material that settles on the bottom of swamps and is converted by microbiological processes into peat. D. Van Krevelen, Coal 90 (3d ed. 1993). Over time, the resulting peat beds are buried by sedimentary deposits. <i>Id.,</i> at 91. As the beds sink deeper and deeper into the earth's crust, the peat is transformed by chemical reactions which increase the carbon content of the fossilized plant material. <i>Ibid.</i>  <span class=\"star-pagination\">*873</span> The process in which peat transforms into coal is referred to as coalification. <i>Ibid.</i> </p>\n<p>The coalification process generates methane and other gases. R. Rogers, Coalbed Methane: Principles and Practice 148 (1994). Because coal is porous, some of that gas is retained in the coal. CBM gas exists in the coal in three basic states: as free gas; as gas dissolved in the water in coal; and as gas \"adsorped\" on the solid surface of the coal, that is, held to the surface by weak forces called van der Waals forces. <i>Id.,</i> at 16-17, 117. These are the same three states or conditions in which gas is stored in other rock formations. Because of the large surface area of coal pores, however, a much higher proportion of the gas is adsorped on the surface of coal than is adsorped in other rock. <i>Id.,</i> at 16-17. When pressure on the coalbed is decreased, the gas in the coal formation escapes. As a result, CBM gas is released from coal as the coal is mined and brought to the surface.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>While the modern science of coal provides a useful backdrop for our discussion and is consistent with our ultimate disposition, it does not answer the question presented to us. The question is not whether, given what scientists know today, it makes sense to regard CBM gas as a constituent of coal but whether Congress so regarded it in 1909 and 1910. In interpreting statutory mineral reservations like the one at issue here, we have emphasized that Congress \"was dealing with a practical subject in a practical way\" and that it intended the terms of the reservation to be understood in \"their ordinary and popular sense.\" <i>Burke</i> v. <i>Southern Pacific R. Co.,</i> 234 U. S. 669, 679 (1914) (rejecting \"scientific test\" for determining whether a reservation of \"mineral lands\" included \"petroleum lands\"); see also <i>Perrin</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979) (\"[U]nless otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning\" at the time <span class=\"star-pagination\">*874</span> Congress enacted the statute). We are persuaded that the common conception of coal at the time Congress passed the 1909 and 1910 Acts was the solid rock substance that was the country's primary energy resource.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>At the time the Acts were passed, most dictionaries defined coal as the solid fuel resource. For example, one contemporary dictionary defined coal as a \"solid and more or less distinctly stratified mineral, varying in color from darkbrown to black, brittle, combustible, and used as fuel, not fusible without decomposition and very insoluble.\" 2 Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia 1067 (1906). See also American Dictionary of the English Language 244 (N. Webster 1889) (defining \"coal\" as a \"black, or brownish black, solid, combustible substance, consisting, like charcoal, mainly of carbon, but more compact\"); 2 New English Dictionary on Historical Principles 549 (J. Murray ed. 1893) (defining coal as a \"mineral, solid, hard, opaque, black, or blackish, found in seams or strata in the earth, and largely used as fuel\"); Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language 424 (W. Harris &amp; F. Allen eds. 1916) (defining coal as a \"black, or brownish black, solid, combustible mineral substance\").</p>\n<p>In contrast, dictionaries of the day defined CBM gas  then called \"marsh gas,\" \"methane,\" or \"fire-damp\"  as a distinct substance, a gas \"contained in\" or \"given off by\" coal, but not as coal itself. See, <i>e. g.,</i> 3 Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia 2229 (1906) (defining \"fire-damp\" as \"[t]he gas contained in coal, often given off by it in large quantities, and exploding, on ignition, when mixed with atmospheric air\"; noting that \"[f]ire-damp is a source of great danger to life in coal-mines\").</p>\n<p>As these dictionary definitions suggest, the common understanding of coal in 1909 and 1910 would not have encompassed CBM gas, both because it is a gas rather than a solid <span class=\"star-pagination\">*875</span> mineral and because it was understood as a distinct substance that escaped from coal as the coal was mined, rather than as a part of the coal itself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>As a practical matter, moreover, it is clear that, by reserving coal in the 1909 and 1910 Act patents, Congress intended to reserve only the solid rock fuel that was mined, shipped throughout the country, and then burned to power the Nation's railroads, ships, and factories. Cf. <i>Leo Sheep Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 440 U. S. 668, 682 (1979) (public land statutes should be interpreted in light of \"the condition of the country when the acts were passed\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). In contrast to natural gas, which was not yet an important source of fuel at the turn of the century, coal was the primary energy for the Industrial Revolution. See, <i>e. g.,</i> D. Yergin, The Prize 543 (1991). See also Brief for Federal Respondents 30 (recognizing that the three primary sources of energy in the United States at the turn of the century were coal, oil, and wood, and that natural gas  even from conventional reservoirs  was not yet an important energy resource).</p>\n<p>As the history recounted in Part I, <i>supra,</i> establishes, Congress passed the 1909 and 1910 Acts to address concerns over the short supply, mismanagement, and fraudulent acquisition of this solid rock fuel resource. Rejecting broader proposals, Congress chose a narrow reservation of the resource that would address the exigencies of the crisis at hand without unduly burdening the rights of homesteaders or impeding the settlement of the West.</p>\n<p>It is evident that Congress viewed CBM gas not as part of the solid fuel resource it was attempting to conserve and manage but as a dangerous waste product, which escaped from coal as the coal was mined. Congress was well aware by 1909 that the natural gas found in coal formations was released during coal mining and posed a serious threat to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*876</span> mine safety. Explosions in coal mines sparked by CBM gas occurred with distressing frequency in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Brief for National Mining Association as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 7. Congress was also well aware that the CBM gas needed to be vented to the greatest extent possible. Almost 20 years prior to the passage of the 1909 and 1910 Acts, Congress had enacted the first federal coalmine-safety law which, among other provisions, prescribed specific ventilation standards for coal mines of a certain depth \"so as to dilute and render harmless . . . the noxious or poisonous gases.\" 1891 Territorial Mine Inspection Act, § 6, 26 Stat. 1105. See also 3 Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia, <i>supra,</i> at 2229 (explaining the dangers associated with fire-damp).</p>\n<p>That CBM gas was considered a dangerous waste product which escaped from coal, rather than part of the valuable coal fuel itself, is also confirmed by the fact that coal companies venting the gas to prevent its accumulation in the mines made no attempt to capture or preserve it. The more gas that escaped from the coal once it was brought to the surface, the better it was for the mining companies because it decreased the risk of a dangerous gas buildup during transport and storage. Cf. E. Moore, Coal: Its Properties, Analysis, Classification, Geology, Extraction, Uses and Distribution 308 (1922) (noting that the presence of gases such as methane in the coal increases the risk of spontaneous combustion of the coal during storage).</p>\n<p>(The fact that CBM gas was known to escape naturally from coal distinguishes it from the \"producer gas\" that was generated from coal in the 1800's. Brief for Federal Respondents 30. Producer gas was produced by \"destructive distillation, that is, by heating the coal to a temperature where it decomposed chemically.\" App. 531 (reproducing Perry, The Gasification of Coal, Scientific American 230, (Mar. 1974)). The natural escape of CBM gas from the coal also distinguishes CBM gas from other \"volatile matter,\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*877</span> expelled when coal is heated, or liquid \"coal extracts,\" which \"can be extracted through the use of appropriate solvents.\" Brief for Federal Respondents 26-27. The federal respondents' expressed concern that if the coal reservation does not encompass CBM gas it does not encompass these \"components\" of coal, see <i>ibid.,</i> is unfounded.)</p>\n<p>There is some evidence of limited and sporadic exploitation of CBM gas as a fuel prior to the passage of the 1909 and 1910 Acts. See, <i>e. g.,</i> E. Craig &amp; M. Myers, Ownership of Methane Gas in Coalbeds, 24 Rocky Mt. Min. L. Inst. 767, 768 (1978) (\"As early as 1746, methane was being drained from an English coal mine through pipes and used for heating\"); see also <i>United States Steel Corp.</i> v. <i>Hoge,</i> 503 Pa. 140, 146, 468 A. 2d 1380, 1383 (1983) (noting that as early as 1900, \"certain wells were drilled [into coalbeds in Pennsylvania, which] produced coalbed gas\"). It seems unlikely, though, that Congress considered this limited drilling for CBM gas. To the extent Congress had an awareness of it, there is every reason to think it viewed the extraction of CBM gas as drilling for natural gas, not mining coal.</p>\n<p>That distinction is significant because the question before us is not whether Congress would have thought that CBM gas had some fuel value, but whether Congress considered it part of the coal fuel. When it enacted the 1909 and 1910 Acts, Congress did not reserve all minerals or energy resources in the lands. It reserved only coal, and then only in lands that were specifically identified as valuable for coal. It chose not to reserve oil, natural gas, or any other known or potential energy resources.</p>\n<p>The limited nature of the 1909 and 1910 Act reservations is confirmed by subsequent congressional enactments. When Congress wanted to reserve gas rights that might yield valuable fuel, it did so in explicit terms. In 1912, for example, Congress enacted a statute that reserved \"oil and gas\" in Utah lands. Act of Aug. 24, 1912, 37 Stat. 496. In addition, both the 1912 Act and a later Act passed in 1914 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*878</span> continued the tradition begun in the 1909 and 1910 Acts of reserving only those minerals enumerated in the statute. See <i>ibid.;</i> Act of July 17, 1914, 38 Stat. 509, as amended, 30 U. S. C. §§ 121-123 (providing that \"[l]ands withdrawn or classified as phosphate, nitrate, potash, oil, gas, or asphaltic minerals, or which are valuable for those deposits,\" could be patented, subject to a reservation to the United States of \"the deposits on account of which the lands so patented were withdrawn or classified or reported as valuable\"). It was not until 1916 that Congress passed a public lands Act containing a general reservation of valuable minerals in the lands. See Stock-Raising Homestead Act, ch. 9, 39 Stat. 862, as amended, 43 U. S. C. § 299 (reserving \"all the coal and other minerals in the lands\" in all lands patented under the Act). See also <i>Western Nuclear,</i> 462 U. S., at 49 (\"Unlike the preceding statutes containing mineral reservations, the [1916 Stock-Raising Homestead Act] was not limited to lands classified as mineral in character, and it did not reserve only specifically identified minerals\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Respondents contend that Congress did not reserve the solid coal but convey the CBM gas because the resulting split estate would be impractical and would make mining the coal difficult because the miners would have to capture and preserve the CBM gas that escaped during mining. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Brief for Respondent Southern Ute Indian Tribe 46; see also <i>id.,</i> at 25-26 (emphasizing that the reservation includes the right to \"mine\" the coal, indicating that \"Congress reserved all rights needed to develop the underlying coal\" including the right to vent CBM gas during mining). We doubt Congress would have given much consideration to these problems, however, because  as noted above  it does not appear to have given consideration to the possibility that CBM gas would one day be a profitable energy source developed on a large scale.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*879</span> It may be true, nonetheless, that the right to mine the coal implies the right to release gas incident to coal mining where it is necessary and reasonable to do so. The right to dissipate the CBM gas where reasonable and necessary to mine the coal does not, however, imply the ownership of the gas in the first instance. Rather, it simply reflects the established common-law right of the owner of one mineral estate to use, and even damage, a neighboring estate as necessary and reasonable to the extraction of his own minerals. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Williams</i> v. <i>Gibson,</i> 84 Ala. 228, 4 So. 350 (1888); Rocky Mountain Mineral Law Foundation, 6 American Law of Mining § 200.04 (2d ed. 1997). Given that split estates were already common at the time the 1909 and 1910 Acts were passed, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Chartiers Block Coal Co.</i> v. <i>Mellon,</i> 152 Pa. 286, 25 A. 597 (1893), and that the common law has proved adequate to the task of resolving the resulting conflicts between estates, there is no reason to think that the prospect of a split estate would have deterred Congress from reserving only the coal.</p>\n<p>Were a case to arise in which there are two commercially valuable estates and one is to be damaged in the course of extracting the other, a dispute might result, but it could be resolved in the ordinary course of negotiation or adjudication. That is not the issue before us, however. The question is one of ownership, not of damage or injury.</p>\n<p>In all events, even were we to construe the coal reservation to encompass CBM gas, a split estate would result. The United States concedes (and the Tribe does not dispute) that once the gas originating in the coal formation migrates to surrounding rock formations it belongs to the natural gas, rather than the coal, estate. See Brief for Federal Respondents 35; Brief for Respondent Southern Ute Indian Tribe 3, n. 4. Natural gas from other sources may also exist in the lands at issue. Including the CBM gas in the coal reservation would, therefore, create a split gas estate that would be at least as difficult to administer as a split <span class=\"star-pagination\">*880</span> coal/CBM gas estate. If CBM gas were reserved with the coal estate, those developing the natural gas resources in the land would have to allocate the gas between the natural gas and coal estates based on some assessment of how much had migrated outside the coal itself. There is no reason to think Congress would have been more concerned about the creation of a split coal/CBM gas estate than the creation of a split gas estate.</p>\n<p>Because we conclude that the most natural interpretation of \"coal\" as used in the 1909 and 1910 Acts does not encompass CBM gas, we need not consider the applicability of the canon that ambiguities in land grants are construed in favor of the sovereign or the competing canons relied on by petitioners.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i> </p>\n<p>Justice Breyer took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p>Justice Ginsburg, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I would affirm the judgment below substantially for the reasons stated by the Court of Appeals and the federal respondents. See 151 F. 3d 1251, 1256-1267 (CA10 1998) (en banc); Brief for Federal Respondents 14-16. As the Court recognizes, in 1909 and 1910 coalbed methane gas (CBM) was a liability. See <i>ante,</i> at 870-871, 875-876. Congress did not contemplate that the surface owner would be responsible for it. More likely, Congress would have assumed that the coal owner had dominion over, and attendant responsibility for, CBM. I do not find it clear that Congress understood dominion would shift if and when the liability became an asset. I would therefore apply the canon that ambiguities in land grants are construed in favor of the sovereign. See <i>Watt</i> v. <i>Western Nuclear, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 36, 59 (1983) (noting \"established rule that land grants are construed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*881</span> favorably to the Government, that nothing passes except what is conveyed in clear language, and that if there are doubts they are resolved for the Government, not against it\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for Campbell County, Wyoming, by <i>S.

Coal Lands Act of 1909 (1909 Act), 35 Stat. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*868</span> 844, 30 U. S. C. § 81; Coal Lands Act of 1910 (1910 Act), ch. 318, 36 Stat. 583, 30 U. S. C. §§ 83-85. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit determined that the reservation of \"coal\" includes gas found within the coal formation, commonly referred to as coalbed methane gas (CBM gas). See 151 F. 3d 1251, 1256 (1998) (en banc). We granted certiorari, 525 U. S. 1118 (1999), and now reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>During the second half of the 19th century, Congress sought to encourage the settlement of the West by providing land in fee simple absolute to homesteaders who entered and cultivated tracts of a designated size for a period of years. See, <i>e. g.,</i> 1862 Homestead Act, 12 Stat. 392; 1877 Desert Land Act, ch. 107, 19 Stat. 377, as amended, 43 U. S. C. §§ 321-323. Public lands classified as valuable for coal were exempted from entry under the general land-grant statutes and instead were made available for purchase under the 1864 Coal Lands Act, ch. 205, § 1, 13 Stat. 343, and the 1873 Coal Lands Act, ch. 279, § 1, 17 Stat. 607, which set a maximum limit of 160 acres on individual entry and minimum prices of $10 to $20 an acre. Lands purchased under these early Coal Lands Acts  like lands patented under the Homestead Acts  were conveyed to the entry man in fee simple absolute, with no reservation of any part of the coal or mineral estate to the United States. The coal mined from the lands purchased under the Coal Lands Acts and from other reserves fueled the Industrial Revolution.</p>\n<p>At the turn of the 20th century, however, a coal famine struck the West. See Hearings on Coal Lands and CoalLand Laws of the United States before the House Committee on Public Lands, 59th Cong., 2d Sess., 11-13 (1906) (testimony of Edgar E. Clark, Interstate Commerce Commissioner). At the same time, evidence of widespread fraud in the administration of federal coal lands came to light. Lacking the resources to make an independent assessment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*869</span> of the coal content of each individual land tract, the Department of the Interior in classifying public lands had relied for the most part on the affidavits of entrymen. <i>Watt</i>  v. <i>Western Nuclear, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 36, 48, and n. 9 (1983). Railroads and other coal interests had exploited the system to avoid paying for coal lands and to evade acreage restrictions by convincing individuals to falsify affidavits, acquire lands for homesteading, and then turn the land over to them. C. Mayer &amp; G. Riley, Public Domain, Private Dominion 117  118 (1985).</p>\n<p>In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt responded to the perceived crisis by withdrawing 64 million acres of public land thought to contain coal from disposition under the public land laws. <i>Western Nuclear,</i> 462 U. S., at 48-49. As a result, even homesteaders who had entered and worked the land in good faith lost the opportunity to make it their own unless they could prove to the land office that the land was not valuable for coal.</p>\n<p>President Roosevelt's order outraged homesteaders and western interests, and Congress struggled for the next three years to construct a compromise that would reconcile the competing interests of protecting settlers and managing federal coal lands for the public good. President Roosevelt and others urged Congress to begin issuing limited patents that would sever the surface and mineral estates and allow for separate disposal of each. See <i>id.,</i> at 49 (quoting Special Message to Congress, Jan. 22, 1909, 15 Messages and Papers of the Presidents 7266). Although various bills were introduced in Congress that would have severed the estates  some of which would have reserved \"natural gas\" as well as \"coal\" to the United States  none was enacted. See 41 Cong. Rec. 630 (1907) (bill by Rep. Volstead \"reserving coal, lignite, petroleum, and natural-gas deposits from disposal . . . under existing land laws\"); <i>id.,</i> at 1483-1484 (bill by Sen. La Follette providing for the sale of surface lands, but \"reserving from entry and sale the mineral rights to coal and other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*870</span> materials mined for fuel, oil, gas, or asphalt\"); <i>id.,</i> at 1788 (bill by Sen. Nelson \"to provide for the reservation of the coal, lignite, oil, and natural gas in the public lands\").</p>\n<p>Finally, Congress passed the 1909 Act, which authorized the Federal Government, for the first time, to issue limited land patents. In contrast to the broad reservations of mineral rights proposed in the failed bills, however, the 1909 Act provided for only a narrow reservation. The 1909 Act authorized issuance of patents to individuals who had already made good-faith agricultural entries onto tracts later identified as coal lands, but the issuance was to be subject to \"a reservation to the United States of all coal in said lands, and the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the same.\" 30 U. S. C. § 81. The 1909 Act also permitted the patentee to \"mine coal for use on the land for domestic purposes prior to the disposal by the United States of the coal deposit.\" <i>Ibid.</i> A similar Act in 1910 opened the remaining coal lands to new entry under the homestead laws, subject to the same reservation of coal to the United States. 30 U. S. C. §§ 83-85.</p>\n<p>Among the lands patented to settlers under the 1909 and 1910 Acts were former reservation lands of the Southern Ute Indian Tribe, which the Tribe had ceded to the United States in 1880 in return for certain allotted lands provided for their settlement. Act of June 15, 1880, ch. 223, 21 Stat. 199. In 1938, the United States restored to the Tribe, in trust, title to the ceded reservation lands still owned by the United States, including the reserved coal in lands patented under the 1909 and 1910 Acts. As a result, the Tribe now has equitable title to the coal in lands within its reservation settled by homesteaders under the 1909 and 1910 Acts.</p>\n<p>We are advised that over 20 million acres of land were patented under the 1909 and 1910 Acts and that the lands  including those lands in which the Tribe owns the coal  contain large quantities of CBM gas. Brief for Montana et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 2. At the time the Acts were passed, CBM <span class=\"star-pagination\">*871</span> gas had long been considered a dangerous waste product of coal mining. By the 1970's, however, it was apparent that CBM gas could be a significant energy resource, see Duel &amp; Kimm, Coalbed Gas: A Source of Natural Gas, Oil &amp; Gas J., June 16, 1975, p. 47, and, in the shadow of the Arab oil embargo, the Federal Government began to encourage the immediate production of CBM gas through grants, see 42 U. S. C. §§ 5901-5915 (1994 ed. and Supp. III), and substantial tax credits, see 26 U. S. C. § 29 (1994 ed. and Supp. III).</p>\n<p>Commercial development of CBM gas was hampered, however, by uncertainty over its ownership. \"In order to expedite the development of this energy source,\" the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior issued a 1981 opinion concluding that the reservation of coal to the United States in the 1909 and 1910 Acts did not encompass CBM gas. See <i>Ownership of and Right to Extract Coalbed Gas in Federal Coal Deposits,</i> 88 I. D. 538, 539. In reliance on the Solicitor's 1981 opinion, oil and gas companies entered into leases to produce CBM gas with individual landowners holding title under 1909 and 1910 Act patents to some 200,000 acres in which the Tribe owns the coal.</p>\n<p>In 1991, the Tribe brought suit in Federal District Court against petitioners, the royalty owners and producers under the oil and gas leases covering that land, and the federal agencies and officials responsible for the administration of lands held in trust for the Tribe. The Tribe sought, <i>inter alia,</i> a declaration that Congress' reservation of coal in the 1909 and 1910 Acts extended to CBM gas, so that the Tribe  not the successors in interest of the land patentees  owned the CBM gas.</p>\n<p>The District Court granted summary judgment for the defendants, holding that the plain meaning of \"coal\" is the \"solid rock substance\" used as fuel, which does not include CBM gas. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1142</span></span>, 1154 (Colo. 1995). On appeal, a panel of the Court of Appeals reversed. 119 F. 3d 816, 819 (CA10 1997). The court then granted rehearing en banc <span class=\"star-pagination\">*872</span> on the question whether the term \"coal\" in the 1909 and 1910 Acts \"unambiguously excludes or includes CBM.\" 151 F. 3d, at 1256. Over a dissenting opinion by Judge Tacha, joined by two other judges, the en banc court agreed with the panel. <i>Ibid.</i> The court held that the term \"coal\" was ambiguous. <i>Ibid.</i> It invoked the interpretive canon that ambiguities in land grants should be resolved in favor of the sovereign and concluded that the coal reservation encompassed CBM gas. <i>Ibid.</i> </p>\n<p>The United States did not petition for, or participate in, the rehearing en banc. Instead, it filed a supplemental brief explaining that the Solicitor of the Interior was reconsidering the 1981 Solicitor's opinion in light of the panel's decision. Brief for Federal Respondents 14, n. 8. On the day the federal respondents' response to petitioners' certiorari petition was due, see <i>id.,</i> at 47, n. 37, the Solicitor of the Interior withdrew the 1981 opinion in a one-line order, see Addendum to Brief for Federal Respondents in Opposition 1a. The federal respondents now support the Tribe's position that CBM gas is coal reserved by the 1909 and 1910 Acts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We begin our discussion as the parties did, with a brief overview of the chemistry and composition of coal. Coal is a heterogeneous, noncrystalline sedimentary rock composed primarily of carbonaceous materials. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Gorbaty &amp; Larsen, Coal Structure and Reactivity, in 3 Encyclopedia of Physical Science and Technology 437 (R. Meyers ed. 2d ed. 1992). It is formed over millions of years from decaying plant material that settles on the bottom of swamps and is converted by microbiological processes into peat. D. Van Krevelen, Coal 90 (3d ed. 1993). Over time, the resulting peat beds are buried by sedimentary deposits. <i>Id.,</i> at 91. As the beds sink deeper and deeper into the earth's crust, the peat is transformed by chemical reactions which increase the carbon content of the fossilized plant material. <i>Ibid.</i>  <span class=\"star-pagination\">*873</span> The process in which peat transforms into coal is referred to as coalification. <i>Ibid.</i> </p>\n<p>The coalification process generates methane and other gases. R. Rogers, Coalbed Methane: Principles and Practice 148 (1994). Because coal is porous, some of that gas is retained in the coal. CBM gas exists in the coal in three basic states: as free gas; as gas dissolved in the water in coal; and as gas \"adsorped\" on the solid surface of the coal, that is, held to the surface by weak forces called van der Waals forces. <i>Id.,</i> at 16-17, 117. These are the same three states or conditions in which gas is stored in other rock formations. Because of the large surface area of coal pores, however, a much higher proportion of the gas is adsorped on the surface of coal than is adsorped in other rock. <i>Id.,</i> at 16-17. When pressure on the coalbed is decreased, the gas in the coal formation escapes. As a result, CBM gas is released from coal as the coal is mined and brought to the surface.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>While the modern science of coal provides a useful backdrop for our discussion and is consistent with our ultimate disposition, it does not answer the question presented to us. The question is not whether, given what scientists know today, it makes sense to regard CBM gas as a constituent of coal but whether Congress so regarded it in 1909 and 1910. In interpreting statutory mineral reservations like the one at issue here, we have emphasized that Congress \"was dealing with a practical subject in a practical way\" and that it intended the terms of the reservation to be understood in \"their ordinary and popular sense.\" <i>Burke</i> v. <i>Southern Pacific R. Co.,</i> 234 U. S. 669, 679 (1914) (rejecting \"scientific test\" for determining whether a reservation of \"mineral lands\" included \"petroleum lands\"); see also <i>Perrin</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979) (\"[U]nless otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning\" at the time <span class=\"star-pagination\">*874</span> Congress enacted the statute). We are persuaded that the common conception of coal at the time Congress passed the 1909 and 1910 Acts was the solid rock substance that was the country's primary energy resource.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>At the time the Acts were passed, most dictionaries defined coal as the solid fuel resource. For example, one contemporary dictionary defined coal as a \"solid and more or less distinctly stratified mineral, varying in color from darkbrown to black, brittle, combustible, and used as fuel, not fusible without decomposition and very insoluble.\" 2 Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia 1067 (1906). See also American Dictionary of the English Language 244 (N. Webster 1889) (defining \"coal\" as a \"black, or brownish black, solid, combustible substance, consisting, like charcoal, mainly of carbon, but more compact\"); 2 New English Dictionary on Historical Principles 549 (J. Murray ed. 1893) (defining coal as a \"mineral, solid, hard, opaque, black, or blackish, found in seams or strata in the earth, and largely used as fuel\"); Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language 424 (W. Harris &amp; F. Allen eds. 1916) (defining coal as a \"black, or brownish black, solid, combustible mineral substance\").</p>\n<p>In contrast, dictionaries of the day defined CBM gas  then called \"marsh gas,\" \"methane,\" or \"fire-damp\"  as a distinct substance, a gas \"contained in\" or \"given off by\" coal, but not as coal itself. See, <i>e. g.,</i> 3 Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia 2229 (1906) (defining \"fire-damp\" as \"[t]he gas contained in coal, often given off by it in large quantities, and exploding, on ignition, when mixed with atmospheric air\"; noting that \"[f]ire-damp is a source of great danger to life in coal-mines\").</p>\n<p>As these dictionary definitions suggest, the common understanding of coal in 1909 and 1910 would not have encompassed CBM gas, both because it is a gas rather than a solid <span class=\"star-pagination\">*875</span> mineral and because it was understood as a distinct substance that escaped from coal as the coal was mined, rather than as a part of the coal itself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>As a practical matter, moreover, it is clear that, by reserving coal in the 1909 and 1910 Act patents, Congress intended to reserve only the solid rock fuel that was mined, shipped throughout the country, and then burned to power the Nation's railroads, ships, and factories. Cf. <i>Leo Sheep Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 440 U. S. 668, 682 (1979) (public land statutes should be interpreted in light of \"the condition of the country when the acts were passed\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). In contrast to natural gas, which was not yet an important source of fuel at the turn of the century, coal was the primary energy for the Industrial Revolution. See, <i>e. g.,</i> D. Yergin, The Prize 543 (1991). See also Brief for Federal Respondents 30 (recognizing that the three primary sources of energy in the United States at the turn of the century were coal, oil, and wood, and that natural gas  even from conventional reservoirs  was not yet an important energy resource).</p>\n<p>As the history recounted in Part I, <i>supra,</i> establishes, Congress passed the 1909 and 1910 Acts to address concerns over the short supply, mismanagement, and fraudulent acquisition of this solid rock fuel resource. Rejecting broader proposals, Congress chose a narrow reservation of the resource that would address the exigencies of the crisis at hand without unduly burdening the rights of homesteaders or impeding the settlement of the West.</p>\n<p>It is evident that Congress viewed CBM gas not as part of the solid fuel resource it was attempting to conserve and manage but as a dangerous waste product, which escaped from coal as the coal was mined. Congress was well aware by 1909 that the natural gas found in coal formations was released during coal mining and posed a serious threat to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*876</span> mine safety. Explosions in coal mines sparked by CBM gas occurred with distressing frequency in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Brief for National Mining Association as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 7. Congress was also well aware that the CBM gas needed to be vented to the greatest extent possible. Almost 20 years prior to the passage of the 1909 and 1910 Acts, Congress had enacted the first federal coalmine-safety law which, among other provisions, prescribed specific ventilation standards for coal mines of a certain depth \"so as to dilute and render harmless . . . the noxious or poisonous gases.\" 1891 Territorial Mine Inspection Act, § 6, 26 Stat. 1105. See also 3 Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia, <i>supra,</i> at 2229 (explaining the dangers associated with fire-damp).</p>\n<p>That CBM gas was considered a dangerous waste product which escaped from coal, rather than part of the valuable coal fuel itself, is also confirmed by the fact that coal companies venting the gas to prevent its accumulation in the mines made no attempt to capture or preserve it. The more gas that escaped from the coal once it was brought to the surface, the better it was for the mining companies because it decreased the risk of a dangerous gas buildup during transport and storage. Cf. E. Moore, Coal: Its Properties, Analysis, Classification, Geology, Extraction, Uses and Distribution 308 (1922) (noting that the presence of gases such as methane in the coal increases the risk of spontaneous combustion of the coal during storage).</p>\n<p>(The fact that CBM gas was known to escape naturally from coal distinguishes it from the \"producer gas\" that was generated from coal in the 1800's. Brief for Federal Respondents 30. Producer gas was produced by \"destructive distillation, that is, by heating the coal to a temperature where it decomposed chemically.\" App. 531 (reproducing Perry, The Gasification of Coal, Scientific American 230, (Mar. 1974)). The natural escape of CBM gas from the coal also distinguishes CBM gas from other \"volatile matter,\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*877</span> expelled when coal is heated, or liquid \"coal extracts,\" which \"can be extracted through the use of appropriate solvents.\" Brief for Federal Respondents 26-27. The federal respondents' expressed concern that if the coal reservation does not encompass CBM gas it does not encompass these \"components\" of coal, see <i>ibid.,</i> is unfounded.)</p>\n<p>There is some evidence of limited and sporadic exploitation of CBM gas as a fuel prior to the passage of the 1909 and 1910 Acts. See, <i>e. g.,</i> E. Craig &amp; M. Myers, Ownership of Methane Gas in Coalbeds, 24 Rocky Mt. Min. L. Inst. 767, 768 (1978) (\"As early as 1746, methane was being drained from an English coal mine through pipes and used for heating\"); see also <i>United States Steel Corp.</i> v. <i>Hoge,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2275047\"><a href=\"/opinion/2275047/united-states-steel-corp-v-hoge/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span>, 146, 468 A. 2d 1380, 1383 (1983) (noting that as early as 1900, \"certain wells were drilled [into coalbeds in Pennsylvania, which] produced coalbed gas\"). It seems unlikely, though, that Congress considered this limited drilling for CBM gas. To the extent Congress had an awareness of it, there is every reason to think it viewed the extraction of CBM gas as drilling for natural gas, not mining coal.</p>\n<p>That distinction is significant because the question before us is not whether Congress would have thought that CBM gas had some fuel value, but whether Congress considered it part of the coal fuel. When it enacted the 1909 and 1910 Acts, Congress did not reserve all minerals or energy resources in the lands. It reserved only coal, and then only in lands that were specifically identified as valuable for coal. It chose not to reserve oil, natural gas, or any other known or potential energy resources.</p>\n<p>The limited nature of the 1909 and 1910 Act reservations is confirmed by subsequent congressional enactments. When Congress wanted to reserve gas rights that might yield valuable fuel, it did so in explicit terms. In 1912, for example, Congress enacted a statute that reserved \"oil and gas\" in Utah lands. Act of Aug. 24, 1912, 37 Stat. 496. In addition, both the 1912 Act and a later Act passed in 1914 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*878</span> continued the tradition begun in the 1909 and 1910 Acts of reserving only those minerals enumerated in the statute. See <i>ibid.;</i> Act of July 17, 1914, 38 Stat. 509, as amended, 30 U. S. C. §§ 121-123 (providing that \"[l]ands withdrawn or classified as phosphate, nitrate, potash, oil, gas, or asphaltic minerals, or which are valuable for those deposits,\" could be patented, subject to a reservation to the United States of \"the deposits on account of which the lands so patented were withdrawn or classified or reported as valuable\"). It was not until 1916 that Congress passed a public lands Act containing a general reservation of valuable minerals in the lands. See Stock-Raising Homestead Act, ch. 9, 39 Stat. 862, as amended, 43 U. S. C. § 299 (reserving \"all the coal and other minerals in the lands\" in all lands patented under the Act). See also <i>Western Nuclear,</i> 462 U. S., at 49 (\"Unlike the preceding statutes containing mineral reservations, the [1916 Stock-Raising Homestead Act] was not limited to lands classified as mineral in character, and it did not reserve only specifically identified minerals\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Respondents contend that Congress did not reserve the solid coal but convey the CBM gas because the resulting split estate would be impractical and would make mining the coal difficult because the miners would have to capture and preserve the CBM gas that escaped during mining. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Brief for Respondent Southern Ute Indian Tribe 46; see also <i>id.,</i> at 25-26 (emphasizing that the reservation includes the right to \"mine\" the coal, indicating that \"Congress reserved all rights needed to develop the underlying coal\" including the right to vent CBM gas during mining). We doubt Congress would have given much consideration to these problems, however, because  as noted above  it does not appear to have given consideration to the possibility that CBM gas would one day be a profitable energy source developed on a large scale.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*879</span> It may be true, nonetheless, that the right to mine the coal implies the right to release gas incident to coal mining where it is necessary and reasonable to do so. The right to dissipate the CBM gas where reasonable and necessary to mine the coal does not, however, imply the ownership of the gas in the first instance. Rather, it simply reflects the established common-law right of the owner of one mineral estate to use, and even damage, a neighboring estate as necessary and reasonable to the extraction of his own minerals. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Williams</i> v. <i>Gibson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ala.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So.</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></span> (1888); Rocky Mountain Mineral Law Foundation, 6 American Law of Mining § 200.04 (2d ed. 1997). Given that split estates were already common at the time the 1909 and 1910 Acts were passed, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Chartiers Block Coal Co.</i> v. <i>Mellon,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></span> (1893), and that the common law has proved adequate to the task of resolving the resulting conflicts between estates, there is no reason to think that the prospect of a split estate would have deterred Congress from reserving only the coal.</p>\n<p>Were a case to arise in which there are two commercially valuable estates and one is to be damaged in the course of extracting the other, a dispute might result, but it could be resolved in the ordinary course of negotiation or adjudication. That is not the issue before us, however. The question is one of ownership, not of damage or injury.</p>\n<p>In all events, even were we to construe the coal reservation to encompass CBM gas, a split estate would result. The United States concedes (and the Tribe does not dispute) that once the gas originating in the coal formation migrates to surrounding rock formations it belongs to the natural gas, rather than the coal, estate. See Brief for Federal Respondents 35; Brief for Respondent Southern Ute Indian Tribe 3, n. 4. Natural gas from other sources may also exist in the lands at issue. Including the CBM gas in the coal reservation would, therefore, create a split gas estate that would be at least as difficult to administer as a split <span class=\"star-pagination\">*880</span> coal/CBM gas estate. If CBM gas were reserved with the coal estate, those developing the natural gas resources in the land would have to allocate the gas between the natural gas and coal estates based on some assessment of how much had migrated outside the coal itself. There is no reason to think Congress would have been more concerned about the creation of a split coal/CBM gas estate than the creation of a split gas estate.</p>\n<p>Because we conclude that the most natural interpretation of \"coal\" as used in the 1909 and 1910 Acts does not encompass CBM gas, we need not consider the applicability of the canon that ambiguities in land grants are construed in favor of the sovereign or the competing canons relied on by petitioners.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i> </p>\n<p>Justice Breyer took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p>Justice Ginsburg, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I would affirm the judgment below substantially for the reasons stated by the Court of Appeals and the federal respondents. See 151 F. 3d 1251, 1256-1267 (CA10 1998) (en banc); Brief for Federal Respondents 14-16. As the Court recognizes, in 1909 and 1910 coalbed methane gas (CBM) was a liability. See <i>ante,</i> at 870-871, 875-876. Congress did not contemplate that the surface owner would be responsible for it. More likely, Congress would have assumed that the coal owner had dominion over, and attendant responsibility for, CBM. I do not find it clear that Congress understood dominion would shift if and when the liability became an asset. I would therefore apply the canon that ambiguities in land grants are construed in favor of the sovereign. See <i>Watt</i> v. <i>Western Nuclear, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 36, 59 (1983) (noting \"established rule that land grants are construed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*881</span> favorably to the Government, that nothing passes except what is conveyed in clear language, and that if there are doubts they are resolved for the Government, not against it\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for Campbell County, Wyoming, by <i>S.
