The case was tried and judgment rendered in favor of the receiver for $74,045.16, being the greater part of the claim, and the securities pledged were ordered to be sold, and the proceeds applied to the payment of the indebtedness adjudged.

With regard to ordinary assets and debts no special direction is needed; no unusual exercise of judgment is required. They are to be collected, of course; that is what the receiver is appointed to do. We think there was no error in the decision of the court below on these points, and that the action was properly brought by the receiver.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Expressing what it was necessary for the receiver to do to collect the assets of the bank, the supreme court of Louisiana said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The receiver here could not sell the collaterals in his hands without obtaining the order of a court of competent jurisdiction, and this order must fix the terms of the sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The object of this suit was to obtain such an order.

It was made for the first time in the brief filed for rehearing. To maintain its availability to plaintiff in error it is claimed that, 'if the state courts were utterly without jurisdiction, it was their duty to dismiss the proceedings <i>ex proprio motu</i>, and such is the jurisprudence of Louisiana.

That the court further erred in not setting aside the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*90</span> judgment of the lower state court and rejecting the demand of the defendant in error.\"</p>\n<p>The claim presented in the trial court and in the Supreme Court, as expressed by the latter, was \"that it was necessary for the receiver to aver and prove he was authorized by the Comptroller of the Currency, United States Treasury Department, to institute the present action and to sell at public auction the collaterals pledged to secure the indebtedness declared on, and that without this authorization the judgment recovered cannot stand.\"</p>\n<p>On that contention both courts passed. It was discussed at length by the Supreme Court, and was held to have \"no sufficient basis of fact to rest upon.\" This conclusion was based on the ruling in <i>Bank</i> v. <i>Kennedy,</i> 17 Wall. 19. We think it was correctly based on that decision.</p>\n<p>Section 5234 of the Revised Statutes enacts:</p>\n<p>\"That on becoming satisfied, as specified [in this act], that any association has refused to pay its circulating notes as therein mentioned, and is in default, the Comptroller of the Currency may forthwith appoint a <i>receiver,</i> and require of him such bond and security as he shall deem proper, who, <i>under the direction of a Comptroller,</i> shall take possession of the books, records and assets of every description of such association, <i>collect all debts, dues and claims belonging to it,</i> and, upon the order of a court of record of competent jurisdiction, may sell or compound all bad or doubtful debts, and, on a like order may sell all the real and personal property of such association, on such terms as the court shall direct; and may, if necessary to pay the debts of such association, enforce the individual liability of the stockholders [provided for by the twelfth section of this act]; and such receiver shall pay over all money so made to the Treasurer of the United States, subject to the order of the Comptroller,\" etc.</p>\n<p>This section was construed in <i>Bank</i> v. <i>Kennedy</i><i>,</i> and Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for the court, after distinguishing between stockholders and ordinary debtors of the national bank, which was the ground of decision in <i>Kennedy</i> v. <i>Gibson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88113\"><a href=\"/opinion/88113/kennedy-v-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span>, 506, said:</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*91</span> \"The language of the statute authorizing the appointment of a receiver to act <i>under the direction of the Comptroller</i> means no more than that the receiver shall be <i>subject</i> to the direction of the Comptroller. It does not mean that he shall do no act without special instructions. His very appointment makes it his duty to collect the assets and debts of the association. With regard to ordinary assets and debts no special direction is needed; no unusual exercise of judgment is required. They are to be collected of course; that is what the receiver is appointed to do. We think there was no error in the decision of the court below on these points, and that the action was properly brought by the receiver.\"</p>\n<p>Expressing what it was necessary for the receiver to do to collect the assets of the bank, the Supreme Court of Louisiana said:</p>\n<p>\"The receiver here could not sell the collaterals in his hands without obtaining the order of a court of competent jurisdiction, and this order must fix the terms of the sale.</p>\n<p>\"The object of this suit was to obtain such an order. The civil district court of the parish of Orleans is a court competent to grant the order. It did so.\"</p>\n<p>The other point now made, to wit, that the state courts had no jurisdiction of the petition of the receiver because under paragraphs 3, 10 and 11 of section 629, and the proviso of section 4 of the act of Congress adopted August 13, 1888, the courts of the United States had exclusive jurisdiction, was not made in the trial court nor in the Supreme Court at the original hearing. It was made for the first time in the brief filed for rehearing. To maintain its availability to plaintiff in error it is claimed that \"if the state courts were utterly without jurisdiction, it was their duty to dismiss the proceedings <i>ex proprio motu,</i> and such is the jurisprudence of Louisiana. Where there is a want of jurisdiction <i>ratione materia,</i> it is not too late to suggest or raise it on rehearing or at any time.\"</p>\n<p>Whether such was the duty of the state courts and what questions could be suggested or raised on rehearing, the Supreme Court was undoubtedly competent and able to decide. For this court we need only say that we have decided too often to make <span class=\"star-pagination\">*92</span> it necessary to do more than announce the rule, that to render a Federal question available on writ of error from a state court it must have been raised in the case before judgment, and cannot be claimed for the first time in a petition for rehearing. <i>Meyer</i> v. <i>Richmond,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94946\"><a href=\"/opinion/94946/meyer-v-richmond/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span>, 92 and cases cited.</p>\n<p>As there is no error in the record, judgment is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>MR.
