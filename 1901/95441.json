The order, however, contained a proviso that it should not be operative until a date designated, to enable the defendants to apply, under the 4th section of the act, to be relieved from the operation of that section in respect to the prohibition therein contained against charging or receiving any greater compensation for a lesser than for a longer haul, under substantially similar circumstances and conditions. 5 I.

The court decided that the Commission had erroneously construed the statute in holding that competition which was actual and substantial in its effect upon rates, if resulting from the action of other carriers who were subject to the Act to Regulate Commerce, could not produce the dissimilarity of circumstances and conditions provided in the 4th section of the act, so as to enable a carrier in adjusting rates to take into view such competition without the previous assent of the Commission.

S. 164, 42 L. ed. 422, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 45, we had occasion to refer to the opinion announced by the Commission in the cases now under review, because the ruling of the Commission in the matter which was examined in the <i>Midland Case</i> was like the one made in the present cases. The opinion by which the Commission sustained the ruling by it made in the <i>East Tennessee, Virginia, &amp; Georgia Case</i>, which we have just examined and decided to be erroneous, was also expressly predicated on the opinion which the Commission had previously expressed in these cases. It follows that the error committed by the Commission in interpreting the statute in these cases has been at least twice heretofore pointed out in the decisions of this court, and hence further examination of the subject is unnecessary. It will be seen from an inspection of the able opinions of the courts below that they expounded the statute in entire accord with the construction which we had previously given to it, and which we have again applied in the <i>East Tennessee, Virginia, &amp; Georgia Case</i>. Despite, however, the error of law which the Commission committed in these cases, and in consequence of which error it made no investigation of the facts, but postponed the performance of its duty on this subject until a further application was made for relief, it is now urged that we should enter into an original investigation of the facts for the purpose of considering a number of questions as to discrimination, as to preference, as to reasonableness of rates, as to the relation which the rates at some places bore to those at others, in order to discharge the duty which the statute has expressly in the first instance declared should be performed by the Commission. In the <i>East Tennessee, Virginia, &amp; Georgia Case</i>, just decided, 181 U. S. 1, <i>post</i>, p. 516, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 516, following the ruling made in <i>Louisville &amp; N. R. Co.</i> v. <i>Behlmer</i>, 175 U. S. 648, 667, 44 L. ed. 309, 316, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 209, and previous cases, we have held that, where the Commission by reason of its erroneous construction of the statute had, in a case to it presented, declined to adequately find the facts, it was the duty of the courts, on application being made to them to enforce the erroneous order of the Commission, not to proceed to an original investigation of the facts which should have been passed upon by the Commission, but to correct the error of law committed by that body, and, after doing so, to remand the case to the Commission so as to afford it the opportunity of examining the evidence and finding the facts as required by law. The investigation which we have given the questions which arise in these cases, and the consideration which we have bestowed on the issues which were involved in the case of the East Tennessee, Virginia &amp; Georgia Railroad, have served but to impress upon us the necessity of adhering to that rule, in order that the statute may be complied with both in letter and spirit.
