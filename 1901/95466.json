This is a bill, of which, unless by consent of the defendants, the district court of the United States, as was directly adjudged by this court at the last term, since the first hearing of this case in the circuit court of appeals, has no jurisdiction under the bankrupt act of 1898. <i>Bardes</i> v. <i>First Nat.
