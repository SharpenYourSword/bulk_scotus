It was alleged in the bill that the plaintiff company had, in June, 1872, sold and delivered to the defendant company certain materials and supplies to be used in the erection of the lighting apparatus, powerhouse, station, and railway of the defendant, of the value of $2,787.04, and that said supplies and material were used in the construction of the lighting apparatus and railway of said defendant, situated in Put-in-Bay island, in Ottawa county, Ohio, and that the entire amount of said claim was due and unpaid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bill further alleged that on September 7, 1892, the plaintiff company had filed with the recorder of Ottawa county an affidavit containing an itemized statement of the amount and value of the materials and supplies furnished under said contract of sale, with a statement of the account and terms of payment to be made thereunder and a description of the premises upon which said lighting apparatus and railway were located, which said statement and all connected therewith were duly recorded by said recorder in a book kept for that purpose; that the plaintiff has a lien on the premises and all the property of defendant company from the 7th day of June, 1892, for the amount due with interest; and that, in the premises, the plaintiff was entirely without remedy according to the strict rules of the common law, and could only have relief in a court of equity, where matters of such a nature were properly cognizable and reviewable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bill further alleged that the Railway Equipment Company, a corporation and citizen of the state of Illinois; John Arbuckle, Charles Ryan, and W. J. Ryan, citizens of the state of Ohio; James K. Tillotson, a citizen of the state of Ohio; the Cleveland Electrical Manufacturing Company, a corporation and citizen of the state of Ohio; the Industrial &amp; Mining Guaranty Company, a corporation and citizen of the state of New York; John P. Carrothers, a citizen of the state of New York; and H. H. Warner, a citizen of the state of New York,&#8212;claimed to have some interest in the premises upon which the plaintiff claimed the aforesaid lien; and the bill prayed that each of said parties should be required to appear and set up their respective claims, or be forever barred from setting up the same against the plaintiff. The bill prayed for an account with the defendant company, and for a decree of sale of said premises, etc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 10, 1892, an answer and cross bill were filed by J. K. Tillotson. In this cross bill it was alleged that said Tillotson had built and equipped the railroad of the defendant company, and had received in payment therefor the stock of said company and mortgage bonds to the amount of $125,000; that he had contracted with John P. Carrothers and H. H. Warner, as owners and controllers of the Industrial &amp; Mining Guaranty Company of New York (named as defendants in the bill of complaint), to sell and dispose of said stock and bonds, but that said Carrothers and Warner had not sold or accounted for the said stock or bonds, but that siad Carrothers, claiming to be the owner of the capital stock of said defendant company, had elected himself president thereof, and had taken possession of said railroad, etc. It was thereupon prayed, in said cross bill, that a restraining order should be issued against said Carrothers and Warner and the said Industrial &amp; Mining Guaranty Company, forbidding them, during the pendency of this suit, from selling or disposing of said stock and bonds, and that the court should appoint a receiver to take charge and custody of the railway and property in plaintiff's bill of complaint described, with instructions to care for and operate the same under the order of the court, and as, in the judgment of the court, might be for the interest of all parties concerned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereupon, on September 10, 1892, a subpoena was issued summoning said Carrothers, Warner, and the Industrial &amp; Mining Guaranty Company to appear and answer said cross bill. On the same day a temporary restraining order was issued against said Carrothers and Warner as prayed for in the cross bill, and one L. S. Baumgardner was appointed receiver, who gave a bond as such receiver in form and amount approved by the United States district judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States marshal made return that he had served the restraining order and subpoena on said John P.

The said answer contained the following allegations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'This defendant says that it is not true that Exhibit 'A' attached to complainant's bill contains a true and correct statement of the material so sold by the complainant to this defendant as aforesaid. And it is not true that all of said supplies and materials contained in said Exhibit 'A' were used in the construction of the said railway. But, on the contrary, this defendant says that a large part of said materials were sold and delivered to said J. K. Tillotson, defendant, for the purpose of being used, and which were used, in the construction of certain property known as Hotel Victory on South Bass island. This defendant says that it is not true that the material sold to this defendant by said complainant as aforesaid were of the value of $2,787.04, as set forth in said Exhibit 'A,' but on the contrary this defendant is informed and believes, and so states the fact to be, that the material so sold by said complainant to this defendant, through its vice president, the defendant Tillotson, for the purpose of being used in the construction of said railway, and which were so used, amounted in value to about the sum of $700, and no more. . . . This defendant further says that the said complainant, when it sold the said Tillotson the material set forth in Exhibit 'A' of said complaint, well knew that a large part of said material was so sold and delivered for the purpose of being used, and were used, in the construction of Hotel Victory, of which the said Tillotson was president, and which had no connection whatever with this defendant's railroad. And this defendant alleges that said complainant, at the request of said Tillotson, procured a lien to be filed with the recorder of Ottawa county against this defendant's property, on the day previous to the filing of the complainant's complaint herein, and for the entire amount of the material sold to this defendant and also sold to said Tillotson for the use of said Hotel Victory. And said lien was so filed by said complainant at the request of said Tillotson, for said amount, and for the express purpose of instituting this action in this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'And this defendant prays that this honorable court may take an account of material sold by complainant to and for the use of the defendant, to be used in the construction of said railway, and the amount of said material so sold, which has actually been used in the construction thereof. And that the court may determine the value of siad material so sold to and used by this defendant, and the actual amount of the lien which said complainant has on account thereof against the property of this defendant.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 26, 1892, the Put-in-Bay Waterworks, Light, &amp; Railway Company filed an answer to the cross bill of Tillotson, admitting some and denying many of the allegations thereof, and containing the following allegation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'This answering defendant further says that on or about the 3d day of September, 1892, the said defendant Tillotson, attempting to interfere with the said company in the operation of its said railway, and to prevent the said company from the peaceable enjoyment of its said property, the common pleas court of Ottawa county, Ohio, on the petition of said Put-in-Bay Waterworks, Light, &amp; Railway Company, issued a restraining order enjoining the said defendant James K. Tillotson from interfering or attempting to interfere in any manner with the said company in the operation of its railway, and which said restraining order is still in full force and effect.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It also appears that the defendant company sued out of the court of common pleas a writ of replevin against Tillotson, but it is not shown what the property levied on was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Afterwards, on September 30, 1892, the answer and cross bill of Arbuckle, Ryan, &amp; Company, who had been named as defendants in said suit, was filed, in which it was, among other things, alleged that said firm had furnished a large amount of machinery and of labor for the said Put-in-Bay Waterworks, Light, &amp; Railway Company, which went into the construction of said railroad and powerhouse of said company, on which there was unpaid and due to the said Arbuckle, Ryan, &amp; Company a balance of $11,153.60, and for which they had filed, on August 17, 1892, with the recorder of Ottawa county, Ohio, an affidavit and itemized account, by virtue of which proceeding they had obtained a lien upon the property and railroad of the defendant, the said railroad company. They therefore prayed for an account, and for an order directing the sale of the said property and railroad, and for the payment of their claim out of the proceeds of such sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 15, 1892, L. S. Baumgardner, theretofore appointed receiver, filed a petition showing cause why certain expenditures incident to the care and preservation of the railroad and its property since they had come into his hands, and other expenditures necessary to be made, required him to raise a sum of not less than $5,000, and prayed for leave to issue receiver's certificates for that purpose. This was followed by an order of the court authorizing the receiver to issue certificates to the amount of $5,000, and declaring said certificates to be a first lien upon all the property of said railway company in the hands of said receiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Afterwards, on October 29, 1892, a motion to discharge the receiver was made on behalf of the defendant railway company, which was accompanied by an affidavit of J. P. Carrothers, as president of said company, in which, among other things, it was stated that on September 3, 1892, the affiant, as president of said company, was compelled to and did institute replevin proceedings to obtain possession of the personal property of said company, and that by virtue of said action the property of said company was turned over to affiant as president thereof, excepting the books, papers, muniments of title, and certain other of the personal property belonging to said company which were taken away and secreted by said Tillotson; and that said railway company obtained from the court of common pleas of Ottaws county a restraining order enjoining Tillotson from interfering with the company's peaceable enjoyment of the possession and control of said Put-in-Bay Waterworks, Light, &amp; Railway Company, its property and business, such order to take effect upon the plaintiff giving an undertaking, as provided by law, in the sum of $5,000, to the satisfaction of the clerk of said court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Afterwards, on November 12, 1892, an affidavit of one F. S. Terry, as manager and attorney of complainant company, was filed in the present case, in which, among other things, it was stated that the Electric Supply Company was induced to include all sums due for material furnished for use of the Hotel Victory Company in its account against said railroad; that the amount actually used in the construction of the Put-in-Bay Waterworks, Light, &amp; Railway Company amounted to $861.23; that the balance of said material, to the amount of $1,925.81, was used inside of said Hotel Victory; that all of said material was ordered by said defendant Tillotson, as vice president of said defendant corporation, and was charged upon the books of the plaintiff corporation to the said Put-in-Bay Waterworks, Light, &amp; Railway Company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 22, 1892, the court overruled the motion to dismiss the receiver and to modify the order to said receiver to issue certificates; and an order was made, on the further petition of the receiver, allowing him to issue additional certificates to the amount of $5,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 20, 1893, an appeal from the decree of the circuit court overruling the motion to discharge the injunction and to modify the order authorizing the receiver to issue certificates, and retaining jurisdiction, was taken by the Industrial &amp; Mining Guaranty Company, a corporation of New Jersey, and one of the defendants in the cause, to the circuit court of appeals for the sixth circuit; and, on June 22, 1893, that court reversed the decree of the circuit court, the injunction was dissolved, and the cause was remanded to the circuit court, with directions for further proceedings in conformity with the opinion of the circuit court of appeals. 7 C. C. A. 471, 16 U. S. App. 196, 58 Fed.

The master further found that the reasonable compensation to which the receiver was entitled was $2,200; of which $1,200 were for his personal services, and $1,000 for his attorney's fees. He also found that the expenses and costs incurred by the defendant, the Industrial &amp; Mining Guaranty Company, consisting principally of attorney's fees, amounted to the sum of $8,795.25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, on June 12, 1894, the circuit court made the following order:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'This day this cause came on for further hearing upon the motion of the Industrial &amp; Mining Guaranty Company, the Put-in-Bay Waterworks, Light, &amp; Railway Company, and John P.

And the court, having heard the evidence and the arguments of counsel, and being now fully advised in the premises, does grant said motion conditionally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'It is therefore ordered, adjudged, and decreed that, upon the payment into court of the amount due on the certificates issued by L.

Hall purchased said certificates for full value and in good faith, relying upon the orders of this court, and is the present owner and holder thereof; that the same have not been paid, nor has anything been paid to the said Walker P. Hall on account thereof, and that they are still a first lien upon all of the property and franchises of the defendant company, the Put-in-Bay Waterworks, Light, &amp; Railway Company, and that said cross petitioners are not entitled to have said cause dismissed until said receiver's certificates and expenses and the costs of this cause are paid in full.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 5, 1895, a motion was made by the Put-in-Bay Waterworks, Light, &amp; Railway Company to dismiss said action, and to direct the receiver theretofore appointed to forthwith deliver the property of the company in his possession and under his control, etc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 6, 1896, Judge H.

Whatever, then, may have been the nature or merits of the questions between the railway company and Tillotson, it is conceded that the actual possession of the property, whether real or personal, was in the railway company at the time when, in the suit of the Electrical Supply Company, the receiver was appointed by the circuit court of the United States. It is too plain for argument that the replevin suit, affecting only certain articles of personal property, and arising out of a controversy between the railway company and Tillotson, its vice president, could not draw into the jurisdiction and control of the state court the railroad and franchises of the railway company, so as to preclude creditors of the company from instituting proceedings in the Federal court. As respects the restraining order, if such were even issued, it does not appear that Tillotson ever disobeyed it, and, if he did, he personally would be answerable to the state court. It may be further observed that it is not made to appear that the restraining order ever became operative as an injunction by the filing of a bond in $5,000, which was imposed as a condition for its issuance. At all events, and conclusively as to the merits of this contention, the property and franchises which are the subject-matter of the present suit were not, either actually or constructively, in the possession of the state court when the Federal court appointed its receiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our inspection of this record has not constrained us to hold that the circuit court lost its apparent jurisdiction of the case by reason of disclosures made subsequently in the progress of the case. The mere denial that the materials sold by the complainant to the railway company were of the value alleged in the bill did not, of itself, deprive the court of jurisdiction. Thereby was presented a question of fact into which the court had jurisdiction to inquire. Within the letter of the statute there was a controversy between citizens of different states, in which the matter in dispute was over the sum or value of $2,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 5th section of the act of March 3, 1875 (18 Stat. at L. 470, chap. 137), provided that if 'any suit commenced in a circuit court, . . . it shall appear to the satisfaction of said circuit court, at any time after such suit has been brought or removed thereto, that such suit does not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly within the jurisdiction of said circuit court, . . . the said circuit court shall proceed no further therein; but shall dismiss the suit.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And it has been several times decided by this court that a suit cannot properly be dismissed by a circuit court as not involving a controversy of an amount sufficient to come within its jurisdiction, unless the facts, when made to appear on the record, create a legal certainty of that conclusion. <i>Barry</i> v. <i>Edmunds</i>, 116 U. S. 550, 29 L. ed. 729, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 501; <i>Wetmore</i> v. <i>Rymer</i>, 169 U. S. 115, 42 L. ed. 682, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 293.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not clearly shown in this record that, at any time after the suit was brought, it was made to appear, <i>to the satisfaction of the circuit court</i>, that the suit did not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly within the jurisdiction of said circuit court.

And subsequently, on December 15, 1899, the final decree or order of sale was entered, in which the court reserved for further consideration, as between Atlantic Trust Company and the Bodefield Belting Company, any and all questions arising between them as to the priority of their respective liens. A sale of all the property of the defendant railway company, in pursuance of said decree, was made on February 24, 1900; and, no objections or exceptions to the sale having been filed by any of the parties, on March 26, 1900, the sale was confirmed absolutely, and the master directed to execute a deed for the property so sold by him to the purchasers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appears that, under the intervening petitions of other creditors than the complainant, there were involved, before and at the time of the decree of sale, liens and claims against the defendant's property largely in excess of the amount necessary to confer plenary jurisdiction on the circuit court.

JUSTICE SHIRAS, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>The contention in the brief on behalf of the appellant, that \"by the service of the writ of replevin issued from the state court the property came into the custody and possession of that court for all purposes of jurisdiction in that case, and no other court had a right to interfere with that possession except a court having a direct supervisory control over the court issuing the writ, or some superior jurisdiction in the premises, the state court having placed the property in the possession of the officers of the railway company as against the claim of Tillotson, by a writ of replevin, the United States Circuit Court in this case had no jurisdiction to issue an injunction or to appoint a receiver, by means of which the company and its officers were prevented from using and operating the railway property, which the state court had directed its officers to place in their hands,\" seems to answer itself.</p>\n<p>By the operation of the writ of the state court certain personal property of the Put-in-Bay Waterworks, Light and Railway Company was taken from the possession of one Tillotson and restored to that of the company, and by a restraining order Tillotson was prohibited from interfering with the use and operation by the company of its railway property. Whatever, then, may have been the nature or merits of the questions between the railway company and Tillotson, it is conceded that the actual possession of the property, whether real or personal, was in the railway company at the time when, in the suit of the Electrical Supply Company, the receiver was appointed by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*430</span> Circuit Court of the United States. It is too plain for argument that the replevin suit, affecting only certain articles of personal property, and arising out of a controversy between the railway company and Tillotson, its vice president, could not draw into the jurisdiction and control of the state court the railroad and franchises of the railway company, so as to preclude creditors of the company from instituting proceedings in the Federal court. As respects the restraining order, if such were ever issued, it does not appear that Tillotson ever disobeyed it, and, if he did, he personally would be answerable to the state court. It may be further observed that it is not made to appear that the restraining order ever became operative as an injunction by the filing of a bond in $5000, which was imposed as a condition for its issuance. At all events, and conclusively as to the merits of this contention, the property and franchises which are the subject-matter of the present suit were not, either actually or constructively, in the possession of the state court when the Federal court appointed its receiver.</p>\n<p>Our inspection of this record has not constrained us to hold that the Circuit Court lost its apparent jurisdiction of the case by reason of disclosures made subsequently in the progress of the case. The mere denial that the materials sold by the complainant to the railway company were of the value alleged in the bill did not, of itself, deprive the court of jurisdiction. Thereby was presented a question of fact into which the court had jurisdiction to inquire. Within the letter of the statute there was a controversy between citizens of different States, in which the matter in dispute was over the sum or value of two thousand dollars.</p>\n<p>The fifth section of the act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 470, provided that if in \"any suit commenced in a Circuit Court, . . . it shall appear to the satisfaction of said Circuit Court, at any time after such suit has been brought, that such suit does not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly within the jurisdiction of said Circuit Court, the said Circuit Court shall proceed no further therein, but shall dismiss the suit.\"</p>\n<p>And it has been several times decided by this court that a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*431</span> suit cannot properly be dismissed by a Circuit Court as not involving a controversy of an amount sufficient to come within its jurisdiction unless the facts, when made to appear on the record, create a legal certainty of that conclusion. <i>Barry</i> v. <i>Edwards,</i> 116 U.S. 550; <i>Wetmore</i> v. <i>Rymer,</i> 169 U.S. 115.</p>\n<p>It is not clearly shown in this record that, at any time after the suit was brought, it was made to appear, <i>to the satisfaction of the Circuit Court,</i> that the suit did not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly within the jurisdiction of said Circuit Court.
