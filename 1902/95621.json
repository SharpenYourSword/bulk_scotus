S. 60, 44 L. ed. 72, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 13, and then entered the following decree:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'This cause having heretofore come on to be heard upon the pleadings and exhibits on file, and upon full and legal proofs introduced and taken in the cause, both written and oral, and upon the original and other documents regarding said claim from file number 104 in the office of the surveyor general of the territory of New Mexico and from other sources in said office; and the court having considered the same, and having heard counsel for all of the parties to the cause, and being fully advised in the premises, and on due consideration thereof, doth make the following findings of fact and law, that is to say:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'1. That in the year 1768 a valid and perfect title in fee simple to all of the land of the sitio de San Jose do Encinal, situated in what is now Valencia county, New Mexico, was by the proper officers of the Spanish government, the then sovereign power of what is now the territory of New Mexico, granted in equal shares unto Baltazar Baca and his two sons, and which said tract of land, situated in said county as aforesaid, was and is described as follows, that is to say: It is bounded on the east by a tableland; thence it extends westward 5,000 Castilian varas to a sharp-pointed black hill; on the north it is bounded by the Cebolleta mountain; on the south it is bounded by some white bluffs, at whose base runs the Zuni road,&#8212;all as the same is known and designated upon the maps, plats, and surveys in file number 104 in the office of the surveyor general of the territory of New Mexico.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'2. That such title so remained in said grantees and their successors from thence hitherto, and up to and including the time of the cession of the land now comprised in the territory of New Mexico to the United States, and has so continued from thence to the present time.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'3. That the said grantees and their successors have from the time of the making of said grant complied with all conditions necessary to the validity of the same.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'4. That such title in such grantees and their successors to said tract of land was and is complete, valid, and perfect, and so was at the date of the cession of the land now comprised in the territory of New Mexico to the United States by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo; and the same was and is such a title as the United States is bound to recognize and confirm by virtue of said treaty and otherwise.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'5. That the claimant, Margarito Baca, is a lineal descendant of the said Baltazar Baca, one of the original grantees.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'6. But the court further finds, as a matter of fact, that the land comprised within the tract aforesaid is included within the outboundaries of the town of Cebolleta grant, reported number 46, and the Paguate purchase tract, reported number 30; the said Cebolleta grant having been confirmed to the claimants thereof by an act of Congress approved March 3, 1869, and thereupon duly patented to said claimants by the proper authorities of the United States; and the said Paguate purchase tract having been confirmed to the Indians of the pueblo of Laguna by an act of Congress approved June 21, 1860, and thereupon patented to said pueblo by the proper authorities of the United States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'7. Wherefore it is considered and adjudged by the court that a complete, valid, and perfect title in and to the tract of land above described was and is vested in the said Baltazar Baca and his two sons and their successors in interest; but that, notwithstanding such fact, this court is without jurisdiction, because of the patents for the said land so as aforesaid issued by the United States, to decree and confirm the same unto them, or to order a survey thereof for such purpose, and for such reason no other or different relief than the pronouncing upon the character of the claimant's title as aforesaid is or will be granted by this court, and it is so ordered.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States appealed to this court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr.</i> <i>Matthew G.

and on such application said court shall proceed to hear, try and determine the validity of the same and the right of the claimant thereto, its extent, location and boundaries, in the same manner and with the same powers as in other cases in this act mentioned. If in any such case a title so claimed to be perfect shall be established and confirmed, such confirmation shall be for so much land only as such perfect title shall be found to cover, always excepting any part of such land that shall have been disposed of by the United States, and always subject to and not to affect any conflicting private interests, rights or claims held or claimed adversely to any such claim or title, or adversely to the holder of any such claim or title. And no confirmation of claims or titles in this section mentioned shall have any effect <span class=\"star-pagination\">*659</span> other or further than as a release of all claim of title by the United States; and no private right of any person as between himself and other claimants or persons, in respect of any such lands, shall be in any manner affected thereby.\"</p>\n<p>But all the powers so conferred upon the Court of Private Land Claims are subject to and controlled by section 13, which enacts that \"all the foregoing proceedings and rights shall be conducted and decided subject to the following provisions, as well as to the other provisions of this act, namely.\" Then follow several provisions, the fourth of which is: \"No claim shall be allowed for any land, the right to which has hitherto been lawfully acted upon and decided by Congress, or under its authority.\"</p>\n<p>The language of this provision appears to us too clear to be misunderstood or evaded. The manifest intent of Congress appears to have been that with any land, of the right to which Congress, in the exercise of its lawful discretion, had itself assumed the decision, the Court of Private Land Claims should have nothing to do. The whole jurisdiction conferred upon that court is to confirm or reject claims presented to it, coming within the act. All the powers conferred upon it are incident to the exercise of that jurisdiction. When it has no jurisdiction to confirm or reject, it has no authority to inquire into or pass upon the case, beyond the decision of the question of jurisdiction. The peremptory declaration of Congress, that \"no claim shall be allowed for any land, the right to which has hitherto been lawfully acted upon and decided by Congress,\" necessarily prohibits the court from passing upon the merits of any such claim.</p>\n<p>In <i>United States</i> v. <i>Conway,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95105\"><a href=\"/opinion/95105/united-states-v-conway/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, it was accordingly declared by this court that the Court of Private Land Claims had no authority to confirm such a claim; and it necessarily follows that it has no authority to express any opinion upon the merits of it, when the right to all the land claimed has already been decided by Congress. <i>Las Animas Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 179 U.S. 201. Confusion, rather than certainty, would result from allowing the expression of an opinion to stand, which could not be made the basis of any effectual judgment.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*660</span> The Court of Private Land Claims having discovered that by the express prohibition of Congress it was without jurisdiction to decree and confirm the land to the petitioner, the merits of the case cannot be decided, either by that court, or by this court on appeal; and the decree below, which undertook to pass upon the merits, must therefore be reversed, and the case remanded with directions to dismiss the petition for want of jurisdiction, without prejudice to the right of the petitioner to assert his title in any court of competent authority. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Roselius,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86817\"><a href=\"/opinion/86817/united-states-v-roselius/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 38.</p>\n<p><i>Decree reversed accordingly.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 95621, "judges": "Gray, After Stating the Case as Above", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/95621/", "sha1": "cc4cb4d886fbf93f5f6d72851394da738cf4ae5e", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:38:19"}
