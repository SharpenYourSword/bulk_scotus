Upon appeal to the appellate division of the supreme court the action of the court of original jurisdiction was confirmed. The case was then carried to the court of appeals of the state, and the judgment of the lower court was affirmed.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon writ of error to this court, it has been assigned for error that the judgment of the state court was in violation of the provisions of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States; also, that the judgment deprived the home of the equal protection of the law and of its property without due process of law.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record contains a certificate by the chief judge of the court of appeals of New York to the effect that in this proceeding the Home for Incurables claimed in the courts of the state that 'the imposition of all or a part of the assessment on its land as set forth in the record herein was in violation of the statutes and Constitution of the state of New York and of the provisions of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, and constituted a taking of property without due process of law; that the respondent in this proceeding contended that the said assessment was neither in whole nor in part in violation of the statutes and Constitution of the state of New York or of the Constitution of the United States, and also that the said Home for Incurables had no remedy by petition to correct any errors in the said assessment; that this court decided that the said Home for Incurables did have a remedy by petition in the manner and form of the proceeding adopted by it to correct any errors in the said assessment, but that the assessment complained of was valid and without error as to each and every part thereof.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. John M.

But it does not appear on the face of the record that it set up or claimed any such right until the case reached this court. In <i>Parmelee</i> v. <i>Lawrence</i>, 11 Wall. 36, 38, 20 L. ed. 48, 49, this court&#8212;following the previous cases of <i>Lawler</i> v. <i>Walker</i>, 14 How. 152, 14 L. ed. 365, and <i>Mississippi</i> &amp; <i>M. R. Co.</i> v. <i>Rock</i>, 4 Wall. 177, 18 L. ed. 381,&#8212;said it was essential to our jurisdiction in re-examining the judgment of the state court that the alleged conflict between the state law and the Constitution of the United States 'appear in the pleadings of the suit, or from the evidence in the course of the trial, in the instructions asked for, or from exceptions taken to the rulings of the court,' or 'it must be that such a question was necessarily involved in the decision, and that the state court would not have given a judgment without deciding it.' Later cases in this court have expressed the additional thought that if the highest court of the state assumes that the record sufficiently presents a question of Federal right and decides against the party claiming such right, we will look no further, and will proceed to a consideration of that question, unless the decision is made to rest, in part, upon some ground of local law, sufficient enough in itself to sustain the judgment, independently of any question of Federal right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case before us, the Home for Incurables has not brought upon the record the fact that it asserted, in the state court, any Federal right whatever. It is entirely consistent with the record that the home did not, at any time pending the case in the state court, set up or claim any such right. If our jurisdiction is invoked on the ground that the judgment of the state court has denied a right, title, privilege, or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States, it is essential, under existing statutes, that such right, title, privilege, or immunity shall have been specially set up or claimed in the state court.
