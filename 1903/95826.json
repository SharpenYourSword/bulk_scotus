The corporation was located in the city of Memphis, Shelby county, Tennessee, and that city, pursuant to an act of the legislature of Tennessee, assessed an ad valorem tax for the year 1899, for municipal purposes, on the capital stock of the bank. The bank thereupon filed its bill in the circuit court of the United States for the western division of the western district of Tennessee, in which it was alleged that the law under which the assessment was made impaired the obligation of the contract created by the above-quoted clause of the charter. The bill further averred that in a former litigation between the bank and the city, wherein it was sought to enforce a municipal assessment of taxes on the capital stock of the bank for the years 1888, 1889, and 1890, it was adjudged by the supreme court of Tennessee that, by the provision aforesaid, the capital stock of the corporation was exempt from all general taxation. The record and judgment in that suit were set out in full, and pleaded as a final judicial determination of the bank's exemption from the payment of ad valorem taxes on its capital stock; and it was averred that the judgment so pleaded was based on the identical claim of exemption now asserted, and on identically the same facts and conditions under which this assessment was made.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prayer was that the assessment be canceled, and complainant be declared to be exempt from the payment to the city of ad valorem taxes on its capital stock.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants demurred, and the demurrer was sustained and the bill dismissed, November 6, 1900, whereupon complainant prayed and perfected an appeal to, and also took a writ of error from, the United States circuit court of appeals for the sixth circuit, and the case was docketed there on or about November 27, 1900.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 11, 1901, complainant prayed, and was granted an appeal from the decree of the circuit court directly to this court, the record was filed here, March 23, 1901, and the case is now No. 67.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case in the circuit court of appeals was heard June 10, 1901, and the decree below was affirmed October 21, 1901. 49 C. C. A. 455, 111 Fed. 561. Thereupon complainant, appellant in that court, prosecuted an appeal from its decree to this court, and the case was docketed here January 13, 1902, and is now No. 221.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both cases were submitted, as one case, on printed briefs.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Messrs.</i> <i>William H.

The appeal lay directly to this court under &#167; 5 of the judiciary act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 547), and not to the circuit court of appeals. <i>American Sugar Ref. Co.</i> v. <i>New Orleans</i>, 181 U. S. 277, 45 L. ed. 859, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 646. Nevertheless, an appeal having been prosecuted to the latter court, and having there gone to decree, an appeal was allowed to this court because the judgment was not made final in that court by &#167; 6 of the act. But the case being here, and the jurisdiction of the circuit court having depended on the sole ground that it arose under the Constitution, we are constrained to reverse the decree of the circuit court of appeals, not on the merits, but by reason of the want of jurisdiction in that court. If this were not so, the right to two appeals would exist in every similar case, notwithstanding, as we have repeatedly held, that such was not the intention of the act. <i>Robinson</i> v. <i>Caldwell</i>, 165 U.

The question as to which was the correct route to reach this court became immaterial, and we disposed of the ease on its merits.

The judgment thus relied on as a bar to this assessment is reported in <i>Memphis</i> v. <i>Union &amp; Planters' Bank</i> (1892) 91 Tenn. 546, 19 S. W. 758, which involved the assessment of municipal taxes for the years 1887 to 1891 inclusive, on the capital stock of the bank, and a privilege tax for the years 1889, 1890, and 1891. The supreme court of Tennessee there held, in deference to the supposed scope of the decisions of this court in <i>Farrington</i> v. <i>Tennessee</i> (1877) 95 U. S. 679, 24 L. ed. 558, and in <i>Bank of Commerce</i> v. <i>Tennessee</i> (1881) 104 U.

Rep. 558, was followed, and it was held to be the settled rule in Tennessee that the plea of <i>res judicata</i> is only applicable to the taxes actually in litigation, and is not conclusive in respect to taxes assessed for other and subsequent years. <i>State</i> v. <i>Bank of Commerce</i>, 95 Tenn. 231, 31 S.
