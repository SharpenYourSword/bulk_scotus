It was a bill in equity in which Lewis and others were complainants and Rawleigh Colson was the sole defendant. It came here on certificate, and the title was Lewis and others against Colson, and not as given in the report. The case stated shows that the case was removed from the state court into the Circuit Court of Kentucky, and that the complainants were citizens of Virginia, but the citizenship of defendant was not disclosed. The headnote asserts that the parties were citizens of Kentucky. But the certificate of the clerk, as appears from our files, sets forth \"that it is stated in the bill that the defendant Rawleigh Colson is a citizen of the State of Virginia.\"</p>\n<p>In both cases the parties were citizens of the same State and the cases were originally commenced in the state courts, and the Circuit Courts acquired jurisdiction by removal. The Judiciary Act of 1789 vested the Circuit Courts with original jurisdiction on the ground of diversity of citizenship, but not where title was claimed under grants of different States. Congress manifestly accepted the letter of the Constitution and as the judicial power extended to controversies where citizens of the same State claimed title under grants of different States, assumed that cases presenting such controversies would be commenced in the state courts, and provided that those cases might be removed when that fact was made to appear. The particular constitutional provision was treated as not open to a construction which would make it embrace <span class=\"star-pagination\">*170</span> citizens of different States. Naturally enough, as the reason for the extension of the Federal judicial power to controversies between citizens of different States, and to controversies between citizens of the same State claiming lands under grants of different States, was in substance the same. 2 Story Const. § 1696.</p>\n<p>And when the act of 1875 enlarged the original jurisdiction, no view to the contrary was indicated.</p>\n<p><i>Ayres</i> v. <i>Polsdorfer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95760\"><a href=\"/opinion/95760/ayres-v-polsdorfer/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">585</span></a></span>, was an action of ejectment brought in the Circuit Court by citizens of one State against those of another, and the case, having gone to judgment, was carried to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and the judgment affirmed. A writ of error from this court was then sought to be sustained because, as was contended, the evidence disclosed, though the pleadings did not, that the parties claimed under grants of different States. But we held that if the emergence of such a question might have justified taking the case directly to this court, having gone to the Court of Appeals, it could not after judgment then be brought here.</p>\n<p>As Congress has not conferred jurisdiction on the Circuit Courts over controversies between citizens of different States because, apart from diversity of citizenship, they may have claimed title by grants from different States, even if it had power to do so, which is not conceded, the result is that the appeal must be</p>\n<p><i>Dismissed.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 96133, "judges": "Fuller, After Making the Foregoing Statement", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/96133/", "sha1": "47614a3209ecda421a2e4a250260e6850bfcb553", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:41:19"}
