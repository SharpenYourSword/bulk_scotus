But it is said that, by necessary intendment the validity of an act of the general assembly of Florida of May 30, 1901, was drawn in question as repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, and its validity sustained. The act referred to provided that &#167; 970 of the Revised Statutes of Florida was thereby amended so as to read: 'Any and all judgments, decrees, and orders heretofore or hereafter rendered in causes where the disqualifications appear of record in the cause, shall be void; but where the disqualification does not so appear, they shall not be subject to collateral attack.'
