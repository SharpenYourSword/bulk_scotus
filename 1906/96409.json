Mr. Hoffman informed him that he had advanced Reinhard &amp; Company $2,000.00 on that morning, and suggested that he pay the balance to him. He agreed to this, and gave him the check as suggested.

The doctrine of rescission and following of trust funds can have no application, especially when, as expressly agreed in the statement of facts, the money which the defendant in error gave to Reinhard &amp; Company in exchange for its draft 'was used by Reinhard &amp; Company to pay checks drawn on them, and was paid out over their counter on April 10, 1900, to their customers.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio must be reversed</i> and the case remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "<div>\n<center><b>200 U.S. 420 (1906)</b></center>\n<center><h1>RECTOR<br>\nv.<br>\nCOMMERCIAL NATIONAL BANK.</h1></center>\n<center>No. 138.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Submitted December 12, 1905.</center>\n<center>Decided February 19, 1906.</center>\nERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF OHIO.\n<p><i>Mr. D.F.
