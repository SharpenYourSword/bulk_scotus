The main objection is to the allowance of any costs at all. The power of the court to allow costs is not disputed. <i>Pennsylvania</i> v. <i>Wheeling &amp; B. Bridge Co.</i> 18 How. 460, 15 L. ed. 449. The former decree in this case allowed them, and, in the stipulation for the appointment of a special commissioner, the parties agreed that the costs should be 'taxed by the court on the final disposal of the case, to be paid in such manner as the court may, at that time, determine.' But it is said that it is inconsistent with the dignity of a sovereign state to ask for costs; that, in boundary cases, costs have been divided, and that the suit was not for a pecuniary interest, but only the performance of the duty of a sovereign to its citizens, for which no costs should be imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So far as the dignity of the state is concerned, that is its own affair. The United States has not been above taking costs. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Sanborn</i>, 135 U. S. 271, 34 L. ed. 112, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 812. As to the supposed rule in boundary cases, it is not absolute. But, in many cases of that kind, both parties are equally interested to have the boundary settled, and, whichever state begins the suit, both equally are actors. Thus counter relief was asked by the defendants in <i>Nebraska</i> v. <i>Iowa</i>, 143 U. S. 359, 36 L. ed. 186, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 396, and <i>Missouri</i> v. <i>Iowa</i>, 160 U. S. 688, 40 L. ed. 583, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 433. As to the nature of this suit, the plaintiff alleged serious pecuniary damage to itself by the deposit of great quantities of filth upon the portion of the bed of the Mississippi alleged to belong to it, and, in short, framed its bill like any ordinary bill by a private person to restrain a nuisance. The chief difference was in the size of the nuisance alleged. There is no indication that the defendants desired or needed the determination of this court, as states well might when their jurisdiction was in doubt. So far as this point is concerned, there is no reason why the plaintiff should not suffer the usual consequence of failure to establish its case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only item specially discussed is the charge of $2.50 for each witness examined before the examiner, on the footing of 'depositions' mentioned in Rev.

See <i>Strauss</i> v. <i>Meyer</i>, 22 Fed. 467; 1 Foster, Fed. Pr. 3d ed. 727, &#167; 330.

The words of the statute are broad enough to embrace the testimony, unless they are taken very strictly, and the trouble to the parties in having to visit different places was similar to that caused by the taking of depositions adverted to by Judge Treat in <i>Strauss</i> v. <i>Meyer</i>.
