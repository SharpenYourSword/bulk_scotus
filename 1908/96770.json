Wrich purchased his land in 1881 from the Union Pacific Railroad Company, and received his deed in 1890. The land lay within overlap grants to the Union Pacific Company and the Sioux City &amp; Pacific Railroad Company. Wrich took possession immediately after his purchase, and ever afterwards held and claimed the land as his own. In September, 1893, he undertook to make a cash entry of the land under the act of 1887 [24 Stat. at L. 556, chap. 376, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1595], as did his neighbor, Wises.
