The latter ground was repeated in many ways, and it was alleged, with much repetition, that the court had no jurisdiction to grant the motion of the state, and it was prayed that the motion be denied in so far as it sought to have a judgment entered, or supplied, or to supply the want of the property judgment in the court below, and in so far as it sought to have the court criminal appeals make any other order than to issue its mandate in accordance with its opinion theretofore rendered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court granted the motion of the state, holding that the judgment was in the ordinary form and complete, so far as it went, but that it did not comply with certain requirements of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the state, in that it did not declare, as provided in subdivisions 9 and 10 of art. 831, that it was considered by the court that the defendant be adjudged guilty of the offense as found by the jury, and that the defendant be punished as determined by the jury. The court further held that it had the power to reform and correct the judgment so as to bring it into accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

From this <i>data</i> certainly we can do that which the court <i>a quo</i>, in due order, should have done. We accordingly hold that the judgment of the court below should be reformed and corrected, so as to make it read, in connection with the judgment as entered, and following the verdict, as follows, to wit:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"It is therefore considered, ordered, and adjudged by the court that the defendant, William McCorquodale, is guilty of the offense of murder in the first degree, as found by the jury, and that he, the said William McCorquodale, be punished, as has been determined by the jury, by imprisonment for life in the penitentiary; and it is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed by the court that the state of Texas do have and recover of and from the defendant, William McCorquodale, all costs of this prosecution, for which execution may issue; and that the said defendant is now remanded to jail to remain in custody to await the further order of the court.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The state's motion to reform is accordingly granted; the judgment is reformed and corrected, as above indicated, and, as reformed and corrected, the judgment is affirmed in accordance with the previous opinion of this court.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In answer to the motion of the state, the defendant did not set up that the action invoked by the state would, if granted, contravene the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.

It is true that we have also decided that, if the court entertains the motion and passes on the Federal question, we will review its decision. But it must appear that the court has done so.

The defendant, by his counsel, excepted, and opposed the State's motion to reform and affirm the judgment, on the following grounds: (1) The motion was not disposed of at the term which it was filed; (2) It was not such a motion as is contemplated by law, is not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*435</span> a motion for rehearing nor a motion for the court to correct its own judgment, but it is a motion to enter an original judgment, which the lower court alone has the power to do at the proper time, and that the Court of Criminal Appeals has no power to so do. The latter ground was repeated in many ways, and it was alleged, with much repetition, that the court had no jurisdiction to grant the motion of the State, and it was prayed that the motion be denied in so far as it sought to have a judgment entered, or supplied, or to supply the want of the proper judgment in the court below, and in so far as it sought to have the Court of Criminal Appeals make any other order than to issue its mandate in accordance with its opinion theretofore rendered.</p>\n<p>The court granted the motion of the State, holding that the judgment was in the ordinary form and complete so far as it went, but that it did not comply with certain requirements of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the State, in that it did not declare, as provided in subdivisions 9 and 10 of Art. 831, that it was considered by the court that the defendant be adjudged guilty of the offense as found by the jury, and that the defendant be punished as determined by the jury. The court further held that it had the power to reform and correct the judgment so as to bring it into accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court, after reciting the proceedings and reviewing prior cases, concluded its opinion as follows:</p>\n<p>\"`Reform' means to correct; to make anew; to rectify. Rapalje Law Dic. p. 1083. Here we have all of the foundation of the judgment, including the verdict of the jury, which is the basic rock on which the judgment is formulated. We have, following this, the final judgment of the court, which is the sentence. This itself adjudicates the guilt of appellant and sentences him, in accordance with the verdict and judgment. From this data certainly we can do that which the court <i>a quo,</i> in due order, should have done. We accordingly hold that the judgment of the court below should be reformed, and corrected, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*436</span> so as to make it read, in connection with the judgment as entered, and following the verdict, as follows, to wit:</p>\n<p>\"`It is therefore considered, ordered and adjudged by the court that the defendant, William McCorquodale, is guilty of the offense of murder in the first degree, as found by the jury, and that he, the said William McCorquodale, be punished, as has been determined by the jury, by imprisonment for life in the penitentiary; and it is further ordered, adjudged and decreed by the court that the State of Texas do have and recover of and from the defendant, William McCorquodale, all costs of this prosecution, for which execution may issue; and that the said defendant is now remanded to jail to remain in custody to await the further order of the court.'</p>\n<p>\"The State's motion to reform is accordingly granted; the judgment is reformed and corrected, as above indicated, and, as reformed and corrected, the judgment is affirmed in accordance with the previous opinion of this court.\"</p>\n<p>In answer to the motion of the State, the defendant did not set up that the action invoked by the State would, if granted, contravene the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. He however presented a petition for, to quote from the petition, \"a rehearing upon the State's motion to `reform and affirm,'\" and urged as one of the grounds thereof the following:</p>\n<p>\"This court's said opinion is further erroneous in that it, in effect, deprives appellant of that due process of law guaranteed him by the constitution of the State of Texas, and that of the United States, in this: that it is in effect the rendering of a judgment against him in his absence, and the authorization of sentence against him without a judgment.\"</p>\n<p>The other grounds of the motion for rehearing were repetitions of the grounds urged in the answer to the State's motion and other grounds based on the local procedure, the basis of all being the want of jurisdiction in the court.</p>\n<p>The order of the court on the motion for a rehearing was as follows:</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*437</span> \"This cause came on to be heard on appellant's motion for a rehearing, and the same being considered by the court said motion is overruled.\"</p>\n<p>This court has decided many times that it is too late to raise a Federal question for the first time in a petition for rehearing in the court of last resort of a State after that court has pronounced its final decision. <i>Loeber</i> v. <i>Schroeder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"93653\"><a href=\"/opinion/93653/loeber-v-schroeder/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span>, 585; <i>Pim</i> v. <i>St. Louis,</i> 165 U.S. 273. It is true that we have also decided that if the court entertains the motion and passes on the Federal question, we will review its decision. But it must appear that the court has done so. <i>Mallett</i> v. <i>North Carolina,</i> 181 U.S. 589; <i>Leigh</i> v. <i>Green,</i> 193 U.S. 79; <i>Corkran Oil Co.</i> v. <i>Arnaudet,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96334\"><a href=\"/opinion/96334/corkran-oil-development-co-v-arnaudet/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span>, 193; <i>Fullerton</i> v. <i>Texas,</i> 196 U.S. 192; <i>McMillen</i> v. <i>Ferrum,</i> 197 U.S. 343. It can hardly be said to so appear in the case at bar. The order of the court is nothing more than a denial of the motion. In other words, it expresses no more than would be implied from a simple denial of the motion.</p>\n<p><i>Writ of error dismissed.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 96910, "judges": "McKenna", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/96910/", "sha1": "996ccf07b193027342d40beb2ce9a0ea463348b2", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:41:44"}
