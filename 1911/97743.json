L. 576; treaty of 1889, art. 1, 26 Stat. at L. 1508, 1509; penal law [N. Y.] &#167;&#167; 400, 404), had been committed by a breaking into the building in question with intent to steal the automobile there kept. It was shown that this took place between 4 and 6 o'clock on the morning of September 15th, 1911. The car was taken out of the building and rolled about 40 feet down the street, where, shortly before 6 o'clock on that morning, according to testimony, the appellant was seen standing in front of the car, 'trying to crank it;' 'he was trying,' said the witness, 'to start the machine off.' Three men, unidentified, were with him. On an examination of the car soon after, it was found that the cover had been removed from the spark coil and that several of the electric wires forming part of the motive equipment had been disarranged in an effort, apparently, to operate the car despite the absence of a switch plug.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that this was evidence connecting the appellant with the crime upon which, in the light of the circumstances proved, the commissioner was entitled to exercise his judgment. We agree with this view. Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613, 619, 620, 40 L. ed. 1090, 1094, 1095, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 895. It is objected that while possession of property recently stolen may be evidence of participation in the larceny, the apparent possession of the automobile by the appellant affords no support for a conclusion that he committed the burglary, the crime with which he was charged. The permissible inference is not thus to be limited. The evidence pointed to the appellant as one having control of the car and engaged in the endeavor to secure the fruits of the burglarious entry. Possession in these circumstances tended to show guilty participation in the burglary. This is but to accord to the evidence, if unexplained, its natural probative force. Considine v.
