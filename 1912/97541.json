It is claimed 'that the indictment, in order to be sufficient, should have stated <i>the particular matter</i> which was being investigated by the grand jury at the time, and to which it was claimed the alleged false testimony was material;' and that if the alleged false testimony concerning Hawk's final proof upon his land 'became material collaterally in some other later matter, of which the grand jury did have jurisdiction, . . . the collateral matter should have been set forth, and the indictment should have alleged that it was material in relation to that matter, so that the defendant could have an opportunity to intelligently defend as to the materiality of the alleged evidence, as well as to other elements of the offense.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reduced to their final analysis the contentions but assert that the indictment did not apprise the accused of the crime charged with such reasonable certainty that he could make his defense and be protected after judgment against another prosecution for the same offense.

A less definite description was held sufficient in the Markham Case, where the indictment specified 'an inquiry then pending before and within the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Pensions of the United States, at Washington, in the District of Columbia.' As the specification of the identity of a defendant and the precise nature of his offense is normally the end, and not the beginning, of grand jury proceedings (Hale v. Kenkel, 201 U.

Sitting as a grand jury . . . and, amongst other matters, inquiring into certain criminal violations of the laws of the said United States relating to the public lands and the disposal of the same, and the unlawful fencing thereof, which had then lately before been committed within the said district.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*184</span> That this description adequately advised the defendant as to the identity of the proceeding in which the perjury was committed is settled by the following authorities: <i>Markham</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94325\"><a href=\"/opinion/94325/markham-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 320; <i>Williamson</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 207 U.S. 425; <i>Rosen</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94359\"><a href=\"/opinion/94359/rosen-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 34, 40; <i>Dunbar</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94084\"><a href=\"/opinion/94084/dunbar-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span>, 192; <i>Bannon</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94111\"><a href=\"/opinion/94111/bannon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span>, 468; <i>Coffin</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94110\"><a href=\"/opinion/94110/coffin-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span>, 452, and <i>Kirby</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95045\"><a href=\"/opinion/95045/kirby-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 64. A less definite description was held sufficient in the <i>Markham Case,</i> where the indictment specified \"an inquiry then pending before and within the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Pensions of the United States, at Washington, in the District of Columbia.\" As the specification of the identity of a defendant and the precise nature of his offense is normally the end, and not the beginning of grand jury proceedings (<i>Hale</i> v. <i>Henkel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96424\"><a href=\"/opinion/96424/hale-v-henkel/\"><span class=\"volume\">201</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 61, 65), and the very object of the proceeding may have been to determine the identity of the criminal, it was not essential that the proceedings should state the name of a specified defendant under investigation.</p>\n<p>That the indictment was not wanting in definiteness, because therein it was in effect simply alleged that before the grand jury, after Hawk had been sworn, the truth of the recited matters concerning which it was subsequently alleged Hawk testified falsely, \"became and was a material question,\" and it was not specified in just what evidentiary way the perjured testimony became material, is settled by the <i>Markham Case</i> (160 U.S. 324, 325), where a similar point was directly held to be without merit.</p>\n<p>As, in view of prior decisions, the contention based upon the Sixth Amendment was manifestly frivolous, it results that the writ of error must be dismissed.</p>\n<p><i>Writ of error dismissed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]   That Hamilton H. Hendricks, late of the County of Wheeler, in the said district, on the fifteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and five, at and within the said County of Wheeler, in the said district, unlawfully did wilfully and corruptly suborn, instigate and procure one George W. Hawk to appear in person before them the said grand jurors, then and from thence hitherto sitting at the city of Portland, in the said district, as a grand jury of the Circuit Court of the said United States for the said district, <i>and, amongst other matters, inquiring into certain criminal violations of the laws of the said United States relating to the public lands and the disposal of the same, and the unlawful fencing thereof, which had then lately before been committed within the said district,</i> and to take his oath before the said grand jury, and upon his oath so taken to testify, depose and swear before the said grand jury in substance and to the effect <i>that when he the said George</i> <i>W. Hawk made his application dated October 19, 1898, and filed in the land office of the said United States at The Dalles, Oregon, on October 21, 1898,</i> to enter certain public lands known and described as the southeast quarter of the southeast quarter of section two, the east half of the northeast quarter of section eleven, and the southwest quarter of the northwest quarter of section twelve, in township seven south and range twenty-two east, reference being had to the Willamette meridian and base line, as a homestead, under the laws of the said United States concerning homesteads, the same was honestly and in good faith made for the purpose of actual settlement and cultivation, and not for the benefit of any other person, persons, or corporations; that he the said George W. Hawk was not acting as agent of any person, corporation or syndicate in making such entry, nor in collusion with any person, corporation or syndicate to give them the benefit of the land so entered, or any part thereof, or the timber thereon; that he was not applying to enter the said lands for the purpose of speculation, but in good faith and to obtain a home for himself; that he had not made, and would not make, any agreement or contract with any person or persons, corporation or syndicate, by which the title which he should acquire from the said United States in the said lands would inure to the benefit of any person except himself, and that he himself paid the fees required by law to be paid upon the filing of such application;  that when he the said George W. Hawk, <i>on the second day of March, in the year nineteen hundred,</i> subscribed and swore to his affidavit and testimony of final proof of settlement upon and cultivation of the said lands, he had there-fore, to wit, in the month of April, 1899, commenced his residence on the said lands, and had not sold, conveyed or mortgaged any portion of the said lands: And thereupon the said George W.
