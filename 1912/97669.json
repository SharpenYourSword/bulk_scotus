But when it is remembered what clear evidence the court requires before it declares legislation otherwise valid void on this ground, and when it is considered how speculative every figure is that we have set down with delusive exactness, we are of opinion that the result is too near the dividing line not to make actual experiment necessary. The Master thought that the probable net income for the year that would suffer the greatest decrease would be 8.60 per cent. on the values estimated by him. The Judge on assumptions to which we have stated our disagreement makes the present earnings 5 10/17 per cent. with a reduction by the ordinance to 3 6/17 per cent. The whole question is too much in the air for us to feel authorized to let the injunction stand.</p>\n<p><i>Decree reversed without prejudice.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 97669, "judges": "Holmes", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/97669/", "sha1": "f105ce751085f7aa5dd86084bb9d49a169c890f1", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:42:39"}
