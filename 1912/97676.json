The statute provides for inspection and analysis. Under &#167; 6, it is the duty of the state food and dairy commissioner to 'cause to be made analyses of all concentrated commercial feeding stuffs and agricultural seeds sold or offered for sale in this state.' For this purpose, that officer is authorized 'in person or by deputy, to take for analysis a sample from any lot or package of concentrated commercial feeding stuffs in this state,' and further provision is made to assure the representative character of the sample. The results of the analyses are to be published from time to time in official bulletins. The state food and dairy commissioner is required to enforce the statute, and to this end is authorized to appoint, with the approval of the executive council, such analysts and chemists as may be necessary to carry it into effect.

The essential character of the exaction was not altered. If it be said that this provision discriminates against one doing a small business, still the appellant wholly fails to show that it is thereby injured and thus entitled to complain. On the contrary, the bill alleges that the appellant 'sells to more than eight hundred dealers in the state of Iowa, besides a very large number of customers who buy direct from your orator or through its agents,' and that it 'has been enabled to sell in the state of Iowa during the past year and for a number of years preceding a quantity of its goods in an amount exceeding $40,000 per annum.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case in this aspect falls within the established rule that 'one who would strike down a state statute as violative of the Federal Constitution must bring himself by proper averments and showing within the class as to whom the act thus attacked is unconstitutional.

Nor is there any conflict with the Food and Drugs Act of June 30, 1906, c. 3915, 34 Stat. 768; <i>Savage</i> v. <i>Jones, supra</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>2. The statute provides for inspection and analysis. Under § 6, it is the duty of the State Food and Dairy Commissioner to \"cause to be made analyses of all concentrated commercial feeding-stuffs and agricultural seeds sold or offered for sale in this State.\" For this purpose, that officer is authorized \"in person or by deputy, to take for analysis a sample from any lot or package of concentrated commercial feeding-stuffs in this State,\" and further provision is made to assure the representative character of the sample. The results of the analyses are to be published from time to time in official bulletins. The State Food and Dairy Commissioner is required to enforce the statute and to this end is authorized to appoint, with the approval of the executive council, such analysts and chemists as may be necessary to carry it into effect. Violation of any of the provisions of the act is made a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p>We are of opinion that the statute must be considered as an inspection law which it was within the power of the State to enact, and that its fair import is that the fees exacted by § 5 above quoted are for the purpose of meeting the expense of inspection. The bill alleges no facts <span class=\"star-pagination\">*550</span> warranting the conclusion that the charge is unreasonable as compared with this expense. <i>Patapsco Guano Co.</i> v. <i>North Carolina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94918\"><a href=\"/opinion/94918/patapsco-guano-co-v-north-carolina-bd-of-agricultu/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">345</span></a></span>, 347, 354, 361; <i>McLean</i> v. <i>Denver &amp; Rio Grande R.R.

The essential character of the exaction was not altered. If it be said that this provision discriminates against one doing a small business, still the appellant wholly fails to show that it is thereby injured and thus entitled to complain. On the contrary, the bill alleges that the appellant \"sells to more than eight hundred dealers in the State of Iowa, besides a very large number of customers who buy direct from your orator or through its agents,\" and that it \"has been enabled to sell in the State of Iowa during the past year and for a number of years preceding a quantity of its goods in an amount exceeding $40,000 per annum.\"</p>\n<p>The case in this aspect falls within the established rule that \"one who would strike down a state statute as violative of the Federal Constitution must bring himself by proper averments and showing within the class as to whom the act thus attacked is unconstitutional. He must show that the alleged unconstitutional feature of the law injures him, and so operates as to deprive him of rights protected by the Federal Constitution.\" <i>Southern Ry.
