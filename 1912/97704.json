Among his liabilities was a judgment rendered in the city court of New York April 16, 1895, in favor of the defendants in error, Guasti and Bernard. Miller applied at a special term of the supreme court of the county of New York for an order canceling the judgment under &#167; 1268 of the Code of Civil Procedure, because of the discharge in bankruptcy. The supreme court held that he was not entitled to have the judgment canceled. The order was affirmed by the appellate division, and its order was affirmed by the court of appeals. 203 N. Y. 259, 96 N. E. 416. That order being entered in the supreme court, this writ of error was sued out.

The court further found that Guasti and Bernard knew nothing of the proceedings in bankruptcy until long after the discharge, and first learned of them August 23, 1910. The court of appeals further found that the affidavits filed sustained the finding of the special term that Miller had actual knowledge of the residence and postoffice address of Guasti and Bernard. Such finding of fact is binding upon this court, and is, moreover, amply sustained by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy act provides, &#167; 17:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'A discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts, except such as . . . have not been duly scheduled in time for proof and allowance, with the name of the creditor, if known to the bankrupt, unless such creditor had notice or actual knowledge of the proceedings in bankruptcy.'
