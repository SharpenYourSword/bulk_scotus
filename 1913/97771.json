The bill alleges the failure of the condition referred to, and seeks a conveyance of the interest in the mining claims and an account.

The vendors owned the mining claims and had given an option to purchase the West Brooklyn claim and another, not concerned here, to the United Verde Copper Company, which was extended and kept in force up to January 1, 1908. In 1906 a stockholder in the appellant had begun a suit on behalf of himself and others, afterwards amended so as to make the appellant plaintiff, to have the Millers and Lasbury, also stockholders, declared trustees for the appellant of the mining claim now in question. Miller, on the other hand, had sued the appellants for work done upon the Brooklyn claim. By way of compromise the present contract was made. It recited the two suits and the conditional sale of the West Brooklyn claim to the United Verde Copper Company, and provided, in consideration of the dismissal and settlement of the foregoing causes of action, that if the sale to the United Verde Company was consummated by January 1, 1908, the above-mentioned transfer of stock should be made, etc., but that if, for any reason, the sale should not be consummated, then the conveyance now sought for should take place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The contract in full is as follows:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, an action is now pending in the district court of Yavapai county, Arizona, entitled Brooklyn Mining &amp; Milling Company et al. v.

Lasbury are to transfer and deliver to the said Brooklyn Mining &amp; Milling Company one hundred and seventy-five thousand shares (175,000) of stock in said Brooklyn Mining &amp; Milling Company, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances whatsoever; it being understood that said transfer of stock is to include all of the holdings of said Charles C. Miller, Alonzo V. Miller, and George B. Lasbury in the Brooklyn Mining &amp; Milling Company, and the said parties are to receive therefor the sum of 3 (three) cents per share for said stock; and in addition thereto Charles C. Miller, Alonzo V. Miller, and George B. Lasbury are to pay to the Brooklyn Mining &amp; Milling Company the sum of eight thousand, five hundred dollars ($8,500) out of the proceeds derived from the sale of the said West Brooklyn mining claim; in addition thereto the said Charles C. Miller, Alonzo V. Miller, and George B. Lasbury are to convey all of their right, title, and interest in and to the East Brooklyn, South Brooklyn, North Brooklyn, Empress, and Midway mining claims, and said transfer shall contain the warranty that the assessment work has been done for the year 1907 upon the Empress, Midway, and North Brooklyn, and the said Brooklyn Mining &amp; Milling Company shall pay the said assessment work at its reasonable value. The said Charles C. Miller, Alonzo V. Miller, and George B. Lasbury agree to do the assessment work for the year 1907, on the East and South Brooklyn mining claims, and said assessment work so to be performed is to be paid for by the Brooklyn Mining &amp; Milling Company at its reasonable value. It is further stipulated and agreed by and between the parties hereto that if for any reason the sale of the West Brooklyn claim to the United Verde Copper Company by the said Charles C.

Then on January 2, 1908, the vendors, alleging consummation of the contract with the United Verde Company, tendered performance, which was declined on the ground that it did not comply with the terms of the present agreement, and there was a second refusal to dismiss the company's suit. On February 15, however, it did dismiss that suit, and ten minutes later began the present one. This was tried in March, 1909, and the court found that the sale to the United Verde Company had not been consummated, and that the failure was caused by the refusal of the plaintiff to dismiss its former above-mentioned suit, which, it will be remembered, impeached the title of the vendors.
