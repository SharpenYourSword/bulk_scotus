He was therefore within the provision of the section set out, and the only question is whether, under that provision, his advance in grade and in pay is to be made upon the grade he held when he was retired, or upon the grade and pay he had when this act was approved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He had been retired as of May 3, 1895, while holding the rank of first lieutenant in the revenue-cutter service, with one half of the pay of a first lieutenant on the active list, under the act of March 2, 1895 (28 Stat. at L. 920, chap. 189, U.

Supp. 1911, p. 879), he and all other officers upon the retired or permanent waiting list were give 75 per cent of the duty pay of the rank they had when retired. By a special act of February 25, 1905 (33 Stat. at L. 813, chap. 796), he was advanced 'one grade from first lieutenant to that of captain,' for meritorious acts while in the service of the Navy and of the revenue-cutter service of the United States, but with no increase in pay by the advance in grade thereby authorized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only trouble about the meaning of the act arises out of the exceptional fact that the decedent had, after his retirement, been advanced one grade in rank, but without any advance in pay by reason of that advancement. The act obviously meant to provide that every revenue-cutter officer then on the active list should, upon retirement, advance one step in grade, with three fourths of the duty pay of the advanced grade. The same benefit was also extended to officers already on the retired list.

The basis of the gratuity of Congress was the grade and pay at retirement.
