Immediately north of the depot of the railway company at Marshall, Texas, two tracks run east and west. At the time here in question, on the track farthest from the depot, the more northern of the two, there stood a train scheduled shortly to depart east for Shreveport, Louisiana. A party, including the defendant in error, accompanying a friend, who was leaving on such train, came to the depot and crossed over to the waiting train. While they were there a train bound west for Texarkana, which was behind time, came in and was stopped on the track immediately north of the depot, and therefore stood between the track on which the Shreveport train was standing and the platform of the depot. When the party, after bidding goodby to their friend, started to return to the depot, they found the Texarkana train barring their passage. The vestibules, however, between some or all of the cars of this train, were open, and most of the party crossed through an open vestibule to the depot platform. When, however, the defendant in error was doing so, by a sudden jerking movement of the train, made without any notice or warning, as she alleged, she was thrown down and received the injury for which she sued. It is not traversed that usually persons wishing to go from the depot platform to a train standing on the northern track crossed the open vestibules on trains standing on the track nearest the depot. It was disputed, however, whether, on coming from a train standing on the farthest track, it was usual to cross an open vestibule of an intervening train for the purpose of reaching the depot. There was dispute as to whether notice was given of the movement of the Texarkana train.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court gave to the jury full instructions concerning every aspect of the case, some of which were objected to on the ground that the tendency of the proof was not such as to justify the instructions.
