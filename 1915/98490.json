L. p. 113), which declares: 'Any person who shall hereafter be convicted of selling or offering for sale any vinous, spirituous, malt or brewed liquors, or any admixture thereof, without a license, shall be sentenced,' etc. The superior court affirmed the conviction (53 Pa. Super. Ct. 210), the supreme court of the state refused an appeal, and this writ of error was allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are these: Plaintiff in error is a liquor dealer having his place of business in the county of Mahoning, in the state of Ohio, which immediately adjoins Lawrence county, Pennsylvania. He had no license to sell in Lawrence county, nor any place of business there, but went into that county and there took an order for liquor, with the understanding that the liquor should be thereafter delivered from his stock in Ohio to the residence of the purchaser in Pennsylvania. He returned to Ohio, there loaded the goods upon his own wagon, and either by himself or his employee drove across the state line and delivered the liquor to the residents of the purchaser, pursuant to the contract. Thus the sale was negotiated in Pennsylvania, but contemplated and required for its fulfilment a transaction in interstate commerce, which afterwards took place, with resulting delivery in Pennsylvania.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The charge, as will be observed, was selling, not offering for sale. And it is admitted that by the Pennsylvania decisions the act of taking orders for future delivery is not punishable under the statute cited, or any other, and that it is not the making of an executory contract, but the executed sale, that is punishable.

And so, in the present case, the superior court (53 Pa. Super.
