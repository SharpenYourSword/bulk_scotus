Stat. 1913, &#167; 1215, on the ground that it involves the construction and application of the Constitution of the United States. The plaintiff in error was indicted for placing letters in the mail for the purpose of executing a scheme to defraud devised by him, in violation of &#167; 215 of the Criminal Code, act of March 4, 1909, chap. 321, 35 Stat. at L. 1088, Comp. Stat. 1913, &#167; 10,385. There were twelve counts, on seven of which, each relating to a different letter, he was found guilty. He was sentenced to five year's imprisonment on each count, the periods being concurrent, not cumulative, and also to a fine of $1,000 on each or $7,000 in all. The grounds for coming to this court are, first, that &#167; 215 of the Criminal Code is beyond the power of Congress, as applied to what may be a mere incident of a fraudulent scheme that itself is outside the jurisdiction of Congress to deal with; and second, that if it makes the deposit of each letter a separate offense, subject to such punishment as it received in this case, it imposes cruel and unusual punishment and excessive fines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These contentions need no extended answer.
