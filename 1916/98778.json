The property was in <i>custodia legis</i> and was sold without leave of court. Because of this the court held the sales invalid, and entered a decree canceling the certificates of purchase, and enjoining the county treasurer from issuing tax deeds thereon. Thus far there is no room to complain. Wiswall v. Sampson, 14 How. 52, 14 L. ed. 322; Barton v. Barbour, 104 U. S. 126, 26 L. ed. 672; Re Tyler, 149 U. S. 164, 37 L. ed. 689, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 785; Re Eppstein, 17 L.R.A.(N.S.) 465, 84 C. C. A. 208, 156 Fed. 42. The court further directed in its decree that the several tracts be sold by the trustee free from any lien for the taxes and assessments, and that the holders of the certificates of purchase be severally reimbursed out of the proceeds of the respective tracts, but not out of the general assets, for the taxes and special assessments paid thereon, with the interest and penalties which accrued prior to the time the trustee took possession. Upon appeal to the court of appeals, that court modified the decree by requiring that the certificate holders be reimbursed for the amounts paid at such sales and for subsequent taxes, together with interest thereon, 'as provided by the laws of Colorado on redemption from tax sales of land,' the same to be paid 'out of the general fund, regardless of the amount which the property may bring at bakruptcy sale.' 137 C.

Stat. 1913, &#167; 9648], we entertain no doubt of the propriety of requiring that the certificate holders, who had paid the taxes and assessments at the sales, be reimbursed upon the cancelation of their certificates, or of requiring that the reimbursement be out of the general assets.
