A few days later, in conjunction with a firm creditor, the receivers brought suit in the United States circuit court, fifth circuit, southern district of Alabama, against Latham &amp; Company, a French partnership, Frederick Leyland Steamship Company, Limited, Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Company, and others, seeking to recover 4,200 bales of cotton about to be exported from Mobile, upon the ground that, while insolvent, the bankrupts had transferred it to Latham &amp; Company in payment of prior indebtedness and with intent to prefer them. After being taken into possession by the United States marshal, by order of court, the cotton was released, May 14, 1910, to Latham &amp; Company, who executed a bond conditioned: 'Now, therefore, if the obligors herein shall have forthcoming and deliver within sixty days from date of any final decree of this court said cotton to the proper officer of the court, or shall pay and satisfy such decree as may be rendered in the premises, then this obligation shall be null and void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect.' Later the trustee in bankruptcy was substituted as complainant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">July 1, 1910, Knauth, Nachod, &amp; Kuhne filed in the cause a so-called cross bill, subsequently amended, which on motion was dismissed both for want of equity upon its face and because the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain it. The circuit court of appeals affirmed this action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The amended cross bill is a mass of prolix and vagrant statements and allegations from which it is difficult to spell out any very definite theory. Apparently because $98,000&#8212;approximate market value of 1,300 bales of cotton&#8212;had been fraudulently obtained from Knauth, Nachod, &amp; Kuhne by the bankrupts and used by them in their business, the former sought to impress a trust upon what the latter thereafter acquired, including the 4,200 bales of cotton found at Mobile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The allegations of the bill are wholly inadequate to trace the funds into any specific cotton (Peters v. Bain, 133 U. S. 670, 693, 33 L. ed. 696, 704, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 354), and the cross bill must be regarded as an attempt to secure from the estate priority of payment on account of money fraudulently obtained by the bankrupts and put into their business. Manifestly such a proceeding could not be entertained in the southern district of Alabama. The estate was being administered in another court. Mueller v. Nugent, 184 U. S. 8, 46 L. ed. 408, 22 Sup.
