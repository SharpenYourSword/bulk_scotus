Stilson Company, against William R. Staats Company and Title Insurance &amp; Trust Company, the complaint alleging that the Stilson Company was adjudged a bankrupt on October 24th, 1912; that the Stilson Company made and delivered to the Title Insurance &amp; Trust Company a deed of trust for certain realty, situated in the city of Los Angeles, to secure an indebtedness in the sum of $3,870, due by the Stilson Company to the Staats Company; that the effect of this conveyance was to enable the Staats Company to receive a greater percentage of its indebtedness than other creditors of the same class, and that the conveyance was made with a view to giving a preference, in violation of the Bankruptcy Act, and a decree was prayed declaring the conveyance void and of no effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suit was brought by authority of &#167; 60b of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 [30 Stat. at L. 562, chap. 541, Comp.

On issues made, the case was referred to a special master, who found the conveyance by the Stilson Company to the Tile Insurance &amp; Trust Company to have been made and received as security for an indebtedness in the sum of $3,870, then due by the Stilson Company to the Staats Company, and that the same was an unlawful preference within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act. Upon exceptions to the master's report, the district court overruled some exceptions and sustained others, and dismissed the complaint. An appeal was taken to the circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit, which court reached the conclusion that the conveyance in question was a preference within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act, reversed the decree of the district court, and remanded the case to that court with directions to enter a judgment in favor of the complainant. 147 C.
