The complaint alleges that plaintiffs are the holders of more than 200 of the 500,000 shares of the outstanding stock of the defendant United Copper Company, a New Jersey corporation; that the defendants other than that company have by conduct violating the Sherman Law (Act of July 2, 1890, chap. 647, 26 Stat. at L. 209, Comp. Stat. 1916, &#167; 8820) injured it to the extent of more than $5,000,000;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'IV. In or about the month of January, 1912, and before the commencement of this action, the plaintiffs, United Copper Securities Company and Arthur P.

The case involves, therefore, this single question: Whether a stockholder in a corporation which is alleged to have a cause of action in damages against others for conduct in violation of the Sherman Act may sue at law to recover such damages in the right of the corporation if, after request, it refuses to institute the suit itself? Insuperable obstacles to the maintenance of the action are presented both by the substantive law and by the law of procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not a corporation shall seek to enforce in the courts a cause of action for damages is, like other business questions, ordinarily a matter of internal management, and is left to the discretion of the directors, in the absence of instruction by vote of the stockholders. Courts interfere seldom to control such discretion intra vires the corporation, except where the directors are guilty of misconduct equivalent to a breach of trust, or where they stand in a dual relation which prevents an unprejudiced exercise of judgment; and, as a rule, only after application to the stockholders, unless it appears that there was no opportunity for such application, that such application would be futile (as where the wrongdoers control the corporation), or that the delay involved would defeat recovery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In the instant case there is no allegation that the United Copper Company is in the control of the alleged wrongdoers, or that its directors stand in any relations to them, or that they have been guilty of any misconduct whatsoever. Nor is there even an allegation that their action in refusing to bring such suit is unwise. No application appears to have been made to the stockholders as a body, or indeed to any other stockholders individually; nor does it appear that there was no opportunity to make it, and no special facts are shown which render such application unnecessary. For aught that appears, the course pursued by the directors has the approval of all the stockholders except the plaintiffs. The fact that the cause of action is based on the Sherman Law does not limit the discretion of the directors or the power of the body of stockholders; nor does it give to individual shareholders the right to interfere with the internal management of the corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But even if the circumstances were such as to justify individual stockholders in seeking the aid of the court to enforce rights of the corporation, it is clear that their remedy is not at law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The particular equitable relief sought in Fleitmann v.

Hendrickson and Luther Martin, Jr., filed in this court a motion that they be substituted as plaintiffs in error. The motion recites that they had, on March 1, 1917, been appointed receivers of the United Copper Company by the court of chancery of New Jersey, and had on April 2, 1917, been authorized by it to apply for such substitution. Annexed to the motion is a copy of the petition for appointment of the receivers which alleges that the United Copper Company had on February 28, 1912, been dissolved by proclamation of the governor of New Jersey for failure to pay franchise taxes; and that it had assets of large value; but that its directors named (who, under the statute, thereupon became trustees for the corporation) had taken no steps whatever to collect its assets or settle its affairs and were not fit and proper persons to be intrusted with them. Only by opposing affidavits, filed by defendants, was it disclosed that, on February 10, 1913, more than four years previously, the district court of the United States for the southern district of New York had appointed other receivers of the United Copper Company, and had vested in those receivers the possession of 'all the properties owned by the said defendant' [the United Copper Company] 'or in which the said defendant has any ownership or interest, whether such property be real, personal, or mixed, of whatsoever kind and description, and wheresoever situated, including . . . things in action, credits, stocks, bonds, securities, shares of stock in the corporations described in the said bill of complaint, and all shares of stock, certificates of equitable interest, and other certificates representing any interest in any property, and all other securities of whatsoever character owned by the defendant company or in which it has any interest or which it controls directly or indirectly,' and that on February 14, 1913, the same persons had been appointed ancillary receivers by the United States district court for the district of New Jersey. We have no occasion to consider the power of this court to grant the motion for substitution. See Kansas P. R. Co. v. Twombly, 100 U. S. 78, 81, 25 L. ed. 550.

Only by opposing affidavits filed by defendants was it disclosed that, on February 10, 1913, more than four years previously, the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York had appointed others receivers of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*266</span> United Copper Company, and had vested in those receivers the possession of \"all the properties owned by the defendant [the United Copper Company], or in which the said defendant has any ownership or interest, whether such property be real, personal or mixed, of whatsoever kind and description, and wheresoever situated, including . . . things in action, credits, stocks, bonds, securities, shares of stock in the corporations described in said bill of complaint, and all shares of stock, certificates of equitable interest and other certificates representing any interest in any property and all other securities of whatsoever character owned by the defendant company, on or in which it has any interest, or which it controls directly or indirectly,\" and that on February 14, 1913, the same persons had been appointed ancillary receivers by the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. We have no occasion to consider the power of this court to grant the motion for substitution.

It is without merit and is denied.</p>\n<p><i>Judgment affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The bill is framed on the theory that the injury to the United Copper Company was suffered directly, as a competitor of the other defendants, and the case will be discussed on that supposition. It is proper to observe, however, that the allegations of the bill are ambiguous in this respect, and that the United Copper Company appears to have been a mere holding company, which suffered injury only indirectly as controlling stockholder in various mining companies alleged to have been damaged by the conspiracy and which were not made parties to this suit.</p>\n<p>[1a]  <i>Hawes</i> v. <i>Oakland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90478\"><a href=\"/opinion/90478/hawes-v-oakland/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span>; <i>Quincy</i> v. <i>Steel,</i> 120 U.S. 241; <i>Corbus</i> v. <i>Alaska Treadwell Gold Mining Co.,</i> 187 U.S. 455; <i>Delaware &amp; Hudson Co.</i> v. <i>Albany &amp; Susquehanna R.R.

The latter case was an equity suit by a stockholder to enforce a purely legal claim of the corporation  damages for breach of contract; and the court sustained a demurrer to the bill, not because the suit should have been at law, but because the bill failed to show that complainant had made sufficient effort to induce the directors to enter suit.</p>\n\n</div>", "id": 98961, "judges": "Brandeis", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/98961/", "sha1": "40611fff67a54716a02b6109743c20404c40b067", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:45:53"}
