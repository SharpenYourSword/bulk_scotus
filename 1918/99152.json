The Court of Claims shall have jurisdiction to      hear and determine the claims of those whose property was      taken subsequent to June the first, 1865, under the      provisions of the act of Congress approved March twelfth      [third], 1863, entitled 'An act to provide for the collection      of abandoned property and for the prevention of frauds in      insurrectionary districts within the United States,' and acts      amendatory thereof where the property so taken was sold and      the net proceeds thereof were placed in the Treasury of the      United States; and the Secretary of the Treasury shall return      said net proceeds to the owners thereof, on the judgment of      said court, and full jurisdiction is given to said court to      adjudge said claims, any statutes of limitations to the      contrary notwithstanding.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming that the pardon pleaded in the petition and the decisions of this court relieve the appellant of any disability on account of the claimed disloyalty of his decedent (Carlisle v. United States, 16 Wall. 147, 21 L. Ed. 426), it is clear that he can prevail only if his decedent was the owner of t e cotton when it was seized, for the Court of Claims is given jurisdiction to hear and determine only 'claims of those whose property is taken,' and this language can have no other meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of Whitfield v. United States, 92 U. S. 165, 23 L. Ed. 705, it was decided that a sale of cotton, with payment in bonds, under circumstances precisely similar to those we have here, passed title to the Confederate government without formal delivery, so that the vendor ceased to be the owner of the cotton from the time he accepted the bonds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is frankly conceded by the appellant that this decision rules the case at bar and we are asked to reconsider and overrule it on various grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is argued that, because appellant's decedent in this case (as in that) continued in possession of the cotton until his vendee became insolvent and the bonds given in payment became valueless, he had a lien for the value of it, which constituted him the owner within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The report of the Whitfield Case shows that this claim was pressed upon the attention of this court, and that it was rejected for the reason that the bonds were accepted as payment, as fully as if it had been made in money, with all the incidents of such payment. With this conclusion we are satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also argued that Congress, in enacting this section, intended to give a right of recovery to all persons who sold cotton to the Confederate government, which was afterwards seized by the United States under warrant of the Act of March 3, 1863, referred to, and upon the theory that such sales were void and therefore did not pass title but left the nominal vendors the owners of the cotton, we are urged to so construe the section as to give effect to such supposed intention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is asserted that evidence of this intention is to be found in the fact that if not so construed the section will be ineffective and meaningless, because all claims for property taken from owners under the Act of March 3, 1863, other than for such as was sold to the Confederate government had been disposed of before its enactment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the non-existence of other claims for the statute to operate upon were shown, as it is not, by the petition and the attached exhibit, still this contention could not be allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The intention of the Congress is to be sought for primarily in the language used, and where this expresses an intention reasonably intelligible and plain it must be accepted without modification by resort to construction or conjecture. Gardner v. Collins, 2 Pet. 58, 93, 7 L. Ed. 347; United States v. Goldenberg, 168 U. S. 95, 102, 18 Sup. Ct. 3, 42 L.

C. v. Manning, 186 U. S. 238, 245, 22 Sup. Ct. 881, 46 L.
