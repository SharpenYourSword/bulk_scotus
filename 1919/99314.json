At time of receiver's appointment taxes assessed upon the bankrupt's personal property for the years 1907, 1908 and 1909 were due the city of Richmond for which it had not distrained, although having authority so to do. Respondents, landlords of the bankrupt, under express statutory authority, levied a distress warrant November 1, 1909, upon its goods and chattels on account of rent due for the period since April 1, 1908. The question is whether their claim is entitled to priority of payment over the taxes. The Circuit Court of Appeals answered in the affirmative. Bird v. City of Richmond, 240 Fed. 545, 153 C. C.

That the city of Richmond had no lien for past-due taxes upon these goods and chattels when the chancery court receiver took possession, we think must be regarded as settled by Jackson Coal Co. v. Phillips Line, 114 Va. 40, 49, 50, 75 S. E. 681, 684 (1912), and this notwithstanding differences between its charter, and that of Petersburg.

The property upon which these taxes      were assessed was wholly personal, and no effort appears to      have been made, certainly as to the years prior to 1910,      either by the auditor of the state or by the city of      Petersburg, to collect the taxes until the property was      placed in the hands of the receivers in this cause and an      account of debts against the Phillips Line ordered. The state      had a right, under sections 604-623 of the Code, for one year      from the date on which the taxes in her favor were assessed,      to levy upon the property assessed with the taxes, which      right was not exercised; and it appears that the city of      Petersburg had a right of distress against the property      assessed with taxes in its favor, which the city might have      exercised before the taxes were returned delinquent, or the      property upon which they were assessed had passed into the      hands of subsequent purchasers, and thereby secured a lien      therefor, but these rights were never exercised. Under these      circumstances, neither the state nor the city had a lien upon      the property of the Phillips Line when it went into the hands      of the receivers for the taxes due them, respectively, and,      therefore, the position of the state and city was no better      than that of the general creditors of the company, and they were not entitled to share      in the proceeds of sale of the company's property, except as      to the amount of taxes due them [the state and the city],      respectively, for the year 1910, assessed against and due      from the receivers.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondents therefore must prevail unless priority over their lien is given by section 64a to claim for taxes which, under state law, occupied no better position than one held by a general creditor. Section 67d, Bankruptcy Act, quoted supra, declares that liens given or accepted in good faith and not in contemplation of or in fraud upon this act, shall not be affected by it. Other provisions must, of course, be construed in view of this positive one. Section 64a directs that taxes be paid in advance of dividends to creditors; and 'dividend' as commonly used throughout the act means partial payment to general creditors. In section 65b (Comp. St. &#167; 9649), for example, the word occurs in contrast to payment of debts which have priority. And as the local laws gave no superior right to the city's unsecured claim for taxes we are unable to conclude that Congress intended by section 64a to place it ahead of valid lienholders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">New Jersey v.
