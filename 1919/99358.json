Under it Barbour was convicted for having in his possession on June 10, 1916, more than one gallon of vinous liquor. Georgia Laws, Extraordinary Session 1915, part 1, title 2, No. 4, &#167;&#167; 16 and 30, pp. 90, 99, 105. He asserted that the liquor had been acquired by him before May 1st, and contended that the statute, if construed to apply to liquor so acquired, was void under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court of the state overruled this contention and affirmed the sentence. 146 Ga. 667, 92 S. E. 70.

Campbell, 245 U. S. 304, 38 Sup. Ct. 98, 62 L. Ed. 304; but it did not appear there when the liquor had been acquired. Whether the prohibition of sale may be constitutionally applied to liquor acquired before the enactment of the statute was raised in Bartemeyer v. Iowa, 18 Wall. 129, 21 L. Ed. 929, and Beer Co. v. Massachusetts, 97 U. S. 25, 32, 33, 24 L. Ed. 989, but was not decided. The question presented here, however, is simpler. For the exact date when Barbour acquired the liquor is not shown; and we must assume, as the Supreme Court of Georgia did, that it was acquired during the period of five months and twelve days between the enactment of the law and the date when it became effective.

It is well settled that the federal Constitution does not enable one to stay the exercise of a state's police power by entering into a contract under such circumstances. Diamond Glue Co. v.
