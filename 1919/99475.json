Instead of assessing this amount directly against the property, the city council erroneously assessed it against the street car company. Thereafter, the city and the Severns Company, which had put down the paving, procured from the district court of Oklahoma county a mandamus directing a reassessment against the land itself, but a hearing upon objections thereto was not specifically provided for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court of the state (170 Pac. 216) declared:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The fee title to the strip of land in question here appears to be in the railway company. * * * Its right is      not merely an intangible privilege or an easement, but under      the terms of the dedication is a fee simple title. * * * The      dominion and control of the strip of land in question here is      not in the city authorities.
