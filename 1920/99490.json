On the other hand, if in the beginning or during its subsequent operation the pipe line was devoted by its owner to public use, and if the right thus extended to the public has not been withdrawn, there can be no doubt that the pipe line is a public utility and its owner a common carrier whose rates and practices are subject to public regulation. Munn v. Illinois, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute court, upon examining the evidence, concluded that the company voluntarily had devoted the pipe line to the use of the public in transporting oil, and it rested this conclusion upon the grounds, first, that one of the things which the company was authorized to do, if it so elected, as shown in its articles of incorporation, was 'to establish and carry on * * * a general transportation business for the purpose of transporting * * * any of the oils * * * produced * * * by this corporation or any other person, firm, partnership, association or corporation'; second, that in acquiring its right of way it resorted to an exercise of the power of eminent domain&#8212;admissible only if the condemnation was for a 'public use,' Code Civ. Proc. &#167;&#167; 1237, 1238; and was by 'an agent of the state,' Civ. Code, &#167; 1001&#8212;and in that proceeding asserted, and obtained a judgment reciting, that it was engaged in transporting oil by pipe line 'as a common carrier for hire,' and that the right of way was sought for 'a public use'; and, third, that looking through the maze of contracts, agency agreements and the like, under which the transportation was effected, subordinating form to substance, and having due regard to the agency's ready admission of new members and its exclusion of none, it was apparent that the company did in truth carry oil for all producers seeking its service, in other words, for the public. See Pipe Line Cases, 234, U. S. 548, 34 Sup. Ct. 956, 58 L. Ed. 1459.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While some criticism is made of this conclusion and the grounds upon which it is rested, we are of opinion that the grounds have adequate support in the evidence and that they sustain the conclusion. True, one witness stated that 'the pipe line was not laid upon the right of way which was obtained in the condemnation suit'; but, as his further testimony disclosed that he meant only that a part of the right of way so obtained was not used when the pipe line was laid, we think the state court rightly regarded the company as having acquired some of its actual right of way by exercising the power of eminent domain as a common carrier. If it was a common carrier at the time of the condemnation suit it is such now, for nothing has occurred in the meantime to change its status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That some of the contracts before mentioned were entered into before the statute was adopted or the order made is not material. A common carrier cannot by making contracts for future transportation or by mortgaging its property or pledging its income prevent or postpone the exertion by the state of the power to regulate the carrier's rates and practices. Nor does the contract clause of the Constitution interpose any obstacle to the exertion of that power. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy R. R. Co. v. Iowa, 94 U. S. 155, 162, 24 L.
