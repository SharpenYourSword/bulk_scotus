Within thirty days after taking possession the receiver shall formulate and report to this court full and complete plans for prospecting such lands and developing and producing the oil and gas within the same; and until such report is made and acted upon by the court the receiver shall operate the existing oil and gas wells on said lands, or permit them to be operated by their respective claimants under his direction and supervision, or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*375</span> close down said wells if he shall deem it advisable to do so; and he shall sell at market prices the oil and gas so produced and pay out of the proceeds the necessary expenses of operation and supervision. Full and accurate accounts shall be kept by the receiver of all oil and gas so produced and of the proceeds derived from their sale and the expenses paid therefrom; and these accounts shall be kept in such way that they will show separately the production, proceeds and expenses pertaining to each well so that the net proceeds may be ultimately awarded to the rightful claimant.</p>\n<p>5. Before entering upon his duties the receiver shall execute a bond to be approved by the court in the sum of One Hundred Thousand Dollars for the faithful performance of his duties including the disbursement and payment according to the court's direction of all moneys which may come into his hands in the course of the receivership.</p>\n<p>6. The receiver shall receive such compensation for his services as may be fixed hereafter by the court.</p>\n<p>7. The defendant, the State of Texas, and the complainant, the State of Oklahoma, and their respective officers, agents and employees, and all persons now in possession of any of the said lands or claiming any right, title or interest therein, are directed to deliver possession thereof to the said receiver and are enjoined until the further order of this court from removing any of the property hereinbefore described from said lands and from conducting any oil or gas mining operations thereon save under the direction and supervision of the receiver and from interfering with the possession, control or operations of the receiver.</p>\n<p>8. As to such of the land before described as is not claimed by the defendant, the State of Texas, in its proprietary capacity said State shall have fifteen days within which to file a response to the intervener's motion for an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*376</span> injunction and receiver; and on the filing of such response the State of Texas or any claimant claiming under a patent lease or permit from that State shall be at liberty to request any modification of this order deemed essential or appropriate for the right or full protection of the interest of such State or claimant.</p>\n<p>9. Either the plaintiff, the State of Oklahoma, or the intervener, the United States, may by an amendment of its pleading make any claimant claiming under the State of Texas or any other claimant a party to the cause and have the requisite process issued and served, so that all parties claiming an interest in the subject-matter may be before the court. And the like permission is granted to the State of Texas in respect of parties claiming under the State of Oklahoma or the United States.</p>\n</div>", "id": 99555, "judges": "", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/99555/", "sha1": "419686687523807f3e850da74f289e7cda3637e9", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:47:14"}
