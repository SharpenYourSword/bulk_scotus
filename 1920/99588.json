This contention the District Court ruled against and the Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of, and constitutes the question in the case.

The question was not whether the applicant was      legally admitted in 1896-1897 or 1906. The question was      whether he had been a merchant in the United States at least      one year before his departure from the United States in 1912.      Chin Fong v. Backus, 241 U. S. 1-5, 36 Sup.

S. 552, 38 Sup. Ct. 207, 62 L. Ed. 466, we had occasion to consider the difference between the situation of a Chinese person in the United States, and one seeking to enter it; and held that the former was entitled to a judicial inquiry and determination of his rights, and that the latter was subject to executive action and decision. We think the distinction is applicable here, and that one who has been in the United States and has departed from it with the intention of returning, is entitled under existing legislation to have his right to do so judicially investigated with 'its assurances and sanctions,' as contrasted with the discretion which may prompt or the latitude of judgment which may be exercised in executive action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And such is the provision of the Act of November 3, 1893 (28 Stat. 7).

That intention it is urged, should not be ascribed to the laws, and in emphasis, it &#167;  said, 'such a legislative absurdity is unthinkable.'
