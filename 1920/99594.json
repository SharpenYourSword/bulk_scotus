Being opposed, the motion was denied&#8212;March 24, 1918. The court said of it:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'This was a motion for a 'decision on the merits of this      cause' by this court under the following circumstances: A      suit was brought in the District Court for the Southern      District of New York for an injunction for infringement of a      copyright, and of a patent, and for unfair competition in the      manufacture of a mechanical toy in absolute imitation of the      plaintiff's. The plaintiff applied for and got an injunction pendente lite [241 Fed. 133], from which the      defendant appealed. That appeal is still pending undetermined      in this court. Meanwhile the plaintiff had in the District      Court required the defendant to answer certain      interrogatories, by which it appeared that the defendant      procured from one Wagner the toys which it sold in alleged      unfair competition and in violation of the patent, and also      the 'manuals' which went with the toys and explained their      uses, which are alleged to infringe the copyright. The      interrogatories further showed that Wagner had agreed to hold      the defendant harmless for any sales of the toys and manuals,      and that in pursuance of that undertaking he had taken a      share in the defense of this suit. While it did not appear      exactly what that share was, it may be assumed, for the      purpose of the motion only, that Wagner has assumed the chief      conduct of the case, and that the defendant remains only      formally represented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The plaintiff sued Wagner in Ohio upon the three same causes      of equity and obti ned a decree upon all. Later an appeal was      taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,      and the decree was affirmed except as to the patent, which      was declared invalid, and which the plaintiff has now      withdrawn from this suit. No final decree has been entered,      and the Ohio cause now stands for an accounting in the      District Court. This motion is upon the record in the Ohio      suit, which is made a part of the moving papers, and it      presupposes that this court may pass a final decree for the      plaintiff upon the appeal from the injunction pendente lite,      upon the assumption that that record is a complete estoppel      against the defendant here and leaves open no issues for      determination between the parties.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'We pass the question of practice whether this court, under      the doctrine of Mast, Foos &amp; Co. v.

Co., supra, was a case where the bill was dismissed, and      no case has so far held that the plaintiff could obtain an      affirmative decree. As we think the motion must be denied      upon the merits, we leave open the question whether the      plaintiff may in any event so terminate the litigation. * * *      It is apparent that some of the issues are different from      those litigated in Ohio; they involve, not only the      defendant's rights to sell Wagner's toys and manuals, but any      others which it may procure elsewhere. * * * At best the rule      in Mast, Foos &amp; Co. v. Stover Mfg. Co., supra, is limited to      those cases in which the court can see that the whole issues      can be disposed of at once without injustice to the parties.

After stating that the trial court very naturally followed the Ohio District Court, it referred to the partial reversal of the decree there announced and expressed entire agreement with the Circuit Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, in holding the patent invalid. And, having considered the evidence relating to copyright and unfair competition, it found no adequate ground for an injunction. 250 Fed. 450, 162 C. C. A. 386. The cause comes here by certiorari.

This power is not limited to mere consideration of, and action upon, the order appealed from; but, if insuperable objection to maintaining the bill clearly appears, it may be dismissed and the litigation terminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The correct general doctrine is that whether a preliminary injunction shall be awarded rests in sound discretion of the trial court. Upon appeal, an order granting or denying such an injunction will not be disturbed, unless contrary to some rule of equity, or the result of improvident exercise of judicial discretion. Rahley v. Columbia Phonograph Co., 122 Fed. 623, 58 C. C. A. 639; Tea &#167; Traction Co. v. Barron G. Collier, Inc., 195 Fed. 65, 66, 115 C. C. A. 82; Southern Express Co. v. Long et al., 202 Fed. 462, 120 C.

On such an appeal a cause may be dismissed if it clearly appears that no ground exists for equitable relief; but finally to decide a defendant's rights upon the mere statement of his adversary, although apparently supported by ex parte affidavits and decrees of other courts, is not within the purview of the act. He is entitled to a day in court with opportunity to set up and establish his defenses. The motion for final judgment was properly overruled. Eagle Glass &amp; Manufacturing Co. v.

The interrogatories further showed that Wagner had agreed to hold the defendant harmless for any sales of the toys and manuals, and that in pursuance of that undertaking he had taken a share in the defense of this suit. While it did not appear exactly what that share was, it may be assumed for the purposes of the motion only, that Wagner has assumed the chief conduct of the case and that the defendant remains only formally represented.</p>\n<p>\"The plaintiff sued Wagner in Ohio upon the three same causes of equity and obtained a decree upon all. Later an appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and the decree was affirmed except as to the patent, which was declared invalid and which the plaintiff has now withdrawn from this suit. No final decree has been entered and the Ohio cause now stands for an accounting in the district court. This motion is upon the record in the Ohio suit which is made a part of the moving papers and it presupposes that this court may pass a final decree for the plaintiff upon the appeal from the injunction <i>pendente lite</i> upon the assumption that that record is a complete estoppel against the defendant here and leaves open no issues for determination between the parties.\"</p>\n<p>\"We pass the question of practice whether this court under the doctrine of <i>Mast, Foos &amp; Co.</i> v. <i>Stover,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></span>, may enter a decree for the plaintiff upon such <span class=\"star-pagination\">*140</span> an appeal as that now pending. <i>Mast, Foos &amp; Co.</i> v. <i>Stover, supra</i><i>,</i> was a case where the bill was dismissed and no case has so far held that the plaintiff could obtain an affirmative decree. As we think the motion must be denied upon the merits, we leave open the question whether the plaintiff may in any event so terminate the litigation. . . . It is apparent that some of the issues are different from those litigated in Ohio; they involve not only the defendant's rights to sell Wagner's toys and manuals, but any others which it may procure elsewhere. . . . At best the rule in <i>Mast, Foos &amp; Co.</i> v. <i>Stover, supra</i><i>,</i> is limited to those cases in which the court can see that the whole issues can be disposed of at once without injustice to the parties. Whatever may be the result here, it is apparent that the case involves more than can be so decided.\"</p>\n<p>April 15, 1918, the court below reversed the challenged preliminary order. After stating that the trial court very naturally followed the Ohio District Court, it referred to the partial reversal of the decree there announced and expressed entire agreement with the Circuit Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, in holding the patent invalid. And, having considered the evidence relating to copyright and unfair competition, it found no adequate ground for an injunction. 250 Fed. Rep. 450. The cause comes here by certiorari. See <i>Ex parte Wagner,</i> 249 U.S. 465.</p>\n<p>Decrees by Circuit Courts of Appeals are declared final by § 128, Judicial Code, in cases like the present one. We, therefore, had authority to bring this cause up by certiorari and may treat it as if here on appeal. Section 240, Judicial Code; <i>Harriman</i> v. <i>Northern Securities Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96248\"><a href=\"/opinion/96248/harriman-v-northern-securities-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span>, 287; <i>Denver</i> v. <i>New York Trust Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97904\"><a href=\"/opinion/97904/city-and-county-of-denver-v-new-york-trust-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span>, 136. The power of Circuit Courts of Appeals to review preliminary orders granting injunctions arises from § 129, Judicial Code, which has been often considered. <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Vulcan Iron Works,</i> 165 U.S. 518; <span class=\"star-pagination\">*141</span> <i>Mast, Foos &amp; Co.</i> v. <i>Stover Manufacturing Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95259\"><a href=\"/opinion/95259/mast-foos-co-v-stover-mfg-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></a></span>, 494; <i>Harriman</i> v. <i>Northern Securities Co., supra</i><i>; </i><i>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co.</i> v. <i>Bray,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97654\"><a href=\"/opinion/97654/united-states-fidelity-guaranty-co-v-bray/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span>, 214; <i>Denver</i> v. <i>New York Trust Co., supra</i><i>.</i> This power is not limited to mere consideration of, and action upon, the order appealed from; but, if insuperable objection to maintaining the bill clearly appears, it may be dismissed and the litigation terminated.</p>\n<p>The correct general doctrine is that whether a preliminary injunction shall be awarded rests in sound discretion of the trial court. Upon appeal, an order granting or denying such an injunction will not be disturbed unless contrary to some rule of equity, or the result of improvident exercise of judicial discretion. <i>Rahley</i> v. <i>Columbia Phonograph Co.,</i> 122 Fed. Rep. 623; <i>Texas Traction Co.</i> v. <i>Barron G. Collier, Inc.,</i> 195 Fed. Rep. 65, 66; <i>Southern Express Co.</i> v. <i>Long,</i> 202 Fed.

The informed judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals exercised upon a view of all relevant circumstances is entitled to great weight. And, except for strong reasons, this court will not interfere with its action. No such reasons are presented by the present record.</p>\n<p>Pending the New York appeal the situation underwent a radical change  the Circuit Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, reversed the decree upholding petitioner's patent. Evidently the trial court had granted the preliminary injunction in entire reliance upon that decree and after its reversal the court below properly took notice of and considered the changed circumstances. <i>Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Ry.

But the appeal was from an interlocutory order and the court could only exercise powers given by statute. On such an appeal a cause may be dismissed if it clearly appears that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*142</span> no ground exists for equitable relief; but finally to decide a defendant's rights upon the mere statement of his adversary, although apparently supported by <i>ex parte</i> affidavits and decrees of other courts, is not within the purview of the act. He is entitled to a day in court with opportunity to set up and establish his defenses. The motion for final judgment was properly overruled. <i>Eagle Glass &amp; Manufacturing Co.</i> v. <i>Rowe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99038\"><a href=\"/opinion/99038/eagle-glass-mfg-co-v-rowe/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span>, 281.</p>\n<p>Petitioner's motion to enter a disclaimer must be denied.</p>\n<p>If the two Circuit Courts of Appeals have expressed conflicting views we cannot now declare which is right or undertake finally to decide the several issues involved upon their merits. The matter for review here is the action of the courts below upon the preliminary order for injunction and we may go no further. <i>Leeds &amp; Catlin Co.</i> v. <i>Victor Talking Machine Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97017\"><a href=\"/opinion/97017/leeds-catlin-co-v-victor-talking-machine-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span>, 311; <i>Lutcher &amp; Moore Lumber Co.</i> v. <i>Knight,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97235\"><a href=\"/opinion/97235/lutcher-moore-lumber-co-v-knight/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 267.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.
