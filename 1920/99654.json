The aliens were detained and subsequently admitted under the act of Congress known as the Immigration Act, passed February 20, 1907 (Comp. St. &#167; 4242 et seq.). It is stated that the Secretary of Commerce and Labor and the Commissioner General of Immigration, and their subordinates, claiming to act under the authority of the Immigration Act, rendered to the petitioner from month to month bills for the hospital treatment and maintenance of the aliens so detained and subsequently admitted. Certain regulations of the Commissioner General of Immigration are cited; and it is alleged that the United States officials threatened that, if the bills were not paid, thereafter all aliens so brought to this country would be held on board ship until their application for admission to the United States should be finally adjudicated. It is set forth that on all vessels arriving in the port of New York there were aliens who were temporarily detained and subsequently admitted; that detention on board ship would have delayed the sailing of petitioner's vessels from periods varying from a few days to several weeks. The threats were actually carried out, at least in one instance, and if vessels were so detained the result would have been not merely great inconvenience and financial loss to the petitioner, but a complete disruption of oceanic commerce in the port of New York and the United States.

United States, 182 U. S. 222, 21 Sup. Ct. 762, 45 L. Ed. 1074. In Basso v. United States, 239 U. S. 602, 36 Sup. Ct. 226, 60 L. Ed. 462, suit was brought in the Court of Claims for the illegal arrest and imprisonment of the claimant upon a charge of having imported goods from the United States into Porto Rico without having made entry of the same under an act of Congress which the appellant alleged was not in force in Porto Rico. It was alleged that the court was without jurisdiction, and that therefore the trial, conviction, and sentence of imprisonment deprived him of his liberty without due process of law in violation of the Constitution. The United States filed a general traverse of the petition, and subsequently moved to dismiss upon the ground that the court had no jurisdiction as the action sounded in tort. This motion was sustained in the Court of Claims, and an appeal taken to this court. Speaking of the contention of the appellant that the Court of Claims had jurisdiction, this court said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'He, however, contends that the Court of Claims has      jurisdiction under the Tucker Act over claims ex delicto      founded upon the Constitution of the United States. And this,      he further contends, is supported by the recent decisions of      this court, and relies especially upon Dooley v. United      States, 182 U. S. 222.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'But that case did not overrule Schillinger v. United States,      155 U.

We are not disposed to overrule the      case, either directly or by implication. * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The Dooley Case and cases subsequent to it which are relied      upon by the appellant concerned the exaction of duties or      taxes by the United States or its officers or property taken      by the government for public purposes. In such cases      jurisdiction in the Court of Claims for the recovery of the      duties and taxes or for the value of the property taken was      declared.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'In the case at bar (assuming as true all that is charged)      there was a wrong inflicted, if a wrong can be said to have      been inflicted by the sentence of a court legally constituted      after judgment upon issues openly framed by the opposing      parties both of fact and the applicable law, whether that law      was sections 2865 and 3082 of the Revised Statutes or the      Constitution of the United States. But, conceding that a      wrong was inflicted through these judicial forms, the case      nevertheless is of different character from the Dooley CASE, AS WAS ALSO THE SCHILLINGER CASE. thE latter case      passed uPon the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims in      actions founded on tort and declared the general principle to      be, based on a policy by imposed necessity, that governments      are not liable (155 U. S. 167) 'for unauthorized wrongs      inflicted on the citizen by their officers, though occurring      while engaged in the discharge of official duties.' And it      was further said (page 168): 'Congress has wisely reserved to      itself the right to give or withhold relief where the claim      is founded on wrongful proceedings of an officer of the      government.'

Following the well-established construction of the Tucker Act, as declared in many cases in this court, we think that the Court of Claims should have dismissed the petition because it presented a claim not within its jurisdiction. The judgment of the Court of Claims is reversed, and the cause remanded to that court, with instructions to dismiss the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "", "html_with_citations": "<p class=\"case_cite\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></span></p>\n    <p class=\"case_cite\">41 S.Ct. 72</p>\n    <p class=\"case_cite\">65 L.Ed. 193</p>\n    <p class=\"parties\">UNITED STATES<br>v.<br>NEDERLANDSCH-AMERIKAANSCHE STOOMVART MAATSCHAPPIJ  (HOLLAND-AMERICAN LINE).</p>\n    <p class=\"docket\">No. 53.</p>\n    <p class=\"date\">Argued Jan. 28, 1920.</p>\n    <div class=\"prelims\">\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restored to Docket for Reargument Oct. 11, 1920.</p>\n      <p>Reargued Nov. 17, 1920.</p>\n      <p>Decided Dec. 6, 1920.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Assistant Attorney General Davis,</i> for the United States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Messrs.

We are not disposed to overrule the      case, either directly or by implication. * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The Dooley Case and cases subsequent to it which are relied      upon by the appellant concerned the exaction of duties or      taxes by the United States or its officers or property taken      by the government for public purposes. In such cases      jurisdiction in the Court of Claims for the recovery of the      duties and taxes or for the value of the property taken was      declared.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'In the case at bar (assuming as true all that is charged)      there was a wrong inflicted, if a wrong can be said to have      been inflicted by the sentence of a court legally constituted      after judgment upon issues openly framed by the opposing      parties both of fact and the applicable law, whether that law      was sections 2865 and 3082 of the Revised Statutes or the      Constitution of the United States. But, conceding that a      wrong was inflicted through these judicial forms, the case      nevertheless is of different character from the Dooley CASE, AS WAS ALSO THE SCHILLINGER CASE. thE latter case      passed uPon the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims in      actions founded on tort and declared the general principle to      be, based on a policy by imposed necessity, that governments      are not liable (155 U. S. 167) 'for unauthorized wrongs      inflicted on the citizen by their officers, though occurring      while engaged in the discharge of official duties.' And it      was further said (page 168): 'Congress has wisely reserved to      itself the right to give or withhold relief where the claim      is founded on wrongful proceedings of an officer of the      government.'

Following the well-established construction of the Tucker Act, as declared in many cases in this court, we think that the Court of Claims should have dismissed the petition because it presented a claim not within its jurisdiction. The judgment of the Court of Claims is reversed, and the cause remanded to that court, with instructions to dismiss the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "id": 99654, "judges": "", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/99654/", "sha1": "21846d85ec54f7788bc6cb9ae42651823c5d9042", "source": "R", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:47:16"}
