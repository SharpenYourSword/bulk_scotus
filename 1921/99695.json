As originally constructed it turned sharply southeastward at Hayti, Mo.&#8212;220 miles from St. Louis&#8212;ran thence 7 miles to Caruthersville, a city of 4,000 people, thence southwestward 9 miles to Grassy Bayou, and thence south. A 'cut-off' between Hayti and Grassy Bayou&#8212;6 miles&#8212;became part of the main line in 1904, and thereafter through freight and night passenger trains passed that way. The through day passenger trains Nos. 801 and 802&#8212;continued to move along the old line until August, 1913, when they were routed over the 'cut-off.' At the same time two new daily passenger trains were put on and operated between Blytheville, Ark., and Cape Girardeau, Mo., by way of Caruthersville.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Missouri Public Service Commission directed the railway company to restore trains 801 and 802 to the route followed prior to 1913 and the state Supreme Court approved this action. We are asked to declare the order invalid because it unduly burdens interstate commerce. The point is well taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourteen local daily passenger trains move in and out of Caruthersville&#8212;seven each way. Some of these make close connections with all through trains at Hayti. These locals do not carry equipment of the highest class, but apparently they afford fair facilities for reaching and leaving Caruthersville without serious delay or great inconvenience. If deficient in schedule or equipment, there is an easy remedy by means other than detours of the through trains.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The applicable general doctrine has been often considered and in Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Ry. Co. v. Wisconsin R. R. Commission, 237 U. S. 220, 226, 35 Sup. Ct. 560, 562 (59 L.

(2) Such facilities existing&#8212;that is, the local conditions      being adequately met&#8212;the obligation of the railroad is      performed, and the stoppage of interstate trains becomes an      improper and illegal interference with interstate commerce.      (3) And this, whether the interference be directly by the      Legislature or by its command through the orders of an      administrative body. (4) The fact of local facilities this      court may determine, such fact being necessarily in volved in the determination of the federal question whether an order      concerning an interstate train does or does not directly      regulate interstate commerce, by imposing an arbitrary      requirement.
