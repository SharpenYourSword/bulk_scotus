The government does not press the case on count 2. It is only necessary, therefore, to consider count 1. It charges defendant with unlawfully and corruptly endeavoring to influence one William D. Russell, who, he well knew, was a petit juror in the court in the discharge of his, the juror's duty, and who he knew had been summoned as a petit juror on April 3, 1918, at which time the trial of William D. Haywood and others was to begin.

Haywood and his codefendants, and corruptly to      induce said William D. Russell to favor the acquittal of said      William D. Haywood and his codefendants in case he should be      selected as a petit juror at said trial, said L. C. Russell,      on said April 1, 1918, called at the home of said William D.      Russell at No. 604 West Thirty-First street, in said city of      Chicago, and engaged Lucy Russell, wife of said William D.      Russell, in a conversation, in the course of which said L. C.      Russell told said Lucy Russell that he represented said      William D. Haywood and his codefendants and requested her to      question her husband as to his attitude towards said William      D. Maywood and his codefendants in the matter of the charges      contained in said indictment and report the result of such      questioning to him, the said L. C. Russell, because, as said      L. C. Russell then and there stated to said Lucy Russell,      they (meaning said William D. Haywood and his codefendants)      did not want to pay money to any of the petit jurors sitting      at the trial of said case unless they knew such petit jurors      would favor their acquittal; by means of which request and      statement said L.

Criminality does not get rid of its evil quality by the precautions it takes against consequences, personal or pecuniary. It is a somewhat novel excuse to urge that Russell's action was not criminal, because he was cautious enough to consider its cost and be sure of its success. The section, however, is not directed at success in corrupting a juror, but at the 'endeavor' to do so. Experimental approaches to the corruption of a juror are the 'endeavor' of the section.
