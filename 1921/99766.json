The idea that income is realized by conversion of capital which has increased in value is evidently due to a confusion of ideas in two particulars: first, the fact that a merchant or trader realizes income only when he sells the property in which he trades suggests the idea that any sale, when increase in value has already occurred, must likewise <span class=\"star-pagination\">*524</span> produce income; second, it has been assumed that an accounting practice in recording capital values was based on a distinction between capital and income, when in fact it is not.</p>\n<p>Prior to the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment both English and American courts had definitely decided that the sale of capital investments at an advance over cost did not produce income. A winding-up sale does not involve a conversion of two investments, one an investment of the corporation and another an investment of the stockholders. The authorities sustain the contention that on a winding-up sale by a corporation the investment sold is the investment of the stockholders, and that any prior increase in the value of the property sold was an increase in the value of their investment. <i>Lynch</i> v. <i>Turrish,</i> 247 U.S. 221, 228; <i>Collector</i> v. <i>Hubbard,</i> 12 Wall. 1; <i>Bailey</i> v. <i>Railroad Co.,</i> 22 Wall. 604, 635, 636; <i>Tebrau Rubber Syndicate, Ltd.,</i> v. <i>Farmer</i> (1909), 5 Tax Cases, 658.</p>\n<p>The income tax provisions of neither the Act of March 2, 1867, nor the Act of October 3, 1913, imposed any tax on a realized increase in the value of capital assets. <i>Gray</i> v. <i>Darlington,</i> 15 Wall. 63; <i>Lynch</i> v. <i>Turrish,</i> 247 U.S. 221; <i>Maryland Casualty Co.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 251 U.S. 342.</p>\n<p>The provisions of the Revenue Acts of 1916 and 1917 which define the property on which the income and excess profits taxes are imposed are substantially the same as the corresponding provisions of the Acts of 1867 and 1913.</p>\n<p>No rulings of the Treasury Department can affect the duty of the court to give the same interpretation, in this respect, to the Revenue Acts of 1916 and 1917 as to the Acts of 1867 and 1913.</p>\n<p>Neither the new provisions of the Revenue Act of 1916 making the March 1, 1913, value the basis for computing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*525</span> gain or loss \"from the sale or other disposition\" of property, nor the new provision in that act with regard to losses of individuals, serve to make the scope of the Revenue Acts of 1916 and 1917 any broader, as to realized increases in the value of capital assets, than the Act of 1867 or the Act of 1913.</p>\n<p>All doubts respecting the scope and meaning of a tax statute are to be resolved in favor of the taxpayer. <i>Gould</i> v. <i>Gould,</i> 245 U.S. 151; <i>Crocker</i> v. <i>Malley,</i> 249 U.S. 223, 233.</p>\n<p>A statute must be so construed, if fairly possible, as not only to avoid the conclusion that it is unconstitutional but even grave doubts upon that score. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Jin Fuey Moy,</i> 241 U.S. 394, 401; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Delaware &amp; Hudson Co.,</i> 213 U.S. 366, 408.</p>\n<p><i>The Solicitor General</i> for defendant in error.</p>\n<p>MR.
