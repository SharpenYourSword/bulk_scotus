She claimed under the federal Employers' Liability Act (Comp. St. &#167;&#167; 8657-8665). Verdict and judgment having been entered for her, an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of the state, and reversal sought upon several grounds. That court considered only one question&#8212;Did decedent's death result from a risk which he assumed as the result of his employment? And, concluding that he had assumed such risk, it reversed the judgment of the trial court, and entered one for respondent non obstante veredicto. 267 Pa. 86, 110 Atl. 254. As found and stated by the Supreme Court, the facts are these: 'Decedent was a member of a crew which had brought a           train from Philadelphia to South Bethlehem. Some of the           cars contained goods shipped in interstate commerce.           When all the cars were released at their appropriate           places, the engine went back to get the caboose for the           purpose of taking it to the point where it was to stay           until wanted for further traffic, and then itself go to           the roundhouse where it was to remain until again           needed. This movement was through defendant's yard,           where there were a number of tracks upon which cars and           locomotives were being shifted constantly. Through the           yard ran also the main passenger tracks of defendant,           and, at the points where other tracks crossed over or           connected therewith, derailing devices had been wisely           installed for the purpose of preventing locomotives and           cars using the other tracks from running on to or over           the passenger tracks, at a time when passenger trains           were standing or traveling thereon, and thereby possibly           causing collision and serious loss of life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The engine and caboose which had reached South Bethlehem      were moving over a track which had one of those derailing      devices where it connected with the passenger tracks. The      caboose being in front of the locomotive the engineer could      not see the device when operating the engine from his cab and      hence decedent was directed to and did locate himself on the      front of the caboose, with a duty to signal the engineer in      time for him to safely stop if the derailing device was set      against further passage. It was so set on this occasion, but      either through the negligence of decedent himself, or of the      engineer in failing to notice or heed the signaling of      decedent, the locomotive did not stop in time, the caboose      was derailed and decedent was crushed to death between it and      cars on an adjoining track.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accepting the view that the engineer's negligence was the proximate cause of the fatal injury, the court below held the decedent had assumed the risk of such negligence and the master was not liable, citing among other cases Seaboard Air Line v.
