Section 7306.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant adduces against the validity of section 7306, the provision of section 2 of article 4 of the Constitution of the United States that 'the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states,' and the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment which declare that no state shall 'make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States' or 'deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law' or 'deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dower is not a prvilege or immunity of citizenship, either state or federal, within the meaning of the provisions relied on. At most it is a right which, while it exists, is attached to the marital contract or relation, and it always has been deemed subject to regulation by each state as respects property within its limits. Conner v. Elliot, 18 How. 591, 15 L. Ed. 497. Neither section 2 of article 4 nor the Fourteenth Amendment takes from the several states the power to regulate this subject; nor does either make it a privilege or immunity of citizenship. Maxwell v. Bugbee, 250 U. S. 525, 537, 538, 40 Sup. Ct. 2, 63 L. Ed. 1124, and cases cited; United States v. Wheeler, 254 U. S. 281, 296, 41 Sup. Ct. 133, 65 L. Ed. 270.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The further contention, based on the Fourteenth Amendment, necessarily is, as counsel urged, that dower is 'fundamental and substantial'&#8212;'a property right, being, while inchoate, a chose in action, of which no citizen of the United States, wherever he [she] may be resident can be deprived without 'due process of law,' and as to which every person is entitled to the 'equal protection of the laws' as provided in the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Circuit Court of Appeals (268 Fed. 117) considered this contention, and it is difficult to add anything to its opinion. It pointed out that the Oregon statute was taken from the laws of Michigan adopted in 1846 and sustained.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The example of Michigan was followed in Wisconsin, Kansas, and Nebraska, and sustained by the courts of those states.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the decisions of those courts we may add Thornburn v. Doscher (U. S. Circuit Court for Oregon) 32 Fed. 810, which sustained the Oregon statute, as did the Supreme Court of Oregon in Cunningham v. Friendly, 70 Or. 222, 139 Pac. 928, 140 Pac. 989. And we may add also Richards v. Bellingham Bay Land Co., 54 Fed. 209, 4 C. C. A. 290, which decided to be legal a like statute of the state of Washington. And Blackstone speaks of dower as having become 'a great clog to alienation' and 'otherwise inconvenient to families.' 1 Washburn on Real Property (5th Ed.) 278, in note.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cases recognize that the limitation of the dower right is to remove an impediment to the transfer of real estate and to assure titles against absent and probably unknown wives. And such is the purpose of the Oregon statute, and the means of executing the purpose appropriate, and a proper exercise of classification. It satisfies, therefore, the constitutional requirement of the equal protection of the laws; and we proceed to the inquiry whether the statute is otherwise valid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's contention is that though she be living in New York, it is her privilege under the Fourteenth Amendment to resist the law of Oregon as a limitation of her dower rights, that is, a limitation of rights in property situated in Oregon. The contention might be tenable if the Legislature of a state was required to grant dower rights. As repellant of that proposition, the difference the laws of the states exhibit in the rights that attach to the marriage relation may be adduced. The states greatly differ as to what lands are dowable, and as to what claims are paramount to dower, and to some extent, how it will be barred. 4 Kent, 35 et seq.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The granting of dower, therefore, is a matter of statutory regulation. It was so decided by the United States Circuit Court of Oregon in 1887 (Thornburn v. Doscher, supra); Judge Deady expressing it as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'It rests with the Legislature to say what interest, if any,      married persons shall have in the property of each other, as an      incident of the relation between them. It may give or      withhold dower altogether; or it may for the security of      titles, and the protection of innocent purchasers, provide      that a nonresident woman whose very existence is probably      unknown within the state, and is practically disavowed by the      husband, shall not be entitled to dower of lands which he has      disposed of without her concurrence or consent, and      ostensibly as a single man.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law thus declared has been the law of Oregon for 65 years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a distinction between dower created by the parties and that given by law and the latter 'it is believed to be the only kind which ever obtained in this country.' Randall v. Kreiger, 23 Wall. 137, 148 (23 L. Ed. 124). Expressing the power of the Legislature over it the court said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'During the life of the husband the right is a mere      expectancy or possibility. In that condition of things, the      law making power may deal with it as may be deemed proper. It      is not a natural right. It is wholly given by law, and the      power that gave it may increase, diminish, or otherwise alter      it, or wholly take it away. It is upon the same footing with      the expectancy of heirs, apparent or presumptive, before the      death of the ancestor. Until that event occurs the law of      descent and distribution may be molded according to the will      to the Legislature.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ruling is a deduction or incident of the more general principle expressed in Kerr v.

Neither § 2 of Article IV nor the Fourteenth Amendment takes from the several States the power to regulate this subject; nor does either make it a privilege or immunity of citizenship. <i>Maxwell</i> v. <i>Bugbee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99449\"><a href=\"/opinion/99449/maxwell-v-bugbee/\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span>, 537, 538, and cases cited; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Wheeler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99670\"><a href=\"/opinion/99670/united-states-v-wheeler/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span>, 296.</p>\n<p>The further contention based on the Fourteenth Amendment necessarily is, as counsel urge, that dower is \"fundamental and substantial\"  \"a property right, being, while inchoate, a chose in action, of which no citizen of the United States, wherever he [she] may be resident, can be deprived without `due process of law,' and as to which every person is entitled to the `equal protection of the laws,' as provided in the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.\"</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals considered this contention, and it is difficult to add anything to its opinion. It pointed out that the Oregon statute was taken from the laws of Michigan adopted in 1846 and sustained.<sup>[1]</sup> The example of Michigan was followed in Wisconsin, Kansas and Nebraska and sustained by the courts of those States.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*319</span> To the decisions of those courts we may add <i>Thornburn</i> v. <i>Doscher,</i> U.S. Circuit Court for Oregon, 32 Fed. 810, which sustained the Oregon statute as did the Supreme Court of Oregon in <i>Cunningham</i> v. <i>Friendly,</i> 70 Ore. 222. And we may add also <i>Richards</i> v. <i>Bellingham Bay Land Co.,</i> 54 Fed. 209, which decided to be legal a like statute of the State of Washington. And Blackstone speaks of dower as having become \"a great clog to alienation\" and \"otherwise inconvenient to families.\" 1 Washburn on Real Property, 5th ed., 278, in note.</p>\n<p>The cases recognize that the limitation of the dower right is to remove an impediment to the transfer of real estate and to assure titles against absent and probably unknown wives. And such is the purpose of the Oregon statute, and the means of executing the purpose appropriate, and a proper exercise of classification. It satisfies, therefore, the constitutional requirement of the equal protection of the laws; and we proceed to the inquiry whether the statute is otherwise valid.</p>\n<p>Appellant's contention is that, though she be living in New York, it is her privilege under the Fourteenth Amendment to resist the law of Oregon as a limitation of her dower rights, that is a limitation of rights in property situated in Oregon. The contention might be tenable if the legislature of a State was required to grant dower rights. As repellent of that proposition, the difference the laws of the States exhibit in the rights that attach to the marriage relation may be adduced. The States greatly differ as to what lands are dowable, and as to what claims are paramount to dower, and to some extent, how it will be barred. 4 Kent, p. 35, <i>et seq.</i></p>\n<p>The granting of dower, therefore, is a matter of statutory regulation. It was so decided by the United States Circuit Court of Oregon in 1887 (<i>Thornburn</i> v. <i>Doscher, supra</i>), Judge Deady expressing it as follows: \"It rests with the legislature to say what interest, if any, married <span class=\"star-pagination\">*320</span> persons shall have in the property of each other, as an incident of the relation between them. It may give or withhold dower altogether. Or it may for the security of titles, and the protection of innocent purchasers, provide that a nonresident woman whose very existence is probably unknown within the state, and is practically disavowed by the husband, shall not be entitled to dower of lands which he has disposed of without her concurrence or consent, and ostensibly as a single man.\" The law thus declared has been the law of Oregon for 65 years.</p>\n<p>There is a distinction between dower created by the parties and that given by law, and the latter \"is believed to be the only kind which ever obtained in this country.\" <i>Randall</i> v. <i>Kreiger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"89104\"><a href=\"/opinion/89104/randall-v-kreiger/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, 148. Expressing the power of the legislature over it, the court said, \"during the life of the husband the right is a mere expectancy or possibility. In that condition of things, the law-making power may deal with it as may be deemed proper. It is not a natural right. It is wholly given by law, and the power that gave it may increase, diminish, or otherwise alter it, or wholly take it away. It is upon the same footing with the expectancy of heirs, apparent or presumptive, before the death of the ancestor. Until that event occurs the law of descent and distribution may be moulded according to the will of the legislature.\"</p>\n<p>The ruling is a deduction or incident of the more general principle expressed in <i>Kerr</i> v. <i>Moon,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></span>, 570, \"that the title to, and the disposition of real property, must be exclusively subject to the laws of the country where it is situated.\" And this was so considered and the case cited in <i>Thomas</i> v. <i>Woods,</i> 173 Fed. 585, 593, along with a number of other cases, to sustain the court in the declaration and decision that \"the right of dower in real property is determined by the laws of the state in which the property is situated.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*321</span> From these cases it results, as said by the Circuit Court of Appeals, that \"the legislature having this power to give or withhold dower, it follows that it has the power to declare the manner in which the dower right may be barred, or the grounds upon which it may be forfeited, and, if so, it has the right to provide that it may be barred by the wife's nonresidence in the State.\"</p>\n<p>The action of the court affirming the decree of the District Court is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  <i>Pratt</i> v. <i>Tefft,</i> 14 Mich. 191; <i>Ligare</i> v. <i>Semple,</i> 32 Mich. 438; <i>Bear</i> v. <i>Stahl,</i> 61 Mich. 203.</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>Bennett</i> v. <i>Harms,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wis.</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></span>, <i>Ekegren</i> v. <i>Marcotte,</i> 159 Wis. 539; <i>Atkins</i> v. <i>Atkins,</i> 18 Neb. 474; <i>Miner</i> v. <i>Morgan,</i> 83 Neb. 400; <i>Buffington</i> v. <i>Grosvenor,</i> 46 Kan. 730.</p>\n\n</div>", "id": 99955, "judges": "McKenna", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/99955/", "sha1": "ed2692f5148b866d36d23ffa99e8991e2d271068", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:47:21"}
