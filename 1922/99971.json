The sufficient answer to this contention that the specifications do not charge any crime known to the laws of the United States is that section 284 of the federal Criminal Code (Comp.

Hyde, Company `K', 31st Infantry, acting jointly and in pursuance of a common intent, did, at Vladivostok, Siberia, on or about the 14th day of January, 1920, by putting him in fear, feloniously take from the presence of Van Fun Un, 40 Koreaskays Street, Vladivostok, Siberia, the sum of about ten thousand (10,000) Roubles, value about Fifty Dollars ($50.00).\"</p>\n<p>The second and third specifications differ from the first only in the name and place of residence in Vladivostok of the person robbed and as to the value of the property taken.</p>\n<p>The argument in support of the contention of the petitioner is that the allegation that the property was taken \"from the presence of\" the persons named does not imply that it was taken unlawfully from the presence, possession or custody of another or that it was not at the time the property of the accused.</p>\n<p>The jurisdiction of the court martial was derived from the act of Congress embodying the Articles of War which, it is declared, shall, at all times and in all places, govern the Armies of the United States (39 Stat. 650, 670), and the charge of robbery was certainly framed under Article 93 thereof, providing that: \"Any person subject to military law who commits . . . robbery shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*420</span> The sufficient answer to this contention that the specifications do not charge any crime known to the laws of the United States is that § 284 of the Federal Criminal Code, providing for the punishment of robbery, reads: \"Whoever, by force and violence, or by putting in fear, shall feloniously take from the person or presence of another anything of value, shall be imprisoned not more than fifteen years.\"</p>\n<p>This has been accepted as an accurate and authoritative definition of robbery from Blackstone, Book IV, p. 243 (Cooley's ed.), to Bishop's New Criminal Law, Vol. II, §§ 1177, 1178. Taking property from the presence of another feloniously and by putting him in fear is equivalent to taking it from his personal protection and is, in law, a taking from the person. Men do not feloniously put others in fear for the purpose of seizing their own property.</p>\n<p>It is not necessary that the charge in court martial proceedings should be framed with the technical precision of a common-law indictment, and we cannot doubt that the one in this case clearly shows jurisdiction in the court over the accused and over the offense with which he was charged, and that the latter was sufficiently described to advise defendant of the time and place and circumstances under which it was claimed he had committed the crime, to enable him to make any defense he may have had.</p>\n<p>It is also charged that there was no evidence of guilt before the court-martial other than the confession of the accused, which, it is averred, was made, under oath, to and at the instance of his superior officer, under duress, whereby it is alleged he was compelled to become a witness against himself in violation of the Constitution of the United States. This, in substance, is a conclusion of the pleader, unsupported by any reference to the record and, at most, was an error in the admission of testimony, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*421</span> which cannot be reviewed in a <i>habeas corpus</i> proceeding. Cases, <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p>The remaining allegations are trivial.</p>\n<p>For the reason that the petition did not state facts sufficient to entitle petitioner to the writ of <i>habeas corpus,</i> the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 99971, "judges": "Clarke", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/99971/", "sha1": "a311ec96bdbc2f4d4eaa2a0acf515d442a06f730", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:47:22"}
