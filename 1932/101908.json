The District Court dismissed the intervening claim and adjudged a forfeiture, holding that sections 3061 and 3062 of the Revised Statutes were unrepealed by title 2, section 26, of the National Prohibition Act, and permitted the forfeiture of articles illegally employed in the importation of intoxicating liquors.
