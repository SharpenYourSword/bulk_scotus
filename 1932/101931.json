Two joint-stock associations, Planters' Cotton Oil Company, Waxahachie, and Planters' Cotton Oil Company, Ennis, which had been organized in earlier years, retained their separate existence. One man, H. N. Chapman, was the owner of 98 per cent. of the shares of the unincorporated associations.

The deduction was disallowed, and suit was brought by the corporation and the associations for the refund of the tax to the extent of the overpayment claimed. The District Court dismissed the petition (47 F.(2d) 659); the Court of Appeals affirmed (53 F.(2d) 825); and by certiorari the case is here (285 U. S. 533, 52 S. Ct. 405, 76 L.
