Mieyr v. Federal Surety Co., 94 Mont. 508, 23 P.(2d) 959. We held that under the statutes of Iowa the liquidator was the successor to the corporation, and not a mere custodian, and that in ruling to the contrary the Supreme Court of Montana had denied full faith and credit to the statutes of a sister state. 292 U.S. 112, 121, 54 S.Ct. 615, 78 L.Ed. 1160. The question was then an open one whether there was any local policy, expressed in statute or decision, whereby the title of a statutory successor was to be subordinated to later executions at the suit of local creditors. As to that question, the Supreme Court of Montana would speak the final word. 292 U.S. 112, 123, 54 S.Ct. 615, 78 L.Ed. 1160.

Montana does not challenge the standing of this foreign liquidator as successor to the dissolved corporation or as owner of its assets. On the contrary, his standing and ownership are now explicitly conceded.

The principle of these decisions applies with undiminished force to a statutory successor. In respect of his subjection to the power of the local law, his position is no better than that of the dissolved corporation to whose title he has succeeded or of its voluntary assignee upon a trust for all the creditors. He must submit, as must they, to the mandate of the sovereignty that has the physical control of what he would reduce to his possession. Cf. The Disconto Gesellschaft v.

Some states prefer a rule of equal distribution and compel the local suitor to yield to the statutory successor (Martyne v. American Union Fire Ins.

Granite State Provident Association, 161 N.Y. 492, 55 N.E. 1053). Other states give the local creditor a free hand, with the result that he may seize what he can find, though the assets of the debtor are dismembered in the process. Lackmann v.

Choice is uncontrolled, as between one policy and the other, so far as the Constitution of the Nation has any voice upon the subject. Iowa may say that one who is a liquidator with title, appointed by her statutes, shall be so recognized in Montana with whatever rights and privileges accompany such recognition according to Montana law. For failure to give adherence to that principle, we reversed and remanded when the case was last before us. Iowa may not say, however, that a liquidator with title who goes into Montana may set at naught Montana law as to the distribution of Montana assets, and carry over into another state the rule of distribution prescribed by the statutes of the domicile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Converse v.

A statutory liquidator of a Minnesota corporation brought suit in Wisconsin against defendants there residing to enforce their personal liability as stockholders in accordance with a Minnesota statute. The only question was whether the liquidator so appointed had capacity to sue. In the view of the court capacity and title were established by the laws of Minnesota. United States Constitution, article 4, &#167; 1. The ruling did not affect the power of Wisconsin to subject the proceeds of the cause of action or any other assets to the claims of local creditors.

So much, again, is settled by unimpeachable authority. <i>Security Trust Co.</i> v. <i>Dodd, Mead &amp; Co., supra</i><i>; </i><i>Disconto Gesellschaft</i> v. <i>Umbreit,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96803\"><a href=\"/opinion/96803/disconto-gesellschaft-v-umbreit/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span>, 579, 580; <i>Cole</i> v. <i>Cunningham,</i> 133 U.S. 107; <i>Oakey</i> v. <i>Bennett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86628\"><a href=\"/opinion/86628/oakey-v-bennett/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 44; <i>Ockerman</i> v. <i>Cross,</i> 54 N.Y. 29; <i>Warner</i> v. <i>Jaffray,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></span>, 255; <i>Barth</i> v. <i>Backus,</i> 140 N.Y. 230; 35 N.E. 425; <i>Ward</i> v. <i>Connecticut Pipe Mfg.

In respect of his subjection to the power of the local law, his position is no better than that of the dissolved corporation to whose title he has succeeded or of its voluntary assignee upon a trust for all the creditors. He must submit, as must they, to the mandate of the sovereignty that has the physical control of what he would reduce to his possession. Cf. <i>Disconto Gesellschaft</i> v. <i>Umbreit, supra</i><i>; </i><i>City Bank Farmers Trust Co.</i> v. <i>Schnader,</i> 293 U.S. 112; <i>Cooper</i> v. <i>Philadelphia Worsted Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.

The diversity of practice was pointed out, with citation of the precedents, when the case was here before, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102256\"><a href=\"/opinion/102256/clark-v-williard/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span>, at p. 122. Some states prefer a rule of equal distribution and compel the local suitor to yield to the statutory successor (<i>Martyne</i> v. <i>American Union Fire Ins. Co.,</i> 216 N.Y. 183; 110 N.E. 502), though at times with precautionary conditions. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*215</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102256\"><a href=\"/opinion/102256/clark-v-williard/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span>, at p. 129; <i>People</i> v. <i>Granite State Provident Association,</i> 161 N.Y. 492; 55 N.E. 1053. Other states give the local creditor a free hand, with the result that he may seize what he can find, though the assets of the debtor are dismembered in the process. <i>Lackmann</i> v. <i>Supreme Council,</i> 142 Cal. 22; 75 Pac. 583; <i>Shloss</i> v. <i>Metropolitan Surety Co.,</i> 149 Ia. 382; 128 N.W. 384; <i>Zacher</i> v. <i>Fidelity Trust Co.,</i> 109 Ky. 441; 59 S.W. 493. Choice is uncontrolled, as between one policy and the other, so far as the Constitution of the Nation has any voice upon the subject. Iowa may say that one who is a liquidator with title, appointed by her statutes, shall be so recognized in Montana with whatever rights and privileges accompany such recognition according to Montana law. For failure to give adherence to that principle we reversed and remanded when the case was last before us. Iowa may not say, however, that a liquidator with title who goes into Montana may set at naught Montana law as to the distribution of Montana assets, and carry over into another state the rule of distribution prescribed by the statutes of the domicile.</p>\n<p><i>Converse</i> v. <i>Hamilton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97605\"><a href=\"/opinion/97605/converse-v-hamilton/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></a></span>, holds nothing to the contrary. A statutory liquidator of a Minnesota corporation brought suit in Wisconsin against defendants there residing to enforce their personal liability as stockholders in accordance with a Minnesota statute. The only question was whether the liquidator so appointed had capacity to sue. In the view of the court, capacity and title were established by the laws of Minnesota. United States Constitution, Article IV, § 1. The ruling did not affect the power of Wisconsin to subject the proceeds of the cause of action or any other assets to the claims of local creditors. Nothing in the case suggests that creditors of the Minnesota corporation were suing in Wisconsin or that there was threat of suit thereafter. The problem now here was left untouched and unconsidered.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*216</span> The petitioner makes a point that the property or part of it subjected to the levy was not of such a nature as to have a situs in Montana or to be amenable to process issuing from her courts. No such point was made in the record of the proceedings in the court below. No such point was made in this court in the petition for certiorari to bring the case here for review. It will not be considered now. <i>Gunning</i> v. <i>Cooley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101537\"><a href=\"/opinion/101537/gunning-v-cooley/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 98; <i>Zellerbach Paper Co.</i> v. <i>Helvering,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102323\"><a href=\"/opinion/102323/zellerbach-paper-co-v-helvering/\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span>, 182; <i>Helvering</i> v. <i>Taylor,</i> 293 U.S. 507.</p>\n<p>The decree should be affirmed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>", "id": 102383, "judges": "Cardozo", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/102383/", "sha1": "bb21700978b66901dbbaff4355a15c1783b5fa66", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:52:31"}
