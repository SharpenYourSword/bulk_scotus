In so deciding, the District Court sustained the first of the above-mentioned contentions of respondent, and also the second contention with respect to the denial of the equal protection of the laws, following its decision to the same effect in Standard Oil Company v. Fox, 6 F. Supp. 494. That decision was reversed by this Court. Fox v. Standard Oil Company, 294 U. S. 87, 55 S. Ct. 333, 79 L. Ed. 780, decided January 14, 1935.
