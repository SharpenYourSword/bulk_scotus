Int.Rev.Acts, page 708. The statutory provisions involved are those of the 1934 Act relating to capital gains or losses, particularly 'losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets' considered in the Hammel case which are made applicable to petitioner, a corporation, by &#167; 23(f), (j), 26 U.S.C.A.

We granted certiorari, 310 U.S. 622, 60 S.Ct. 1097, 84 L.Ed. 1395, so that the case might be considered with the conflicting decision of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in the Hammel case, Com'r of Internal Revenue v.
