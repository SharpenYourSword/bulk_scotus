Appellant contends that this statute as applied violates an exemption from taxation granted by &#167; 13 of an Ohio statute of February 17, 1809 (7 Ohio Laws, p. 188), which allegedly became a part of her contract through execution of the lease, and impairs the obligation of her contract contrary to Article I, &#167; 10 of the Constitution.
