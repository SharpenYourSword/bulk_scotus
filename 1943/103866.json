On the same day that court sent to the Superior Court from which the appeal was taken a rescript which contained the following order: 'Ordered, that the clerk of said court . . . make the following entry under said case in the docket of said court: viz., Final Decree to be modified by the insertion of a clause to the effect that the bill is dismissed on the ground that the questions raised have become moot; decree as so modified is affirmed with costs.'
