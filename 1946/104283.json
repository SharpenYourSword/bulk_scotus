Early in January, 1943, they sold these receipts at a price above that fixed by the Administrator for bulk whiskey, Maximum Price Regulation 193, 7 Fed.Reg. 6006 (August 4, 1942), on the assumption that the receipts constituted 'securities' expressly exempt from the pricing provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of the sale of these certificates the Administrator, under &#167; 205(e) of the Emergency Price Control Act, 56 Stat. 23, 34, 50 U.S.C.App. &#167; 925(e), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, &#167; 925(e), brought a suit for treble damages against the petitioner to recover approximately $6,800,000. That suit is still pending. In May, 1945, petitioners, invoking the authority of &#167; 203(a), 56 Stat. 23, 31, 58 Stat. 632, 638, 50 U.S.C.App. &#167; 923(a), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, &#167; 923(a), sought to have the regulation on which the enforcement proceedings against them were based declared invalid or inapplicable by a protest filed with the Administrator. He dismissed it on the authority of Thomas Paper Stock Co. v. Bowles, Em.App., 148 F.2d 831, the ruling of which we have reversed in Utah Junk Co. v. Porter, 328 U.S. 39, 66 S.Ct. 889. Petitioners then went to the Emergency Court, which dismissed the complaint without opinion, and we granted certiorari. 326 U.S. 710, 66 S.Ct. 139. Prior to the petition for certiorari, petitioners obtained leave of the trial court in the treble damage action to file a complaint with the Emergency Court under &#167; 204(e) of the Act, 58 Stat. 632, 639, 50 U.S.C.App. &#167; 924(e), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, &#167; 924(e), and on January 10, 1946, that court sustained the validity of the regulation.

United States, 319 U.S. 41, 42, 63 S.Ct. 910, 911, 87 L.Ed. 1199. The decision of this case may affect the rights of the litigants. The Emergency Court sustained the challenged regulation. It refused to pass on the applicability of the regulation to the petitioners. It left that question to the District Court before which the treble damage suit is pending.

Bowles, Em.App., 152 F.2d 764; Collins v. Bowles, supra. And in the event that the Emergency Court had found the regulation inapplicable and such decision had been made before a judgment was rendered in the District Court, its ruling would be binding upon the District Court. Under &#167; 204(e)(2) (ii), consideration of a protest under &#167; 203(a) is not a ground for staying the proceedings in the District Court, since the protest proceeding did not precede the suit in the District Court; and under the same provisions of the Act determination of the protest proceeding under &#167; 203(a) can have no retroactive effect once the District Court has entered its judgment.
