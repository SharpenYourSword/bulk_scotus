On that date he was enrolled as a lieutenant commander within one of the six classifications which constituted the temporary members of the Coast Guard Reserve.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> His enrollment was under authority of the Coast Guard Auxiliary and Reserve Act which provided for the enrolling of 'persons (including Government employees without pay other than the compensation of their civilian positions).' 55 Stat. 12, as amended, 56 Stat. 1021, 14 U.S.C. &#167; 307, 14 U.S.C.A. &#167; 307 note.

He received the same pay after enrollment that he had received as a civil service employee. He received overtime pay as a civil service employee, deductions were made from his pay for civil service retirement, and he was subject to civil service regulations as to annual and sick leave. If he had been injured or killed, he would have received benefits as a civil employee of the United States. He was still subject to the Selective Training and Service Act, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, &#167; 301 et seq. In the case of sickness or disease contracted while on active duty, taxpayer was entitled to the same hospital and medical care as members of the regular Coast Guard, but dental care was not included. While on active duty he was required to wear the uniform of and he received the courtesies due his rank.

He had also the status of a civil service employee, carefully so limited and with all the privileges incident to such status. He was given just enough military status to enable him effectively to carry out his duties.

We agree that he had a military status for some purposes. But the question for tax purposes is whether he received his pay in that status. To come within &#167; 22(b)(13(A), he must have received his compensation 'for active service as a commissoned officer.' We understand this to mean that if taxpayer received his pay as a commissioned officer, he would be entitled to the exclusion.

The Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries referred to the amendment by which the parenthetical phrase was added to the statute as being 'advisable to clarify this authority (enrollment of temporary members without the pay of their military rank) and resolve any doubt of its applicability to Government employees by specifically providing for temporary membership in the Coast Guard Reserve of Government employees without military pay but with continuance in their civilian positions and the receipt of the compensation thereof.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the date of the enactment of the enrollment statute there seems to have been no deviation from the view that the taxpayer was to be paid as a civil service employee and not as a commissioned officer.

His pay was at the civil service scale for his grade, with overtime pay and appropriate deductions for civil service retirement. His continuing civilian status is underlined by his receipt of a civil service promotion, from which his military promotion resulted.

I would be unable, in view of the rule that tax exemptions are strictly construed, to say that the compensation of a man who did not receive a commissioned officer's pay but served `without pay other than the compensation of [his] civilian positions' was `received. . . for active service as a commissioned officer.' \" 84 U.

The Committee added that the amendment \"would obviate any possible impairment of the right of such employees to continue to receive the compensation of their civilian positions for the entire period of their performance of active Coast Guard duty as such temporary members. There will be little, if any, change in the nature of their duties after enrollment.\"</p>\n<p>[5]  Office Memorandum No. 13-43 issued by the Commandant of the Coast Guard on July 24, 1943, states:\n</p>\n<p>\"6. The attention of heads of offices and chiefs of divisions is invited to the fact that one of the principal reasons for the induction of civil service employees into the military establishment as temporary members of the Reserve was to obtain a homogeneous organization on a military basis and to eliminate differences in procedure and practices applicable to military personnel and civil service personnel engaged on exactly the same duty . . . .\"</p>\n\n</div>", "id": 104724, "judges": "Minton", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/104724/", "sha1": "214cf6848dc591c78871dd1987943b9c44bd5299", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": "1949-006", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T09:55:09"}
