In view of these orders the Attorney General promptly moved to substitute the United States as party plaintiff in the present proceedings. Although the district judge granted the motion, he dismissed the complaints in 1950 on the ground that there had been an improper substitution because the suits could not be maintained in the name of the United States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The Court of Appeals affirmed. 183 F.2d 453. It held that the President in his Executive Orders did not intend to authorize conduct of &#167; 205(e) actions in the name of the United States. A belief that the President had no power to do so led the court to this conclusion. To resolve the conflict between the decision and those from other circuits,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> we granted certiorari. 340 U.S. 895, 71 S.Ct. 237.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that it was error to construe the Executive Orders as not allowing maintenance of these suits in the name of the United States. It is true that Order No. 9841 which transferred various OPA functions to the Secretary of Commerce empowered the Secretary to 'institute, maintain, or defend in his own name civil proceedings in any court * * *, relating to the matters transferred to him, including any such proceedings pending on the effective date of the transfer * * *.' (Emphasis added.)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> But this provision demonstrates no purpose to vest exclusive power in the Secretary to maintain all &#167; 205(e) enforcement actions.

Such a conclusion, however, is certainly not compelled by the section which provides merely for the bringing of actions by 'the Administrator * * * on behalf of the United States * * *.' There can be no question but that the President as a step in the winding-up process had power to transfer any or all of the price administration functions to the Attorney General. Fleming v.

Accordingly, Executive Order 9842 could lawfully delegate the control and direction of the present actions to that official. Moreover, nothing in &#167; 205(e) prevents the Attorney General, who is customarily charged with representing the Government's interests in court, from following his normal procedure of maintaining enforcement suits in the name of the United States itself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> No unfairness to the defendants will result.

Such a conclusion, however, is certainly not compelled by the section which provides <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> merely for the bringing of actions by \"the Administrator. . . on behalf of the United States . . . .\" There can be no question but that the President as a step in the winding-up process had power to transfer any or all of the price administration functions to the Attorney General. <i>Fleming</i> v. <i>Mohawk Co.,</i> 331 U. S. 111, 113-119. Accordingly, Executive Order 9842 could lawfully delegate the control and direction of the present actions to that official. Moreover, nothing in § 205 (e) prevents the Attorney General, who is customarily charged with representing the Government's interests in court, from following his normal procedure of maintaining enforcement suits in the name of the United States itself.<sup>[10]</sup> No unfairness to the defendants will result. Regardless of captions, the issues in these cases could not change and the real party-in-interest plaintiff has always been the same. Cf. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Remund,</i> 330 U. S. 539, 542-543. The handling of this litigation in the name of the United States is a fair and orderly method for carrying out the congressional mandate to wind up the OPA affairs. These cases should not have been dismissed.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR.

Fleming, Administrator of the Office of Temporary Controls after he had become the successor to the Price Administrator. On April 23, 1947, all six suits were properly pending in Fleming's name. See <i>Fleming</i> v. <i>Mohawk Co.,</i> 331 U. S. 111, 113-119. The manner in which he became the successor of the Price Administrator is detailed by the Court of Appeals in its opinion below. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Allied Oil Corp.,</i> 183 F. 2d 453.</p>\n<p>[3]  12 Fed.
