Respondent-union and petitioner-employer entered into a collective bargaining agreement governing the hours of work, rates of pay, and working conditions in a Massachusetts plant owned by petitioner.

The District Court dismissed the bill, being of the view that the relief sought was barred by the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C.A. &#167; 101 et seq. 129 F.Supp. 665. The Court of Appeals reversed, 233 F.2d 85. It first held that the Norris-LaGuardia Act did not bar enforcement of the arbitration agreement. It then held that while &#167; 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C.A. &#167; 185(a) gave the District Court jurisdiction of the cause, it supplied no body of substantive law to enforce an arbitration agreement governing grievances.
