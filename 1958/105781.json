Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe R.

On remand, that court held that the question of negligence was foreclosed by this Court's decision and affirmed a judgment in favor of the petitioner on condition that petitioner accept a remittitur. Tex.Civ.App., 306 S.W.2d 171. On review, the Texas Supreme Court, 312 S.W.2d 933, 942, remanded the case to the Court of Civil Appeals 'with directions * * * to adjudicate, upon its own independent evaluation of the evidence and wholly apart from the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States, whether or not the jury finding of negligence of the defendant * * * is so against the weight and preponderance of the evidence as to require a new trial in the interest of justice and, upon the basis of its said adjudication, to either affirm the judgment of the trial court or grant a new trial.'
