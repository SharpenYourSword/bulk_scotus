They were indicted with others for restraining trade, conspiring to monopolize and attempting to monopolize commerce in violation of &#167;&#167; 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1, 2, 15 U.S.C.A. &#167;&#167; 1, 2. Shortly after the indictment was returned, petitioners were dissolved under their respective state statutes and became separate divisions of a new corporation under the same ultimate ownership. They then moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that their dissolution abated the proceeding. The District Court denied the motions, holding that under the applicable Maryland and Delaware statutes the existence of the dissolved corporations continued so far as prosecution of this criminal proceeding was concerned. United States v. Maryland Shate Licensed Beverage Ass'n, D.C., 138 F.Supp. 685. Petitioners then pleaded nolo contendere and the District Court levied fines against them. The Court of Appeals affirmed, 258 F.2d 726. The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted because of a conflict among the Circuits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> 358 U.S. 878, 79 S.Ct. 125, 3 L.Ed.2d 109.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start from the premise that in the federal domain prosecutions abate both on the death of an individual defendant (List v. State of Pennsylvania, 131 U.S. 396, 9 S.Ct. 794, 33 L.Ed. 222; Schreiber v. Sharpless, 110 U.S. 76, 3 S.Ct. 423, 28 L.Ed. 65) and on the dissolution of a corporate defendant (Defense Supplies Corp. v. Lawrence Warehouse Co., 336 U.S. 631, 634, 69 S.Ct. 762, 763, 93 L.Ed. 931), unless the action is saved by statute. We need not decide whether federal law alone would be sufficient to save a federal cause of action against a corporation dissolved under state law. We have here a situation where the interplay of federal and state law makes it clear that petitioners did not escape criminal responsibility under the Sherman Act by the kind of dissolution decreed under Maryland and Delaware law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sherman Law in &#167; 8 defines 'person' to include corporations 'existing' under the laws of any State. The question whether a corporation 'exists' for any purpose is thus determined by reference to state law. We conclude that under both Maryland and Delaware law the lives of these corporations were not cut short, as is sometimes done on dissolution, cf. Chicago Title &amp; Trust Co. v. Forty-One Thirty-Six Wilcox Bldg.Corp., 302 U.S. 120, 58 S.Ct. 125, 82 L.Ed. 147, but were sufficiently continued so that this proceeding did not abate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Maryland, during the period relevant here, though the dissolution of the corporation was effective when the articles of dissolution had been accepted, the corporation continued 'in existence for the purpose of paying, satisfying ad d ischarging any existing debts and obligations * * *.' (Flack's Md.Ann.Code 1951, Art. 23, &#167; 72(b). It was also provided in &#167; 78(a) that 'such dissolution' shall not 'abate any pending suit or proceeding by or against the corporation * * *.' We have found no Maryland decisions interpreting these sections; but we are satisfied that the term 'proceeding,' no matter how the state court may construe it,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> implies enough vitality to make the corporation an 'existing' enterprise for the purposes of &#167; 8 of the Sherman Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Delaware statute seems equally clear, though again there is no authoritative interpretation of it.
