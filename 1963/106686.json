The principal issue was whether, in view of the nature of the work performed at the time of injury, the petitioner was a seaman, hence within the coverage of the Jones Act, or an offshore drilling employee. At the trial before a jury, the District Court admitted evidence, over the objection of petitioner's counsel, that petitioner had accepted compensation benefits under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 901 et seq., as applied through the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. &#167; 1331 et seq. The latter Act, although extending longshoremen's compensation to a new group, is explicitly inapplicable to a 'member of a crew of any vessel.' 43 U.S.C. &#167; 1333(c)(1). In response to a special interrogatory the jury found that the petitioner was not a seaman or member of a crew of a vessel within the meaning of the Jones Act. Judgment was then entered upon the verdict for the respondent. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit unanimously held it error to have admitted the evidence of other compensation benefits but, with one judge dissenting, found the error harmless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> We grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and vacate the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not agree that on the record in this case the error may be regarded as harmless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> There can be no doubt that the evidence of other benefits was pressed upon the jury. Throughout the trial respondent's counsel emphasized that the petitioner 'has a remedy under a federal compensation act, and in fact received benefits in the form of weekly payments under that act * * *.' The only argued relevance of this evidence was that it indicated what the petitioner had thought to be his legal status. The judge did not, however, frame a cautionary instruction or otherwise charge the jury that the evidence of other compensation might be considered only insofar as it revealed what the petitioner and others thought his status to be&#8212;whether seaman or drilling employee&#8212;and was not dispositive of the ultimate fact of whether he was a seaman. To the contrary, the judge's charge, containing an elaborate discussion of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act and a restatement of the disputed evidence, only heightened the likelihood of prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A subsequent exchange between judge and jury did not, in our opinion, negate the cumulative impact of the evidence and the instructions.

Indeed, the jury's inquiry to the judge seems to indicate that, under the case as submitted, the jury was led to place undue emphasis on the availability of compensation benefits in determining the ultimate question of whether the petitioner was a seaman within the Jones Act.
