Petitioners were convicted by a jury in the Eastern District of Missouri on both counts of a two-count indictment. The first count charged them with failure to 'produce' or to 'preserve' certain purchase records, in violation of 72 Stat. 1400, 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5603(b)(5). The second count charged them with failure 'to keep' certain purchase records or 'make required entries therein' in violation of 72 Stat. 1400, 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5603(b)(1). Petitioner James A.
