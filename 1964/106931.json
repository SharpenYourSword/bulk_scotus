The District Court held invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Pennsylvania Representative Apportionment Act of January 9, 1964, P.L. 1419, 25 Purdon's Pa.Stat.Ann. &#167;&#167; 2221-2222 (1963 Supp., including Acts of the 1963 Extra Session), the Pennsylvania Senatorial Apportionment Act of January 9, 1964, P.L. 1432, 25 Purdon's Pa.Stat.Ann. &#167;&#167; 2217-2220 (1963 Supp., including Acts of the 1963 Extra Session), and the Pennsylvania Constitution's legislative apportionment provisions Art. II, &#167;&#167; 16, 17 (P.S.). The court restrained appellants from conducting any future elections under the apportionment acts, but stayed its order pending the disposition of an appeal to this Court. Thereafter on June 15, 1964, this Court decided Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506, and companion cases: WMCA, Inc. v. Lomenzo, 377 U.S. 633, 84 S.Ct. 1418, 12 L.Ed.2d 568; Maryland Comm. for Fair Representation v. Tawes, 377 U.S. 656, 84 S.Ct. 1429, 12 L.Ed.2d 595; Davis v.

Forty-Fourth General Assembly of Colorado, 377 U.S. 713, 84 S.Ct. 1459, 12 L.Ed.2d 632. On September 29, 1964, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania handed down a decision construing the legislative apportionment provisions of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and holding these provisions constitutional as construed. The court, however, declared invalid, under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Pennsylvania legislative apportionment laws at issue in this appeal. Butcher v.
