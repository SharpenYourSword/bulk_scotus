Id., at 413, 331 F.2d, at 73. The history of the formation of the Brigade, its relationship with the Communist Party and with Communists, the manner in which international brigades of this kind were employed by Communists, the role of Communists in forming this Brigade, the affiliations of officers of the Brigade, the ideas and program promoted by the Brigade's official organ, Volunteer for Liberty, the efforts of the Brigade to get its members employed in unions, offices, or factories where a Communist unit or functionary was located, the extent to which the Brigade responded to Party discipline, and the extent to which the Brigade aided and supported the Party&#8212;all were fully explored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since 1950 the Brigade's affairs have been run almost entirely by an Executive Secretary and a National Commander.

Hearings before the Board commenced May 3, 1954, and ended November 16, 1954. Over a year later the Board issued a registration order against the Brigade, and its report in the case.
