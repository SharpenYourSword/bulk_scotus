Insofar as the judgment decides other questions, it is vacated and the cause is remanded for further consideration in light of the supervening decision of the Colorado Supreme Court in <i>White</i> v. <i>Anderson,</i> ___ Colo. ___, 394 P. 2d 333 (1964).</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE CLARK, MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR.

We deem it appropriate explicitly to state our view that this is the course which the District Court should follow. On this basis, we join the Court's opinion.</p>\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "", "id": 1087711, "judges": "Per Curiam", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/1087711/", "sha1": "aa8dd9b24b88edde71b17aad3f1486aabaed79d7", "source": "L", "time_retrieved": "2013-10-29T19:17:13.773464"}
