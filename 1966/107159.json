Chandler here asks for a stay of an \"Order\" of the Judicial Council of the Tenth Circuit directing that until further order of the Council, Judge Chandler \"take no action whatsoever in any case or proceeding now or hereafter pending\" in his court, that cases now assigned to him be assigned to other judges, and that no new actions filed be assigned to him.  If this order is not stayed and if the Judicial Council has some way to enforce it, the order means that Judge Chandler is completely barred from performing any of his official duties and in effect is removed or ousted from office pending further orders of the Council.  The reason given by the Council for this drastic action is that it \"finds that Judge Chandler is presently unable, or unwilling to discharge efficiently the duties of his office.  * * * \"  By refusing to stay the Council's order, the Court necessarily acts on the premise that the Council has a legal right to remove Judge Chandler from office at least temporarily.  Though the Court tries to soft-pedal its refusal to stay the order by referring to it as \"interlocutory in character,\" the stark fact which cannot be disguised is that a United States District Judge, duly appointed by the President and approved by the Senate, is with this Court's imprimatur locked out of his office pending \"further proceedings\" by the Judicial Council.  I think the Council is completely without legal authority to issue any such order, either temporary or permanent, with or without a hearing, that no statute purports to authorize it, and that the Constitution forbids it.  Nor can the effect of the order be softened by asserting that Judge Chandler will be permitted to have a lawyer represent him before his fellow judges.  Assuming that we have jurisdiction to stay an order from a governmental agency that has no power at all to do what this Council has done, I would stay this \"Order\" <i>instanter.</i></p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Council states that its order was made \"pursuant to the power and authority vested in the Judicial Council by the Act of June 25, 1948, [c.] p. 646, &#167; 332, 62 Stat. 902, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 332.\" That section so far as relevant reads:</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Each judicial council shall make all necessary orders for      the effective and expeditious administration of the business      of the courts within its circuit.

We should stop in its infancy, before it has any growth at all, this idea that the United States district judges can be made accountable for their efficiency or lack of it to the judges just over them in the federal judicial system.
