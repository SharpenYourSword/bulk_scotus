The Trial Judge submitted this question to the jury in the form of a special interrogatory which asked that the jury, if it found negligent design, 'please indicate' which of five specified design aspects of the hoist had been found unsafe. The jury was to answer 'Yes' or 'No' with respect to each of the five enumerated factors. The jury returned a special verdict for petitioner, answering one of the five subsections of the interrogatory in petti oner's favor and leaving the other four unanswered.

The court then held that the evidence did not support the jury's finding of negligence as to the fifth aspect of design and reversed the trial court's judgment with instructions to enter judgment for respondent. Petitioner sought rehearing in the Court of Appeals, noting her timely objection to the trial court's use of the special interrogatory and arguing that the Court of Appeals had improperly restricted its review of the evidence to the one aspect of design.
