The State was given until October 1, 1969, to enact statutes redistricting the State so as to correct the constitutional infirmity. Upon the State's failure to enact such statutes, the District Court, on December 15, 1969, entered an order establishing legislative districts in the State.

The date for the commencement of filing for the November 1970 election to the General Assembly is February 24, 1970.
