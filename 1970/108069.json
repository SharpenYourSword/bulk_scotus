State University in the summer of 1967. His indefinite suspension was confirmed after a hearing in September of that year, in which charges against him were specified, evidence taken, and findings made. He, along with two other suspended students, brought suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, seeking to set aside the suspension on First Amendment and due process grounds. After a hearing, the District Court granted judgment on the merits to defendants with an opinion. 279 F.Supp. 190 (1968). On appeal the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. 407 F.2d 834 (1969). We granted certiorari, 396 U.S. 817, 90 S.Ct. 145, 24 L.Ed.2d 69 (1969), primarily to consider the issues raised by Jones' claim that he had been separated from the university solely because of his distribution of leaflets urging a boycott of fall registration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After oral argument, and on closer review of the record, it emerges&#8212;as it did not from the certiorari papers or the opinions of the District Court and the Court of Appeals&#8212;that Jones' indefinite suspension was based in part on a finding that he lied at the hearing on the charges against him. This fact sufficiently clouds the record to render the case an inappropriate vehicle for this Court's first decision on the extent of First Amendment restrictions upon the power of state universities to expel or indefinitely suspend students for the expression of views alleged to be disruptive of the good order of the campus.

But we recognized in Terminiello v. City of Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 69 S.Ct. 894, 93 L.Ed. 1131, that even strongly abusive utterances or publications, not merely polished and urbane pronouncements of dignified people, enjoy First Amendment protection. We said in Terminiello:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'(A) function of free speech under our system of government      is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high      purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates      dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs      people to anger. Speech is often provocative and challenging.      It may strike at prejudices and preconceptions and have      profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of      an idea.' Id., at 4, 69 S.Ct., at 896.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Students are certainly entitled to enjoy First Amendment rights. West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 637, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 1185, 87 L.Ed. 1628; Sweezy v. New Hampshire, by Wyman, 354 U.S. 234, 250, 77 S.Ct. 1203, 1211, 1 L.Ed.2d 1311. This does not mean that free speech can be used with impunity as an excuse to break up classrooms, to destroy the quiet and decorum of convocations, or to bar the constitutional privileges of others to meet together in matters of common concern. But the campus, where this leaflet was distributed, is a fitting place for the dissemination of a wide spectrum of ideas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, it is far too late to suggest that since attendance at a state university is a 'privilege,' not a 'right,' there are no constitutional barriers to summary withdrawal of the 'privilege.' Such labeling does not resolve constitutional questions, as we recently noted in Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 627 n. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 1327, 22 L.Ed.2d 600. The doctrine that a government, state or federal, may not grant a benefit or privilege on conditions requiring the recipient to relinquish his constitutional rights is now well established. E.g., Cafeteria and Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 894, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 1748, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230; Sherbert v.

Railroad Comm., 271 U.S. 583, 593&#8212;594, 46 S.Ct. 605, 607, 70 L.Ed. 1101; see Van Alstyne, The Demise of the Right-Privilege Distinction in Constitutional Law, 81 Harv.L.Rev. 1439, 1445&#8212;1454 (1968); Comment, Another Look at Unconstitutional Conditions, 117 U.Pa.L.Rev. 144 (1968). As stated in Homer v. Richmond, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 226, 292 F.2d 719, 722:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'One may not have a constitutional right to go to Baghdad,      but the Government may not prohibit one from going there      unless by means consonant with due process of law.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not mean that the whole panoply of the Bill of Rights is applicable to student dismissal proceedings. It does mean, however, that where there are 'constitutional restraints upon state and federal governments' in dealing with the persons subject to their supervision, the persons in question have 'a constitutional right to notice and a hearing before they can be removed.' Cafeteria and Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473 v. McElroy, supra, 367 U.S. at 898, 81 S.Ct. at 1750.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Rives, speaking for the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, stated in Dixon v. Alabama State Board of Education, 294 F.2d 150, 157: '(No) one can question that the right to remain at the college in which the plaintiffs were students in good standing is an interest of extremely great value.' Judge Rives went on to hold that such 'privilege' or 'right' could not be taken away without notice and hearing. Id., at 158. Thus the dissent of Judge Clark in Steier v. New York State Education Comm'r, 2 Cir., 271 F.2d 13, 22&#8212;23, became the law. See Wright, The Constitution on the Campus, 22 Vand.L.Rev. 1027, 1028&#8212;1034 (1969).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we look at the present proceeding we learn that there was notice and that there were hearings. The charge was circulating the leaflet, which clearly was a First Amendment right. As we said in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 506, 89 S.Ct. 733, 736, 21 L.Ed.2d 731:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'First Amendment rights, applied in light of the special      characteristics of the school environment, are available to      teachers and students. It can hardly be argued that either      students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to      freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate. This      has been the unmistakable holding of this Court for almost 50      years.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the very least the suspension raises a serious constitutional question in the absence of provision for a timely judicial determination of the First Amendment claims. Cf. Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51, 85 S.Ct. 734, 13 L.Ed.2d 649.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circulation did not disrupt a classroom or any other university function.

If he is to be expelled for lying, he is entitled to notice and opportunity to be heard on that charge. We said in a case involving the disbarment of a lawyer, 'The charge must be known before the proceedings commence.' In re Ruffalo, 390 U.S. 544, 551, 88 S.Ct. 1222, 1226, 20 L.Ed.2d 117. In that case one of the grounds of disbarment was petitioner's employment of one Orlando as an investigator. That was not included in any charge made prior to the disbarment hearing. Petitioner was not aware that it would be considered as a disbarment offense until after both he and Orlando testified on all aspects of that phase of the case. We said that disbarment proceedings</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'become a trap when, after they are underway, the charges are      amended on the basis of testimony of the accused.

Thus the dissent of Judge Clark in <i>Steier</i> v. <i>New York State Education Comm'r,</i> 271 F. 2d 13, 22-23, became the law. See Wright, The Constitution on the Campus, 22 Vand. L.

Roberts,</i> Assistant Attorney General of Tennessee, argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were <i>David M. Pack,</i> Attorney General, and <i>Thomas E. Fox,</i> Deputy Attorney General.</p>\n<p>PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Jones was suspended indefinitely as a student at Tennessee A. &amp; I. State University in the summer of 1967. His indefinite suspension was confirmed after a hearing in September of that year, in which charges against him were specified, evidence taken, and findings made. He, along with two other suspended students, brought suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, seeking to set aside the suspension on First Amendment and due process grounds. After a hearing the District Court granted judgment on the merits to defendants with an opinion. 279 F. Supp. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> 190 (1968). On appeal the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. 407 F. 2d 834 (1969). We granted certiorari, 396 U. S. 817 (1969), primarily to consider the issues raised by Jones' claim that he had been separated from the university solely because of his distribution of leaflets urging a boycott of fall registration.</p>\n<p>After oral argument, and on closer review of the record, it emergesas it did not from the certiorari papers or the opinions of the District Court and the Court of Appealsthat Jones' indefinite suspension was based in part on a finding that he lied at the hearing on the charges against him. This fact sufficiently clouds the record to render the case an inappropriate vehicle for this Court's first decision on the extent of First Amendment restrictions upon the power of state universities to expel or indefinitely suspend students for the expression of views alleged to be disruptive of the good order of the campus. Accordingly the writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvidently granted.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK, for reasons set out in the above opinion and others stated in his dissent in <i>Tinker</i> v. <i>Des Moines School Dist.,</i> 393 U. S. 503, 515-526, would affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN concurs, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Petitioner, a student at Tennessee A. &amp; I. State University, was dismissed from the school on charges preferred by a Faculty Advisory Committee and heard by it. One of the charges read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"You are charged with distributing literature and soliciting students, all of which was designed to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> boycott the registration at the University for the Fall Quarter 1967. This occurred during the Summer of 1967.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The literature urging a boycott of registration was a pamphlet which is printed in the Appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p>Petitioner, being suspended indefinitely, brought this suit in the District Court for an injunction and other relief. That court denied relief, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2346463\"><a href=\"/opinion/2346463/jones-v-state-board-of-education-of-and-for-state-/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span>, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 407 F. 2d 834. Our failure to reverse is a serious setback for First Amendment rights in a troubled field.</p>\n<p>The leaflet now censored may be ill-tempered and in bad taste. But we recognized in <i>Terminiello</i> v. <i>Chicago,</i> 337 U. S. 1, that even strongly abusive utterances or publications, not merely polished and urbane pronouncements of dignified people, enjoy First Amendment protection. We said in <i>Terminiello:</i></p>\n<blockquote>\"[A] function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger.
