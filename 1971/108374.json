During 1967 petitioner was tried and convicted in the state courts, after a jury trial, of the armed robbery of the manager, but the conviction was reversed on appeal because the trial judge neglected to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of larceny. Griffin v. State, 202 So.2d 602 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1967). In 1968 petitioner was retried on the same charge and acquitted. Subsequently, he was charged with robbing the customer. His motion to quash the information on double jeopardy grounds was overruled and a jury found petitioner guilty of armed robbery. Each of the three jury verdicts here involved was a general one. The trial court imposed a 30-year sentence and petitioner appealed to the District Court of Appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the adjudication of petitioner's apppeal, this Court rendered its decision in Ashe v.

We there held that the principle of collateral estoppel, which 'bars relitigation between the same parties of issues actually determined at a previous trial,' id., at 442, 90 S.Ct. 1193, is 'embodied in the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy,' id., at 445, 90 S.Ct., at 1195, and is fully applicable to the States, by force of the Fourteenth Amendment, in light of Benton v.

He contended that the prohibition against double jeopardy operated as a bar to the second prosecution because the only issue in each trial was the identity of the robbers.
