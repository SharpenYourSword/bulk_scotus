In particular, petitioner alleges that he did not accept the court's offer to appoint new counsel from fear of angering the court, and because he did not think a new attorney, unfamiliar with the case, could help him. The District Court in an unreported order denied relief without a hearing, on the ground that the records of the case 'conclusively' demonstrated a valid waiver.

Rhay, 389 U.S. 128, 88 S.Ct. 254, 19 L.Ed.2d 336 (1967). Although the Constitution 'does not require that under all circumstances counsel be forced upon a defendant,' Carter v. Illinois, 329 U.S. 173, 174-175, 67 S.Ct. 216, 218, 91 L.Ed. 172 (1946), a waiver of the right to counsel is valid only if it is voluntarily and understandingly made. Johnson v.

Von Moltke v. Gillies, <i>supra</i>, 332 U.S., at 724, 68 S.Ct. at 323. Nothing reveals an awareness on his part that the offer of new counsel was more than 'a mere procedural formality,' <i>id.</i>, at 722, 68 S.Ct., at 322&#8212;that counsel would have been appointed not merely to stand by his side while the court pronounced sentence. Nothing indicates an appreciation that a continuance might have been granted to permit new counsel to familiarize himself with the case and render the services that this Court has said are integral to \"the very integrity of the fact-finding process.\" McConnell v.

In Vellucci v. United States, 430 F.2d 188 (1970), the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held it to be plain error for a trial judge to excuse the defendant's attorney before sentencing. The Court of Appeals below distinguished <i>Vellucci</i> on the ground that the defendant there, unlike petitioner here, was not offered new counsel.
