During the course of this litigation, the District Court has emphasized that \"the exercise of this unavoidable judicial duty [drafting an apportionment plan] cannot, <i>does not, and will not in any way tie the hands of the Legislature at any time</i> to adopt and enact any plan of its own for the reapportionment of its membership so long as it complies with Constitutional requirements.\" <i>Connor</i> v. <i>Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1457056\"><a href=\"/opinion/1457056/connor-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 494 (SD Miss. 1967) (emphasis in original). This Court has frequently emphasized that \"legislative reapportionment is primarily a matter for legislative consideration and determination, and . . . judicial relief becomes appropriate only when a legislature fails to reapportion according to federal constitutional requisites in a timely fashion after having had an adequate opportunity to do so.\" <i>Reynolds</i> v. <i>Sims,</i> 377 U. S. 533, 586 (1964). See also <i>Burns</i> v. <i>Richardson,</i> 384 U. S. 73, 85 (1966); <i>Ely</i> v. <i>Klahr,</i> 403 U.
