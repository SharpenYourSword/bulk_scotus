According to Arizona law, 'Any number of persons may associate themselves together and become incorporated for the transaction of any <i>lawful</i> business.' Ariz.Rev.Stat. &#167; 10-121 (emphasis supplied). The Commission refused to issue the certificate for the reason that it believed appellant's proposed Articles of Incorporation revealed that the organization had an <i>unlawful</i> purpose for incorporating, that being 'to work for unity in the use of Peyote as a Sacrament and as a means of Divine healing through its Divine power.' It appears to be conceded that the Commission's decision was prompted by the fact that the use, possession, and sale of Peyote is made a misdemeanor by Ariz.Rev.Stat. &#167; 36-1061, and because Peyote is subject to regulation as a 'dangerous drug' under Ariz.Rev.Stat. &#167;&#167; 32-1964, subsec.

Insofar as this prayer asked to enjoin Commission action taken under color of Ariz.Rev.Stat. &#167; 10-121, however, it was insufficient to require a three-judge court. Nowhere in their complaint did appellants attack the constitutionality of &#167; 10-121, either on its face or as applied. Indeed, they concede its constitutionality before this Court, stating explicitly that it is 'neutral in scope and application.' (Appellants' Reply Brief, p. 4.) But, as has been long held, an action to enjoin the allegedly unconstitutional result reached by the Commission in the exercise of its authority under &#167; 10-121 would not sustain the jurisdiction of a three-judge court.

Its opinion that the use of Peyote in religious Sacraments is an unlawful purpose for incorporation does not reflect an official position on the part of those state officers who are charged with law enforcement that members of the Native American Church can be arrested for observing the tenets of their religion. Section 2281 requires that appellants' action be one to restrain 'the action of any officer of such State in the enforcement or execution of such Statute' and this requirement cannot be circumvented 'by joining, as nominal parties defendant, state officers whose action is not the effective means of the enforcement or execution of the challenged statute,' Wilentz v.

The difficulty is that, taking the complaint 'as we find it,' Moody v.

In United States v. Christian Echoes National Ministry, Inc., 404 U.S. 561, 92 S.Ct. 663, 30 L.Ed.2d 716, the Government attempted to take a direct appeal from the decision of a one-judge district court that the Internal Revenue Service had improperly revoked Christian Echoes' tax-exemption as a religious organization under &#167; 501(c)(3) of the Code (because of alleged political activity). Our jurisdiction over the appeal depended on the constitutionality of &#167; 501(c)(3) 'as applied' having been called into question by the District Judge's opinion. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1252. Despite the fact that the District Judge found the Service's interpretation of &#167; 501(c)(3) violated Christian Echoes' First Amendment rights, we held that his commentary did <i>not</i> constitute a finding that the statute was unconstitutional 'as applied.'</p>\n        <p>'[T]he District Court's commentary on the denial of the appellee's First Amendment rights was directed to the particular interpretation given to &#167; 501(c)(3) by the Internal Revenue Service in this case and to its means of enforcing that interpretation. . . . The court refused to interpret and apply the section to require an analysis of the 'religious' or 'Non-religious' character of every activity by a concededly religious organization, because such an interpretation and application would infringe the right to free exercise</p>\n        <p>of religion. It stated that the Internal Revenue Service had already gone too far in its enforcement of this interpretation. But the statement that the <i>Service</i> violated the appellee's First Amendment rights is not the same as a holding that <i>Congress</i> did so in enacting &#167; 501(c)(3). The court avoided holding that the section itself was unconstitutional 'as applied'&#8212;<i>i. e.</i>, that the section, by its own terms, infringed constitutional freedoms in the circumstances of the particular case. Rather, it held that the Service had misinterpreted &#167; 501(c)(3) and that the section must be narrowly construed. Although the construction was based on a constitutional premise, it did not amount to a holding that an Act of Congress is unconstitutional. . . .' <i>Id.</i>, at 564, 92 S.Ct., at 665.</p>\n        <p>Similarly, the fact that the Arizona Corporation Commission might have infringed appellants' First Amendment rights in its interpretation of the phrase 'lawful business' in Ariz.Rev.Stat. &#167; 10-121 does not mean that appellants' commentary on this action called into question the constitutionality of &#167; 10-121 'as applied.' As in <i>Christian Echoes</i>, 'although the [attack] was based on a constitutional premise, it did not amount to a [claim] that [the statute] is unconstitutional.'

Our jurisdiction over the appeal depended on the constitutionality of &#167; 501(c)(3) 'as applied' having been called into question by the District Judge's opinion. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1252. Despite the fact that the District Judge found the Service's interpretation of &#167; 501(c)(3) violated Christian Echoes' First Amendment rights, we held that his commentary did <i>not</i> constitute a finding that the statute was unconstitutional 'as applied.'</p>\n        <p>'[T]he District Court's commentary on the denial of the appellee's First Amendment rights was directed to the particular interpretation given to &#167; 501(c)(3) by the Internal Revenue Service in this case and to its means of enforcing that interpretation. . . . The court refused to interpret and apply the section to require an analysis of the 'religious' or 'Non-religious' character of every activity by a concededly religious organization, because such an interpretation and application would infringe the right to free exercise</p>\n        <p>of religion. It stated that the Internal Revenue Service had already gone too far in its enforcement of this interpretation. But the statement that the <i>Service</i> violated the appellee's First Amendment rights is not the same as a holding that <i>Congress</i> did so in enacting &#167; 501(c)(3). The court avoided holding that the section itself was unconstitutional 'as applied'&#8212;<i>i. e.</i>, that the section, by its own terms, infringed constitutional freedoms in the circumstances of the particular case. Rather, it held that the Service had misinterpreted &#167; 501(c)(3) and that the section must be narrowly construed. Although the construction was based on a constitutional premise, it did not amount to a holding that an Act of Congress is unconstitutional. . . .' <i>Id.</i>, at 564, 92 S.Ct., at 665.</p>\n        <p>Similarly, the fact that the Arizona Corporation Commission might have infringed appellants' First Amendment rights in its interpretation of the phrase 'lawful business' in Ariz.Rev.Stat. &#167; 10-121 does not mean that appellants' commentary on this action called into question the constitutionality of &#167; 10-121 'as applied.' As in <i>Christian Echoes</i>, 'although the [attack] was based on a constitutional premise, it did not amount to a [claim] that [the statute] is unconstitutional.' Rather, it was merely a challenge to 'allegedly erroneous administrative action,' Ex parte Bransford, <i>supra</i>.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Thus, appellees' motion to dismiss, filed in the court below, contained an affidavit from an official of the Narcotics Enforcement Division of the Arizona Department of Public Safety, wherein he averred that he has been with the Department 'since 1966 and during that time they have never arrested any members of the Native American Church of Navajoland where such members were holding an alleged religious ceremony and where there was present at such ceremony only Indians.'</p>\n        <p>At least one Arizona court, moreover, has explicitly ruled that its narocotics statute could not constitutinally be applied to members of the Native American Church.
