Although it has been conceded that the Act's\r\n requirements were applicable in these proceedings, no further\r\n hearings were held; and no environmental impact statement was\r\n drafted. The Commission approved the project and attempted to\r\n satisfy its procedural duties under &#167; 102 by specifying certain\r\n environmental impact forecasts in its final opinion.\r\n \r\n      The Court of Appeals affirmed over the dissent of Judge Oakes\r\n who thought that the Commission had not discharged its obligations\r\n under NEPA. The majority held that under &#167; 101 the ultimate\r\n balance of energy and environmental values was the responsibility\r\n of the Commission and courts could upset only decisions not\r\n supported by 'substantial evidence.' It also held, with respect to\r\n the procedural requirements of &#167; 102, that the Commission's\r\n hearings, and consultation with other agencies satisfied the\r\n command that a 'systematic, interdisciplinary approach' be\r\n utilized.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> It also found that the Commission's final opinion which\r\n contained its environmental findings would, under the\r\n circumstances, suffice as an environmental impact statement. A\r\n petition for rehearing <i>en banc</i> was denied by an equally divided\r\n court with Judge Timbers dissenting in a short opinion which\r\n expressed doubt as to the validity of the majority's reliance on\r\n the 'substantial evidence' test.\r\n \r\n      I believe the Court of Appeals gave the Act too restrictive a\r\n meaning. As to the Commission's duty to take environmental impacts\r\n into account, Judge Oakes made a strong case for the view that the\r\n Commission (a) misjudged the risk that project construction might\r\n work irreparable injury to one of</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\r\n      <p>Page 931\r\n \r\n three vital water supply systems serving New York City; (b)\r\n underestimated the extent of additional air pollution which would\r\n be generated by nighttime burning of fossil fuels in New York City\r\n in order to generate the power needed to pump the river water to\r\n the reservoir; and (c) generally undervalued environmental\r\n considerations while overvaluing engineering and economic\r\n considerations. Although value judgments are inevitable and even\r\n though the Commission's balancing of environmental costs with\r\n other factors may be entitled to some deference, I share Judge\r\n Timber's doubts that under &#167; 101 the balance struck by an agency\r\n unskilled in environmental matters should be reviewed only through\r\n the lens of the 'substantial evidence' test. Cf. Citizens to\r\n Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 413, 91 S.Ct. 814,\r\n 28 L.Ed.2d 136 ('If the statutes are to have any meaning, the\r\n Secretary cannot approve the destruction of parkland unless he\r\n finds that alternative routes present unique problems.') (But see\r\n <i>Calvert Cliffs'</i>, 449 F.2d, at 1115.).\r\n \r\n      I also am not satisfied that the procedural obligations under\r\n &#167; 102 were honored. First, the Commission did not draft the impact\r\n statement required by &#167; 102(2)(C). Thus when the Commissioners\r\n deliberated the fate of Storm King Mountain, they did not have\r\n before them a coherent study addressed to the environmental\r\n consequences of the project and alternatives to it. Another panel\r\n of the Second Circuit has recently ruled that the impact statement\r\n must be written <i>before</i> action is taken. Greene County Planning\r\n Board v. FPC, 455 F.2d 412 (CA2). Administrators cannot attempt to\r\n comply with the Act by calling their final opinion their impact\r\n statement. True, here the hearings had been completed after the\r\n Act became effective. Yet the Commission could have deferred\r\n decision until its own &#167; 102 statement was prepared.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\r\n      <p>Page 932\r\n \r\n      Second, the Commission's final opinion suggests that its\r\n consideration of environmental issues is required only when\r\n private citizens bring such problems to the agency's attention.\r\n For example, in many passages of its opinion the Commission states\r\n that particular objections to the project had been rejected for\r\n lack of evidence in the administrative record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> This approach\r\n symptomatic of the phenomenon of bureaucratic\r\n 'industry-mindedness'&#8212;wrongly assumed that a presumption of\r\n validity supported the Con Ed proposal and that environmental\r\n groups had a burden of proof to overcome.\r\n \r\n      Similarly, the Commission limited its inquiry primarily to\r\n those program alternatives which had been submitted by the\r\n conservationists opposing the Con Ed project. The agency did not\r\n generate its own alternatives, although Congress charged each\r\n federal agency to represent not only the public interest in\r\n general but also under NEPA to pay particular attention to the\r\n environmental ramifications of its actions. Whether or not\r\n conservationists appear to register dissent, the Commission is\r\n told in &#167; 102(2)(D) to 'study, develop and</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\r\n      <p>Page 933\r\n \r\n describe appropriate alternatives to recommend courses of action.\r\n . . .' The agency is directed to apply its own expertise and\r\n imagination in exploring less drastic alternatives. And, one\r\n alternative, which went completely overlooked by the Commission,\r\n as Judge Oakes noted below, is not to build any project at all.\r\n Whether that option is realistic we do not know. Informing the\r\n public and Congress on that score is the function of the impact\r\n statement. In short, the Act requires that bureaucrats not only to\r\n listen to protests, but to avoid projects that have imprudent\r\n environmental impacts. There is no burden of proof for the\r\n objector to overcome.\r\n \r\n      Finally, the Commission's opinion is too imprecise to provide\r\n any helpful insight for Congress, the Council on Environmental\r\n Quality, or the public into what value judgments it made. We know\r\n that the Commission rejected alternatives with less deleterious\r\n environmental consequences on the ground that they were 'more'\r\n costly and 'less' reliable. But we have no reasonably precise\r\n notion of how much reliability and money were gained at the\r\n expense of the destruction of Storm King Mountain. Whether or not\r\n courts may review the Commission's ultimate balance of these\r\n competing considerations, the fact remains that Congress and the\r\n public are entitled to know those judgments. One function of the &#167;\r\n 102 statement is certainly to make explicit the priorities of the\r\n agencies. That purpose is not served where all that is basically\r\n told is that the preferred alternative is cheaper and more\r\n reliable, though involving adverse implications for the\r\n surrounding ecology.\r\n \r\n      If this kind of impact statement is tolerated, then the\r\n mandate of NEPA becomes only a ritual and like the peppercorn a\r\n mere symbol that has no vital meaning. The decision below is, in\r\n other words, the beginning of the demise of the mandate of NEPA.\r\n \r\n      I would grant these petitions.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\r\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\r\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\r\n        <p> Section 101 of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42\r\n U.S.C. &#167; 4331, provides in pertinent part:\r\n \r\n       '(b) In order to carry out the policy set forth in this\r\n chapter, it is the continuing responsibility of the Federal\r\n Government to use all practicable means, consistent with other\r\n essential considerations of national policy, to improve and\r\n coordinate Federal plans, functions, programs, and resources to\r\n the end that the Nation may&#8212;&#8212;\r\n \r\n       '(1) fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as\r\n trustee of the environment for succeeding generations;\r\n \r\n       '(2) assure for all Americans safe, healthful, productive,\r\n and esthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings;\r\n \r\n       '(3) attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the\r\n environment without degradation, risk to health or safety, or\r\n other undesirable and unintended consequences;\r\n \r\n       '(4) preserve important historic, cultural, and natural\r\n aspects of our national heritage, and maintain, wherever possible,\r\n an environment which supports diversity and variety of individual\r\n choice.'<sup>2</sup>.In that case we held that the grant of authority to this\r\n Commission to alienate federal water resources does not turn\r\n simply on whether the project will be beneficial to the licensee.\r\n Nor is the test solely whether the region will be able to use the\r\n additional power.

Although it has been conceded that the Act's\r\n requirements were applicable in these proceedings, no further\r\n hearings were held; and no environmental impact statement was\r\n drafted. The Commission approved the project and attempted to\r\n satisfy its procedural duties under &#167; 102 by specifying certain\r\n environmental impact forecasts in its final opinion.\r\n \r\n      The Court of Appeals affirmed over the dissent of Judge Oakes\r\n who thought that the Commission had not discharged its obligations\r\n under NEPA. The majority held that under &#167; 101 the ultimate\r\n balance of energy and environmental values was the responsibility\r\n of the Commission and courts could upset only decisions not\r\n supported by 'substantial evidence.' It also held, with respect to\r\n the procedural requirements of &#167; 102, that the Commission's\r\n hearings, and consultation with other agencies satisfied the\r\n command that a 'systematic, interdisciplinary approach' be\r\n utilized.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> It also found that the Commission's final opinion which\r\n contained its environmental findings would, under the\r\n circumstances, suffice as an environmental impact statement. A\r\n petition for rehearing <i>en banc</i> was denied by an equally divided\r\n court with Judge Timbers dissenting in a short opinion which\r\n expressed doubt as to the validity of the majority's reliance on\r\n the 'substantial evidence' test.\r\n \r\n      I believe the Court of Appeals gave the Act too restrictive a\r\n meaning. As to the Commission's duty to take environmental impacts\r\n into account, Judge Oakes made a strong case for the view that the\r\n Commission (a) misjudged the risk that project construction might\r\n work irreparable injury to one of</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\r\n      <p>Page 931\r\n \r\n three vital water supply systems serving New York City; (b)\r\n underestimated the extent of additional air pollution which would\r\n be generated by nighttime burning of fossil fuels in New York City\r\n in order to generate the power needed to pump the river water to\r\n the reservoir; and (c) generally undervalued environmental\r\n considerations while overvaluing engineering and economic\r\n considerations. Although value judgments are inevitable and even\r\n though the Commission's balancing of environmental costs with\r\n other factors may be entitled to some deference, I share Judge\r\n Timber's doubts that under &#167; 101 the balance struck by an agency\r\n unskilled in environmental matters should be reviewed only through\r\n the lens of the 'substantial evidence' test. Cf. Citizens to\r\n Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108283\"><a href=\"/opinion/108283/citizens-to-preserve-overton-park-inc-v-volpe/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span>, 413, 91 S.Ct. 814,\r\n 28 L.Ed.2d 136 ('If the statutes are to have any meaning, the\r\n Secretary cannot approve the destruction of parkland unless he\r\n finds that alternative routes present unique problems.') (But see\r\n <i>Calvert Cliffs'</i>, 449 F.2d, at 1115.).\r\n \r\n      I also am not satisfied that the procedural obligations under\r\n &#167; 102 were honored. First, the Commission did not draft the impact\r\n statement required by &#167; 102(2)(C). Thus when the Commissioners\r\n deliberated the fate of Storm King Mountain, they did not have\r\n before them a coherent study addressed to the environmental\r\n consequences of the project and alternatives to it. Another panel\r\n of the Second Circuit has recently ruled that the impact statement\r\n must be written <i>before</i> action is taken. Greene County Planning\r\n Board v. FPC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"301436\"><a href=\"/opinion/301436/greene-county-planning-board-v-federal-power-commi/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></a></span> (CA2). Administrators cannot attempt to\r\n comply with the Act by calling their final opinion their impact\r\n statement. True, here the hearings had been completed after the\r\n Act became effective. Yet the Commission could have deferred\r\n decision until its own &#167; 102 statement was prepared.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\r\n      <p>Page 932\r\n \r\n      Second, the Commission's final opinion suggests that its\r\n consideration of environmental issues is required only when\r\n private citizens bring such problems to the agency's attention.\r\n For example, in many passages of its opinion the Commission states\r\n that particular objections to the project had been rejected for\r\n lack of evidence in the administrative record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> This approach\r\n symptomatic of the phenomenon of bureaucratic\r\n 'industry-mindedness'&#8212;wrongly assumed that a presumption of\r\n validity supported the Con Ed proposal and that environmental\r\n groups had a burden of proof to overcome.\r\n \r\n      Similarly, the Commission limited its inquiry primarily to\r\n those program alternatives which had been submitted by the\r\n conservationists opposing the Con Ed project. The agency did not\r\n generate its own alternatives, although Congress charged each\r\n federal agency to represent not only the public interest in\r\n general but also under NEPA to pay particular attention to the\r\n environmental ramifications of its actions. Whether or not\r\n conservationists appear to register dissent, the Commission is\r\n told in &#167; 102(2)(D) to 'study, develop and</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\r\n      <p>Page 933\r\n \r\n describe appropriate alternatives to recommend courses of action.\r\n . . .' The agency is directed to apply its own expertise and\r\n imagination in exploring less drastic alternatives. And, one\r\n alternative, which went completely overlooked by the Commission,\r\n as Judge Oakes noted below, is not to build any project at all.\r\n Whether that option is realistic we do not know. Informing the\r\n public and Congress on that score is the function of the impact\r\n statement. In short, the Act requires that bureaucrats not only to\r\n listen to protests, but to avoid projects that have imprudent\r\n environmental impacts. There is no burden of proof for the\r\n objector to overcome.\r\n \r\n      Finally, the Commission's opinion is too imprecise to provide\r\n any helpful insight for Congress, the Council on Environmental\r\n Quality, or the public into what value judgments it made. We know\r\n that the Commission rejected alternatives with less deleterious\r\n environmental consequences on the ground that they were 'more'\r\n costly and 'less' reliable. But we have no reasonably precise\r\n notion of how much reliability and money were gained at the\r\n expense of the destruction of Storm King Mountain. Whether or not\r\n courts may review the Commission's ultimate balance of these\r\n competing considerations, the fact remains that Congress and the\r\n public are entitled to know those judgments. One function of the &#167;\r\n 102 statement is certainly to make explicit the priorities of the\r\n agencies. That purpose is not served where all that is basically\r\n told is that the preferred alternative is cheaper and more\r\n reliable, though involving adverse implications for the\r\n surrounding ecology.\r\n \r\n      If this kind of impact statement is tolerated, then the\r\n mandate of NEPA becomes only a ritual and like the peppercorn a\r\n mere symbol that has no vital meaning. The decision below is, in\r\n other words, the beginning of the demise of the mandate of NEPA.\r\n \r\n      I would grant these petitions.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\r\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\r\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\r\n        <p> Section 101 of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42\r\n U.S.C. &#167; 4331, provides in pertinent part:\r\n \r\n       '(b) In order to carry out the policy set forth in this\r\n chapter, it is the continuing responsibility of the Federal\r\n Government to use all practicable means, consistent with other\r\n essential considerations of national policy, to improve and\r\n coordinate Federal plans, functions, programs, and resources to\r\n the end that the Nation may&#8212;&#8212;\r\n \r\n       '(1) fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as\r\n trustee of the environment for succeeding generations;\r\n \r\n       '(2) assure for all Americans safe, healthful, productive,\r\n and esthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings;\r\n \r\n       '(3) attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the\r\n environment without degradation, risk to health or safety, or\r\n other undesirable and unintended consequences;\r\n \r\n       '(4) preserve important historic, cultural, and natural\r\n aspects of our national heritage, and maintain, wherever possible,\r\n an environment which supports diversity and variety of individual\r\n choice.'<sup>2</sup>.In that case we held that the grant of authority to this\r\n Commission to alienate federal water resources does not turn\r\n simply on whether the project will be beneficial to the licensee.\r\n Nor is the test solely whether the region will be able to use the\r\n additional power.
