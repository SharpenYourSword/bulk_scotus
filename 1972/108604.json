He was sentenced to death. The conviction was based in large part on written confessions that he had signed five days after his arrest. The petitioner objected to the introduction at trial of these confessions. But the trial court and the Alabama Supreme Court held that the confessions were made voluntarily and were properly received into evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1967 this Court summarily reversed that judgment of the Alabama Supreme Court. Beecher v. Alabama, 389 U.S. 35, 88 S.Ct. 189, 19 L.Ed.2d 35. We said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The uncontradicted facts of record are these. Tennessee      police officers saw the petitioner as he fled into an open      field and fired a bullet into his right leg. He fell, and the      local Chief of Police pressed a loaded gun to his face while      another officer pointed a rifle against the side of his head. The      Police Chief asked him whether he had raped and killed a      white woman. When he said that he had not, the Chief called      him a liar and said, 'If you don't tell the truth I am going      to kill you.' The other officer then fired his rifle next to      the petitioner's ear, and the petitioner immediately      confessed. Later the same day he received an injection to      ease the pain in his leg. He signed something the Chief of      Police described as 'extradition papers' after the officers      told him that 'it would be best . . . to sign the papers      before the gang of people came there and killed' him. He was      then taken by ambulance from Tennessee to Kilby Prison in      Montgomery, Alabama. By June 22, the petitioner's right leg,      which was later amputated, had become so swollen and his      wound so painful that he required an injection of morphine      every four hours. Less than an hour after one of these      injections, two Alabama investigators visited him in the      prison hospital. The medical assistant in charge told the      petitioner to 'cooperate' and, in the petitioner's presence,      he asked the investigators to inform him if the petitioner      did not 'tell them what they wanted to know.' The medical      assistant then left the petitioner alone with the State's      investigators. In the course of a 90-minute 'conversation,'      the investigators prepared two detailed statements similar to      the confession the petitioner had given five days earlier at      gunpoint in Tennessee. Still in a 'kind of slumber' from his      last morphine injection, feverish, and in intense pain, the      petitioner signed the written confessions thus prepared for      him.'

Id., at 38, 88 S.Ct., at 191. For '(t)he petitioner, already wounded by the police, was ordered at gunpoint to speak his guilt or be killed. From that time until he was directed five days later to tell Alabama investigators 'what they wanted to know,' there was 'no break in the stream of events'. Clewis v. State of Texas, 386 U.S. 707, 710, 87 S.Ct. 1338, 1340, 18 L.Ed.2d 423. For he was then still in pain, under the influence of drugs, and at the complete mercy of the prison hospital authorities.'

There, a doctor gave him two large injections of morphine. The petitioner testified that he morphine 'kinda made me feel like I wanted to love somebody; took the pain away; made me feel relaxed.' From then on, the petitioner said, he could remember nothing. But the doctor testified at trial that he had asked the petitioner 'why he did it (the crime).'
