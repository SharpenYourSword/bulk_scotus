And the Solicitor General, speaking for the Secretary, concedes that the pecuniary interest of the United States in the outcome of this case, which would be its aliquot share of any recovery, is not within the ambit of § 404.</p>\n<p>By reason of the Supremacy Clause the judgment below is</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The payment in controversy is in a bank account under the name of petitioner Philpott in trust for Wilkes.</p>\n<p>[2]  N. J. Stat. Ann. § 44:7-14 (a) (Supp. 1972-1973) provides:\n</p>\n<p>\"Every county welfare board shall require, as a condition to granting assistance in any case, that all or any part of the property, either real or personal, of a person applying for old age assistance, be pledged to said county welfare board as a guaranty for the reimbursement of the funds so granted as old age assistance pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. The county welfare board shall take from each applicant a properly acknowledged agreement to reimburse for all advances granted, and pursuant to such agreement, said applicant shall assign to the welfare board, as collateral security for such advances, all or any part of his personal property as the board shall specify.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  Title 42 U. S. C. § 407 provides:\n</p>\n<p>\"The right of any person to any future payment under this subchapter shall not be transferable or assignable, at law or in equity, and none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this subchapter shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.\"</p>\n<p>[4]  Since respondent did not claim a right to the entire federal payment but only to the amount by which its own payments would have been reduced had the federal benefits been received currently rather than retroactively and because the stipulated facts were ambiguous as to when respondent actually began making assistance payments, the court remanded for a determination of the precise amount of respondent's claim.</p>\n<p>[5]  <i>Supra,</i> n. 3.</p>\n<p>[6]  See <i>Savoid</i> v. <i>District of Columbia,</i> 110 U.
