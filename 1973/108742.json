Ga.Code Ann, &#167;&#167; 34&#8212;611 and 34 602.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> The District Court upheld the registration cutoff against appellants' constitutional attack based upon this Court's decision in Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 92 S.Ct. 995, 31 L.Ed.2d 274 (1972). This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State offered extensive evidence to establish 'the need for a 50-day registration cut-off point, given the vagaries and numerous requirements of the Georgia elections laws.' Plaintiffs introduced no evidence. On the basis of the record before it, the District Court concluded that the State had demonstrated 'that the 50-day period is necessary to promote . . . the orderly, accurate, and efficient administration of state and local elections, free from fraud.' (Footnote omitted.) Although the 50-day registration period approaches the outer constitutional limits in this area, we affirm the judgment of the District Court. What was said today in Marston v. Lewis, 410 U.S. 679, at 681, 93 S.Ct. 1211, at 1213, 35 L.Ed.2d 627, is applicable here:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'In the present case, we are confronted with a recent and      amply justifiable legislative judgment that 50 days rather      than 30 is necessary to promote the State's important      interest in accurate voter lists.

I also concurred in the result in Dunn v.

But if 30 days pass constitutional      muster, what of 35 or 45 or 75? The resolution of these      longer measures, less than those today struck down, the Court      leaves, I suspect, to the future.'

In Blumstein, the Court struck down Tennessee's 90-day county durational residency requirement in part, I suppose, because it exceeded the State's 30-day registration period. Had the latter been 60 days, rather than 30, I suspect the Court would have indicated approval of a corresponding 60-day durational residency requirement. See 405 U.S., at 345&#8212;349, 92 S.Ct. at 1004&#8212;1006.

Unlike Arizona, Georgia does not use volunteer deputy registrars, a system that the Court in Marston thought created special problems warranting special treatment. Indeed, the State's expert witness in this case testified that there was something dangerous about using deputy registrars. Nor does Georgia have as late a primary as Arizona. As in Marston, appellees here did not show that it was impossible to increase the size of the registrars' staffs or their operations. Moreover, there was evidence that final lists of registered voters are not prepared until 14 days before the election, which indicates that there is no serious administrative impediment to keeping registration open for a relatively long period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court also relies on an ingenious bootstrap argument that I cannot let pass without comment. The statutes in question in Marston were enacted last year after our decision in Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 92 S.Ct. 995, 31 L.Ed.2d 274 (1972). The Arizona Legislature therefore knew that its limitations on registration could only be justified by the administrative burdens faced by registrars. It knew that insuring the purity of the ballot box and guaranteeing the knowledgeability of voters were not goals that could be permissibly served by time limitations on registration. Id., at 353&#8212;357, 92 S.Ct., at 1008&#8212;1010.

The difficulty is that the Georgia statutes here were adopted nearly a decade ago. The legislative judgment is hardly a recent one. Nor was it made knowing that only administrative difficulties were a justification for durational residency requirements. Even if we would be inclined to defer to a recent and informed legislative determination of necessity, when there is no reason to believe that the legislature made such a determination, deference in that regard is uncalled for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, I believe it important to indicate my view that the decisions today provide no basis for making it more difficult to register by making shorter any existing registration periods, in the absence of compelling evidence of extraordinary new circumstances.
