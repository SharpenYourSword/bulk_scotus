A local police officer approached the crowd and asked them to disperse. The crowed was not interfering with traffic; the officer had received no complaints; and the only person he knew to be bothered by the crowd was himself. The officer attempted to arrest appellant A. B. Thompson for disturbing the peace after A. B. cursed and acted 'real tough.' The officer testified that the crowd 'started around' him and he pulled his gun.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> He left the crowd and returned with two more officers, again attempting to arrest. A. B. after the youth 'hurled a vile obscenity' at him. A. B. resisted and in the resulting scuffle was shot. Along with his brother Leon who entered the scuffle when A. B. was shot and Davis Stewart who was 'riling up the crowd,' A. B. was convicted of riot under a statute the constitutionality of which is here challenged. Mississippi Code &#167; 2361.5-01, subd. A provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'A. A 'riot' is any use of force or violence disturbing the      public peace, or any threat to use such force and violence,      if accompanied by immediate power of execution, by two (2) or      more persons acting together and without authority of law.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants complain of the vagueness and overbreadth in the phrase 'disturbing the public peace.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the court below the 'riot' was underway when the officer returned and attempted to arrest A.

Miss., 269 So.2d 641. Since appellants challenge the facial constitutionality of a statute which, according to the Mississippi Supreme Court, defines the congregation of blacks in this case as a 'riot,' the fact that A. B. and Leon Thompson forcefully resisted the police intervention does not end the case. The fact that their action might fall within the statute if it were constitutionally narrowed, does not negate their ability to challenge the statute. Gooding v.

Miss., 269 So.2d 641. The challenged statute is <i>not</i> like its federal counterpart. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2102, unlike the Mississippi statute, necessitates a clear and present danger of property damage or personal injury.
