New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, <i>supra</i>, at 293, 84 S.Ct. 710. (Black, J., concurring). In my opinion the First Amendment prohibits the use of civil libel laws to impose damages for the discussion of public affairs or criticism of public figures, and this prohibition is in no way dependent upon the results of uncertain speculation as to the 'malicious' mental state of the speaker.
