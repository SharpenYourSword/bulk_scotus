A &amp; &#167; requested the Federal Maritime Commission to guarantee, as it is empowered by law to do, a proposed first mortgage loan from a bank. Before the Commission would extend its guarantee, it required to A &amp; &#167; at least $150,000 of additional private capital. The Commission presented A &amp; B with two options.

To tax that return of capital at ordinary income rates is an extraordinary result, yet one that I recognize to be mandated by the full sweep of United States v. Davis, <i>supra</i>.

It is the      effect of the redemption and not the purpose behind it which      is determinative of dividend equivalence.' <i>Ibid.</i> (Citations      omitted.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting in <i>Davis</i> with the concurrence of THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice BRENNAN, viewed the majority opinion as reading &#167; 302(b)(1) out of the Code:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'When the Court holds it [the redemption under consideration      in <i>Davis</i>] was a dividend, it effectively cancels &#167; 302(b)(1)      from the Code. This result is not a matter of conjecture, for      the Court says that in the case of closely held or one-man      corporations a redemption of stock is 'always' equivalent to      a dividend.' 397 U.S., at 314, 90 S.Ct. 1041.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tax Court's decision in this case abundantly bears out Mr. Justice DOUGLAS' view. In light of the deliberate retention of the 'essentially equivalent to a dividend' language in the 1954 revision of the Code, most courts prior to <i>Davis</i> had assumed that &#167; 302(b)(1) required a factual determination as to the business purpose of the stock redemption.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Had such a factual inquiry been made in this case, it is evident that the result would have been different.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the presence of a legitimate business purpose and the absence of any evidence of tax evasion, the preferred stock in question here was nondividend paying&#8212;a highly unusual provision for a preferred stock. Thus petitioners, having been induced by the Commission to advance additional private capital to A &amp; S, found themselves either locked in without income on their investment or compelled, as the price of recouping it, to pay taxes at ordinary income rates on a nonexistent gain. It is difficult to think of a more unjust result, and yet this is the inevitable consequence of the sweeping<i>Davis</i> requirement that a redemption 'always' be deemed 'essentially equivalent to a dividend' in the absence of 'a change in the relative economic interests or rights of the stockholders.' 397 U.S., at 307, 313, 90 S.Ct. 1041.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One may recognize the tax avoidance concern underlying the Court's opinion in <i>Davis</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> without concluding that the only remedy with respect to closely-held corporations is 'always' to tax stock redemptions as dividends without regard to facts and circumstances. It may indeed have been reasonable to create a rebuttable presumption in favor of the Government, but it is difficult to see a justification for a result as harsh and inequitable as that often produced by the <i>Davis</i> rule. Moreover, if Congress' purpose was to enact the <i>Davis per se</i> rule, it could have been expressed in the simplest language.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> As the Court notes in <i>Davis</i>, the Senate Finance Committee deliberately chose not to take that option. 397 U.S., at 310-311, 90 S.Ct. 1041.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view the <i>Davis</i> rule, often a trap for unwary investors in small businesses and facially contrary to the relevant Code provision, should be reconsidered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> One may understand the desire of petitioners to have their capital contributions returned, as the preferred stock was nondividend paying.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> I am not unaware of the importance of <i>stare decisis</i>, especially with respect to the tax code. Yet, even in the tax area, the Court has recognized that the policies underlying <i>stare decisis</i> do not require 'adherence to the latest decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinstically sounder, and verified by experience.' Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Hallock et al., 309 U.S. 106, 119, 60 S.Ct. 444, 84 L.Ed. 604 (1940).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The section treats such redemptions as tax recognizable exchanges of stock, which generally means that the capital gains provisions are applicable, to the extent that there is any return above basis.

But even where it can fairly be said (and often the facts as to this are ambiguous) that there has been no such change, this does not mean that minority stockholders are not severely penalized by the <i>Davis</i> rule. In this case, the Tax Court noted that the redemption was made at the insistence of petitioners, who were in the unhappy position of the holding nondividend preferred stock. But nothing in <i>Davis</i> protects a minority stockholder in a close corporation (and their number is legion) who may have little or no influence as to whether or when preferred stock is redeemed. If the majority shareholders in such a corporation effect a <i>pro rata</i> redemption, a minority shareholder has no means to avoid <i>Davis</i> consequences. In this connection, the language of the Senate Finance Committee in restoring the 'essentially equivalent' language to &#167; 302 of the Code is relevant. The Senate Committee stated that the House bill, which had deleted this language, 'appeared unnecessarily restrictive, particularly, in the case of redemptions of preferred stock which might be called by the corporation without the shareholder having any control over when the redemption may take place.' S.Rep.No.1622, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 1954 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 4675. See United States v. Davis, <i>supra</i>, 397 U.S., AT 310, 90 S.Ct. 1041.

With all respect, this suggestion seems unrealistic. Congress has had under consideration during this period a general revision of the Code as well as a broad reexamination of many of the fundamental assumptions underlying the present Code. It is unlikely that piecemeal adjustments would have been made during this period of study and reexamination. Furthermore, the <i>Davis</i> rule falls most heavily on small, family corporations unlikely to have specialized tax counsel capable of warning that <i>Davis</i> has converted &#167; 302(b)(1) into 'a treacherous route to be employed only as a last resort.' B. Bittker &amp; J. Eustice, <i>supra</i>, at 9-9.

This result is not a matter of conjecture, for      the Court says that in the case of closely held or one-man      corporations a redemption of stock is 'always' equivalent to      a dividend.' 397 U.S., at 314, 90 S.Ct. 1041.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tax Court's decision in this case abundantly bears out Mr. Justice DOUGLAS' view. In light of the deliberate retention of the 'essentially equivalent to a dividend' language in the 1954 revision of the Code, most courts prior to <i>Davis</i> had assumed that &#167; 302(b)(1) required a factual determination as to the business purpose of the stock redemption.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Had such a factual inquiry been made in this case, it is evident that the result would have been different.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the presence of a legitimate business purpose and the absence of any evidence of tax evasion, the preferred stock in question here was nondividend paying&#8212;a highly unusual provision for a preferred stock. Thus petitioners, having been induced by the Commission to advance additional private capital to A &amp; S, found themselves either locked in without income on their investment or compelled, as the price of recouping it, to pay taxes at ordinary income rates on a nonexistent gain. It is difficult to think of a more unjust result, and yet this is the inevitable consequence of the sweeping<i>Davis</i> requirement that a redemption 'always' be deemed 'essentially equivalent to a dividend' in the absence of 'a change in the relative economic interests or rights of the stockholders.' 397 U.S., at 307, 313, 90 S.Ct. 1041.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One may recognize the tax avoidance concern underlying the Court's opinion in <i>Davis</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> without concluding that the only remedy with respect to closely-held corporations is 'always' to tax stock redemptions as dividends without regard to facts and circumstances. It may indeed have been reasonable to create a rebuttable presumption in favor of the Government, but it is difficult to see a justification for a result as harsh and inequitable as that often produced by the <i>Davis</i> rule. Moreover, if Congress' purpose was to enact the <i>Davis per se</i> rule, it could have been expressed in the simplest language.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> As the Court notes in <i>Davis</i>, the Senate Finance Committee deliberately chose not to take that option. 397 U.S., at 310-311, 90 S.Ct. 1041.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view the <i>Davis</i> rule, often a trap for unwary investors in small businesses and facially contrary to the relevant Code provision, should be reconsidered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> One may understand the desire of petitioners to have their capital contributions returned, as the preferred stock was nondividend paying.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> I am not unaware of the importance of <i>stare decisis</i>, especially with respect to the tax code.

But even where it can fairly be said (and often the facts as to this are ambiguous) that there has been no such change, this does not mean that minority stockholders are not severely penalized by the <i>Davis</i> rule. In this case, the Tax Court noted that the redemption was made at the insistence of petitioners, who were in the unhappy position of the holding nondividend preferred stock. But nothing in <i>Davis</i> protects a minority stockholder in a close corporation (and their number is legion) who may have little or no influence as to whether or when preferred stock is redeemed. If the majority shareholders in such a corporation effect a <i>pro rata</i> redemption, a minority shareholder has no means to avoid <i>Davis</i> consequences. In this connection, the language of the Senate Finance Committee in restoring the 'essentially equivalent' language to &#167; 302 of the Code is relevant. The Senate Committee stated that the House bill, which had deleted this language, 'appeared unnecessarily restrictive, particularly, in the case of redemptions of preferred stock which might be called by the corporation without the shareholder having any control over when the redemption may take place.' S.Rep.No.1622, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 1954 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 4675. See United States v. Davis, <i>supra</i>, 397 U.S., AT 310, 90 S.Ct. 1041. The truth is that minority shareholders, even in close corporations, frequently have no such control.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> See B.

With all respect, this suggestion seems unrealistic. Congress has had under consideration during this period a general revision of the Code as well as a broad reexamination of many of the fundamental assumptions underlying the present Code. It is unlikely that piecemeal adjustments would have been made during this period of study and reexamination. Furthermore, the <i>Davis</i> rule falls most heavily on small, family corporations unlikely to have specialized tax counsel capable of warning that <i>Davis</i> has converted &#167; 302(b)(1) into 'a treacherous route to be employed only as a last resort.' B. Bittker &amp; J. Eustice, <i>supra</i>, at 9-9. It is these very corporations that are least likely to make their voices heard in Congress, since they have limited 'lobbying' capabilities.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ", "id": 108941, "judges": "", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/108941/", "sha1": "9fa3c8c7e4af09eaafa91ab932b79eaf3dba642c", "source": "R", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T10:11:47"}
