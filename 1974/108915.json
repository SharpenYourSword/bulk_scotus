While we undoubtedly have authority to waive the application of particular rules in appropriate circumstances, we have during this Term denied a considerable number of similar motions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> Typically in each of these cases the moving petitioner made generalized allegations of inability to afford payment of printing costs, but made not showing sufficient to comply with Rule 53 governing proceedings in forma pauperis.

They are required to be the product of a process 'capable of producing a clear black image on white paper,' and to conform to the paper-size, binding, and type-size requirements also set forth in the Rule.
