Snow, who had advanced part of the capital in a partnership formed in 1966 to develop a special-purpose incinerator and had become a limited partner, was disallowed a deduction under &#167; 174(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, on his individual income tax return for that year for his pro rata share of the partnership's operating loss. Though there were no sales in 1966, expectations were high and the inventor-partner was giving about a third of his time to the project, an outside engineering firm doing the shopwork. The Tax Court and the Court of Appeals both upheld disallowance of the deduction, which &#167; 174(a)(1) provides for 'experimental expenditures which are paid or incurred by (the taxpayer) during the taxable year in connection with his trade or business as expenses which are not chargeable to capital account.' Held: It was error to disallow the deduction, which was 'in connection with' petitioner's trade or business, and the disallowance was contrary to the broad legislative objective of the Congress when it enacted &#167; 174 to provide an economic incentive, especially for small and growing businesses, to engage in the search for new products and new inventions.

Petitioner Edwin A. Snow (hereafter petitioner) was disallowed as a deduction his distributive share of the net operating loss of a partnership, Burns Investment Company, for the taxable year 1966. The United States Tax Court sustained the Commissioner, 58 T.C. 585. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, 482 F.2d 1029 (1973).
