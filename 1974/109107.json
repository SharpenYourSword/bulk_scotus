Section 418A grants jurisdiction to the circuit courts to enjoin the sale or distribution of any publication which is 'obscene' within the meaning of &#167; 418. Section 418 provides in pertinent part as follows: 'Every person who knowingly sends or causes to be sent, . . . into this State, or . . . distributes . . . any obscene material is guilty of a misdemeanor.' As respondent concedes, the Maryland courts have defined the term 'obscenity' in this section by adopting the test set forth in Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498.
