On the same day the Circuit Court entered a temporary restraining order with a notice and summons to appear for a hearing on a temporary injunction. Additionally, a subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> issued, ordering appellee to produce before the Court the film 'Deep Throat' and all other motion pictures in his possession, and also a list of the titles and play dates of all motion pictures exhibited by him over the past three years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor was proceeding under the Indiana obscenity public nuisance statute, <i>supra</i>. The Statute provides that a place which exhibits obscene films is a public nuisance,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and provides for a court order requiring the closure for up to one year of any place determined to be a public nuisance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> An <i>ex parte</i> restraining order may issue up to 10 days without any prior judicial determination of the obscenity of specific films, and a preliminary injunction may issue if after hearing the allegations of the complaint 'are sustained to the satisfaction of the court.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The statute further provides that at trial the 'general reputation of the place' is both admissible and prima facie evidence for proving the existence of the nuisance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> If a nuisance is established at trial, an order closing the theatre for a year and confiscating all personal property and contents therein shall issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The owner of a theatre closed by either preliminary or permanent injunction may obtain a release from the closing order only by posting a bond conditioned on the abatement of the nuisance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 19, 1973, appellee filed suit in the United States District Court. The complaint sought a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2201, 2202 that the statute under which the prosecutor was proceeding was unconstitutional. The complaint also sought to enjoin any further proceedings in the Adams Circuit Court, relief premised on 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. On November 14, 1974, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee and the relief sought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court today vacates the judgment below and remands for consideration in light of its decision last Term in <i>Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd.</i>, 420 U.S. 592, 95 S.Ct. 1200, 43 L.Ed.2d 482 (1975). <i>Huffman</i>, a case involving a similar nuisance statute from Ohio, held that the principles of <i>Younger v. Harris</i>, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), which limit federal court equitable interference with state court criminal proceedings, are also applicable to certain state court proceedings which are 'in aid of and closely related to criminal statutes . . ..' 420 U.S., at 604, 95 S.Ct. 1200. Accordingly, the Court in <i>Huffman v.

The Court emphasized that the statute provided for the seizure and destruction of materials which had never been judicially determined to be obscene, and for the seizure and destruction of constitutionally protected materials 'merely because they are found in a place which has a reputation of exhibiting obscene films . . ..' <i>Id.</i>, at 495. Furthermore, the Court emphasized, once a closing order has issued, the statutory scheme permits future restraints against exhibition of all films unless the owner first discharges the burden of demonstrating their nonobscenity. And if such a showing is made and a release from the closing order obtained, the owner must thereafter 'determine at his peril what is literally or arguably within the definition of 'nuisance.\" <i>Ibid.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, and of particular significance, the District Court held the definitional section of the statute to be 'flagrantly and patently in violation of express constitutional guarantees.' <i>Id.</i>, at 496. The statute defines as a nuisance a place at which 'lewd, indecent, lascivious or obscene' films are exhibited.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The Court reached its conclusion upon the authority of two Indiana Supreme Court decisions which struck down criminal obscenity statutes employing the same definition on the ground that it was too general in nature under the principles announced in <i>Miller v. California</i>, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973). <i>Mohney v. State</i>, Ind., 300 N.E.2d 66 (1973); <i>Stroud v.

This exception, first fashioned in <i>Watson v. Buck</i>, 313 U.S. 387, 402, 61 S.Ct. 962, 85 L.Ed. 1416 (1941), and reaffirmed in <i>Younger, supra</i>, 401 U.S. at 53-54, 91 S.Ct. 746, was twice recognized in <i>Huffman</i> itself, 420 U.S., at 602, 611, 95 S.Ct. 1200. Therefore the judgment of the District Court should be affirmed. The Court's remand to require the District Court to do over what it has done already makes no sense whatever.

In sharp contrast, Indiana court decisions have not narrowed the scope of the Indiana nuisance statute and the Indiana Supreme Court, in the two decisions relied upon by the District Court, has held that the same definition of obscenity appearing in Indiana's criminal obscenity statutes does not satisfy the specificity standards of <i>Miller</i>.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ", "id": 109366, "judges": "", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/109366/", "sha1": "16f007ac76c5beca1844572db4b17078065cc658", "source": "R", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T10:12:03"}
