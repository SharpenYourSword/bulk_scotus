As the en banc opinion of the Court of Appeals amply demonstrates, no special circumstances here dictate the use of multimember districts. Thus, we hold that in shaping remedial relief the District Court abused <span class=\"star-pagination\">*640</span> its discretion in not initially ordering a single-member reapportionment plan.</p>\n<p>On this basis, the judgment is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, concurring.</p>\n<p>I consider it unnecessary to reach the question discussed, <i>ante,</i> at 638-639, n. 6. It was, as the Court observes in n. 6, \"not raised by the petitioners, nor did respondent file a cross-petition.\" The scope of § 5 of the Voting Rights Act is an important matter, and I would not undertake to express any view on what the Court discusses by way of dicta in n. 6.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  <i>Paul R. Dimond</i> and <i>William E. Caldwell</i> filed a brief for the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law as <i>amicus curiae.</i></p>\n<p>[1]  In Louisiana, the police jury is the governing body of the parish. Its authority includes construction and repair of roads, levying taxes to defray parish expenses, providing for the public health, and performing other duties related to public health and welfare. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 33:1236 (1950 and Supp. 1975).</p>\n<p>[2]  Prior to 1968, Louisiana law prohibited at-large elections of members of police juries and school boards. In July 1968, the Governor of Louisiana approved enabling legislation permitting the at-large election of parish police juries and school boards. La. Laws 1968, Act No. 445, codified at La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 33:1221, 33:1224 (Supp. 1975); La. Laws 1968, Act No. 561, codified at La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 17:71.1-17:71.6 (Supp. 1975).\n</p>\n<p>Both Acts were submitted to the United States Attorney General pursuant to § 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 439, as amended, 42 U. S. C. § 1973c, and both were rejected because of their discriminatory effect on Negro voters. See letters, June 26, 1969, and Sept. 10, 1969, from Jerris Leonard, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division, to Jack P. F. Gremillion, Attorney General of Louisiana. Indeed, East Carroll Parish was cited as exemplifying the dilution in black ballot strength that at-large voting may cause. Letter of Sept. 10, 1969.</p>\n<p>[3]  The original plaintiff, Zimmer, was allowed to withdraw from the case.</p>\n<p>[4]  <i>Zimmer</i> v. <i>McKeithen,</i> 467 F. 2d 1381 (CA5 1972).\n</p>\n<p>During pendency of the appeal in the court below, the District Court purported to withdraw its order approving the at-large plan and to substitute in its stead a complex redistricting plan submitted by intervenor Marshall. The Court of Appeals vacated the order on the ground that when the appeal was filed, the District Court lost jurisdiction over the case. <i>Id.,</i> at 1382.</p>\n<p>[5]  <i>Zimmer</i> v. <i>McKeithen,</i> 485 F. 2d 1297 (CA5 1973).</p>\n<p>[6]  The Government has filed an <i>amicus</i> brief, in which it argues that the preclearance procedures of § 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, must be complied with prior to adoption by a federal district court of a reapportionment plan submitted to it on behalf of a local legislative body that is covered by the Act. This issue was not raised by the petitioners nor did respondent file a cross-petition. In any event, we agree with the Court of Appeals, <i>Zimmer</i> v. <i>McKeithen,</i> 467 F. 2d, at 1383; <i>Zimmer</i> v. <i>McKeithen,</i> 485 F. 2d, at 1302 n. 9, that court-ordered plans resulting from equitable jurisdiction over adversary proceedings are not controlled by § 5. Had the East Carroll police jury reapportioned itself on its own authority, clearance under § 5 of the Voting Rights Act would clearly have been required. <i>Connor</i> v. <i>Waller,</i> 421 U. S. 656 (1975). However, in submitting the plan to the District Court, the jury did not purport to reapportion itself in accordance with the 1968 enabling legislation, see n. 2, <i>supra,</i> and statutes cited therein, which permitted police juries and school boards to adopt at-large elections. App. 56. Moreover, since the Louisiana enabling legislation was opposed by the Attorney General of the United States under § 5 of the Voting Rights Act, the jury did not have the authority to reapportion itself. See n. 2, <i>supra;</i> Tr. of Oral Arg. 13-14, 31-32, 43-44. Since the reapportionment scheme was submitted and adopted pursuant to court order, the preclearance procedures of § 5 do not apply. <i>Connor</i> v. <i>Johnson,</i> 402 U. S. 690, 691 (1971).</p>\n\n</div>", "id": 109397, "judges": "Per Curiam", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/109397/", "sha1": "1685bbb5a1b7698f71fd26f1f5eba562bfbca980", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": "1975-051", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T10:12:05"}
