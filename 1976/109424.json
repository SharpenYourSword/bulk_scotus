It is undisputed that, at no time, did the parole officer advise Gallagher that he had a right to remain silent or that any statements he made would be used as evidence against him.

In its opinion, the state court defined the question presented by respondent's appeal as \"whether testimony, concerning certain statements made by (respondent) to his parole officer about his involvement in a crime, was received at trial in violation of (respondent's) privilege against self-incrimination, as guaranteed by &#167; of the Ohio Constitution, and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\" Id., at 294, 313 N.E.2d, at 398-399. The Ohio Supreme Court held that testimony relating the statements of an accused in response to questions by his parole officer is inadmissible at trial if, prior to the questioning, the parole officer failed to advise the accused of his right to remain silent and his right to be provided with counsel prior to questioning, and to warn him that any statement might be used as evidence against him.

Deaton, 468 F.2d 541 (1972), a case which, in the view of the state court, presented the precise question then before it. We are unsure whether the Ohio court made reference to Deaton merely to lend support to its view that a parolee is under heavy pressure to cooperate with his parole officer or whether the court intended to demonstrate its reliance on a federal constitutional ground.
