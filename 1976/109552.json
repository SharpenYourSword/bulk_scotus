In an unpublished order, the Court of Appeals summarily affirmed the judgment of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early January 1975, police officers received a tip from an informant that Moore and others were in possession of heroin at \"Moore's apartment.\" The police obtained a search warrant and entered the apartment, where they found Moore lying face down near a coffee table in the living room. Also present in the apartment was a woman who was sitting on a couch in the same room.

Indeed, one police officer testified that he did not find \"any indications of ownership of the apartment.\" In his closing argument on the merits, however, the prosecutor placed substantial emphasis on the out-of-court declaration of the unidentified informant:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"(A) confidential informant came to Detective Uribe and said,      'I have information or I have through personal observation,      know that John David Moore resides at a certain apartment      here in El Paso, Texas, and he is in possession of a certain      amount of heroin.' \"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In adjudging Moore guilty, the trial court found that he had been in close proximity to the seized heroin, that he was the tenant of the apartment in question, and that he had, therefore, been in possession of the contraband. In making these findings, the court expressly relied on the hearsay declaration of the informant:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Information revealed by the confidential informant and      relied upon in the preparation of the Affidavit disclosed      that John David Moore was the occupant of Apartment # 60,      Building # 7, Hill Country Apartments, 213 Argonaut, El Paso,      Texas.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel objected to the court's reliance upon hearsay evidence, but the judge refused to amend this finding except to add the phrase \"at the time of the seizure\" to the end of the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There can be no doubt that the informant's out-of-court declaration that the apartment in question was \"Moore's apartment,\" either as related in the search warrant affidavit or as reiterated in live testimony by the police officers, was hearsay and thus inadmissible in evidence on the issue of Moore's guilt. Introduction of this testimony deprived Moore of the opportunity to cross-examine the informant as to exactly what he meant by \"Moore's apartment,\" and what factual basis, if any, there was for believing that Moore was a tenant or regular resident there. Moore was similarly deprived of the chance to show that the witness' recollection was erroneous or that he was not credible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The informant's declaration falls within no exception to the hearsay rule recognized in the Federal Rules of Evidence, and reliance on this hearsay statement in determining petitioner's guilt or innocence was error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the only competent evidence of Moore's possession of the narcotics was his proximity to them in an apartment in which another person was also present and of which he was not shown to be the tenant or even a regular resident, the Solicitor General now argues that the error in admitting the hearsay evidence was harmless. That is far from clear.
