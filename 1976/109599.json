United States, 156 U.S. 432, 453, 15 S.Ct. 394, 39 L.Ed. 481 (1895). \"There can be no equal justice where the kind of trial a man gets depends on the amount of money he has.\" Griffin v.

In essence, the appellate court reasoned that petitioner was not harmed by his appearance in jail clothing because he was also deprived of the presumption of innocence by other actions taken by the trial court. Specifically, the Court of Appeal recognized that the California procedure of permitting a manslaughter defendant<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> to be tried on an information alleging murder, allowing the prosecutor to argue to the jury that a murder was committed, and instructing the jury on the elements of first- and second-degree murder, inevitably taints the defendant in the eyes of the jury. The appellate court felt constrained to approve this procedure because of California Supreme Court precedent:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"By following the California Supreme Court mandate and      permitting defendant to be tried on an information alleging      murder, by receiving evidence of murder, and by its      instructions to the jury, the trial court informed the jury      that this was not the run-of-the-mill defendant. The damage      done by defendant's appearance in jail clothing was      accomplished by a procedure held valid by our Supreme Court.      Any error in denying defendant's motion for civilian clothing      thus did not further prejudice him.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This reasoning transforms the harmless error rule of Chapman into the legal equivalent of the doctrine that two wrongs make a right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court has never passed on the prejudicial and unnecessary<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> procedure that the appellate court thought rendered the error here harmless. But in Price v. Georgia, 398 U.S. 323, 90 S.Ct. 1757, 26 L.Ed.2d 300 (1970), we did reject a harmlessness claim in a case almost identical to petitioner's. In Price, the defendant's first trial had ended in an acquittal on a murder charge and a conviction on a manslaughter charge; the conviction was reversed on appeal. The defendant then was retried on the murder charge and again convicted only of manslaughter. The State argued that any error in retrying the defendant for murder was harmless in light of the fact that he was acquitted of the murder charge at the second trial. That argument was rejected, in part because the defendant had improperly been made to suffer the trauma and risk of a second murder trial. But the Court considered \"perhaps of more importance\" the fact that it could \"not determine whether or not the murder charge against petitioner induced the jury to find him guilty of the less serious offense of voluntary manslaughter rather than to continue to debate his innocence. See United States ex rel. Hetenyi v. Wilkins, 348 F.2d 844 (C.A.2 1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 913, 86 S.Ct. 896, 15 L.Ed.2d 667 (1966).\" 398 U.S., at 331-332, 90 S.Ct. 1757. Although there is no possibility here that the jury compromised on the manslaughter conviction since it was instructed that it could return no verdict higher than manslaughter, a similar flaw inheres in the California procedure. It is simply impossible to say that submitting to the jury a heinous crime for which petitioner was not on trial and of which he could not have been convicted might not have \"induced the jury to find him guilty of the less serious offense of voluntary manslaughter rather than to continue to debate his innocence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would grant the writ of certiorari.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Brief of Respondent, at 27-28.
