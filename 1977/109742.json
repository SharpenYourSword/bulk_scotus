They contend essentially that the tariffs violate their rights to due process and equal protection guaranteed by the Fournteenth Amendment because appellee issued them on the basis of findings unsupported by any evidence in the record. We have been informed by the parties that subsequent to the filing of the juristictional statement with this Court appelle reopened its proceedings at appellants' request and is conducting additional evidentiary hearings concering the contested regulations. These hearings may remove the basis for, or significantly alter the nature of, appellants' constitutional attack. Consequently, we dismiss the appeal without prejudice to appellants' raising of any appropiate federal claims following the completion of the additional proceedings. See <i>Boston &amp; M. R.

The statutory distinction, drawn by Congress, between certiorari and appeal would seem to require no less.  While this Court's dismissal of the appeal in <i>Boston &amp; M. R. Co. v. United States</i>, 358 U.S. 68, 79 S.Ct. 107, 3 L.Ed.2d 34 (1958), may be justified as an exercise of our supervisory power over the lower federal courts, a proper respect for the independence of the state systems requires that as a general rule we deal with appeals from their judgments on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Art.
