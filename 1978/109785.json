Silver,</i> 280 U.S. 117, 123, 50 S.Ct. 57, 74 L.Ed. 221 (1929).  While that decision for a while foreclosed federal equal protection challenges to the guest statutes of the various States, in recent years the issue of the constitutional validity of these statutes has been frequently litigated in state courts with conflicting results.  Since 1971 the highest courts of no fewer than 6 States have concluded that their guest statutes violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> while during the same period similar statutes have been upheld against federal constitutional attack in 10 States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Typical of those decisions striking down the guest statutes is <i>Brown v. Merlo,</i> 8 Cal.3d 855, 106 Cal.Rptr. 388, 506 P.2d 212 (1973), in which the California Supreme Court concluded that the classifications created by the challenged statute between those denied and those permitted recovery for negligently inflicted injuries did not bear a substantial and rational relation to the statute's purposes of protecting the hospitality of the host driver and of preventing collusive lawsuits.  <i>Silver v. Silver</i> was expressly distinguished as involving different equal protection considerations.  In contrast,, the Oregon Supreme Court, among others, has held that the hospitality rationale does support the distinctions drawn by the State's guest statute. <i>Duerst v.

In each of the last three Terms, we have been asked to consider whether a state or federal court had correctly determined that a state guest statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, and on each occasion we declined to grant plenary consideration of the question.  <i>Sidle v.

We nevertheless dismissed in these two instances for want of a substantial federal question, thus ruling on the merits of the equal protection issue, <i>Hicks v.
