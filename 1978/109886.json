IV, &#167; 2, cl. 1, and under the Fourteenth Amendment, to New Mexico's statutes requiring licenses to hunt game in that State.  A three-judge United States District Court upheld the State's statutory provisions insofar as they imposed higher license fees for nonresidents than for residents, but the court also ruled that the statutes governing the allocation of licenses to hunt certain rare species of game were unconstitutional.  Plaintiff-appellant Terk, a Texas resident, appeals from that portion of the District Court's judgment that upheld the New Mexico fee discrimination.
