The situation came to a head about six weeks before her dismissal.  An informal conference was arranged and respondent, accompanied by her counsel, met with several school administrators to discuss her performance as a teacher.  Although the meeting lasted for some time, it was confined primarily to an extensive cross-examination by respondent's counsel of the school administrators.  The meeting was terminated inconclusively because respondent's counsel insisted upon a \"specific written statement of charges\" as a precondition of his client's full participation in the meeting and \"never allowed her to speak.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After conferring among themselves, the administrators, petitioners here, decided that the problems arising from respondent's conduct were sufficiently severe to merit an immediate recommendation of dismissal to the Board of Education.
