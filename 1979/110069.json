Respondents in <i>Elkins</i> represented a class of nonimmigrant alien residents of Maryland who either held or were financially dependent upon a person who held a \"G-4 visa,\" that is, a nonimmigrant visa granted to \"officers, or employees of  . . .  international organizations, and the members of their immediate families\" pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(15)(G)(iv).  Respondents were not granted \"in-state\" status for tuition purposes at the University of Maryland because they were conclusively presumed by the University to be nondomiciliaries of the State.  Respondents brought suit against the University and its President, alleging that the University's failure to grant respondents in-state status violated various federal laws, the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Supremacy Clause.  The District Court held for respondents on the ground that the University's procedures for determining in-state status violated principles established in <i>Vlandis v. Kline,</i> 412 U.S. 441, 93 S.Ct. 2230, 37 L.Ed.2d 63 (1973), and the Court of Appeals affirmed.   <i>Moreno v.
