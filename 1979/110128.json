They stopped and asked appellant to identify himself and explain what he was doing.  One officer testified that he stopped appellant because the situation \"looked suspicious and we had never seen that subject in that area before.\"  The officers did not claim to suspect appellant of any specific misconduct, nor did they have any reason to believe that he was armed.  When appellant refused to identify himself, he was arrested for violation of a Texas statute which makes it a criminal act for a person to refuse to give his name and address to an officer \"who has lawfully stopped him and requested the information.\"  Appellant's motion to set aside an information charging him with violation of the statute on the ground that the statute violated the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments was denied, and he was convicted and fined.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Held</i> :  The application of the Texas statute to detain appellant and require him to identify himself violated the Fourth Amendment because the officers lacked any reasonable suspicion to believe that appellant was engaged or had engaged in criminal conduct.  Detaining appellant to require him to identify himself constituted a seizure of his person subject to the requirement of the Fourth Amendment that the seizure be \"reasonable.\"  Cf. <i>Terry v. Ohio</i>, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889;  <i>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce</i>, 422 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607. The Fourth Amendment requires that such a seizure be based on specific, objective facts indicating that society's legitimate interests require such action, or that the seizure be carried out pursuant to a plan embodying explicit, neutral limitations on the conduct of individual officers.  <i>Delaware v. Prouse</i>, 440 U.S. 648, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660.  Here, the State does not contend that appellant was stopped pursuant to a practice embodying neutral criteria, and the officers' actions were not justified on the ground that they had a reasonable suspicion, based on objective facts, that he was involved in criminal activity. Absent any basis for suspecting appellant of misconduct, the balance between the public interest in crime prevention and appellant's right to personal security and privacy tilts in favor of freedom from police interference.

Appellant was convicted in the El Paso Municipal Court and fined $20 plus court costs for violation of &#167; 38.02.  He then exercised his right under Texas law to a trial <i>de novo</i> in the El Paso County Court.  There, he moved to set aside the information on the ground that &#167; 38.02(a) of the Texas Penal Code violated the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments and was unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Accordingly, the County Court's rejection of appellant's constitutional claims was a decision \"by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1257(2).

In convicting appellant, the County Court necessarily found as a matter of fact that the officers \"lawfully stopped\" appellant. See Tex.Penal Code Ann., Tit. 8, &#167; 38.02 (1974).  The Fourth Amendment, of course, \"applies to all seizures of the person, including seizures that involve only a brief detention short of traditional arrest.   <i>Davis v. Mississippi</i>, 394 U.S. 721, 89 S.Ct. 1394, 22 L.Ed.2d 676 (1969);  <i>Terry v.

Ohio</i>, 392 U.S. 1, 20, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1878, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), depends \" 'on a balance between the public interest and the individual's right to personal security free from arbitrary interference by law officers.' \"  <i>Pennsylvania v. Mimms</i>, 434 U.S. 106, 109, 98 S.Ct. 330, 332, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977);  <i>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, supra</i>, 422 U.S., at 878, 95 S.Ct., at 2578. Consideration of the constitutionality of such seizures involves a weighing of the gravity of the public concerns served by the seizure, the degree to which the seizure advances the public interest, and the severity of the interference with individual liberty.  See, <i>e. g.</i>, 422 U.S., at 878-883, 95 S.Ct., at 2578-2581.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A central concern in balancing these competing considerations in a variety of settings has been to assure that an individual's reasonable expectation of privacy is not subject to arbitrary invasions solely at the unfettered discretion of officers in the field.  See <i>Delaware v. Prouse</i>, 440 U.S. 648, 654-655, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1396-1397, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979);  <i>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, supra</i>, 422 U.S., at 882, 95 S.Ct., at 2580.  To this end, the Fourth Amendment requires that a seizure must be based on specific, objective facts indicating that society's legitimate interests require the seizure of the particular individual, or that the seizure must be carried out pursuant to a plan embodying explicit, neutral limitations on the conduct of individual officers.  <i>Delaware v. Prouse, supra</i>, at 663, 99 S.Ct., at 1401.  See <i>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte</i>, 428 U.S. 543, 558-562, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 3083-3085, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State does not contend that appellant was stopped pursuant to a practice embodying neutral criteria, but rather maintains that the officers were justified in stopping appellant because they had a \"reasonable, articulable suspicion that a crime had just been, was being, or was about to be committed.\"  We have recognized that in some circumstances an officer may detain a suspect briefly for questioning although he does not have \"probable cause\" to believe that the suspect is involved in criminal activity, as is required for a traditional arrest. <i>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, supra</i>, 422 U.S., at 880-881, 95 S.Ct., at 2580.  See <i>Terry v. Ohio, supra</i>, 392 U.S., at 25-26, 88 S.Ct., at 1882.  However, we have required the officers to have a reasonable suspicion, based on objective facts, that the individual is involved in criminal activity.  <i>Delaware v. Prouse, supra</i>, at 663, 99 S.Ct., at 1401;  <i>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, supra</i> 422 U.S., at 882-883, 95 S.Ct., at 2581; see also <i>Lanzetta v. New Jersey</i>, 306 U.S. 451, 59 S.Ct. 618, 83 L.Ed. 888 (1939).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The flaw in the State's case is that none of the circumstances preceding the officers' detention of appellant justified a reasonable suspicion that he was involved in criminal conduct. Officer Venegas testified at appellant's trial that the situation in the alley \"looked suspicious,\" but he was unable to point to any facts supporting that conclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  There is no indication in the record that it was unusual for people to be in the alley.  The fact that appellant was in a neighborhood frequented by drug users, standing alone, is not a basis for concluding that appellant himself was engaged in criminal conduct.  In short, the appellant's activity was no different from the activity of other pedestrians in that neighborhood.  When pressed, Officer Venegas acknowledged that the only reason he stopped appellant was to ascertain his identity.  The record suggests an understandable desire to assert a police presence;  however, that purpose does not negate Fourth Amendment guarantees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the absence of any basis for suspecting appellant of misconduct, the balance between the public interest and appellant's right to personal security and privacy tilts in favor of freedom from police interference.  The Texas statute under which appellant was stopped and required to identify himself is designed to advance a weighty social objective in large metropolitan centers:  prevention of crime.  But even assuming that purpose is served to some degree by stopping and demanding identification from an individual without any specific basis for believing he is involved in criminal activity, the guarantees of the Fourth Amendment do not allow it.  When such a stop is not based on objective criteria, the risk of arbitrary and abusive police practices exceeds tolerable limits.  See <i>Delaware v. Prouse, supra</i>, at 661, 99 S.Ct., at 1400.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The application of Tex.Penal Code Ann., Tit. 8, &#167; 38.02 (1974), to detain appellant and require him to identify himself violated the Fourth Amendment because the officers lacked any reasonable suspicion to believe appellant was engaged or had engaged in criminal conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Accordingly, appellant may not be punished for refusing to identify himself, and the conviction is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Reversed</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"THE COURT:  . . .

In convicting appellant, the County Court necessarily found as a matter of fact that the officers \"lawfully stopped\" appellant. See Tex. Penal Code Ann., Tit. 8, § 38.02 (1974). The Fourth Amendment, of course, \"applies to all seizures of the person, including seizures that involve only a brief detention short of traditional arrest. <i>Davis</i> v. <i>Mississippi,</i> 394 U.

See, <i>e. g.,</i> 422 U.

To this end, the Fourth Amendment requires that a seizure must be based on specific, objective facts indicating that society's legitimate interests require the seizure of the particular individual, or that the seizure must be carried out pursuant to a plan embodying explicit, neutral limitations on the conduct of individual officers. <i>Delaware</i> v. <i>Prouse, supra,</i> at 663. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Martinez-Fuerte,</i> 428 U.

See <i>Terry</i> v. <i>Ohio, supra,</i> at 25-26.

Officer Venegas testified at appellant's trial that the situation in the alley \"looked suspicious,\" but he was unable to point to any facts supporting that conclusion.<sup>[2]</sup> There is no indication in the record that it was unusual for people to be in the alley. The fact that appellant was in a neighborhood frequented by drug users, standing alone, is not a basis for concluding that appellant himself was engaged in criminal conduct. In short, the appellant's activity was no different from the activity of other pedestrians in that neighborhood.

The Texas statute under which appellant was stopped and required to identify himself is designed to advance a weighty social objective in large metropolitan centers: prevention of crime. But even assuming that purpose is served to some degree by stopping and demanding identification from an individual without any specific basis for believing he is involved in criminal activity, the guarantees of the Fourth Amendment do not allow it.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This appeal presents the question whether appellant was validly convicted for refusing to comply with a policeman's demand that he identify himself pursuant to a provision of the Texas Penal Code which makes it a crime to refuse such identification on request.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>At 12:45 in the afternoon of December 9, 1977, Officers Venegas and Sotelo of the El Paso Police Department were cruising in a patrol car. They observed appellant and another man walking in opposite directions away from one another in an alley. Although the two men were a few feet apart when they first were seen, Officer Venegas later testified that both officers believed the two had been together or were about to meet until the patrol car appeared.</p>\n<p>The car entered the alley, and Officer Venegas got out and asked appellant to identify himself and explain what he was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> doing there. The other man was not questioned or detained. The officer testified that he stopped appellant because the situation \"looked suspicious and we had never seen that subject in that area before.\" The area of El Paso where appellant was stopped has a high incidence of drug traffic. However, the officers did not claim to suspect appellant of any specific misconduct, nor did they have any reason to believe that he was armed.</p>\n<p>Appellant refused to identify himself and angrily asserted that the officers had no right to stop him. Officer Venegas replied that he was in a \"high drug problem area\"; Officer Sotelo then \"frisked\" appellant, but found nothing.</p>\n<p>When appellant continued to refuse to identify himself, he was arrested for violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann., Tit. 8, § 38.02 (a) (1974), which makes it a criminal act for a person to refuse to give his name and address to an officer \"who has lawfully stopped him and requested the information.\"<sup>[1]</sup> Following the arrest the officers searched appellant; nothing untoward was found.</p>\n<p>While being taken to the El Paso County Jail appellant identified himself. Nonetheless, he was held in custody and charged with violating § 38.02 (a). When he was booked he was routinely searched a third time. Appellant was convicted in the El Paso Municipal Court and fined $20 plus court costs for violation of § 38.02. He then exercised his right under Texas law to a trial <i>de novo</i> in the El Paso County Court. There, he moved to set aside the information on the ground that § 38.02 (a) of the Texas Penal Code violated the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments and was unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> motion was denied. Appellant waived a jury, and the court convicted him and imposed a fine of $45 plus court costs.</p>\n<p>Under Texas law an appeal from an inferior court to a county court is subject to further review only if a fine exceeding $100 is imposed. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 4.03 (Vernon 1977). Accordingly, the County Court's rejection of appellant's constitutional claims was a decision \"by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had.\" 28 U. S. C. § 1257 (2).
