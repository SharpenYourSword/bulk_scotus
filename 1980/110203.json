He was advised, alternatively, that if he was not certain he was the father, the office would institute a paternity action and serve him with a summons and complaint;  he then would have 30 days to answer and a trial would follow.  Respondent signed a paternity agreement, prepared by Hickman.  It was filed with the Ventura County Superior Court.
