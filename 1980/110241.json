Various school construction decisions were      defended as being responsive to sincere desires of local      residents for neighborhood facilities.  The assignment of      black teachers and administrators to schools with majority      black student enrollments was defended on the ground that      such faculty or staff would be better able to relate to      students of the same race.

However, there remain more than 200 enumerated actions cited in the liability      opinion for which the explanations of the defendants either      were not credible or were not legally permissible.

We have certainly never held that racial balance is constitutionally required once a violation is established.  To the contrary, in <i>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education</i>, 402 U.S. 1, 24, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1280, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971), this Court stated explicitly that, \"[t]he constitutional command to desegregate schools does not mean that every school in every community must always reflect the racial composition of the school system as a whole.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court then either ignored the statement in <i>Swann</i> or formulated this remedy on the hypothesis that had there been no segregative conduct on the part of the Cleveland School Board, there would have been no racially segregated housing patterns in the city of Cleveland.  For the reasons persuasively stated by Mr. Justice POWELL in his opinion dissenting from the dismissal of the writ of certiorari in <i>Estes v. Metropolitan Branch, Dallas NAACP</i>, 444 U.S. 437, 100 S.Ct. 716, 62 L.Ed.2d 626 (1980), this is simply not a realistic hypothesis.  Conceding that there was a systemwide violation, and allowing for the discretion and flexibility necessary for the District Court to fashion an equitable decree which would requite the constitutional wrong, that discretion did not extend to restructuring the entire demography of the city of Cleveland as reflected in its schools, unless that demography was attributable to the conduct of the petitioner school Board.  While the District Court found that some of the racial housing patterns <i>were</i> attributable to the conduct of the Board, it also made clear that other factors, including the location of public housing by entities other than the Board, also had a causative effect.  Even if the Constitution required it, and it were possible for federal courts to do it, no equitable decree can fashion an \"Emerald City\" where all races, ethnic groups, and persons of various income levels live side by side in a large metropolitan area.
