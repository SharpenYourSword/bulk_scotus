In January 1976, petitioner filed an administrative request with the Service to inspect that file, or at least such portions of it as could be segregated from exempt portions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  There were at that time no proceedings pending against petitioner.  His request was denied in its entirety.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  This decision was upheld on administrative appeal and in subsequent judicial proceedings brought under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(a)(4)(B).  During the course of these proceedings, petitioner learned that the file he sought consisted of 225 pages.

Exemption 7(A) states:  \"This section does not apply to matters that are . . . (7) investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such records would (A) interfere with enforcement proceedings. . . .\"  The present language of this Exemption is the result of a 1974 amendment to the Act.  The Act, prior to 1974, had exempted from disclosure all \"investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes.\"  5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(b)(7) (1970 ed.).  In <i>Robbins Tire</i> we surveyed the meaning and scope of Exemption 7(A) in light of the legislative history that led to its narrowing in 1974.  We concluded that the purpose of the 1974 amendment had been \"to eliminate 'blanket exemptions' for Government records simply because they were found in investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes. . . .\"  437 U.S., at 236, 98 S.Ct., at 2323.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court of Appeals decision in this case creates a \"blanket exemption\" for any open Secret Service file.  The court reached this result by means of a novel interpretation of the phrase \"enforcement proceedings\" and a questionable inference from <i>Robbins Tire</i>.  First, the court interpreted \"enforcement proceedings\" to include more than adjudicatory procedures.  It held that because Secret Service investigations are \"directed toward an active and concrete effort to enforce the law,\" 611 F.2d, at 1025, they qualify as \"enforcement proceedings\" under the Act.  Second, <i>Robbins Tire</i> permits agencies to make \"generic determinations\" that disclosure of certain kinds of materials would interfere with enforcement proceedings.  The Court of Appeals held that Secret Service files qualify as such a generic determination.  Thus, any Secret Service file related to an open investigation is wholly exempted, without more, from disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court of Appeals thought that the prophylactic aim of the Secret Service distinguishes it from other law enforcement agencies that conduct \"investigations with a view towards apprehending law-breakers and bringing them to justice.\"  611 F.2d, at 1025.  Clearly, however, other law enforcement agencies have prophylactic goals, and the acts the Secret Service investigates are crimes.  See, <i>e. g.</i>, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 871 (threats against the President are punishable by fine and imprisonment). If Secret Service investigations, without limitation, qualify as enforcement proceedings regardless of whether or not there is an adjudicatory proceeding pending or imminent, then arguably many investigatory files of other law enforcement agencies also qualify for exemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Robbins Tire</i> concluded that a generic determination that disclosure of witness statements prior to unfair labor practice hearings would interfere with those proceedings was permissible under Exemption 7(A).
