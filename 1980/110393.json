The rule discriminates against federal constitutional claims by placing additional burdens on them that are not placed on state-law claims:  the federal constitutional challenge can only be considered if raised as soon as the challenging party becomes aware of the allegedly unconstitutional law;  the state-law challenge can be considered if it is raised at any time prior to entry of a pretrial order.  Such a distinction between federal constitutional and state-law claims belies any genuine state interest in the rule.  At least as long as the constitutional claim is made at a time when the court may consider and decide it without disruption of the proceeding, the state interest in judicial efficiency is served.  The Georgia Supreme Court asserts that a defendant must not be allowed to delay the raising of \"defenses indefinitely in hopes that a decision will be rendered which provides him with an arguable constitutional defense,\" 245 Ga., at 446-447, 265 S.E.2d, at 576-577,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> but surely this rationale is equally applicable to changes in state law.  Similarly, the rationale that requiring early presentation of claims might serve state interests in promoting settlement before trial and apprising parties of the opposing side's case is equally applicable to state-law as well as constitutional claims.  In short, the Georgia Supreme Court's procedural rule effects an unnecessary and irrational discrimination against federal constitutional claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would therefore at least postpone the question of jurisdiction and set the case for oral argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The new Georgia statute, enacted soon after this Court's decision in <i>Orr v.

But <i>Brackett</i> states without further explanation the general proposition that constitutional claims must be raised \"at the first opportunity.\" 227 Ga., at 495, 181 S.E.2d, at 382.  The claim in <i>Brackett</i> was not raised before the start of trial, as here, but after the guilty verdict was returned.  It was this timing the court considered to be too late.  The Encyclopedia states that constitutional claims generally may not be raised after trial, and also comments, that, if the constitutional \"point is apparent at the outset, it may be raised by demurrer or other pleading.\"  &#167; 182, p. 530.  Certainly appellant might properly believe that amending his answer before trial would suffice under this view of the law.</p>\n        <p>Other Georgia cases dealing with the definition of \"at the first opportunity\" similarly fail to support the Georgia Supreme Court's interpretation here.  See, <i>e. g., Woods v. State</i>, 222 Ga. 321, 322, 149 S.E.2d 674, 677 (1966);  <i>Loomis v. State</i>, 203 Ga. 394, 404-405, 47 S.E.2d 58, 64 (1948);  <i>Boyers v.

But <i>Brackett</i> states without further explanation the general proposition that constitutional claims must be raised \"at the first opportunity.\" 227 Ga., at 495, 181 S.E.2d, at 382.  The claim in <i>Brackett</i> was not raised before the start of trial, as here, but after the guilty verdict was returned.  It was this timing the court considered to be too late.  The Encyclopedia states that constitutional claims generally may not be raised after trial, and also comments, that, if the constitutional \"point is apparent at the outset, it may be raised by demurrer or other pleading.\"  &#167; 182, p. 530.  Certainly appellant might properly believe that amending his answer before trial would suffice under this view of the law.</p>\n        <p>Other Georgia cases dealing with the definition of \"at the first opportunity\" similarly fail to support the Georgia Supreme Court's interpretation here.

The statute further states that a \"party may [thereafter] amend his pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the averse party;  and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.\"  Ga.Code &#167; 81A-115(a) (1978). The statute nowhere suggests that constitutional claims will be treated specially.  The Georgia Supreme Court's new rule vitiates the discretion given by the statutory language to the trial judge to grant leave to amend \"when justice so requires.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The trial court itself thought appellant's constitutional claim timely, and gave it full consideration.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Unlike petitioners in <i>Blair</i> and <i>Carpenter</i>, however, since this is a civil case, appellant will have no other federal-court remedy if we refuse to consider his appeal.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Appellant did move for four continuances before the trial began, but there is no evidence of bad-faith dilatory tactics.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Appellee does not appear to contest Allison's claim that the challenged statute is unconstitutional.  Indeed, &#167; 1 of the Family and Domestic Relations Law Amended Act (1979) states:</p>\n        <p>\"It is the intent of this Act to revise and modernize certain laws of this State which relate to intrafamilial duties, rights, and obligations, including laws relating to . . . support of minors . . . so as to comply with those standards of equal protection under the law announced in the United States Supreme Court decision in the case of <i>Orr v.
