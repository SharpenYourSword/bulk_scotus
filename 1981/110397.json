See <i>Martin v. Louisiana</i>, 449 U.S. 998, 101 S.Ct. 540, 66 L.Ed.2d 297 (STEWART, J., dissenting).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia in No. 79-6704, insofar as it left undisturbed the death penalty, and remand the case to that court for further consideration in light of <i>Godfrey v. Georgia</i>, 446 U.S. 420, 100 S.Ct. 1759, 64 L.Ed.2d 398 (1980).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentence of death was imposed in No. 79-6704 upon the basis of the statutory aggravating circumstance involved in the <i>Godfrey</i> case (Ga.Code &#167; 27-2534.1(b)(7) (1978)), and an additional statutory aggravating circumstance.  If, after <i>Godfrey</i>, the Supreme Court of Georgia should decide that the &#167; (b)(7) aggravating circumstance could not constitutionally justify the death sentence, Georgia law would prohibit a further finding that the error was harmless simply because of the existence of the other aggravating circumstance.  Under Georgia's capital sentencing scheme, the trial court is the sentencing authority. Ga.Code &#167;&#167; 27-2503(b), 27-2534.1(b) (1978).  In addition, the sentencer has the power to decline to impose the death penalty even if it finds that one or more statutory aggravating circumstances are present in the case.  See <i>Fleming v. State</i>, 240 Ga. 142, 146-147, 240 S.E.2d 37, 40-41 (1977);  <i>Hawes v. State</i>, 240 Ga. 327, 334-335, 240 S.E.2d 833, 839 (1977).  See also <i>Gregg v. Georgia</i>, 428 U.S. 153, 203, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2939, 49 L.Ed.2d 859.  Thus, under Georgia's capital punishment scheme, only the trial judge or jury can know and determine what to do when upon appellate review it has been concluded that a particular aggravating circumstance should not have been considered in sentencing the defendant to death.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I had thought that it was on the basis of precisely this reasoning that the Court only months ago unanimously acted as it did with respect to four cases which were, in all relevant respects, indistinguishable from this one.  See <i>Davis v. Georgia</i>, 446 U.S. 961, 100 S.Ct. 2934, 64 L.Ed.2d 819;  <i>Collins v. Georgia</i>, 446 U.S. 961, 100 S.Ct. 2936, 64 L.Ed.2d 820;  <i>Baker v. Georgia</i>, 446 U.S. 961, 100 S.Ct. 2936, 64 L.Ed.2d 820;  <i>Hamilton v. Georgia</i>, 446 U.S. 961, 100 S.Ct. 2936, 64 L.Ed.2d 821.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice WHITE, dissenting.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I dissent from the denial of certiorari in these cases.  I would vacate the judgment in each case insofar as it affirmed the imposition of the death sentence, and would remand for reconsideration in light of <i>Godfrey v. Georgia</i>, 446 U.S. 420, 100 S.Ct. 1759, 64 L.Ed.2d 398 (1980).  The judgment in each case was entered prior to our decision in <i>Godfrey</i>.  In each case, the jury found two statutory aggravating circumstances which permit imposition of the death penalty under Georgia law, one of which was that involved in <i>Godfrey</i>.  In each case the Georgia Supreme Court sustained both circumstances in its mandatory review of the sentence.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have remanded such cases before, and we should do so now. This would allow the Georgia Supreme Court in the first instance to determine whether the death penalty should be sustained without regard to the validity of the <i>Godfrey</i> circumstance.  I would not make that determination here, as the Court is apparently doing; for I do not understand the Georgia cases cited by Justice Stevens to hold either that the Georgia Supreme Court is without power to set aside a death penalty if it sustains only one of the aggravating circumstances found by the jury or that, although the court has that power, it invariably will not disturb the death penalty in such situations.  Of course, the Georgia Supreme Court could avoid any such question if on remand it found sufficient grounds to sustain the <i>Godfrey</i> aggravating circumstance.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do I believe that the Constitution requires the Georgia Supreme Court to vacate the sentences if it fails to sustain the <i>Godfrey</i> aggravating circumstance.  The cases now before us involve only sentencing, not guilt or innocence, and there is no constitutional right to jury sentencing.  The imposition of a death sentence, despite a failure to sustain all of the aggravating circumstances found by the jury, does not conflict with either <i>Stromberg v. California</i>, 283 U.S. 359, 51 S.Ct. 532, 75 L.Ed. 1117 (1931), or <i>Street v. New York</i>, 394 U.S. 576, 89 S.Ct. 1354, 22 L.Ed.2d 572 (1969).  The Georgia Supreme Court has held that under Georgia law it has the power to determine whether or not a death sentence should be imposed under these circumstances.  As I see it, this does not violate the United States Constitution.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice STEVENS, concurring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After our decision in <i>Godfrey v.
