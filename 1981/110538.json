Although <i>Doran</i> involved a situation in which the demanding state had already made a judicial determination that probable cause existed, see 439 U.S., at 284, 99 S.Ct., at 533, I perceive no material difference between that case and the present case.  In either situation, an asylum state must look to the \"charge\";  it is not free to substitute its own judgment for the probable-cause determination to be made by the demanding state's courts.  \" 'To allow plenary review in the asylum state of issues that can be fully litigated in the charging state would defeat the plain purposes of the summary and mandatory procedures authorized by Art.

These documents more than satisfied Florida requirements for the commencement of a prosecution, and respondent makes no argument that those requirements are unconstitutional.  Although we would have no occasion in this case to decide whether Alabama could constitutionally require all of these papers,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> it is certain that Alabama was entitled to no more. In overturning an order of the Governor of Alabama which expressly rested on the United States Constitution and which was prima facie evidence \"that the constitutional and statutory requirements have been met,\" <i>Doran</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 289, 99 S.Ct., at 535, the Alabama court based its decision on a strained view of the relevant law. In <i>Doran</i>, we took pains to emphasize that the purpose of the Extradition Clause \"was to preclude any state from becoming a sanctuary for fugitives from justice of another state and thus 'balkanize' the administration of criminal justice among the several states.\"  439 U.S., at 287, 99 S.Ct., at 534.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The papers submitted by Florida plainly show that respondent is charged with a crime in Florida and that he is a fugitive from justice.

Walker</i>,      <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></span>, 87, 101 S.Ct. 308, 309, 66 L.Ed.2d 304 (1980),      quoting <i>Doran</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 289, 99 S.Ct., at 535.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals plainly exceeds the permissible scope of determining \"whether the extradition documents on their face are in order\" and \"whether the defendant has been charged with a crime in the demanding state.\"  Under the guise of simply considering whether the documents were facially in order, the Alabama court actually imposed a requirement that Florida's documents must satisfy the Alabama court's particular view of probable cause to arrest.  Although <i>Doran</i> involved a situation in which the demanding state had already made a judicial determination that probable cause existed, see 439 U.S., at 284, 99 S.Ct., at 533, I perceive no material difference between that case and the present case.  In either situation, an asylum state must look to the \"charge\";  it is not free to substitute its own judgment for the probable-cause determination to be made by the demanding state's courts.  \" 'To allow plenary review in the asylum state of issues that can be fully litigated in the charging state would defeat the plain purposes of the summary and mandatory procedures authorized by Art. IV, &#167; 2.' \"   <i>Pacileo v. Walker</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 88, 101 S.Ct., at 309, quoting <i>Doran</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 290, 99 S.Ct., at 536.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Florida's demand was supported by a verified information charging respondent with felonies allegedly committed by him while he was present in Florida, an arrest warrant, and the affidavit made before the Magistrate.  These documents more than satisfied Florida requirements for the commencement of a prosecution, and respondent makes no argument that those requirements are unconstitutional.  Although we would have no occasion in this case to decide whether Alabama could constitutionally require all of these papers,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> it is certain that Alabama was entitled to no more. In overturning an order of the Governor of Alabama which expressly rested on the United States Constitution and which was prima facie evidence \"that the constitutional and statutory requirements have been met,\" <i>Doran</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 289, 99 S.Ct., at 535, the Alabama court based its decision on a strained view of the relevant law. In <i>Doran</i>, we took pains to emphasize that the purpose of the Extradition Clause \"was to preclude any state from becoming a sanctuary for fugitives from justice of another state and thus 'balkanize' the administration of criminal justice among the several states.\"  439 U.S., at 287, 99 S.Ct., at 534.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The papers submitted by Florida plainly show that respondent is charged with a crime in Florida and that he is a fugitive from justice.
