Petitioner was convicted in state court.  He succeeded in obtaining a reversal of his conviction on appeal and a retrial was ordered.  After several continuances were granted petitioner sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court, alleging that he was being denied his rights to a speedy trial.  The District Court dismissed the action on the ground that petitioner had failed to exhaust available state remedies, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254.  Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  That court agreed that petitioner had failed to exhaust available state remedies, and issued an order specifically denying petitioner's application for a certificate of probable cause to appeal.  Petitioner thereupon sought from this Court a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress has enacted a specific provision governing the right to appeal in cases such as this:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"An appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from      the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding where the      detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court, unless the justice or judge who rendered      the order or a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate      of probable cause.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See also Fed.Rule App.Proc. 22(b) (\"In a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a state court, an appeal by the applicant for the writ may not proceed unless a district or a circuit judge issues a certificate of probable cause\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The effect of this statute which could not have been drafted in plainer terms, is clear:  A certificate of probable cause is an indispensible prerequisite to an appeal in the courts of appeals.
