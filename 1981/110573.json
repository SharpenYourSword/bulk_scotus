This proposition, of course, is not only in accord with its own precedents cited in the opinion, but with our own cases on the subject.  See, <i>e. g., Brown v. Chote</i>, 411 U.S. 452, 457, 93 S.Ct. 1732, 1735, 36 L.Ed.2d 420 (1973).

The preliminary injunction referred to in that opinion was issued by the District Court only after its earlier partial summary judgment in favor of the applicants had been reversed by the Court of Appeals in <i>Lyons v. City of Los Angeles</i>, 615 F.2d 1243 (CA9), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 934, 101 S.Ct. 333, 66 L.Ed.2d 158 (1980) (<i>Lyons I</i> ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its opinion in <i>Lyons I</i>, the Court of Appeals held that respondent had standing to challenge the use by members of the City of Los Angeles Police Department of so-called \"choke-holds\" in situations that are not life threatening.  615 F.2d, at 1246-1249.  Because respondent had once been the subject of such a \"choke-hold,\" the Court of Appeals held that respondent had standing to seek an injunction, even though there was no indication that he would ever be subjected to them again by reason of an arrest by Los Angeles police officers.  \"[T]he threat of future injury to not only Lyons, but to every citizen in the area is much more immediate\" than those described in <i>Rizzo v. Goode</i>, 423 U.S. 362, 96 S.Ct. 598, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976), or <i>O'Shea v.

This is undoubtedly quite true insofar as the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is concerned, but <i>Lyons I</i> is not \"law of the case\" so far as this Court is concerned.  The city petitioned for certiorari to review <i>Lyons I</i>, but its petition was at that time denied.  Justice WHITE, Justice POWELL, and I dissented.  <i>City of Los Angeles v.

The issue to be reviewed, of course, is not whether a preliminary injunction should be affirmed on appeal unless it represents an abuse of discretion, but whether respondent has standing to maintain this action.  On this issue, I think there is enough difference in the approach of the Court of Appeals in this case and the approach of this Court in <i>O'Shea v. Littleton, supra</i>, and <i>Rizzo v.
