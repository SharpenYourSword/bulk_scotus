The Act provides that charges first be brought to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission within 180 days of the alleged violation.  &#167; 2000e-5(e).  If the Commission dismisses the charge or issues a right-to-sue letter, the party may bring an action in federal court within 90 days.  &#167; 2000e-5(f)(1)(A).  Regulations under the Act provide that after 180 days from the filing of a complaint with the Commission, a person can request a right-to-sue notice which \"the Commission shall promptly issue.\"  29 CFR &#167; 1601.28(a) (1980).

That same day petitioner filed her complaint with the Commission.  Although petitioner could have requested a right-to-sue letter 180 days later, she waited for over four years while the Commission pursued the grievance through conciliation.  That process apparently was unsuccessful and, on January 3, 1974, a right-to-sue letter was issued.  Fifteen days later, petitioner filed suit in Federal District Court, which upheld her claim and awarded various prospective relief as well as backpay of over $100,000 dating from the filing of charges in 1969.  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit agreed that the respondent was liable for sex discrimination, but objected to the backpay award because the petitioner allowed her complaint to \"lie dormant\" with the Commission for over four years when she could have obtained a right-to-sue letter upon request.  The District Court was directed, on remand, to reduce the backpay award for the time during which petitioner could have requested a right-to-sue letter from the Commission.  603 F.2d 598, 603.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Circuit has expressly declined to rule that Title VII plaintiffs must make a timely request for a right-to-sue letter or lose the right to substantial backpay relief.

Blue Bell, Inc.</i>, 596 F.2d 1276 (1979), the court reasoned that the plaintiff was entitled to await completion of conciliation efforts before filing suit.  \"A plaintiff cannot be penalized for choosing . . . the legislatively and judicially favored method of relying on the administrative processes of the EEOC.\"  596 F.2d, at 1257.
