Schlitz Brewing Co. in Missouri in 1956.  In 1970, Schlitz offered McCluney the position of plant manager at its facility in North Carolina.  Appellant accepted the position and moved to North Carolina.  In 1975, Schlitz offered McCluney a position as vice president of plant operations at Schlitz' corporate headquarters in Wisconsin.

Appellant's employment contract was a Kansas contract, since that is where he was hired and where he worked.\"  <i>Id.</i>, at 21.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the Court of Appeals expressly held that the employment contract entered by appellant in Missouri in 1956 was discharged in 1970 when appellant accepted a promotion to a position as a plant manager in North Carolina;  the court unequivocally stated that \"[t]his suit is not upon a Missouri contract.\"  C.A. 8, 649 F.2d 578, 583.  The Court of Appeals recognized that in <i>Bliven v. Brunswick Corp.</i>, 575 S.W.2d 788 (Mo.App.1978), the court held that a \"service letter\" was required in a case in which an employee had been hired in Missouri and then transferred to four different States over a 2-year period.  The Court of Appeals specifically distinguished <i>Bliven</i>, however, in concluding that the instant suit was <i>not</i> based upon a Missouri employment contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In light of <i>Horstman</i>, this conclusion of the Court of Appeals strongly suggests that, as a matter of state law, the Missouri service letter statute does not apply in this case.  Without expressly deciding that state law question, however, the Court of Appeals appears to have concluded that an application of the statute to this employment relationship would be unconstitutional.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not our business to decide the proper interpretation of Missouri law;  indeed, we are precluded from considering state law questions in an appeal from a decision of a federal appellate court.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1254(2).  What is critical, however, is that if the Missouri statute was not applicable <i>as a matter of state law</i>, as the Court of Appeals suggests by distinguishing <i>Bliven</i> and by ruling that this case was not based on a Missouri contract, then the Court of Appeals should not have considered whether an application of the Missouri statute would violate due process.

By contrast, we hold that McCluney's 1956 contract was discharged in 1970 when he accepted Schlitz's offer of a promotion to plant manager of the Winston-Salem Plant.  That 1970 contract was, likewise, discharged when McCluney accepted Schlitz's offer of a promotion to vice president of plant operations in Wisconsin in 1975.  The 1975 contract is twice removed from the original 1956 Missouri contract. . . .
