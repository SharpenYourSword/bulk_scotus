Montana,</i> 442 U.S. 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979), this Court held that a defendant's right to due process is violated when the trial judge, charging the jury on the issue of criminal intent, instructs the jury to presume that each person intends the natural consequences of his act.  We left open the possibility that the impermissible effects of such a jury instruction might be \"removed\" by other instructions that are \"rhetorically inconsistent with a conclusive or burden-shifting presumption.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 518-519, n. 7, 99 S.Ct., at 2456, n. 7.  In each of these cases the trial judge gave an instruction concerning intent that was improperly cast in the form of a mandatory presumption.  In each case the Court of Appeals held that the improper instruction was cured by other instructions concerning intent, even though the additional instructions were <i>not</i> rhetorically inconsistent with the improper charge.  I would grant certiorari in order to address this misinterpretation of this Court's decision in <i>Sandstrom.</i> In No. 82-5763, petitioner Edwin Rivera was convicted in state court of first-degree manslaughter and misdemeanor possession of a weapon.  The trial judge's instruction concerning intent began with the following statement:  \"I shall now define intent for you.  A person is presumed to intend the natural consequence of his act.\"  This statement is substantively identical to the instruction in <i>Sandstrom</i> which we held improper because \"a reasonable juror could have given the presumption conclusive or persuasion-shifting effect.\"  442 U.S., at 519, 99 S.Ct., at 2456-57.  See <i>id.,</i> at 513, 99 S.Ct., at 2453-54.

Conspicuously absent from the lower court's opinion is the conclusion that any of these additional statements were rhetorically inconsistent with the impermissible mandatory presumption language.  The reason is clear:  the additional instructions reasonably could have been understood by the jury in a manner entirely consistent with the improper mandatory presumption.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presence of some arguably permissive-presumption language in the judge's charge on intent merely created the \"possibility that some jurors may have interpreted the challenged instruction as permissive.\"  <i>Sandstrom, supra,</i> at 519, 99 S.Ct., at 2456.

At Chasson's trial for first degree murder, the state trial court instructed the jury that \"[w]hen one does an unlawful act he is by law presumed to have intended to do it and to have intended its ordinary and natural consequences. . . .\"  This instruction is substantively identical to the instruction found impermissible in <i>Sandstrom.</i>  In this case the trial judge also charged with respect to \"deliberate premeditation\" that the jury must find \"the prior formation of the purpose to kill.\"  The District Court denied Chasson's writ of habeas corpus, and the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed.  The Court of Appeals held that <i>Sandstrom</i> was not violated because, in light of the charge on premeditation, the improper \" 'instruction by itself [did not] so infect[ ] the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process,' <i>Cupp v.

Even if the jury interpreted the latter portion of the instruction as describing only a permissive presumption it would not be rhetorically inconsistent with the earlier defective instructions.  See 534 F.Supp. 980, 991-993 (SDNY 1982).
