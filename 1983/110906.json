The District Court may well be correct, but I am not prepared to create a precedent in this Court by summarily affirming its decision.

It also contends that AT &amp; T should not have been permitted to sell telephones through its Phone Center Stores because competitors, especially local telephone companies, will not be able to compete effectively.  In No. 82-992, by contrast, an association of telephone manufacturers, does not object to permitting AT &amp; T to sell telephones, but insists that local telephone companies should not be permitted to do so.

Senator Tunney spoke of several \"blatantly inequitable and improper antitrust settlements.\"  119 Cong.Rec. 24598 (1973).  The Act appears to have been intended to prevent the Department of Justice from settling civil antitrust cases on terms less favorable than Congress thought it should obtain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with this paucity of guidance, the District Court undertook to \"defin[e] the public interest in accordance with the antitrust laws.\"  F.Supp., at 149.

If the decree meets the requirements for      an antitrust remedy&#8212;that is, if it effectively opens the      relevant markets to competition and prevents the recurrence      of anticompetitive activity, all without imposing undue and      unnecessary burdens upon other aspects of the public interest      it will be approved.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 153.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not clear to me that this standard, or any other standard the District Court could have devised, admits of resolution by a court exercising the judicial power established by Article III of the Constitution.  The Act applies only when a case has been settled.  Thus, by definition, there has been no judicial finding of relevant markets, closed or otherwise, to be opened or of anticompetitive activity to be prevented.  The District Court seems to have assumed first that there was an antitrust violation and second that it knew the scope and effects of the violation. But the parties have settled the case and thereby avoided the necessity for such findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if this problem could be put aside, the case remains problematic at best.  Representative Hutchinson, who was a member of the House Committee that considered the Act, stated on the House floor that it \"imposes on the courts what is essentially nonjudicial           function.  In short, the courts will have to decide           whether the Department of Justice has exercised its           prosecutorial discretion to settle antitrust cases as           well as it should. . . .  In my opinion, such a process           is foreign to the judicial function.\"  120 Cong.Rec.           36340 (1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an addendum to the committee report, Rep.

The question for the court will be whether the      Department of Justice has exercised its prosecutorial      discretion well or, perhaps, as well as possible.  The      question will <i>not</i> be whether the Department has violated some      legal standard.  For none is established by this legislation.      Rather, the court is given a plenary and unqualified      authority to re-decide an executive decision.\"  H.R.Rep. No.      93-1463, p. 21 (1974) (Additional Views of Mr. Hutchinson)      (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe this point is well taken.  The question assigned to the district courts by the Act is a classic example of a question committed to the Executive.  \"The province of the court is, solely, to decide on the rights of individuals, not to inquire how the executive, or executive officers, perform duties in which they have a discretion.\"  <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 170, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803).  In <i>Baker v. Carr,</i> 369 U.S. 186, 217, 82 S.Ct. 691, 710, 7 L.Ed.2d 663, the Court listed six alternative ways of identifying a political question that is beyond the competence of the judiciary.  Three of these apply to this case:  \"a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department;  or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for discovering it;  or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question whether to prosecute a lawsuit is a question of the execution of the laws, which is committed to the executive by Article II.  There is no standard by which the benefits to the public from a \"better\" settlement of a lawsuit than the Justice Department has negotiated can be balanced against the risk of an adverse decision, the need for a speedy resolution of the case, the benefits obtained in the settlement, and the availability of the Department's resources for other cases.  How is a court to decide whether a better settlement in a case involving one industry is more important to the public than the benefits that might be gained by immediately working on an antitrust problem in another industry?  Finally, the decision requires an evaluation of an initial policy decision, whether the benefits that might be obtained in a lawsuit are worth the risks and costs, that is clearly for nonjudicial discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the language of the Court in <i>Green v. Frazier,</i> 253 U.S. 233, 240, 40 S.Ct. 499, 501, 64 L.Ed. 878 (1920), seems fully applicable here:  \"Questions of policy are not submitted to judicial determination, and the courts have no general authority of supervision over the exercise of discretion which under our system is reposed in the people or other branches of government.\" Even though Congress may be statute impose such a duty on the federal courts, they may not perform it.  <i>United States v. Muskrat,</i> 219 U.S. 346, 31 S.Ct. 250, 55 L.Ed. 246 (1911).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because I am concerned about the implications of the Court's decision in Nos. 82-952 and 82-1001, and because it is not clear to me whether the determination sought to be reviewed in Nos. 82-953 and 82-992 is within the judicial power, I would set these appeals for oral argument and postpone the further consideration of the question of jurisdiction to the hearing of the case on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    ", "html_lawbox": "", "html_with_citations": "<p class=\"case_cite\">75 L.Ed.2d 472</p>\n    <p class=\"case_cite\">103 S.Ct. 1240</p>\n    <p class=\"case_cite\"><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1001</span></span></p>\n    <p class=\"parties\">MARYLAND, et al., Appellants,<br>v.<br>UNITED STATES et al.

The      question will <i>not</i> be whether the Department has violated some      legal standard.  For none is established by this legislation.      Rather, the court is given a plenary and unqualified      authority to re-decide an executive decision.\"  H.R.Rep. No.      93-1463, p. 21 (1974) (Additional Views of Mr. Hutchinson)      (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe this point is well taken.  The question assigned to the district courts by the Act is a classic example of a question committed to the Executive.  \"The province of the court is, solely, to decide on the rights of individuals, not to inquire how the executive, or executive officers, perform duties in which they have a discretion.\"  <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 170, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803).  In <i>Baker v. Carr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106366\"><a href=\"/opinion/106366/baker-v-carr/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span>, 217, 82 S.Ct. 691, 710, 7 L.Ed.2d 663, the Court listed six alternative ways of identifying a political question that is beyond the competence of the judiciary.  Three of these apply to this case:  \"a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department;  or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for discovering it;  or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question whether to prosecute a lawsuit is a question of the execution of the laws, which is committed to the executive by Article II.  There is no standard by which the benefits to the public from a \"better\" settlement of a lawsuit than the Justice Department has negotiated can be balanced against the risk of an adverse decision, the need for a speedy resolution of the case, the benefits obtained in the settlement, and the availability of the Department's resources for other cases.  How is a court to decide whether a better settlement in a case involving one industry is more important to the public than the benefits that might be gained by immediately working on an antitrust problem in another industry?  Finally, the decision requires an evaluation of an initial policy decision, whether the benefits that might be obtained in a lawsuit are worth the risks and costs, that is clearly for nonjudicial discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the language of the Court in <i>Green v. Frazier,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99608\"><a href=\"/opinion/99608/green-v-frazier/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span>, 240, 40 S.Ct. 499, 501, 64 L.Ed. 878 (1920), seems fully applicable here:  \"Questions of policy are not submitted to judicial determination, and the courts have no general authority of supervision over the exercise of discretion which under our system is reposed in the people or other branches of government.\" Even though Congress may be statute impose such a duty on the federal courts, they may not perform it.  <i>United States v.
