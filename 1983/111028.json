That holding conflicts with the decision in <i>United States v.

The Tenth Circuit found they were not because their functions were not necessary, but merely helpful.  I do not find that case distinguishable from the present one.  The difference between conviction and acquittal should not rest on whether an illegal gambling establishment existed in isolation or was concealed within another, legal, establishment.  If a waitress who functions solely as a waitress in an illegal gambling establishment could not be convicted under &#167; 1955, as the Tenth Circuit has held, then a waiter/janitor who functions solely as a waiter/janitor should not be convicted either.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because a case involving a conflict among the courts of appeals concerning the standard to be applied in determining criminal liability involves either the unjust conviction of an innocent person or the frustration of congressional intent to criminalize specific conduct, it necessarily presents an important question.
