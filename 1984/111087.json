After a jury found he had killed with malice, respondent was sentenced to 99 years imprisonment.  The conviction was upheld on direct appeal.  See <i>Vela v. State,</i> 516 S.W.2d 176 (Tex.Cr.App.1974).  Respondent then filed consecutive petitions for writs of habeas corpus in state and federal courts, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.  In both petitions, respondent raised the same three allegations of error as support for his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.  Both the state courts and the Federal District Court found that the three errors, when considered in the context of the entire record, were not cumulatively of such magnitude to render counsel's conduct of the trial as a whole constitutionally infirm.  The courts also held that respondent was not prejudiced from any inadequacy that could be found.  See <i>Ex Parte Vela,</i> Application No. 9209, at 20-22 (June 4, 1980) (state court);  Supp.App. E1-E8 (Federal District Court).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondent appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, presenting the same three allegations of counsel error and, for the first time, raising other allegations of error as well.  The Court of Appeals decided that the exhaustion requirement of 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2254(b), (c) did not prevent it from considering the additional instances of alleged ineffective assistance.  Though these additional instances of ineffectiveness had not specifically been brought to the attention of the state courts, the Court of Appeals noted that the alleged errors were contained in the trial record and that the state courts purportedly had reviewed the entire record in finding counsel's performance adequate in the \"totality of the circumstances.\" Thus, the Court of Appeals concluded that \"the alleged 'new facts' [were] not new at all,\" and that respondent had exhausted all available state remedies.  App. to Pet. for Cert. B15-B16.  On the merits, it found that respondent had received ineffective assistance at trial because his counsel had committed the three \"central errors\" raised in the state court petition and \"several other serious errors as well.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at B18-B28.  The Court concluded that respondent had suffered prejudice of sufficient magnitude to warrant granting a writ of habeas corpus.  <i>Id.,</i> at B28-B30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the correctness of the Court of Appeals' \"ineffective assistance\" determination, see Supp.App. E2-E8, this petition raises an issue of considerable importance to the administration of federal habeas corpus.

Connor,</i> 404 U.S. 270, 275, 92 S.Ct. 509, 512, 30 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971).  It \"serves to minimize friction between our federal and state systems of justice by allowing the State an initial opportunity to pass upon and correct alleged violations of prisoners' federal rights.\"  <i>Duckworth v. Serrano,</i> 454 U.S. 1, 2, 102 S.Ct. 18, 19, 70 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981) (<i>per curiam</i> ).  For the State to have that opportunity, \"the federal claim must be fairly presented to the state courts.\"  <i>Picard v. Connor, supra,</i> 404 U.S., at 275, 92 S.Ct., at 512.  A federal habeas petitioner making a claim critically dependent on specific allegations of error never brought to the state court's attention has not \"fairly presented\" that claim.  See <i>Rose v. Lundy,</i> 455 U.S. 509, 526-527, 531-532, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 1207-1208, 1210, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982) (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in the judgment) (interrelated claims requiring exhaustion are those necessitating examination of the entire record).

But that is obviously beside the point.  The exhaustion rule requires that the habeas petitioner do more than make available to the state courts all facts necessary to support a claim.  It requires the petitioner to identify for the state courts' attention the constitutional claim alleged to be inherent in those facts.  See <i>Picard v. Connor, supra,</i> 404 U.S., at 277, 92 S.Ct., at 513.  Much as with our rules on direct review, the exhaustion rule requires that the habeas petitioner, and not the state court judges, bear the burden of severing the bad from the good and of raising those errors supportive of an alleged constitutional claim.  See <i>Webb v. Webb,</i> 451 U.S. 493, 499-501, 101 S.Ct. 1889, 1893-1894, 68 L.Ed.2d 392 (1981) (principle of comity behind \"properly-raised-federal-question\" doctrine similar to principle behind exhaustion doctrine).

The exhaustion rule requires that the substance of a federal habeas corpus claim first be presented to the state courts, <i>Picard v. Connor, supra,</i> 404 U.S., at 278, 92 S.Ct., at 513, and the substance of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is identified by the list of alleged errors committed by counsel.  See <i>Domaingue v. Butterworth,</i> 641 F.2d 8, 12-13 (CA1 1981).  Unless the state courts have been pointed to a particular error of counsel, a claim based on that error is unexhausted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal rules require habeas petitioners to \"to set forth in summary form the facts supporting each of the grounds thus specified.\"  Advisory Committee's Note to Habeas Corpus Rule 2(c), 28 U.S.C. foll. &#167; 2254.
