In their complaint, petitioners alleged that two minutes after the car swerved off the road and burst into flames, one of the respondents, a police officer, arrived on the scene and began directing traffic around the car.  Firemen were summoned, and the fire was extinguished;  yet no efforts were made to remove decedents from the car, nor was an ambulance called until some 45 minutes after the accident occurred.

While the Court of Appeals in the present case determined that the state's failure to provide adequate rescue services was not actionable under &#167; 1983, other courts have permitted relief under that section when a foster parent's abuse of his foster child was permitted by the state agency's failure adequately to monitor the foster care environment, <i>Doe v.
