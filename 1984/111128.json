I take the Court's citation of <i>Pullman Standard v. Swint,</i> 456 U.S. 273, 293, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 1792, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982), to mean that it believes that the Court of Appeals found the facts on these two points, rather than permitting the District Court to do so in the first instance.  If that is the basis for the Court's disposition, it is mistaken.  The District Court clearly found that even when only post-1972 evidence was considered, respondents had demonstrated the existence of unlawful discrimination both through statistical<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and nonstatistical<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> evidence.  Moreover, the District Court found that even if the actions of the Civil Service Commission were nonactionable, the evidence concerning the actions of NARDAC alone still demonstrated the existence of unlawful discrimination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Most important, the District Court explicitly noted that respondents' statistics demonstrated that during the post-Act period female employees were paid consistently less than male employees even when the factors used by the Civil Service Commission to make placement decisions were considered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  This is simply not a case in which a court of appeals has improperly found the facts in the first instance. Thus, we have a finding of fact that has been reviewed and upheld by a Court of Appeals.  Our customary practice is to accord such a finding the greatest respect even in cases that have been fully briefed and argued in this Court.  See, <i>e.g., Rogers v. Lodge,</i> 458 U.S. 613, 623, 102 S.Ct. 3272, 3278-79, 73 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1982); <i>Neil v. Biggers,</i> 409 U.S. 188, 193, n. 3, 93 S.Ct. 375, 379, n. 3, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972);  <i>Berenyi v. Immigration Director,</i> 385 U.S. 630, 635, 87 S.Ct. 666, 670, 17 L.Ed.2d 656 (1967).  To set such a finding aside without even looking at the record, or at any of the evidence on which it is based, strikes me as a gross violation of the procedures that should constrain our work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two other observations concerning the Court's action today are appropriate.  First, the strong interest in bringing protracted litigation to a conclusion seems to have no impact on this Court.  See <i>Pennhurst State School &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman,</i> 465 U.S. ----, ----, 104 S.Ct. 900, 922, 78 L.Ed.2d ---- (1984) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).  The Court's action today encourages the kind of litigating strategy that gives the party with the greater resources a significant advantage unrelated to the merits of the case.  The kind of casual command to begin anew that is reflected in today's order tends to undermine the ability of trial judges to exercise firm control over the progress of litigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Moreover, this action can only encourage parties to file more and more petitions asking this Court to engage in factual disputes that we are not equipped to resolve effectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, this case illustrates the dangers inherent in an excessive reliance on summary dispositions.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals had the benefit of extensive briefing, a complete record, and several months' of consideration of this case.  Today, in summary fashion, we second guess their considered judgment as to the probative value of respondents' evidence after the most truncated of presentations.  It is, of course, entirely possible that the Court has issued the right command as it gallops by this immense record.  But if that be true, the Court is just lucky.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At least respondents have so represented;  I have not examined the record myself because it has not been filed in this Court.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Civil Service Commission, which later became the Office of Personnel Management.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The Court of Appeals also emphasized that nonstatistical evidence supported the District Court's findings.

In fact, the interplay among job description, assignment to positions, distribution of duties, and classification standards leaves ample room for flexible treatment and hence for variation and discrimination.</p>\n        <p>\"Furthermore, even if all authority for improper initial grade placement were assumed to rest with the Civil Service Commission, the resulting disparities in grade level remaining over several years could still be properly attributable to NARDAC. In such a case, either NARDAC failed to promote equitably individuals who were discriminated against at hiring (which would constitute direct discrimination by NARDAC) or operation of the Whitten Amendment regulations locked in the effect of earlier discrimination.

To accomplish this analysis, the expert witness specified for regression a linear model which included dummy variables for level of education, years of NARDAC service, years of other government employment service, years of potential nongovernment experience between date of receipt of last educational degree and date of entry in federal service, and sex. The dependent variable was sex.</p>\n        <p>\"When prior experience and education were thus taken into account, female employees still received substantially lower salaries than men, the yearly differential attributable to sex ranging from $2,200 to $3,500.  Since there was never any suggestion by the government that factors other than education or experience could legitimately account for the differences, the Court would clearly have been justified, absent some explanation, to draw the conclusion that equally qualified female employees of NARDAC consistently received lower salaries on the average than male employees and, accordingly, that they had been the victims of improper discrimination.\"  517 F.Supp., at 878-879 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Petitioners' conduct of this litigation has hardly been a model for future cases.

Therefore, we agree that the appellants' evidence was      incapable of raising a genuine issue concerning the validity      of the inference of discrimination raised by the plaintiffs'      statistical evidence.

I take the Court's citation of <i>Pullman Standard v. Swint,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110698\"><a href=\"/opinion/110698/pullman-standard-v-swint/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span>, 293, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 1792, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982), to mean that it believes that the Court of Appeals found the facts on these two points, rather than permitting the District Court to do so in the first instance.  If that is the basis for the Court's disposition, it is mistaken.  The District Court clearly found that even when only post-1972 evidence was considered, respondents had demonstrated the existence of unlawful discrimination both through statistical<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and nonstatistical<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> evidence.  Moreover, the District Court found that even if the actions of the Civil Service Commission were nonactionable, the evidence concerning the actions of NARDAC alone still demonstrated the existence of unlawful discrimination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Most important, the District Court explicitly noted that respondents' statistics demonstrated that during the post-Act period female employees were paid consistently less than male employees even when the factors used by the Civil Service Commission to make placement decisions were considered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  This is simply not a case in which a court of appeals has improperly found the facts in the first instance. Thus, we have a finding of fact that has been reviewed and upheld by a Court of Appeals.  Our customary practice is to accord such a finding the greatest respect even in cases that have been fully briefed and argued in this Court.  See, <i>e.g., Rogers v. Lodge,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110790\"><a href=\"/opinion/110790/rogers-v-lodge/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">613</span></a></span>, 623, 102 S.Ct. 3272, 3278-79, 73 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1982); <i>Neil v.

To set such a finding aside without even looking at the record, or at any of the evidence on which it is based, strikes me as a gross violation of the procedures that should constrain our work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two other observations concerning the Court's action today are appropriate.  First, the strong interest in bringing protracted litigation to a conclusion seems to have no impact on this Court.  See <i>Pennhurst State School &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman,</i> 465 U.S. ----, ----, 104 S.Ct. 900, 922, 78 L.Ed.2d ---- (1984) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).  The Court's action today encourages the kind of litigating strategy that gives the party with the greater resources a significant advantage unrelated to the merits of the case.  The kind of casual command to begin anew that is reflected in today's order tends to undermine the ability of trial judges to exercise firm control over the progress of litigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Moreover, this action can only encourage parties to file more and more petitions asking this Court to engage in factual disputes that we are not equipped to resolve effectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, this case illustrates the dangers inherent in an excessive reliance on summary dispositions.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals had the benefit of extensive briefing, a complete record, and several months' of consideration of this case.  Today, in summary fashion, we second guess their considered judgment as to the probative value of respondents' evidence after the most truncated of presentations.  It is, of course, entirely possible that the Court has issued the right command as it gallops by this immense record.  But if that be true, the Court is just lucky.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At least respondents have so represented;  I have not examined the record myself because it has not been filed in this Court.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Civil Service Commission, which later became the Office of Personnel Management.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The Court of Appeals also emphasized that nonstatistical evidence supported the District Court's findings.  It stated: \"The District Court also found persuasive the testimony of a number of class members.  Although we do not specifically discuss this testimony, the District Court properly considered the statistical and nonstatistical evidence on a cumulative basis in assessing the strength of the plaintiffs' prima facie case.   <i>EEOC v.

However, whatever may have been the formalistic Civil Service classification system, defendants failed to demonstrate that NARDAC had no influence on initial grade placement decisions.  In fact, the interplay among job description, assignment to positions, distribution of duties, and classification standards leaves ample room for flexible treatment and hence for variation and discrimination.</p>\n        <p>\"Furthermore, even if all authority for improper initial grade placement were assumed to rest with the Civil Service Commission, the resulting disparities in grade level remaining over several years could still be properly attributable to NARDAC. In such a case, either NARDAC failed to promote equitably individuals who were discriminated against at hiring (which would constitute direct discrimination by NARDAC) or operation of the Whitten Amendment regulations locked in the effect of earlier discrimination.  In either event, the assumption implicit in defendants' statistics that discrimination in initial placement is irrelevant to their case is incorrect and undermines their analysis.\"  517 F.Supp., at 885 (citations omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> \"Plaintiffs' expert began his analysis with the undisputed fact that the average salary for female employees at NARDAC has throughout the relevant period been considerably lower than that of males.

The salary differentials throughout this period reflect the relative concentration of women in NARDAC in the lower civil service grade levels . . . .</p>\n        <p>\"With these salary differentials clearly established, plaintiffs' expert sought to determine next, on a year-by-year basis between 1972 and 1979, whether the disparity could be accounted for by differences between men and women in education and experience, or whether it was more likely to be attributable to sex discrimination.  To accomplish this analysis, the expert witness specified for regression a linear model which included dummy variables for level of education, years of NARDAC service, years of other government employment service, years of potential nongovernment experience between date of receipt of last educational degree and date of entry in federal service, and sex. The dependent variable was sex.</p>\n        <p>\"When prior experience and education were thus taken into account, female employees still received substantially lower salaries than men, the yearly differential attributable to sex ranging from $2,200 to $3,500.  Since there was never any suggestion by the government that factors other than education or experience could legitimately account for the differences, the Court would clearly have been justified, absent some explanation, to draw the conclusion that equally qualified female employees of NARDAC consistently received lower salaries on the average than male employees and, accordingly, that they had been the victims of improper discrimination.\"  517 F.Supp., at 878-879 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Petitioners' conduct of this litigation has hardly been a model for future cases.

The Court of Appeals agreed with Judge Greene that petitioners should have adduced this evidence during trial.  Indeed, it found petitioners' conduct indefensible:  \"We would add that we find it extremely troublesome in light of the long and complex history of this litigation and in light of Judge Greene's patient and thoughtful treatment of the case&#8212;that the appellants would even propose that the trial court reopen and retry the matter.  In the context of this case setting, such an adversarial tactic is irresponsible, insensitive to the extraordinary burdens faced by district courts already overloaded with heavy dockets, and wasteful of precious resources of litigants and the judiciary.
