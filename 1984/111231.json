In Enmund this Court recognized \"[s]ociety's rejection of the death penalty for accomplice liability in felony murders,\" id., at 794, 102 S.Ct., at 3375, by holding that the Eighth Amendment as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits States from imposing the death penalty in the absence of a finding that a participant in a felony murder either killed, or attempted to kill, or intended that a killing take place or that lethal force be employed. Id., at 797, 102 S.Ct., at 3376. Here, the jury made no explicit finding that petitioner engaged in the conduct or possessed the intent which, under Enmund, is required for a valid death sentence.

The \"remedy\" the Illinois Supreme Court created to address the ambiguity of the jury's verdict&#8212;setting itself up as a finder of fact on the issue of intent&#8212;contravenes a related tenet of this Court's death penalty jurisprudence: that the uniquely harsh consequence entailed by capital punishment demands the greatest possible exactitude in the factfinding process. See, e.g., Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625, 100 S.Ct. 2382, 65 L.Ed.2d 392 (1980); Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 420, 100 S.Ct. 1759, 64 L.Ed.2d 398 (1980). The ruling of the Illinois Supreme Court mocks this standard by attempting to derive from a cold paper record a subtle factual determination best left in the hands of juries or trial courts that have had the opportunity to view witness demeanor and other delicate nuances that cannot be captured by written transcripts. Confronted with \"a level of uncertainty [in] the factfinding process that cannot be tolerated in a capital case,\" Beck v.
