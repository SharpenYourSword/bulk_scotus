First, however plausible the rationale of <i>Swain</i> may have seemed two decades ago, the justification for shielding peremptory challenges from equal protection scrutiny has not withstood the test of time.  <i>Swain</i> thus should be reconsidered for equal protection as well as Sixth Amendment reasons.  Second, the admirable intent of three of my colleagues in acknowledging the import of the issue but deferring our review \"to allow the various States to serve as laboratories in which the issue receives further study,\" see <i>McCray, supra,</i> 461 U.S., at 963, 103 S.Ct., at 2439 (opinion of STEVENS, J., joined by BLACKMUN and POWELL, JJ.), has spawned confusion not clarification in the courts below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* <i>Swain</i> is an anomaly, a departure from two fundamental principles of constitutional law.  The first is the basic equal protection notion that government officials cannot exclude persons from juries solely because of their race.  \"It is well known that prejudices often exist against particular classes in the community, which sway the judgment of jurors, and which, therefore, operate in some cases to deny to persons of those classes the full enjoyment of that protection [a jury of peers] which others enjoy.\"   <i>Strauder v. West Virginia,</i> 100 U.S. 303, 308-309, 25 L.Ed. 664 (1880).  The second is the basic notion inherent in the \"American tradition of trial by jury\" that \"[j]ury competence is an individual rather than a group or class matter. That fact lies at the very heart of the jury system.  To disregard it is to open the door to class distinctions and discrimination which are abhorrent to the democratic ideals of trial by jury.\" <i>Thiel v. Southern Pacific Co.,</i> 328 U.S. 217, 220, 66 S.Ct. 984, 985, 90 L.Ed. 1181 (1946).  Notwithstanding the force of these principles, five Members of the Court in <i>Swain</i> (of whom I was one) held that the prosecution's right to use peremptory challenges in any particular case involving a Negro defendant had to remain free of equal protection scrutiny.  After acknowledging the impressive pedigree of the peremptory challenge, we held that such challenges are frequently</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"exercised on grounds thought irrelevant to legal proceedings      or official action, namely, the race, religion, nationality,      occupation or affiliations of people summoned for jury duty.      For the question a prosecutor or defense counsel must decide      is not whether a juror of a particular race or nationality is      in fact partial, but whether one from a different group is      less likely to be. . . .  Hence veniremen are not always      judged solely as individuals for the purpose of exercising      peremptory challenges.  Rather they are challenged in light      of the limited knowledge counsel has of them, which may      include their group affiliations. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"With these considerations in mind, we cannot hold that      the striking of Negroes in a particular case is a denial of      equal protection of the laws.\"  380 U.S., at 220-221, 85      S.Ct., at 835-836 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the hindsight that two decades affords, it is apparent to me that <i>Swain</i> &#167; reasoning was misconceived.  Stripped of its historical embellishments, <i>Swain</i> holds that the State may presume in exercising peremptory challenges that only white jurors will be sufficiently impartial to try a Negro defendant fairly.  In other words, <i>Swain</i> authorizes the presumption that a Negro juror will be partial to a Negro defendant simply because both belong to the same race.  Implicit in such a presumption is profound disrespect for the ability of individual Negro jurors to judge impartially. It is the race of the juror, and nothing more, that gives rise to the doubt in the mind of the prosecutor.  Whatever the justification for permitting the idiosyncratic use of peremptory challenges in the run of cases, that justification ought not extend to permit the government to make use of an unfounded racial presumption that disparages Negroes in this way.  Cf. <i>Palmore v. Sidoti,</i> 466 U.S. 429, 432, 104 S.Ct. 1879, 1882, 80 L.Ed.2d 421 (1984) (\"Classifying persons according to their race is more likely to reflect racial prejudice than legitimate public concerns;  the race, not the person, dictates the category\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>McCray v.

Three of these five went on to suggest a preference for deferring review to permit experimentation in the state courts, presumably in a state constitutional law context, regarding how allegations of race-based use of peremptory challenges should be raised and considered.  The decision to defer review has not produced the desired <i>state-law</i> experimentation in the state courts.  See <i>Gilliard v.

Instead it has thrown the status of <i>Swain</i> as a matter of federal constitutional law into considerable doubt in the lower courts.
