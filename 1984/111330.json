In this second petition for federal habeas relief, Stephens contends, <i>inter alia</i>, that he received the death penalty pursuant to a pattern and practice of racial discrimination in the administration of Georgia's capital sentencing system, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Specifically, he points to recently available statistical studies allegedly demonstrating a persistent and pronounced disparity in capital sentencing in Georgia based on the race of the defendant and the race of the victim.  Stephens unsuccessfully has sought an evidentiary hearing to prove the accuracy and materiality of these data.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The courts below acknowledged that the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has recently held in several cases that the <i>identical</i> evidence proffered by Stephens is sufficient to require an evidentiary hearing under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254.  The Eleventh Circuit in fact is currently considering en banc the very issues presented in Stephens' petition&#8212;whether the newly developed studies are reliable, and whether they are material to the constitutionality of Georgia's capital sentencing scheme. Stephens' petition has not been held pending the outcome of this en banc consideration, however, because the courts below have concluded that Stephens has engaged in abuse of the writ.  Specifically, they have determined that (1) although the new studies constitute \"newly discovered evidence\" for purposes of permitting relief on a first petition for habeas review, the identical studies do not constitute \"newly discovered evidence\" for purposes of securing relief on a second petition;  and (2) Stephens in fact received an \"evidentiary hearing\" at which he failed to make an adequate \"proffer\" of the new studies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just last December, this Court stayed Stephens' execution pending the Eleventh Circuit's en banc resolution of the discrimination issue \"or until further order of this Court.\"  464 U.S. 1027, 1028, 104 S.Ct. 562, 78 L.Ed.2d 370 (1983).  In today's \"further order,\" the Court inexplicably reverses course and decides that the execution may proceed notwithstanding the continued pendency of the discrimination issue before the Eleventh Circuit.  To the extent this reversal purports to rest on deference to the lower courts' abuse-of-the-writ findings, I would respectfully submit that those findings fly in the face of the Fifth Amendment, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254 and its attendant Rules, and well-settled precedent.  Specifically, the record before us makes clear that (1) the proffered statistical studies are \"newly discovered evidence\" within the meaning of &#167; 2254;  and (2) Stephens did not receive the full and fair opportunity to introduce these studies to which he was entitled by law.  At the very least, this case presents substantial questions concerning the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine that will recur with ever-increasing frequency.  I therefore dissent from the Court's denial of certiorari and its vacation of the stay of execution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Stephens filed his second petition for habeas relief on November 14, 1983, two days before his scheduled execution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Anticipating that the State of Georgia would plead abuse of the writ pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254 Rule 9(b), Stephens explained that his discrimination claim was \"based on factual evidence which Petitioner, as an indigent, did not have the independent means to develop and present.\"  1 Record 17.

A two-week evidentiary hearing to consider      this extensive new social scientific evidence began on August      8, 1983 in <i>McCleskey v.

Oral argument commenced at 3:30 that afternoon.  The court announced that it had convened the session to hear argument whether \"a successor petition should be entertained by this Court\" and whether the execution should be stayed to permit further proceedings.  2 Record 3, 76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stephens' counsel described the nature and findings of the statistical studies that recently had been found sufficient to trigger an evidentiary hearing in <i>McCleskey,</i> and indicated that those studies would form the proffer if a hearing were granted in the instant case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The court responded that \"I am familiar with the circumstances\" of the studies and that \"[t]his has been discussed in other cases with me.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 33.  When the court expressed skepticism that the studies could be characterized as \"new\" evidence,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Stephens' counsel emphasized that the studies had become available only after Stephens' first habeas petition had been dismissed, that as an indigent Stephens could not have afforded the prohibitive cost of underwriting independent studies, and that because the studies could not reasonably have been produced in previous proceedings, they were properly characterized as \"new\" evidence within the meaning of Habeas Corpus Rule 9(b). <i>Id.,</i> at 31-32.  When the court asked for more specific details concerning the studies, counsel responded that the methodology was \"fairly complicated\" and suggested that, if the court wished to review the data, counsel not later than the next morning could deliver the several file drawers of evidence adduced at the <i>McCleskey</i> hearing. <i>Id.,</i> at 42.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much of the remaining argument was devoted to a discussion whether the court should hold an evidentiary hearing to probe the issues in further detail.

The court also specifically denied Stephens' requests for an evidentiary hearing.  <i>Ibid.</i>  With respect to the merits of the discrimination claims, the court stated: \"[I]t is the opinion of this trial judge that      petitioner's excuse is insufficient to justify a      consideration of them in this successive petition.

Nothing      prevented the compilation of this information prior to this      late date.

A panel of that court heard oral argument on December 7 and, on December 9, denied both of Stephens' applications.  721 F.2d 1300 (1983).  The panel did not address the District Court's conclusion that the statistical evidence was not newly discovered within the meaning of &#167; 2254.  Rather, it seized upon note 2 of the District Court's opinion to conclude that Stephens in fact had received the required evidentiary hearing and had failed to make a proper \"proffer\" of the statistical evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stephens filed a petition for rehearing and a suggestion for rehearing en banc on December 10, which was denied on December 13 in a 6-6 vote.  722 F.2d 627 (1983).  Five of the dissenting judges argued that (1) the statistical data were \"newly discovered\" within the meaning of &#167; 2254;  (2) Stephens had made an adequate proffer for purposes of the November 15 oral argument; and (3) the November 15 oral argument had not been an \"evidentiary hearing.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 628-629.  Judge Kravitch, who had joined in the earlier panel decision, now filed a separate dissenting opinion emphasizing that there was \"a serious question concerning petitioner's opportunity to proffer evidence at the district court hearing, a factor crucial to the panel's holding.\"   <i>Id.,</i> at 629.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stephens filed an emergency application for a stay of execution with Justice POWELL, which was referred by him to the entire Court and granted late in the evening of December 13.  The Court issued an order staying Stephens' execution \"pending the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in <i>Spencer v.

The Court subsequently denied the State's motion to vacate the stay of execution.  465 U.S. 1016, 104 S.Ct. 1263, 79 L.Ed.2d 671 (1984).  Today the Court reverses itself and decides, without explanation, that Stephens can be put to death notwithstanding the continued pendency of <i>Spencer</i> and the other cases consolidated for resolution by the Eleventh Circuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether Stephens' proffered statistical evidence is sound or whether, if sound, it sufficiently demonstrates an invidious application of Georgia's capital sentencing scheme.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> At the time Stephens filed his second petition the law in the Eleventh Circuit was that the <i>identical</i> evidence was sufficient to trigger an evidentiary hearing, and the Eleventh Circuit en banc has now consolidated three cases to resolve issues concerning the accuracy and materiality of this evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The principled approach would be to stay Stephens' execution pending the outcome of these consolidated cases;  that is what the Court initially ordered last December.  464 U.S. 1027, 104 S.Ct. 562, 78 L.Ed.2d 370 (1983).  Today the Court has abandoned this course, apparently on the strength of two inexplicable findings by the courts below: (a) that Stephens' proffered evidence is not \"newly discovered\"; and (b) that Stephens in fact has already received the \"evidentiary hearing\" that he has requested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only ground raised by Georgia in its abuse-of-the-writ allegation concerning Stephens's discrimination claim is that Stephens unreasonably failed to assert this claim in his prior habeas petition, in violation of Habeas Corpus Rule 9(b). Congress has instructed the courts that a \"petitioner's failure to assert a ground in a prior petition is excusable,\" and thus not an abuse of the writ, if the ground rests on \"newly discovered evidence.\" Advisory Committee's Note to Habeas Corpus Rule 9, 28 U.S.C., p. 358.  \"Newly discovered evidence\" has a well-settled meaning:  it is \"evidence which could not reasonably have been presented\" by the petitioner in the earlier proceeding.  <i>Townsend v. Sain,</i> 372 U.S. 293, 317, 83 S.Ct. 745, 759, 9 L.Ed.2d 773 (1963).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To reject Stephens' statistical evidence on the ground that \"[n]othing prevented the compilation of this information prior to this late date,\" 578 F.Supp., at 107, would eviscerate Congress' instruction that newly discovered evidence be given fair consideration.  For \"newly discovered evidence\" by definition always existed at an earlier time;  the inquiry, rather, is whether the petitioner <i>reasonably</i> either did not know about it or could not have presented it at an earlier proceeding (as would be the case, for example, with the discovery of a hidden gun or a fugitive eyewitness).   <i>Townsend v. Sain, supra.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no question in the instant case that the pertinent statistical studies did not become available until long after Stephens filed his first habeas petition in February 1979. Indeed, work on these studies had barely commenced at that time. See also <i>Spencer v. Zant,</i> 715 F.2d, at 1582 (noting that as late as May 1982 these studies were available only through oral testimony).  As the Eleventh Circuit en banc dissenters noted, at the time of Stephens' first habeas petition the then extant social science evidence had been held inadequate as a matter of law to raise a colorable claim of discrimination in Georgia's capital sentencing system.  722 F.2d, at 628, citing <i>Spinkellink v. Wainwright,</i> 578 F.2d 582 (CA5 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 976, 99 S.Ct. 1548, 59 L.Ed.2d 796 (1979);  and <i>Smith v. Balkcom,</i> 660 F.2d 573 (CA5 1981), modified, 671 F.2d 858, mandate recalled, 677 F.2d 20, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 882, 103 S.Ct. 181, 74 L.Ed.2d 148 (1982).  And no fair-minded person could suggest that indigent, uneducated, incarcerated petitioners like Stephens should be charged with inexcusable neglect for having failed themselves to perform or to underwrite sophisticated statistical sampling surveys and complex regression analyses of racial bias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, courts within the Eleventh Circuit have repeatedly held that the identical studies offered by Stephens are newly discovered evidence within the context of a first habeas petition and, therefore, that \"cause\" existed for failing to introduce them at trial.  See n. 9, <i>supra.</i>  The test for \"newly discovered evidence\" is the same whether the evidence is presented in a first habeas petition or in a successor petition.  See n. 10, <i>supra.</i> Even if some Members of this Court for some reason disagreed with the Eleventh Circuit's determination that these studies represent \"new\" evidence, the proper course would be to resolve the issue on review of the Eleventh Circuit consolidated cases.  It would be enough for present purposes to conclude that evidence characterized by the Eleventh Circuit as \"new\" for purposes of a first habeas petition must also be characterized as \"new\" for purposes of a second.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled law that, once the State pleads abuse of the writ, the petitioner is entitled to an opportunity to rebut the allegation.  <i>Sanders v. United States,</i> 373 U.S. 1, 20-21, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 1079-1080, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963);  <i>Price v. Johnston,</i> 334 U.S. 266, 292, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 1063, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948).  \"If the answer is inadequate, the court may dismiss the petition without further proceedings.\"  <i>Ibid.</i>  But unless it is \" 'conclusively show[n]' \" that the response is without merit, the petitioner must receive an <i>evidentiary</i> hearing on the abuse-of-the-writ issue. <i>Sanders v. United States, supra,</i> 373 U.S., at 20, 83 S.Ct., at 1079, citing <i>Machibroda v. United States,</i> 368 U.S. 487, 495-496 (1962) (where petitioner makes \"specific and detailed factual assertions,\" evidentiary hearing must be scheduled);  see also <i>Price v. Johnston, supra;</i>  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254 Rule 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, courts may employ means short of a full-blown evidentiary hearing to determine whether such a hearing is required.  For example, a court may call upon the petitioner to explain in writing why his successor petition is excusable. Congress has approved just such a form notice, appended to Habeas Corpus Rule 9, which admonishes the petitioner to include all the factual allegations necessary to support the response.  Similarly, the Rules encourage courts to hold oral arguments and \"prehearing conferences\" when there is doubt concerning the necessity of an evidentiary hearing.  Such arguments \" 'may limit the questions to be resolved, identify areas of agreement and dispute, and explore evidentiary problems that may be expected to arise. . . . [S]uch conferences may also disclose that a hearing is unnecessary.' \"  Advisory Committee's Note to Habeas Corpus Rule 8, 28 U.S.C., p. 356 (citation omitted).  This practice is common and uncontroversial.  But whether the petitioner's response is elicited in writing or through oral argument, the governing standard is clear:  if the response pleads facts that, if true, would entitle the petitioner to relief, an evidentiary hearing must be held to determine those facts.  <i>Sanders v. United States, supra,</i> 373 U.S., at 21-22, 83 S.Ct., at 1080.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the District Court held an oral argument the day after Stephens filed his habeas petition and the afternoon after the State had pleaded abuse of the writ.  As discussed in Part I, <i>supra,</i> the purpose of this argument was to clarify whether (1) Stephens' execution should be stayed, and (2) whether and to what extent an evidentiary hearing was necessary to resolve the underlying merits of Stephens' petition and the State's allegation of abuse.  For purposes of the oral argument, the discussion by Stephens' counsel of the discrimination claim was more than adequate to contest the State's allegation of abuse and to require an evidentiary hearing on the matter.  Counsel explained the studies' findings and how they related to the constitutionality of the impending execution;  noted that other courts had held that the studies required an evidentiary hearing;  emphasized that the studies had not been available when Stephens filed his first habeas petition, and therefore constituted \"newly discovered evidence\";  and stressed that Stephens was prepared to proceed with an evidentiary hearing on the issue at the court's earliest convenience.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> The court responded that it was fully \"familiar with the circumstances\" of the studies.  2 Record 33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Incredibly, the District Court and the Eleventh Circuit both appear to have concluded that this oral argument, unbeknownst to Stephens or his counsel, in fact constituted the \"evidentiary hearing\" Stephens and his counsel were seeking to obtain, and that counsel's failure physically to present the several file drawers of statistical data or the testimony of Stephens' three designated witnesses at that time waived any right to further consideration of the issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  With all respect, I submit this is a shockingly unprincipled basis on which to send Stephens to the electric chair.  Counsel have sworn that they were instructed by Judge Owens' law clerk <i>not</i> to bring witnesses to the oral argument, and there is nothing in this record to suggest to the contrary. Indeed, the entire tenor of the November 15 session demonstrates that it was the sort of nonevidentiary oral argument held hundreds of times every day in federal courthouses across the country. Five of the Eleventh Circuit en banc dissenters had no difficulty in concluding that \"[t]he hearing held by the district court on November 15, 1983, was not an evidentiary hearing,\" 722 F.2d, at 628, n. 3, and repeatedly so emphasized, see also <i>id.,</i> at 628, n. 1.  Judge Kravitch, who initially had joined the panel judgment, stressed in a separate dissent that, at the very least, there was \"a serious question concerning petitioner's opportunity to proffer evidence at the district court hearing.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 629.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If counsel were expected physically to proffer the evidence they had described in the petition and to appear in court with Stephens' designated expert witnesses, they should have been so informed.  They were not.  Stephens' petition for certiorari therefore raises substantial questions implicating what I had thought until today were settled and fundamental principles under the Fifth Amendment, the habeas statutes, and the Habeas Corpus Rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>First.</i>  Until today there was \"no doubt\" that the Due Process Clause requires at a minimum that adjudications affecting an individual's life, liberty, or property be preceded by (1) notice \"reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances,\" to inform the aggrieved party of the pendency and nature of the proceedings against him;  and (2) a meaningful hearing \" 'appropriate to the nature of the case.' \"  <i>Armstrong v. Manzo,</i> 380 U.S. 545, 550, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 1190, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965), quoting <i>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 339 U.S. 306, 313, 70 S.Ct. 652, 656, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950).  \"Due process of law . . . does not allow a hearing to be held . . . without giving [petitioners] timely notice, in advance of the hearing, of the specific issues that they must meet.\"  <i>In re Gault,</i> 387 U.S. 1, 33-34, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 1446-1447, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967).  Particularly where a human life hangs in the balance, I had thought this principle axiomatically required fair notice of the nature of the hearing and whether evidence must be tendered at that time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Second.</i>  The habeas statutes themselves require federal courts to follow minimum procedural safeguards in resolving petitioners' claims.  To be sure, courts may \"summarily hear and determine the facts,\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2243, and habeas petitioners should therefore expect expedited processing of their claims.  But Congress has instructed us to ensure that such expedited resolution be accomplished \"as law and justice require.\"  <i>Ibid.</i> Accordingly, the procedures surrounding an evidentiary hearing must \"allow development, for purposes of the hearing, of the facts relevant to disposition of a habeas corpus petition,\" and habeas petitioners must receive a \"<i>full</i> opportunity for presentation of the relevant facts.\"  <i>Harris v. Nelson,</i> 394 U.S. 286, 298, 89 S.Ct. 1082, 1090, 22 L.Ed.2d 281 (1969) (emphasis added).  At Congress' direction, \"it is the duty of the court to provide the necessary facilities and procedures for an adequate inquiry.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 300, 89 S.Ct., at 1091.  The ultimate question must always be whether the hearing accorded a defendant was in fact a \"fair and meaningful <i>evidentiary</i> hearing.\"  <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court is not unfamiliar with the inherent tensions between expedited resolution of habeas petitions in capital cases and the need for fundamentally fair procedures.  Just two Terms ago, for example, the Court decided in <i>Barefoot v. Estelle,</i> 463 U.S. 880, 894, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 3395, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983), that a court of appeals may expedite briefing and hearing on the merits of a capital case where the petitioner has requested a stay of execution for consideration of his claims. The Court emphasized, however, that such expedited scheduling is permissible <i>only</i> \"provided that counsel has adequate opportunity to address the merits <i>and knows that he is expected to do so.</i>\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).  In the absence of such \"appropriate notice,\" a court may not proceed to deny the stay.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would have thought that a similar conclusion must surely follow here.  Where a habeas petitioner has designated with precision the documentary evidence and witnesses he would produce at an evidentiary hearing, the court may be entitled to schedule an expedited evidentiary hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  But counsel must be given notice that he is expected to produce the exhibits and the witnesses at the hearing.  Where counsel reasonably believes that the scheduled session will consist merely of oral argument on the facial merits of the petition&#8212;the sort of preliminary argument that frequently is held in this sort of situation, see <i>supra,</i> at 1052-1053&#8212;and has received no notice suggesting to the contrary, the oral argument cannot later be characterized as an \"evidentiary hearing\" at which the petitioner unknowingly had and lost his only chance to avoid execution.  I would have thought this principle applied with even greater force where, as here, there is uncontradicted record evidence that counsel in fact were affirmatively advised <i>not</i> to bring their witnesses to the argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Third.</i>  The Court's action also flies in the face of the Habeas Corpus Rules approved by Congress.  Rule 8(c), for example, provides that an evidentiary hearing \"shall be conducted as promptly as practicable, having regard for the need of counsel for both parties for adequate time for investigation and preparation.\" The Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 8 stresses that courts are to follow those procedures necessary to ensure that counsel can \"prepare <i>adequately</i> for an evidentiary hearing.\"  28 U.S.C., p. 356 (emphasis added).  I would have thought it elementary that a necessary component of such procedures is adequate notice that counsel will be expected to produce the documentary evidence and witness testimony on which the petition rests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Habeas Corpus Rule 11 commands the federal courts to apply the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \"to the extent that they are not inconsistent with these rules.\"  The notion of fair and adequate notice permeates the Civil Rules.  Rule 12(c), for example, provides that if a court considers matters outside the pleadings in determining whether to enter judgment, the motion shall be considered as one for summary judgment \"and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion.\"  Similarly, Rule 56 has consistently been interpreted to require both (1) \"fair notice\" to the nonmovant that he is expected to present controverting evidence, so as to avoid \"unfair surprise\" in the summary resolution of the dispute;  and (2) a \"reasonable opportunity\" to present such evidence.   <i>Macklin v. Butler,</i> 553 F.2d 525, 528-529 (CA7 1977); see also <i>Plante v. Shivar,</i> 540 F.2d 1233, 1234-1235 (CA4 1976) <i>(per curiam);  Dale v. Hahn,</i> 440 F.2d 633, 638 (CA2 1971). Notwithstanding the expedited scheduling of habeas petitions in capital cases, these requirements are not \"inconsistent\" with the Habeas Rules.  Indeed, they are a basic prerequisite to ensuring that the habeas remedy is administered \"as law and justice require.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2243.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I continue to adhere to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, <i>Gregg v. Georgia,</i> 428 U.S. 153, 227, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2950, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), and would therefore grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case.  But even if I believed otherwise, I would at the very least continue the stay of execution pending the Eleventh Circuit's en banc resolution of the underlying discrimination issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stephens' petition presents questions that cut to the very heart of the Court's professed desire to ensure the fair administration of &#167; 2254, particularly where the petitioner has been condemned to death.  One need not reach the underlying merits of Stephens' discrimination claim to conclude that, on the basis of the record before us, there is at the very least a substantial question whether his fate should be governed by the outcome of the consolidated cases that are now pending before the Eleventh Circuit en banc&#8212;cases that present the <i>identical</i> issues and turn on the <i>identical</i> evidence.  Instead, Stephens will go to the electric chair on the strength of a finding that the evidentiary hearing he so fervently has sought has, in fact, already been held.  This resolution does not comport with the administration of the Great Writ \"as law and justice require.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2243. Rather, it is at best an example of result-orientation carried to its most cynical extreme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I dissent from the Court's denial of certiorari and its vacation of the stay of execution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice STEVENS, dissenting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my opinion the Court should not act on the petition for writ of certiorari, and should not vacate its stay, until after the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has decided the consolidated cases of <i>Ross v.

That action was not finally terminated until September 19, 1983, when the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit on remand from this Court considered and rejected the remaining claims in Stephens' first habeas petition. Over the next six weeks, Stephens' counsel investigated possible claims to raise in a second habeas petition and drafted the appropriate papers.  On November 1, 1983, the Superior Court of Bleckley County, Ga., set Stephens' execution date for November 16, 1983.  Stephens filed his second state habeas petition on November 7 in the Superior Court of Butts County.  One week later, on November 14, those state proceedings were concluded when the Supreme Court of Georgia denied Stephens' application for a certificate of probable cause to appeal the lower state court's denial of his petition.  Stephens filed his federal petition later that same afternoon.  The Supreme Court of Georgia stayed the execution to permit Stephens to pursue his federal action, and the Superior Court of Bleckley County thereafter reset Stephens's execution for December 14, 1983.

A panel of this court held that the evidence as proffered was material and should have been received.  In the present case the issue arose at a hearing concerning abuse of the writ but no such proffer was made by petitioner.

In this second petition for federal habeas relief, Stephens contends, <i>inter alia</i>, that he received the death penalty pursuant to a pattern and practice of racial discrimination in the administration of Georgia's capital sentencing system, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Specifically, he points to recently available statistical studies allegedly demonstrating a persistent and pronounced disparity in capital sentencing in Georgia based on the race of the defendant and the race of the victim.

The Eleventh Circuit in fact is currently considering en banc the very issues presented in Stephens' petition&#8212;whether the newly developed studies are reliable, and whether they are material to the constitutionality of Georgia's capital sentencing scheme. Stephens' petition has not been held pending the outcome of this en banc consideration, however, because the courts below have concluded that Stephens has engaged in abuse of the writ.  Specifically, they have determined that (1) although the new studies constitute \"newly discovered evidence\" for purposes of permitting relief on a first petition for habeas review, the identical studies do not constitute \"newly discovered evidence\" for purposes of securing relief on a second petition;  and (2) Stephens in fact received an \"evidentiary hearing\" at which he failed to make an adequate \"proffer\" of the new studies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just last December, this Court stayed Stephens' execution pending the Eleventh Circuit's en banc resolution of the discrimination issue \"or until further order of this Court.\"  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1027</span></span>, 1028, 104 S.Ct. 562, 78 L.Ed.2d 370 (1983).  In today's \"further order,\" the Court inexplicably reverses course and decides that the execution may proceed notwithstanding the continued pendency of the discrimination issue before the Eleventh Circuit.  To the extent this reversal purports to rest on deference to the lower courts' abuse-of-the-writ findings, I would respectfully submit that those findings fly in the face of the Fifth Amendment, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254 and its attendant Rules, and well-settled precedent.  Specifically, the record before us makes clear that (1) the proffered statistical studies are \"newly discovered evidence\" within the meaning of &#167; 2254;  and (2) Stephens did not receive the full and fair opportunity to introduce these studies to which he was entitled by law.  At the very least, this case presents substantial questions concerning the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine that will recur with ever-increasing frequency.  I therefore dissent from the Court's denial of certiorari and its vacation of the stay of execution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Stephens filed his second petition for habeas relief on November 14, 1983, two days before his scheduled execution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Anticipating that the State of Georgia would plead abuse of the writ pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254 Rule 9(b), Stephens explained that his discrimination claim was \"based on factual evidence which Petitioner, as an indigent, did not have the independent means to develop and present.\"  1 Record 17.

For \"newly discovered evidence\" by definition always existed at an earlier time;  the inquiry, rather, is whether the petitioner <i>reasonably</i> either did not know about it or could not have presented it at an earlier proceeding (as would be the case, for example, with the discovery of a hidden gun or a fugitive eyewitness).   <i>Townsend v.

Indeed, work on these studies had barely commenced at that time. See also <i>Spencer v. Zant,</i> 715 F.2d, at 1582 (noting that as late as May 1982 these studies were available only through oral testimony).  As the Eleventh Circuit en banc dissenters noted, at the time of Stephens' first habeas petition the then extant social science evidence had been held inadequate as a matter of law to raise a colorable claim of discrimination in Georgia's capital sentencing system.  722 F.2d, at 628, citing <i>Spinkellink v.

See n. 9, <i>supra.</i>  The test for \"newly discovered evidence\" is the same whether the evidence is presented in a first habeas petition or in a successor petition.  See n. 10, <i>supra.</i> Even if some Members of this Court for some reason disagreed with the Eleventh Circuit's determination that these studies represent \"new\" evidence, the proper course would be to resolve the issue on review of the Eleventh Circuit consolidated cases.  It would be enough for present purposes to conclude that evidence characterized by the Eleventh Circuit as \"new\" for purposes of a first habeas petition must also be characterized as \"new\" for purposes of a second.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled law that, once the State pleads abuse of the writ, the petitioner is entitled to an opportunity to rebut the allegation.  <i>Sanders v.

For example, a court may call upon the petitioner to explain in writing why his successor petition is excusable. Congress has approved just such a form notice, appended to Habeas Corpus Rule 9, which admonishes the petitioner to include all the factual allegations necessary to support the response.  Similarly, the Rules encourage courts to hold oral arguments and \"prehearing conferences\" when there is doubt concerning the necessity of an evidentiary hearing.  Such arguments \" 'may limit the questions to be resolved, identify areas of agreement and dispute, and explore evidentiary problems that may be expected to arise. . . . [S]uch conferences may also disclose that a hearing is unnecessary.' \"  Advisory Committee's Note to Habeas Corpus Rule 8, 28 U.S.C., p. 356 (citation omitted).  This practice is common and uncontroversial.  But whether the petitioner's response is elicited in writing or through oral argument, the governing standard is clear:  if the response pleads facts that, if true, would entitle the petitioner to relief, an evidentiary hearing must be held to determine those facts.  <i>Sanders v. United States, supra,</i> 373 U.S., at 21-22, 83 S.Ct., at 1080.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the District Court held an oral argument the day after Stephens filed his habeas petition and the afternoon after the State had pleaded abuse of the writ.  As discussed in Part I, <i>supra,</i> the purpose of this argument was to clarify whether (1) Stephens' execution should be stayed, and (2) whether and to what extent an evidentiary hearing was necessary to resolve the underlying merits of Stephens' petition and the State's allegation of abuse.  For purposes of the oral argument, the discussion by Stephens' counsel of the discrimination claim was more than adequate to contest the State's allegation of abuse and to require an evidentiary hearing on the matter.  Counsel explained the studies' findings and how they related to the constitutionality of the impending execution;  noted that other courts had held that the studies required an evidentiary hearing;  emphasized that the studies had not been available when Stephens filed his first habeas petition, and therefore constituted \"newly discovered evidence\";  and stressed that Stephens was prepared to proceed with an evidentiary hearing on the issue at the court's earliest convenience.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> The court responded that it was fully \"familiar with the circumstances\" of the studies.  2 Record 33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Incredibly, the District Court and the Eleventh Circuit both appear to have concluded that this oral argument, unbeknownst to Stephens or his counsel, in fact constituted the \"evidentiary hearing\" Stephens and his counsel were seeking to obtain, and that counsel's failure physically to present the several file drawers of statistical data or the testimony of Stephens' three designated witnesses at that time waived any right to further consideration of the issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  With all respect, I submit this is a shockingly unprincipled basis on which to send Stephens to the electric chair.  Counsel have sworn that they were instructed by Judge Owens' law clerk <i>not</i> to bring witnesses to the oral argument, and there is nothing in this record to suggest to the contrary. Indeed, the entire tenor of the November 15 session demonstrates that it was the sort of nonevidentiary oral argument held hundreds of times every day in federal courthouses across the country. Five of the Eleventh Circuit en banc dissenters had no difficulty in concluding that \"[t]he hearing held by the district court on November 15, 1983, was not an evidentiary hearing,\" 722 F.2d, at 628, n. 3, and repeatedly so emphasized, see also <i>id.,</i> at 628, n. 1.

To be sure, courts may \"summarily hear and determine the facts,\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2243, and habeas petitioners should therefore expect expedited processing of their claims.  But Congress has instructed us to ensure that such expedited resolution be accomplished \"as law and justice require.\"  <i>Ibid.</i> Accordingly, the procedures surrounding an evidentiary hearing must \"allow development, for purposes of the hearing, of the facts relevant to disposition of a habeas corpus petition,\" and habeas petitioners must receive a \"<i>full</i> opportunity for presentation of the relevant facts.\"  <i>Harris v.

At Congress' direction, \"it is the duty of the court to provide the necessary facilities and procedures for an adequate inquiry.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 300, 89 S.Ct., at 1091.  The ultimate question must always be whether the hearing accorded a defendant was in fact a \"fair and meaningful <i>evidentiary</i> hearing.\"  <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court is not unfamiliar with the inherent tensions between expedited resolution of habeas petitions in capital cases and the need for fundamentally fair procedures.  Just two Terms ago, for example, the Court decided in <i>Barefoot v. Estelle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111017\"><a href=\"/opinion/111017/barefoot-v-estelle/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">880</span></a></span>, 894, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 3395, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983), that a court of appeals may expedite briefing and hearing on the merits of a capital case where the petitioner has requested a stay of execution for consideration of his claims. The Court emphasized, however, that such expedited scheduling is permissible <i>only</i> \"provided that counsel has adequate opportunity to address the merits <i>and knows that he is expected to do so.</i>\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).  In the absence of such \"appropriate notice,\" a court may not proceed to deny the stay.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would have thought that a similar conclusion must surely follow here.  Where a habeas petitioner has designated with precision the documentary evidence and witnesses he would produce at an evidentiary hearing, the court may be entitled to schedule an expedited evidentiary hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  But counsel must be given notice that he is expected to produce the exhibits and the witnesses at the hearing.  Where counsel reasonably believes that the scheduled session will consist merely of oral argument on the facial merits of the petition&#8212;the sort of preliminary argument that frequently is held in this sort of situation, see <i>supra,</i> at 1052-1053&#8212;and has received no notice suggesting to the contrary, the oral argument cannot later be characterized as an \"evidentiary hearing\" at which the petitioner unknowingly had and lost his only chance to avoid execution.  I would have thought this principle applied with even greater force where, as here, there is uncontradicted record evidence that counsel in fact were affirmatively advised <i>not</i> to bring their witnesses to the argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Third.</i>  The Court's action also flies in the face of the Habeas Corpus Rules approved by Congress.  Rule 8(c), for example, provides that an evidentiary hearing \"shall be conducted as promptly as practicable, having regard for the need of counsel for both parties for adequate time for investigation and preparation.\" The Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 8 stresses that courts are to follow those procedures necessary to ensure that counsel can \"prepare <i>adequately</i> for an evidentiary hearing.\"  28 U.S.C., p. 356 (emphasis added).  I would have thought it elementary that a necessary component of such procedures is adequate notice that counsel will be expected to produce the documentary evidence and witness testimony on which the petition rests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Habeas Corpus Rule 11 commands the federal courts to apply the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \"to the extent that they are not inconsistent with these rules.\"  The notion of fair and adequate notice permeates the Civil Rules.  Rule 12(c), for example, provides that if a court considers matters outside the pleadings in determining whether to enter judgment, the motion shall be considered as one for summary judgment \"and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion.\"  Similarly, Rule 56 has consistently been interpreted to require both (1) \"fair notice\" to the nonmovant that he is expected to present controverting evidence, so as to avoid \"unfair surprise\" in the summary resolution of the dispute;  and (2) a \"reasonable opportunity\" to present such evidence.   <i>Macklin v.

Notwithstanding the expedited scheduling of habeas petitions in capital cases, these requirements are not \"inconsistent\" with the Habeas Rules.

Instead, Stephens will go to the electric chair on the strength of a finding that the evidentiary hearing he so fervently has sought has, in fact, already been held.  This resolution does not comport with the administration of the Great Writ \"as law and justice require.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2243.

That action was not finally terminated until September 19, 1983, when the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit on remand from this Court considered and rejected the remaining claims in Stephens' first habeas petition. Over the next six weeks, Stephens' counsel investigated possible claims to raise in a second habeas petition and drafted the appropriate papers.  On November 1, 1983, the Superior Court of Bleckley County, Ga., set Stephens' execution date for November 16, 1983.  Stephens filed his second state habeas petition on November 7 in the Superior Court of Butts County.  One week later, on November 14, those state proceedings were concluded when the Supreme Court of Georgia denied Stephens' application for a certificate of probable cause to appeal the lower state court's denial of his petition.  Stephens filed his federal petition later that same afternoon.  The Supreme Court of Georgia stayed the execution to permit Stephens to pursue his federal action, and the Superior Court of Bleckley County thereafter reset Stephens's execution for December 14, 1983.

Petitioner alleges that a 1980 study by a Dr. David Baldus supports his claim.  This is a similar contention to that made in <i>Spencer.</i>  Here, however, the similarity ends.  In <i>Spencer,</i> which involved a first petition for habeas corpus, the so-called Baldus study was proffered as evidence at the district court hearing.  A panel of this court held that the evidence as proffered was material and should have been received.  In the present case the issue arose at a hearing concerning abuse of the writ but no such proffer was made by petitioner.
