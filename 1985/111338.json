Coons' suit has clarified the New Jersey law on the subject, and in striking down the New Jersey statute I think that the Supreme Court of New Jersey has gone beyond any of our Commerce Clause decisions.

New Jersey provides a 2-year statute of limitations for the type of injury suffered by Coons.  N.J.Stat.Ann. &#167; 2A:14-2 (West 1952).  Coons waited four years, however, and brought suit in state court against Honda Motor Co. (American Honda) and its parent Honda Motor Co. of Japan (Honda of Japan).  American Honda had a certificate to do business in New Jersey, as required by N.J.Stat.Ann. &#167; 14A:13-4 (West 1969);  Honda of Japan had no certificate.  Because Honda of Japan had no certificate it was not \"represented\" in New Jersey under N.J.Stat.Ann. &#167; 2A:14-22 (West 1952), and that statute therefore tolled the 2-year limitations period for all unrepresented corporations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Thus American Honda successfully asserted a statute of limitations defense to Coons' complaint, but Honda of Japan could not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A divided New Jersey Supreme Court held that interstate commerce was unconstitutionally burdened by &#167; 14-22's requirement that a foreign corporation must qualify to do business in New Jersey before it could avail itself of the statute of limitations provided in N.J.Stat.Ann. &#167; 2A:14-2 (West 1952).  The court relied on, <i>inter alia,</i> our holdings in <i>Allenberg Cotton Co. v. Pittman,</i> 419 U.S. 20, 95 S.Ct. 260, 42 L.Ed.2d 195 (1974), and <i>Sioux Remedy Co. v.

Although both <i>Allenberg Cotton</i> and <i>Sioux Remedy</i> involved States which closed their courts entirely to foreign corporations, the New Jersey Supreme Court held that the rationale of those cases extended to the mere tolling of a statute of limitations against corporations unrepresented in the State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I am not so sure that <i>Allenberg Cotton</i> and <i>Sioux Remedy</i> can be taken so far.  The States involved in those cases totally barred foreign corporations from the state courts.  Thus out-of-state corporations which entered into contracts in-state had no forum in which to enforce those contracts, and out-of-state competition was effectively precluded.  New Jersey, however, provides greater protection to the contractual and legal interests of foreign corporations.

The cross-petition, No. 84-591, was filed under this Court's Rule 19.5, and this Court should grant both the main petition and cross-petitions in order to reach the latter.  See this Court's Rules 19.5, 20.5.  If we were to reverse the New Jersey Supreme Court's Commerce Clause holding, there would be no need to address the issue presented in the main petition.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ", "id": 111338, "judges": "", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/111338/", "sha1": "76ee0a4e1b4953f4606b6cdcb3373546941ae98d", "source": "R", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T10:13:10"}
