After a period of indecision concerning the disposition of the fetuses, during which the District Attorney's office was contacted by several groups, religious and otherwise, offering various means of disposal, the District Attorney made public his decision to turn the fetuses over to a religious organization for the purpose of holding a burial service, and subsequently arranged for interment in a private cemetery that had offered its space to the State free of charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime appellee organization had filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against the District Attorney, in the California courts, seeking to prevent him from turning over the fetuses to a religious group on the ground that such an action would violate the Establishment Clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions.  Appellants thereafter contracted with the private cemetery to hold a religious burial service when the fetuses were interred, and to place a memorial plaque at the site.  The California Court of Appeals held that the District Attorney's proposal to turn the fetuses over to a religious organization for purposes of holding a memorial service would violate the Establishment Clause of the California Constitution, and another provision of the California Constitution prohibiting state action indicating a \"preference\" for any particular religion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The California Supreme Court denied review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The California Court of Appeals found the District Attorney's proposed actions prohibited by independent religion clauses of the California Constitution.

Appellants contend, however, that as applied the California Constitution's provisions have the effect of denying them their rights to free speech, assembly, and exercise of religion protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  I think that appellants' federal claims are insubstantial.  Nothing in the order of the California Court prevents appellants from assembling for purposes of expressing their views with respect to abortion, or from holding a religious or other memorial service.  Appellants would find in the First Amendment's Speech or Religion Clauses a right to hold their service as an incident to the actual burial of the fetuses.  But the First Amendment does not entitle appellants to have the State enhance the impact of their speech by providing the subjects of a funeral service.  The proper disposition of these fetuses is peculiarly a question governed by the law of the State of California.  The California courts have held that California laws concerned with avoiding the entanglement of the State with religious causes prohibit the District Attorney from turning the fetuses over to appellants for the holding of a religious service. Because I can find nothing in the First Amendment that is contravened by the Court of Appeals' holding, I am satisfied that this Court would not wish to give this case plenary consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The application for a stay is accordingly denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Appellants claim that this Court would have appellate jurisdiction over this case under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1257(2).
