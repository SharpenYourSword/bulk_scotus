They seek to present a next friend petition for writ of habeas corpus on behalf of their son, while their son refuses to seek collateral review of his conviction or death sentence and resists his parents' efforts to secure such review.  The son's reason for wanting no review is that he desires to die as quickly as possible so as to end feelings of intolerable depression that plague him.  A Federal District Court found that Charles Rumbaugh was mentally competent to waive his rights and thus to assure his own death, and it accordingly dismissed the petition for writ of habeas corpus. <i>Rumbaugh v. Estelle,</i> 558 F.Supp. 651 (ND Tex.1983).  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  <i>Rumbaugh v. Procunier,</i> 753 F.2d 395 (CA5 1985). The issue presented is whether those determinations comported with the standard for waiver set forth in <i>Rees v. Peyton,</i> 384 U.S. 312, 86 S.Ct. 1505, 16 L.Ed.2d 583 (1966).  Because the decisions below substantially strayed from the <i>Rees</i> standard, so that they, in essence, allow a state capital punishment scheme to become an instrument for the effectuation of a suicide by a mentally ill man, I dissent from the denial of certiorari.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Rees</i> specified the findings necessary to a determination that one who seeks to waive further review of a criminal conviction is competent to make such a grave choice.

The courts below relied on a determination that Rumbaugh \"logically\" chose death <i>because</i> he had become a victim of mental illness, suffering from \"frequent bouts of paranoia,\" \"auditory hallucinations,\" and severe \"depression.\"  Rumbaugh seeks death because he knows himself to be mentally ill and has lost hope of obtaining treatment.  If not for his illness and his pessimism regarding access to treatment, he would probably continue to challenge his death sentence;  but faced with his vision of life without treatment for severe mental illness, Rumbaugh chooses to die.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The choice the courts below describe is a choice of a desperate man seeking to use the State's machinery of death as a tool of suicide.  It is no more nor less rational than the tragic choices of those driven to suicide by their tormented inner lives in a myriad of contexts.  Although the District Court and the divided panel of the Fifth Circuit determined that Rumbaugh was rational in his calculation that continued life would for him bring misery, this was not the sort of free and uncoerced \"rational\" choice that we required in <i>Rees.</i>  As Circuit Judge Goldberg said in dissent below:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[R]ational choice requires that the ends of [a person's]      actions are <i>his</i> ends.  That is, rational choice embraces      'autonomous' choice.
