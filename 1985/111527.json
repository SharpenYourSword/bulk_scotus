In <i>Adams,</i> the Court of Appeals held that it had jurisdiction over an appeal from a grant of a temporary restraining order because the order in question \"did not merely preserve the status quo pending further proceedings, but commanded an unprecedented action irreversibly altering\" a delicate balance involving the foreign relations of the United States.  <i>Id.,</i> at 44, 570 F.2d, at 953.  Again, however, in contrast to <i>Adams,</i> the District Court in this case <i>denied</i> the temporary restraining order.  Its denial merely allows implementation of regulations in accordance with the express intent of Congress.  Only if the District Court <i>granted</i> the temporary restraining order would it have disturbed the status quo.  Moreover, the District Court's grant of a temporary restraining order in <i>Adams</i> was extraordinary.  It \"deeply intrude[d] into the core concerns of the executive branch,\" <i>id.,</i> at 45, 570 F.2d, at 954, and \"direct[ed] action . . . potent with consequences . . . irretrievable,\" <i>id.,</i> at 44, 570 F.2d, at 953. The consequences of the District Court's order in the present case were not nearly so grave.
