In that case, the Court upheld the provisions of the Price-Anderson Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2210, which place a dollar limit on total liability that would be incurred by a defendant in the event of a nuclear accident.  One of the objections raised against the liability limitation provisions was that they violated due process by failing to provide those injured by a nuclear accident with an adequate <i>quid pro quo</i> for the common-law right of recovery which the Act displaced.  The Court noted:  It is not at all clear that the Due Process Clause in fact requires that a legislatively enacted compensation scheme either duplicate the recovery at common law or provide a reasonable substitute remedy.

Nevertheless, the court went on to find that the imposition of a damages cap on malpractice claims did not provide a sufficient <i>quid pro quo</i> for the severely injured malpractice plaintiff, as his loss of recovery was offset only by lower medical costs for all recipients of medical care, and he received no specific benefit in return.  <i>Id.,</i> at 136, citing <i>Wright v.
