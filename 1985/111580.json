Petitioner requested and received no fewer than three continuances.  The trial was finally set for May 12, 1980.

That court noted that petitioner had \"succeeded in delaying implementation of Mrs. Clement's bequests for three years, possibly longer if this matter goes to a higher court.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 703.  The court concluded that Judge Duran had not abused his discretion, after granting three continuances, in refusing to grant a fourth.

Petitioner contended that the state trial court, by refusing his request for a fourth continuance, had deprived him of due process of law.  He named as defendants the Clerk of the Orleans Parish Civil District Court, Dan Foley;  the Succession of Laura Clement;  the executor of the will, Thomas Keller;  and Judge Duran.  The defendants, respondents in this Court, moved for dismissal of the action.  The District Court correctly granted the motion, concluding that the complaint should be dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim.

Petitioner's suit was brought in the face of the \"well-settled rule\" that a plaintiff may not seek reversal of a state-court judgment simply by casting his complaint in the form of a civil rights action;  Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit precedent \"clearly prohibit[ed]\" the effort made by petitioner. The Court of Appeals also held that the District Court had properly dismissed petitioner's suit for failure to state a claim. The court explained that ordinarily it would not be inclined to give this issue any attention since the District Court's judgment in its entirety could be affirmed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  However, \"to further demonstrate the frivolousness of the appeal,\" the court addressed this point as well, concluding that the trial court had properly dismissed the claims against all defendants on this basis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court assessed double costs and fees against both petitioner and his attorney under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 and under 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1912 and 1927;  it held that petitioner had imposed an unnecessary burden on it and had infringed upon the right of respondents to have a prompt adjudication of this dispute.  The court noted, however, that awarding costs against petitioner alone would not deter his attorney from bringing similar frivolous appeals in the future.

In his filing to this Court, however, petitioner did not attempt to refute the careful analysis of the Court of Appeals.

But Foley was without any power or authority under state law to grant or deny continuances.  Moreover, there was no allegation that Foley was involved in any sort of a conspiracy to deprive petitioner of his constitutional rights.  Indeed, the complaint did not even allege any act or omission on Foley's part that caused injury. Petitioner had also named the succession of Laura Clement and Thomas Keller, the executor of the estate, as defendants.  But, the Fifth Circuit noted, in order to sustain an action under &#167; 1983, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant, acting under color of state law, deprived him of a right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States.  Petitioner had not alleged that either the succession or Keller had conspired with the state trial court.  In fact, petitioner's complaint contained no allegation or facts concerning either of these defendants, only the conclusion that petitioner was entitled to damages from them. Finally, the Fifth Circuit considered the claims against state trial judge Melvin Duran.  Judges are clearly entitled to absolute immunity from &#167; 1983 suits involving actions taken in their judicial capacity.
