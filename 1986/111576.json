Apparently, the Court disagrees with the Ninth Circuit's application of that standard. However, the Court's reversal is not accompanied by a review of the District Court's factual findings or a determination that they are not, in fact, \"clearly erroneous.\"  The Court is thus spared the necessity of explaining the apparent inconsistencies in the District Court's findings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The Court is thus spared the necessity of addressing the fact that petitioners' own rendition of the incidents in question suggests that the District Court's findings give a less than complete accounting of certain events events that may well influence a court's view of the matter at hand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Court is spared the necessity of analyzing the District Court's factual findings in the context of the record.

The Court's refusal to undertake such a review for its summary disposition in the case before us is especially disturbing when it is recalled that, under current Court practice, the petitioner does not usually file the record with a petition for certiorari.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my judgment, this Court does not use its scarce resources wisely when it undertakes to engage in the <i>de novo</i> review of factual records in relatively routine litigation.

When such review is necessary to a disposition, however, and the Court fails to provide it, the problems of this Court's review are still more troubling.

However, the Court's reversal is not accompanied by a review of the District Court's factual findings or a determination that they are not, in fact, \"clearly erroneous.\"  The Court is thus spared the necessity of explaining the apparent inconsistencies in the District Court's findings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The Court is thus spared the necessity of addressing the fact that petitioners' own rendition of the incidents in question suggests that the District Court's findings give a less than complete accounting of certain events events that may well influence a court's view of the matter at hand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Court is spared the necessity of analyzing the District Court's factual findings in the context of the record. The absence of such an analysis is somewhat puzzling.  The entirety of the majority's analysis is a reference to <i>Anderson v. Bessemer City,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span>, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).  In that case, the Court found it necessary to review the record before it reversed the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the District Court's findings were clearly erroneous.  <i>Id.,</i> at 576-581, 105 S.Ct., at 1512-1515.  The Court's refusal to undertake such a review for its summary disposition in the case before us is especially disturbing when it is recalled that, under current Court practice, the petitioner does not usually file the record with a petition for certiorari.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my judgment, this Court does not use its scarce resources wisely when it undertakes to engage in the <i>de novo</i> review of factual records in relatively routine litigation.  Cf. <i>United States v. Hasting,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110933\"><a href=\"/opinion/110933/united-states-v-hasting/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 516-518, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 1984-1985, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).  When such review is necessary to a disposition, however, and the Court fails to provide it, the problems of this Court's review are still more troubling.  For, like a court of appeals that issues an opinion that may not be printed or cited, this Court then engages in decision-making without the discipline and accountability that the preparation of opinions requires.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I respectfully dissent from the Court's summary reversal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice BRENNAN dissents from the Court's summary reversal substantially for the reasons stated by Justice STEVENS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1--2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1--2_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The proliferation of this secret law has prompted extensive comment.
