The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the Commission's order over petitioner's objection that the notification order was not within the Commission's remedial authority under &#167; 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 38 Stat. 719, as amended, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 45.  768 F.2d 1171 (1985).
