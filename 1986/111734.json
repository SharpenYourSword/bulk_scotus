The court believed that <i>Douglas v. Alabama,</i> 380 U.S. 415, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965), was \"directly on point\" and mandated the reversal of respondent's conviction because there had been no opportunity for respondent to cross-examine the codefendant, either at the time the statement was made or at trial.  103 N.M. 95, 98-99, 703 P.2d 872, 875-876 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As <i>Lee v.

Although <i>Ohio v.
