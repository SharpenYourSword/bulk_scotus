See, <i>e.g., Irvin v. Dowd,</i> 366 U.S. 717, 721-722, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 1641-1642, 6 L.Ed.2d 751 (1961).  This Court has held that due process requires both \"a jury capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before it, and a trial judge ever watchful to prevent prejudicial occurrences and to determine the effect of such occurrences when they happen.\"  <i>Smith v. Phillips,</i> 455 U.S. 209, 217, 102 S.Ct. 940, 946, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982).  When a substantial question of juror bias is presented to the trial court, as it was in this case, we have held that the defendant is entitled to a hearing \" 'with all interested parties permitted to participate.' \"  <i>Id.,</i> at 216, 102 S.Ct., at 945 (quoting <i>Remmer v. United States,</i> 347 U.S. 227, 230, 74 S.Ct. 450, 451, 98 L.Ed. 654 (1954).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under <i>Smith v. Phillips, supra,</i> the trial judge's inquiry into juror bias in this case fell far short of the minimum required by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The judge merely called on the juror to identify herself and then asked her \"several times in a leading fashion to reaffirm that her acquaintance with the mother did not influence her\" in a colloquy that \"could have lasted only seconds.\"  <i>People v. Porter, supra,</i> 111 Ill.2d, at 410, 95 Ill.Dec., at 475, 489 N.E.2d, at 1339 (Simon, J., dissenting).  The trial judge failed to ascertain to any meaningful degree the extent and nature of her relationship with the victim's mother and the point at which she became aware that she was acquainted with the mother.  The juror's vague statement that she realized it \"[a]fter it had got started and everything was going on\" suggests only that she was not aware of it at voir dire.  She was never asked to explain why she had not brought the matter to the court's attention when she realized the connection;  had she done so, one of the alternate jurors could have taken her place.  Moreover, the trial court did not allow defense counsel to question her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State contends that petitioner had an opportunity to explore the issue of bias at the post-trial hearing on his motion for a new trial.  That hearing, however, was woefully inadequate when measured by our decisions in <i>Phillips</i> and <i>Remmer.</i>  At a minimum, due process requires that the defendant be allowed to question the juror on the issue of bias.  See <i>Smith v. Phillips, supra,</i> 455 U.S., at 217 n. 7, 102 S.Ct., at 946 n. 7 (\"determinations in <i>Remmer</i>-type hearings will frequently turn upon the testimony of the juror in question\");  see also <i>id.,</i> at 222, 102 S.Ct., at 948 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring).  The Illinois Supreme Court criticized defense counsel for failing to call Mrs. Trigleth or obtain an affidavit from her, <i>People v. Porter, supra,</i> 111 Ill.2d, at 403, 95 Ill.Dec., at 472, 489 N.E.2d, at 1336. However, in light of the trial judge's insistence on the sanctity of the jury's deliberation and his refusal to allow defense counsel to question Mrs. Trigleth while she was under oath, counsel reasonably considered himself foreclosed from contacting her in connection with his motion for a new trial before the same judge.  Thus, while petitioner had the burden of showing both bias and actual prejudice, the trial judge's admonitions appeared to deprive him of the only means of doing so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I continue to believe that the defendant should not bear the burden of showing actual prejudice when the probability of bias is substantial, as it is in this case, see <i>Smith v. Phillips, supra,</i> 455 U.S., at 224, 102 S.Ct., at 949 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). However, petitioner never even had the opportunity of demonstrating prejudice due to juror bias.  This violated his right to due process and leaves in doubt the impartiality of the jury that convicted him in this capital case.

When a substantial question of juror bias is presented to the trial court, as it was in this case, we have held that the defendant is entitled to a hearing \" 'with all interested parties permitted to participate.' \"  <i>Id.,</i> at 216, 102 S.Ct., at 945 (quoting <i>Remmer v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105202\"><a href=\"/opinion/105202/remmer-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span>, 230, 74 S.Ct. 450, 451, 98 L.Ed. 654 (1954).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under <i>Smith v. Phillips, supra,</i> the trial judge's inquiry into juror bias in this case fell far short of the minimum required by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The judge merely called on the juror to identify herself and then asked her \"several times in a leading fashion to reaffirm that her acquaintance with the mother did not influence her\" in a colloquy that \"could have lasted only seconds.\"  <i>People v. Porter, supra,</i> 111 Ill.2d, at 410, 95 Ill.Dec., at 475, 489 N.E.2d, at 1339 (Simon, J., dissenting).  The trial judge failed to ascertain to any meaningful degree the extent and nature of her relationship with the victim's mother and the point at which she became aware that she was acquainted with the mother.  The juror's vague statement that she realized it \"[a]fter it had got started and everything was going on\" suggests only that she was not aware of it at voir dire.  She was never asked to explain why she had not brought the matter to the court's attention when she realized the connection;  had she done so, one of the alternate jurors could have taken her place.  Moreover, the trial court did not allow defense counsel to question her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State contends that petitioner had an opportunity to explore the issue of bias at the post-trial hearing on his motion for a new trial.  That hearing, however, was woefully inadequate when measured by our decisions in <i>Phillips</i> and <i>Remmer.</i>  At a minimum, due process requires that the defendant be allowed to question the juror on the issue of bias.  See <i>Smith v. Phillips, supra,</i> 455 U.S., at 217 n. 7, 102 S.Ct., at 946 n. 7 (\"determinations in <i>Remmer</i>-type hearings will frequently turn upon the testimony of the juror in question\");  see also <i>id.,</i> at 222, 102 S.Ct., at 948 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring).  The Illinois Supreme Court criticized defense counsel for failing to call Mrs. Trigleth or obtain an affidavit from her, <i>People v. Porter, supra,</i> 111 Ill.2d, at 403, 95 Ill.Dec., at 472, 489 N.E.2d, at 1336. However, in light of the trial judge's insistence on the sanctity of the jury's deliberation and his refusal to allow defense counsel to question Mrs. Trigleth while she was under oath, counsel reasonably considered himself foreclosed from contacting her in connection with his motion for a new trial before the same judge.  Thus, while petitioner had the burden of showing both bias and actual prejudice, the trial judge's admonitions appeared to deprive him of the only means of doing so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I continue to believe that the defendant should not bear the burden of showing actual prejudice when the probability of bias is substantial, as it is in this case, see <i>Smith v. Phillips, supra,</i> 455 U.S., at 224, 102 S.Ct., at 949 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). However, petitioner never even had the opportunity of demonstrating prejudice due to juror bias.  This violated his right to due process and leaves in doubt the impartiality of the jury that convicted him in this capital case.  Accordingly, I dissent from denial of the petition for certiorari.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> The trial transcript incorrectly lists the juror's name as Tricklet, rather than Trigleth.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ", "id": 111803, "judges": "", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/111803/", "sha1": "4faeff3a316ee601f86ea26972214a0e6b6121c4", "source": "R", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T10:13:24"}
