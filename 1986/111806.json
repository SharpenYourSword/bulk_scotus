The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed the jury's determination of guilt, but remanded for resentencing due to the prosecutor's improper references to appellate review.  <i>Wiley v. State,</i> 449 So.2d 756 (Miss.1984).  At the second sentencing proceeding, petitioner once again received a sentence of death.  The jury found three statutory aggravating circumstances and insufficient mitigating circumstances to outweigh the aggravating circumstances.  The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's conviction and death sentence, with three justices concurring in the judgment. <i>Wiley v.

The death sentence may be imposed only where the murder falls into one of seven narrowly defined classes.  Miss. Code Ann. &#167; 97-3-19(2)(a)-(g) (Supp.1985).  Petitioner was convicted under a section of the statute that classifies murder committed by a person engaged in a robbery as capital murder.  Miss. Code Ann. &#167; 97-3-19(2)(e) (Supp.1985).  Once the jury found him guilty of the capital offense, it then had to find at least one aggravating circumstance, in order to impose the death penalty.  See Miss. Code Ann. &#167; 99-19-101(5)(a)-(h) (Supp.1985) (listing aggravating circumstances).  In this case, the jury found three statutory aggravating circumstances:  \"[t]he capital offense was committed while the defendant was engaged . . . in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, any robbery,\" \"[t]he capital offense was committed for pecuniary gain,\" and \"[t]he capital offense was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel.\"  Miss.

But under the Mississippi capital sentencing statute, Miss. Code Ann. &#167; 99-19-103 (Supp.1985), the jury was instructed to balance aggravating against mitigating circumstances.

Accordingly, any murder committed during the course of a robbery is <i>ipso facto</i> committed for pecuniary gain.  The Mississippi Supreme Court rejected petitioner's arguments against double-counting these aggravating circumstances, over the objection of a concurring Justice who stated that \"[T]he fallacy of our rule is its failure to recognize that murders are aggravated by a defendant's conduct, not by the statutory language. . . .  <i>A single, legally indivisible act of the defendant may rationally aggravate a murder but once.</i>\"  <i>Wiley v.

But under the Mississippi capital sentencing statute, Miss. Code Ann. &#167; 99-19-103 (Supp.1985), the jury was instructed to balance aggravating against mitigating circumstances.  While the jury might have returned a verdict of death even if there had been only one aggravating circumstance, we cannot be sure that it would have done so in view of the mitigating factors presented;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  the jury's verdict merely stated that \"there are insufficient mitigating factors <i>to outweigh</i> the aggravating circumstances.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 342 (emphasis supplied). Under the circumstances, I believe that the sentencer's \"consideration of . . . improper aggravating circumstance[s] so infects the balancing process\" created by the Mississippi statute \"that it is constitutionally impermissible . . . to let the sentence stand.\"  <i>Barclay v.
