Although petitioner testified that the mother had not even entered the store before he left and that he had not intended to kill or harm anyone, the jury was instructed \"that malice is implied or presumed from the use of a deadly weapon.\"  After his conviction and death sentence were affirmed by the South Carolina Supreme Court, petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus from that court, arguing, <i>inter alia,</i> that the burden-shifting instruction given at trial was unconstitutional under <i>Sandstrom v. Montana,</i> 442 U.S. 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39.  While the habeas corpus application was pending, petitioner also called to the state court's attention this Court's subsequent decision in <i>Francis v. Franklin,</i> 471 U.S. 307, 105 S.Ct. 1965, 85 L.Ed.2d 344.  After this Court summarily vacated the state court's summary denial of the writ and remanded the case \"for further consideration in light of <i>Francis,</i>\" the state court, although acknowledging that the jury instruction suffered from the same infirmities addressed in <i>Francis,</i> denied relief on state-law grounds without considering whether <i>Francis</i> might apply retroactively and without discussing <i>Sandstrom.</i></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Held:</i>  As a matter of federal law, petitioner's conviction cannot stand in light of <i>Francis.</i>  Pp. 215-218.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) <i>Sandstrom,</i> which had been decided before petitioner's trial took place, established that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits jury instructions that have the effect of relieving the State of its burden of proof on the critical question of intent in a criminal prosecution.  <i>Francis</i> was merely an application of that governing principle. Accordingly, respondent's argument that a newly announced constitutional rule should not generally be applied retroactively to cases pending on collateral review cannot operate to deny petitioner the benefit of <i>Francis.</i>  That argument simply does not apply where the \"new\" holding is merely an application of a rule that was well settled at the time of conviction.  Pp. 215-217.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) The State's contention that it has the authority to establish the scope of its own habeas corpus proceedings and to refuse therein to apply a new rule of federal constitutional law retroactively is rejected since <i>Francis</i> did not announce a new rule and since the state court's opinion does not place any limit on the issues it will entertain in collateral proceedings.

His conviction and sentence were affirmed by the South Carolina Supreme Court in 1982.   <i>State v.

The jury, however, was instructed \"that malice is implied or presumed from the use of a deadly weapon.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  A few months after petitioner's conviction was affirmed, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that it was error to give such an instruction.  See <i>State v. Elmore,</i> 279 S.C. 417, 308 S.E.2d 781 (1983).  Thereafter, petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus from the South Carolina Supreme Court, arguing that the burden-shifting instruction given at his trial was unconstitutional under the state court's reasoning in <i>Elmore</i> and under our decision in <i>Sandstrom v. Montana,</i> 442 U.S. 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979).  While the application for habeas corpus was pending, we decided another case involving a burden-shifting instruction, <i>Francis v. Franklin,</i> 471 U.S. 307, 105 S.Ct. 1965, 85 L.Ed.2d 344 (1985), and petitioner promptly called that decision to the attention of the State Supreme Court.

Aiken,</i> 474 U.S. 896, 106 S.Ct. 218, 88 L.Ed.2d 218 (1985).  On remand, the state court determined that the jury instruction at petitioner's trial \"suffered from the same infirmities present in <i>Elmore</i> and addressed in <i>Francis v. Franklin.</i>\"  290 S.C. 231, 232, 349 S.E.2d 84, 85 (1986). Nevertheless, the court held that petitioner was not entitled to relief.  As an explanation for its holding, the court stated that its decision in <i>Elmore</i> should not be applied retroactively to invalidate a conviction that was final when <i>Elmore</i> was decided. The opinion did not consider whether the decision in <i>Francis v. Franklin</i> might apply retroactively and also did not discuss our decision in <i>Sandstrom v.

Moreover, he reasoned, given our decision in <i>Sandstrom v.

This 'bedrock, \"axiomatic and elementary\"      [constitutional] principle,' <i>id.,</i> at 363 [90 S.Ct., at 1072],      prohibits the State from using evidentiary presumptions in a      jury charge that have the effect of relieving the State of      its burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt of every      essential element of a crime.  <i>Sandstrom v.

To decide this case, however, it is not necessary to determine whether we should go further and adopt Justice Harlan's reasoning as to the retroactivity of cases announcing new constitutional rules to cases pending on collateral review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Justice Harlan believed that most collateral attacks on final judgments should be resolved by reference to the state of the law at the time of the petitioner's conviction, he emphasized the proposition that many \"new\" holdings are merely applications of principles that were well settled at the time of conviction. As he explained in <i>Desist:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The theory that the habeas petitioner is entitled to      the law prevailing at the time of his conviction is, however,      one which is more complex than the Court has seemingly      recognized.  First, it is necessary to determine whether a      particular decision has really announced a 'new' rule at all      or whether it has simply applied a well-established      constitutional principle to govern a case which is closely      analogous to those which have been previously considered in      the prior case law. . . .  One need not be a rigid partisan      of Blackstone to recognize that many, though not all, of this      Court's constitutional decisions are grounded upon      fundamental principles whose content does not change      dramatically from year to year, but whose meanings are      altered slowly and subtly as generation succeeds generation.      In such a context it appears very difficult to argue against      the application of the 'new' rule in all habeas cases since      one could never say with any assurance that this Court would      have ruled differently at the time the petitioner's      conviction became final.\"  394 U.S., at 263-264, 89 S.Ct., at      1041.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This reasoning, which we previously have endorsed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> is controlling in this case because our decision in <i>Francis</i> was merely an application of the principle that governed our decision in <i>Sandstrom v.

Today we      reaffirm the rule of <i>Sandstrom</i> and the wellspring due process      principle from which it was drawn.

Our mandate contemplated that the state court would consider whether, as a matter of federal law, petitioner's conviction could stand in the light of <i>Francis.</i> Since the state court did not decide that question, we shall do so.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The South Carolina Attorney General submits that we should adopt Justice Harlan's theory that a newly announced constitutional rule should not be applied retroactively to cases pending on collateral review unless the rule places \"certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe,\" <i>Mackey</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 401 U. S. 667, 692 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), or enunciates a procedural rule that is \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\" <i>id.,</i> at 693. Under this theory, the Attorney General argues, petitioner would not be entitled to the benefit of our ruling in <i>Franklin.</i></p>\n<p>We have already endorsed Justice Harlan's retroactivity analysis for cases pending on direct appeal, see <i>Griffith</i> v. <i>Kentucky,</i> 479 U. S. 314, 322 (1987); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Johnson,</i> 457 U. S. 537 (1982), and we have noted, as Justice Harlan did, <i>Mackey, supra,</i> at 682-687; <i>Desist</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 394 U. S. 244, 260 (1969) (Harlan, J., dissenting), the important distinction between direct review and collateral review. Compare <i>Allen</i> v. <i>Hardy,</i> 478 U.

S. 551 (1987) (right to appointed counsel on direct appeal not applicable in collateral proceedings). To decide this case, however, it is not necessary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*216</span> to determine whether we should go further and adopt Justice Harlan's reasoning as to the retroactivity of cases announcing new constitutional rules to cases pending on collateral review.</p>\n<p>Although Justice Harlan believed that most collateral attacks on final judgments should be resolved by reference to the state of the law at the time of the petitioner's conviction, he emphasized the proposition that many \"new\" holdings are merely applications of principles that were well settled at the time of conviction. As he explained in <i>Desist:</i></p>\n<blockquote>\"The theory that the habeas petitioner is entitled to the law prevailing at the time of his conviction is, however, one which is more complex than the Court has seemingly recognized. First, it is necessary to determine whether a particular decision has really announced a `new' rule at all or whether it has simply applied a well-established constitutional principle to govern a case which is closely analogous to those which have been previously considered in the prior case law. . . . One need not be a rigid partisan of Blackstone to recognize that many, though not all, of this Court's constitutional decisions are grounded upon fundamental principles whose content does not change dramatically from year to year, but whose meanings are altered slowly and subtly as generation succeeds generation. In such a context it appears very difficult to argue against the application of the `new' rule in all habeas cases since one could never say with any assurance that this Court would have ruled differently at the time the petitioner's conviction became final.\" 394 U.

After petitioner left the store, a fight occurred in which the accomplice and the storekeeper's mother were both killed. Petitioner was convicted of murder and armed robbery and sentenced to death. His conviction and sentence were affirmed by the South Carolina Supreme Court in 1982. <i>State</i> v. <i>Yates,</i> 280 S. C. 29, 310 S. E. 2d 805, cert. denied, 462 U. S. 1124 (1983).</p>\n<p>At his trial, petitioner testified that the victim had not even entered the store before he left and that he had not intended to kill or to harm anyone. The jury, however, was instructed \"that malice is implied or presumed from the use of a deadly weapon.\"<sup>[1]</sup> A few months after petitioner's conviction was affirmed, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that it was error to give such an instruction. See <i>State</i> v. <i>Elmore,</i> 279 S. C. 417, 308 S. E. 2d 781 (1983). Thereafter, petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus from the South Carolina Supreme Court, arguing that the burden-shifting instruction given at his trial was unconstitutional under the state court's reasoning in <i>Elmore</i> and under our decision in <i>Sandstrom</i> v. <i>Montana,</i> 442 U. S. 510 (1979). While the application for habeas corpus was pending, we decided another <span class=\"star-pagination\">*213</span> case involving a burden-shifting instruction, <i>Francis</i> v. <i>Franklin,</i> 471 U. S. 307 (1985), and petitioner promptly called that decision to the attention of the State Supreme Court.
