As to the failure to amend the zoning ordinance (which is all that concerns us here), the court found discriminatory impact because a disproportionately high percentage of households that use and that would be eligible for subsidized rental units are minorities, and because the ordinance restricts private construction of low-income housing to the largely minority urban renewal area, which \"significantly perpetuated segregation in the Town.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 938.  The court declared that in order to rebut this prima facie case, appellants had to put forth \"bona fide and legitimate\" reasons for their action and had to demonstrate that no \"less discriminatory alternative can serve those ends.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 939.  The court found appellants' rationale for refusal to amend the ordinance&#8212;that the restriction of multifamily projects to the urban renewal area would encourage developers to invest in a deteriorated and needy section of town clearly inadequate.
