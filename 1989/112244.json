S. 1095. Since October Term 1986, petitioner has filed 22 petitions for certiorari with the Court. We denied him leave to proceed <i>in forma pauperis</i> with respect to 19 of those petitions, and he paid the docketing fee required by this Court's Rule 45(a) on one occasion.<sup>[1]</sup> He also filed one petition for rehearing.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*90</span> This Court's Rule 46.1 requires that \"[a] party desiring to proceed in this Court <i>in forma pauperis</i> shall file a motion for leave to so proceed, together with his affidavit in the form prescribed in Fed. Rules App. Proc., Form 4 . . . setting forth with particularity facts showing that he comes within the statutory requirements.\" Our decision to deny a petitioner leave to proceed <i>in forma pauperis</i> is based on our review of the information contained in the supporting affidavit of indigency.<sup>[3]</sup> In petitioner's case, a review of the affidavits <span class=\"star-pagination\">*91</span> he has filed with his last nine petitions for certiorari indicates that his financial condition has remained substantially unchanged.<sup>[4]</sup> The Court denied him leave to proceed <i>in forma pauperis</i> with respect to each petition. Petitioner has nonetheless continued to file for leave to proceed <i>in forma pauperis.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*92</span> In <i>In re McDonald,</i> 489 U. S. 180, 184 (1989), we said: \"Every paper filed with the Clerk of this Court, no matter how repetitious or frivolous, requires some portion of the institution's limited resources. A part of the Court's responsibility is to see that these resources are allocated in a way that promotes the interests of justice.\" We do not think that justice is served if the Court continues to process petitioner's requests to proceed <i>in forma pauperis</i> when his financial condition has not changed from that reflected in a previous filing in which he was denied leave to proceed <i>in forma pauperis.</i></p>\n<p>We direct the Clerk of the Court not to accept any further filings from petitioner in which he seeks leave to proceed <i>in forma pauperis</i> under this Court's Rule 46.1, unless the affidavit submitted with the filing indicates that petitioner's financial condition has substantially changed from that reflected in the affidavits submitted by him in <i>Wrenn</i> v. <i>Benson</i> and <i>Wrenn</i> v. <i>Ohio Dept. of Mental Health,</i> 489 U. S. 1095 (1989).</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I dissent from this order for the reasons stated in <i>In re McDonald,</i> 489 U. S. 180, 185 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), and in <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Herald Co.,</i> 464 U. S. 928 (1983) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Because I believe the preparation and enforcement of orders of this kind consume more of the Court's valuable time than is consumed by the routine denial of frivolous motions and petitions, see <i>In re McDonald,</i> 489 U. S. 180, 185 (1989) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting); <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Herald Co.,</i> 464 U.
