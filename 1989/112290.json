Between July 1 and July 9, 1982, grizzly bears from the park killed 20 of Christy's sheep. Requests for assistance from park rangers yielded no results, and efforts to frighten away the bears were unsuccessful.  On July 9, when two grizzlies emerged from the forest and approached Christy's sheep, he shot and killed a bear.  Grizzlies, however, are an \"endangered species\";  Christy's killing of the bear thus violated the Endangered Species Act, which makes it unlawful to \"harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect\" grizzlies and other animals protected by the statute.  16 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1538(a)(1), 1532(19).

Christy claimed, <i>inter alia,</i> that his actions in defense of his livestock were protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment;  alternatively, Christy contended that the Act resulted in an uncompensated \"taking\" of his property.  Both the District Court and the Ninth Circuit rejected these claims, and this petition ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would grant the petition for certiorari to consider Christy's constitutional claims.  Christy's claim of a constitutional right to defend his property is not insubstantial. The right to defend one's property has long been recognized at common law, see W. Blackstone, Commentaries * 138-140, and is deeply rooted in the legal traditions of this country, see, <i>e.g., Beard v. United States,</i> 158 U.S. 550, 555, 15 S.Ct. 962, 963, 39 L.Ed. 1086 (1895).

There can be little doubt that if a federal statute authorized park rangers to come around at night and take Christy's livestock to feed the bears, such a governmental action would constituted a \"taking.\" The Court of Appeals below, and the federal parties in their submission here, distinguish such a case from this one, by noting that the United States \"does not 'own' the wild animals it protects, nor does the government control the conduct of such animals.\"  <i>Christy v.

Thus, if the Government decided (in lieu of the food stamp program) to enact a law barring grocery store owners from \"harassing, harming, or pursuing\" people who wish to take food off grocery shelves without paying for it, such a law might well be suspect under the Fifth Amendment.
