The question here is whether, in this context, due process requires courts to provide a pretrial hearing to determine if some likelihood exists that the assets at issue will ultimately be subject to forfeiture.

After the denial of aid to petitioner was upheld by the Washington Supreme Court, 102 Wash.2d 624, 689 P.2d 53 (1984), this Court granted certiorari.  We reversed, 474 U.S. 481, 106 S.Ct. 748, 88 L.Ed.2d 846 (1986), concluding that the Establishment Clause presented no constitutional barrier to the vocational aid scheme, and remanded for further factual development and consideration of the program's legitimacy under the stricter dictates of the Washington Constitution's Establishment Clause.  On remand, the Washington Supreme Court again upheld the denial of aid, this time on state constitutional grounds.  112 Wash.2d 363, 771 P.2d 1119 (1989).  Petitioner now presses a free exercise claim under our <i>Sherbert v. Verner,</i> 374 U.S. 398, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963), line of cases. This case presents important federal questions regarding the free exercise rights of citizens who participate in state aid programs that permit recipients a private choice in using funds received and regarding the extent to which state involvement with religion that does not violate the Establishment Clause is required by the Free Exercise Clause.  The fact that 80 percent of the program's funding is federal also may raise significant Supremacy Clause issues.
