The Maryland Court of Appeals rejected this challenge, construing the verdict form to require unanimity in order to mark \"no\" with respect to a given mitigating circumstance, and not to preclude each juror from individually weighing any nonunanimous mitigating circumstance in considering whether to impose a death sentence.  <i>Id.,</i> at 372-373, 108 S.Ct., at 1864-1865.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we could not conclude, \"with any degree of certainty, that the jury did not adopt [Mills'] interpretation,\" <i>id.,</i> at 377, 108 S.Ct., at 1867, we vacated his death sentence.

Thus, the verdict forms and instructions used in <i>Mills</i> created the \"intuitively disturbing\" possibility that a sole juror <i>could have</i> precluded the remaining eleven jurors from considering mitigating circumstances which they all believed to exist.  <i>Id.,</i> at 373-374, 108 S.Ct., at 1864.  The prospect that a single, holdout juror could have blocked such consideration, and consequently required the jury to impose the death penalty, was an outcome \"we dare[d] not risk.\"  <i>Id.,</i> at 384, 108 S.Ct., at 1870.

Moreover, as in <i>Mills,</i> the trial court did not instruct the jury on what it should do if it could not reach a unanimous conclusion on a potential mitigating circumstance. Nowhere did the instructions even remotely suggest that jurors were free to exercise individual judgment in considering nonunanimous mitigating factors.  Rather, the jury appears to have been guided in the opposite direction by the \"as heretofore indicated\" language.  The inference that nonunanimous mitigating factors must be disregarded entirely is reinforced by the trial judge's repeated statements that the jury could impose the death penalty only if it found \"unanimously\" that no mitigating circumstances outweighed any aggravating circumstances.
