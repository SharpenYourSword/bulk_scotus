For this reason, Evans argued that his death sentence must be vacated.  The District Court stayed the execution and ordered a hearing.  Civ. No. 90-00559-R (ED Va. Oct. 13, 1990).

As Wilbert Evans' claim makes crystal clear, even the most exacting procedures are fallible.

For six years, Evans' counsel has tried to pry loose from the State copies of its investigative reports of the uprising.  Counsel steadfastly has contended that these reports would support Evans' account of the relevant events and thereby strengthen Evans' claims for both legal relief and executive clemency.  The State has refused to release its iron grip on these materials and to this moment has not made them available to him.  See Pet. for Cert., Exh. 6.</p>\n        <p>According to Evans' counsel, late last evening he was contacted by counsel for Willie Lloyd Turner, another Virginia death row inmate involved in the Mecklenberg uprising. Notwithstanding its refusal to cooperate with Evans' request for the investigative reports, the State, without protest, had provided these reports to Turner's counsel.  Upon learning of Evans' impending execution, Turner's counsel immediately delivered these materials to Evans' counsel, see <i>id.,</i> Exh. 17 and Evans has now been able to make them available to us, see <i>id.,</i> Exh. 18.</p>\n        <p>Now that Evans finally has possession of information the State has so deliberately denied him for <i>six</i> years, the State cites two isolated excerpts from a lengthy set of materials in a mean and deceitful attempt to belittle Evans' claims.  See App. to Brief in Opposition 1-2.  A more honest and thorough review of these materials, which include numerous interviews with the hostages and reports of the State's investigators, reveals that these materials in no way diminish Evans' account of the relevant events.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ", "id": 112545, "judges": "", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/112545/", "sha1": "70ed1a40023a313d6f4186ef5eaaf5e808df9020", "source": "R", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T10:13:45"}
