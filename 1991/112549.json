In <i>Pulley,</i> the Court sustained California's capital punishment statute against Eighth Amendment attack, rejecting the claim that the \"Eighth Amendment . . . requires a state appellate court, before it affirms a death sentence, to compare the sentence in the case before it with the penalties imposed in similar cases if requested to do so by the prisoner.\"  465 U.S., at 43-44, 104 S.Ct., at 876.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I dissented from the decision in <i>Pulley,</i> and I continue to believe that it was wrongly decided.
