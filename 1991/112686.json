Within the original 60-day period, the Attorney General requested additional information, which reset the 60-day clock under &#167; 5. We have upheld the Attorney General's authority to extend the time for consideration.  <i>Georgia v. United States,</i> 411 U.S. 526, 539-541, 93 S.Ct. 1702, 1710-1711, 36 L.Ed.2d 472 (1973).

After the September 3 denial of preclearance, appellants immediately sought a preliminary injunction.  After the September 13 decision of the three-judge District Court, appellants filed a motion for injunctive relief in this Court within 30 days.

The parties and candidates had notice on June 24 and again on July 12 that the Department of Justice was concerned, and that preclearance might not be forthcoming on September 3. Since September 3 they have known that the Department of Justice did not preclear the election.  Despite this notice, the County continued with election preparations.
