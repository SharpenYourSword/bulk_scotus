Martin.  Instead of simply denying those certiorari petitions on the ground that they lacked merit, the Court denied Martin leave to proceed <i>in forma pauperis</i> on the ground that the petitions were repetitive and frivolous.  <i>Zatko v. California,</i> 502 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 355, --- L.Ed.2d ----.  I dissented from that action, in part, because drawing distinctions between those petitions that are frivolous and those that are merely meritless is a wasteful use of this Court's resources.  The Court should simply deny certiorari once a determination is made that the petition lacks merit;  there is no reason for the Court to make an additional inquiry into whether the petition is frivolous and thus the motion for leave to proceed <i>in forma pauperis</i> should be denied instead.
