It is hardly surprising that he told his sentencing jury: \"You think I done it, gas me.\" 3 F. 3d 743, 746 (CA4 1993). Lawson's counsel, taking his cues from Lawson, neither investigated nor presented any evidence of his client's mental problems, which might have established statutory and nonstatutory mitigation, see N.

Stat. &#167; 15A-2000(f)(2) (1988) (\"The capital felony was committed while the defendant was under the influence of mental or emotional disturbance\"); &#167; 15A-2000(f)(6) (\"The capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired\"), which, in turn, might have meant the difference between life and death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lawson asserts in this habeas petition that his attorney's failure to investigate or to offer mental health mitigation constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.

To prevail on an ineffectiveness claim, a defendant must show \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" <i>Strickland</i> v. <i>Washington,</i> 466 U. S. 668, 694 (1984). The Court of Appeals upheld the denial of a hearing or relief on this claim because Lawson had \"failed to present clear and convincing evidence of positive and unequivocal facts which generate a substantial and legitimate doubt as to his mental capacity.\" 3 F. 3d, at 754.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a related claim, Lawson argues that, regardless of his personal wishes, the Constitution's twin requirements of rationality and individualized determinations command that his jury be presented mitigating evidence. See <i>Klokoc</i> v. <i>State,</i> 589 So. 2d 219, 220 (Fla. 1991); <i>State</i> v. <i>Koedatich,</i> 112 N. J. 225, 548 A. 2d 939 (1988), cert. denied, 488 U.

Finally, Lawson asserts that the instructions given his sentencing jury would lead a reasonable juror to understand that the jurors must reach unanimity on the existence of a mitigating factor before considering it, in violation of <i>Mills</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> 486 U.
