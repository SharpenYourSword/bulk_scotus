This is because the Supreme Court of New Mexico went beyond the permissible inquiry in an extradition case, and permitted the litigation of issues not open in the asylum State. The State's petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the New Mexico Supreme Court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   The motion of National Association of Extradition Officials for leave to file a brief as <i>amicus curiae</i> is granted.</p>\n\n</div>", "id": 118225, "judges": "Per Curiam", "local_path": null, "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/118225/", "sha1": "05f6c1d6292f89aeb4b434ef4c3372640ccc8283", "source": "LR", "supreme_court_db_id": "1997-082", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T10:20:27"}
