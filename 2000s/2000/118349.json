S. C. \u0e07 1125(a).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Respondent Samara Brothers, Inc., designs and manufactures children's clothing. Its primary product is a line of spring/summer one-piece seersucker outfits decorated with appliqu\u0e49s of hearts, flowers, fruits, and the like. A number of chain stores, including JCPenney, sell this line of clothing under contract with Samara.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., is one of the Nation's best known retailers, selling among other things children's clothing. In 1995, Wal-Mart contracted with one of its suppliers, Judy-Philippine, Inc., to manufacture a line of children's outfits for sale in the 1996 spring/summer season. Wal-Mart sent Judy-Philippine photographs of a number of garments from Samara's line, on which Judy-Philippine's garments were to be based; Judy-Philippine duly copied, with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*208</span> only minor modifications, 16 of Samara's garments, many of which contained copyrighted elements. In 1996, Wal-Mart briskly sold the so-called knockoffs, generating more than $1.15 million in gross profits.</p>\n<p>In June 1996, a buyer for JCPenney called a representative at Samara to complain that she had seen Samara garments on sale at Wal-Mart for a lower price than JCPenney was allowed to charge under its contract with Samara. The Samara representative told the buyer that Samara did not supply its clothing to Wal-Mart. Their suspicions aroused, however, Samara officials launched an investigation, which disclosed that Wal-Mart and several other major retailers\u0e42\u0080\u0094 Kmart, Caldor, Hills, and Goody's\u0e42\u0080\u0094were selling the knockoffs of Samara's outfits produced by Judy-Philippine.</p>\n<p>After sending cease-and-desist letters, Samara brought this action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Wal-Mart, Judy-Philippine, Kmart, Caldor, Hills, and Goody's for copyright infringement under federal law, consumer fraud and unfair competition under New York law, and\u0e42\u0080\u0094most relevant for our purposes\u0e42\u0080\u0094 infringement of unregistered trade dress under \u0e07 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1125(a). All of the defendants except Wal-Mart settled before trial.</p>\n<p>After a week long trial, the jury found in favor of Samara on all of its claims. Wal-Mart then renewed a motion for judgment as a matter of law, claiming, <i>inter alia,</i> that there was insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that Samara's clothing designs could be legally protected as distinctive trade dress for purposes of \u0e07 43(a). The District Court denied the motion, 969 F. Supp. 895 (SDNY 1997), and awarded Samara damages, interest, costs, and fees totaling almost $1.6 million, together with injunctive relief, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 56-58. The Second Circuit affirmed the denial of the motion for judgment as a matter of law, 165 F. 3d 120 (1998), and we granted certiorari, 528 U. S. 808 (1999).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*209</span> II</h2>\n<p>The Lanham Act provides for the registration of trademarks, which it defines in \u0e07 45 to include \"any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof [used or intended to be used] to identify and distinguish [a producer's] goods . . . from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods . . . .\" 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1127. Registration of a mark under \u0e07 2 of the Lanham Act, 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1052, enables the owner to sue an infringer under \u0e07 32, 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1114; it also entitles the owner to a presumption that its mark is valid, see \u0e07 7(b), 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1057(b), and ordinarily renders the registered mark incontestable after five years of continuous use, see \u0e07 15, 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1065. In addition to protecting registered marks, the Lanham Act, in \u0e07 43(a), gives a producer a cause of action for the use by any person of \"any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof . . . which . . . is likely to cause confusion . . . as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods . . . .\" 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1125(a). It is the latter provision that is at issue in this case.</p>\n<p>The breadth of the definition of marks registrable under \u0e07 2, and of the confusion-producing elements recited as actionable by \u0e07 43(a), has been held to embrace not just word marks, such as \"Nike,\" and symbol marks, such as Nike's \"swoosh\" symbol, but also \"trade dress\"\u0e42\u0080\u0094a category that originally included only the packaging, or \"dressing,\" of a product, but in recent years has been expanded by many Courts of Appeals to encompass the design of a product. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Ashley Furniture Industries, Inc.</i> v. <i>Sangiacomo N. A., Ltd.,</i> 187 F. 3d 363 (CA4 1999) (bedroom furniture); <i>Knitwaves, Inc.</i> v. <i>Lollytogs, Ltd.,</i> 71 F. 3d 996 (CA2 1995) (sweaters); <i>Stuart Hall Co., Inc.</i> v. <i>Ampad Corp.,</i> 51 F. 3d 780 (CA8 1995) (notebooks). These courts have assumed, often without discussion, that trade dress constitutes a \"symbol\" or \"device\" for purposes of the relevant sections, and we conclude likewise. \"Since human beings might use as a `symbol' <span class=\"star-pagination\">*210</span> or `device' almost anything at all that is capable of carrying meaning, this language, read literally, is not restrictive.\" <i>Qualitex Co.</i> v. <i>Jacobson Products Co.,</i> 514 U. S. 159, 162 (1995). This reading of \u0e07 2 and \u0e07 43(a) is buttressed by a recently added subsection of \u0e07 43(a), \u0e07 43(a)(3), which refers specifically to \"civil action[s] for trade dress infringement under this chapter for trade dress not registered on the principal register.\" 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1125(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p>The text of \u0e07 43(a) provides little guidance as to the circumstances under which unregistered trade dress may be protected. It does require that a producer show that the allegedly infringing feature is not \"functional,\" see \u0e07 43 (a)(3), and is likely to cause confusion with the product for which protection is sought, see \u0e07 43(a)(1)(A), 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1125(a)(1)(A). Nothing in \u0e07 43(a) explicitly requires a producer to show that its trade dress is distinctive, but courts have universally imposed that requirement, since without distinctiveness the trade dress would not \"cause confusion. . . as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of [the] goods,\" as the section requires. Distinctiveness is, moreover, an explicit prerequisite for registration of trade dress under \u0e07 2, and \"the general principles qualifying a mark for registration under \u0e07 2 of the Lanham Act are for the most part applicable in determining whether an unregistered mark is entitled to protection under \u0e07 43(a).\" <i>Two Pesos, Inc.</i>  v. <i>Taco Cabana, Inc.,</i> 505 U. S. 763, 768 (1992) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>In evaluating the distinctiveness of a mark under \u0e07 2 (and therefore, by analogy, under \u0e07 43(a)), courts have held that a mark can be distinctive in one of two ways. First, a mark is inherently distinctive if \"[its] intrinsic nature serves to identify a particular source.\" <i>Ibid.</i> In the context of word marks, courts have applied the now-classic test originally formulated by Judge Friendly, in which word marks that are \"arbitrary\" (\"Camel\" cigarettes), \"fanciful\" (\"Kodak\" film), or \"suggestive\" (\"Tide\" laundry detergent) are held to be inherently <span class=\"star-pagination\">*211</span> distinctive. See <i>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co.</i> v. <i>Hunting World, Inc.,</i> 537 F. 2d 4, 10-11 (CA2 1976). Second, a mark has acquired distinctiveness, even if it is not inherently distinctive, if it has developed secondary meaning, which occurs when, \"in the minds of the public, the primary significance of a [mark] is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself.\" <i>Inwood Laboratories, Inc.</i> v. <i>Ives Laboratories, Inc.,</i> 456 U. S. 844, 851, n. 11 (1982).<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p>The judicial differentiation between marks that are inherently distinctive and those that have developed secondary meaning has solid foundation in the statute itself. Section 2 requires that registration be granted to any trademark \"by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others\"\u0e42\u0080\u0094subject to various limited exceptions. 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1052. It also provides, again with limited exceptions, that \"nothing in this chapter shall prevent the registration of a mark used by the applicant which has become distinctive of the applicant's goods in commerce\"\u0e42\u0080\u0094that is, which is not inherently distinctive but has become so only through secondary meaning. \u0e07 2(f), 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1052(f). Nothing in \u0e07 2, however, demands the conclusion that <i>every</i>  category of mark necessarily includes some marks \"by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others\" <i>without</i> secondary meaning\u0e42\u0080\u0094that in every category some marks are inherently distinctive.</p>\n<p>Indeed, with respect to at least one category of mark\u0e42\u0080\u0094 colors\u0e42\u0080\u0094we have held that no mark can ever be inherently distinctive. See <i>Qualitex, supra,</i> at 162-163. In <i>Qualitex,</i>  <span class=\"star-pagination\">*212</span> petitioner manufactured and sold green-gold dry-cleaning press pads. After respondent began selling pads of a similar color, petitioner brought suit under \u0e07 43(a), then added a claim under \u0e07 32 after obtaining registration for the color of its pads. We held that a color could be protected as a trademark, but only upon a showing of secondary meaning. Reasoning by analogy to the <i>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</i> test developed for word marks, we noted that a product's color is unlike a \"fanciful,\" \"arbitrary,\" or \"suggestive\" mark, since it does not \"almost <i>automatically</i> tell a customer that [it] refer[s] to a brand,\" 514 U. S., at 162-163, and does not \"immediately . . . signal a brand or a product `source,'\" <i>id.,</i>  at 163. However, we noted that, \"over time, customers may come to treat a particular color on a product or its packaging . . . as signifying a brand.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Because a color, like a \"descriptive\" word mark, could eventually \"come to indicate a product's origin,\" we concluded that it could be protected <i>upon a showing of secondary meaning. Ibid.</i> </p>\n<p>It seems to us that design, like color, is not inherently distinctive. The attribution of inherent distinctiveness to certain categories of word marks and product packaging derives from the fact that the very purpose of attaching a particular word to a product, or encasing it in a distinctive packaging, is most often to identify the source of the product. Although the words and packaging can serve subsidiary functions\u0e42\u0080\u0094a suggestive word mark (such as \"Tide\" for laundry detergent), for instance, may invoke positive connotations in the consumer's mind, and a garish form of packaging (such as Tide's squat, brightly decorated plastic bottles for its liquid laundry detergent) may attract an otherwise indifferent consumer's attention on a crowded store shelf\u0e42\u0080\u0094their predominant function remains source identification. Consumers are therefore predisposed to regard those symbols as indication of the producer, which is why such symbols \"almost <i>automatically</i> tell a customer that they refer to a brand,\" <i>id.,</i> at 162-163, and \"immediately . . . signal a brand <span class=\"star-pagination\">*213</span> or a product `source,' \" <i>id.,</i> at 163. And where it is not reasonable to assume consumer predisposition to take an affixed word or packaging as indication of source\u0e42\u0080\u0094where, for example, the affixed word is descriptive of the product (\"Tasty\" bread) or of a geographic origin (\"Georgia\" peaches)\u0e42\u0080\u0094inherent distinctiveness will not be found. That is why the statute generally excludes, from those word marks that can be registered as inherently distinctive, words that are \"merely descriptive\" of the goods, \u0e07 2(e)(1), 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1052(e)(1), or \"primarily geographically descriptive of them,\" see \u0e07 2(e)(2), 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1052(e)(2). In the case of product design, as in the case of color, we think consumer predisposition to equate the feature with the source does not exist. Consumers are aware of the reality that, almost invariably, even the most unusual of product designs\u0e42\u0080\u0094such as a cocktail shaker shaped like a penguin\u0e42\u0080\u0094is intended not to identify the source, but to render the product itself more useful or more appealing.</p>\n<p>The fact that product design almost invariably serves purposes other than source identification not only renders inherent distinctiveness problematic; it also renders application of an inherent-distinctiveness principle more harmful to other consumer interests. Consumers should not be deprived of the benefits of competition with regard to the utilitarian and esthetic purposes that product design ordinarily serves by a rule of law that facilitates plausible threats of suit against new entrants based upon alleged inherent distinctiveness. How easy it is to mount a plausible suit depends, of course, upon the clarity of the test for inherent distinctiveness, and where product design is concerned we have little confidence that a reasonably clear test can be devised. Respondent and the United States as <i>amicus curiae</i> urge us to adopt for product design relevant portions of the test formulated by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals for product packaging in <i>Seabrook Foods, Inc.</i> v. <i>Bar-Well Foods, Ltd.,</i> 568 F. 2d 1342 (1977). That opinion, in determining the inherent distinctiveness of a product's packaging, considered, among <span class=\"star-pagination\">*214</span> other things, \"whether it was a `common' basic shape or design, whether it was unique or unusual in a particular field, [and] whether it was a mere refinement of a commonlyadopted and well-known form of ornamentation for a particular class of goods viewed by the public as a dress or ornamentation for the goods.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1344 (footnotes omitted). Such a test would rarely provide the basis for summary disposition of an anticompetitive strike suit. Indeed, at oral argument, counsel for the United States quite understandably would not give a definitive answer as to whether the test was met in this very case, saying only that \"[t]his is a very difficult case for that purpose.\" Tr.of Oral Arg. 19.</p>\n<p>It is true, of course, that the person seeking to exclude new entrants would have to establish the nonfunctionality of the design feature, see \u0e07 43(a)(3), 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1125(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V)\u0e42\u0080\u0094a showing that may involve consideration of its esthetic appeal, see <i>Qualitex, supra,</i> at 170. Competition is deterred, however, not merely by successful suit but by the plausible threat of successful suit, and given the unlikelihood of inherently source-identifying design, the game of allowing suit based upon alleged inherent distinctiveness seems to us not worth the candle. That is especially so since the producer can ordinarily obtain protection for a design that <i>is</i> inherently source identifying (if any such exists), but that does not yet have secondary meaning, by securing a design patent or a copyright for the design\u0e42\u0080\u0094as, indeed, respondent did for certain elements of the designs in this case. The availability of these other protections greatly reduces any harm to the producer that might ensue from our conclusion that a product design cannot be protected under \u0e07 43(a) without a showing of secondary meaning.</p>\n<p>Respondent contends that our decision in <i>Two Pesos</i> forecloses a conclusion that product-design trade dress can never be inherently distinctive. In that case, we held that the trade dress of a chain of Mexican restaurants, which the plaintiff described as \"a festive eating atmosphere having <span class=\"star-pagination\">*215</span> interior dining and patio areas decorated with artifacts, bright colors, paintings and murals,\" 505 U. S., at 765 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), could be protected under \u0e07 43(a) without a showing of secondary meaning, see <i>id.,</i> at 776. <i>Two Pesos</i> unquestionably establishes the legal principle that trade dress can be inherently distinctive, see, <i>e. g., id.,</i> at 773, but it does not establish that <i>product-design</i>  trade dress can be. <i>Two Pesos</i> is inapposite to our holding here because the trade dress at issue, the d\u0e49cor of a restaurant, seems to us not to constitute product <i>design.</i> It was either product packaging\u0e42\u0080\u0094which, as we have discussed, normally <i>is</i> taken by the consumer to indicate origin\u0e42\u0080\u0094or else some <i>tertium quid</i> that is akin to product packaging and has no bearing on the present case.</p>\n<p>Respondent replies that this manner of distinguishing <i>Two Pesos</i> will force courts to draw difficult lines between product-design and product-packaging trade dress. There will indeed be some hard cases at the margin: a classic glass Coca-Cola bottle, for instance, may constitute packaging for those consumers who drink the Coke and then discard the bottle, but may constitute the product itself for those consumers who are bottle collectors, or part of the product itself for those consumers who buy Coke in the classic glass bottle, rather than a can, because they think it more stylish to drink from the former. We believe, however, that the frequency and the difficulty of having to distinguish between product design and product packaging will be much less than the frequency and the difficulty of having to decide when a product design is inherently distinctive. To the extent there are close cases, we believe that courts should err on the side of caution and classify ambiguous trade dress as product design, thereby requiring secondary meaning. The very closeness will suggest the existence of relatively small utility in adopting an inherent-distinctiveness principle, and relatively great consumer benefit in requiring a demonstration of secondary meaning.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*216</span> * * *</h2>\n<p>We hold that, in an action for infringement of unregistered trade dress under \u0e07 43(a) of the Lanham Act, a product's design is distinctive, and therefore protectible, only upon a showing of secondary meaning.

It is often a misnomer in that context, since nonword marks ordinarily have no \"primary\" meaning. Clarity might well be served by using the term \"acquired meaning\" in both the wordmark and the nonword-mark contexts\u0e42\u0080\u0094but in this opinion we follow what has become the conventional terminology.</p>\n\n</div>",

The Second Circuit affirmed the denial of the motion for judgment as a matter of law, 165 F. 3d 120 (1998), and we granted certiorari, 528 U. S. 808 (1999).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*209</span> II</h2>\n<p>The Lanham Act provides for the registration of trademarks, which it defines in \u0e07 45 to include \"any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof [used or intended to be used] to identify and distinguish [a producer's] goods . . . from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods . . . .\" 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1127. Registration of a mark under \u0e07 2 of the Lanham Act, 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1052, enables the owner to sue an infringer under \u0e07 32, 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1114; it also entitles the owner to a presumption that its mark is valid, see \u0e07 7(b), 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1057(b), and ordinarily renders the registered mark incontestable after five years of continuous use, see \u0e07 15, 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1065. In addition to protecting registered marks, the Lanham Act, in \u0e07 43(a), gives a producer a cause of action for the use by any person of \"any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof . . . which . . . is likely to cause confusion . . . as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods . . . .\" 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1125(a). It is the latter provision that is at issue in this case.</p>\n<p>The breadth of the definition of marks registrable under \u0e07 2, and of the confusion-producing elements recited as actionable by \u0e07 43(a), has been held to embrace not just word marks, such as \"Nike,\" and symbol marks, such as Nike's \"swoosh\" symbol, but also \"trade dress\"\u0e42\u0080\u0094a category that originally included only the packaging, or \"dressing,\" of a product, but in recent years has been expanded by many Courts of Appeals to encompass the design of a product. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Ashley Furniture Industries, Inc.</i> v. <i>Sangiacomo N. A., Ltd.,</i> 187 F. 3d 363 (CA4 1999) (bedroom furniture); <i>Knitwaves, Inc.</i> v. <i>Lollytogs, Ltd.,</i> 71 F. 3d 996 (CA2 1995) (sweaters); <i>Stuart Hall Co., Inc.</i> v. <i>Ampad Corp.,</i> 51 F. 3d 780 (CA8 1995) (notebooks). These courts have assumed, often without discussion, that trade dress constitutes a \"symbol\" or \"device\" for purposes of the relevant sections, and we conclude likewise. \"Since human beings might use as a `symbol' <span class=\"star-pagination\">*210</span> or `device' almost anything at all that is capable of carrying meaning, this language, read literally, is not restrictive.\" <i>Qualitex Co.</i> v. <i>Jacobson Products Co.,</i> 514 U. S. 159, 162 (1995). This reading of \u0e07 2 and \u0e07 43(a) is buttressed by a recently added subsection of \u0e07 43(a), \u0e07 43(a)(3), which refers specifically to \"civil action[s] for trade dress infringement under this chapter for trade dress not registered on the principal register.\" 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1125(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p>The text of \u0e07 43(a) provides little guidance as to the circumstances under which unregistered trade dress may be protected. It does require that a producer show that the allegedly infringing feature is not \"functional,\" see \u0e07 43 (a)(3), and is likely to cause confusion with the product for which protection is sought, see \u0e07 43(a)(1)(A), 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1125(a)(1)(A). Nothing in \u0e07 43(a) explicitly requires a producer to show that its trade dress is distinctive, but courts have universally imposed that requirement, since without distinctiveness the trade dress would not \"cause confusion. . . as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of [the] goods,\" as the section requires. Distinctiveness is, moreover, an explicit prerequisite for registration of trade dress under \u0e07 2, and \"the general principles qualifying a mark for registration under \u0e07 2 of the Lanham Act are for the most part applicable in determining whether an unregistered mark is entitled to protection under \u0e07 43(a).\" <i>Two Pesos, Inc.</i>  v. <i>Taco Cabana, Inc.,</i> 505 U. S. 763, 768 (1992) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>In evaluating the distinctiveness of a mark under \u0e07 2 (and therefore, by analogy, under \u0e07 43(a)), courts have held that a mark can be distinctive in one of two ways. First, a mark is inherently distinctive if \"[its] intrinsic nature serves to identify a particular source.\" <i>Ibid.</i> In the context of word marks, courts have applied the now-classic test originally formulated by Judge Friendly, in which word marks that are \"arbitrary\" (\"Camel\" cigarettes), \"fanciful\" (\"Kodak\" film), or \"suggestive\" (\"Tide\" laundry detergent) are held to be inherently <span class=\"star-pagination\">*211</span> distinctive. See <i>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co.</i> v. <i>Hunting World, Inc.,</i> 537 F. 2d 4, 10-11 (CA2 1976). Second, a mark has acquired distinctiveness, even if it is not inherently distinctive, if it has developed secondary meaning, which occurs when, \"in the minds of the public, the primary significance of a [mark] is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself.\" <i>Inwood Laboratories, Inc.</i> v. <i>Ives Laboratories, Inc.,</i> 456 U. S. 844, 851, n. 11 (1982).<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p>The judicial differentiation between marks that are inherently distinctive and those that have developed secondary meaning has solid foundation in the statute itself. Section 2 requires that registration be granted to any trademark \"by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others\"\u0e42\u0080\u0094subject to various limited exceptions. 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1052. It also provides, again with limited exceptions, that \"nothing in this chapter shall prevent the registration of a mark used by the applicant which has become distinctive of the applicant's goods in commerce\"\u0e42\u0080\u0094that is, which is not inherently distinctive but has become so only through secondary meaning. \u0e07 2(f), 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1052(f). Nothing in \u0e07 2, however, demands the conclusion that <i>every</i>  category of mark necessarily includes some marks \"by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others\" <i>without</i> secondary meaning\u0e42\u0080\u0094that in every category some marks are inherently distinctive.</p>\n<p>Indeed, with respect to at least one category of mark\u0e42\u0080\u0094 colors\u0e42\u0080\u0094we have held that no mark can ever be inherently distinctive. See <i>Qualitex, supra,</i> at 162-163. In <i>Qualitex,</i>  <span class=\"star-pagination\">*212</span> petitioner manufactured and sold green-gold dry-cleaning press pads. After respondent began selling pads of a similar color, petitioner brought suit under \u0e07 43(a), then added a claim under \u0e07 32 after obtaining registration for the color of its pads. We held that a color could be protected as a trademark, but only upon a showing of secondary meaning. Reasoning by analogy to the <i>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</i> test developed for word marks, we noted that a product's color is unlike a \"fanciful,\" \"arbitrary,\" or \"suggestive\" mark, since it does not \"almost <i>automatically</i> tell a customer that [it] refer[s] to a brand,\" 514 U. S., at 162-163, and does not \"immediately . . . signal a brand or a product `source,'\" <i>id.,</i>  at 163. However, we noted that, \"over time, customers may come to treat a particular color on a product or its packaging . . . as signifying a brand.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Because a color, like a \"descriptive\" word mark, could eventually \"come to indicate a product's origin,\" we concluded that it could be protected <i>upon a showing of secondary meaning. Ibid.</i> </p>\n<p>It seems to us that design, like color, is not inherently distinctive. The attribution of inherent distinctiveness to certain categories of word marks and product packaging derives from the fact that the very purpose of attaching a particular word to a product, or encasing it in a distinctive packaging, is most often to identify the source of the product. Although the words and packaging can serve subsidiary functions\u0e42\u0080\u0094a suggestive word mark (such as \"Tide\" for laundry detergent), for instance, may invoke positive connotations in the consumer's mind, and a garish form of packaging (such as Tide's squat, brightly decorated plastic bottles for its liquid laundry detergent) may attract an otherwise indifferent consumer's attention on a crowded store shelf\u0e42\u0080\u0094their predominant function remains source identification. Consumers are therefore predisposed to regard those symbols as indication of the producer, which is why such symbols \"almost <i>automatically</i> tell a customer that they refer to a brand,\" <i>id.,</i> at 162-163, and \"immediately . . . signal a brand <span class=\"star-pagination\">*213</span> or a product `source,' \" <i>id.,</i> at 163. And where it is not reasonable to assume consumer predisposition to take an affixed word or packaging as indication of source\u0e42\u0080\u0094where, for example, the affixed word is descriptive of the product (\"Tasty\" bread) or of a geographic origin (\"Georgia\" peaches)\u0e42\u0080\u0094inherent distinctiveness will not be found. That is why the statute generally excludes, from those word marks that can be registered as inherently distinctive, words that are \"merely descriptive\" of the goods, \u0e07 2(e)(1), 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1052(e)(1), or \"primarily geographically descriptive of them,\" see \u0e07 2(e)(2), 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1052(e)(2). In the case of product design, as in the case of color, we think consumer predisposition to equate the feature with the source does not exist. Consumers are aware of the reality that, almost invariably, even the most unusual of product designs\u0e42\u0080\u0094such as a cocktail shaker shaped like a penguin\u0e42\u0080\u0094is intended not to identify the source, but to render the product itself more useful or more appealing.</p>\n<p>The fact that product design almost invariably serves purposes other than source identification not only renders inherent distinctiveness problematic; it also renders application of an inherent-distinctiveness principle more harmful to other consumer interests. Consumers should not be deprived of the benefits of competition with regard to the utilitarian and esthetic purposes that product design ordinarily serves by a rule of law that facilitates plausible threats of suit against new entrants based upon alleged inherent distinctiveness. How easy it is to mount a plausible suit depends, of course, upon the clarity of the test for inherent distinctiveness, and where product design is concerned we have little confidence that a reasonably clear test can be devised. Respondent and the United States as <i>amicus curiae</i> urge us to adopt for product design relevant portions of the test formulated by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals for product packaging in <i>Seabrook Foods, Inc.</i> v. <i>Bar-Well Foods, Ltd.,</i> 568 F. 2d 1342 (1977). That opinion, in determining the inherent distinctiveness of a product's packaging, considered, among <span class=\"star-pagination\">*214</span> other things, \"whether it was a `common' basic shape or design, whether it was unique or unusual in a particular field, [and] whether it was a mere refinement of a commonlyadopted and well-known form of ornamentation for a particular class of goods viewed by the public as a dress or ornamentation for the goods.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1344 (footnotes omitted). Such a test would rarely provide the basis for summary disposition of an anticompetitive strike suit. Indeed, at oral argument, counsel for the United States quite understandably would not give a definitive answer as to whether the test was met in this very case, saying only that \"[t]his is a very difficult case for that purpose.\" Tr.of Oral Arg. 19.</p>\n<p>It is true, of course, that the person seeking to exclude new entrants would have to establish the nonfunctionality of the design feature, see \u0e07 43(a)(3), 15 U. S. C. \u0e07 1125(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V)\u0e42\u0080\u0094a showing that may involve consideration of its esthetic appeal, see <i>Qualitex, supra,</i> at 170. Competition is deterred, however, not merely by successful suit but by the plausible threat of successful suit, and given the unlikelihood of inherently source-identifying design, the game of allowing suit based upon alleged inherent distinctiveness seems to us not worth the candle. That is especially so since the producer can ordinarily obtain protection for a design that <i>is</i> inherently source identifying (if any such exists), but that does not yet have secondary meaning, by securing a design patent or a copyright for the design\u0e42\u0080\u0094as, indeed, respondent did for certain elements of the designs in this case. The availability of these other protections greatly reduces any harm to the producer that might ensue from our conclusion that a product design cannot be protected under \u0e07 43(a) without a showing of secondary meaning.</p>\n<p>Respondent contends that our decision in <i>Two Pesos</i> forecloses a conclusion that product-design trade dress can never be inherently distinctive. In that case, we held that the trade dress of a chain of Mexican restaurants, which the plaintiff described as \"a festive eating atmosphere having <span class=\"star-pagination\">*215</span> interior dining and patio areas decorated with artifacts, bright colors, paintings and murals,\" 505 U. S., at 765 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), could be protected under \u0e07 43(a) without a showing of secondary meaning, see <i>id.,</i> at 776. <i>Two Pesos</i> unquestionably establishes the legal principle that trade dress can be inherently distinctive, see, <i>e. g., id.,</i> at 773, but it does not establish that <i>product-design</i>  trade dress can be. <i>Two Pesos</i> is inapposite to our holding here because the trade dress at issue, the d\u0e49cor of a restaurant, seems to us not to constitute product <i>design.</i> It was either product packaging\u0e42\u0080\u0094which, as we have discussed, normally <i>is</i> taken by the consumer to indicate origin\u0e42\u0080\u0094or else some <i>tertium quid</i> that is akin to product packaging and has no bearing on the present case.</p>\n<p>Respondent replies that this manner of distinguishing <i>Two Pesos</i> will force courts to draw difficult lines between product-design and product-packaging trade dress. There will indeed be some hard cases at the margin: a classic glass Coca-Cola bottle, for instance, may constitute packaging for those consumers who drink the Coke and then discard the bottle, but may constitute the product itself for those consumers who are bottle collectors, or part of the product itself for those consumers who buy Coke in the classic glass bottle, rather than a can, because they think it more stylish to drink from the former. We believe, however, that the frequency and the difficulty of having to distinguish between product design and product packaging will be much less than the frequency and the difficulty of having to decide when a product design is inherently distinctive. To the extent there are close cases, we believe that courts should err on the side of caution and classify ambiguous trade dress as product design, thereby requiring secondary meaning. The very closeness will suggest the existence of relatively small utility in adopting an inherent-distinctiveness principle, and relatively great consumer benefit in requiring a demonstration of secondary meaning.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*216</span> * * *</h2>\n<p>We hold that, in an action for infringement of unregistered trade dress under \u0e07 43(a) of the Lanham Act, a product's design is distinctive, and therefore protectible, only upon a showing of secondary meaning.

It is often a misnomer in that context, since nonword marks ordinarily have no \"primary\" meaning. Clarity might well be served by using the term \"acquired meaning\" in both the wordmark and the nonword-mark contexts\u0e42\u0080\u0094but in this opinion we follow what has become the conventional terminology.</p>\n\n</div>",

Petitioner Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., contracted with a supplier to  manufacture outfits based on photographs of Samara garments. After discovering  that Wal-Mart and other retailers were selling the so-called knockoffs, Samara  brought this action for, inter alia , infringement of unregistered trade dress  under 43(a) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act). The jury found for  Samara. Wal-Mart then renewed a motion for judgment as a matter of law, claiming  that there was insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that Samara's  clothing designs could be legally protected as distinctive trade dress for  purposes of 43(a). The District Court denied the motion and awarded Samara  relief. The Second Circuit affirmed the denial of the motion.</p>\n      <p>Held : In a 43(a) action for infringement of unregistered trade dress, a  product's design is distinctive, and therefore protectible, only upon a showing  of secondary meaning. Pp. 3-10.</p>\n      <p>(a) In addition to protecting registered trademarks, the Lanham Act, in  43(a), gives a producer a cause of action for the use by any person of \"any ...  symbo[l] or device ... likely to cause confusion ... as to the origin ... of his  or her goods.\" The breadth of the confusion-producing elements actionable under  43(a) has been held to embrace not just word marks and symbol marks, but also  \"trade dress\"--a category that originally included only the packaging, or  \"dressing,\" of a product, but in recent years has been expanded by many courts  of appeals to encompass the product's design. These courts have correctly  assumed that trade dress constitutes a \"symbol\" or \"device\" for Lanham Act  purposes. Although 43(a) does not explicitly require a producer to show that  its trade dress is distinctive, courts have universally imposed that  requirement, since without distinctiveness the trade dress would not \"cause  confusion ... as to ... origin,\" as 43(a) requires. In evaluating  distinctiveness, courts have differentiated between marks that are inherently  distinctive-- i.e. , marks whose intrinsic nature serves to identify their  particular source--and marks that have acquired distinctiveness through  secondary meaning-- i.e. , marks whose primary significance, in the minds of the  public, is to identify the product's source rather than the product itself. This  Court has held, however, that applications of at least one category of  mark--color--can never be inherently distinctive, although they can be protected  upon a showing of secondary meaning. Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., 514  U. S. 159 , 162-163. Pp. 3-6.</p>\n      <p>(b) Design, like color, is not inherently distinctive. The attribution of  inherent distinctiveness to certain categories of word marks and product  packaging derives from the fact that the very purpose of attaching a particular  word to a product, or encasing it in a distinctive package, is most often to  identify the product's source. Where it is not reasonable to assume consumer  predisposition to take an affixed word or packaging as indication of source,  inherent distinctiveness will not be found. With product design, as with color,  consumers are aware of the reality that, almost invariably, that feature is  intended not to identify the source, but to render the product itself more  useful or more appealing. Pp. 6-9.</p>\n      <p>(c) Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U. S. 763 , does not  foreclose the Court's conclusion, since the trade dress there at issue was  restaurant deor, which does not constitute product design, but rather product  packaging or else some tertium quid that is akin to product packaging and has no  bearing on the present case. While distinguishing Two Pesos might force courts  to draw difficult lines between product-design and product-packaging trade  dress, the frequency and difficulty of having to distinguish between the two  will be much less than the frequency and difficulty of having to decide when a  product design is inherently distinctive. To the extent there are close cases,  courts should err on the side of caution and classify ambiguous trade dress as  product design, thereby requiring secondary meaning.

It is the latter provision that is at issue in this  case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>The breadth of the definition of marks registrable under 2, and of the  confusion-producing elements recited as actionable by 43(a), has been held to  embrace not just word marks, such as \"Nike,\" and symbol marks, such as Nike's  \"swoosh\" symbol, but also \"trade dress\"--a category that originally included  only the packaging, or \"dressing,\" of a product, but in recent years has been  expanded by many courts of appeals to encompass the design of a product. See,  e.g. , Ashley Furniture Industries, Inc. v. Sangiacomo N. A., Ltd. , 187 F. 3d  363 (CA4 1999) (bedroom furniture); Knitwaves, Inc. v. Lollytogs, Ltd. , 71 F.  3d 996 (CA2 1995) (sweaters); Stuart Hall Co., Inc. v. Ampad Corp. , 51 F. 3d  780 (CA8 1995) (notebooks). These courts have assumed, often without discussion,  that trade dress constitutes a \"symbol\" or \"device\" for purposes of the relevant  sections, and we conclude likewise. \"Since human beings might use as a `symbol'  or `device' almost anything at all that is capable of carrying meaning, this  language, read literally, is not restrictive.\" Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products  Co., 514 U. S. 159, 162 (1995). This reading of 2 and 43(a) is buttressed by a  recently added subsection of 43(a), 43(a)(3), which refers specifically to  \"civil action[s] for trade dress infringement under this chapter for trade dress  not registered on the principal register.\" 15 U. S. C. A. 1125(a)(3) (Oct. 1999  Supp.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>The text of 43(a) provides little guidance as to the circumstances under  which unregistered trade dress may be protected. It does require that a producer  show that the allegedly infringing feature is not \"functional,\" see 43(a)(3),  and is likely to cause confusion with the product for which protection is  sought, see 43(a)(1)(A), 15 U. S. C.. 1125(a)(1)(A). Nothing in 43(a)  explicitly requires a producer to show that its trade dress is distinctive, but  courts have universally imposed that requirement, since without distinctiveness  the trade dress would not \"cause confusion . . . as to the origin, sponsorship,  or approval of [the] goods,\" as the section requires. Distinctiveness is,  moreover, an explicit prerequisite for registration of trade dress under 2, and  \"the general principles qualifying a mark for registration under 2 of the  Lanham Act are for the most part applicable in determining whether an  unregistered mark is entitled to protection under 43(a).\" Two Pesos, Inc. v.  Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U. S. 763, 768 (1992) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>In evaluating the distinctiveness of a mark under 2 (and therefore, by  analogy, under 43(a)), courts have held that a mark can be distinctive in one  of two ways. First, a mark is inherently distinctive if \"[its] intrinsic nature  serves to identify a particular source.\" Ibid . In the context of word marks,  courts have applied the now-classic test originally formulated by Judge  Friendly, in which word marks that are \"arbitrary\" (\"Camel\" cigarettes),  \"fanciful\" (\"Kodak\" film), or \"suggestive\" (\"Tide\" laundry detergent) are held  to be inherently distinctive. See Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc.  , 537 F. 2d 4, 10-11 (CA2 1976). Second, a mark has acquired distinctiveness,  even if it is not inherently distinctive, if it has developed secondary meaning,  which occurs when, \"in the minds of the public, the primary significance of a  [mark] is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself.\"  Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc. , 456 U. S. 844, 851 , n.  11 (1982).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>The judicial differentiation between marks that are inherently distinctive  and those that have developed secondary meaning has solid foundation in the  statute itself. Section 2 requires that registration be granted to any trademark  \"by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of  others\"--subject to various limited exceptions. 15 U. S. C. 1052. It also  provides, again with limited exceptions, that \"nothing in this chapter shall  prevent the registration of a mark used by the applicant which has become  distinctive of the applicant's goods in commerce\"--that is, which is not  inherently distinctive but has become so only through secondary meaning. 2(f),  15 U. S. C. 1052(f). Nothing in 2, however, demands the conclusion that every  category of mark necessarily includes some marks \"by which the goods of the  applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others\" without secondary  meaning--that in every category some marks are inherently distinctive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>Indeed, with respect to at least one category of mark--colors--we have held  that no mark can ever be inherently distinctive. See Qualitex , 514 U. S. , at  162 -163. In Qualitex , petitioner manufactured and sold green-gold dry-cleaning  press pads. After respondent began selling pads of a similar color, petitioner  brought suit under 43(a), then added a claim under 32 after obtaining  registration for the color of its pads. We held that a color could be protected  as a trademark, but only upon a showing of secondary meaning. Reasoning by  analogy to the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch test developed for word marks, we noted that  a product's color is unlike a \"fanciful,\" \"arbitrary,\" or \"suggestive\" mark,  since it does not \"almost automatically tell a customer that [it] refer[s] to a  brand,\" ibid ., and does not \"immediately ... signal a brand or a product  `source,' \" id ., at 163. However, we noted that, \"over time, customers may come  to treat a particular color on a product or its packaging ... as signifying a  brand.\" Id ., at 162-163. Because a color, like a \"descriptive\" word mark, could  eventually \"come to indicate a product's origin,\" we concluded that it could be  protected upon a showing of secondary meaning . Ibid .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>It seems to us that design, like color, is not inherently distinctive. The  attribution of inherent distinctiveness to certain categories of word marks and  product packaging derives from the fact that the very purpose of attaching a  particular word to a product, or encasing it in a distinctive packaging, is most  often to identify the source of the product. Although the words and packaging  can serve subsidiary functions--a suggestive word mark (such as \"Tide\" for  laundry detergent), for instance, may invoke positive connotations in the  consumer's mind, and a garish form of packaging (such as Tide's squat, brightly  decorated plastic bottles for its liquid laundry detergent) may attract an  otherwise indifferent consumer's attention on a crowded store shelf--their  predominant function remains source identification. Consumers are therefore  predisposed to regard those symbols as indication of the producer, which is why  such symbols \"almost automatically tell a customer that they refer to a brand,\"  id ., at 162-163, and \"immediately ... signal a brand or a product `source,' \"  id ., at 163. And where it is not reasonable to assume consumer predisposition  to take an affixed word or packaging as indication of source--where, for  example, the affixed word is descriptive of the product (\"Tasty\" bread) or of a  geographic origin (\"Georgia\" peaches)--inherent distinctiveness will not be  found. That is why the statute generally excludes, from those word marks that  can be registered as inherently distinctive, words that are \"merely descriptive\"  of the goods, 2(e)(1), 15 U. S. C. 1052(e)(1), or \"primarily geographically  descriptive of them,\" see 2(e)(2), 15 U. S. C. 1052(e)(2). In the case of  product design, as in the case of color, we think consumer predisposition to  equate the feature with the source does not exist. Consumers are aware of the  reality that, almost invariably, even the most unusual of product designs--such  as a cocktail shaker shaped like a penguin--is intended not to identify the  source, but to render the product itself more useful or more appealing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>The fact that product design almost invariably serves purposes other than  source identification not only renders inherent distinctiveness problematic; it  also renders application of an inherent-distinctiveness principle more harmful  to other consumer interests. Consumers should not be deprived of the benefits of  competition with regard to the utilitarian and esthetic purposes that product  design ordinarily serves by a rule of law that facilitates plausible threats of  suit against new entrants based upon alleged inherent distinctiveness. How easy  it is to mount a plausible suit depends, of course, upon the clarity of the test  for inherent distinctiveness, and where product design is concerned we have  little confidence that a reasonably clear test can be devised. Respondent and  the United States as amicus curiae urge us to adopt for product design relevant  portions of the test formulated by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals for  product packaging in Seabrook Foods, Inc. v. Bar-Well Foods, Ltd. , 568 F. 2d  1342 (1977). That opinion, in determining the inherent distinctiveness of a  product's packaging, considered, among other things, \"whether it was a `common'  basic shape or design, whether it was unique or unusual in a particular field,  [and] whether it was a mere refinement of a commonly-adopted and well-known form  of ornamentation for a particular class of goods viewed by the public as a dress  or ornamentation for the goods.\" Id ., at 1344 (footnotes omitted). Such a test  would rarely provide the basis for summary disposition of an anticompetitive  strike suit. Indeed, at oral argument, counsel for the United States quite  understandably would not give a definitive answer as to whether the test was met  in this very case, saying only that \"[t]his is a very difficult case for that  purpose.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>It is true, of course, that the person seeking to exclude new entrants  would have to establish the nonfunctionality of the design feature, see  43(a)(3), 15 U. S. C. A. 1125(a)(3) (Oct. 1999 Supp.)--a showing that may  involve consideration of its esthetic appeal, see Qualitex , 514 U. S., at 170 .  Competition is deterred, however, not merely by successful suit but by the  plausible threat of successful suit, and given the unlikelihood of inherently  source-identifying design, the game of allowing suit based upon alleged inherent  distinctiveness seems to us not worth the candle. That is especially so since  the producer can ordinarily obtain protection for a design that is inherently  source identifying (if any such exists), but that does not yet have secondary  meaning, by securing a design patent or a copyright for the design--as, indeed,  respondent did for certain elements of the designs in this case. The  availability of these other protections greatly reduces any harm to the producer  that might ensue from our conclusion that a product design cannot be protected  under 43(a) without a showing of secondary meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>Respondent contends that our decision in Two Pesos forecloses a conclusion  that product-design trade dress can never be inherently distinctive. In that  case, we held that the trade dress of a chain of Mexican restaurants, which the  plaintiff described as \"a festive eating atmosphere having interior dining and  patio areas decorated with artifacts, bright colors, paintings and murals,\" 505  U. S., at 765 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), could be  protected under 43(a) without a showing of secondary meaning, see id ., at 776.  Two Pesos unquestionably establishes the legal principle that trade dress can be  inherently distinctive, see, e.g. , id ., at 773, but it does not establish that  product-design trade dress can be. Two Pesos is inapposite to our holding here  because the trade dress at issue, the decor of a restaurant, seems to us not to  constitute product design . It was either product packaging--which, as we have  discussed, normally is taken by the consumer to indicate origin--or else some  tertium quid that is akin to product packaging and has no bearing on the present  case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>Respondent replies that this manner of distinguishing Two Pesos will force  courts to draw difficult lines between product-design and product-packaging  trade dress. There will indeed be some hard cases at the margin: a classic glass  Coca-Cola bottle, for instance, may constitute packaging for those consumers who  drink the Coke and then discard the bottle, but may constitute the product  itself for those consumers who are bottle collectors, or part of the product  itself for those consumers who buy Coke in the classic glass bottle, rather than  a can, because they think it more stylish to drink from the former. We believe,  however, that the frequency and the difficulty of having to distinguish between  product design and product packaging will be much less than the frequency and  the difficulty of having to decide when a product design is inherently  distinctive. To the extent there are close cases, we believe that courts should  err on the side of caution and classify ambiguous trade dress as product design,  thereby requiring secondary meaning. The very closeness will suggest the  existence of relatively small utility in adopting an inherent-distinctiveness  principle, and relatively great consumer benefit in requiring a demonstration of  secondary meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>We hold that, in an action for infringement of unregistered trade dress  under 43(a) of the Lanham Act, a product's design is distinctive, and therefore  protectible, only upon a showing of secondary meaning. The judgment of the  Second Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings  consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  The phrase \"secondary meaning\" originally arose in the context of word marks,  where it served to distinguish the source-identifying meaning from the ordinary,  or \"primary,\" meaning of the word. \"Secondary meaning\" has since come to refer  to the acquired, source-identifying meaning of a non-word mark as well. It is  often a misnomer in that context, since non-word marks ordinarily have no \"pri-  mary\" meaning. Clarity might well be served by using the term  \"acquired meaning\" in both the word-mark and the non-word-mark contexts--but in  this opinion we follow what has become the conventional terminology.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
