When the Inyo County District Attorney asked the Casino for the employment records of three Casino employees under investigation for welfare fraud, the Tribe responded that its privacy policy precluded release of the records without the employees' consent. The District Attorney, on showing probable cause, then obtained and executed a search warrant authorizing a search of the Casino for payroll records of the three employees. The District Attorney subsequently asked for the records of six other Casino employees. The Tribe reiterated its privacy policy, but offered to accept as evidence of consent a redacted copy of the last page of each employee's signed welfare application. The District Attorney refused the offer. To ward off any additional searches, the Tribe and its Gaming Corporation filed suit in Federal District Court against the District Attorney and the Sheriff, in their individual and official capacities, and the County. Asserting federalquestion jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. &#167;&#167;1331, 1337, 1343(i)(3)(4), and the federal common law of Indian affairs, the Tribe sought injunctive and declaratory relief to vindicate its status as a sovereign immune from state processes under federal law, and to establish that state law was preempted to the extent that it purported to authorize seizure of tribal records. The Tribe also sought relief under 42 U. S. C. &#167;1983, including compensatory damages, alleging that the defendants violated the Tribe's and Gaming Corporation's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and the Tribe's right to selfgovernment. The District Court, on defendants' motion, dismissed the Tribe's complaint, holding, <i>inter alia,</i> that tribal sovereign immunity did not categorically preclude the search and seizure of the Casino's personnel records. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that execution of a search warrant against the Tribe interfered with \"the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.\" <i>Williams</i> v. <i>Lee,</i> 358 U. S. 217, 220 (1959). Acknowledging a prior decision in which it held that the right to tribal self-government is not protected by &#167;1983, the court concluded that, in this case, a &#167;1983 claim could be maintained because the Tribe sought protection from an unlawful search and seizure, a right secured by the Fourth Amendment and therefore within &#167;1983's compass.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Held:</i>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The Tribe may not sue under &#167;1983 to vindicate the sovereign right it here claims. Section 1983 permits \"citizen[s]\" and \"other person[ s] within the jurisdiction\" of the United States to seek legal and equitable relief from \"person[s]\" who, under color of state law, deprive them of federally protected rights. Although this case does not squarely present the question, the Court assumes that tribes, like States, are not subject to suit under &#167;1983. See <i>Michigan Dept. of State</i> v. <i>Will,</i> 491 U. S. 58. The issue pivotal here is whether a tribe qualifies <i>as a claimant</i>&#8212;a \"person within the jurisdiction\" of the United States&#8212;under &#167;1983. Qualification of a sovereign as a \"person\" who may maintain a particular claim for relief depends not \"upon a bare analysis of the word `person,'\" <i>Pfizer Inc.</i> v. <i>Government of India,</i> 434 U. S. 308, 317, but on the \"legislative environment\" in which the word appears, <i>Georgia</i> v. <i>Evans,</i> 316 U. S. 159, 161. There is in this case no allegation that the County lacked probable cause or that the warrant was otherwise defective. It is only by virtue of the Tribe's asserted \"sovereign\" status that it claims immunity from the County's processes. Section 1983 was designed to secure private rights against government encroachment, see <i>Will,</i> 491 U. S., at 66, not to advance a sovereign's prerogative to withhold evidence relevant to a criminal investigation. For example, a tribal member complaining of a Fourth Amendment violation would be a \"person\" qualified to sue under &#167;1983. But, like other persons, that member would have no immunity from an appropriately executed search warrant based on probable cause. The Tribe, accordingly, may not sue under &#167;1983 to vindicate the sovereign right it here claims. Pp. 6-10.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Tribe has not explained, and the trial and appellate courts have not clearly decided, what prescription of federal common law, if any, enables the Tribe to maintain an action for declaratory and injunctive relief establishing its sovereign right to be free from state criminal processes. This case is therefore remanded for focused consideration and resolution of that jurisdictional question.

Pursuing the investigation, county law-enforcement officers executed a state court warrant for casino employment records kept by the Tribe on its reservation. The Tribe sued the County, the District Attorney, and the Sheriff in federal court, asserting sovereign immunity from state court processes and seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties and, as <i>amicus curiae,</i> the United States agree that a Native American Tribe, like a State of the United States, is not a \"person\" subject to suit under 42 U. S. C. &#167;1983. We hold that, in the situation here presented, the Tribe does not qualify as a \"person\" who may sue under &#167;1983. Whether the Tribe's suit qualifies for federal-court jurisdiction because it arises under some federal law other than &#167;1983 is an issue the parties have not precisely addressed, and the trial and appellate courts have not clearly decided.

According to the County, the employees failed to respond when the Department requested that they reconcile the apparent discrepancies between their Casino earnings and their welfare application forms. <i>Id.,</i> at 5. The Department then forwarded the matter to the Inyo County District Attorney's Office, which, in turn, asked the employees to reconcile the apparent discrepancies. <i>Id.,</i> at 6.

The warrant authorized a search of the Casino for payroll records of the three employees. On March 23, 2000, the Inyo County Sheriff and the District Attorney executed the warrant. They did so over the objection of tribal officials. Those officials urged that the state court lacked jurisdiction to authorize a search of premises and seizure of records belonging to a sovereign tribe.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The Sheriff and the District Attorney, lacking cooperation from the Tribe, cut the locks off the storage facility containing the Casino's personnel records. The county officials seized timecard entries, payroll registers, and payroll check registers relating to the three employees; the seizure also garnered information contained in quarterly wage and withholding reports the Corporation had submitted to the State.

Asserting federal question jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. &#167;&#167;1331, 1337, 1343(i)(3)(4), and the \"federal common law of Indian affairs,\" the Tribe sought injunctive and declaratory relief to vindicate its status as a sovereign immune from state processes under federal law, and to establish that state law was preempted to the extent that it purported to authorize seizure of tribal records. App. 97, &#182;1, 105-114, &#182;&#182;26-53. The Tribe's complaint also sought relief under 42 U. S. C. &#167;1983, including compensatory damages. In this regard, the Tribe alleged that by acting beyond the scope of their jurisdiction and \"without authorization of law\" in executing the warrant,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the defendants violated the Tribe's and Corporation's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments rights, and the Tribe's right to self-government.

Tribal sovereign immunity, the court held, did not categorically preclude the search and seizure of the Casino's personnel records. Taking into account the competing interests of the State and the Tribe, the court concluded that, \"[i]n the interest of a fair and uniform application of California's criminal law, state officials should be able to execute search warrant[s] against the tribe and tribal property.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a.

S. 217, 220 (1959)). In the appellate court's view, the District Court should not have \"balanced the interests at stake\" to determine whether the warrant was enforceable. 291 F. 3d, at 559. This Court's precedent, the Ninth Circuit said, advanced \"a more categorical approach denying state jurisdiction . . . over a tribe absent a waiver by the tribe or a clear grant of authority by Congress.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (citing <i>Oklahoma Tax Comm'n</i> v. <i>Chickasaw Nation,</i> 515 U.

The Tribe's privacy policies regarding employee records \"promote tribal [self-government] interests,\" the Ninth Circuit reasoned; notably, those policies fostered \"a trusting relationship with tribal members,\" and \"affect[ed] the Casino, the Tribe's predominant source of economic development revenue.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The appeals court recognized the State's countervailing \"interest in investigating potential welfare fraud,\" but thought it incumbent upon the State to further that interest \"through far less intrusive means.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court of Appeals also ruled that the District Attorney and the Sheriff were not shielded by qualified immunity. \"[A] reasonable county officer,\" it held, \"would have known . . . that seizing tribal property held on tribal land violated the Fourth Amendment because the property and land were outside the officer's jurisdiction.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 568. The appeals court acknowledged prior Ninth Circuit precedent holding that the right to tribal self-government is not protected by &#167;1983. <i>Id.,</i> at 568, n. 7 (citing <i>Hoopa Valley Tribe</i> v. <i>Nevins,</i> 881 F. 2d 657 (1989)); see Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 29, n. 15. But in this case, the Court of Appeals concluded, a &#167;1983 claim could be maintained because the Tribe sought \"protection from an unlawful search and seizure,\" a right secured by the Fourth Amendment and therefore within &#167;1983's compass. 291 F. 3d, at 568, and n. 7.

Although this case does not squarely present the question, the parties agree, and we will assume for purposes of this opinion, that Native American tribes, like States of the Union, are not subject to suit under &#167;1983.

Furthermore, the Government urges, given the Court's decision that \"person\" excludes sovereigns as defendants under &#167;1983, it would be anomalous for the Court to give the same word a different meaning when it appears later in the same sentence. <i>Id.,</i> at 8; see <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Gardner,</i> 513 U.

S. C. &#167;1983. The Tribe's complaint, however, does not state a cause of action under &#167;1983 because the county's alleged infringement of the Tribe's sovereign prerogatives did not deprive the Tribe of \"rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\" within the meaning of &#167;1983. At bottom, rather than relying on an Act of Congress or a provision of the Constitution, the Tribe's complaint rests on the judgemade doctrine of tribal immunity&#8212;a doctrine that \"developed almost by accident.\" <i>Kiowa Tribe of Okla.</i> v. <i>Manufacturing Technologies, Inc.,</i> 523 U. S. 751, 756 (1998). Because many applications of that doctrine are both anomalous and unjust, see <i>id.,</i> at 760, 764-766 (STEVENS, J., dissenting), I would not accord it the same status as the \"laws\" referenced in &#167;1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is demeaning to Native American tribes to deny them the same access to a &#167;1983 remedy that is available to any other person whose constitutional rights are violated by persons acting under color of state law. The text of &#167;1983&#8212;which provides that &#167;1983 defendants are \"person[s] who, under color of [State law]\" subject any \"other person\" to a deprivation of a federal right&#8212;adequately explains why a tribe is not a person subject to suit under &#167;1983. For tribes generally do not act under color of state law. But that text sheds no light on the question whether the tribe is an \"other person\" who may bring a &#167;1983 suit when the tribe is the victim of a constitutional violation. The ordinary meaning of the word \"person\" as used in federal statutes,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> as well as the specific remedial purpose of &#167;1983, support the conclusion that a tribe should be able to invoke the protections of the statute if its constitutional rights are violated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, however, the Tribe's allegations do not state a cause of action under &#167;1983. The execution of the warrant challenged in this case would unquestionably have been lawful if the casino had been the property of an ordinary commercial corporation. See <i>ante,</i> at 9 (\"There is in this case no allegation that the County lacked probable cause or that the warrant was otherwise defective\"). Thus, the Tribe rests its case entirely on its claim that, as a sovereign, it should be accorded a special immunity that private casinos do not enjoy. See <i>ibid.</i> That sort of claim to special privileges, which is based entirely on the Tribe's sovereign status, is not one for which the &#167;1983 remedy was enacted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, while I agree with the Court that the judgment should be set aside, I do not join the Court's opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Dictionary Act, which was passed just two months before &#167;1983 and was designed to supply rules of construction for all legislation, provided that \"the word `person' may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate....\" Act of Feb. 25, 1871, &#167;2, 16 Stat. 431</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Our holding in<i>Will</i> v. <i>Michigan Dept. of State Police,</i> 491 U.

When the Inyo County District Attorney asked the Casino for the employment records of three Casino employees under investigation for welfare fraud, the Tribe responded that its privacy policy precluded release of the records without the employees' consent. The District Attorney, on showing probable cause, then obtained and executed a search warrant authorizing a search of the Casino for payroll records of the three employees. The District Attorney subsequently asked for the records of six other Casino employees. The Tribe reiterated its privacy policy, but offered to accept as evidence of consent a redacted copy of the last page of each employee's signed welfare application. The District Attorney refused the offer. To ward off any additional searches, the Tribe and its Gaming Corporation filed suit in Federal District Court against the District Attorney and the Sheriff, in their individual and official capacities, and the County. Asserting federalquestion jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. &#167;&#167;1331, 1337, 1343(i)(3)(4), and the federal common law of Indian affairs, the Tribe sought injunctive and declaratory relief to vindicate its status as a sovereign immune from state processes under federal law, and to establish that state law was preempted to the extent that it purported to authorize seizure of tribal records. The Tribe also sought relief under 42 U. S. C. &#167;1983, including compensatory damages, alleging that the defendants violated the Tribe's and Gaming Corporation's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and the Tribe's right to selfgovernment. The District Court, on defendants' motion, dismissed the Tribe's complaint, holding, <i>inter alia,</i> that tribal sovereign immunity did not categorically preclude the search and seizure of the Casino's personnel records. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that execution of a search warrant against the Tribe interfered with \"the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.\" <i>Williams</i> v. <i>Lee,</i> 358 U. S. 217, 220 (1959). Acknowledging a prior decision in which it held that the right to tribal self-government is not protected by &#167;1983, the court concluded that, in this case, a &#167;1983 claim could be maintained because the Tribe sought protection from an unlawful search and seizure, a right secured by the Fourth Amendment and therefore within &#167;1983's compass.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Held:</i>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The Tribe may not sue under &#167;1983 to vindicate the sovereign right it here claims. Section 1983 permits \"citizen[s]\" and \"other person[ s] within the jurisdiction\" of the United States to seek legal and equitable relief from \"person[s]\" who, under color of state law, deprive them of federally protected rights. Although this case does not squarely present the question, the Court assumes that tribes, like States, are not subject to suit under &#167;1983. See <i>Michigan Dept. of State</i> v. <i>Will,</i> 491 U. S. 58. The issue pivotal here is whether a tribe qualifies <i>as a claimant</i>&#8212;a \"person within the jurisdiction\" of the United States&#8212;under &#167;1983. Qualification of a sovereign as a \"person\" who may maintain a particular claim for relief depends not \"upon a bare analysis of the word `person,'\" <i>Pfizer Inc.</i> v. <i>Government of India,</i> 434 U. S. 308, 317, but on the \"legislative environment\" in which the word appears, <i>Georgia</i> v. <i>Evans,</i> 316 U. S. 159, 161. There is in this case no allegation that the County lacked probable cause or that the warrant was otherwise defective. It is only by virtue of the Tribe's asserted \"sovereign\" status that it claims immunity from the County's processes. Section 1983 was designed to secure private rights against government encroachment, see <i>Will,</i> 491 U. S., at 66, not to advance a sovereign's prerogative to withhold evidence relevant to a criminal investigation. For example, a tribal member complaining of a Fourth Amendment violation would be a \"person\" qualified to sue under &#167;1983. But, like other persons, that member would have no immunity from an appropriately executed search warrant based on probable cause. The Tribe, accordingly, may not sue under &#167;1983 to vindicate the sovereign right it here claims. Pp. 6-10.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Tribe has not explained, and the trial and appellate courts have not clearly decided, what prescription of federal common law, if any, enables the Tribe to maintain an action for declaratory and injunctive relief establishing its sovereign right to be free from state criminal processes. This case is therefore remanded for focused consideration and resolution of that jurisdictional question.

Pursuing the investigation, county law-enforcement officers executed a state court warrant for casino employment records kept by the Tribe on its reservation. The Tribe sued the County, the District Attorney, and the Sheriff in federal court, asserting sovereign immunity from state court processes and seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties and, as <i>amicus curiae,</i> the United States agree that a Native American Tribe, like a State of the United States, is not a \"person\" subject to suit under 42 U. S. C. &#167;1983. We hold that, in the situation here presented, the Tribe does not qualify as a \"person\" who may sue under &#167;1983. Whether the Tribe's suit qualifies for federal-court jurisdiction because it arises under some federal law other than &#167;1983 is an issue the parties have not precisely addressed, and the trial and appellate courts have not clearly decided.

Thus, in <i>Georgia,</i> the Court held that a State, as purchaser of asphalt shipped in interstate commerce, qualified as a \"person\" entitled to seek redress under the Sherman Act for restraint of trade. <i>Id.,</i> at 160-163.

It is only by virtue of the Tribe's asserted \"sovereign\" status that it claims immunity from the County's processes. See App. 97-105, &#182;&#182;1-25, 108-110, &#182;&#182;33-39; 291 F. 3d, at 554 (Court of Appeals \"find[s] that the County and its agents <i>violated the Tribe's sovereign immunity</i> when they obtained and executed a search warrant against the Tribe and tribal property.\" (emphasis added)). Section 1983 was designed to secure private rights against government encroachment, see <i>Will,</i> 491 U. S., at 66, not to advance a sovereign's prerogative to withhold evidence relevant to a criminal investigation. For example, as the County acknowledges, a tribal member complaining of a Fourth Amendment violation would be a \"person\" qualified to sue under &#167;1983. See Brief for Petitioners 20, n. 7. But, like other private persons, that member would have no right to immunity from an appropriately executed search warrant based on probable cause. Accordingly, we hold that the Tribe may not sue under &#167;1983 to vindicate the sovereign right it here claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to &#167;1983, the Tribe asserted as law under which its claims arise the \"federal common law of Indian affairs.\" <i>Supra,</i> at 4 (quoting App. 97, &#182;1). But the Tribe has not explained, and neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals appears to have carefully considered, what prescription of federal common law enables a tribe to maintain an action for declaratory and injunctive relief establishing its sovereign right to be free from state criminal processes. In short, absent &#167;1983 as a foundation for the Tribe's action, it is unclear what federal law, if any, the Tribe's case \"aris[es] under.\" 28 U. S. C. &#167;1331.

S. C. &#167;1983. The Tribe's complaint, however, does not state a cause of action under &#167;1983 because the county's alleged infringement of the Tribe's sovereign prerogatives did not deprive the Tribe of \"rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\" within the meaning of &#167;1983. At bottom, rather than relying on an Act of Congress or a provision of the Constitution, the Tribe's complaint rests on the judgemade doctrine of tribal immunity&#8212;a doctrine that \"developed almost by accident.\" <i>Kiowa Tribe of Okla.</i> v. <i>Manufacturing Technologies, Inc.,</i> 523 U. S. 751, 756 (1998). Because many applications of that doctrine are both anomalous and unjust, see <i>id.,</i> at 760, 764-766 (STEVENS, J., dissenting), I would not accord it the same status as the \"laws\" referenced in &#167;1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is demeaning to Native American tribes to deny them the same access to a &#167;1983 remedy that is available to any other person whose constitutional rights are violated by persons acting under color of state law. The text of &#167;1983&#8212;which provides that &#167;1983 defendants are \"person[s] who, under color of [State law]\" subject any \"other person\" to a deprivation of a federal right&#8212;adequately explains why a tribe is not a person subject to suit under &#167;1983. For tribes generally do not act under color of state law. But that text sheds no light on the question whether the tribe is an \"other person\" who may bring a &#167;1983 suit when the tribe is the victim of a constitutional violation. The ordinary meaning of the word \"person\" as used in federal statutes,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> as well as the specific remedial purpose of &#167;1983, support the conclusion that a tribe should be able to invoke the protections of the statute if its constitutional rights are violated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, however, the Tribe's allegations do not state a cause of action under &#167;1983. The execution of the warrant challenged in this case would unquestionably have been lawful if the casino had been the property of an ordinary commercial corporation. See <i>ante,</i> at 9 (\"There is in this case no allegation that the County lacked probable cause or that the warrant was otherwise defective\"). Thus, the Tribe rests its case entirely on its claim that, as a sovereign, it should be accorded a special immunity that private casinos do not enjoy. See <i>ibid.</i> That sort of claim to special privileges, which is based entirely on the Tribe's sovereign status, is not one for which the &#167;1983 remedy was enacted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, while I agree with the Court that the judgment should be set aside, I do not join the Court's opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Dictionary Act, which was passed just two months before &#167;1983 and was designed to supply rules of construction for all legislation, provided that \"the word `person' may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate....\" Act of Feb. 25, 1871, &#167;2, 16 Stat. 431</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Our holding in<i>Will</i> v. <i>Michigan Dept. of State Police,</i> 491 U.
