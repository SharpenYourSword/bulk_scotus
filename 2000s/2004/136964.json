The Colorado General Assembly failed to pass a congressional redistricting plan in time for the 2002 elections. In response to a suit brought by Colorado voters, a Colorado State District Court drew a congressional district map for the 2002 elections that took account of the new census figures and conformed to federal voting rights requirements. <i>Avalos</i> v. <i>Davidson,</i> No. 01-CV-2897, 2002 WL 1895406 (Jan. 25, 2002), aff'd <i>sub nom.

Shortly thereafter, the Colorado Attorney General, Ken Salazar, filed an original action in the Supreme Court of Colorado, seeking an injunction to prevent the Colorado Secretary of State, Donetta Davidson, from implementing the General Assembly's redistricting plan and requesting a writ of mandamus requiring Davidson to return to the 2002 redistricting plan. The General Assembly intervened on the respondents' side to join Davidson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court of Colorado held, <i>inter alia,</i> that Article V, &#167; 44, of the Colorado Constitution limits redistricting to once per decade, to be completed in the time between the decennial census and the first election of the decade. <i>People ex rel.

We further hold that regardless of the method by which the districts are created, the state constitution prohibits redrawing the districts until after the next decennial census.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court ordered Davidson to employ the judicially created plan through the 2010 elections.

The General Assembly and Davidson have asked this Court to review the Colorado Supreme Court's conclusion that Article V, &#167; 44, of the Colorado Constitution (as construed by the Supreme Court of Colorado) does not violate Article I, &#167; 4, cl. 1, of the Federal Constitution. While not disputing state courts' remedial authority to impose temporary redistricting plans \"so long as the legislature does not fulfill its duty to redistrict,\" Pet. for Cert. 22, they argue that the <i>permanent</i> use of a court-ordered plan, despite the legislature's proposal of a valid alternative, violates the Federal Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Article I, &#167; 4, cl. 1, of the United States Constitution provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By interpreting \"general assembly\" in Article V, &#167; 44, of the Colorado Constitution to include the state courts, the Supreme Court of Colorado held that the Colorado Constitution makes the state courts part of the legislative process. The court relies on <i>Smiley</i> v. <i>Holm,</i> 285 U.
