Section 113(f)(1) specifies that a party may obtain contribution \"during or following any civil action\" under CERCLA \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a). The issue we must decide is whether a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*161</span> private party who has not been sued under \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a) may nevertheless obtain contribution under \u00a7 113(f)(1) from other liable parties. We hold that it may not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Under CERCLA, 94 Stat. 2767, the Federal Government may clean up a contaminated area itself, see \u00a7 104, or it may compel responsible parties to perform the cleanup, see \u00a7 106(a). See <i>Key Tronic Corp.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 511 U. S. 809, 814 (1994). In either case, the Government may recover its response costs under \u00a7 107, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 9607 (2000 ed. and Supp. I), the \"cost recovery\" section of CERCLA. Section 107(a) lists four classes of potentially responsible persons (PRPs) and provides that they \"shall be liable\" for, among other things, \"all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the United States Government . . . not inconsistent with the national contingency plan.\" \u00a7 107(a)(4)(A).<sup>[2]</sup> Section 107(a) further provides that PRPs shall be liable for \"any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the national contingency plan.\" \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B).</p>\n<p>After CERCLA's enactment in 1980, litigation arose over whether \u00a7 107, in addition to allowing the Government and certain private parties to recover costs from PRPs, also allowed a PRP that had incurred response costs to recover costs from other PRPs. More specifically, the question was whether a private party that had incurred response costs, but that had done so voluntarily and was not itself subject to suit, had a cause of action for cost recovery against other PRPs. Various courts held that \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) and its predecessors authorized such a cause of action. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Wickland Oil Terminals</i> v. <i>Asarco, Inc.,</i> 792 F. 2d 887, 890-892 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*162</span> (CA9 1986); <i>Walls</i> v. <i>Waste Resource Corp.,</i> 761 F. 2d 311, 317-318 (CA6 1985); <i>Philadelphia</i> v. <i>Stepan Chemical Co.,</i> 544 F. Supp. 1135, 1140-1143 (ED Pa. 1982).</p>\n<p>After CERCLA's passage, litigation also ensued over the separate question whether a private entity that had been sued in a cost recovery action (by the Government or by another PRP) could obtain contribution from other PRPs. As originally enacted in 1980, CERCLA contained no provision expressly providing for a right of action for contribution. A number of District Courts nonetheless held that, although CERCLA did not mention the word \"contribution,\" such a right arose either impliedly from provisions of the statute, or as a matter of federal common law. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>New Castle County,</i> 642 F. Supp. 1258, 1263-1269 (Del. 1986) (contribution right arises under federal common law); <i>Colorado</i> v. <i>ASARCO, Inc.,</i> 608 F. Supp. 1484, 1486-1493 (Colo. 1985) (same); <i>Wehner</i> v. <i>Syntex Agribusiness, Inc.,</i> 616 F. Supp. 27, 31 (ED Mo. 1985) (contribution right is implied from \u00a7 107(e)(2)). That conclusion was debatable in light of two decisions of this Court that refused to recognize implied or common-law rights to contribution in other federal statutes. See <i>Texas Industries, Inc.</i> v. <i>Radcliff Materials, Inc.,</i> 451 U. S. 630, 638-647 (1981) (refusing to recognize implied or common-law right to contribution in the Sherman Act or the Clayton Act); <i>Northwest Airlines, Inc.</i> v. <i>Transport Workers,</i> 451 U. S. 77, 90-99 (1981) (refusing to recognize implied or common-law right to contribution in the Equal Pay Act of 1963 or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964).</p>\n<p>Congress subsequently amended CERCLA in the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), 100 Stat. 1613, to provide an express cause of action for contribution, codified as CERCLA \u00a7 113(f)(1):</p>\n<blockquote>\"Any person may seek contribution from any other person who is liable or potentially liable under section <span class=\"star-pagination\">*163</span> 9607(a) of this title, during or following any civil action under section 9606 of this title or under section 9607(a) of this title. Such claims shall be brought in accordance with this section and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and shall be governed by Federal law. In resolving contribution claims, the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate. Nothing in this subsection shall diminish the right of any person to bring an action for contribution in the absence of a civil action under section 9606 of this title or section 9607 of this title.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1647, as codified in 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 9613(f)(1).</blockquote>\n<p>SARA also created a separate express right of contribution, \u00a7 113(f)(3)(B), for \"[a] person who has resolved its liability to the United States or a State for some or all of a response action or for some or all of the costs of such action in an administrative or judicially approved settlement.\" In short, after SARA, CERCLA provided for a right to cost recovery in certain circumstances, \u00a7 107(a), and separate rights to contribution in other circumstances, \u00a7\u00a7 113(f)(1), 113(f)(3)(B).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>This case concerns four contaminated aircraft engine maintenance sites in Texas. Cooper Industries, Inc., owned and operated those sites until 1981, when it sold them to Aviall Services, Inc. Aviall operated the four sites for a number of years. Ultimately, Aviall discovered that both it and Cooper had contaminated the facilities when petroleum <span class=\"star-pagination\">*164</span> and other hazardous substances leaked into the ground and ground water through underground storage tanks and spills.</p>\n<p>Aviall notified the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (Commission) of the contamination. The Commission informed Aviall that it was violating state environmental laws, directed Aviall to clean up the site, and threatened to pursue an enforcement action if Aviall failed to undertake remediation. Neither the Commission nor the EPA, however, took judicial or administrative measures to compel cleanup.</p>\n<p>Aviall cleaned up the properties under the State's supervision, beginning in 1984. Aviall sold the properties to a third party in 1995 and 1996, but remains contractually responsible for the cleanup. Aviall has incurred approximately $5 million in cleanup costs; the total costs may be even greater. In August 1997, Aviall filed this action against Cooper in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, seeking to recover cleanup costs. The original complaint asserted a claim for cost recovery under CERCLA \u00a7 107(a), a separate claim for contribution under CERCLA \u00a7 113(f)(1), and state-law claims. Aviall later amended the complaint, combining its two CERCLA claims into a single, joint CERCLA claim. That claim alleged that, pursuant to \u00a7 113(f)(1), Aviall was entitled to seek contribution from Cooper, as a PRP under \u00a7 107(a), for response costs and other liability Aviall incurred in connection with the Texas facilities.<sup>[4]</sup> Aviall continued to assert state-law claims as well.</p>\n<p>Both parties moved for summary judgment, and the District Court granted Cooper's motion. The court held that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*165</span> Aviall, having abandoned its \u00a7 107 claim, sought contribution only under \u00a7 113(f)(1). The court held that \u00a7 113(f)(1) relief was unavailable to Aviall because it had not been sued under CERCLA \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107. Having dismissed Aviall's federal claim, the court declined to exercise jurisdiction over the state-law claims.</p>\n<p>A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 263 F. 3d 134 (2001). The majority, relying principally on the \"during or following\" language in the first sentence of \u00a7 113(f)(1), held that \"a PRP seeking contribution from other PRPs under \u00a7 113(f)(1) must have a pending or adjudged \u00a7 106 administrative order or \u00a7 107(a) cost recovery action against it.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 145. The dissent reasoned that the final sentence of \u00a7 113(f)(1), the saving clause, clarified that the federal common-law right to contribution survived the enactment of \u00a7 113(f)(1), even absent a \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a) civil action. <i>Id.,</i> at 148-150 (opinion of Wiener, J.).</p>\n<p>On rehearing en banc, the Fifth Circuit reversed by a divided vote, holding that \u00a7 113(f)(1) allows a PRP to obtain contribution from other PRPs regardless of whether the PRP has been sued under \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107. 312 F. 3d 677 (2002). The court held that \"[s]ection 113(f)(1) authorizes suits against PRPs in both its first and last sentence[,] which states without qualification that `nothing' in the section shall `diminish' any person's right to bring a contribution action in the absence of a section 106 or section 107(a) action.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 681. The court reasoned in part that \"may\" in \u00a7 113(f)(1) did not mean \"may only.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 686-687. Three members of the en banc court dissented for essentially the reasons given by the panel majority. <i>Id.,</i> at 691-693 (opinion of Garza, J.). We granted certiorari, 540 U. S. 1099 (2004), and now reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Section 113(f)(1) does not authorize Aviall's suit. The first sentence, the enabling clause that establishes the right <span class=\"star-pagination\">*166</span> of contribution, provides: \"Any person <i>may</i> seek contribution . . . <i>during or following</i> any civil action under section 9606 of this title or under section 9607(a) of this title,\" 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 9613(f)(1) (emphasis added). The natural meaning of this sentence is that contribution may only be sought subject to the specified conditions, namely, \"during or following\" a specified civil action.</p>\n<p>Aviall answers that \"may\" should be read permissively, such that \"during or following\" a civil action is one, but not the exclusive, instance in which a person may seek contribution. We disagree. First, as just noted, the natural meaning of \"may\" in the context of the enabling clause is that it authorizes certain contribution actions\u0097ones that satisfy the subsequent specified condition\u0097and no others.</p>\n<p>Second, and relatedly, if \u00a7 113(f)(1) were read to authorize contribution actions at any time, regardless of the existence of a \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a) civil action, then Congress need not have included the explicit \"during or following\" condition. In other words, Aviall's reading would render part of the statute entirely superfluous, something we are loath to do. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Hibbs</i> v. <i>Winn,</i> 542 U. S. 88, 101 (2004). Likewise, if \u00a7 113(f)(1) authorizes contribution actions at any time, \u00a7 113(f)(3)(B), which permits contribution actions after settlement, is equally superfluous. There is no reason why Congress would bother to specify conditions under which a person may bring a contribution claim, and at the same time allow contribution actions absent those conditions.</p>\n<p>The last sentence of \u00a7 113(f)(1), the saving clause, does not change our conclusion. That sentence provides: \"Nothing in this subsection shall diminish the right of any person to bring an action for contribution in the absence of a civil action under section 9606 of this title or section 9607 of this title.\" 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 9613(f)(1). The sole function of the sentence is to clarify that \u00a7 113(f)(1) does nothing to \"diminish\" any cause(s) of action for contribution that may exist independently of \u00a7 113(f)(1). In other words, the sentence rebuts <span class=\"star-pagination\">*167</span> any presumption that the express right of contribution provided by the enabling clause is the exclusive cause of action for contribution available to a PRP. The sentence, however, does not itself establish a cause of action; nor does it expand \u00a7 113(f)(1) to authorize contribution actions not brought \"during or following\" a \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a) civil action; nor does it specify what causes of action for contribution, if any, exist outside \u00a7 113(f)(1). Reading the saving clause to authorize \u00a7 113(f)(1) contribution actions not just \"during or following\" a civil action, but also before such an action, would again violate the settled rule that we must, if possible, construe a statute to give every word some operative effect. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Nordic Village, Inc.,</i> 503 U. S. 30, 35-36 (1992).</p>\n<p>Our conclusion follows not simply from \u00a7 113(f)(1) itself, but also from the whole of \u00a7 113. As noted above, \u00a7 113 provides two express avenues for contribution: \u00a7 113(f)(1) (\"during or following\" specified civil actions) and \u00a7 113(f)(3)(B) (after an administrative or judicially approved settlement that resolves liability to the United States or a State). Section 113(g)(3) then provides two corresponding 3-year limitations periods for contribution actions, one beginning at the date of judgment, \u00a7 113(g)(3)(A), and one beginning at the date of settlement, \u00a7 113(g)(3)(B). Notably absent from \u00a7 113(g)(3) is any provision for starting the limitations period if a judgment or settlement never occurs, as is the case with a purely voluntary cleanup. The lack of such a provision supports the conclusion that, to assert a contribution claim under \u00a7 113(f), a party must satisfy the conditions of either \u00a7 113(f)(1) or \u00a7 113(f)(3)(B).</p>\n<p>Each side insists that the purpose of CERCLA bolsters its reading of \u00a7 113(f)(1). Given the clear meaning of the text, there is no need to resolve this dispute or to consult the purpose of CERCLA at all. As we have said: \"[I]t is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\" <i>Oncale</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*168</span> v. <i>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</i> 523 U. S. 75, 79 (1998). Section 113(f)(1), 100 Stat. 1647, authorizes contribution claims only \"during or following\" a civil action under \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a), and it is undisputed that Aviall has never been subject to such an action.<sup>[5]</sup> Aviall therefore has no \u00a7 113(f)(1) claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Aviall and <i>amicus</i> Lockheed Martin contend that, in the alternative to an action for contribution under \u00a7 113(f)(1), Aviall may recover costs under \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) even though it is a PRP. The dissent would have us so hold. We decline to address the issue. Neither the District Court, nor the Fifth Circuit panel, nor the Fifth Circuit sitting en banc considered Aviall's \u00a7 107 claim. In fact, as noted above, Aviall included separate \u00a7 107 and \u00a7 113 claims in its original complaint, but then asserted a \"combined\" \u00a7 107/\u00a7 113 claim in its amended complaint. The District Court took this consolidated claim to mean that Aviall was relying on \u00a7 107 \"not as an independent cause of action,\" but only \"to the extent necessary to maintain a viable \u00a7 113(f)(1) contribution claim.\" Civ. Action No. 3:97-CV-1926-D (ND Tex., Jan. 13, 2000), App. to Pet. for Cert. 94a, n. 2. Consequently the court saw no need to address any freestanding \u00a7 107 claim. The Fifth Circuit panel likewise concluded that Aviall no longer advanced a standalone \u00a7 107 claim. 263 F. 3d, at 137, n. 2. The en banc court found it unnecessary to decide whether Aviall had waived the \u00a7 107 claim, because it held that Aviall could rely instead on \u00a7 113. 312 F. 3d, at 685, n. 15. Thus, the court did not address the waiver issue, let alone the merits of the \u00a7 107 claim.</p>\n<p>\"We ordinarily do not decide in the first instance issues not decided below.\" <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Mineta,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*169</span> 534 U. S. 103, 109 (2001) (<i>per curiam</i>) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although we have deviated from this rule in exceptional circumstances, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Mendenhall,</i> 446 U. S. 544, 551-552, n. 5 (1980), the circumstances here cut <i>against</i> resolving the \u00a7 107 claim. Both the question whether Aviall has waived this claim and the underlying \u00a7 107 question (if it is not waived) may depend in part on the relationship between \u00a7\u00a7 107 and 113. That relationship is a significant issue in its own right. It is also well beyond the scope of the briefing and, indeed, the question presented, which asks simply whether a private party \"may bring an action seeking contribution pursuant to CERCLA Section 113(f)(1).\" Pet. for Cert. i. The \u00a7 107 claim and the preliminary waiver question merit full consideration by the courts below.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the parties cite numerous decisions of the Courts of Appeals as holding that a private party that is itself a PRP may not pursue a \u00a7 107(a) action against other PRPs for joint and several liability. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Bedford Affiliates</i> v. <i>Sills,</i> 156 F. 3d 416, 423-424 (CA2 1998); <i>Centerior Serv. Co.</i> v. <i>Acme Scrap Iron &amp; Metal Corp.,</i> 153 F. 3d 344, 349-356 (CA6 1998); <i>Pneumo Abex Corp.</i> v. <i>High Point, T &amp; D. R. Co.,</i> 142 F. 3d 769, 776 (CA4 1998); <i>Pinal Creek Group</i> v. <i>Newmont Mining Corp.,</i> 118 F. 3d 1298, 1301-1306 (CA9 1997); <i>New Castle County</i> v. <i>Halliburton NUS Corp.,</i> 111 F. 3d 1116, 1120-1124 (CA3 1997); <i>Redwing Carriers, Inc.</i> v. <i>Saraland Apartments,</i> 94 F. 3d 1489, 1496, and n. 7 (CA11 1996); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Colorado &amp; E. R. Co.,</i> 50 F. 3d 1530, 1534-1536 (CA10 1995); <i>United Technologies Corp.</i> v. <i>Browning-Ferris Industries,</i> 33 F. 3d 96, 98-103 (CA1 1994). To hold here that Aviall may pursue a \u00a7 107 action, we would have to consider whether these decisions are correct, an issue that Aviall has flagged but not briefed. And we might have to consider other issues, also not briefed, such as whether Aviall, which seeks to recover the share of its cleanup costs fairly chargeable to Cooper, may pursue a \u00a7 107 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*170</span> cost recovery action for some form of liability other than joint and several. We think it more prudent to withhold judgment on these matters.</p>\n<p>In view of the importance of the \u00a7 107 issue and the absence of briefing and decisions by the courts below, we are not prepared\u0097as the dissent would have it\u0097to resolve the \u00a7 107 question solely on the basis of dictum in <i>Key Tronic.</i> We held there that certain attorney's fees were not \"`necessary costs of response'\" within the meaning of \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B). 511 U. S., at 818-821. But we did not address the relevance, if any, of Key Tronic's status as a PRP or confront the relationship between \u00a7\u00a7 107 and 113. In discussing \u00a7 107, we did not even classify it precisely as a right of cost recovery or a right of contribution, as the dissent's descriptions of the decision reveal. <i>Post,</i> at 172 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.) (describing <i>Key Tronic</i> as recognizing a right to \"`seek recovery of cleanup costs'\" (quoting 511 U. S., at 818), but in the following paragraph saying that <i>Key Tronic</i> identified a \"right to contribution\"). \"Questions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents.\" <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Fall,</i> 266 U. S. 507, 511 (1925). Aviall itself recognizes the need for fuller examination of the \u00a7 107 claim; it has simply requested that we remand for consideration of that claim, not that we resolve the claim in the first instance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>In addition to leaving open whether Aviall may seek cost recovery under \u00a7 107, Part III-B, <i>supra,</i> we decline to decide whether Aviall has an implied right to contribution under \u00a7 107. Portions of the Fifth Circuit's opinion below might be taken to endorse the latter cause of action, 312 F. 3d, at 687; others appear to reserve the question whether such a cause of action exists, <i>id.,</i> at 685, n. 15. To the extent that Aviall chooses to frame its \u00a7 107 claim on remand as an implied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*171</span> right of contribution (as opposed to a right of cost recovery),<sup>[6]</sup> we note that this Court has visited the subject of implied rights of contribution before. See <i>Texas Industries,</i> 451 U. S., at 638-647; <i>Northwest Airlines,</i> 451 U. S., at 90-99. We also note that, in enacting \u00a7 113(f)(1), Congress explicitly recognized a particular set (claims \"during or following\" the specified civil actions) of the contribution rights previously implied by courts from provisions of CERCLA and the common law. Cf. <i>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Lewis,</i> 444 U. S. 11, 19 (1979). Nonetheless, we need not and do not decide today whether any judicially implied right of contribution survived the passage of SARA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>We hold only that \u00a7 113(f)(1) does not support Aviall's suit. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Aviall Services, Inc., purchased from Cooper Industries, Inc., property that was contaminated with hazardous substances. Shortly after the purchase, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission notified Aviall that it would institute enforcement action if Aviall failed to remediate the property. Aviall promptly cleaned up the site and now seeks reimbursement from Cooper. In my view, the Court unnecessarily defers decision on Aviall's entitlement to recover cleanup costs from Cooper.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*172</span> In <i>Key Tronic Corp.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 511 U. S. 809, 818 (1994), all Members of this Court agreed that \u00a7 107 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 9607, \"unquestionably provides a cause of action for [potentially responsible persons (PRPs)] to seek recovery of cleanup costs.\" The Court rested that determination squarely and solely on \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B), which allows <i>any</i> person who has incurred costs for cleaning up a hazardous waste site to recover all or a portion of those costs from any other person liable under CERCLA.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The <i>Key Tronic</i> Court divided, however, on the question whether the right to contribution is implicit in \u00a7 107(a)'s text, as the majority determined, or whether \u00a7 107(a) expressly confers the right, as the dissenters urged. The majority stated: Section 107 \"<i>implies</i>\u0097but does not expressly <i>command</i>\u0097that [a PRP] may have a claim for contribution against those treated as joint tortfeasors.\" 511 U. S., at 818, and n. 11 (emphasis added). The dissent maintained: \"Section 107(a)(4)(B) states, as clearly as can be, that `[c]overed persons . . . shall be liable for . . . necessary costs of response incurred by any other person.' Surely to say that A shall be liable to B is the <i>express</i> creation of a right of action.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 822. But no Justice expressed the slightest doubt that \u00a7 107 indeed did enable a PRP to sue other covered persons for reimbursement, in whole or part, of cleanup costs the PRP legitimately incurred.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*173</span> In its original complaint, Aviall identified \u00a7 107 as the federal-law basis for an independent cost-recovery claim against Cooper, and \u00a7 113 as the basis for a contribution claim. App. 8A, 16A-17A. In amended pleadings, Aviall alleged both \u00a7\u00a7 107 and 113 as the federal underpinning for its contribution claim. <i>Id.,</i> at 27A, 48A. Aviall's use of \u00a7\u00a7 113 and 107 in tandem to assert a contribution claim conformed its pleading to then-governing Fifth Circuit precedent, which held that a CERCLA contribution action arises through the joint operation of \u00a7\u00a7 107(a) and 113(f)(1). See <i>Geraghty &amp; Miller, Inc.</i> v. <i>Conoco Inc.,</i> 234 F. 3d 917, 924 (2000) (\"[W]hile section 113(f) is the vehicle for bringing a contribution action, it does not create a new cause of action or create any new liabilities. Rather, it is a mechanism for apportioning costs that are recoverable under section 107.\" (footnote omitted)). A party obliged by circuit precedent to plead in a certain way can hardly be deemed to have waived a plea the party could have maintained had the law of the circuit permitted him to do so. But cf. <i>ante,</i> at 168-169.</p>\n<p>In the Fifth Circuit's view, \u00a7 107 supplied the right of action for Aviall's claim, and \u00a7 113(f)(1) prescribed the procedural framework. 312 F. 3d 677, 683, and n. 10 (2002) (en banc) (stating that \u00a7 107 \"impliedly authorizes a cause of action for contribution\" and \u00a7 113(f) \"govern[s] and regulate[s]\" the action (citing <i>Geraghty &amp; Miller,</i> 234 F. 3d, at 924) (internal quotation marks omitted)); see \u00a7 113(f)(1) (calling for the governance of \"Federal law\" and the application of \"the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\" and specifying that \"[i]n resolving contribution claims, the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate\"). Notably, Aviall expressly urged in the Court of Appeals that, were the court to conclude that \u00a7 113(f)(1)'s \"during or following\" language excluded application of that section to this case, Aviall's suit should be adjudicated independently under \u00a7 107(a). See Response of Appellant Aviall Services, Inc., to the <i>Amicus</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*174</span> <i>Curiae</i> Brief for United States in No. 00-10197 (CA5), p. 24 (\"[P]arties who are excluded from seeking contribution under section 113(f)(1) must therefore have available to them the broader right of cost recovery [covering both full recovery and contribution] under section 107(a).\"); cf. <i>Key Tronic,</i> 511 U. S., at 816 (\"[T]he statute now expressly authorizes a cause of action for contribution in \u00a7 113 and impliedly authorizes a similar and somewhat overlapping remedy in \u00a7 107.\").</p>\n<p>I see no cause for protracting this litigation by requiring the Fifth Circuit to revisit a determination it has essentially made already: Federal courts, prior to the enactment of \u00a7 113(f)(1), had correctly held that PRPs could \"recover [under \u00a7 107] a proportionate share of their costs in actions for contribution against other PRPs,\" 312 F. 3d, at 687;<sup>[2]</sup> nothing in \u00a7 113 retracts that right, <i>ibid.</i> (noting that \u00a7 113(f)'s saving clause preserves all preexisting state and federal rights of action for contribution, including the \u00a7 107 implied right this Court recognized in <i>Key Tronic,</i> 511 U. S., at 816). Accordingly, I would not defer a definitive ruling by this Court on the question whether Aviall may pursue a \u00a7 107 claim for relief against Cooper.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging affirmance were filed for the State of New York et al. by <i>Eliot Spitzer,</i> Attorney General of New York, <i>Caitlin J.

The cost recovery remedy of \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) and the contribution remedy of \u00a7 113(f)(1) are similar at a general level in that they both allow private parties to recoup costs from other private parties. But the two remedies are clearly distinct.</p>\n<p>[4]  Aviall asserts that it framed its claim in the manner compelled by Fifth Circuit precedent holding that a \u00a7 113 claim is a type of \u00a7 107 claim. <i>Geraghty &amp; Miller, Inc.</i> v. <i>Conoco Inc.,</i> 234 F. 3d 917, 924 (2000); see also, <i>e.g., </i><i>Centerior Serv.

S. C. \u00a7 9613(f)(1).</p>\n<p>[6]  As noted above, we do not address whether a \u00a7 107 cost recovery action by Aviall (if not waived) may seek some form of liability other than joint and several.</p>\n<p>[1]  Key Tronic, a PRP, asserted a cost-recovery claim under \u00a7 107(a) to recoup approximately $1.2 million in costs that it allegedly incurred cleaning up its site \"at its own initiative.\" <i>Key Tronic Corp.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 984 F. 2d 1025, 1026 (CA9 1993). Although Key Tronic settled a portion of its liability with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the claim advanced in Key Tronic's \u00a7 107(a) suit rested on remedial action taken before the EPA's involvement, remediation that did not figure in the settlement. <i>Id.,</i> at 1026-1027; <i>Key Tronic Corp.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 511 U.

S. 630 (1981), and <i>Northwest Airlines, Inc.</i> v. <i>Transport Workers,</i> 451 U.

Section 113(f)(1) specifies that a party may obtain contribution \"during or following any civil action\" under CERCLA \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a). The issue we must decide is whether a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*161</span> private party who has not been sued under \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a) may nevertheless obtain contribution under \u00a7 113(f)(1) from other liable parties. We hold that it may not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Under CERCLA, 94 Stat. 2767, the Federal Government may clean up a contaminated area itself, see \u00a7 104, or it may compel responsible parties to perform the cleanup, see \u00a7 106(a). See <i>Key Tronic Corp.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 511 U. S. 809, 814 (1994). In either case, the Government may recover its response costs under \u00a7 107, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 9607 (2000 ed. and Supp. I), the \"cost recovery\" section of CERCLA. Section 107(a) lists four classes of potentially responsible persons (PRPs) and provides that they \"shall be liable\" for, among other things, \"all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the United States Government . . . not inconsistent with the national contingency plan.\" \u00a7 107(a)(4)(A).<sup>[2]</sup> Section 107(a) further provides that PRPs shall be liable for \"any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the national contingency plan.\" \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B).</p>\n<p>After CERCLA's enactment in 1980, litigation arose over whether \u00a7 107, in addition to allowing the Government and certain private parties to recover costs from PRPs, also allowed a PRP that had incurred response costs to recover costs from other PRPs. More specifically, the question was whether a private party that had incurred response costs, but that had done so voluntarily and was not itself subject to suit, had a cause of action for cost recovery against other PRPs. Various courts held that \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) and its predecessors authorized such a cause of action. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Wickland Oil Terminals</i> v. <i>Asarco, Inc.,</i> 792 F. 2d 887, 890-892 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*162</span> (CA9 1986); <i>Walls</i> v. <i>Waste Resource Corp.,</i> 761 F. 2d 311, 317-318 (CA6 1985); <i>Philadelphia</i> v. <i>Stepan Chemical Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1687114\"><a href=\"/opinion/1687114/city-of-philadelphia-v-stepan-chemical-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>, 1140-1143 (ED Pa. 1982).</p>\n<p>After CERCLA's passage, litigation also ensued over the separate question whether a private entity that had been sued in a cost recovery action (by the Government or by another PRP) could obtain contribution from other PRPs. As originally enacted in 1980, CERCLA contained no provision expressly providing for a right of action for contribution. A number of District Courts nonetheless held that, although CERCLA did not mention the word \"contribution,\" such a right arose either impliedly from provisions of the statute, or as a matter of federal common law. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>New Castle County,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">642</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1258</span></span>, 1263-1269 (Del. 1986) (contribution right arises under federal common law); <i>Colorado</i> v. <i>ASARCO, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">608</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1484</span></span>, 1486-1493 (Colo. 1985) (same); <i>Wehner</i> v. <i>Syntex Agribusiness, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1812037\"><a href=\"/opinion/1812037/wehner-v-syntex-agribusiness-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">616</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 31 (ED Mo. 1985) (contribution right is implied from \u00a7 107(e)(2)). That conclusion was debatable in light of two decisions of this Court that refused to recognize implied or common-law rights to contribution in other federal statutes. See <i>Texas Industries, Inc.</i> v. <i>Radcliff Materials, Inc.,</i> 451 U. S. 630, 638-647 (1981) (refusing to recognize implied or common-law right to contribution in the Sherman Act or the Clayton Act); <i>Northwest Airlines, Inc.</i> v. <i>Transport Workers,</i> 451 U. S. 77, 90-99 (1981) (refusing to recognize implied or common-law right to contribution in the Equal Pay Act of 1963 or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964).</p>\n<p>Congress subsequently amended CERCLA in the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), 100 Stat. 1613, to provide an express cause of action for contribution, codified as CERCLA \u00a7 113(f)(1):</p>\n<blockquote>\"Any person may seek contribution from any other person who is liable or potentially liable under section <span class=\"star-pagination\">*163</span> 9607(a) of this title, during or following any civil action under section 9606 of this title or under section 9607(a) of this title. Such claims shall be brought in accordance with this section and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and shall be governed by Federal law. In resolving contribution claims, the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate. Nothing in this subsection shall diminish the right of any person to bring an action for contribution in the absence of a civil action under section 9606 of this title or section 9607 of this title.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1647, as codified in 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 9613(f)(1).</blockquote>\n<p>SARA also created a separate express right of contribution, \u00a7 113(f)(3)(B), for \"[a] person who has resolved its liability to the United States or a State for some or all of a response action or for some or all of the costs of such action in an administrative or judicially approved settlement.\" In short, after SARA, CERCLA provided for a right to cost recovery in certain circumstances, \u00a7 107(a), and separate rights to contribution in other circumstances, \u00a7\u00a7 113(f)(1), 113(f)(3)(B).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>This case concerns four contaminated aircraft engine maintenance sites in Texas. Cooper Industries, Inc., owned and operated those sites until 1981, when it sold them to Aviall Services, Inc. Aviall operated the four sites for a number of years. Ultimately, Aviall discovered that both it and Cooper had contaminated the facilities when petroleum <span class=\"star-pagination\">*164</span> and other hazardous substances leaked into the ground and ground water through underground storage tanks and spills.</p>\n<p>Aviall notified the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (Commission) of the contamination. The Commission informed Aviall that it was violating state environmental laws, directed Aviall to clean up the site, and threatened to pursue an enforcement action if Aviall failed to undertake remediation. Neither the Commission nor the EPA, however, took judicial or administrative measures to compel cleanup.</p>\n<p>Aviall cleaned up the properties under the State's supervision, beginning in 1984. Aviall sold the properties to a third party in 1995 and 1996, but remains contractually responsible for the cleanup. Aviall has incurred approximately $5 million in cleanup costs; the total costs may be even greater. In August 1997, Aviall filed this action against Cooper in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, seeking to recover cleanup costs. The original complaint asserted a claim for cost recovery under CERCLA \u00a7 107(a), a separate claim for contribution under CERCLA \u00a7 113(f)(1), and state-law claims. Aviall later amended the complaint, combining its two CERCLA claims into a single, joint CERCLA claim. That claim alleged that, pursuant to \u00a7 113(f)(1), Aviall was entitled to seek contribution from Cooper, as a PRP under \u00a7 107(a), for response costs and other liability Aviall incurred in connection with the Texas facilities.<sup>[4]</sup> Aviall continued to assert state-law claims as well.</p>\n<p>Both parties moved for summary judgment, and the District Court granted Cooper's motion. The court held that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*165</span> Aviall, having abandoned its \u00a7 107 claim, sought contribution only under \u00a7 113(f)(1). The court held that \u00a7 113(f)(1) relief was unavailable to Aviall because it had not been sued under CERCLA \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107. Having dismissed Aviall's federal claim, the court declined to exercise jurisdiction over the state-law claims.</p>\n<p>A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 263 F. 3d 134 (2001). The majority, relying principally on the \"during or following\" language in the first sentence of \u00a7 113(f)(1), held that \"a PRP seeking contribution from other PRPs under \u00a7 113(f)(1) must have a pending or adjudged \u00a7 106 administrative order or \u00a7 107(a) cost recovery action against it.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 145. The dissent reasoned that the final sentence of \u00a7 113(f)(1), the saving clause, clarified that the federal common-law right to contribution survived the enactment of \u00a7 113(f)(1), even absent a \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a) civil action. <i>Id.,</i> at 148-150 (opinion of Wiener, J.).</p>\n<p>On rehearing en banc, the Fifth Circuit reversed by a divided vote, holding that \u00a7 113(f)(1) allows a PRP to obtain contribution from other PRPs regardless of whether the PRP has been sued under \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107. 312 F. 3d 677 (2002). The court held that \"[s]ection 113(f)(1) authorizes suits against PRPs in both its first and last sentence[,] which states without qualification that `nothing' in the section shall `diminish' any person's right to bring a contribution action in the absence of a section 106 or section 107(a) action.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 681. The court reasoned in part that \"may\" in \u00a7 113(f)(1) did not mean \"may only.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 686-687. Three members of the en banc court dissented for essentially the reasons given by the panel majority. <i>Id.,</i> at 691-693 (opinion of Garza, J.). We granted certiorari, 540 U. S. 1099 (2004), and now reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Section 113(f)(1) does not authorize Aviall's suit. The first sentence, the enabling clause that establishes the right <span class=\"star-pagination\">*166</span> of contribution, provides: \"Any person <i>may</i> seek contribution . . . <i>during or following</i> any civil action under section 9606 of this title or under section 9607(a) of this title,\" 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 9613(f)(1) (emphasis added). The natural meaning of this sentence is that contribution may only be sought subject to the specified conditions, namely, \"during or following\" a specified civil action.</p>\n<p>Aviall answers that \"may\" should be read permissively, such that \"during or following\" a civil action is one, but not the exclusive, instance in which a person may seek contribution. We disagree. First, as just noted, the natural meaning of \"may\" in the context of the enabling clause is that it authorizes certain contribution actions\u0097ones that satisfy the subsequent specified condition\u0097and no others.</p>\n<p>Second, and relatedly, if \u00a7 113(f)(1) were read to authorize contribution actions at any time, regardless of the existence of a \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a) civil action, then Congress need not have included the explicit \"during or following\" condition. In other words, Aviall's reading would render part of the statute entirely superfluous, something we are loath to do. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Hibbs</i> v. <i>Winn,</i> 542 U. S. 88, 101 (2004). Likewise, if \u00a7 113(f)(1) authorizes contribution actions at any time, \u00a7 113(f)(3)(B), which permits contribution actions after settlement, is equally superfluous. There is no reason why Congress would bother to specify conditions under which a person may bring a contribution claim, and at the same time allow contribution actions absent those conditions.</p>\n<p>The last sentence of \u00a7 113(f)(1), the saving clause, does not change our conclusion. That sentence provides: \"Nothing in this subsection shall diminish the right of any person to bring an action for contribution in the absence of a civil action under section 9606 of this title or section 9607 of this title.\" 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 9613(f)(1). The sole function of the sentence is to clarify that \u00a7 113(f)(1) does nothing to \"diminish\" any cause(s) of action for contribution that may exist independently of \u00a7 113(f)(1). In other words, the sentence rebuts <span class=\"star-pagination\">*167</span> any presumption that the express right of contribution provided by the enabling clause is the exclusive cause of action for contribution available to a PRP. The sentence, however, does not itself establish a cause of action; nor does it expand \u00a7 113(f)(1) to authorize contribution actions not brought \"during or following\" a \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a) civil action; nor does it specify what causes of action for contribution, if any, exist outside \u00a7 113(f)(1). Reading the saving clause to authorize \u00a7 113(f)(1) contribution actions not just \"during or following\" a civil action, but also before such an action, would again violate the settled rule that we must, if possible, construe a statute to give every word some operative effect. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Nordic Village, Inc.,</i> 503 U. S. 30, 35-36 (1992).</p>\n<p>Our conclusion follows not simply from \u00a7 113(f)(1) itself, but also from the whole of \u00a7 113. As noted above, \u00a7 113 provides two express avenues for contribution: \u00a7 113(f)(1) (\"during or following\" specified civil actions) and \u00a7 113(f)(3)(B) (after an administrative or judicially approved settlement that resolves liability to the United States or a State). Section 113(g)(3) then provides two corresponding 3-year limitations periods for contribution actions, one beginning at the date of judgment, \u00a7 113(g)(3)(A), and one beginning at the date of settlement, \u00a7 113(g)(3)(B). Notably absent from \u00a7 113(g)(3) is any provision for starting the limitations period if a judgment or settlement never occurs, as is the case with a purely voluntary cleanup. The lack of such a provision supports the conclusion that, to assert a contribution claim under \u00a7 113(f), a party must satisfy the conditions of either \u00a7 113(f)(1) or \u00a7 113(f)(3)(B).</p>\n<p>Each side insists that the purpose of CERCLA bolsters its reading of \u00a7 113(f)(1). Given the clear meaning of the text, there is no need to resolve this dispute or to consult the purpose of CERCLA at all. As we have said: \"[I]t is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\" <i>Oncale</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*168</span> v. <i>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</i> 523 U. S. 75, 79 (1998). Section 113(f)(1), 100 Stat. 1647, authorizes contribution claims only \"during or following\" a civil action under \u00a7 106 or \u00a7 107(a), and it is undisputed that Aviall has never been subject to such an action.<sup>[5]</sup> Aviall therefore has no \u00a7 113(f)(1) claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Aviall and <i>amicus</i> Lockheed Martin contend that, in the alternative to an action for contribution under \u00a7 113(f)(1), Aviall may recover costs under \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) even though it is a PRP. The dissent would have us so hold. We decline to address the issue. Neither the District Court, nor the Fifth Circuit panel, nor the Fifth Circuit sitting en banc considered Aviall's \u00a7 107 claim. In fact, as noted above, Aviall included separate \u00a7 107 and \u00a7 113 claims in its original complaint, but then asserted a \"combined\" \u00a7 107/\u00a7 113 claim in its amended complaint. The District Court took this consolidated claim to mean that Aviall was relying on \u00a7 107 \"not as an independent cause of action,\" but only \"to the extent necessary to maintain a viable \u00a7 113(f)(1) contribution claim.\" Civ. Action No. 3:97-CV-1926-D (ND Tex., Jan. 13, 2000), App. to Pet. for Cert. 94a, n. 2. Consequently the court saw no need to address any freestanding \u00a7 107 claim. The Fifth Circuit panel likewise concluded that Aviall no longer advanced a standalone \u00a7 107 claim. 263 F. 3d, at 137, n. 2. The en banc court found it unnecessary to decide whether Aviall had waived the \u00a7 107 claim, because it held that Aviall could rely instead on \u00a7 113. 312 F. 3d, at 685, n. 15. Thus, the court did not address the waiver issue, let alone the merits of the \u00a7 107 claim.</p>\n<p>\"We ordinarily do not decide in the first instance issues not decided below.\" <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Mineta,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*169</span> 534 U. S. 103, 109 (2001) (<i>per curiam</i>) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although we have deviated from this rule in exceptional circumstances, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Mendenhall,</i> 446 U. S. 544, 551-552, n. 5 (1980), the circumstances here cut <i>against</i> resolving the \u00a7 107 claim. Both the question whether Aviall has waived this claim and the underlying \u00a7 107 question (if it is not waived) may depend in part on the relationship between \u00a7\u00a7 107 and 113. That relationship is a significant issue in its own right. It is also well beyond the scope of the briefing and, indeed, the question presented, which asks simply whether a private party \"may bring an action seeking contribution pursuant to CERCLA Section 113(f)(1).\" Pet. for Cert. i. The \u00a7 107 claim and the preliminary waiver question merit full consideration by the courts below.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the parties cite numerous decisions of the Courts of Appeals as holding that a private party that is itself a PRP may not pursue a \u00a7 107(a) action against other PRPs for joint and several liability. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Bedford Affiliates</i> v. <i>Sills,</i> 156 F. 3d 416, 423-424 (CA2 1998); <i>Centerior Serv. Co.</i> v. <i>Acme Scrap Iron &amp; Metal Corp.,</i> 153 F. 3d 344, 349-356 (CA6 1998); <i>Pneumo Abex Corp.</i> v. <i>High Point, T &amp; D. R. Co.,</i> 142 F. 3d 769, 776 (CA4 1998); <i>Pinal Creek Group</i> v. <i>Newmont Mining Corp.,</i> 118 F. 3d 1298, 1301-1306 (CA9 1997); <i>New Castle County</i> v. <i>Halliburton NUS Corp.,</i> 111 F. 3d 1116, 1120-1124 (CA3 1997); <i>Redwing Carriers, Inc.</i> v. <i>Saraland Apartments,</i> 94 F. 3d 1489, 1496, and n. 7 (CA11 1996); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Colorado &amp; E. R. Co.,</i> 50 F. 3d 1530, 1534-1536 (CA10 1995); <i>United Technologies Corp.</i> v. <i>Browning-Ferris Industries,</i> 33 F. 3d 96, 98-103 (CA1 1994). To hold here that Aviall may pursue a \u00a7 107 action, we would have to consider whether these decisions are correct, an issue that Aviall has flagged but not briefed. And we might have to consider other issues, also not briefed, such as whether Aviall, which seeks to recover the share of its cleanup costs fairly chargeable to Cooper, may pursue a \u00a7 107 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*170</span> cost recovery action for some form of liability other than joint and several. We think it more prudent to withhold judgment on these matters.</p>\n<p>In view of the importance of the \u00a7 107 issue and the absence of briefing and decisions by the courts below, we are not prepared\u0097as the dissent would have it\u0097to resolve the \u00a7 107 question solely on the basis of dictum in <i>Key Tronic.</i> We held there that certain attorney's fees were not \"`necessary costs of response'\" within the meaning of \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B). 511 U. S., at 818-821. But we did not address the relevance, if any, of Key Tronic's status as a PRP or confront the relationship between \u00a7\u00a7 107 and 113. In discussing \u00a7 107, we did not even classify it precisely as a right of cost recovery or a right of contribution, as the dissent's descriptions of the decision reveal. <i>Post,</i> at 172 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.) (describing <i>Key Tronic</i> as recognizing a right to \"`seek recovery of cleanup costs'\" (quoting 511 U. S., at 818), but in the following paragraph saying that <i>Key Tronic</i> identified a \"right to contribution\"). \"Questions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents.\" <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Fall,</i> 266 U. S. 507, 511 (1925). Aviall itself recognizes the need for fuller examination of the \u00a7 107 claim; it has simply requested that we remand for consideration of that claim, not that we resolve the claim in the first instance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>In addition to leaving open whether Aviall may seek cost recovery under \u00a7 107, Part III-B, <i>supra,</i> we decline to decide whether Aviall has an implied right to contribution under \u00a7 107. Portions of the Fifth Circuit's opinion below might be taken to endorse the latter cause of action, 312 F. 3d, at 687; others appear to reserve the question whether such a cause of action exists, <i>id.,</i> at 685, n. 15. To the extent that Aviall chooses to frame its \u00a7 107 claim on remand as an implied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*171</span> right of contribution (as opposed to a right of cost recovery),<sup>[6]</sup> we note that this Court has visited the subject of implied rights of contribution before. See <i>Texas Industries,</i> 451 U. S., at 638-647; <i>Northwest Airlines,</i> 451 U. S., at 90-99. We also note that, in enacting \u00a7 113(f)(1), Congress explicitly recognized a particular set (claims \"during or following\" the specified civil actions) of the contribution rights previously implied by courts from provisions of CERCLA and the common law. Cf. <i>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Lewis,</i> 444 U. S. 11, 19 (1979). Nonetheless, we need not and do not decide today whether any judicially implied right of contribution survived the passage of SARA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>We hold only that \u00a7 113(f)(1) does not support Aviall's suit. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Aviall Services, Inc., purchased from Cooper Industries, Inc., property that was contaminated with hazardous substances. Shortly after the purchase, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission notified Aviall that it would institute enforcement action if Aviall failed to remediate the property. Aviall promptly cleaned up the site and now seeks reimbursement from Cooper. In my view, the Court unnecessarily defers decision on Aviall's entitlement to recover cleanup costs from Cooper.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*172</span> In <i>Key Tronic Corp.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 511 U. S. 809, 818 (1994), all Members of this Court agreed that \u00a7 107 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 9607, \"unquestionably provides a cause of action for [potentially responsible persons (PRPs)] to seek recovery of cleanup costs.\" The Court rested that determination squarely and solely on \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B), which allows <i>any</i> person who has incurred costs for cleaning up a hazardous waste site to recover all or a portion of those costs from any other person liable under CERCLA.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The <i>Key Tronic</i> Court divided, however, on the question whether the right to contribution is implicit in \u00a7 107(a)'s text, as the majority determined, or whether \u00a7 107(a) expressly confers the right, as the dissenters urged. The majority stated: Section 107 \"<i>implies</i>\u0097but does not expressly <i>command</i>\u0097that [a PRP] may have a claim for contribution against those treated as joint tortfeasors.\" 511 U. S., at 818, and n. 11 (emphasis added). The dissent maintained: \"Section 107(a)(4)(B) states, as clearly as can be, that `[c]overed persons . . . shall be liable for . . . necessary costs of response incurred by any other person.' Surely to say that A shall be liable to B is the <i>express</i> creation of a right of action.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 822. But no Justice expressed the slightest doubt that \u00a7 107 indeed did enable a PRP to sue other covered persons for reimbursement, in whole or part, of cleanup costs the PRP legitimately incurred.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*173</span> In its original complaint, Aviall identified \u00a7 107 as the federal-law basis for an independent cost-recovery claim against Cooper, and \u00a7 113 as the basis for a contribution claim. App. 8A, 16A-17A. In amended pleadings, Aviall alleged both \u00a7\u00a7 107 and 113 as the federal underpinning for its contribution claim. <i>Id.,</i> at 27A, 48A. Aviall's use of \u00a7\u00a7 113 and 107 in tandem to assert a contribution claim conformed its pleading to then-governing Fifth Circuit precedent, which held that a CERCLA contribution action arises through the joint operation of \u00a7\u00a7 107(a) and 113(f)(1). See <i>Geraghty &amp; Miller, Inc.</i> v. <i>Conoco Inc.,</i> 234 F. 3d 917, 924 (2000) (\"[W]hile section 113(f) is the vehicle for bringing a contribution action, it does not create a new cause of action or create any new liabilities. Rather, it is a mechanism for apportioning costs that are recoverable under section 107.\" (footnote omitted)). A party obliged by circuit precedent to plead in a certain way can hardly be deemed to have waived a plea the party could have maintained had the law of the circuit permitted him to do so. But cf. <i>ante,</i> at 168-169.</p>\n<p>In the Fifth Circuit's view, \u00a7 107 supplied the right of action for Aviall's claim, and \u00a7 113(f)(1) prescribed the procedural framework. 312 F. 3d 677, 683, and n. 10 (2002) (en banc) (stating that \u00a7 107 \"impliedly authorizes a cause of action for contribution\" and \u00a7 113(f) \"govern[s] and regulate[s]\" the action (citing <i>Geraghty &amp; Miller,</i> 234 F. 3d, at 924) (internal quotation marks omitted)); see \u00a7 113(f)(1) (calling for the governance of \"Federal law\" and the application of \"the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\" and specifying that \"[i]n resolving contribution claims, the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate\"). Notably, Aviall expressly urged in the Court of Appeals that, were the court to conclude that \u00a7 113(f)(1)'s \"during or following\" language excluded application of that section to this case, Aviall's suit should be adjudicated independently under \u00a7 107(a). See Response of Appellant Aviall Services, Inc., to the <i>Amicus</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*174</span> <i>Curiae</i> Brief for United States in No. 00-10197 (CA5), p. 24 (\"[P]arties who are excluded from seeking contribution under section 113(f)(1) must therefore have available to them the broader right of cost recovery [covering both full recovery and contribution] under section 107(a).\"); cf. <i>Key Tronic,</i> 511 U. S., at 816 (\"[T]he statute now expressly authorizes a cause of action for contribution in \u00a7 113 and impliedly authorizes a similar and somewhat overlapping remedy in \u00a7 107.\").</p>\n<p>I see no cause for protracting this litigation by requiring the Fifth Circuit to revisit a determination it has essentially made already: Federal courts, prior to the enactment of \u00a7 113(f)(1), had correctly held that PRPs could \"recover [under \u00a7 107] a proportionate share of their costs in actions for contribution against other PRPs,\" 312 F. 3d, at 687;<sup>[2]</sup> nothing in \u00a7 113 retracts that right, <i>ibid.</i> (noting that \u00a7 113(f)'s saving clause preserves all preexisting state and federal rights of action for contribution, including the \u00a7 107 implied right this Court recognized in <i>Key Tronic,</i> 511 U. S., at 816). Accordingly, I would not defer a definitive ruling by this Court on the question whether Aviall may pursue a \u00a7 107 claim for relief against Cooper.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging affirmance were filed for the State of New York et al. by <i>Eliot Spitzer,</i> Attorney General of New York, <i>Caitlin J.

Although Key Tronic settled a portion of its liability with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the claim advanced in Key Tronic's \u00a7 107(a) suit rested on remedial action taken before the EPA's involvement, remediation that did not figure in the settlement. <i>Id.,</i> at 1026-1027; <i>Key Tronic Corp.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 511 U.

S. 809, 814), or CERCLA &#167; 107(a) (which empowers the Government to recover its response costs from potentially responsible persons (PRPs)). Section 113(f)(1)'s saving clause provides: \"Nothing in this subsection shall diminish the right of any person to bring an action for contribution in the absence of a civil action under\" &#167; 106 or &#167; 107. SARA also created a separate express right of contribution, &#167; 113(f)(3)(B), for \"[a] person who has resolved its liability to the United States or a State for some or all of a response action or for some or all of the costs of such action in an administrative or judicially approved settlement.\"</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cooper Industries, Inc., owned four Texas properties until 1981, when it sold them to Aviall Services, Inc. After operating those sites for several years, Aviall discovered that both it and Cooper had contaminated them when hazardous substances leaked into the ground and ground water. Aviall notified the State of the contamination, but neither the State nor the Federal Government took judicial or administrative measures to compel cleanup. Aviall cleaned up the properties under the State's supervision and sold them to a third party, but remains contractually responsible for $5 million or more in cleanup costs. Aviall filed this action against Cooper to recover such costs. The original complaint asserted, <i>inter alia,</i> a claim for cost recovery under &#167; 107(a) and a separate claim for contribution under &#167; 113(f)(1). Aviall later amended the complaint to, among other things, combine its two CERCLA claims into a single, joint claim that, pursuant to &#167; 113(f)(1), sought contribution from Cooper as a PRP under &#167; 107(a). Granting Cooper summary judgment, the District Court held that Aviall had abandoned its freestanding &#167; 107 claim, and that contribution under &#167; 113(f)(1) was unavailable because Aviall had not been sued under &#167; 106 or &#167; 107. The Fifth Circuit ultimately reversed, holding that &#167; 113(f)(1) allows a PRP to obtain contribution from other PRPs regardless of whether the PRP has been sued under &#167; 106 or &#167; 107. The court reasoned in part that \"may\" in &#167; 113(f)(1)'s enabling clause did not mean \"may only.\"</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Held:</i> A private party who has not been sued under CERCLA &#167; 106 or &#167; 107(a) may not obtain contribution under &#167; 113(f)(1) from other liable parties. Pp. 165-171.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Section 113(f)(1) does not authorize Aviall's suit. This Court disagrees with Aviall's argument that the word \"may\" in &#167; 113(f)(1)'s enabling clause should be read permissively, such that \"during or following\" a civil action is one, but not the exclusive, instance in which a person may seek contribution. First, the natural meaning of \"may\" in this context is that it authorizes certain contribution actions that satisfy the subsequent specified condition&#8212;<i>i. e.,</i> those that occur \"during or following\" a specified civil action&#8212;and no others. Second, reading &#167; 113(f)(1) to authorize contribution actions at any time, regardless of the existence of a &#167; 106 or &#167; 107(a) civil action, would render entirely superfluous the section's explicit \"during or following\" condition, as well as &#167; 113(f)(3)(B), which permits contribution actions after settlement. This Court is loath to allow such a reading. See, <i>e.g., Hibbs</i> v. <i>Winn,</i> 542 U. S. 88, 101. Congress would not have bothered to specify conditions under which a person may bring a contribution claim, and at the same time allowed contribution actions absent those conditions. Section 113(f)(1)'s saving clause does not change the Court's conclusion. That clause's sole function is to clarify that &#167; 113(f)(1) does nothing to \"diminish\" any cause(s) of action for contribution that may exist independently of &#167; 113(f)(1), thereby rebutting any presumption that the express right of contribution provided by the enabling clause is the exclusive contribution cause of action available to a PRP. The saving clause, however, does not itself establish a cause of action, nor expand &#167; 113(f)(1) to authorize contribution actions not brought \"during or following\" a &#167; 106 or &#167; 107(a) civil action, nor specify what causes of action for contribution, if any, exist outside &#167; 113(f)(1). Reading the clause to authorize &#167; 113(f)(1) contribution actions not just \"during or following\" a civil action, but also before such an action, would again violate the settled rule that the Court must, if possible, construe a statute to give every word some operative effect. In light of provisions specifying two 3-year limitations periods for contribution actions beginning at the date of judgment, &#167; 113(g)(3)(A), and at the date of settlement, &#167; 113(g)(3)(B), the absence of any such provision for cases in which a judgment or settlement never occurs also supports the conclusion that, to assert a contribution claim under &#167; 113(f), a party must satisfy the conditions of either &#167; 113(f)(1) or &#167; 113(f)(3)(B). Given the clear meaning of CERCLA's text, there is no need to resolve the parties' dispute about CERCLA's purpose or to consult that purpose at all. See <i>Oncale</i> v. <i>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</i> 523 U. S. 75, 79. Because Aviall has never been subject to a civil action under &#167; 106 or &#167; 107(a), it has no &#167; 113(f)(1) claim. Pp. 165-168.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) The Court declines to address in the first instance Aviall's claim that it may recover costs under &#167; 107(a)(4)(B) even though it is a PRP. In view of the importance of the &#167; 107 issue, the question whether Aviall waived a freestanding &#167; 107 claim, and the absence of briefing and decisions by the courts below, this Court is not prepared to resolve the &#167; 107 question solely on the basis of dictum in <i>Key Tronic.</i> Pp. 168-170.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) In addition, the Court declines to decide whether Aviall has an implied right to contribution under &#167; 107. To the extent that Aviall chooses to frame its &#167; 107 claim on remand as an implied right of contribution (as opposed to a right of cost recovery), the Court notes that it has visited the subject before, see, <i>e.g., Texas Industries, Inc.</i> v. <i>Radcliff Materials, Inc.,</i> 451 U. S. 630, 638-647, and that, in enacting &#167; 113(f)(1), Congress explicitly recognized a particular set (claims \"during or following\" the specified civil actions) of the contribution rights previously implied by courts from provisions of CERCLA and the common law, cf. <i>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Lewis,</i> 444 U.

Section 113(f)(1) specifies that a party may obtain contribution \"during or following any civil action\" under CERCLA &#167; 106 or &#167; 107(a). The issue we must decide is whether a private party who has not been sued under &#167; 106 or &#167; 107(a) may nevertheless obtain contribution under &#167; 113(f)(1) from other liable parties. We hold that it may not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Under CERCLA, 94 Stat. 2767, the Federal Government may clean up a contaminated area itself, see &#167; 104, or it may compel responsible parties to perform the cleanup, see &#167; 106(a). See <i>Key Tronic Corp.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 511 U. S. 809, 814 (1994). In either case, the Government may recover its response costs under &#167; 107, 42 U. S. C. &#167; 9607 (2000 ed. and Supp. I), the \"cost recovery\" section of CERCLA. Section 107(a) lists four classes of potentially responsible persons (PRPs) and provides that they \"shall be liable\" for, among other things, \"all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the United States Government . . . not inconsistent with the national contingency plan.\" &#167; 107(a)(4)(A).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Section 107(a) further provides that PRPs shall be liable for \"any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the national contingency plan.\" &#167; 107(a)(4)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After CERCLA's enactment in 1980, litigation arose over whether &#167; 107, in addition to allowing the Government and certain private parties to recover costs from PRPs, also allowed a PRP that had incurred response costs to recover costs from other PRPs. More specifically, the question was whether a private party that had incurred response costs, but that had done so voluntarily and was not itself subject to suit, had a cause of action for cost recovery against other PRPs. Various courts held that &#167; 107(a)(4)(B) and its predecessors authorized such a cause of action. See, <i>e. g., Wickland Oil Terminals</i> v. <i>Asarco, Inc.,</i> 792 F. 2d 887, 890-892 (CA9 1986); <i>Walls</i> v. <i>Waste Resource Corp.,</i> 761 F. 2d 311, 317-318 (CA6 1985); <i>Philadelphia</i> v. <i>Stepan Chemical Co.,</i> 544 F.

As originally enacted in 1980, CERCLA contained no provision expressly providing for a right of action for contribution. A number of District Courts nonetheless held that, although CERCLA did not mention the word \"contribution,\" such a right arose either impliedly from provisions of the statute, or as a matter of federal common law. See, <i>e.g., United States</i> v. <i>New Castle County,</i> 642 F. Supp. 1258, 1263-1269 (Del. 1986) (contribution right arises under federal common law); <i>Colorado</i> v. <i>ASARCO, Inc.,</i> 608 F. Supp. 1484, 1486-1493 (Colo. 1985) (same); <i>Wehner</i> v. <i>Syntex Agribusiness, Inc.,</i> 616 F. Supp. 27, 31 (ED Mo. 1985) (contribution right is implied from &#167; 107(e)(2)). That conclusion was debatable in light of two decisions of this Court that refused to recognize implied or common-law rights to contribution in other federal statutes. See <i>Texas Industries, Inc.</i> v. <i>Radcliff Materials, Inc.,</i> 451 U. S. 630, 638-647 (1981) (refusing to recognize implied or common-law right to contribution in the Sherman Act or the Clayton Act); <i>Northwest Airlines, Inc.</i> v. <i>Transport Workers,</i> 451 U. S. 77, 90-99 (1981) (refusing to recognize implied or common-law right to contribution in the Equal Pay Act of 1963 or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress subsequently amended CERCLA in the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), 100 Stat. 1613, to provide an express cause of action for contribution, codified as CERCLA &#167; 113(f)(1):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Any person may seek contribution from any other person who is liable or potentially liable under section 9607(a) of this title, during or following any civil action under section 9606 of this title or under section 9607(a) of this title.

In resolving contribution claims, the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate.

Cooper Industries, Inc., owned and operated those sites until 1981, when it sold them to Aviall Services, Inc. Aviall operated the four sites for a number of years. Ultimately, Aviall discovered that both it and Cooper had contaminated the facilities when petroleum and other hazardous substances leaked into the ground and ground water through underground storage tanks and spills.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aviall notified the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (Commission) of the contamination. The Commission informed Aviall that it was violating state environmental laws, directed Aviall to clean up the site, and threatened to pursue an enforcement action if Aviall failed to undertake remediation.

Aviall sold the properties to a third party in 1995 and 1996, but remains contractually responsible for the cleanup. Aviall has incurred approximately $5 million in cleanup costs; the total costs may be even greater. In August 1997, Aviall filed this action against Cooper in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, seeking to recover cleanup costs. The original complaint asserted a claim for cost recovery under CERCLA &#167; 107(a), a separate claim for contribution under CERCLA &#167; 113(f)(1), and state-law claims. Aviall later amended the complaint, combining its two CERCLA claims into a single, joint CERCLA claim. That claim alleged that, pursuant to &#167; 113(f)(1), Aviall was entitled to seek contribution from Cooper, as a PRP under &#167; 107(a), for response costs and other liability Aviall incurred in connection with the Texas facilities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Aviall continued to assert state-law claims as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties moved for summary judgment, and the District Court granted Cooper's motion. The court held that Aviall, having abandoned its &#167; 107 claim, sought contribution only under &#167; 113(f)(1). The court held that &#167; 113(f)(1) relief was unavailable to Aviall because it had not been sued under CERCLA &#167; 106 or &#167; 107. Having dismissed Aviall's federal claim, the court declined to exercise jurisdiction over the state-law claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 263 F. 3d 134 (2001). The majority, relying principally on the \"during or following\" language in the first sentence of &#167; 113(f)(1), held that \"a PRP seeking contribution from other PRPs under &#167; 113(f)(1) must have a pending or adjudged &#167; 106 administrative order or &#167; 107(a) cost recovery action against it.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 145. The dissent reasoned that the final sentence of &#167; 113(f)(1), the saving clause, clarified that the federal common-law right to contribution survived the enactment of &#167; 113(f)(1), even absent a &#167; 106 or &#167; 107(a) civil action. <i>Id.,</i> at 148-150 (opinion of Wiener, J.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On rehearing en banc, the Fifth Circuit reversed by a divided vote, holding that &#167; 113(f)(1) allows a PRP to obtain contribution from other PRPs regardless of whether the PRP has been sued under &#167; 106 or &#167; 107. 312 F. 3d 677 (2002). The court held that \"[s]ection 113(f)(1) authorizes suits against PRPs in both its first and last sentence[,] which states without qualification that `nothing' in the section shall `diminish' any person's right to bring a contribution action in the absence of a section 106 or section 107(a) action.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 681. The court reasoned in part that \"may\" in &#167; 113(f)(1) did not mean \"may only.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 686-687. Three members of the en banc court dissented for essentially the reasons given by the panel majority. <i>Id.,</i> at 691-693 (opinion of Garza, J.). We granted certiorari, 540 U.

The first sentence, the enabling clause that establishes the right of contribution, provides: \"Any person <i>may</i> seek contribution . . . <i>during or following</i> any civil action under section 9606 of this title or under section 9607(a) of this title,\" 42 U. S. C. &#167; 9613(f)(1) (emphasis added). The natural meaning of this sentence is that contribution may only be sought subject to the specified conditions, namely, \"during or following\" a specified civil action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aviall answers that \"may\" should be read permissively, such that \"during or following\" a civil action is one, but not the exclusive, instance in which a person may seek contribution. We disagree. First, as just noted, the natural meaning of \"may\" in the context of the enabling clause is that it authorizes certain contribution actions&#8212;ones that satisfy the subsequent specified condition&#8212;and no others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, and relatedly, if &#167; 113(f)(1) were read to authorize contribution actions at any time, regardless of the existence of a &#167; 106 or &#167; 107(a) civil action, then Congress need not have included the explicit \"during or following\" condition. In other words, Aviall's reading would render part of the statute entirely superfluous, something we are loath to do. See, <i>e. g., Hibbs</i> v. <i>Winn,</i> 542 U. S. 88, 101 (2004). Likewise, if &#167; 113(f)(1) authorizes contribution actions at any time, &#167; 113(f)(3)(B), which permits contribution actions after settlement, is equally superfluous. There is no reason why Congress would bother to specify conditions under which a person may bring a contribution claim, and at the same time allow contribution actions absent those conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last sentence of &#167; 113(f)(1), the saving clause, does not change our conclusion. That sentence provides: \"Nothing in this subsection shall diminish the right of any person to bring an action for contribution in the absence of a civil action under section 9606 of this title or section 9607 of this title.\" 42 U. S. C. &#167; 9613(f)(1). The sole function of the sentence is to clarify that &#167; 113(f)(1) does nothing to \"diminish\" any cause(s) of action for contribution that may exist independently of &#167; 113(f)(1). In other words, the sentence rebuts any presumption that the express right of contribution provided by the enabling clause is the exclusive cause of action for contribution available to a PRP. The sentence, however, does not itself establish a cause of action; nor does it expand &#167; 113(f)(1) to authorize contribution actions not brought \"during or following\" a &#167; 106 or &#167; 107(a) civil action; nor does it specify what causes of action for contribution, if any, exist outside &#167; 113(f)(1). Reading the saving clause to authorize &#167; 113(f)(1) contribution actions not just \"during or following\" a civil action, but also before such an action, would again violate the settled rule that we must, if possible, construe a statute to give every word some operative effect. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Nordic Village, Inc.,</i> 503 U. S. 30, 35-36 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion follows not simply from &#167; 113(f)(1) itself, but also from the whole of &#167; 113. As noted above, &#167; 113 provides two express avenues for contribution: &#167; 113(f)(1) (\"during or following\" specified civil actions) and &#167; 113(f)(3)(B) (after an administrative or judicially approved settlement that resolves liability to the United States or a State). Section 113(g)(3) then provides two corresponding 3-year limitations periods for contribution actions, one beginning at the date of judgment, &#167; 113(g)(3)(A), and one beginning at the date of settlement, &#167; 113(g)(3)(B). Notably absent from &#167; 113(g)(3) is any provision for starting the limitations period if a judgment or settlement never occurs, as is the case with a purely voluntary cleanup. The lack of such a provision supports the conclusion that, to assert a contribution claim under &#167; 113(f), a party must satisfy the conditions of either &#167; 113(f)(1) or &#167; 113(f)(3)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each side insists that the purpose of CERCLA bolsters its reading of &#167; 113(f)(1). Given the clear meaning of the text, there is no need to resolve this dispute or to consult the purpose of CERCLA at all. As we have said: \"[I]t is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\" <i>Oncale</i> v. <i>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</i> 523 U. S. 75, 79 (1998). Section 113(f)(1), 100 Stat. 1647, authorizes contribution claims only \"during or following\" a civil action under &#167; 106 or &#167; 107(a), and it is undisputed that Aviall has never been subject to such an action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Aviall therefore has no &#167; 113(f)(1) claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aviall and <i>amicus</i> Lockheed Martin contend that, in the alternative to an action for contribution under &#167; 113(f)(1), Aviall may recover costs under &#167; 107(a)(4)(B) even though it is a PRP. The dissent would have us so hold. We decline to address the issue. Neither the District Court, nor the Fifth Circuit panel, nor the Fifth Circuit sitting en banc considered Aviall's &#167; 107 claim. In fact, as noted above, Aviall included separate &#167; 107 and &#167; 113 claims in its original complaint, but then asserted a \"combined\" &#167; 107/&#167; 113 claim in its amended complaint. The District Court took this consolidated claim to mean that Aviall was relying on &#167; 107 \"not as an independent cause of action,\" but only \"to the extent necessary to maintain a viable &#167; 113(f)(1) contribution claim.\" Civ. Action No. 3:97-CV-1926-D (ND Tex., Jan. 13, 2000), App. to Pet. for Cert. 94a, n. 2. Consequently the court saw no need to address any freestanding &#167; 107 claim. The Fifth Circuit panel likewise concluded that Aviall no longer advanced a standalone &#167; 107 claim. 263 F. 3d, at 137, n. 2. The en banc court found it unnecessary to decide whether Aviall had waived the &#167; 107 claim, because it held that Aviall could rely instead on &#167; 113. 312 F. 3d, at 685, n. 15. Thus, the court did not address the waiver issue, let alone the merits of the &#167; 107 claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We ordinarily do not decide in the first instance issues not decided below.\" <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Mineta,</i> 534 U.

Both the question whether Aviall has waived this claim and the underlying &#167; 107 question (if it is not waived) may depend in part on the relationship between &#167;&#167; 107 and 113. That relationship is a significant issue in its own right. It is also well beyond the scope of the briefing and, indeed, the question presented, which asks simply whether a private party \"may bring an action seeking contribution pursuant to CERCLA Section 113(f)(1).\" Pet. for Cert. i.

Co.</i> v. <i>Acme Scrap Iron &amp; Metal Corp.,</i> 153 F. 3d 344, 349-356 (CA6 1998); <i>Pneumo Abex Corp.</i> v. <i>High Point, T &amp; D. R. Co.,</i> 142 F. 3d 769, 776 (CA4 1998); <i>Pinal Creek Group</i> v. <i>Newmont Mining Corp.,</i> 118 F. 3d 1298, 1301-1306 (CA9 1997); <i>New Castle County</i> v. <i>Halliburton NUS Corp.,</i> 111 F. 3d 1116, 1120-1124 (CA3 1997); <i>Redwing Carriers, Inc.</i> v. <i>Saraland Apartments,</i> 94 F. 3d 1489, 1496, and n. 7 (CA11 1996); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Colorado &amp; E.

To hold here that Aviall may pursue a &#167; 107 action, we would have to consider whether these decisions are correct, an issue that Aviall has flagged but not briefed. And we might have to consider other issues, also not briefed, such as whether Aviall, which seeks to recover the share of its cleanup costs fairly chargeable to Cooper, may pursue a &#167; 107 cost recovery action for some form of liability other than joint and several. We think it more prudent to withhold judgment on these matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the importance of the &#167; 107 issue and the absence of briefing and decisions by the courts below, we are not prepared&#8212;as the dissent would have it&#8212;to resolve the &#167; 107 question solely on the basis of dictum in <i>Key Tronic.</i> We held there that certain attorney's fees were not \"`necessary costs of response'\" within the meaning of &#167; 107(a)(4)(B). 511 U. S., at 818-821. But we did not address the relevance, if any, of Key Tronic's status as a PRP or confront the relationship between &#167;&#167; 107 and 113. In discussing &#167; 107, we did not even classify it precisely as a right of cost recovery or a right of contribution, as the dissent's descriptions of the decision reveal. <i>Post,</i> at 172 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.) (describing <i>Key Tronic</i> as recognizing a right to \"`seek recovery of cleanup costs'\" (quoting 511 U. S., at 818), but in the following paragraph saying that <i>Key Tronic</i> identified a \"right to contribution\"). \"Questions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents.\" <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Fall,</i> 266 U. S. 507, 511 (1925). Aviall itself recognizes the need for fuller examination of the &#167; 107 claim; it has simply requested that we remand for consideration of that claim, not that we resolve the claim in the first instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to leaving open whether Aviall may seek cost recovery under &#167; 107, Part III-B, <i>supra,</i> we decline to decide whether Aviall has an implied right to contribution under &#167; 107. Portions of the Fifth Circuit's opinion below might be taken to endorse the latter cause of action, 312 F. 3d, at 687; others appear to reserve the question whether such a cause of action exists, <i>id.,</i> at 685, n. 15. To the extent that Aviall chooses to frame its &#167; 107 claim on remand as an implied right of contribution (as opposed to a right of cost recovery),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> we note that this Court has visited the subject of implied rights of contribution before. See <i>Texas Industries,</i> 451 U. S., at 638-647; <i>Northwest Airlines,</i> 451 U. S., at 90-99. We also note that, in enacting &#167; 113(f)(1), Congress explicitly recognized a particular set (claims \"during or following\" the specified civil actions) of the contribution rights previously implied by courts from provisions of CERCLA and the common law. Cf. <i>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Lewis,</i> 444 U. S. 11, 19 (1979). Nonetheless, we need not and do not decide today whether any judicially implied right of contribution survived the passage of SARA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold only that &#167; 113(f)(1) does not support Aviall's suit.

Shortly after the purchase, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission notified Aviall that it would institute enforcement action if Aviall failed to remediate the property.

C. &#167; 9607, \"unquestionably provides a cause of action for [potentially responsible persons (PRPs)] to seek recovery of cleanup costs.\" The Court rested that determination squarely and solely on &#167; 107(a)(4)(B), which allows <i>any</i> person who has incurred costs for cleaning up a hazardous waste site to recover all or a portion of those costs from any other person liable under CERCLA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Key Tronic</i> Court divided, however, on the question whether the right to contribution is implicit in &#167; 107(a)'s text, as the majority determined, or whether &#167; 107(a) expressly confers the right, as the dissenters urged. The majority stated: Section 107 \"<i>implies</i>&#8212;but does not expressly <i>command</i>&#8212;that [a PRP] may have a claim for contribution against those treated as joint tortfeasors.\" 511 U. S., at 818, and n. 11 (emphasis added). The dissent maintained: \"Section 107(a)(4)(B) states, as clearly as can be, that `[c]overed persons . . . shall be liable for . . . necessary costs of response incurred by any other person.' Surely to say that A shall be liable to B is the <i>express</i> creation of a right of action.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 822. But no Justice expressed the slightest doubt that &#167; 107 indeed did enable a PRP to sue other covered persons for reimbursement, in whole or part, of cleanup costs the PRP legitimately incurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its original complaint, Aviall identified &#167; 107 as the federal-law basis for an independent cost-recovery claim against Cooper, and &#167; 113 as the basis for a contribution claim. App. 8A, 16A-17A. In amended pleadings, Aviall alleged both &#167;&#167; 107 and 113 as the federal underpinning for its contribution claim. <i>Id.,</i> at 27A, 48A. Aviall's use of &#167;&#167; 113 and 107 in tandem to assert a contribution claim conformed its pleading to then-governing Fifth Circuit precedent, which held that a CERCLA contribution action arises through the joint operation of &#167;&#167; 107(a) and 113(f)(1). See <i>Geraghty &amp; Miller, Inc.</i> v. <i>Conoco Inc.,</i> 234 F. 3d 917, 924 (2000) (\"[W]hile section 113(f) is the vehicle for bringing a contribution action, it does not create a new cause of action or create any new liabilities. Rather, it is a mechanism for apportioning costs that are recoverable under section 107.\" (footnote omitted)). A party obliged by circuit precedent to plead in a certain way can hardly be deemed to have waived a plea the party could have maintained had the law of the circuit permitted him to do so. But cf. <i>ante,</i> at 168-169.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the Fifth Circuit's view, &#167; 107 supplied the right of action for Aviall's claim, and &#167; 113(f)(1) prescribed the procedural framework. 312 F. 3d 677, 683, and n. 10 (2002) (en banc) (stating that &#167; 107 \"impliedly authorizes a cause of action for contribution\" and &#167; 113(f) \"govern[s] and regulate[s]\" the action (citing <i>Geraghty &amp; Miller,</i> 234 F. 3d, at 924) (internal quotation marks omitted)); see &#167; 113(f)(1) (calling for the governance of \"Federal law\" and the application of \"the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\" and specifying that \"[i]n resolving contribution claims, the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate\"). Notably, Aviall expressly urged in the Court of Appeals that, were the court to conclude that &#167; 113(f)(1)'s \"during or following\" language excluded application of that section to this case, Aviall's suit should be adjudicated independently under &#167; 107(a). See Response of Appellant Aviall Services, Inc., to the <i>Amicus</i> <i>Curiae</i> Brief for United States in No. 00-10197 (CA5), p. 24 (\"[P]arties who are excluded from seeking contribution under section 113(f)(1) must therefore have available to them the broader right of cost recovery [covering both full recovery and contribution] under section 107(a).\"); cf. <i>Key Tronic,</i> 511 U.
