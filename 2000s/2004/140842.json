Lynaugh,</i> 492 U. S. 302 (1989), and <i>Tennard</i> v. <i>Dretke,</i> 542 U. S. 274 (2004). Promptly after the Texas court entered its order, and only hours before his execution was scheduled, petitioner applied to this Court for a stay, which we granted. That was the second time this Court had stayed petitioner's scheduled execution. Because I recognize that granting a stay of execution is not without costs, I write to explain why I felt compelled to vote to grant it, and why I must now vote to deny petitioner's writ of certiorari.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the order entered by the Texas court, we had reason to doubt whether the court's decision was in fact based on adequate and independent state grounds.
