He had received no law library access while in jail before trial\u0097despite his repeated requests and court orders to the contrary\u0097and only about four hours of access during trial, just before closing arguments. (Of course, he had declined, as was his right, to be represented by a lawyer with unlimited access to legal materials.) The California courts rejected his argument that his restricted library access violated his Sixth Amendment rights. Once his sentence became final, he petitioned in Federal District Court for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The District Court denied relief, but the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that \"the lack of any pretrial access to lawbooks violated Espitia's constitutional right to represent himself as established by the Supreme Court in <i>Faretta</i> [v. <i>California,</i> 422 U.S. 806 (1975)].\" <i>Garcia Espitia</i> v. <i>Ortiz,</i> 113 Fed. Appx. 802, 804 (2004). The warden's petition for certiorari and respondent's motion for leave to proceed <i>in forma pauperis</i> are granted, the judgment below is reversed, and the case is remanded.</p>\n<p>A necessary condition for federal habeas relief here is that the state court's decision be \"contrary to, or involv[e] an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Neither the opinion below, nor any of the appellate cases it relies on, identifies a source in our case law for the law library access right other than <i>Faretta.</i> See <i>id.,</i> at 804 (relying on <i>Bribiesca</i> v. <i>Galaza,</i> 215 F.3d 1015, 1020 (CA9 2000) (quoting <i>Milton</i> v. <i>Morris,</i> 767 F. 2d 1443, 1446 (CA9 1985))); <i>ibid.</i> (\"<i>Faretta</i> controls this case\").</p>\n<p>The federal appellate courts have split on whether <i>Faretta,</i> which establishes a Sixth Amendment right to self-representation, implies a right of the <i>pro se</i> defendant to have access to a law library.
