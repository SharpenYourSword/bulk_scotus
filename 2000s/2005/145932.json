The applicants\u2014a member of the American\nLibrary Association referred to herein as \u201cJohn Doe,\u201d the\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, and the American Civil\nLiberties Union Foundation\u2014brought suit in district\ncourt, alleging that the nondisclosure provision set forth in\n18 U. S. C. \u00a72709(c) violates their First Amendment right\nto freedom of speech. The District Court granted the\napplicants\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction against\nenforcement of \u00a72709(c). A panel of the Second Circuit\ngranted the Government\u2019s motion to stay the District\nCourt\u2019s judgment pending an expedited appeal. The same\npanel denied the applicants\u2019 subsequent motion to vacate\nthe stay in light of changed circumstances. In view of the\ncharacter of the constitutional issue presented and the\nexpedited schedule ordered by the Court of Appeals, I deny\nthe application and grant the parties\u2019 accompanying mo\ntions for leave to file under seal.\n2                      DOE v. GONZALES\n\n                      Opinion in Chambers\n\n   Section 2709, as amended by the Uniting and Strength\nening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to\nIntercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (hereinafter\nPatriot Act), authorizes the Federal Bureau of Investiga\ntion (FBI) to \u201crequest the name, address, length of service,\nand local and long distance toll billing records of a person\nor entity\u201d if the FBI asserts in writing that the informa\ntion sought is \u201crelevant to an authorized investigation to\nprotect against international terrorism or clandestine\nintelligence activities . . . .\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a72709(b) (2000 ed.,\nSupp. II). The provision authorizes the FBI to issue such\nrequests to \u201celectronic communication service providers.\u201d\n\u00a72709(a) (2000 ed.). In this case, the FBI requested infor\nmation under this Section in the form of a \u201cNational Secu\nrity Letter\u201d (NSL). At issue in this case is \u00a72709(c), which\nprohibits the recipient of an NSL from disclosing that fact.\nIbid. (prohibiting \u201cdisclos[ure] to any person that the [FBI]\nhas sought or obtained access to information or records\nunder this section\u201d). The current debate over renewal of\nthe Patriot Act has spawned eight bills, currently pending\nbefore the Senate and the House of Representatives, pro\nposing various amendments and revisions to \u00a72709.\n   John Doe received an NSL demanding that it disclose\n\u201cany and all subscriber information, billing information[,]\nand access logs of any person or entity\u201d associated with a\nspecified Internet Protocol (IP) address during a specified\nperiod. The NSL tracked the language of \u00a72709 and in\ncluded the admonition that Doe was not to disclose that\nthe FBI had sought or obtained information from it. Doe\nbrought suit in district court, alleging that the gag im\nposed by \u00a72709(c) is an unlawful prior restraint on speech\nthat is causing irreparable harm by preventing Doe\u2019s\neffective participation in the current debate\u2014both in\nCongress and among the public\u2014regarding proposed\nrevisions to the Patriot Act.\n   The District Court granted Doe\u2019s motion for a prelimi\n                  Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2005)             3\n\n                      Opinion in Chambers\n\nnary injunction, holding that Doe demonstrated a sub\nstantial likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable\nharm in the absence of the relief sought. Emergency\nApplication to Vacate Stay, App. B, p. 9 (hereinafter Ap\nplication). The court determined that, as a \u201ccategorical\nprohibition on the use of any fora for speech, on all topics\ncovered by \u00a72709(c),\u201d the gag provision is a prior restraint\nand a content-based restriction on free speech. Id., at 12\u2013\n13. The District Court therefore concluded that the prohi\nbition on disclosure is permissible only if it satisfies strict\nscrutiny. Id., at 13. In its strict-scrutiny analysis, the\ncourt considered two Government interests the gag provi\nsion might serve: the Government\u2019s general interest in\nnational security and its particular interest in conducting\neffective counterterrorism investigations.        Id., at 15.\nWhile the District Court acknowledged the Government\u2019s\ngeneral interest in protecting national security and its\nexpertise in the area of counterterrorism, ibid., that court\nfound \u201cnothing in the record\u201d (which included classified\nand other sealed ex parte submissions) suggesting that the\nGovernment has a compelling interest in preventing dis\nclosure of Doe\u2019s identity. Id., at 17, and nn. 7\u20138.\n   The Government\u2019s argument invoked a \u201cmosaic theory\u201d:\nAlthough Doe\u2019s identity \u201cmay appear innocuous by itself, it\ncould still be significant to a terrorist organization when\ncombined with other information available to it.\u201d Id., at\n18. The District Court acknowledged that federal courts\nhave credited the mosaic concept in the Freedom of Infor\nmation Act (FOIA) context, but it noted that the instant\ncase is distinguishable in this respect: \u201cTh[e] difference\nbetween seeking to obtain information and seeking to\ndisclose information already obtained raises [the plain\ntiffs\u2019] constitutional interests in this case above the consti\ntutional interests held by a FOIA claimant.\u201d Id., at 19\n(quoting McGehee v. Casey, 718 F. 2d 1137, 1147 (CADC\n1983)). In any event, the court held, \u201cthe defendants\u2019\n4                    DOE v. GONZALES\n\n                     Opinion in Chambers\n\nconclusory statements that the mosaic argument is appli\ncable here, absent supporting facts, would not suffice to\nsupport a judicial finding to that effect.\u201d Application, App.\nB, at 19\u201320. The District Court noted in this regard that\nit had asked counsel for the Government at oral argument\nif he could confirm that there was, in fact, a \u201cmosaic\u201d in\nthis case\u2014i.e., whether there are in fact other pieces of\ninformation that, when combined with Doe\u2019s identity,\nwould hinder the investigation. Counsel could not so\nconfirm. Id., at 20.\n   The District Court did not \u201cquestion that national secu\nrity can be a compelling state interest, or that non\ndisclosure of [an] NSL recipient\u2019s identity could, in some\ncircumstances, serve that interest.\u201d Ibid.. It found, how\never, that the Government failed to show a compelling\ninterest in preventing disclosure in this case:\n    \u201cBased on the foregoing, including the sealed portion\n    about Doe, and what Doe is, the nature and extent of\n    information about the NSL that has already been dis\n    closed by the defendants, and the nature and extent of\n    the information that will not be disclosed, this court\n    concludes that . . . the government has not demon\n    strated a compelling interest in preventing disclosure\n    of the recipient\u2019s identity.\u201d Ibid. (footnote omitted).\n   The District Court concluded that, \u201c[e]specially in a\nsituation like the instant one, where the statute provides\nno judicial review of the NSL or the need for its non\ndisclosure provision, . . . the permanent gag provision . . .\nis not narrowly drawn to serve the government\u2019s broadly\nclaimed compelling interest of keeping investigations\nsecret.\u201d Id., at 22\u201323. The court also appraised \u00a72709(c)\nas \u201coverbroad as applied with regard to the types of infor\nmation that it encompasses.\u201d Id., at 23. It found\n\u00a72709(c)\u2019s ban \u201cparticularly noteworthy\u201d in light of the fact\nthat proponents of the Patriot Act have \u201cconsistently\n                 Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2005)            5\n\n                     Opinion in Chambers\n\nrelied on the public\u2019s faith [that the Government will]\napply the statute narrowly . . . .\u201d Id., at 26 (quoting Re\nmarks of Attorney General John Ashcroft, Protecting Life\nand Liberty (Memphis, Tenn., Sept. 18, 2003), available at\nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/archive/ag/speeches/2003/091803me\nmphisremarks.htm (as visited Oct. 7, 2005, and available\nin Clerk of Court\u2019s case file) (characterizing as \u201chysteria\u201d\nfears of the Executive\u2019s abuse of the increased access to\nlibrary records under the Patriot Act and stating that \u201cthe\nDepartment of Justice has neither the staffing, the time[,]\nnor the inclination to monitor the reading habits of Ameri\ncans. No offense to the American Library Association, but\nwe just don\u2019t care.\u201d).\n   Having thus concluded that \u00a72709(c) fails strict scru\ntiny, the court granted the applicants\u2019 motion for prelimi\nnary injunctive relief, but stayed its ruling until Septem\nber 20, 2005, to give the Government the opportunity to\n\u201cfile an expedited appeal and submit an application for a\nstay pending appeal.\u201d Application, App. B, at 29. The\nGovernment did just that, and on September 20 the Court\nof Appeals granted the Government\u2019s motion:\n    \u201cAlthough there is a question as to the likelihood of\n    [the Government\u2019s] success on the merits and some in\n    jury to [the applicants] if a stay is granted, the [Gov\n    ernment has] demonstrated that [it] will suffer ir\n    reparable harm and the public interest [will be]\n    significantly injured if a stay is not granted. The bal\n    ance of harms tilts in favor of [the Government]. Mo\n    hammed v. Reno, 309 F. 3d 95, 100 (CA2 2002). This\n    appeal is hereby expedited and the following briefing\n    schedule is in effect: [The Government\u2019s] brief shall\n    be filed no later than September 27, 2005; [the appli\n    cants\u2019] brief shall be filed no later than October 4,\n    2005; [the Government\u2019s] reply brief shall be filed no\n    later than October 10, 2005.\u201d Id., App. D.\n6                    DOE v. GONZALES\n\n                     Opinion in Chambers\n\n   Shortly after the Court of Appeals entered the stay, the\nparties learned that, through inadvertence, Doe\u2019s identity\nhad been publicly available for several days on the District\nCourt\u2019s Web site and on PACER, the electronic docket\nsystem run by the Administrative Office of the United\nStates Courts. Id., App. F., at 3\u20135 (decl. of Melissa Good\nman). The parties also learned that the media had cor\nrectly reported Doe\u2019s identity on at least one occasion.\nSee, e.g., Cowan, Librarians Must Stay Silent in Patriot\nAct Suit, Court Says, N. Y. Times, Sept. 21, 2005, at B2.\nThe applicants immediately moved to vacate the stay in\nlight of this information. The Court of Appeals denied the\nmotion, \u201con the ground that the additional circumstances\nrelied upon by [the movants] do not materially alter the\nbalance of harms . . . .\u201d Application, App. E. The appli\ncants then filed the instant emergency application, urging\nme, in my capacity as Circuit Justice, to vacate the stay\nand thereby allow Doe to contribute its first-hand account\nto the ongoing debate regarding proposed revisions to the\nPatriot Act.\n   In support of their plea for an immediate order lifting\nthe stay, the applicants stress that Doe seeks only to\nconfirm its identity as the recipient of an NSL. It does not\nseek to disclose the content of the NSL, nor does it seek to\ndisclose the date on which it was received. They point out\nthat, in another case bearing the same name involving a\nfacial challenge to \u00a72709, the Government argued that\ncourts should consider the constitutionality of the gag\nprovision on a case-by-case basis, \u201cgranting relief where\u2014\nbut only where\u2014it can be shown that the compelling\ngovernmental interest[s] underlying the non-disclosure\nrequirement are not in jeopardy.\u201d Id., App. B, at 18, quot\ning Defendants-Appellants\u2019 Reply Brief 25, in Gonzales v.\nDoe, No. 05\u20130570 (CA2 filed Feb. 3, 2005) (on appeal from\nDoe v. Ashcroft, 334 F. Supp. 2d 471 (SDNY 2004)). That\n                 Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2005)           7\n\n                     Opinion in Chambers\n\nis precisely what the District Court did here. The appli\ncants underscore this anomaly: Doe\u2014the only entity in a\nposition to impart a first-hand account of its experience\u2014\nremains barred from revealing its identity, while others\nwho obtained knowledge of Doe\u2019s identity\u2014when that cat\nwas inadvertently let out of the bag\u2014may speak freely on\nthat subject.\n   Although the applicants\u2019 arguments are cogent, I have\ntaken into account several countervailing considerations\nin declining to vacate the stay kept in place by the Second\nCircuit pending its disposition of the appeal. I am mind\nful, first, that \u201cinterference with an interim order of a\ncourt of appeals cannot be justified solely because [a Cir\ncuit Justice] disagrees about the harm a party may suffer.\u201d\nCertain Named and Unnamed Non-citizen Children v.\nTexas, 448 U. S. 1327, 1330\u20131331 (1980) (Powell, J., in\nchambers). Respect for the assessment of the Court of\nAppeals is especially warranted when that court is pro\nceeding to adjudication on the merits with due expedition.\nThe principal briefs have been filed and I anticipate that\nthe Court of Appeals will hear argument promptly and\nrender its decision with appropriate care and dispatch.\n   Also weighing in favor of keeping the stay in effect\npending the full airing the Second Circuit has ordered, the\nDistrict Court held unconstitutional\u2014as applied to the\nfacts of this case\u2014a provision of an Act of Congress. A\ndecision of that moment warrants cautious review. Fur\nther, the Government points out that the redacted version\nof the complaint, prepared in consultation with the Gov\nernment, identifies Doe as a member of the American\nLibrary Association. \u201cThe American Library Association,\u201d\nthe Government footnotes, \u201clobbies Congress on behalf of\nits members and is free to note that one of those members\nhas been served with an NSL.\u201d\n   In sum, the applicants have not shown cause so extraor\ndinary as to justify this Court\u2019s intervention in advance of\n8                   DOE v. GONZALES\n\n                   Opinion in Chambers\n\nthe expeditious determination of the merits toward which\nthe Second Circuit is swiftly proceeding.\n",

Id., at 20.\n   The District Court did not \u201cquestion that national secu\nrity can be a compelling state interest, or that non\ndisclosure of [an] NSL recipient\u2019s identity could, in some\ncircumstances, serve that interest.\u201d Ibid.. It found, how\never, that the Government failed to show a compelling\ninterest in preventing disclosure in this case:\n    \u201cBased on the foregoing, including the sealed portion\n    about Doe, and what Doe is, the nature and extent of\n    information about the NSL that has already been dis\n    closed by the defendants, and the nature and extent of\n    the information that will not be disclosed, this court\n    concludes that . . . the government has not demon\n    strated a compelling interest in preventing disclosure\n    of the recipient\u2019s identity.\u201d Ibid. (footnote omitted).\n   The District Court concluded that, \u201c[e]specially in a\nsituation like the instant one, where the statute provides\nno judicial review of the NSL or the need for its non\ndisclosure provision, . . . the permanent gag provision . . .\nis not narrowly drawn to serve the government\u2019s broadly\nclaimed compelling interest of keeping investigations\nsecret.\u201d Id., at 22\u201323. The court also appraised \u00a72709(c)\nas \u201coverbroad as applied with regard to the types of infor\nmation that it encompasses.\u201d Id., at 23. It found\n\u00a72709(c)\u2019s ban \u201cparticularly noteworthy\u201d in light of the fact\nthat proponents of the Patriot Act have \u201cconsistently\n                 Cite as: 546 U.

No offense to the American Library Association, but\nwe just don\u2019t care.\u201d).\n   Having thus concluded that \u00a72709(c) fails strict scru\ntiny, the court granted the applicants\u2019 motion for prelimi\nnary injunctive relief, but stayed its ruling until Septem\nber 20, 2005, to give the Government the opportunity to\n\u201cfile an expedited appeal and submit an application for a\nstay pending appeal.\u201d Application, App. B, at 29. The\nGovernment did just that, and on September 20 the Court\nof Appeals granted the Government\u2019s motion:\n    \u201cAlthough there is a question as to the likelihood of\n    [the Government\u2019s] success on the merits and some in\n    jury to [the applicants] if a stay is granted, the [Gov\n    ernment has] demonstrated that [it] will suffer ir\n    reparable harm and the public interest [will be]\n    significantly injured if a stay is not granted. The bal\n    ance of harms tilts in favor of [the Government]. Mo\n    hammed v. Reno, 309 F. 3d 95, 100 (CA2 2002). This\n    appeal is hereby expedited and the following briefing\n    schedule is in effect: [The Government\u2019s] brief shall\n    be filed no later than September 27, 2005; [the appli\n    cants\u2019] brief shall be filed no later than October 4,\n    2005; [the Government\u2019s] reply brief shall be filed no\n    later than October 10, 2005.\u201d Id., App. D.\n6                    DOE v. GONZALES\n\n                     Opinion in Chambers\n\n   Shortly after the Court of Appeals entered the stay, the\nparties learned that, through inadvertence, Doe\u2019s identity\nhad been publicly available for several days on the District\nCourt\u2019s Web site and on PACER, the electronic docket\nsystem run by the Administrative Office of the United\nStates Courts. Id., App. F., at 3\u20135 (decl. of Melissa Good\nman). The parties also learned that the media had cor\nrectly reported Doe\u2019s identity on at least one occasion.\nSee, e.g., Cowan, Librarians Must Stay Silent in Patriot\nAct Suit, Court Says, N. Y. Times, Sept. 21, 2005, at B2.\nThe applicants immediately moved to vacate the stay in\nlight of this information. The Court of Appeals denied the\nmotion, \u201con the ground that the additional circumstances\nrelied upon by [the movants] do not materially alter the\nbalance of harms . . . .\u201d Application, App. E. The appli\ncants then filed the instant emergency application, urging\nme, in my capacity as Circuit Justice, to vacate the stay\nand thereby allow Doe to contribute its first-hand account\nto the ongoing debate regarding proposed revisions to the\nPatriot Act.\n   In support of their plea for an immediate order lifting\nthe stay, the applicants stress that Doe seeks only to\nconfirm its identity as the recipient of an NSL. It does not\nseek to disclose the content of the NSL, nor does it seek to\ndisclose the date on which it was received. They point out\nthat, in another case bearing the same name involving a\nfacial challenge to \u00a72709, the Government argued that\ncourts should consider the constitutionality of the gag\nprovision on a case-by-case basis, \u201cgranting relief where\u2014\nbut only where\u2014it can be shown that the compelling\ngovernmental interest[s] underlying the non-disclosure\nrequirement are not in jeopardy.\u201d Id., App. B, at 18, quot\ning Defendants-Appellants\u2019 Reply Brief 25, in Gonzales v.\nDoe, No. 05\u20130570 (CA2 filed Feb. 3, 2005) (on appeal from\nDoe v.

The appli\ncants underscore this anomaly: Doe\u2014the only entity in a\nposition to impart a first-hand account of its experience\u2014\nremains barred from revealing its identity, while others\nwho obtained knowledge of Doe\u2019s identity\u2014when that cat\nwas inadvertently let out of the bag\u2014may speak freely on\nthat subject.\n   Although the applicants\u2019 arguments are cogent, I have\ntaken into account several countervailing considerations\nin declining to vacate the stay kept in place by the Second\nCircuit pending its disposition of the appeal. I am mind\nful, first, that \u201cinterference with an interim order of a\ncourt of appeals cannot be justified solely because [a Cir\ncuit Justice] disagrees about the harm a party may suffer.\u201d\nCertain Named and Unnamed Non-citizen Children v.\nTexas, 448 U. S. 1327, 1330\u20131331 (1980) (Powell, J., in\nchambers). Respect for the assessment of the Court of\nAppeals is especially warranted when that court is pro\nceeding to adjudication on the merits with due expedition.\nThe principal briefs have been filed and I anticipate that\nthe Court of Appeals will hear argument promptly and\nrender its decision with appropriate care and dispatch.\n   Also weighing in favor of keeping the stay in effect\npending the full airing the Second Circuit has ordered, the\nDistrict Court held unconstitutional\u2014as applied to the\nfacts of this case\u2014a provision of an Act of Congress. A\ndecision of that moment warrants cautious review. Fur\nther, the Government points out that the redacted version\nof the complaint, prepared in consultation with the Gov\nernment, identifies Doe as a member of the American\nLibrary Association. \u201cThe American Library Association,\u201d\nthe Government footnotes, \u201clobbies Congress on behalf of\nits members and is free to note that one of those members\nhas been served with an NSL.\u201d\n   In sum, the applicants have not shown cause so extraor\ndinary as to justify this Court\u2019s intervention in advance of\n8                   DOE v. GONZALES\n\n                   Opinion in Chambers\n\nthe expeditious determination of the merits toward which\nthe Second Circuit is swiftly proceeding.\n</pre>",
