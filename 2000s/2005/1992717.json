He was sentenced to death. The convictions and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and Smith's state petitions for postconviction relief proved unsuccessful.

Shortly thereafter, Smith asserted in briefing that he is mentally retarded and cannot, under <i>Atkins,</i> be executed. The Ninth Circuit ordered suspension of all federal habeas proceedings and directed Smith to \"institute proceedings in the proper trial court of Arizona to determine whether the state is prohibited from executing [Smith] in accordance with <i>Atkins.</i>\" App. to Pet. for Cert.
