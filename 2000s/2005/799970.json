S. C. \u00a7 12181 <i>et seq.,</i> applies to foreign-flag cruise ships in United States waters. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held Title III did not apply because of a presumption, which it sought to derive from this Court's case law, that, absent a clear indication of congressional intent, general statutes do not apply to foreign-flag ships. 356 F. 3d 641, 644-646 (2004). The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, on the other hand, has held that the ADA does apply to foreign-flag cruise ships in United States waters. See <i>Stevens v. Premier Cruises, Inc.,</i> 215 F. 3d 1237 (2000). We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 542 U. S. 965 (2004).</p>\n<p>Our cases hold that a clear statement of congressional intent is necessary before a general statutory requirement can interfere with matters that concern a foreign-flag vessel's internal affairs and operations, as contrasted with statutory requirements that concern the security and well-being of United States citizens or territory. While the clear statement rule could limit Title III's application to foreign-flag cruise ships in some instances, when it requires removal of physical barriers, it would appear the rule is inapplicable to many other duties Title III might impose. We therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that the ADA is altogether inapplicable to foreign vessels, and we remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*126</span> I</h2>\n<p>The respondent Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd. (NCL), a Bermuda corporation with a principal place of business in Miami, Florida, operates cruise ships that depart from, and return to, ports in the United States. The ships are essentially floating resorts. They provide passengers with staterooms or cabins, food, and entertainment. The cruise ships stop at different ports of call where passengers may disembark. Most of the passengers on these cruises are United States residents; under the terms and conditions of the tickets, disputes between passengers and NCL are to be governed by United States law; and NCL relies upon extensive advertising in the United States to promote its cruises and increase its revenues.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that the cruises are operated by a company based in the United States, serve predominantly United States residents, and are in most other respects United States-centered ventures, almost all of NCL's cruise ships are registered in other countries, flying so-called flags of convenience. The two NCL cruise ships that are the subject of the present litigation, the Norwegian Sea and the Norwegian Star, are both registered in the Bahamas.</p>\n<p>The petitioners are disabled individuals and their companions who purchased tickets in 1998 or 1999 for round-trip cruises on the Norwegian Sea or the Norwegian Star, with departures from Houston, Texas. Naming NCL as the defendant, the petitioners filed a class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas on behalf of all persons similarly situated. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief under Title III of the ADA, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability. The petitioners asserted that cruise ships are covered both by Title III's prohibition on discrimination in places of \"public accommodation,\" \u00a7 12182(a), and by its prohibition on discrimination in \"specified public transportation services,\" \u00a7 12184(a). Both provisions require covered entities to make \"reasonable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> modifications in policies, practices, or procedures\" to accommodate disabled individuals, \u00a7\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii), 12184(b)(2)(A), and require removal of \"architectural barriers, and communication barriers that are structural in nature,\" where such removal is \"readily achievable,\" \u00a7\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv), 12184(b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p>The District Court held that, as a general matter, Title III applies to foreign-flag cruise ships in United States territorial waters. Civ. Action No. H-00-2649 (SD Tex., Sept. 10, 2002), App. to Pet. for Cert. 35a. The District Court found, however, that the petitioners' claims regarding physical barriers to access could not go forward because the agencies charged with promulgating architectural and structural guidelines for ADA compliance (the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, the Department of Transportation, and the Department of Justice) had not done so for cruise ships. In these circumstances, the court held, it is unclear what structural modifications NCL would need to make. <i>Id.,</i> at 36a-42a. The District Court granted NCL's motion to dismiss the barrier-removal claims, but denied NCL's motion with respect to all the other claims. <i>Id.,</i> at 47a.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. It reasoned that our cases, particularly <i>Benz v. Compania Naviera Hidalgo, S. A.,</i> 353 U. S. 138 (1957), and <i>McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros de Honduras,</i> 372 U. S. 10 (1963), stand for the proposition that general statutes do not apply to foreign-flag vessels in United States territory absent a clear indication of congressional intent. 356 F. 3d, at 644 (\"[T]o apply domestic law to foreign vessels entering United States waters, there must be present the affirmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed\" (quoting <i>Benz, supra,</i> at 147 (internal quotation marks omitted))); 356 F. 3d, at 646 (<i>Benz</i> and <i>McCulloch</i> \"prohibit United States courts from applying domestic statutes to foreign-flagged ships without specific evidence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> of congressional intent\"). As Title III does not contain a specific provision mandating its application to foreign-flag vessels, the Court of Appeals sustained the District Court's dismissal of the petitioners' barrier-removal claims on this alternative ground and reversed the District Court on the remaining Title III claims. 356 F. 3d, at 650-651.</p>\n<p>The action was ordered dismissed for failure to state a claim, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6), before extensive discovery. We cannot then discuss the specific allegations in much detail but must confine our opinion to the relevant general principles. (On November 24, 2004, the responsible agencies finally did issue draft guidelines for large passenger vessels and a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. See 69 Fed. Reg. 69244, 69249. These developments are not dispositive of the legal question on which we granted certiorari, and we do not address how they might affect the ultimate resolution of the petitioners' claims.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination against the disabled in the full and equal enjoyment of public accommodations, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 12182(a), and public transportation services, \u00a7 12184(a). The general prohibitions are supplemented by various, more specific requirements. Entities that provide public accommodations or public transportation: (1) may not impose \"eligibility criteria\" that tend to screen out disabled individuals, \u00a7\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(i), 12184(b)(1); (2) must make \"reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when such modifications are necessary\" to provide disabled individuals full and equal enjoyment, \u00a7\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii), 12184(b)(2)(A); (3) must provide auxiliary aids and services to disabled individuals, \u00a7\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(iii), 12184(b)(2)(B); and (4) must remove architectural and structural barriers, or if barrier removal is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> not readily achievable, must ensure equal access for the disabled through alternative methods, \u00a7\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv)-(v), 12184(b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p>These specific requirements, in turn, are subject to important exceptions and limitations. Eligibility criteria that screen out disabled individuals are permitted when \"necessary for the provision\" of the services or facilities being offered, \u00a7\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(i), 12184(b)(1). Policies, practices, and procedures need not be modified, and auxiliary aids need not be provided, if doing so would \"fundamentally alter\" the services or accommodations being offered. \u00a7\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii)-(iii). Auxiliary aids are also unnecessary when they would \"result in an undue burden,\" \u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(iii). As we have noted, moreover, the barrier-removal and alternative access requirements do not apply when these requirements are not \"readily achievable,\" \u00a7\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv)-(v). Additionally, Title III does not impose non-discrimination or accommodation requirements if, as a result, disabled individuals would pose \"a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services,\" \u00a7 12182(b)(3).</p>\n<p>Although the statutory definitions of \"public accommodation\" and \"specified public transportation\" do not expressly mention cruise ships, there can be no serious doubt that the NCL cruise ships in question fall within both definitions under conventional principles of interpretation. \u00a7\u00a7 12181(7)(A)-(B), (I), (L), 12181(10). The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, nevertheless, held that Title III does not apply to foreign-flag cruise ships in United States waters because the statute has no clear statement or explicit text mandating coverage for these ships. This Court's cases, particularly <i>Benz</i> and <i>McCulloch,</i> do hold, in some circumstances, that a general statute will not apply to certain aspects of the internal operations of foreign vessels temporarily in United States waters, absent a clear statement. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> broad clear statement rule adopted by the Court of Appeals, however, would apply to every facet of the business and operations of foreign-flag ships. That formulation is inconsistent with the Court's case law and with sound principles of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>This Court has long held that general statutes are presumed to apply to conduct that takes place aboard a foreign-flag vessel in United States territory if the interests of the United States or its citizens, rather than interests internal to the ship, are at stake. See <i>Cunard S. S. Co. v. Mellon,</i> 262 U. S. 100, 127 (1923) (holding that the general terms of the National Prohibition Act apply to foreign-flag ships in United States waters because \"[t]here is in the act no provision making it [in]applicable\" to such ships); <i>Uravic v. F. Jarka Co.,</i> 282 U. S. 234, 240 (1931) (holding that \"general words\" should be \"generally applied\" and that therefore there is \"no reason for limiting the liability for torts committed [aboard foreign-flag ships in United States territory] when they go beyond the scope of discipline and private matters that do not interest the territorial power\"). The general rule that United States statutes apply to foreign-flag ships in United States territory is subject only to a narrow exception. Absent a clear statement of congressional intent, general statutes may not apply to foreign-flag vessels insofar as they regulate matters that involve only the internal order and discipline of the vessel, rather than the peace of the port. This qualification derives from the understanding that, as a matter of international comity, \"all matters of discipline and all things done on board which affec[t] only the vessel or those belonging to her, and [do] not involve the peace or dignity of the country, or the tranquility of the port, should be left by the local government to be dealt with by the authorities of the nation to which the vessel belonged.\" <i>Wildenhus's Case,</i> 120 U. S. 1, 12 (1887). This exception to the usual presumption, however, does not extend beyond <span class=\"star-pagination\">*131</span> matters of internal order and discipline. \"[I]f crimes are committed on board [a foreign-flag vessel] of a character to disturb the peace and tranquility of the country to which the vessel has been brought, the offenders have never by comity or usage been entitled to any exemption from the operation of the local laws.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The two cases in recent times in which the presumption against applying general statutes to foreign vessels' internal affairs has been invoked, <i>Benz</i> and <i>McCulloch,</i> concern labor relations. The Court held that the general terms of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 49 Stat. 449, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 151 <i>et seq.,</i> did not govern the respective rights and duties of a foreign ship and its crew because the NLRA standards would interfere with the foreign vessel's internal affairs in those circumstances. These cases recognized a narrow rule, applicable only to statutory duties that implicate the internal order of the foreign vessel rather than the welfare of American citizens. <i>McCulloch,</i> 372 U. S., at 21 (holding that \"the law of the flag state ordinarily governs the <i>internal affairs</i> of a ship\" (emphasis added)); see also <i>Benz,</i> 353 U. S., at 146-147. The Court held the NLRA inapplicable to labor relations between a foreign vessel and its foreign crew not because foreign ships are generally exempt from the NLRA, but because the particular application of the NLRA would interfere with matters that concern only the internal operations of the ship. In contrast, the Court held that the NLRA is fully applicable to labor relations between a foreign vessel and American longshoremen because this relationship, unlike the one between a vessel and its own crew, does not implicate a foreign ship's internal order and discipline. <i>Longshoremen v. Ariadne Shipping Co.,</i> 397 U. S. 195, 198-201 (1970).</p>\n<p>This narrow clear statement rule is supported by sound principles of statutory construction. It is reasonable to presume Congress intends no interference with matters that are primarily of concern only to the ship and the foreign state <span class=\"star-pagination\">*132</span> in which it is registered. It is also reasonable, however, to presume Congress does intend its statutes to apply to entities in United States territory that serve, employ, or otherwise affect American citizens, or that affect the peace and tranquility of the United States, even if those entities happen to be foreign-flag ships.</p>\n<p>Cruise ships flying foreign flags of convenience offer public accommodations and transportation services to over 7 million United States residents annually, departing from and returning to ports located in the United States. Large numbers of disabled individuals, many of whom have mobility impairments that make other kinds of vacation travel difficult, take advantage of these cruises or would like to do so. To hold there is no Title III protection for disabled persons who seek to use the amenities of foreign cruise ships would be a harsh and unexpected interpretation of a statute designed to provide broad protection for the disabled. \u00a7 12101. The clear statement rule adopted by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, moreover, would imply that other general federal statutes\u0097including, for example, Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 243, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000a <i>et seq.</i>\u0097would not apply aboard foreign cruise ships in United States waters. A clear statement rule with this sweeping application is unlikely to reflect congressional intent.</p>\n<p>The relevant category for which the Court demands a clear congressional statement, then, consists not of all applications of a statute to foreign-flag vessels but only those applications that would interfere with the foreign vessel's internal affairs. This proposition does not mean the clear statement rule is irrelevant to the ADA, however. If Title III by its terms does impose duties that interfere with a foreign-flag cruise ship's internal affairs, the lack of a clear congressional statement can mean that those specific applications of Title III are precluded. On remand, the Court of Appeals may need to consider which, if any, Title III requirements interfere <span class=\"star-pagination\">*133</span> with the internal affairs of foreign-flag vessels. As we will discuss further, however, Title III's own limitations and qualifications may make this inquiry unnecessary.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>The precise content of the category \"internal affairs\" (or, as it is variously denoted in the case law, \"internal order\" or \"internal operations\") is difficult to define with precision. There is, moreover, some ambiguity in our cases as to whether the relevant category of activities is restricted to matters that affect only the internal order of the ship when there is no effect on United States interests, or whether the clear statement rule further comes into play if the predominant effect of a statutory requirement is on a foreign ship's internal affairs but the requirement also promotes the welfare of United States residents or territory. We need not attempt to define the relevant protected category with precision. It suffices to observe that the guiding principles in determining whether the clear statement rule is triggered are the desire for international comity and the presumed lack of interest by the territorial sovereign in matters that bear no substantial relation to the peace and tranquility of the port.</p>\n<p>It is plain that Title III might impose any number of duties on cruise ships that have nothing to do with a ship's internal affairs. The pleadings and briefs in this case illustrate, but do not exhaust, the ways a cruise ship might offend such a duty. The petitioners allege the respondent charged disabled passengers higher fares and required disabled passengers to pay special surcharges, Plaintiffs' First Amended Original Complaint in No. H-00-2649 (SD Tex.), \u00b6 32, App. 15 (hereinafter Complaint); Brief for Petitioners 17-20; maintained evacuation programs and equipment in locations not accessible to disabled individuals, Complaint \u00b6 19, App. 12; Brief for Petitioners 21; required disabled individuals, but <span class=\"star-pagination\">*134</span> not other passengers, to waive any potential medical liability and to travel with a companion, <i>id.,</i> at 8, 17-18; and reserved the right to remove from the ship any disabled individual whose presence endangers the \"comfort\" of other passengers, <i>id.,</i> at 8, 20. The petitioners also allege more generally that the respondent \"failed to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, and procedures\" necessary to ensure the petitioners' full enjoyment of the services the respondent offered. Complaint \u00b6 30, App. 15. These are bare allegations, and their truth is not conceded. We express no opinion on the factual support for those claims. We can say, however, that none of these alleged Title III violations implicate any requirement that would interfere with the internal affairs and management of a vessel as our cases have employed that term.</p>\n<p>At least one subset of the petitioners' allegations, however, would appear to involve requirements that might be construed as relating to the internal affairs of foreign-flag cruise ships. These allegations concern physical barriers to access on board. For example, according to the petitioners, most of the cabins on the respondent's cruise ships, including the most attractive cabins in the most desirable locations, are not accessible to disabled passengers. Brief for Petitioners 17-18; Complaint \u00b6 16, App. 11. The petitioners also allege that the ships' coamings\u0097the raised edges around their doors\u0097make many areas of the ships inaccessible to mobility-impaired passengers who use wheelchairs or scooters. Brief for Petitioners 24. Removal of these and other access barriers, the petitioners suggest, may be required by Title III's structural barrier-removal requirement, \u00a7\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv), 12184(b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p>Although these physical barriers affect the passengers as well as the ship and its crew, the statutory requirement could mandate a permanent and significant alteration of a physical feature of the ship\u0097that is, an element of basic ship design <span class=\"star-pagination\">*135</span> and construction. If so, these applications of the barrier-removal requirement likely would interfere with the internal affairs of foreign ships. A permanent and significant modification to a ship's physical structure goes to fundamental issues of ship design and construction, and it might be impossible for a ship to comply with all the requirements different jurisdictions might impose. The clear statement rule would most likely come into play if Title III were read to require permanent and significant structural modifications to foreign vessels. It is quite a different question, however, whether Title III would require this. The Title III requirements that might impose permanent and substantial changes to a ship's architecture and design, are, like all of Title III's requirements, subject to the statute's own specific limitations and qualifications. These limitations may make resort to the clear statement rule unnecessary.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>Title III requires barrier removal if it is \"readily achievable,\" \u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv). The statute defines that term as \"easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense,\" \u00a7 12181(9). Title III does not define \"difficulty\" in \u00a7 12181(9), but use of the disjunctive\u0097\"easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense\"\u0097indicates that it extends to considerations in addition to cost. Furthermore, Title III directs that the \"readily achievable\" determination take into account \"the impact . . . upon the operation of the facility,\" \u00a7 12181(9)(B).</p>\n<p>Surely a barrier-removal requirement under Title III that would bring a vessel into non-compliance with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), Nov. 1, 1974, [1979-1980] 32 U. S. T. 47, T. I. A. S. No. 9700, or any other international legal obligation, would create serious difficulties for the vessel and would have a substantial impact <span class=\"star-pagination\">*136</span> on its operation, and thus would not be \"readily achievable.\" This understanding of the statute, urged by the United States, is eminently reasonable. Brief as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 27-28; ADA Title III Technical Assistance Manual III-1.2000(D) (Supp. 1994), available at http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/ada/taman3up.html (as visited May 31, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court's case file); 56 Fed. Reg. 45600 (1991). If, moreover, Title III's \"readily achievable\" exemption were not to take conflicts with international law into account, it would lead to the anomalous result that American cruise ships are obligated to comply with Title III even if doing so brings them into non-compliance with SOLAS, whereas foreign ships\u0097which unlike American ships have the benefit of the internal affairs clear statement rule\u0097would not be so obligated. Congress could not have intended this result.</p>\n<p>It is logical and proper to conclude, moreover, that whether a barrier modification is \"readily achievable\" under Title III must take into consideration the modification's effect on shipboard safety. A separate provision of Title III mandates that the statute's non-discrimination and accommodation requirements do not apply if disabled individuals would pose \"a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services,\" \u00a7 12182(b)(3). This reference is to a safety threat posed by a disabled individual, whereas here the question would be whether the structural modification itself may pose the safety threat. It would be incongruous, nevertheless, to attribute to Congress an intent to require modifications that threaten safety to others simply because the threat comes not from the disabled person but from the accommodation itself. The anomaly is avoided by concluding that a structural modification is not readily achievable within the meaning of \u00a7 12181(9) if it would pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*137</span> 3</h2>\n<p>Because Title III does not require structural modifications that would conflict with international legal obligations or pose any real threat to the safety of the crew or other passengers, it may well follow\u0097though we do not decide the question here\u0097that Title III does not require any permanent and significant structural modifications that interfere with the internal affairs of any cruise ship, foreign flag or domestic. If that is indeed the case, recourse to the clear statement rule would not be necessary.</p>\n<p>Cases may arise, however, where it is prudent for a court to turn first to the internal affairs clear statement rule rather than deciding the precise scope and operation of the statute. Suppose, for example, it is a difficult question whether a particular Title III barrier-removal requirement is readily achievable, but the requirement does entail a permanent and significant structural modification, interfering with a foreign ship's internal affairs. In that case a court sensibly could invoke the clear statement rule without determining whether Title III actually imposes the requirement. On the other hand, there may be many cases where it is not obvious that a particular physical modification relates to a vessel's basic architecture and construction, but it is clear the modification would conflict with SOLAS or some other international legal obligation. In those cases, a court may deem it appropriate to hold that the physical barrier modification in question is not readily achievable, without resort to the clear statement rule.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In light of the preceding analysis, it is likely that under a proper interpretation of \"readily achievable\" Title III would impose no requirements that interfere with the internal affairs of foreign-flag cruise ships. If Title III did impose a duty that required cruise ships to make permanent and significant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*138</span> structural modifications that did not conflict with international law or threaten safety, or if the statute otherwise interfered with a foreign ship's internal affairs, the clear statement rule recognized in <i>Benz</i> and <i>McCulloch</i> would come into play at that point. The Title III requirement in question, however, would still apply to domestic cruise ships, and Title III requirements having nothing to do with internal affairs would continue to apply to domestic and foreign ships alike.</p>\n<p>This application-by-application use of the internal affairs clear statement rule is consistent with how the rule has traditionally operated. In <i>Benz</i> and <i>McCulloch,</i> the Court concluded that the NLRA did not apply to labor relations between a foreign-flag ship and its foreign crew because of interference with the foreign ships' internal affairs. In <i>Ariadne Shipping,</i> however, the Court held that the NLRA does apply to labor relations between a foreign-flag ship and American longshoremen. <i>Ariadne Shipping</i> acknowledged the clear statement rule invoked in <i>Benz</i> and <i>McCulloch</i> but held that the \"considerations that informed the Court's construction of the statute in [those cases] are clearly inapplicable\" to the question whether the statute applies to foreign ships' labor relations with American longshoremen. 397 U. S., at 199. <i>Ariadne Shipping</i> held that the longshoremen's \"short-term, irregular and casual connection with the [foreign] vessels plainly belied any involvement on their part with the ships' `internal discipline and order.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 200. Therefore, application of the NLRA to foreign ships' relations with American longshoremen \"would have threatened no interference in the internal affairs of foreign-flag ships.\" <i>Ibid.</i> If the clear statement rule restricts some applications of the NLRA to foreign ships (<i>e. g.,</i> labor relations with the foreign crew), but not others (<i>e. g.,</i> labor relations with American longshoremen), it follows that the case-by-case application is also required under Title III of the ADA. The rule, where it is even necessary to invoke it, would restrict <span class=\"star-pagination\">*139</span> some applications of Title III to foreign ships (<i>e. g.,</i> certain structural barrier-modification requirements), but not others (<i>e. g.,</i> the prohibition on discriminatory ticket pricing).</p>\n<p>The internal affairs clear statement rule is an implied limitation on otherwise unambiguous general terms of the statute. It operates much like the principle that general statutes are construed not to apply extraterritorially, <i>EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co.,</i> 499 U. S. 244, 260 (1991), or the rule that general statutes are presumed not to impose monetary liability on non-consenting States, <i>Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon,</i> 473 U. S. 234 (1985). Implied limitation rules avoid applications of otherwise unambiguous statutes that would intrude on sensitive domains in a way that Congress is unlikely to have intended had it considered the matter. In these instances, the absence of a clear congressional statement is, in effect, equivalent to a statutory qualification saying, for example, \"Notwithstanding any general language of this statute, this statute shall not apply extraterritorially\"; or \". . . this statute shall not abrogate the sovereign immunity of non-consenting States\"; or \". . . this statute does not regulate the internal affairs of foreign-flag vessels.\" These clear statement rules ensure Congress does not, by broad or general language, legislate on a sensitive topic inadvertently or without due deliberation. An all-or-nothing approach, under which a statute is altogether inapplicable if but one of its specific applications trenches on the domain protected by a clear statement rule, would convert the clear statement rule from a principle of interpretive caution into a trap for an unwary Congress. If Congress passes broad legislation that has some applications that implicate a clear statement rule\u0097say, some extraterritorial applications, or some applications that would regulate foreign ships' internal affairs\u0097an all-or-nothing approach would require that the entire statute, or some arbitrary set of applications larger than the domain protected by the clear statement rule, would be nullified. We decline to adopt that posture.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*140</span> B</h2>\n<p>Our holding that the clear statement rule operates only when a ship's internal affairs are affected does not implicate our holding in <i>Clark v. Martinez,</i> 543 U. S. 371 (2005). <i>Martinez</i> held that statutory language given a limiting construction in one context must be interpreted consistently in other contexts, \"even though other of the statute's applications, standing alone, would not support the same limitation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 380. This was simply a rule of consistent interpretation of the statutory words, with no bearing on the implementation of a clear statement rule addressed to particular statutory applications.</p>\n<p>The statute in <i>Martinez,</i> 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1231(a)(6), authorized detention of aliens pending their removal. In <i>Zadvydas v. Davis,</i> 533 U. S. 678, 696-699 (2001), the Court had interpreted this statute to impose time limits on detention of aliens held for certain reasons stated in the statute. The Court held that an alternative interpretation, one allowing indefinite detention of lawfully admitted aliens, would raise grave constitutional doubts. Having determined the meaning of \u00a7 1231(a)(6)'s text in <i>Zadvydas,</i> we were obliged in <i>Martinez</i> to follow the same interpretation even in a context where the constitutional concerns were not present. <i>Martinez,</i> 543 U. S., at 377-381. As already made clear, the question was one of textual interpretation, not the scope of some implied exception. The constitutional avoidance canon simply informed the choice among plausible readings of \u00a7 1231(a)(6)'s text: \"The canon of constitutional avoidance,\" <i>Martinez</i> explained, \"comes into play only when, after the application of ordinary textual analysis, the statute is found to be susceptible of more than one construction; and the canon functions as a means of choosing between them.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 385 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p><i>Martinez</i> gives full respect to the distinction between rules for resolving textual ambiguity and implied limitations on otherwise unambiguous text. Indeed, <i>Martinez</i> relies on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*141</span> the distinction to reconcile its holding with two cases which did involve a clear statement rule, <i>Raygor v. Regents of Univ. of Minn.,</i> 534 U. S. 533 (2002), and <i>Jinks v. Richland County,</i> 538 U. S. 456 (2003). <i>Raygor</i> had held that the tolling provision in the supplemental jurisdiction statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1367(d), does not apply to non-consenting States because the statute lacks the required clear statement that States are within its coverage. Later, in <i>Jinks,</i> we held that the \u00a7 1367(d) tolling provision does apply to suits against counties. The counties were not protected by a clear statement rule analogous to the one applicable to States. See <i>Martinez,</i> 543 U. S., at 383, and n. 6; see also <i>id.,</i> at 393-394 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). \"This progression of decisions,\" we held in <i>Martinez,</i> \"does not remotely establish that \u00a7 1367(d) has two different meanings, equivalent to the unlimited-detention/limited-detention meanings of \u00a7 1231(a)(6) urged upon us here. They hold that the single and unchanging disposition of \u00a7 1367(d) . . . does not apply to claims against States that have not consented to be sued in federal court.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 383. The distinction between <i>Zadvydas</i> and <i>Martinez,</i> on the one hand, and <i>Raygor</i> and <i>Jinks,</i> on the other, is the distinction between a canon for choosing among plausible meanings of an ambiguous statute and a clear statement rule that implies a special substantive limit on the application of an otherwise unambiguous mandate.</p>\n<p>The internal affairs clear statement rule is an implied limitation rule, not a principle for resolving textual ambiguity. Our cases, then, do not compel or permit the conclusion that if any one application of Title III might interfere with a foreign-flag ship's internal affairs, Title III is inapplicable to foreign ships in every other instance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that general statutes do not apply to foreign-flag ships in United <span class=\"star-pagination\">*142</span> States waters. This Court's cases, however, stand only for the proposition that general statutes are presumed not to impose requirements that would interfere with the internal affairs of foreign-flag vessels. Except insofar as Title III regulates a vessel's internal affairs\u0097a category that is not always well defined and that may require further judicial elaboration\u0097the statute is applicable to foreign ships in United States waters to the same extent that it is applicable to American ships in those waters.</p>\n<p>Title III's own limitations and qualifications prevent the statute from imposing requirements that would conflict with international obligations or threaten shipboard safety. These limitations and qualifications, though framed in general terms, employ a conventional vocabulary for instructing courts in the interpretation and application of the statute. If, on remand, it becomes clear that even after these limitations are taken into account Title III nonetheless imposes certain requirements that would interfere with the internal affairs of foreign ships\u0097perhaps, for example, by requiring permanent and substantial structural modifications\u0097the clear statement rule would come into play. It is also open to the court on remand to consider application of the clear statement rule at the outset if, as a prudential matter, that appears to be the more appropriate course.</p>\n<p>We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court's holding that Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 covers cruise ships, <i>ante,</i> at 129, and allows them to resist modifications \"that would conflict with international legal obligations,\" <i>ante,</i> at 137 (plurality opinion). I therefore join Parts I, II-A-1, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*143</span> and II-B-2 of the Court's opinion. I would give no wider berth, however, to the \"internal affairs\" clear statement rule in determining Title III's application to respondent's cruise ships, the Norwegian Sea and Norwegian Star. But see <i>ante,</i> at 137. That rule, as I understand it, derives from, and is moored to, the broader guide that statutes \"should not be interpreted to regulate foreign persons or conduct if that regulation would conflict with principles of international law.\" <i>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California,</i> 509 U. S. 764, 815 (1993) (SCALIA, J., dissenting); see also <i>id.,</i> at 816 (describing <i>McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros de Honduras,</i> 372 U. S. 10 (1963), as applying this principle); <i>Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy,</i> 2 Cranch 64, 118 (1804). Title III is properly read to avoid such conflict, but should not be hemmed in where there is no potential for international discord.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The first of the modern cases to address the application of a domestic statute to a foreign-flag ship in U. S. waters, <i>Benz v. Compania Naviera Hidalgo, S. A.,</i> 353 U. S. 138 (1957), did not resort to the tag, \"internal affairs\" rule, to explain the Court's decision.<sup>[2]</sup><i>Benz</i> held that the Labor Management Relations Act did not reach relations between \"a foreign employer and a foreign crew operating under an agreement made abroad under the laws of another nation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 142. As we concluded in <i>Benz,</i> before reading our law to \"run interference in such a delicate field of international relations,\" \"where the possibilities of international discord are so evident and retaliative action so certain,\" the Court should await Congress' clearly expressed instruction <i>Id.,</i> at 147.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*144</span> Six years later, in <i>McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros de Honduras,</i> 372 U. S. 10 (1963), the Court relied on <i>Benz</i> to hold that the National Labor Relations Act does not regulate the representation of alien seamen recruited in Honduras to serve aboard vessels under Honduran flags. Applying our law \"to the internal management and affairs\" of the vessels in question, we observed, <i>McCulloch,</i> 372 U. S., at 20, would produce a \"head-on collision\" with the regulatory regime installed under the Honduran labor code, <i>id.,</i> at 21. \"[S]uch highly charged international circumstances,\" we said, called for adherence to the venerable interpretive guide that \"`an act of Congress ought never to be construed to violate the law of nations if any other possible construction remains.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Schooner Charming Betsy,</i> 2 Cranch, at 118). Cf. <i>Longshoremen v. Ariadne Shipping Co.,</i> 397 U. S. 195, 200 (1970) (applying U. S. law to foreign ships' labor relations with longshoreworkers employed at U. S. ports is proper because doing so \"would . . . threate[n] no interference in the internal affairs of foreign-flag ships likely to lead to conflict with foreign or international law\").</p>\n<p>The noninterference principle underlying the internal affairs clear statement rule is served in this case by the Court's interpretation of Title III's \"readily achievable\" provision, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv). See <i>ante,</i> at 135-136. Construing this language to allow ships to resist modifications \"that would conflict with international legal obligations,\" <i>ante,</i> at 137, the plurality ensures that Title III will not provoke \"international discord\" of the kind <i>Benz</i> and <i>McCulloch</i> sought to avoid. I agree with this interpretation, but would create no larger space for the internal affairs rule.</p>\n<p>The plurality, however, suggests that the clear statement rule has a further office: It may block structural modifications prompted by Title III that are \"readily achievable\"\u0097because they do not conflict with international legal obligations\u0097but nonetheless \"interfer[e] with a foreign ship's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*145</span> internal affairs.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 137. I disagree with this conception of the rule. In positing an extended application of the internal affairs rule, the plurality cuts the rule loose from its foundation. As <i>Benz</i> and <i>McCulloch</i> demonstrate, the clear statement rule is an interpretive principle counseling against construction of a statute in a manner productive of international discord. When international relations are not at risk, and there is good reason to apply our own law, asserted internal affairs of a ship should hold no greater sway than asserted management prerogatives of a landlocked enterprise.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>As the plurality rightly notes, Title III is a broad remedial statute designed to protect persons with disabilities in a variety of activities and settings. See <i>ante,</i> at 132; \u00a7 12101(b). The United States has a strong interest in ensuring that U. S. resident cruise passengers enjoy Title III's protections on both domestic and foreign ships. See \u00a7 12101; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 10.<sup>[4]</sup> Once conflicts with international legal obligations are avoided, I see no reason to demand a clearer congressional statement that Title III reaches the vessels in question, ships that regularly sail to and from U. S. ports and derive most of their income from U. S. passengers. In sum, I agree that \u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv), properly read, does not require shipowners to make modifications that would conflict with international legal obligations. But I would attribute to the internal affairs clear statement rule no further limitation on Title III's governance in this case.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*146</span> JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in part, dissenting in part, and concurring in the judgment in part.</p>\n<p>When a law regulates the internal order of ships, Congress must clearly express its intent to apply the law to foreign-flag ships. <i>Ante,</i> at 130-132 (plurality opinion); <i>post,</i> at 149-150 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). I agree with JUSTICE SCALIA that this rule applies to any structural changes to a ship that Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) might require, for such changes to a ship's physical structure pertain to its internal affairs. <i>Post,</i> at 151 (dissenting opinion); see <i>ante,</i> at 134-135 (plurality opinion). I further agree with JUSTICE SCALIA that this clear statement rule applies once the possibility, rather than the certainty, of international discord arises; and that the clear statement rule therefore does not require or permit the kind of express conflicts-of-law analysis that the plurality demands. <i>Post,</i> at 153-155 (dissenting opinion); <i>ante,</i> at 135-137 (majority opinion). Moreover, I do not think that courts should (as the plurality permits) employ the rule selectively, applying it when \"prudent\" but declining to apply it when \"appropriate.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 137 (plurality opinion); see also <i>post,</i> at 158, n. 8 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); <i>Small v. United States,</i> 544 U. S. 385, 405 (2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (\"Whatever the utility of canons as guides to congressional intent, they are useless when modified in ways that Congress could never have imagined\"). For those reasons, I join Part I-A of JUSTICE SCALIA'S dissent. While I conclude that the rule applies to certain aspects of Title III, I agree with the plurality that it does not require an \"all-or-nothing approach.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 139. Consequently, those applications of Title III that do not pertain to internal affairs apply to foreign-flag vessels. For that reason, I join Part III-A of the plurality opinion.</p>\n<p>I reach this result, however, only because I continue to reject the \"lowest common denominator\" principle the Court articulated for the first time in <i>Clark v. Martinez,</i> 543 U. S. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*147</span> 371 (2005). See <i>id.,</i> at 395-397 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). The plurality, by contrast, accepts <i>Clark.</i> Moreover, it claims that applying Title III of the ADA to matters that are not within the realm of a ship's internal order is consistent with <i>Clark.</i> The plurality's efforts to distinguish <i>Clark</i> are implausible.</p>\n<p>The plurality says that today's case differs from <i>Clark</i> because it invokes a clear statement rule to interpret unambiguous text. According to the plurality, <i>Clark</i> concerned the application of a previously adopted limiting construction of ambiguous text, which this Court imposed to ameliorate unrelated constitutional doubts. <i>Ante,</i> at 140-141. As an initial matter, however, the statute at issue in <i>Zadvydas v. Davis,</i> 533 U. S. 678 (2001), and <i>Clark</i> was not ambiguous. <i>Clark, supra,</i> at 402-403 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Even assuming for the sake of argument that it was ambiguous, the distinction the plurality draws has no basis in <i>Clark.</i> In <i>Clark,</i> this Court addressed the period of detention 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1231(a)(6) authorized for inadmissible aliens. This was a question left open by <i>Zadvydas, supra,</i> which had addressed the period of detention under the same statute but with respect to a different class of aliens\u0097those who had been admitted into the country. In <i>Zadvydas,</i> this Court had concluded that the possibility of indefinite detention of admitted aliens raised significant constitutional doubts and, in light of those doubts, it limited the Attorney General's power to detain admitted aliens. 533 U. S., at 689-690, 699. Section 1231(a)(6) does not distinguish between the two classes of aliens. Thus, this Court in <i>Clark</i> concluded it was compelled to apply that same construction, which was warranted only by the specific constitutional concerns arising for admitted aliens, to the unadmitted aliens before it. 543 U. S., at 378. <i>Clark</i>'s conclusion stemmed from the narrowing construction adopted in <i>Zadvydas,</i> not the type of rule or canon that gave rise to that construction. 543 U. S., at 377-378.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*148</span> The plurality's reasoning cannot be squared with <i>Clark</i>'s \"lowest common denominator\" principle. Under <i>Clark,</i> \"[t]he lowest common denominator, as it were, must govern.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 380. Just as in <i>Zadvydas</i> and <i>Clark,</i> this Court is called upon to interpret the same statutory text with respect to two different classes of cases\u0097those that implicate the internal affairs of a vessel and those that do not. And just like the statute at issue in <i>Zadvydas</i> and <i>Clark,</i> Title III \"applies without differentiation\" to the internal and external affairs of foreign-flag vessels, as well as the internal and external affairs of domestic-flag ships. 543 U. S., at 378. Thus, the limiting construction of Title III's definitions excluding foreign cruise ships from those definitions must govern <i>all</i> applications of the statute, not just those applications that pertain to internal affairs. According to <i>Clark,</i> the Court may not narrow Title III on a case-by-case basis, depending on whether a particular application of Title III interferes with a ship's internal order. In fact, it may not apply Title III to any ship or, for that matter, any entity at all, because Title III does not distinguish between any of the covered entities. This demonstrates why the principle <i>Clark</i> established is flawed.</p>\n<p>Today's decision, then, cabins the <i>Clark</i> principle to apply only when the canon of constitutional avoidance is invoked to choose among ambiguous readings of a statute. But even here <i>Clark</i> will continue to make mischief. As I explained in <i>Clark,</i> the lowest common denominator principle requires courts to search out a single hypothetical constitutionally doubtful case to limit a statute's terms in the wholly different case actually before the court, lest the court fail to adopt a reading of the statute that reflects the lowest common denominator. <i>Id.,</i> at 400 (dissenting opinion). This requires a reverse-<i>Salerno</i> analysis that upends our facial challenge requirements. See <i>Clark, supra,</i> at 381-382; see also <i>United States v. Salerno,</i> 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987) (for a facial challenge to succeed, there must be no circumstance in which <span class=\"star-pagination\">*149</span> the statute is constitutional). For this and other reasons I have explained, the <i>Clark</i> analysis allows much havoc to be wrought from the canon of constitutional avoidance. See <i>Clark, supra,</i> at 395-401 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p>In sum, I believe that Title III of the ADA, insofar as it requires structural changes, lacks a sufficiently clear statement that it applies to the internal affairs of foreign vessels. In my view the clear statement rule does not render Title III entirely inapplicable to foreign vessels; instead, Title III applies to foreign ships only to the extent to which it does not bear on their internal affairs. I therefore would remand for consideration of those Title III claims that do not pertain to the structure of the ship. Accordingly, I concur in Part III-A of the plurality opinion, join Part I-A of JUSTICE SCALIA's dissent, and concur in the judgment in part.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE O'CONNOR join, and with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins as to Part I-A, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent. The plurality correctly recognizes that Congress must clearly express its intent to apply its laws to foreign-flag ships when those laws interfere with the ship's internal order. Its attempt to place Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) outside this rule through creative statutory interpretation and piecemeal application of its provisions is unsupported by our case law. Title III plainly affects the internal order of foreign-flag cruise ships, subjecting them to the possibility of conflicting international obligations. I would hold that, since there is no clear statement of coverage, Title III does not apply to foreign-flag cruise ships.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>As the plurality explains, where a law would interfere with the regulation of a ship's internal order, we require a clear statement that Congress intended such a result. See <span class=\"star-pagination\">*150</span> <i>ante,</i> at 129. This rule is predicated on the \"rule of international law that the law of the flag state ordinarily governs the internal affairs of a ship,\" <i>McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros de Honduras,</i> 372 U. S. 10, 21 (1963), and is designed to avoid \"the possibilit[y] of international discord,\" <i>Benz v. Compania Naviera Hidalgo, S. A.,</i> 353 U. S. 138, 147 (1957); see also <i>McCulloch, supra,</i> at 19.</p>\n<p>The clear-statement rule finds support not only in <i>Benz</i> and <i>McCulloch,</i> but in cases like <i>Cunard S. S. Co. v. Mellon,</i> 262 U. S. 100, 128-129 (1923), where we held that the National Prohibition Act, 41 Stat. 305, forbade foreign-flag ships from carrying or serving alcohol in United States territorial waters. Though we did not say so expressly in that case, prohibiting the carrying and serving of alcohol in United States waters cannot be said to affect the \"internal order\" of the ship, because it does not in any way affect the operation or functioning of the craft.<sup>[1]</sup> Similarly, in <i>Lauritzen v. Larsen,</i> 345 U. S. 571 (1953), and <i>Hellenic Lines Ltd. v. Rhoditis,</i> 398 U. S. 306 (1970), we did <i>not</i> employ a clear-statement rule in determining whether foreign seamen injured aboard foreign-flag ships could recover under the Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U. S. C. App. \u00a7 688. We distinguished these cases in <i>McCulloch,</i> explaining that a clear statement is not required \"in different contexts, such as the Jones Act . . . where <i>the pervasive regulation of the internal order of a ship may not be present.\"</i> 372 U. S., at 19, n. 9 (emphasis added).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*151</span> As the plurality concedes, <i>ante,</i> at 134, the structura modifications that Title III of the ADA requires under its barrier-removal provisions, see 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 12182(b)(2) (A)(iv), 12184(b)(2)(C), would plainly affect the ship's \"internal order.\" Rendering exterior cabins handicapped accessible, changing the levels of coamings, and adding public restrooms \u0097 the types of modifications petitioners request \u0097 would require alteration of core physical aspects of the ship, some of which relate to safety. (Safety has, under international law, traditionally been the province of a ship's flag state.) This is quite different from prohibiting alcohol in United States waters or imposing tort liability for injuries sustained on foreign ships in port \u0097 the laws at issue in <i>Cunard</i> and the Jones Act cases. Those restrictions affected the ship only in limited circumstances, and in ways ancillary to its operation at sea. A ship's design and construction, by contrast, are at least as integral to the ship's operation and functioning as the bargaining relationship between shipowner and crew at issue in <i>Benz</i> and <i>McCulloch.</i></p>\n<p>Moreover, the structural changes petitioners request would be permanent. Whereas a ship precluded from serving or carrying alcohol in United States waters may certainly carry and serve alcohol on its next trip from Italy to Greece, structural modifications made to comply with American laws cannot readily be removed once the ship leaves our waters and ceases to carry American passengers. This is again much like the situation presented in <i>Benz</i> and <i>McCulloch,</i> where the application of American labor laws would have continued to govern contracts between foreign shipowners and their foreign crews well beyond their time in our waters.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the \"internal order\" clear-statement requirement is to avoid casually subjecting oceangoing vessels to laws that pose obvious risks of conflict with the laws of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*152</span> ship's flag state, the laws of other nations, and international obligations to which the vessels are subject. That structural modifications required under Title III qualify as matters of \"internal order\" is confirmed by the fact that they may already conflict with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), Nov. 1, 1974, [1979-1980] 32 U. S. T. 47, T. I. A. S. No. 9700. That treaty, which establishes the safety standards governing the design and maintenance of oceangoing ships, has been ratified by 155 countries. See International Maritime Organization, Summary of Status of Conventions, http://www.imo.org/Conventions/mainframe.asp?topic_id=247 (all Internet materials as visited June 2, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). The ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) Review Advisory Committee \u0097 the Government body Congress has charged with formulating the Title III barrier-removal guidelines \u0097 has promulgated rules requiring at least one accessible means of egress to be an elevator, whereas SOLAS, which requires at least two means of escape, does not allow elevators to be one of them. See Passenger Vessel Access Advisory Committee, Final Report: Recommendations for Accessibility Guidelines for Passenger Vehicles, ch. 13, pt. I (Dec. 2000), http://www.access-board.gov/news/pvaac-rept.htm (hereinafter PVAAC Report) (explaining potential conflicts between ADAAG regulations and SOLAS). The ADAAG rules set coaming heights for doors required to be accessible at one-half inch; SOLAS sets coaming heights for some exterior doors at three to six inches to ensure that those doors will be watertight. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Similar inconsistencies may exist between Title III's structural requirements and the disability laws of other countries. The United Kingdom, for example, is considering the promulgation of rules to govern handicapped accessibility to passenger vehicles, including cruise ships. The rules being considered currently include exact specifications, down to the centimeter, for the height of handrails, beds, and electrical <span class=\"star-pagination\">*153</span> switches, and the width of door openings. See Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, The design of large passenger ships and passenger infrastructure: Guidance on meeting the needs of disabled people (Nov. 2000), http://www.dptac.gov.uk/pubs/guideship/pdf/dptacbroch.pdf. Though many of these regulations may be compatible with Title III, it is easy to imagine conflicts arising, given the detailed nature of ADAAG's regulations. See PVAAC Report, chs. 1-11. As we have previously noted, even this \"<i>possibility</i> of international discord\" with regard to a seagoing vessel's internal order, <i>McCulloch,</i> 372 U. S., at 21 (emphasis added), gives rise to the presumption of noncoverage absent clear statement to the contrary.</p>\n<p>The Court asserts that Title III would not produce conflicts with the requirements of SOLAS and would not compromise safety concerns. This argument comes at the expense of an expansive <i>en passant</i> interpretation of the exceptions to the barrier-removal requirements of Title III \u0097 which interpretation will likely have more significant nationwide effects than the Court's holding concerning Title III's application to foreign-flag vessels. Assuming, however, that the argument is even correct,<sup>[3]</sup> it is entirely beside the point. It has never been a condition for application of the foreign-flag clear-statement rule that an actual conflict with foreign or international law be established \u0097 any more than that has been a condition for application of the clear-statement rule regarding extraterritorial effect of congressional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*154</span> enactments. The reason to apply the rule here is that the structure of a ship pertains to the ship's internal order, which is a matter presumably left to the flag state unless Congress indicates otherwise. The basis for that presumption of congressional intent is principally (though perhaps not exclusively) that subjecting such matters to the commands of various jurisdictions raises the <i>possibility</i> (not necessarily the certainty) of conflict among jurisdictions and with international treaties. Even if the Court could, by an imaginative interpretation of Title III, demonstrate that in this particular instance there would be no conflict with the laws of other nations or with international treaties,<sup>[4]</sup> it would remain true that a ship's structure is preeminently part of its internal order; and it would remain true that subjecting ship structure to multiple national requirements invites conflict. <i>That</i> is what triggers application of the clear-statement rule.</p>\n<p>Safety concerns \u0097 and specifically safety as related to ship structure \u0097 are traditionally the responsibility of the flag state. Which is to say they are regarded as part of the ship's internal order. And even if Title III makes ample provision for a safety exception to the barrier-removal requirements, what <i>it</i> considers necessary for safety is not necessarily what other nations or international treaties consider necessary.</p>\n<p>The foregoing renders quite unnecessary the Court's worry that Title III might require American cruise ships to adhere to Congress's prescription in violation of SOLAS. See <i>ante,</i> at 135-136. If and when that possibility presents itself, the Court remains free to do what it does here: to interpret Title III so as to avoid any conflict. But the availability <span class=\"star-pagination\">*155</span> of such an interpretation has no bearing upon whether the structural features of an oceangoing vessel are part of its internal order. (I must observe, however, that it seems much more plausible that Congress intended to require American cruise ships to adhere to Title III regardless of SOLAS, than that \u0097 what the Court apparently believes \u0097 Congress intended Title III to be interpreted with an eye to SOLAS.) In any event, the application of Title III to oceangoing vessels under American flag is not at issue here. I would therefore hold that, because Title III's barrier-removal provisions clearly have the possibility of subjecting foreign-flag ships to conflicting international obligations, no reading of Title III \u0097 no matter how creative \u0097 can alter the presumption that Title III does not apply to foreign-flag ships without a clear statement from Congress.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The plurality holds that, even \"[i]f Title III did impose a duty that required [foreign-flag] cruise ships to make permanent and significant structural modifications[,] or ... otherwise interfered with a foreign ship's internal affairs, ... Title III requirements having nothing to do with internal affairs would continue to apply to domestic and foreign ships alike.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 137-138. I disagree. Whether or not Title III's prescriptions regarding such matters implicate the \"internal order\" of the ship, they still relate to the ships' maritime operations and are part of the same Title III.<sup>[6]</sup> The requirements of that enactment either apply to foreign-flag ships or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*156</span> they do not. It is not within our power to design a statute some of whose provisions apply to foreign-flag ships and other of whose provisions do not \u0097 any more than it is within our power to prescribe that the statute applies to foreign-flag cruise ships 60% of whose passengers are United States citizens and does not apply to other foreign-flag cruise ships.</p>\n<p>The plurality's assertion that those portions of Title III that do <i>not</i> implicate a ship's internal order apply to foreign-flag ships displays a confusion between a principle of interpretation based upon a true-to-fact presumption of congressional intent, and a court-made rule. The plurality seems to forget that it is a matter of determining whether Congress <i>in fact intended</i> that its enactment cover foreign-flag ships. To believe that there was any such intent section-by-section and paragraph-by-paragraph is delusional. Either Congress enacted Title III only with domestic entities (and not foreign-flag ships) in mind, or it intended Title III to apply across-the-board. It could not possibly be the real congressional intent that foreign-flag cruise ships be considered \"place[s] of public accommodation\" or \"specified public transportation\" for purposes of certain provisions but not for others. That Congress had separate foreign-flag intent with respect to each requirement \u0097 and would presumably adopt a clear statement provision-by-provision \u0097 is utterly implausible. And far from its being the case that this creates \"a trap for an unwary Congress,\" <i>ante,</i> at 139, it is the plurality's disposition that, in piecemeal fashion, applies to foreign-flag ships provisions never enacted with foreign-flag vessels in mind.<sup>[7]</sup> We recently addressed a similar question <span class=\"star-pagination\">*157</span> in <i>Clark</i> v. <i>Martinez,</i> 543 U. S. 371 (2005), where we explained that a statutory provision must be interpreted consistently from case to case. \"It is not at all unusual to give a statut[e] . . . a limiting construction called for by one of the statute's applications, even though other of the statute's applications, standing alone, would not support the same limitation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 380. That principle should apply here. Since some applications of Title III plainly affect the internal order of foreign-flag ships, the absence of a clear statement renders the statute inapplicable \u0097 even though some applications of the statute, if severed from the rest, would not require clear statement.</p>\n<p>This does not mean that a clear statement is required whenever a court applies Title III to any entity \u0097 only that a clear statement is required to apply any part of Title III <i>to foreign-flag ships. </i><i>Raygor</i> v. <i>Regents of Univ. of Minn.,</i> 534 U. S. 533 (2002), and <i>Jinks</i> v. <i>Richland County,</i> 538 U. S. 456 (2003), do not dictate otherwise. <i>Raygor</i> held that 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1367(d) does not include, in its tolling of the limitations period, claims against States, because it contains no clear statement that States are covered. <i>Jinks</i> held that \u00a7 1367(d)'s tolling provision does apply to claims against political subdivisions of States, because no clear-statement requirement applies to those entities. In other words, a clear statement is required to apply \u00a7 1367(d) to States, just as a clear statement is required to apply Title III to foreign-flag ships. A clear statement is <i>not</i> required to apply \u00a7 1367(d) to political subdivisions of States, just as a clear statement is <i>not</i> required to apply Title III to domestic ships or other domestic entities. The question in each of these cases is whether <i>the statute</i> at issue covers certain entities, not whether some <i>provisions</i> of a statute cover a given entity.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*158</span> The fine tuning of legislation that the plurality requires would be better left to Congress. To attempt it through the process of case-by-case adjudication is a recipe for endless litigation and confusion. The plurality's resolution of today's case proves the point. It requires this Title III claimant (and every other one who brings a claim against a foreign shipowner) to show that each particular remedy he seeks does not implicate the internal order of the ship. That showing, where structural modification is involved, would not only require the district court to determine what is \"readily achievable,\" <i>ante,</i> at 135-136 (majority opinion), and what would \"pose `a significant risk to the health or safety of others,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 136 (majority opinion) (quoting \u00a7 12182(b)(3)), but would also require it to determine the obligations imposed by foreign law and international treaties.<sup>[8]</sup> All this to establish the preliminary point that Title III applies and the claim can proceed to adjudication. If Congress desires to impose this time-consuming and intricate process, it is certainly able to do so \u0097 though I think it would likely prefer some more manageable solution.<sup>[9]</sup> But for the plurality <span class=\"star-pagination\">*159</span> to impose it as a novel consequence of the venerable clear-statement rule seems to me unreasonable. I would therefore decline to apply all of Title III to foreign-flag ships without a clear statement from Congress.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>As the Court appears to concede, neither the \"public accommodation\" provision nor the \"specified public transportation\" provision of Title III clearly covers foreign-flag cruise ships. The former prohibits discrimination \"on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.\" 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 12182(a). Though Congress gave a seemingly exhaustive list of entities constituting \"public accommodation[s]\" \u0097 including inns, hotels, restaurants, theaters, banks, zoos, and laundromats \u0097 it failed to mention ships, much less foreign-flag ships. See \u00a7 12181(7). Particularly where Congress has provided such detailed specification, this is not a clear statement that foreign-flag ships are covered. Petitioners also claim that, because cruise ships are essentially floating hotels that contain restaurants and other facilities explicitly named in \u00a7 12181(7), they should be covered. While this may support the argument that <i>cruise ships</i> are \"public accommodations,\" it does not support the position that Congress intended to reach <i>foreign-flag</i> cruise ships.</p>\n<p>The \"specified public transportation\" provision prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability \"in the full and equal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*160</span> enjoyment of specified public transportation services provided by a private entity that is primarily engaged in the business of transporting people and whose operations affect commerce.\" \u00a7 12184(a). The definition of \"specified public transportation\" includes \"transportation by bus, rail, or any other conveyance (other than by aircraft) that provides the general public with general or special service (including charter service) on a regular and continuing basis.\" \u00a7 12181(10). \"[A]ny other conveyance\" clearly covers ships. But even if the statute specifically <i>mentioned</i> ships, that would not be a clear statement that <i>foreign-flag</i> ships are included \u0097 any more than the reference to \"employer\" in the NLRA constituted a clear statement that foreign-flag ship employers were covered, see <i>McCulloch,</i> 372 U. S., at 19-21.</p>\n<p>Title III of the ADA stands in contrast to other statutes in which Congress <i>has</i> made clear its intent to extend its laws to foreign ships. For example, the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, 94 Stat. 1159, 46 U. S. C. App. \u00a7 1901 <i>et seq.,</i> which permits the inspection and apprehension of vessels suspected of possessing controlled substances, applies to \"vessel[s] subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,\" \u00a7 1903(a), which includes vessels \"located within the customs waters of the United States,\" \u00a7 1903(c)(1)(D), and \"vessel[s] registered in a foreign nation where the flag nation has consented or waived objection\" to United States jurisdiction, \u00a7 1903(c)(1)(C). Section 5 of the Johnson Act, 64 Stat. 1135, as amended, 106 Stat. 61, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 1175(a), restricts the use of gambling devices \"on a vessel . . . documented under the laws of a foreign country.\" See also 14 U. S. C. \u00a7 89(a) (Coast Guard may engage in searches on \"waters over which the United States has jurisdiction\" of \"any vessel subject to the jurisdiction, or to the operation of any law, of the United States\"); 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 2274 (making it unlawful for \"the owner, master or person in charge or command of any private vessel, foreign or domestic . . . within the territorial waters of the United States\" willfully to cause or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*161</span> permit the destruction or injury of their vessel in certain circumstances).</p>\n<p>That the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation \u0097 the Executive agencies charged with enforcing the ADA \u0097 appear to have concluded that Congress intended Title III to apply to foreign-flag cruise ships does not change my view. We \"accept only those agency interpretations that are reasonable in light of the principles of construction courts normally employ.\" <i>ARAMCO,</i> 499 U. S. 244, 260 (1991) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (declining to adopt the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's determination that Title VII applied to employers abroad); see also <i>id.,</i> at 257-258 (opinion of the Court) (same). In light of our longstanding clear-statement rule, it is not reasonable to apply Title III here.</p>\n<p>I would therefore affirm the Fifth Circuit's judgment that Title III of the ADA does not apply to foreign-flag cruise ships in United States territorial waters.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   Briefs of <i>amid curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for the State of Texas et al. by <i>Greg Abbott,</i> Attorney General of Texas, <i>Barry R.

S., at 143, n. 5.</p>\n<p>[3]  One could hardly anticipate that, absent conflict with international legal obligations, the application of Title III sought in this case would generate a \"storm of diplomatic protest.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 146 (noting \"scorm of diplomatic protest\" against proposal to apply U. S. law to prohibit advance payments by a foreign vessel to foreign seamen in foreign ports).</p>\n<p>[4]  As the Court notes, the ships at issue here \"are operated by a company based in the United States, serve predominantly United States residents, and are in most other respects United States-centered ventures.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 126. Merchant ships sailing between U. S. and foreign ports would present a different question.</p>\n<p>[1]  The plurality also appears to have found that the National Prohibition Act contained a clear statement of intent to reach foreign-flag vessels, because the Act had been amended to state that it applied to \"all territory subject to [the] jurisdiction\" of the United States. <i>Cunard S. S. Co. v. Mellon,</i> 262 U. S. 100, 127 (1923) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>[2]  The plurality intimates that the clear-statement rule might be inapplicable in situations where, as here, the foreign-flag ships have a number of contacts with the United States. See <i>ante,</i> at 131-132. <i>McCulloch,</i> 372 U. S., at 19, expressly rejected this approach, explaining that any attempt to weigh the ship's contacts with the United States \"would inevitably lead to embarrassment in foreign affairs and [would] be entirely infeasible in actual practice.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  This is by no means clear. Title III defines \"readily achievable\" as \"easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense.\" 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 12181(9). It is, at best, ambiguous whether a barrier removal can be rendered not \"easily <i>accomplishable</i>\" or not \"able to be <i>carried out</i> without much difficulty\" by factors extrinsic to the removal itself. Conflict of an easily altered structure with foreign laws seems to me not much different from the tendency of an easily altered structure to deter customers. That is why, as suggested in text, the Court's unexpected Title III holding may be the most significant aspect of today's foreign-flag decision.</p>\n<p>[4]  The Court, of course, has not even shown that Title III is consistent with the laws of the cruise ships' flag state; much less has it undertaken the Herculean task \u0097 which its theory of presumed coverage by domestic law would require \u0097 of showing Title III consistent with the laws of all the cruise ships' ports of call.</p>\n<p>[5]  Of course this clear-statement rule would not apply to the onshore operations of foreign cruise companies, which would be treated no differently from the operations of other foreign companies on American soil.</p>\n<p>[6]  This includes the pricing and ticketing policies, which are intimately related to the ships' maritime operations (and perhaps to internal order) because they are designed to defray the added cost and provide the added protection that the cruise-ship companies deem necessary for safe transport of disabled passengers.</p>\n<p>[7]  The plurality's discussion of <i>Longshoremen</i> v. <i>Ariadne Shipping Co.,</i> 397 U. S. 195 (1970), is misleading. Although <i>Ariadne</i> clearly recognized the existence of an internal-order rule in our case law, see <i>id.,</i> at 200, <i>Ariadne</i> did not hold, similarly to what the plurality holds here, that application of the foreign-flag clear-statement rule prevented some provisions of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) from being applied to foreign-flag ships but allowed others to be applied. Rather, it held that the clear-statement rule <i>did not apply at all</i> to activities that were not \"within the `maritime operations of foreign-flag ships.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> The case is relevant only to questions the Court does not decide here \u0097 namely, application of Title III to onshore operations of the foreign-flag ships. It is <i>not</i> relevant to the question whether <i>all</i> maritime activities are exempt from Title III for lack of a clear statement.</p>\n<p>[8]  The plurality attempts to simplify this inquiry by explaining that, if it is \"a difficult question whether a particular Title III barrier-removal requirement is readily achievable, but the requirement does entail a permanent and significant structural modification, interfering with a foreign ship's internal affairs[,] a court sensibly could invoke the clear statement rule without determining whether Title III actually imposes the requirement.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 137. It is impossible to reconcile this with the plurality's rationale, which excludes the clear-statement rule when there is no actual conflict with foreign law. On the plurality's own analysis, significant structural modifications are <i>least likely</i> to pose an actual conflict with foreign law, since they are <i>most likely</i> to be regarded as (under the plurality's new Title III jurisprudence) not \"readily achievable\" and hence not required. I am at a loss to understand what the plurality has in mind.</p>\n<p>[9]  After this Court concluded, in <i>EEOC</i> v. <i>Arabian American Oil Co.,</i> 499 U. S. 244, 260 (1991) <i>(ARAMCO),</i> that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not protect American citizens working for American employers in foreign countries, Congress amended Title VII. Unlike what would have been this Court's only available resolution of the issue had it come to the opposite conclusion in <i>ARAMCO</i> \u0097 that Title VII applies to all American employers operating abroad \u0097 Congress was able to craft a more nuanced solution by exempting employers if compliance with Title VII would run afoul of the law in the country where the workplace was located. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-1(b); cf. \u00a7 12112(c)(1) (same disposition for Title I of the ADA).</p>\n\n</div>",

The petitioners, dis-\n  abled individuals and their companions who purchased tickets for\n  round-trip NCL cruises from Houston, sued NCL under Title III of\n  the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U. S. C.\n  \u00a712181 et seq., which prohibits discrimination based on disability in\n  places of \u201cpublic accommodation,\u201d \u00a712182(a), and in \u201cspecified public\n  transportation services,\u201d \u00a712184(a), and requires covered entities to\n  make \u201creasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures\u201d\n  to     accommodate        disabled      persons,     \u00a7\u00a712182(b)(2)(A)(ii),\n  12184(b)(2)(A), and to remove \u201carchitectural barriers, and communi-\n  cation barriers that are structural in nature\u201d where such removal is\n  \u201creadily achievable,\u201d \u00a7\u00a712182(b)(2)(A)(iv), 12184(b)(2)(C). Though\n  holding Title III generally applicable, the District Court found that\n  the petitioners\u2019 claims regarding physical barriers to access could not\n  go forward because the federal agencies charged with promulgating\n  ADA architectural and structural guidelines had not done so for\n  cruise ships. The court therefore dismissed the barrier-removal\n  claims, but denied NCL\u2019s motion to dismiss the petitioners\u2019 other\n  claims. The Fifth Circuit held that Title III does not apply to foreign-\n  flag cruise ships in U. S. waters because of a presumption, which the\n  court derived from, e.g., Benz v. Compania Naviera Hidalgo, S. A., 353\n  U. S. 138, and McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros de Hondu-\n  ras, 372 U. S. 10, that absent a clear indication of congressional in-\n  tent, general statutes do not apply to foreign-flag ships. Emphasiz-\n  ing that Title III does not contain a specific provision mandating its\n  application to such vessels, the court sustained the dismissal of the peti-\n  tioners\u2019 barrier-removal claims and reversed on their remaining claims.\n2          SPECTOR v. NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n356 F. 3d 641, reversed and remanded.\n     JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered an opinion concluding that except inso-\n  far as Title III regulates a vessel\u2019s internal affairs, the statute is ap-\n  plicable to foreign-flag cruise ships in U. S. waters. Parts II\u2013A\u20131 and\n  II\u2013B\u20132 of that opinion held for the Court:\n     (a) Although Title III\u2019s \u201cpublic accommodation\u201d and \u201cspecified pub-\n  lic transportation\u201d definitions, \u00a7\u00a712181(7)(A),(B)(I),(L), 12181(10), do\n  not expressly mention cruise ships, there is no doubt that the NCL\n  ships in question fall within both definitions under conventional\n  principles of interpretation. The Fifth Circuit nevertheless held Title\n  III inapplicable because the statute has no clear statement or explicit\n  text mandating coverage for foreign-flag ships in U. S waters. This\n  Court\u2019s cases, particularly Benz and McCulloch, do hold, in some cir-\n  cumstances, that a general statute will not apply to certain aspects of\n  the internal operations of foreign vessels temporarily in U. S. waters,\n  absent a clear statement. The broad clear statement rule adopted by\n  the Court of Appeals, however, would apply to every facet of the busi-\n  ness and operations of foreign-flag ships. That formulation is inconsis-\n  tent with the Court\u2019s case law and with sound principles of statutory in-\n  terpretation. Pp. 5\u20136.\n     (b) Title III defines \u201creadily achievable\u201d barrier removal as that\n  which is \u201ceasily accomplishable and able to be carried out without\n  much difficulty or expense,\u201d \u00a712181(9). The statute does not further\n  define \u201cdifficulty,\u201d but the section\u2019s use of the disjunctive indicates\n  that it extends to considerations in addition to cost. Furthermore, Ti-\n  tle III directs that the \u201creadily achievable\u201d determination take into\n  account \u201cthe impact . . . upon the [facility\u2019s] operation,\u201d \u00a712181(9)(B).\n  A Title III barrier-removal requirement that would bring a vessel\n  into noncompliance with the International Convention for the Safety\n  of Life at Sea or any other international legal obligation would create\n  serious difficulties for the vessel and would have a substantial impact\n  on its operation, and thus would not be \u201creadily achievable.\u201d Con-\n  gress could not have intended this result. It is logical and proper to\n  conclude, moreover, that whether a barrier modification is \u201creadily\n  achievable\u201d must take into consideration the modification\u2019s effect on\n  shipboard safety. Title III\u2019s nondiscrimination and accommodation\n  requirements do not apply if disabled individuals would pose \u201ca sig-\n  nificant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be elimi-\n  nated by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures.\u201d\n  \u00a712182(b)(3). It would be incongruous to attribute to Congress an in-\n  tent to require modifications threatening others\u2019 safety simply be-\n  cause the threat comes not from the disabled person but from the ac-\n  commodation itself.

See, e.g., Wildenhus\u2019s Case, 120 U. S. 1,\n12. In Benz and McCulloch, the Court held the National Labor Rela-\ntions Act (NLRA) inapplicable to labor relations between a foreign\nvessel and its foreign crew not because foreign ships are generally\nexempt from the NLRA, but because that particular application of\nthe NLRA would interfere with matters that concern only the ship\u2019s\ninternal operations. These cases recognized a narrow rule, applicable\nonly to statutory duties that implicate the foreign vessel\u2019s internal\norder rather than the welfare of American citizens. E.g., McCulloch,\nsupra, at 21. In contrast, the Court later held the NLRA fully appli-\ncable to labor relations between a foreign vessel and American long-\nshoremen because this relationship, unlike the one between a vessel\nand its own crew, does not implicate a foreign ship\u2019s internal order\nand discipline. Longshoremen v. Ariadne Shipping Co., 397 U. S.\n195, 198\u2013201. This narrow clear statement rule is supported by\nsound principles of statutory construction. It is reasonable to pre-\nsume Congress intends no interference with matters that are primar-\nily of concern only to the ship and the foreign state in which it is reg-\nistered. It is also reasonable, however, to presume Congress does\nintend its statutes to apply to entities in U. S. territory that serve,\nemploy, or otherwise affect American citizens, or that affect the peace\nand tranquility of the United States, even if those entities happen to\nbe foreign-flag ships. Cruise ships flying foreign flags of convenience\nbut departing from and returning to U. S. ports accommodate and\ntransport over 7 million U. S. residents annually, including large\nnumbers of disabled individuals. To hold there is no Title III protec-\ntion for the disabled would be a harsh and unexpected interpretation\nof a statute designed to provide broad protection for them. Pp. 6\u20139.\n   (b) Plainly, most of the Title III violations alleged below\u2014that NCL\nrequired disabled passengers to pay higher fares and special sur-\ncharges; maintained evacuation programs and equipment in locations\nnot accessible to them; required them, but not other passengers, to\nwaive any potential medical liability and to travel with companions;\nreserved the right to remove them from ships if they endangered\nother passengers\u2019 comfort; and, more generally, failed to make rea-\nsonable modifications necessary to ensure their full enjoyment of the\nservices offered\u2014have nothing to do with a ship\u2019s internal affairs.\nHowever, the petitioners\u2019 allegations concerning physical barriers to\naccess on board\u2014e.g., their assertion that most of NCL\u2019s cabins, in-\n4            SPECTOR v. NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    cluding the most attractive ones in the most desirable locations, are\n    not accessible to disabled passengers\u2014would appear to involve re-\n    quirements that might be construed as relating to internal ship af-\n    fairs. The clear statement rule would most likely come into play if\n    Title III were read to require permanent and significant structural\n    modifications to foreign vessels. Pp. 9\u201312.\n       (c) Because Title III does not require structural modifications that\n    conflict with international legal obligations or pose any real threat to\n    the safety of the crew or other passengers, it may well follow that Ti-\n    tle III does not require any permanent and significant structural\n    modifications that interfere with cruise ships\u2019 internal affairs. If so,\n    recourse to the internal affairs clear statement rule would not be\n    necessary. Cases may arise, however, where it is prudent for a court\n    to invoke that rule without determining whether Title III actually\n    imposes a particular barrier-removal requirement entailing a perma-\n    nent and significant structural modification interfering with a foreign\n    ship\u2019s internal affairs. Conversely, where it is not obvious that a par-\n    ticular physical modification relates to a vessel\u2019s basic architecture\n    and construction, but it is clear the modification would conflict with\n    an international legal obligation, the court may simply hold the modi-\n    fication not readily achievable, without resort to the clear statement\n    rule. Pp. 13\u201314.\n       (d) The holding that the clear statement rule operates only when a\n    ship\u2019s internal affairs are affected does not implicate the Court\u2019s\n    holding in Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. ___, ___, that statutory lan-\n    guage given a limiting construction in one context must be inter-\n    preted consistently in other contexts, \u201ceven though other of the stat-\n    ute\u2019s applications, standing alone, would not support the same\n    limitation.\u201d Martinez applied a canon for choosing among plausible\n    meanings of an ambiguous statute, not a clear statement rule that\n    implies a special substantive limit on the application of an otherwise\n    unambiguous statutory mandate. Pp. 16\u201318.\n       JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE SOUTER, and\n    JUSTICE THOMAS, concluded in Part III\u2013A that if Title III imposed a\n    requirement that interfered with a foreign-flag cruise ship\u2019s internal\n    affairs, the clear statement rule would come into play, but that re-\n    quirement would still apply to domestic ships, and Title III require-\n    ments having nothing to do with internal affairs would continue to\n    apply to domestic and foreign ships alike. This application-by-\n    application approach is consistent with how the clear statement rule\n    has traditionally operated. If the rule restricts some NLRA applica-\n    tions to foreign ships (e.g., labor relations with foreign crews in Benz\n    and McCulloch), but not others (e.g., labor relations with American\n    longshoremen in Ariadne Shipping), it follows that its case-by-case\n                      Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                      5\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  application is also required under Title III. The clear statement rule,\n  if it is invoked, would restrict some applications of Title III to foreign\n  ships (e.g., certain structural barrier modification requirements), but\n  not others (e.g., the statute\u2019s prohibition on discriminatory ticket\n  pricing). The rule is an implied limitation on a statute\u2019s otherwise\n  unambiguous general terms. It operates much like other implied\n  limitation rules, which avoid applications of otherwise unambiguous\n  statutes that would intrude on sensitive domains in a way that Con-\n  gress is unlikely to have intended had it considered the matter. See,\n  e.g., EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 260. An all-\n  or-nothing approach would convert the clear statement rule from a\n  principle of interpretive caution into a trap for an unwary Congress,\n  requiring nullification of the entire statute, or of some arbitrary set of\n  applications larger than the domain the rule protects. Pp. 14\u201316.\n     JUSTICE GINSBURG, joined by JUSTICE BREYER, agreed that Title III\n  of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 covers cruise ships and\n  allows them to resist modifications that would conflict with interna-\n  tional legal obligations, but would give no wider berth to the \u201cinternal\n  affairs\u201d clear statement rule in determining Title III\u2019s application to\n  respondent\u2019s ships. That rule derives from, and is moored to, the\n  broader guide that statutes \u201cshould not be interpreted to regulate\n  foreign persons or conduct if that regulation would conflict with prin-\n  ciples of international law.\u201d Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509\n  U. S. 764, 815. This noninterference principle is served here by the\n  Court\u2019s interpretation of 42 U. S. C. \u00a712182(b)(2)(A)(iv)\u2019s \u201creadily\n  achievable\u201d language to avoid conflict with international legal obliga-\n  tions. The plurality\u2019s further suggestion that the \u201cinternal affairs\u201d\n  clear statement rule may block Title III-prompted structural modifi-\n  cations, even in the absence of conflict with international obligations,\n  cuts the rule loose from its foundation. Because international rela-\n  tions are not at risk and the United States has a strong interest in\n  protecting American passengers on foreign and domestic cruise ships,\n  there is no reason to demand a clearer congressional statement that\n  Title III reaches the vessels in question. Pp. 1\u20134.\n     JUSTICE THOMAS concluded that Title III of the of the Americans\n  with Disabilities Act of 1990, insofar as it could be read to require\n  structural changes, lacks a sufficiently clear statement that it applies\n  to the internal affairs of foreign vessels. However, the clear state-\n  ment rule does not render Title III entirely inapplicable to foreign\n  vessels; instead, Title III applies to foreign ships only to the extent to\n  which it does not bear on their internal affairs.

S. C. \u00a712181 et seq., applies to foreign-flag\ncruise ships in United States waters. The Court of Ap-\npeals for the Fifth Circuit held Title III did not apply\nbecause of a presumption, which it sought to derive from\nthis Court\u2019s case law, that, absent a clear indication of\ncongressional intent, general statutes do not apply to\nforeign-flag ships. 356 F. 3d 641, 644\u2013646 (2004). The\nCourt of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, on the other\nhand, has held that the ADA does apply to foreign-flag\ncruise ships in United States waters. See Stevens v. Pre-\nmier Cruises, Inc., 215 F. 3d 1237 (2000). We granted\ncertiorari to resolve the conflict. 542 U. S. ___ (2004).\n2        SPECTOR v. NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Our cases hold that a clear statement of congressional\nintent is necessary before a general statutory requirement\ncan interfere with matters that concern a foreign-flag\nvessel\u2019s internal affairs and operations, as contrasted with\nstatutory requirements that concern the security and well-\nbeing of United States citizens or territory. While the\nclear statement rule could limit Title III\u2019s application to\nforeign-flag cruise ships in some instances, when it re-\nquires removal of physical barriers, it would appear the\nrule is inapplicable to many other duties Title III might\nimpose. We therefore reverse the decision of the Court of\nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit that the ADA is altogether\ninapplicable to foreign vessels; and we remand for further\nproceedings.\n                              I\n  The respondent Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd. (NCL), a\nBermuda Corporation with a principal place of business in\nMiami, Florida, operates cruise ships that depart from,\nand return to, ports in the United States. The ships are\nessentially floating resorts. They provide passengers with\nstaterooms or cabins, food, and entertainment. The cruise\nships stop at different ports of call where passengers may\ndisembark. Most of the passengers on these cruises are\nUnited States residents; under the terms and conditions of\nthe tickets, disputes between passengers and NCL are to\nbe governed by United States law; and NCL relies upon\nextensive advertising in the United States to promote its\ncruises and increase its revenues.\n  Despite the fact that the cruises are operated by a com-\npany based in the United States, serve predominately\nUnited States residents, and are in most other respects\nUnited States-centered ventures, almost all of NCL\u2019s\ncruise ships are registered in other countries, flying so-\ncalled flags of convenience. The two NCL cruise ships that\nare the subject of the present litigation, the Norwegian\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSea and the Norwegian Star, are both registered in the\nBahamas.\n   The petitioners are disabled individuals and their com-\npanions who purchased tickets in 1998 or 1999 for round-\ntrip cruises on the Norwegian Sea or the Norwegian Star,\nwith departures from Houston, Texas. Naming NCL as\nthe defendant, the petitioners filed a class action in the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of\nTexas on behalf of all persons similarly situated. They\nsought declaratory and injunctive relief under Title III of\nthe ADA, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of\ndisability. The petitioners asserted that cruise ships are\ncovered both by Title III\u2019s prohibition on discrimination in\nplaces of \u201cpublic accommodation,\u201d \u00a712182(a), and by its\nprohibition on discrimination in \u201cspecified public transpor-\ntation services,\u201d \u00a712184(a).       Both provisions require\ncovered entities to make \u201creasonable modifications in\npolicies, practices, or procedures\u201d to accommodate disabled\nindividuals, \u00a7\u00a712182(b)(2)(A)(ii), 12184(b)(2)(A), and re-\nquire removal of \u201carchitectural barriers, and communi-\ncation barriers that are structural in nature\u201d where\nsuch removal is \u201creadily achievable,\u201d \u00a7\u00a712182(b)(2)(A)(iv),\n12184(b)(2)(C).\n   The District Court held that, as a general matter, Title\nIII applies to foreign-flag cruise ships in United States\nterritorial waters. Civ. Action No. H\u201300\u20132649 (SD Tex.,\nSept. 10, 2002), App. to Pet. for Cert. 35a. The District\nCourt found, however, that the petitioners\u2019 claims regard-\ning physical barriers to access could not go forward be-\ncause the agencies charged with promulgating architec-\ntural and structural guidelines for ADA compliance (the\nArchitectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance\nBoard, the Department of Transportation, and the De-\npartment of Justice) had not done so for cruise ships. In\nthese circumstances, the court held, it is unclear what\nstructural modifications NCL would need to make. Id., at\n4        SPECTOR v. NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n36a\u201342a. The District Court granted NCL\u2019s motion to\ndismiss the barrier-removal claims, but denied NCL\u2019s\nmotion with respect to all the other claims. Id., at 47a.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in\npart and reversed in part. It reasoned that our cases,\nparticularly Benz v. Compania Naviera Hidalgo, S. A., 353\nU. S. 138 (1957), and McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de\nMarineros de Honduras, 372 U. S. 10 (1963), stand for the\nproposition that general statutes do not apply to foreign-flag\nvessels in United States territory absent a clear indication\nof congressional intent. 356 F. 3d, at 644 (\u201c[T]o apply do-\nmestic law to foreign vessels entering United States waters,\nthere must be present the affirmative intention of the Con-\ngress clearly expressed\u201d (quoting Benz, supra, at 147 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted)); 356 F. 3d, at 646 (Benz and\nMcCulloch \u201cprohibit United States courts from applying\ndomestic statutes to foreign-flagged ships without specific\nevidence of congressional intent\u201d). As Title III does not\ncontain a specific provision mandating its application to\nforeign-flag vessels, the Court of Appeals sustained the\nDistrict Court\u2019s dismissal of the petitioners\u2019 barrier-removal\nclaims on this alternative ground and reversed the District\nCourt on the remaining Title III claims. 356 F. 3d, at 650\u2013\n651.\n   The action was ordered dismissed for failure to state a\nclaim, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6), before extensive discov-\nery. We cannot then discuss the specific allegations in much\ndetail but must confine our opinion to the relevant general\nprinciples. (On November 24, 2004, the responsible agen-\ncies finally did issue draft guidelines for large passenger\nvessels and a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. See 69 Fed.\nReg. 69244, 69249.

S. C. \u00a712182(a), and public\ntransportation services, \u00a712184(a). The general prohi-\nbitions are supplemented by various, more specific\nrequirements. Entities that provide public accommo-\ndations or public transportation: (1) may not impose\n\u201celigibility criteria\u201d that tend to screen out disabled\nindividuals, \u00a7\u00a712182(b)(2)(A)(i), 12184(b)(1); (2) must\nmake \u201creasonable modifications in policies, practices, or\nprocedures, when such modifications are necessary\u201d to\nprovide disabled individuals full and equal enjoy-\nment, \u00a7\u00a712182(b)(2)(A)(ii), 12184(b)(2)(A); (3) must pro-\nvide auxiliary aids and services to disabled individ-\nuals, \u00a7\u00a712182(b)(2)(A)(iii), 12184(b)(2)(B); and (4) must\nremove architectural and structural barriers, or if barrier\nremoval is not readily achievable, must ensure equal\naccess for the disabled through alternative methods,\n\u00a7\u00a712182(b)(2)(A)(iv)\u2013(v), 12184(b)(2)(C).\n   These specific requirements, in turn, are subject to\nimportant exceptions and limitations. Eligibility criteria\nthat screen out disabled individuals are permitted when\n\u201cnecessary for the provision\u201d of the services or facilities\nbeing offered, \u00a7\u00a712182(b)(2)(A)(i), 12184(b)(1). Policies,\npractices, and procedures need not be modified, and auxil-\niary aids need not be provided, if doing so would \u201cfunda-\nmentally alter\u201d the services or accommodations being\noffered. \u00a7\u00a712182(b)(2)(A)(ii)\u2013(iii). Auxiliary aids are also\nunnecessary when they would \u201cresult in an undue bur-\nden,\u201d \u00a712182(b)(2)(A)(iii). As we have noted, moreover, the\nbarrier removal and alternative access requirements do\nnot apply when these requirements are not \u201creadily\n6        SPECTOR v. NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD.\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nachievable,\u201d \u00a7\u00a712182(b)(2)(A)(iv)\u2013(v). Additionally, Title\nIII does not impose nondiscrimination or accommodation\nrequirements if, as a result, disabled individuals would\npose \u201ca significant risk to the health or safety of others\nthat cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies,\npractices, or procedures or by the provision of auxiliary\naids or services,\u201d \u00a712182(b)(3).\n  Although the statutory definitions of \u201cpublic accommo-\ndation\u201d and \u201cspecified public transportation\u201d do not ex-\npressly mention cruise ships, there can be no serious\ndoubt that the NCL cruise ships in question fall within\nboth definitions under conventional principles of interpre-\ntation. \u00a7\u00a712181(7)(A)\u2013(B),(I),(L), 12181(10). The Court of\nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit, nevertheless, held that Title\nIII does not apply to foreign-flag cruise ships in United\nStates waters because the statute has no clear statement\nor explicit text mandating coverage for these ships. This\nCourt\u2019s cases, particularly Benz and McCulloch, do hold,\nin some circumstances, that a general statute will not\napply to certain aspects of the internal operations of for-\neign vessels temporarily in United States waters, absent a\nclear statement. The broad clear statement rule adopted by\nthe Court of Appeals, however, would apply to every facet of\nthe business and operations of foreign-flag ships. That\nformulation is inconsistent with the Court\u2019s case law and\nwith sound principles of statutory interpretation.\n                              2\n  This Court has long held that general statutes are pre-\nsumed to apply to conduct that takes place aboard a for-\neign-flag vessel in United States territory if the interests\nof the United States or its citizens, rather than interests\ninternal to the ship, are at stake. See Cunard S. S. Co. v.\nMellon, 262 U. S. 100, 127 (1923) (holding that the general\nterms of the National Prohibition Act apply to foreign-flag\nships in United States waters because \u201c[t]here is in the act\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           7\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nno provision making it inapplicable\u201d to such ships); Uravic\nv. F. Jarka Co., 282 U. S. 234, 240 (1931) (holding that\n\u201cgeneral words\u201d should be \u201cgenerally applied\u201d and that\ntherefore there is \u201cno reason for limiting the liability for\ntorts committed [aboard foreign-flag ships in United\nStates territory] when they go beyond the scope of disci-\npline and private matters that do not interest the territo-\nrial power\u201d). The general rule that United States statutes\napply to foreign-flag ships in United States territory is\nsubject only to a narrow exception. Absent a clear state-\nment of congressional intent, general statutes may not\napply to foreign-flag vessels insofar as they regulate mat-\nters that involve only the internal order and discipline of\nthe vessel, rather than the peace of the port. This qualifi-\ncation derives from the understanding that, as a matter of\ninternational comity, \u201call matters of discipline and all\nthings done on board which affec[t] only the vessel or\nthose belonging to her, and [do] not involve the peace or\ndignity of the country, or the tranquility of the port,\nshould be left by the local government to be dealt with by\nthe authorities of the nation to which the vessel belonged.\u201d\nWildenhus\u2019s Case, 120 U. S. 1, 12 (1887). This exception to\nthe usual presumption, however, does not extend beyond\nmatters of internal order and discipline. \u201c[I]f crimes are\ncommitted on board [a foreign-flag vessel] of a character to\ndisturb the peace and tranquility of the country to which\nthe vessel has been brought, the offenders have never by\ncomity or usage been entitled to any exemption from the\noperation of the local laws.\u201d Ibid.\n  The two cases in recent times in which the presumption\nagainst applying general statutes to foreign vessels\u2019 inter-\nnal affairs has been invoked, Benz and McCulloch, concern\nlabor relations. The Court held that the general terms of\nthe National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 49 Stat. 449, 29\nU. S. C. \u00a7151 et seq., did not govern the respective rights\nand duties of a foreign ship and its crew because the\n8        SPECTOR v. NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD.\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nNLRA standards would interfere with the foreign vessel\u2019s\ninternal affairs in those circumstances. These cases rec-\nognized a narrow rule, applicable only to statutory duties\nthat implicate the internal order of the foreign vessel\nrather than the welfare of American citizens. McCulloch,\n372 U.

The Court\nheld the NLRA inapplicable to labor relations between a\nforeign vessel and its foreign crew not because foreign\nships are generally exempt from the NLRA, but because\nthe particular application of the NLRA would interfere\nwith matters that concern only the internal operations of\nthe ship. In contrast, the Court held that the NLRA is\nfully applicable to labor relations between a foreign vessel\nand American longshoremen because this relationship,\nunlike the one between a vessel and its own crew, does not\nimplicate a foreign ship\u2019s internal order and discipline.\nLongshoremen v. Ariadne Shipping Co., 397 U. S. 195,\n198\u2013201 (1970).\n  This narrow clear statement rule is supported by sound\nprinciples of statutory construction. It is reasonable to\npresume Congress intends no interference with matters\nthat are primarily of concern only to the ship and the\nforeign state in which it is registered. It is also reason-\nable, however, to presume Congress does intend its stat-\nutes to apply to entities in United States territory that\nserve, employ, or otherwise affect American citizens, or\nthat affect the peace and tranquility of the United States,\neven if those entities happen to be foreign-flag ships.\n  Cruise ships flying foreign flags of convenience offer\npublic accommodations and transportation services to over\n7 million United States residents annually, departing from\nand returning to ports located in the United States.

The clear statement rule adopted\nby the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, moreover,\nwould imply that other general federal statutes\u2014\nincluding, for example, Title II of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964, 78 Stat. 243, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000a et seq.\u2014would not\napply aboard foreign cruise ships in United States waters.\nA clear statement rule with this sweeping application is\nunlikely to reflect congressional intent.\n   The relevant category for which the Court demands a\nclear congressional statement, then, consists not of all\napplications of a statute to foreign-flag vessels but only\nthose applications that would interfere with the foreign\nvessel\u2019s internal affairs. This proposition does not mean\nthe clear statement rule is irrelevant to the ADA, how-\never. If Title III by its terms does impose duties that\ninterfere with a foreign-flag cruise ship\u2019s internal affairs,\nthe lack of a clear congressional statement can mean that\nthose specific applications of Title III are precluded. On\nremand, the Court of Appeals may need to consider which,\nif any, Title III requirements interfere with the internal\naffairs of foreign-flag vessels. As we will discuss further,\nhowever, Title III\u2019s own limitations and qualifications may\nmake this inquiry unnecessary.\n                             B\n                              1\n  The precise content of the category \u201cinternal affairs\u201d (or,\nas it is variously denoted in the case law, \u201cinternal order\u201d\nor \u201cinternal operations\u201d) is difficult to define with preci-\nsion. There is, moreover, some ambiguity in our cases as\nto whether the relevant category of activities is restricted\n10       SPECTOR v.

We need not attempt to define the relevant protected\ncategory with precision. It suffices to observe that the\nguiding principles in determining whether the clear\nstatement rule is triggered are the desire for international\ncomity and the presumed lack of interest by the territorial\nsovereign in matters that bear no substantial relation to\nthe peace and tranquility of the port.\n   It is plain that Title III might impose any number of\nduties on cruise ships that have nothing to do with a ship\u2019s\ninternal affairs.

We can\nsay, however, that none of these alleged Title III violations\nimplicate any requirement that would interfere with the\ninternal affairs and management of a vessel as our cases\nhave employed that term.\n   At least one subset of the petitioners\u2019 allegations, how-\never, would appear to involve requirements that might be\nconstrued as relating to the internal affairs of foreign-flag\ncruise ships. These allegations concern physical barriers\nto access on board. For example, according to the petition-\ners, most of the cabins on the respondent\u2019s cruise ships,\nincluding the most attractive cabins in the most desirable\nlocations, are not accessible to disabled passengers. Brief\nfor Petitioners 17\u201318; Complaint \u00b616, App. 11. The peti-\ntioners also allege that the ships\u2019 coamings\u2014the raised\nedges around their doors\u2014make many areas of the ships\ninaccessible to mobility-impaired passengers who use\nwheelchairs or scooters. Brief for Petitioners 24. Removal\nof these and other access barriers, the petitioners suggest,\nmay be required by Title III\u2019s structural barrier removal\nrequirement, \u00a7\u00a712182(b)(2)(A)(iv), 12184(b)(2)(C).\n   Although these physical barriers affect the passengers\nas well as the ship and its crew, the statutory requirement\ncould mandate a permanent and significant alteration of a\nphysical feature of the ship\u2014that is, an element of basic\nship design and construction. If so, these applications of\nthe barrier removal requirement likely would interfere\nwith the internal affairs of foreign ships. A permanent\nand significant modification to a ship\u2019s physical structure\ngoes to fundamental issues of ship design and construc-\ntion, and it might be impossible for a ship to comply with\nall the requirements different jurisdictions might impose.\nThe clear statement rule would most likely come into play\nif Title III were read to require permanent and significant\nstructural modifications to foreign vessels. It is quite a\ndifferent question, however, whether Title III would re-\n12       SPECTOR v. NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nquire this. The Title III requirements that might impose\npermanent and substantial changes to a ship\u2019s architec-\nture and design, are, like all of Title III\u2019s requirements,\nsubject to the statute\u2019s own specific limitations and quali-\nfications. These limitations may make resort to the clear\nstatement rule unnecessary.\n                               2\n   Title III requires barrier removal if it is \u201creadily achiev-\nable,\u201d \u00a712182(b)(2)(A)(iv). The statute defines that term\nas \u201ceasily accomplishable and able to be carried out with-\nout much difficulty or expense,\u201d \u00a712181(9). Title III does\nnot define \u201cdifficulty\u201d in \u00a712181(9), but use of the disjunc-\ntive\u2014\u201ceasily accomplishable and able to be carried out\nwithout much difficulty or expense\u201d\u2014indicates that it\nextends to considerations in addition to cost. Further-\nmore, Title III directs that the \u201creadily achievable\u201d deter-\nmination take into account \u201cthe impact . . . upon the op-\neration of the facility,\u201d \u00a712181(9)(B).\n   Surely a barrier removal requirement under Title III\nthat would bring a vessel into noncompliance with the\nInternational Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea\n(SOLAS), Nov. 1, 1974, [1979\u20131980], 32 U. S. T. 47, T. I. A.\nS. No. 9700, or any other international legal obligation,\nwould create serious difficulties for the vessel and would\nhave a substantial impact on its operation, and thus would\nnot be \u201creadily achievable.\u201d This understanding of the\nstatute, urged by the United States, is eminently reason-\nable.

Congress could not have intended this result.\n   It is logical and proper to conclude, moreover, that\nwhether a barrier modification is \u201creadily achievable\u201d\nunder Title III must take into consideration the modifica-\ntion\u2019s effect on shipboard safety. A separate provision of\nTitle III mandates that the statute\u2019s nondiscrimination\nand accommodation requirements do not apply if disabled\nindividuals would pose \u201ca significant risk to the health or\nsafety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modifica-\ntion of policies, practices, or procedures or by the provision\nof auxiliary aids or services,\u201d \u00a712182(b)(3). This reference\nis to a safety threat posed by a disabled individual,\nwhereas here the question would be whether the struc-\ntural modification itself may pose the safety threat. It\nwould be incongruous, nevertheless, to attribute to Con-\ngress an intent to require modifications that threaten\nsafety to others simply because the threat comes not from\nthe disabled person but from the accommodation itself.\nThe anomaly is avoided by concluding that a structural\nmodification is not readily achievable within the meaning\nof \u00a712181(9) if it would pose a direct threat to the health\nor safety of others.\n                             3\n   Because Title III does not require structural modifica-\ntions that would conflict with international legal obliga-\ntions or pose any real threat to the safety of the crew or\nother passengers, it may well follow\u2014though we do not\ndecide the question here\u2014that Title III does not require\nany permanent and significant structural modifications\nthat interfere with the internal affairs of any cruise ship,\nforeign flag or domestic. If that is indeed the case, re-\ncourse to the clear statement rule would not be necessary.\n14       SPECTOR v. NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n   Cases may arise, however, where it is prudent for a\ncourt to turn first to the internal affairs clear statement\nrule rather than deciding the precise scope and operation\nof the statute. Suppose, for example, it is a difficult ques-\ntion whether a particular Title III barrier removal re-\nquirement is readily achievable, but the requirement does\nentail a permanent and significant structural modifica-\ntion, interfering with a foreign ship\u2019s internal affairs. In\nthat case a court sensibly could invoke the clear statement\nrule without determining whether Title III actually im-\nposes the requirement. On the other hand, there may be\nmany cases where it is not obvious that a particular physi-\ncal modification relates to a vessel\u2019s basic architecture and\nconstruction, but it is clear the modification would conflict\nwith SOLAS or some other international legal obligation.\nIn those cases, a court may deem it appropriate to hold\nthat the physical barrier modification in question is not\nreadily achievable, without resort to the clear statement\nrule.\n                              III\n                               A\n  In light of the preceding analysis, it is likely that under\na proper interpretation of \u201creadily achievable\u201d Title III\nwould impose no requirements that interfere with the\ninternal affairs of foreign-flag cruise ships. If Title III did\nimpose a duty that required cruise ships to make perma-\nnent and significant structural modifications that did not\nconflict with international law or threaten safety, or if the\nstatute otherwise interfered with a foreign ship\u2019s internal\naffairs, the clear statement rule recognized in Benz and\nMcCulloch would come into play at that point. The Title\nIII requirement in question, however, would still apply to\ndomestic cruise ships, and Title III requirements having\nnothing to do with internal affairs would continue to apply\nto domestic and foreign ships alike.\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)          15\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n   This application-by-application use of the internal af-\nfairs clear statement rule is consistent with how the rule\nhas traditionally operated. In Benz and McCulloch, the\nCourt concluded that the NLRA did not apply to labor\nrelations between a foreign-flag ship and its foreign crew\nbecause of interference with the foreign ships\u2019 internal\naffairs. In Ariadne Shipping, however, the Court held\nthat the NLRA does apply to labor relations between a\nforeign-flag ship and American longshoremen. Ariadne\nShipping acknowledged the clear statement rule invoked\nin Benz and McCulloch but held that the \u201cconsiderations\nthat informed the Court\u2019s construction of the statute in\n[those cases] are clearly inapplicable\u201d to the question\nwhether the statute applies to foreign ships\u2019 labor rela-\ntions with American longshoremen. 397 U. S., at 199.\nAriadne Shipping held that the longshoremen\u2019s \u201cshort-\nterm, irregular and casual connection with the [foreign]\nvessels plainly belied any involvement on their part with\nthe ships\u2019 \u2018internal discipline and order.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 200.\nTherefore, application of the NLRA to foreign ships\u2019 rela-\ntions with American longshoremen \u201cwould have threat-\nened no interference in the internal affairs of foreign-flag\nships.\u201d Ibid. If the clear statement rule restricts some\napplications of the NLRA to foreign ships (e.g., labor rela-\ntions with the foreign crew), but not others (e.g., labor\nrelations with American longshoremen), it follows that the\ncase-by-case application is also required under Title III of\nthe ADA. The rule, where it is even necessary to invoke it,\nwould restrict some applications of Title III to foreign\nships (e.g., certain structural barrier modification re-\nquirements), but not others (e.g., the prohibition on dis-\ncriminatory ticket pricing).\n   The internal affairs clear statement rule is an implied\nlimitation on otherwise unambiguous general terms of the\nstatute. It operates much like the principle that general\nstatutes are construed not to apply extraterritorially,\n16       SPECTOR v. NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD.\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nEEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 260\n(1991), or the rule that general statutes are presumed not\nto impose monetary liability on nonconsenting States,\nAtascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234\n(1985). Implied limitation rules avoid applications of\notherwise unambiguous statutes that would intrude on\nsensitive domains in a way that Congress is unlikely to\nhave intended had it considered the matter. In these\ninstances, the absence of a clear congressional statement\nis, in effect, equivalent to a statutory qualification saying,\nfor example, \u201cNotwithstanding any general language of\nthis statute, this statute shall not apply extraterritori-\nally\u201d; or \u201c. . . this statute shall not abrogate the sovereign\nimmunity of nonconsenting States\u201d; or \u201c. . . this statute\ndoes not regulate the internal affairs of foreign-flag ves-\nsels.\u201d These clear statement rules ensure Congress does\nnot, by broad or general language, legislate on a sensitive\ntopic inadvertently or without due deliberation. An all-or-\nnothing approach, under which a statute is altogether\ninapplicable if but one of its specific applications trenches\non the domain protected by a clear statement rule, would\nconvert the clear statement rule from a principle of inter-\npretive caution into a trap for an unwary Congress. If\nCongress passes broad legislation that has some applica-\ntions that implicate a clear statement rule\u2014say, some\nextraterritorial applications, or some applications that\nwould regulate foreign ships\u2019 internal affairs\u2014an all-or-\nnothing approach would require that the entire statute, or\nsome arbitrary set of applications larger than the domain\nprotected by the clear statement rule, would be nullified.\nWe decline to adopt that posture.\n                             B\n  Our holding that the clear statement rule operates only\nwhen a ship\u2019s internal affairs are affected does not impli-\ncate our holding in Clark v.

This was\nsimply a rule of consistent interpretation of the statu-\ntory words, with no bearing on the implementation of a\nclear statement rule addressed to particular statutory\napplications.\n   The statute in Martinez, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71231(a)(6), author-\nized detention of aliens pending their removal. In Zadvy-\ndas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, 696\u2013699 (2001), the Court had\ninterpreted this statute to impose time limits on detention\nof aliens held for certain reasons stated in the statute.\nThe Court held that an alternative interpretation, one\nallowing indefinite detention of lawfully admitted aliens,\nwould raise grave constitutional doubts. Having deter-\nmined the meaning of \u00a71231(a)(6)\u2019s text in Zadvydas, we\nwere obliged in Martinez to follow the same interpretation\neven in a context where the constitutional concerns were\nnot present. Martinez, 543 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5\u20139).\nAs already made clear, the question was one of textual\ninterpretation, not the scope of some implied exception.\nThe constitutional avoidance canon simply informed the\nchoice among plausible readings of \u00a71231(a)(6)\u2019s text: \u201cThe\ncanon of constitutional avoidance,\u201d Martinez explained,\n\u201ccomes into play only when, after the application of ordi-\nnary textual analysis, the statute is found to be suscepti-\nble of more than one construction; and the canon functions\nas a means of choosing between them.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 13) (emphasis deleted).\n   Martinez gives full respect to the distinction between\nrules for resolving textual ambiguity and implied limita-\ntions on otherwise unambiguous text. Indeed, Martinez\nrelies on the distinction to reconcile its holding with two\ncases which did involve a clear statement rule, Raygor v.\n18        SPECTOR v. NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD.\n\n                      Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nRegents of Univ. of Minn., 534 U. S. 533 (2002), and Jinks\nv. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456 (2003). Raygor had\nheld that the tolling provision in the supplemental juris-\ndiction statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71367(d), does not apply to\nnonconsenting States because the statute lacks the re-\nquired clear statement that States are within its coverage.\nLater, in Jinks, we held that the \u00a71367(d) tolling provision\ndoes apply to suits against counties. The counties were\nnot protected by a clear statement rule analogous to the\none applicable to States. See Martinez, 543 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 11\u201312, and n. 6); see also id., at ___ (slip op., at\n6\u20138) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). \u201cThis progression of deci-\nsions,\u201d we held in Martinez, \u201cdoes not remotely establish\nthat \u00a71367(d) has two different meanings, equivalent to\nthe unlimited-detention/limited-detention meanings of\n\u00a71231(a)(6) urged upon us here. They hold that the single\nand unchanging disposition of \u00a71367(d) . . . does not apply\nto claims against States that have not consented to be\nsued in federal court.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12). The\ndistinction between Zadvydas and Martinez, on the one\nhand, and Raygor and Jinks, on the other, is the distinc-\ntion between a canon for choosing among plausible mean-\nings of an ambiguous statute and a clear statement rule\nthat implies a special substantive limit on the application\nof an otherwise unambiguous mandate.\n   The internal affairs clear statement rule is an implied\nlimitation rule, not a principle for resolving textual ambi-\nguity. Our cases, then, do not compel or permit the con-\nclusion that if any one application of Title III might inter-\nfere with a foreign-flag ship\u2019s internal affairs, Title III is\ninapplicable to foreign ships in every other instance.\n                      *    *    *\n  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that\ngeneral statutes do not apply to foreign-flag ships in\nUnited States waters.

NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD.\n\n                        Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nshould not be hemmed in where there is no potential for\ninternational discord.1\n   The first of the modern cases to address the application\nof a domestic statute to a foreign-flag ship in U. S. waters,\nBenz v. Compania Naviera Hidalgo, S. A., 353 U. S. 138\n(1957), did not resort to the tag, \u201cinternal affairs\u201d rule, to\nexplain the Court\u2019s decision.2 Benz held that the Labor\nManagement Relations Act did not reach relations be-\ntween \u201ca foreign employer and a foreign crew operating\nunder an agreement made abroad under the laws of an-\nother nation.\u201d Id., at 142. As we concluded in Benz, before\nreading our law to \u201crun interference in such a delicate\nfield of international relations,\u201d \u201cwhere the possibilities of\ninternational discord are so evident and retaliative action\nso certain,\u201d the Court should await Congress\u2019 clearly ex-\npressed instruction. Id., at 147.\n   Six years later, in McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de\nMarineros de Honduras, 372 U. S. 10 (1963), the Court\nrelied on Benz to hold that the National Labor Relations Act\ndoes not regulate the representation of alien seamen re-\ncruited in Honduras to serve aboard vessels under Hondu-\nran flags. Applying our law \u201cto the internal management\nand affairs\u201d of the vessels in question, we observed,\nMcCulloch, 372 U. S., at 20, would produce a \u201chead-on\ncollision\u201d with the regulatory regime installed under the\nHonduran labor code, id., at 21. \u201c[S]uch highly charged\ninternational circumstances,\u201d we said, called for adherence\nto the venerable interpretive guide that \u201c \u2018an act of Congress\nought never to be construed to violate the law of nations if\nany other possible construction remains.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.

S. ports is proper because\ndoing so \u201cwould . . . threate[n] no interference in the internal\naffairs of foreign-flag ships likely to lead to conflict with\nforeign or international law\u201d).\n   The noninterference principle underlying the internal\naffairs clear statement rule is served in this case by the\nCourt\u2019s interpretation of Title III\u2019s \u201creadily achievable\u201d\nprovision, 42 U. S. C. \u00a712182(b)(2)(A)(iv). See ante, at 12\u2013\n13. Construing this language to allow ships to resist\nmodifications \u201cthat would conflict with international legal\nobligations,\u201d ante, at 13, the Court ensures that Title III\nwill not provoke \u201cinternational discord\u201d of the kind Benz\nand McCulloch sought to avoid. I agree with this interpre-\ntation, but would create no larger space for the internal\naffairs rule.\n   The plurality, however, suggests that the clear state-\nment rule has a further office: It may block structural\nmodifications prompted by Title III that are \u201creadily\nachievable\u201d\u2014because they do not conflict with interna-\ntional legal obligations\u2014but nonetheless \u201cinterfer[e] with\na foreign ship\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d Ante, at 14. I disagree\nwith this conception of the rule. In positing an extended\napplication of the internal affairs rule, the plurality cuts\nthe rule loose from its foundation. As Benz and McCulloch\ndemonstrate, the clear statement rule is an interpretive\nprinciple counseling against construction of a statute in a\nmanner productive of international discord. When inter-\nnational relations are not at risk, and there is good reason\nto apply our own law, asserted internal affairs of a ship\nshould hold no greater sway than asserted management\nprerogatives of a landlocked enterprise.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 3 One   could hardly anticipate that, absent conflict with international\n4          SPECTOR v.

See ante, at 8\u20139;\n\u00a712101(b). The United States has a strong interest in en-\nsuring that U. S. resident cruise passengers enjoy Title III\u2019s\nprotections on both domestic and foreign ships. See \u00a712101;\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 10.4 Once conflicts\nwith international legal obligations are avoided, I see no\nreason to demand a clearer congressional statement that\nTitle III reaches the vessels in question, ships that regularly\nsail to and from U. S. ports and derive most of their income\nfrom U. S. passengers. In sum, I agree that \u00a712182(b)\n(2)(A)(iv), properly read, does not require shipowners to\nmake modifications that would conflict with international\nlegal obligations. But I would attribute to the internal\naffairs clear statement rule no further limitation on Title\nIII\u2019s governance in this case.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nlegal obligations, the application of Title III sought in this case would\ngenerate a \u201cstorm of diplomatic protest.\u201d Id., at 146 (noting \u201cstorm of\ndiplomatic protest\u201d against proposal to apply U.

I agree with JUSTICE SCALIA\nthat this rule applies to any structural changes to a ship\nthat Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of\n1990 (ADA) might require, for such changes to a ship\u2019s\nphysical structure pertain to its internal affairs. Post, at\n2\u20134 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); see ante, at 11 (plurality\nopinion). I further agree with JUSTICE SCALIA that this\nclear statement rule applies once the possibility, rather\nthan the certainty, of international discord arises; and\nthat the clear statement rule therefore does not require or\npermit the kind of express conflicts-of-law analysis that\nthe plurality demands. Post, at 4\u20136 (SCALIA, J., dissent-\ning); ante, at 12\u201313 (majority opinion). Moreover, I do not\nthink that courts should (as the plurality permits) employ\nthe rule selectively, applying it when \u201cprudent\u201d but declin-\ning to apply it when \u201cappropriate.\u201d Ante, at 13\u201314 (plural-\nity opinion); see also post, at 10, n. 8 (SCALIA, J., dissent-\ning); Small v.

NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nwhen modified in ways that Congress could never have\nimagined\u201d). For those reasons, I join part I\u2013A of JUSTICE\nSCALIA\u2019s dissent. While I conclude that the rule applies to\ncertain aspects of Title III, I agree with the plurality that\nit does not require an \u201call-or-nothing approach.\u201d Ante, at\n16. Consequently, those applications of Title III that do\nnot pertain to internal affairs apply to foreign-flag vessels.\nFor that reason, I join part IIIA of the plurality opinion.\n   I reach this result, however, only because I continue to\nreject the \u201clowest common denominator\u201d principle the\nCourt articulated for the first time in Clark v. Martinez,\n544 U. S. ___ (2005). See id., at ___ (slip op., at 9\u201311)\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting). The Court, by contrast, accepts\nClark. Moreover, it claims that applying Title III of the\nADA to matters that are not within the realm of a ship\u2019s\ninternal order is consistent with Clark. The plurality\u2019s\nefforts to distinguish Clark are implausible.\n   The plurality says that today\u2019s case differs from Clark\nbecause it invokes a clear statement rule to interpret\nunambiguous text. According to the plurality, Clark\nconcerned the application of a previously adopted limiting\nconstruction of ambiguous text, which this Court imposed\nto ameliorate unrelated constitutional doubts. Ante, at\n16\u201317. As an initial matter, however, the statute at issue\nin Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678 (2001) and Clark was\nnot ambiguous. Clark, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 16\u201317)\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting). Even assuming for the sake of\nargument that it was ambiguous, the distinction the plu-\nrality draws has no basis in Clark. In Clark, this Court\naddressed the period of detention 8 U. S. C. \u00a71231(a)(6)\nauthorized for inadmissible aliens. This was a question\nleft open by Zadvydas, supra, which had addressed the\nperiod of detention under the same statute but with re-\nspect to a different class of aliens\u2014those who had been\nadmitted into the country. In Zadvydas, this Court had\n                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            3\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nconcluded that the possibility of indefinite detention of\nadmitted aliens raised significant constitutional doubts\nand, in light of those doubts, it limited the Attorney Gen-\neral\u2019s power to detain admitted aliens. 533 U. S., at 689\u2013\n690, 699. Section 1231(a)(6) does not distinguish between\nthe two classes of aliens. Thus, this Court in Clark con-\ncluded it was compelled to apply that same construction,\nwhich was warranted only by the specific constitutional\nconcerns arising for admitted aliens, to the unadmitted\naliens before it. 543 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 8). Clark\u2019s\nconclusion stemmed from the narrowing construction\nadopted in Zadvydas, not the type of rule or canon that\ngave rise to that construction. 543 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 6\u20137).\n   The plurality\u2019s reasoning cannot be squared with\nClark\u2019s \u201clowest common denominator\u201d principle. Under\nClark, \u201c[t]he lowest common denominator, as it were, must\ngovern.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8). Just as in Zadvydas\nand Clark, this Court is called upon to interpret the same\nstatutory text with respect to two different classes of\ncases\u2014those that implicate the internal affairs of a vessel\nand those that do not. And just like the statute at issue in\nZadvydas and Clark, Title III \u201capplies without differentia-\ntion\u201d to the internal and external affairs of foreign-flag\nvessels, as well as the internal and external affairs of\ndomestic-flag ships. 543 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6).\nThus, the limiting construction of Title III\u2019s definitions\nexcluding foreign cruise ships from those definitions must\ngovern all applications of the statute, not just those appli-\ncations that pertain to internal affairs. According to\nClark, the Court may not narrow Title III on a case-by-\ncase basis, depending on whether a particular application\nof Title III interferes with a ship\u2019s internal order. In fact,\nit may not apply Title III to any ship or, for that matter,\nany entity at all, because Title III does not distinguish\nbetween any of the covered entities. This demonstrates\n4        SPECTOR v. NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nwhy the principle Clark established is flawed.\n   Today\u2019s decision, then, cabins the Clark principle to\napply only when the canon of constitutional avoidance is\ninvoked to choose among ambiguous readings of a statute.\nBut even here Clark will continue to make mischief. As I\nexplained in Clark, the lowest common denominator prin-\nciple requires courts to search out a single hypothetical\nconstitutionally doubtful case to limit a statute\u2019s terms in\nthe wholly different case actually before the court, lest the\ncourt fail to adopt a reading of the statute that reflects the\nlowest common denominator. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14)\n(dissent). This requires a reverse-Salerno analysis that\nupends our facial challenge requirements. See Clark,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 10); see also United States v.\nSalerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987) (for a facial challenge to\nsucceed, there must be no circumstance in which the\nstatute is constitutional). For this and other reasons I\nhave explained, the Clark analysis allows much havoc to\nbe wrought from the canon of constitutional avoidance.\nSee Clark, supra, at __ (slip op., at 10\u201315) (dissent).\n   In sum, I believe that Title III of the ADA, insofar as it\nrequires structural changes, lacks a sufficiently clear\nstatement that it applies to the internal affairs of foreign\nvessels. In my view the clear statement rule does not\nrender Title III entirely inapplicable to foreign vessels;\ninstead, Title III applies to foreign ships only to the extent\nto which it does not bear on their internal affairs. I there-\nfore would remand for consideration of those Title III\nclaims that do not pertain to the structure of the ship.\nAccordingly, I concur in part III A of the plurality opinion,\njoin part I A of JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s dissent, and concur in the\njudgment in part.\n                 Cite as: 545 U.

The plurality correctly recognizes\nthat Congress must clearly express its intent to apply its\nlaws to foreign-flag ships when those laws interfere with\nthe ship\u2019s internal order. Its attempt to place Title III of\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), outside\nthis rule through creative statutory interpretation and\npiecemeal application of its provisions is unsupported by\nour case law. Title III plainly affects the internal order of\nforeign-flag cruise ships, subjecting them to the possibility\nof conflicting international obligations. I would hold that,\nsince there is no clear statement of coverage, Title III does\nnot apply to foreign-flag cruise ships.\n                              I\n                              A\n   As the plurality explains, where a law would interfere\nwith the regulation of a ship\u2019s internal order, we require a\nclear statement that Congress intended such a result. See\nante, at 6. This rule is predicated on the \u201crule of interna-\ntional law that the law of the flag ship ordinarily governs\nthe internal affairs of a ship,\u201d McCulloch v.

S. 138, 147 (1957); see also McCulloch, supra, at 19.\n  The clear-statement rule finds support not only in Benz\nand McCulloch, but in cases like Cunard S. S. Co. v. Mel-\nlon, 262 U. S. 100, 128\u2013129 (1923), where we held that the\nNational Prohibition Act, 41 Stat. 305, forbade foreign-flag\nships from carrying or serving alcohol in United States\nterritorial waters. Though we did not say so expressly in\nthat case, prohibiting the carrying and serving of alcohol\nin United States waters cannot be said to affect the \u201cin-\nternal order\u201d of the ship, because it does not in any way\naffect the operation or functioning of the craft.1 Similarly,\nin Lauritzen v. Larsen, 345 U. S. 571 (1953), and Hellenic\nLines Ltd. v. Rhoditis, 398 U. S. 306 (1970), we did not\nemploy a clear-statement rule in determining whether\nforeign seamen injured aboard foreign-flag ships could\nrecover under the Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U. S. C.\nApp. \u00a7688. We distinguished these cases in McCulloch,\nexplaining that a clear statement is not required \u201cin dif-\nferent contexts, such as the Jones Act . . . where the perva-\nsive regulation of the internal order of a ship may not be\npresent.\u201d 372 U.

Cunard\nS. S. Co. v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 100, 127 (1923) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   2 The plurality intimates that the clear-statement rule might be inap-\n\nplicable in situations where, as here, the foreign-flag ships have a\nnumber of contacts with the United States. See ante, at 8. McCulloch,\n372 U. S., at 19, expressly rejected this approach, explaining that any\nattempt to weigh the ship\u2019s contacts with the United States \u201cwould\ninevitably lead to embarrassment in foreign affairs and would be entirely\ninfeasible in actual practice.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 545 U.

S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a712182(b)(2)(A)(iv), 12184(b)(2)(C), would plainly affect\nthe ship\u2019s \u201cinternal order.\u201d Rendering exterior cabins\nhandicapped-accessible, changing the levels of coamings,\nand adding public restrooms\u2014the types of modifications\npetitioners request\u2014would require alteration of core\nphysical aspects of the ship, some of which relate to safety.\n(Safety has, under international law, traditionally been\nthe province of a ship\u2019s flag state.) This is quite different\nfrom prohibiting alcohol in United States waters or impos-\ning tort liability for injuries sustained on foreign ships in\nport\u2014the laws at issue in Cunard and the Jones Act cases.\nThose restrictions affected the ship only in limited circum-\nstances, and in ways ancillary to its operation at sea. A\nship\u2019s design and construction, by contrast, are at least as\nintegral to the ship\u2019s operation and functioning as the\nbargaining relationship between shipowner and crew at\nissue in Benz and McCulloch.\n  Moreover, the structural changes petitioners request\nwould be permanent. Whereas a ship precluded from\nserving or carrying alcohol in United States waters may\ncertainly carry and serve alcohol on its next trip from Italy\nto Greece, structural modifications made to comply with\nAmerican laws cannot readily be removed once the ship\nleaves our waters and ceases to carry American passen-\ngers. This is again much like the situation presented in\nBenz and McCulloch, where the application of American\nlabor laws would have continued to govern contracts be-\ntween foreign shipowners and their foreign crews well\nbeyond their time in our waters.\n  The purpose of the \u201cinternal order\u201d clear-statement\nrequirement is to avoid casually subjecting oceangoing\nvessels to laws that pose obvious risks of conflict with the\nlaws of the ship\u2019s flag state, the laws of other nations, and\n4        SPECTOR v.

S., at 21 (emphasis\nadded), gives rise to the presumption of noncoverage\nabsent clear statement to the contrary.\n   The Court asserts that Title III would not produce con-\nflicts with the requirements of SOLAS and would not\ncompromise safety concerns. This argument comes at the\nexpense of an expansive en passant interpretation of the\nexceptions to the barrier-removal requirements of Title\nIII\u2014which interpretation will likely have more significant\nnationwide effects than the Court\u2019s holding concerning\nTitle III\u2019s application to foreign-flag vessels. Assuming,\nhowever, that the argument is even correct,3 it is entirely\nbeside the point. It has never been a condition for applica-\ntion of the foreign-flag clear-statement rule that an actual\nconflict with foreign or international law be established\u2014\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 This is by no means clear. Title III defines \u201creadily achievable\u201d as\n\n\u201ceasily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much diffi-\nculty or expense.\u201d \u00a712181(9). It is, at best, ambiguous whether a\nbarrier removal can be rendered not \u201ceasily accomplishable\u201d or not\n\u201cable to be carried out without much difficulty\u201d by factors extrinsic to\nthe removal itself. Conflict of an easily altered structure with foreign\nlaws seems to me not much different from the tendency of an easily\naltered structure to deter customers. That is why, as suggested in text,\nthe Court\u2019s unexpected Title III holding may be the most significant\naspect of today\u2019s foreign-flag decision.\n6          SPECTOR v. NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD.\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nany more than that has been a condition for application of\nthe clear-statement rule regarding extraterritorial effect of\ncongressional enactments. The reason to apply the rule\nhere is that the structure of a ship pertains to the ship\u2019s\ninternal order, which is a matter presumably left to the\nflag state unless Congress indicates otherwise. The basis\nfor that presumption of congressional intent is principally\n(though perhaps not exclusively) that subjecting such\nmatters to the commands of various jurisdictions raises\nthe possibility (not necessarily the certainty) of conflict\namong jurisdictions and with international treaties. Even\nif the Court could, by an imaginative interpretation of\nTitle III, demonstrate that in this particular instance\nthere would be no conflict with the laws of other nations or\nwith international treaties,4 it would remain true that a\nship\u2019s structure is preeminently part of its internal order;\nand it would remain true that subjecting ship structure to\nmultiple national requirements invites conflict. That is\nwhat triggers application of the clear-statement rule.\n   Safety concerns\u2014and specifically safety as related to\nship structure\u2014are traditionally the responsibility of the\nflag state. Which is to say they are regarded as part of the\nship\u2019s internal order. And even if Title III makes ample\nprovision for a safety exception to the barrier-removal\nrequirements, what it considers necessary for safety is not\nnecessarily what other nations or international treaties\nconsider necessary.\n   The foregoing renders quite unnecessary the Court\u2019s\nworry that Title III might require American cruise ships\nto adhere to Congress\u2019s prescription in violation of SOLAS.\nSee ante, at 12. If and when that possibility presents\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The Court, of course, has not even shown that Title III is consistent\n\nwith the laws of the cruise ships\u2019 flag state; much less has it under-\ntaken the Herculean task\u2014which its theory of presumed coverage by\ndomestic law would require\u2014of showing Title III consistent with the\nlaws of all the cruise ships\u2019 ports of call.\n                     Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                     7\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nitself, the Court remains free to do what it does here: to\ninterpret Title III so as to avoid any conflict. But the\navailability of such an interpretation has no bearing upon\nwhether the structural features of an oceangoing vessel\nare part of its internal order. (I must observe, however,\nthat it seems much more plausible that Congress intended\nto require American cruise ships to adhere to Title III\nregardless of SOLAS, than that\u2014what the Court appar-\nently believes\u2014Congress intended Title III to be inter-\npreted with an eye to SOLAS.) In any event, the applica-\ntion of Title III to oceangoing vessels under American flag\nis not at issue here. I would therefore hold that, because\nTitle III\u2019s barrier-removal provisions clearly have the\npossibility of subjecting foreign-flag ships to conflicting\ninternational obligations, no reading of Title III\u2014no mat-\nter how creative\u2014can alter the presumption that Title III\ndoes not apply to foreign-flag ships without a clear state-\nment from Congress.5\n                               B\n    The plurality holds that, even \u201c[i]f Title III did impose a\nduty that required [foreign-flag] cruise ships to make per-\nmanent and significant structural modifications[,] or . . .\notherwise interfered with a foreign ship\u2019s internal affairs\n. . . Title III requirements having nothing to do with inter-\nnal affairs would continue to apply to domestic and foreign\nships alike.\u201d Ante, at 14. I disagree. Whether or not Title\nIII\u2019s prescriptions regarding such matters implicate the\n\u201cinternal order\u201d of the ship, they still relate to the ships\u2019\nmaritime operations and are part of the same Title III.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Of course this clear-statement rule would not apply to the onshore\n\noperations of foreign cruise companies, which would be treated no\ndifferently from the operations of other foreign companies on American\nsoil.\n  6 This includes the pricing and ticketing policies, which are intimately\n\nrelated to the ships\u2019 maritime operations (and perhaps to internal\n8         SPECTOR v.

It is not within our power\nto design a statute some of whose provisions apply to\nforeign-flag ships and other of whose provisions do not\u2014\nany more than it is within our power to prescribe that the\nstatute applies to foreign-flag cruise ships 60% of whose\npassengers are United States citizens and does not apply\nto other foreign-flag cruise ships.\n   The plurality\u2019s assertion that those portions of Title III\nthat do not implicate a ship\u2019s internal order apply to for-\neign-flag ships displays a confusion between a principle of\ninterpretation based upon a true-to-fact presumption of\ncongressional intent, and a court-made rule. The plurality\nseems to forget that it is a matter of determining whether\nCongress in fact intended that its enactment cover foreign-\nflag ships. To believe that there was any such intent\nsection-by-section and paragraph-by-paragraph is delu-\nsional. Either Congress enacted Title III only with domes-\ntic entities (and not foreign-flag ships) in mind, or it in-\ntended Title III to apply across-the-board. It could not\npossibly be the real congressional intent that foreign-flag\ncruise ships be considered \u201cplace[s] of public accommoda-\ntion\u201d or \u201cspecified public transportation\u201d for purposes of\ncertain provisions but not for others. That Congress had\nseparate foreign-flag intent with respect to each require-\nment\u2014and would presumably adopt a clear statement\nprovision-by-provision\u2014is utterly implausible. And far\nfrom its being the case that this creates \u201ca trap for an\nunwary Congress,\u201d ante, at 16, it is the plurality\u2019s disposi-\ntion that, in piecemeal fashion, applies to foreign-flag\nships provisions never enacted with foreign-flag vessels in\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\norder) because they are designed to defray the added cost and provide\nthe added protection that the cruise-ship companies deem necessary for\nsafe transport of disabled passengers.\n                     Cite as: 545 U.

S. ___ (2005), where we explained that\na statutory provision must be interpreted consistently\nfrom case to case. \u201cIt is not at all unusual to give a\nstatut[e] . . . a limiting construction called for by one of the\nstatute\u2019s applications, even though other of the statute\u2019s\napplications, standing alone, would not support the same\nlimitation.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8). That principle\nshould apply here. Since some applications of Title III\nplainly affect the internal order of foreign-flag ships, the\nabsence of a clear statement renders the statute inappli-\ncable\u2014even though some applications of the statute, if\nsevered from the rest, would not require clear statement.\n   This does not mean that a clear statement is required\nwhenever a court applies Title III to any entity\u2014only that\na clear statement is required to apply any part of Title III\nto foreign-flag ships. Raygor v. Regents of Univ. of Minn.,\n534 U. S. 533 (2002), and Jinks v. Richland County, 538\nU. S. 456 (2003), do not dictate otherwise. Raygor held\nthat 28 U. S.

Ariadne Shipping Co.,\n\n397 U. S. 195 (1970), is misleading. Although Ariadne clearly recog-\nnized the existence of an internal-order rule in our case law, see id., at\n200, Ariadne did not hold, similarly to what the plurality holds here,\nthat application of the foreign-flag clear-statement rule prevented some\nprovisions of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) from being\napplied to foreign-flag ships but allowed others to be applied. Rather, it\nheld that the clear-statement rule did not apply at all to activities that\nwere not \u201cwithin the \u2018maritime operations of foreign-flag ships.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\nThe case is relevant only to questions the Court does not decide here\u2014\nnamely, application of Title III to onshore operations of the foreign-flag\nships. It is not relevant to the question whether all maritime activities\nare exempt from Title III for lack of a clear statement.\n10         SPECTOR v. NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD.\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nstatement requirement applies to those entities. In other\nwords, a clear statement is required to apply \u00a71367(d) to\nStates, just as a clear statement is required to apply Title\nIII to foreign-flag ships. A clear statement is not required to\napply \u00a71367(d) to political subdivisions of States, just as a\nclear statement is not required to apply Title III to domestic\nships or other domestic entities. The question in each of\nthese cases is whether the statute at issue covers certain\nentities, not whether some provisions of a statute cover a\ngiven entity.\n   The fine-tuning of legislation that the plurality requires\nwould be better left to Congress. To attempt it through\nthe process of case-by-case adjudication is a recipe for\nendless litigation and confusion. The plurality\u2019s resolution\nof today\u2019s case proves the point. It requires this Title III\nclaimant (and every other one who brings a claim against\na foreign shipowner) to show that each particular remedy\nhe seeks does not implicate the internal order of the ship.\nThat showing, where structural modification is involved,\nwould not only require the district court to determine\nwhat is \u201creadily achievable,\u201d ante, at 12\u201314, and what\nwould \u201cpose \u2018a significant risk to the health or safety of\nothers,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 13 (quoting \u00a712182(b)(3)), but would also\nrequire it to determine the obligations imposed by foreign\nlaw and international treaties.8 All this to establish the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The plurality attempts to simplify this inquiry by explaining that, if\n\nit is \u201ca difficult question whether a particular Title III barrier removal\nrequirement is readily achievable, but the requirement does entail a\npermanent and significant structural modification, interfering with a\nforeign ship\u2019s internal affairs[,] a court sensibly could invoke the clear\nstatement rule without determining whether Title III actually imposes\nthe requirement.\u201d Ante, at 14. It is impossible to reconcile this with\nthe plurality\u2019s rationale, which excludes the clear-statement rule when\nthere is no actual conflict with foreign law. On the plurality\u2019s own\nanalysis, significant structural modifications are least likely to pose an\nactual conflict with foreign law, since they are most likely to be re-\ngarded as (under the plurality\u2019s new Title III jurisprudence) not \u201cread-\n                      Cite as: 545 U.

If Congress desires to impose this\ntime-consuming and intricate process, it is certainly able\nto do so\u2014though I think it would likely prefer some more\nmanageable solution.9 But for the plurality to impose it as\na novel consequence of the venerable clear-statement rule\nseems to me unreasonable. I would therefore decline to\napply all of Title III to foreign-flag ships without a clear\nstatement from Congress.\n                              II\n  As the Court appears to concede, neither the \u201cpublic\naccommodation\u201d provision nor the \u201cspecified public trans-\nportation\u201d provision of Title III clearly covers foreign-flag\ncruise ships. The former prohibits discrimination \u201con the\nbasis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the\ngoods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or ac-\ncommodations of any place of public accommodation by\nany person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a\nplace of public accommodation.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a712182(a).\nThough Congress gave a seemingly exhaustive list of\nentities constituting \u201cpublic accommodation[s]\u201d\u2014including\ninns, hotels, restaurants, theaters, banks, zoos, and laun-\ndromats\u2014it failed to mention ships, much less foreign-flag\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nily achievable\u201d and hence not required. I am at a loss to understand\nwhat the plurality has in mind.\n   9 After this Court concluded, in EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co.,\n\n499 U. S. 244, 260 (1991), (ARAMCO), that Title VII of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964, does not protect American citizens working for American\nemployers in foreign countries, Congress amended Title VII. Unlike what\nwould have been this Court\u2019s only available resolution of the issue had it\ncome to the opposite conclusion in ARAMCO\u2014that Title VII applies to all\nAmerican employers operating abroad\u2014Congress was able to craft a more\nnuanced solution by exempting employers if compliance with Title VII\nwould run afoul of the law in the country where the workplace was\nlocated. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20131(b); cf. \u00a712112(c)(1) (same disposition for\nTitle I of the ADA).\n12       SPECTOR v.

Particularly where Congress has\nprovided such detailed specification, this is not a clear\nstatement that foreign-flag ships are covered. Petitioners\nalso claim that, because cruise ships are essentially float-\ning hotels that contain restaurants and other facilities\nexplicitly named in \u00a712181(7), they should be covered.\nWhile this may support the argument that cruise ships are\n\u201cpublic accommodations,\u201d it does not support the position\nthat Congress intended to reach foreign-flag cruise ships.\n   The \u201cspecified public transportation\u201d provision prohibits\ndiscrimination on the basis of disability \u201cin the full and\nequal enjoyment of specified public transportation services\nprovided by a private entity that is primarily engaged in\nthe business of transporting people and whose operations\naffect commerce.\u201d \u00a712184(a). The definition of \u201cspecified\npublic transportation\u201d includes \u201ctransportation by bus,\nrail, or any other conveyance (other than by aircraft) that\nprovides the general public with general or special service\n(including charter service) on a regular and continuing\nbasis.\u201d \u00a712181(10). \u201c[A]ny other conveyance\u201d clearly\ncovers ships. But even if the statute specifically men-\ntioned ships, that would not be a clear statement that\nforeign-flag ships are included\u2014any more than the refer-\nence to \u201cemployer\u201d in the NLRA constituted a clear state-\nment that foreign-flag ship employers were covered, see\nMcCulloch, 372 U. S., at 19\u201321.\n   Title III of the ADA stands in contrast to other statutes\nin which Congress has made clear its intent to extend its\nlaws to foreign ships. For example, the Maritime Drug\nLaw Enforcement Act, 94 Stat. 1159, 46 U. S. C.

S. C. \u00a7 12181 <i>et seq.,</i> applies to foreign-flag cruise ships in United States waters. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held Title III did not apply because of a presumption, which it sought to derive from this Court's case law, that, absent a clear indication of congressional intent, general statutes do not apply to foreign-flag ships. 356 F. 3d 641, 644-646 (2004). The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, on the other hand, has held that the ADA does apply to foreign-flag cruise ships in United States waters. See <i>Stevens v. Premier Cruises, Inc.,</i> 215 F. 3d 1237 (2000). We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 542 U. S. 965 (2004).</p>\n<p>Our cases hold that a clear statement of congressional intent is necessary before a general statutory requirement can interfere with matters that concern a foreign-flag vessel's internal affairs and operations, as contrasted with statutory requirements that concern the security and well-being of United States citizens or territory. While the clear statement rule could limit Title III's application to foreign-flag cruise ships in some instances, when it requires removal of physical barriers, it would appear the rule is inapplicable to many other duties Title III might impose. We therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that the ADA is altogether inapplicable to foreign vessels, and we remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*126</span> I</h2>\n<p>The respondent Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd. (NCL), a Bermuda corporation with a principal place of business in Miami, Florida, operates cruise ships that depart from, and return to, ports in the United States. The ships are essentially floating resorts. They provide passengers with staterooms or cabins, food, and entertainment. The cruise ships stop at different ports of call where passengers may disembark. Most of the passengers on these cruises are United States residents; under the terms and conditions of the tickets, disputes between passengers and NCL are to be governed by United States law; and NCL relies upon extensive advertising in the United States to promote its cruises and increase its revenues.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that the cruises are operated by a company based in the United States, serve predominantly United States residents, and are in most other respects United States-centered ventures, almost all of NCL's cruise ships are registered in other countries, flying so-called flags of convenience. The two NCL cruise ships that are the subject of the present litigation, the Norwegian Sea and the Norwegian Star, are both registered in the Bahamas.</p>\n<p>The petitioners are disabled individuals and their companions who purchased tickets in 1998 or 1999 for round-trip cruises on the Norwegian Sea or the Norwegian Star, with departures from Houston, Texas. Naming NCL as the defendant, the petitioners filed a class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas on behalf of all persons similarly situated. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief under Title III of the ADA, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability. The petitioners asserted that cruise ships are covered both by Title III's prohibition on discrimination in places of \"public accommodation,\" \u00a7 12182(a), and by its prohibition on discrimination in \"specified public transportation services,\" \u00a7 12184(a). Both provisions require covered entities to make \"reasonable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> modifications in policies, practices, or procedures\" to accommodate disabled individuals, \u00a7\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii), 12184(b)(2)(A), and require removal of \"architectural barriers, and communication barriers that are structural in nature,\" where such removal is \"readily achievable,\" \u00a7\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv), 12184(b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p>The District Court held that, as a general matter, Title III applies to foreign-flag cruise ships in United States territorial waters. Civ. Action No. H-00-2649 (SD Tex., Sept. 10, 2002), App. to Pet. for Cert. 35a. The District Court found, however, that the petitioners' claims regarding physical barriers to access could not go forward because the agencies charged with promulgating architectural and structural guidelines for ADA compliance (the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, the Department of Transportation, and the Department of Justice) had not done so for cruise ships. In these circumstances, the court held, it is unclear what structural modifications NCL would need to make. <i>Id.,</i> at 36a-42a. The District Court granted NCL's motion to dismiss the barrier-removal claims, but denied NCL's motion with respect to all the other claims. <i>Id.,</i> at 47a.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. It reasoned that our cases, particularly <i>Benz v. Compania Naviera Hidalgo, S. A.,</i> 353 U. S. 138 (1957), and <i>McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros de Honduras,</i> 372 U. S. 10 (1963), stand for the proposition that general statutes do not apply to foreign-flag vessels in United States territory absent a clear indication of congressional intent. 356 F. 3d, at 644 (\"[T]o apply domestic law to foreign vessels entering United States waters, there must be present the affirmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed\" (quoting <i>Benz, supra,</i> at 147 (internal quotation marks omitted))); 356 F. 3d, at 646 (<i>Benz</i> and <i>McCulloch</i> \"prohibit United States courts from applying domestic statutes to foreign-flagged ships without specific evidence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> of congressional intent\"). As Title III does not contain a specific provision mandating its application to foreign-flag vessels, the Court of Appeals sustained the District Court's dismissal of the petitioners' barrier-removal claims on this alternative ground and reversed the District Court on the remaining Title III claims. 356 F. 3d, at 650-651.</p>\n<p>The action was ordered dismissed for failure to state a claim, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6), before extensive discovery. We cannot then discuss the specific allegations in much detail but must confine our opinion to the relevant general principles. (On November 24, 2004, the responsible agencies finally did issue draft guidelines for large passenger vessels and a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. See 69 Fed. Reg. 69244, 69249. These developments are not dispositive of the legal question on which we granted certiorari, and we do not address how they might affect the ultimate resolution of the petitioners' claims.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination against the disabled in the full and equal enjoyment of public accommodations, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 12182(a), and public transportation services, \u00a7 12184(a). The general prohibitions are supplemented by various, more specific requirements. Entities that provide public accommodations or public transportation: (1) may not impose \"eligibility criteria\" that tend to screen out disabled individuals, \u00a7\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(i), 12184(b)(1); (2) must make \"reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when such modifications are necessary\" to provide disabled individuals full and equal enjoyment, \u00a7\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii), 12184(b)(2)(A); (3) must provide auxiliary aids and services to disabled individuals, \u00a7\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(iii), 12184(b)(2)(B); and (4) must remove architectural and structural barriers, or if barrier removal is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> not readily achievable, must ensure equal access for the disabled through alternative methods, \u00a7\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv)-(v), 12184(b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p>These specific requirements, in turn, are subject to important exceptions and limitations. Eligibility criteria that screen out disabled individuals are permitted when \"necessary for the provision\" of the services or facilities being offered, \u00a7\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(i), 12184(b)(1). Policies, practices, and procedures need not be modified, and auxiliary aids need not be provided, if doing so would \"fundamentally alter\" the services or accommodations being offered. \u00a7\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii)-(iii). Auxiliary aids are also unnecessary when they would \"result in an undue burden,\" \u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(iii). As we have noted, moreover, the barrier-removal and alternative access requirements do not apply when these requirements are not \"readily achievable,\" \u00a7\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv)-(v). Additionally, Title III does not impose non-discrimination or accommodation requirements if, as a result, disabled individuals would pose \"a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services,\" \u00a7 12182(b)(3).</p>\n<p>Although the statutory definitions of \"public accommodation\" and \"specified public transportation\" do not expressly mention cruise ships, there can be no serious doubt that the NCL cruise ships in question fall within both definitions under conventional principles of interpretation. \u00a7\u00a7 12181(7)(A)-(B), (I), (L), 12181(10). The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, nevertheless, held that Title III does not apply to foreign-flag cruise ships in United States waters because the statute has no clear statement or explicit text mandating coverage for these ships. This Court's cases, particularly <i>Benz</i> and <i>McCulloch,</i> do hold, in some circumstances, that a general statute will not apply to certain aspects of the internal operations of foreign vessels temporarily in United States waters, absent a clear statement. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> broad clear statement rule adopted by the Court of Appeals, however, would apply to every facet of the business and operations of foreign-flag ships. That formulation is inconsistent with the Court's case law and with sound principles of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>This Court has long held that general statutes are presumed to apply to conduct that takes place aboard a foreign-flag vessel in United States territory if the interests of the United States or its citizens, rather than interests internal to the ship, are at stake. See <i>Cunard S. S. Co. v. Mellon,</i> 262 U. S. 100, 127 (1923) (holding that the general terms of the National Prohibition Act apply to foreign-flag ships in United States waters because \"[t]here is in the act no provision making it [in]applicable\" to such ships); <i>Uravic v. F. Jarka Co.,</i> 282 U. S. 234, 240 (1931) (holding that \"general words\" should be \"generally applied\" and that therefore there is \"no reason for limiting the liability for torts committed [aboard foreign-flag ships in United States territory] when they go beyond the scope of discipline and private matters that do not interest the territorial power\"). The general rule that United States statutes apply to foreign-flag ships in United States territory is subject only to a narrow exception. Absent a clear statement of congressional intent, general statutes may not apply to foreign-flag vessels insofar as they regulate matters that involve only the internal order and discipline of the vessel, rather than the peace of the port. This qualification derives from the understanding that, as a matter of international comity, \"all matters of discipline and all things done on board which affec[t] only the vessel or those belonging to her, and [do] not involve the peace or dignity of the country, or the tranquility of the port, should be left by the local government to be dealt with by the authorities of the nation to which the vessel belonged.\" <i>Wildenhus's Case,</i> 120 U. S. 1, 12 (1887). This exception to the usual presumption, however, does not extend beyond <span class=\"star-pagination\">*131</span> matters of internal order and discipline. \"[I]f crimes are committed on board [a foreign-flag vessel] of a character to disturb the peace and tranquility of the country to which the vessel has been brought, the offenders have never by comity or usage been entitled to any exemption from the operation of the local laws.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The two cases in recent times in which the presumption against applying general statutes to foreign vessels' internal affairs has been invoked, <i>Benz</i> and <i>McCulloch,</i> concern labor relations. The Court held that the general terms of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 49 Stat. 449, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 151 <i>et seq.,</i> did not govern the respective rights and duties of a foreign ship and its crew because the NLRA standards would interfere with the foreign vessel's internal affairs in those circumstances. These cases recognized a narrow rule, applicable only to statutory duties that implicate the internal order of the foreign vessel rather than the welfare of American citizens. <i>McCulloch,</i> 372 U. S., at 21 (holding that \"the law of the flag state ordinarily governs the <i>internal affairs</i> of a ship\" (emphasis added)); see also <i>Benz,</i> 353 U. S., at 146-147. The Court held the NLRA inapplicable to labor relations between a foreign vessel and its foreign crew not because foreign ships are generally exempt from the NLRA, but because the particular application of the NLRA would interfere with matters that concern only the internal operations of the ship. In contrast, the Court held that the NLRA is fully applicable to labor relations between a foreign vessel and American longshoremen because this relationship, unlike the one between a vessel and its own crew, does not implicate a foreign ship's internal order and discipline. <i>Longshoremen v. Ariadne Shipping Co.,</i> 397 U. S. 195, 198-201 (1970).</p>\n<p>This narrow clear statement rule is supported by sound principles of statutory construction. It is reasonable to presume Congress intends no interference with matters that are primarily of concern only to the ship and the foreign state <span class=\"star-pagination\">*132</span> in which it is registered. It is also reasonable, however, to presume Congress does intend its statutes to apply to entities in United States territory that serve, employ, or otherwise affect American citizens, or that affect the peace and tranquility of the United States, even if those entities happen to be foreign-flag ships.</p>\n<p>Cruise ships flying foreign flags of convenience offer public accommodations and transportation services to over 7 million United States residents annually, departing from and returning to ports located in the United States. Large numbers of disabled individuals, many of whom have mobility impairments that make other kinds of vacation travel difficult, take advantage of these cruises or would like to do so. To hold there is no Title III protection for disabled persons who seek to use the amenities of foreign cruise ships would be a harsh and unexpected interpretation of a statute designed to provide broad protection for the disabled. \u00a7 12101. The clear statement rule adopted by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, moreover, would imply that other general federal statutes\u0097including, for example, Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 243, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000a <i>et seq.</i>\u0097would not apply aboard foreign cruise ships in United States waters. A clear statement rule with this sweeping application is unlikely to reflect congressional intent.</p>\n<p>The relevant category for which the Court demands a clear congressional statement, then, consists not of all applications of a statute to foreign-flag vessels but only those applications that would interfere with the foreign vessel's internal affairs. This proposition does not mean the clear statement rule is irrelevant to the ADA, however. If Title III by its terms does impose duties that interfere with a foreign-flag cruise ship's internal affairs, the lack of a clear congressional statement can mean that those specific applications of Title III are precluded. On remand, the Court of Appeals may need to consider which, if any, Title III requirements interfere <span class=\"star-pagination\">*133</span> with the internal affairs of foreign-flag vessels. As we will discuss further, however, Title III's own limitations and qualifications may make this inquiry unnecessary.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>The precise content of the category \"internal affairs\" (or, as it is variously denoted in the case law, \"internal order\" or \"internal operations\") is difficult to define with precision. There is, moreover, some ambiguity in our cases as to whether the relevant category of activities is restricted to matters that affect only the internal order of the ship when there is no effect on United States interests, or whether the clear statement rule further comes into play if the predominant effect of a statutory requirement is on a foreign ship's internal affairs but the requirement also promotes the welfare of United States residents or territory. We need not attempt to define the relevant protected category with precision. It suffices to observe that the guiding principles in determining whether the clear statement rule is triggered are the desire for international comity and the presumed lack of interest by the territorial sovereign in matters that bear no substantial relation to the peace and tranquility of the port.</p>\n<p>It is plain that Title III might impose any number of duties on cruise ships that have nothing to do with a ship's internal affairs. The pleadings and briefs in this case illustrate, but do not exhaust, the ways a cruise ship might offend such a duty. The petitioners allege the respondent charged disabled passengers higher fares and required disabled passengers to pay special surcharges, Plaintiffs' First Amended Original Complaint in No. H-00-2649 (SD Tex.), \u00b6 32, App. 15 (hereinafter Complaint); Brief for Petitioners 17-20; maintained evacuation programs and equipment in locations not accessible to disabled individuals, Complaint \u00b6 19, App. 12; Brief for Petitioners 21; required disabled individuals, but <span class=\"star-pagination\">*134</span> not other passengers, to waive any potential medical liability and to travel with a companion, <i>id.,</i> at 8, 17-18; and reserved the right to remove from the ship any disabled individual whose presence endangers the \"comfort\" of other passengers, <i>id.,</i> at 8, 20. The petitioners also allege more generally that the respondent \"failed to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, and procedures\" necessary to ensure the petitioners' full enjoyment of the services the respondent offered. Complaint \u00b6 30, App. 15. These are bare allegations, and their truth is not conceded. We express no opinion on the factual support for those claims. We can say, however, that none of these alleged Title III violations implicate any requirement that would interfere with the internal affairs and management of a vessel as our cases have employed that term.</p>\n<p>At least one subset of the petitioners' allegations, however, would appear to involve requirements that might be construed as relating to the internal affairs of foreign-flag cruise ships. These allegations concern physical barriers to access on board. For example, according to the petitioners, most of the cabins on the respondent's cruise ships, including the most attractive cabins in the most desirable locations, are not accessible to disabled passengers. Brief for Petitioners 17-18; Complaint \u00b6 16, App. 11. The petitioners also allege that the ships' coamings\u0097the raised edges around their doors\u0097make many areas of the ships inaccessible to mobility-impaired passengers who use wheelchairs or scooters. Brief for Petitioners 24. Removal of these and other access barriers, the petitioners suggest, may be required by Title III's structural barrier-removal requirement, \u00a7\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv), 12184(b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p>Although these physical barriers affect the passengers as well as the ship and its crew, the statutory requirement could mandate a permanent and significant alteration of a physical feature of the ship\u0097that is, an element of basic ship design <span class=\"star-pagination\">*135</span> and construction. If so, these applications of the barrier-removal requirement likely would interfere with the internal affairs of foreign ships. A permanent and significant modification to a ship's physical structure goes to fundamental issues of ship design and construction, and it might be impossible for a ship to comply with all the requirements different jurisdictions might impose. The clear statement rule would most likely come into play if Title III were read to require permanent and significant structural modifications to foreign vessels. It is quite a different question, however, whether Title III would require this. The Title III requirements that might impose permanent and substantial changes to a ship's architecture and design, are, like all of Title III's requirements, subject to the statute's own specific limitations and qualifications. These limitations may make resort to the clear statement rule unnecessary.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>Title III requires barrier removal if it is \"readily achievable,\" \u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv). The statute defines that term as \"easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense,\" \u00a7 12181(9). Title III does not define \"difficulty\" in \u00a7 12181(9), but use of the disjunctive\u0097\"easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense\"\u0097indicates that it extends to considerations in addition to cost. Furthermore, Title III directs that the \"readily achievable\" determination take into account \"the impact . . . upon the operation of the facility,\" \u00a7 12181(9)(B).</p>\n<p>Surely a barrier-removal requirement under Title III that would bring a vessel into non-compliance with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), Nov. 1, 1974, [1979-1980] 32 U. S. T. 47, T. I. A. S. No. 9700, or any other international legal obligation, would create serious difficulties for the vessel and would have a substantial impact <span class=\"star-pagination\">*136</span> on its operation, and thus would not be \"readily achievable.\" This understanding of the statute, urged by the United States, is eminently reasonable. Brief as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 27-28; ADA Title III Technical Assistance Manual III-1.2000(D) (Supp. 1994), available at http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/ada/taman3up.html (as visited May 31, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court's case file); 56 Fed. Reg. 45600 (1991). If, moreover, Title III's \"readily achievable\" exemption were not to take conflicts with international law into account, it would lead to the anomalous result that American cruise ships are obligated to comply with Title III even if doing so brings them into non-compliance with SOLAS, whereas foreign ships\u0097which unlike American ships have the benefit of the internal affairs clear statement rule\u0097would not be so obligated. Congress could not have intended this result.</p>\n<p>It is logical and proper to conclude, moreover, that whether a barrier modification is \"readily achievable\" under Title III must take into consideration the modification's effect on shipboard safety. A separate provision of Title III mandates that the statute's non-discrimination and accommodation requirements do not apply if disabled individuals would pose \"a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services,\" \u00a7 12182(b)(3). This reference is to a safety threat posed by a disabled individual, whereas here the question would be whether the structural modification itself may pose the safety threat. It would be incongruous, nevertheless, to attribute to Congress an intent to require modifications that threaten safety to others simply because the threat comes not from the disabled person but from the accommodation itself. The anomaly is avoided by concluding that a structural modification is not readily achievable within the meaning of \u00a7 12181(9) if it would pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*137</span> 3</h2>\n<p>Because Title III does not require structural modifications that would conflict with international legal obligations or pose any real threat to the safety of the crew or other passengers, it may well follow\u0097though we do not decide the question here\u0097that Title III does not require any permanent and significant structural modifications that interfere with the internal affairs of any cruise ship, foreign flag or domestic. If that is indeed the case, recourse to the clear statement rule would not be necessary.</p>\n<p>Cases may arise, however, where it is prudent for a court to turn first to the internal affairs clear statement rule rather than deciding the precise scope and operation of the statute. Suppose, for example, it is a difficult question whether a particular Title III barrier-removal requirement is readily achievable, but the requirement does entail a permanent and significant structural modification, interfering with a foreign ship's internal affairs. In that case a court sensibly could invoke the clear statement rule without determining whether Title III actually imposes the requirement. On the other hand, there may be many cases where it is not obvious that a particular physical modification relates to a vessel's basic architecture and construction, but it is clear the modification would conflict with SOLAS or some other international legal obligation. In those cases, a court may deem it appropriate to hold that the physical barrier modification in question is not readily achievable, without resort to the clear statement rule.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In light of the preceding analysis, it is likely that under a proper interpretation of \"readily achievable\" Title III would impose no requirements that interfere with the internal affairs of foreign-flag cruise ships. If Title III did impose a duty that required cruise ships to make permanent and significant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*138</span> structural modifications that did not conflict with international law or threaten safety, or if the statute otherwise interfered with a foreign ship's internal affairs, the clear statement rule recognized in <i>Benz</i> and <i>McCulloch</i> would come into play at that point. The Title III requirement in question, however, would still apply to domestic cruise ships, and Title III requirements having nothing to do with internal affairs would continue to apply to domestic and foreign ships alike.</p>\n<p>This application-by-application use of the internal affairs clear statement rule is consistent with how the rule has traditionally operated. In <i>Benz</i> and <i>McCulloch,</i> the Court concluded that the NLRA did not apply to labor relations between a foreign-flag ship and its foreign crew because of interference with the foreign ships' internal affairs. In <i>Ariadne Shipping,</i> however, the Court held that the NLRA does apply to labor relations between a foreign-flag ship and American longshoremen. <i>Ariadne Shipping</i> acknowledged the clear statement rule invoked in <i>Benz</i> and <i>McCulloch</i> but held that the \"considerations that informed the Court's construction of the statute in [those cases] are clearly inapplicable\" to the question whether the statute applies to foreign ships' labor relations with American longshoremen. 397 U. S., at 199. <i>Ariadne Shipping</i> held that the longshoremen's \"short-term, irregular and casual connection with the [foreign] vessels plainly belied any involvement on their part with the ships' `internal discipline and order.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 200. Therefore, application of the NLRA to foreign ships' relations with American longshoremen \"would have threatened no interference in the internal affairs of foreign-flag ships.\" <i>Ibid.</i> If the clear statement rule restricts some applications of the NLRA to foreign ships (<i>e. g.,</i> labor relations with the foreign crew), but not others (<i>e. g.,</i> labor relations with American longshoremen), it follows that the case-by-case application is also required under Title III of the ADA. The rule, where it is even necessary to invoke it, would restrict <span class=\"star-pagination\">*139</span> some applications of Title III to foreign ships (<i>e. g.,</i> certain structural barrier-modification requirements), but not others (<i>e. g.,</i> the prohibition on discriminatory ticket pricing).</p>\n<p>The internal affairs clear statement rule is an implied limitation on otherwise unambiguous general terms of the statute. It operates much like the principle that general statutes are construed not to apply extraterritorially, <i>EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co.,</i> 499 U. S. 244, 260 (1991), or the rule that general statutes are presumed not to impose monetary liability on non-consenting States, <i>Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon,</i> 473 U. S. 234 (1985). Implied limitation rules avoid applications of otherwise unambiguous statutes that would intrude on sensitive domains in a way that Congress is unlikely to have intended had it considered the matter. In these instances, the absence of a clear congressional statement is, in effect, equivalent to a statutory qualification saying, for example, \"Notwithstanding any general language of this statute, this statute shall not apply extraterritorially\"; or \". . . this statute shall not abrogate the sovereign immunity of non-consenting States\"; or \". . . this statute does not regulate the internal affairs of foreign-flag vessels.\" These clear statement rules ensure Congress does not, by broad or general language, legislate on a sensitive topic inadvertently or without due deliberation. An all-or-nothing approach, under which a statute is altogether inapplicable if but one of its specific applications trenches on the domain protected by a clear statement rule, would convert the clear statement rule from a principle of interpretive caution into a trap for an unwary Congress. If Congress passes broad legislation that has some applications that implicate a clear statement rule\u0097say, some extraterritorial applications, or some applications that would regulate foreign ships' internal affairs\u0097an all-or-nothing approach would require that the entire statute, or some arbitrary set of applications larger than the domain protected by the clear statement rule, would be nullified. We decline to adopt that posture.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*140</span> B</h2>\n<p>Our holding that the clear statement rule operates only when a ship's internal affairs are affected does not implicate our holding in <i>Clark v. Martinez,</i> 543 U. S. 371 (2005). <i>Martinez</i> held that statutory language given a limiting construction in one context must be interpreted consistently in other contexts, \"even though other of the statute's applications, standing alone, would not support the same limitation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 380. This was simply a rule of consistent interpretation of the statutory words, with no bearing on the implementation of a clear statement rule addressed to particular statutory applications.</p>\n<p>The statute in <i>Martinez,</i> 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1231(a)(6), authorized detention of aliens pending their removal. In <i>Zadvydas v. Davis,</i> 533 U. S. 678, 696-699 (2001), the Court had interpreted this statute to impose time limits on detention of aliens held for certain reasons stated in the statute. The Court held that an alternative interpretation, one allowing indefinite detention of lawfully admitted aliens, would raise grave constitutional doubts. Having determined the meaning of \u00a7 1231(a)(6)'s text in <i>Zadvydas,</i> we were obliged in <i>Martinez</i> to follow the same interpretation even in a context where the constitutional concerns were not present. <i>Martinez,</i> 543 U. S., at 377-381. As already made clear, the question was one of textual interpretation, not the scope of some implied exception. The constitutional avoidance canon simply informed the choice among plausible readings of \u00a7 1231(a)(6)'s text: \"The canon of constitutional avoidance,\" <i>Martinez</i> explained, \"comes into play only when, after the application of ordinary textual analysis, the statute is found to be susceptible of more than one construction; and the canon functions as a means of choosing between them.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 385 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p><i>Martinez</i> gives full respect to the distinction between rules for resolving textual ambiguity and implied limitations on otherwise unambiguous text. Indeed, <i>Martinez</i> relies on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*141</span> the distinction to reconcile its holding with two cases which did involve a clear statement rule, <i>Raygor v. Regents of Univ. of Minn.,</i> 534 U. S. 533 (2002), and <i>Jinks v. Richland County,</i> 538 U. S. 456 (2003). <i>Raygor</i> had held that the tolling provision in the supplemental jurisdiction statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1367(d), does not apply to non-consenting States because the statute lacks the required clear statement that States are within its coverage. Later, in <i>Jinks,</i> we held that the \u00a7 1367(d) tolling provision does apply to suits against counties. The counties were not protected by a clear statement rule analogous to the one applicable to States. See <i>Martinez,</i> 543 U. S., at 383, and n. 6; see also <i>id.,</i> at 393-394 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). \"This progression of decisions,\" we held in <i>Martinez,</i> \"does not remotely establish that \u00a7 1367(d) has two different meanings, equivalent to the unlimited-detention/limited-detention meanings of \u00a7 1231(a)(6) urged upon us here. They hold that the single and unchanging disposition of \u00a7 1367(d) . . . does not apply to claims against States that have not consented to be sued in federal court.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 383. The distinction between <i>Zadvydas</i> and <i>Martinez,</i> on the one hand, and <i>Raygor</i> and <i>Jinks,</i> on the other, is the distinction between a canon for choosing among plausible meanings of an ambiguous statute and a clear statement rule that implies a special substantive limit on the application of an otherwise unambiguous mandate.</p>\n<p>The internal affairs clear statement rule is an implied limitation rule, not a principle for resolving textual ambiguity. Our cases, then, do not compel or permit the conclusion that if any one application of Title III might interfere with a foreign-flag ship's internal affairs, Title III is inapplicable to foreign ships in every other instance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that general statutes do not apply to foreign-flag ships in United <span class=\"star-pagination\">*142</span> States waters. This Court's cases, however, stand only for the proposition that general statutes are presumed not to impose requirements that would interfere with the internal affairs of foreign-flag vessels. Except insofar as Title III regulates a vessel's internal affairs\u0097a category that is not always well defined and that may require further judicial elaboration\u0097the statute is applicable to foreign ships in United States waters to the same extent that it is applicable to American ships in those waters.</p>\n<p>Title III's own limitations and qualifications prevent the statute from imposing requirements that would conflict with international obligations or threaten shipboard safety. These limitations and qualifications, though framed in general terms, employ a conventional vocabulary for instructing courts in the interpretation and application of the statute. If, on remand, it becomes clear that even after these limitations are taken into account Title III nonetheless imposes certain requirements that would interfere with the internal affairs of foreign ships\u0097perhaps, for example, by requiring permanent and substantial structural modifications\u0097the clear statement rule would come into play. It is also open to the court on remand to consider application of the clear statement rule at the outset if, as a prudential matter, that appears to be the more appropriate course.</p>\n<p>We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court's holding that Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 covers cruise ships, <i>ante,</i> at 129, and allows them to resist modifications \"that would conflict with international legal obligations,\" <i>ante,</i> at 137 (plurality opinion). I therefore join Parts I, II-A-1, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*143</span> and II-B-2 of the Court's opinion. I would give no wider berth, however, to the \"internal affairs\" clear statement rule in determining Title III's application to respondent's cruise ships, the Norwegian Sea and Norwegian Star. But see <i>ante,</i> at 137. That rule, as I understand it, derives from, and is moored to, the broader guide that statutes \"should not be interpreted to regulate foreign persons or conduct if that regulation would conflict with principles of international law.\" <i>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California,</i> 509 U. S. 764, 815 (1993) (SCALIA, J., dissenting); see also <i>id.,</i> at 816 (describing <i>McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros de Honduras,</i> 372 U. S. 10 (1963), as applying this principle); <i>Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy,</i> 2 Cranch 64, 118 (1804). Title III is properly read to avoid such conflict, but should not be hemmed in where there is no potential for international discord.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The first of the modern cases to address the application of a domestic statute to a foreign-flag ship in U. S. waters, <i>Benz v. Compania Naviera Hidalgo, S. A.,</i> 353 U. S. 138 (1957), did not resort to the tag, \"internal affairs\" rule, to explain the Court's decision.<sup>[2]</sup><i>Benz</i> held that the Labor Management Relations Act did not reach relations between \"a foreign employer and a foreign crew operating under an agreement made abroad under the laws of another nation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 142. As we concluded in <i>Benz,</i> before reading our law to \"run interference in such a delicate field of international relations,\" \"where the possibilities of international discord are so evident and retaliative action so certain,\" the Court should await Congress' clearly expressed instruction <i>Id.,</i> at 147.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*144</span> Six years later, in <i>McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros de Honduras,</i> 372 U. S. 10 (1963), the Court relied on <i>Benz</i> to hold that the National Labor Relations Act does not regulate the representation of alien seamen recruited in Honduras to serve aboard vessels under Honduran flags. Applying our law \"to the internal management and affairs\" of the vessels in question, we observed, <i>McCulloch,</i> 372 U. S., at 20, would produce a \"head-on collision\" with the regulatory regime installed under the Honduran labor code, <i>id.,</i> at 21. \"[S]uch highly charged international circumstances,\" we said, called for adherence to the venerable interpretive guide that \"`an act of Congress ought never to be construed to violate the law of nations if any other possible construction remains.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Schooner Charming Betsy,</i> 2 Cranch, at 118). Cf. <i>Longshoremen v. Ariadne Shipping Co.,</i> 397 U. S. 195, 200 (1970) (applying U. S. law to foreign ships' labor relations with longshoreworkers employed at U. S. ports is proper because doing so \"would . . . threate[n] no interference in the internal affairs of foreign-flag ships likely to lead to conflict with foreign or international law\").</p>\n<p>The noninterference principle underlying the internal affairs clear statement rule is served in this case by the Court's interpretation of Title III's \"readily achievable\" provision, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv). See <i>ante,</i> at 135-136. Construing this language to allow ships to resist modifications \"that would conflict with international legal obligations,\" <i>ante,</i> at 137, the plurality ensures that Title III will not provoke \"international discord\" of the kind <i>Benz</i> and <i>McCulloch</i> sought to avoid. I agree with this interpretation, but would create no larger space for the internal affairs rule.</p>\n<p>The plurality, however, suggests that the clear statement rule has a further office: It may block structural modifications prompted by Title III that are \"readily achievable\"\u0097because they do not conflict with international legal obligations\u0097but nonetheless \"interfer[e] with a foreign ship's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*145</span> internal affairs.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 137. I disagree with this conception of the rule. In positing an extended application of the internal affairs rule, the plurality cuts the rule loose from its foundation. As <i>Benz</i> and <i>McCulloch</i> demonstrate, the clear statement rule is an interpretive principle counseling against construction of a statute in a manner productive of international discord. When international relations are not at risk, and there is good reason to apply our own law, asserted internal affairs of a ship should hold no greater sway than asserted management prerogatives of a landlocked enterprise.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>As the plurality rightly notes, Title III is a broad remedial statute designed to protect persons with disabilities in a variety of activities and settings. See <i>ante,</i> at 132; \u00a7 12101(b). The United States has a strong interest in ensuring that U. S. resident cruise passengers enjoy Title III's protections on both domestic and foreign ships. See \u00a7 12101; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 10.<sup>[4]</sup> Once conflicts with international legal obligations are avoided, I see no reason to demand a clearer congressional statement that Title III reaches the vessels in question, ships that regularly sail to and from U. S. ports and derive most of their income from U. S. passengers. In sum, I agree that \u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv), properly read, does not require shipowners to make modifications that would conflict with international legal obligations. But I would attribute to the internal affairs clear statement rule no further limitation on Title III's governance in this case.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*146</span> JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in part, dissenting in part, and concurring in the judgment in part.</p>\n<p>When a law regulates the internal order of ships, Congress must clearly express its intent to apply the law to foreign-flag ships. <i>Ante,</i> at 130-132 (plurality opinion); <i>post,</i> at 149-150 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). I agree with JUSTICE SCALIA that this rule applies to any structural changes to a ship that Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) might require, for such changes to a ship's physical structure pertain to its internal affairs. <i>Post,</i> at 151 (dissenting opinion); see <i>ante,</i> at 134-135 (plurality opinion). I further agree with JUSTICE SCALIA that this clear statement rule applies once the possibility, rather than the certainty, of international discord arises; and that the clear statement rule therefore does not require or permit the kind of express conflicts-of-law analysis that the plurality demands. <i>Post,</i> at 153-155 (dissenting opinion); <i>ante,</i> at 135-137 (majority opinion). Moreover, I do not think that courts should (as the plurality permits) employ the rule selectively, applying it when \"prudent\" but declining to apply it when \"appropriate.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 137 (plurality opinion); see also <i>post,</i> at 158, n. 8 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); <i>Small v. United States,</i> 544 U. S. 385, 405 (2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (\"Whatever the utility of canons as guides to congressional intent, they are useless when modified in ways that Congress could never have imagined\"). For those reasons, I join Part I-A of JUSTICE SCALIA'S dissent. While I conclude that the rule applies to certain aspects of Title III, I agree with the plurality that it does not require an \"all-or-nothing approach.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 139. Consequently, those applications of Title III that do not pertain to internal affairs apply to foreign-flag vessels. For that reason, I join Part III-A of the plurality opinion.</p>\n<p>I reach this result, however, only because I continue to reject the \"lowest common denominator\" principle the Court articulated for the first time in <i>Clark v. Martinez,</i> 543 U. S. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*147</span> 371 (2005). See <i>id.,</i> at 395-397 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). The plurality, by contrast, accepts <i>Clark.</i> Moreover, it claims that applying Title III of the ADA to matters that are not within the realm of a ship's internal order is consistent with <i>Clark.</i> The plurality's efforts to distinguish <i>Clark</i> are implausible.</p>\n<p>The plurality says that today's case differs from <i>Clark</i> because it invokes a clear statement rule to interpret unambiguous text. According to the plurality, <i>Clark</i> concerned the application of a previously adopted limiting construction of ambiguous text, which this Court imposed to ameliorate unrelated constitutional doubts. <i>Ante,</i> at 140-141. As an initial matter, however, the statute at issue in <i>Zadvydas v. Davis,</i> 533 U. S. 678 (2001), and <i>Clark</i> was not ambiguous. <i>Clark, supra,</i> at 402-403 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Even assuming for the sake of argument that it was ambiguous, the distinction the plurality draws has no basis in <i>Clark.</i> In <i>Clark,</i> this Court addressed the period of detention 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1231(a)(6) authorized for inadmissible aliens. This was a question left open by <i>Zadvydas, supra,</i> which had addressed the period of detention under the same statute but with respect to a different class of aliens\u0097those who had been admitted into the country. In <i>Zadvydas,</i> this Court had concluded that the possibility of indefinite detention of admitted aliens raised significant constitutional doubts and, in light of those doubts, it limited the Attorney General's power to detain admitted aliens. 533 U. S., at 689-690, 699. Section 1231(a)(6) does not distinguish between the two classes of aliens. Thus, this Court in <i>Clark</i> concluded it was compelled to apply that same construction, which was warranted only by the specific constitutional concerns arising for admitted aliens, to the unadmitted aliens before it. 543 U. S., at 378. <i>Clark</i>'s conclusion stemmed from the narrowing construction adopted in <i>Zadvydas,</i> not the type of rule or canon that gave rise to that construction. 543 U. S., at 377-378.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*148</span> The plurality's reasoning cannot be squared with <i>Clark</i>'s \"lowest common denominator\" principle. Under <i>Clark,</i> \"[t]he lowest common denominator, as it were, must govern.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 380. Just as in <i>Zadvydas</i> and <i>Clark,</i> this Court is called upon to interpret the same statutory text with respect to two different classes of cases\u0097those that implicate the internal affairs of a vessel and those that do not. And just like the statute at issue in <i>Zadvydas</i> and <i>Clark,</i> Title III \"applies without differentiation\" to the internal and external affairs of foreign-flag vessels, as well as the internal and external affairs of domestic-flag ships. 543 U. S., at 378. Thus, the limiting construction of Title III's definitions excluding foreign cruise ships from those definitions must govern <i>all</i> applications of the statute, not just those applications that pertain to internal affairs. According to <i>Clark,</i> the Court may not narrow Title III on a case-by-case basis, depending on whether a particular application of Title III interferes with a ship's internal order. In fact, it may not apply Title III to any ship or, for that matter, any entity at all, because Title III does not distinguish between any of the covered entities. This demonstrates why the principle <i>Clark</i> established is flawed.</p>\n<p>Today's decision, then, cabins the <i>Clark</i> principle to apply only when the canon of constitutional avoidance is invoked to choose among ambiguous readings of a statute. But even here <i>Clark</i> will continue to make mischief. As I explained in <i>Clark,</i> the lowest common denominator principle requires courts to search out a single hypothetical constitutionally doubtful case to limit a statute's terms in the wholly different case actually before the court, lest the court fail to adopt a reading of the statute that reflects the lowest common denominator. <i>Id.,</i> at 400 (dissenting opinion). This requires a reverse-<i>Salerno</i> analysis that upends our facial challenge requirements. See <i>Clark, supra,</i> at 381-382; see also <i>United States v. Salerno,</i> 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987) (for a facial challenge to succeed, there must be no circumstance in which <span class=\"star-pagination\">*149</span> the statute is constitutional). For this and other reasons I have explained, the <i>Clark</i> analysis allows much havoc to be wrought from the canon of constitutional avoidance. See <i>Clark, supra,</i> at 395-401 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p>In sum, I believe that Title III of the ADA, insofar as it requires structural changes, lacks a sufficiently clear statement that it applies to the internal affairs of foreign vessels. In my view the clear statement rule does not render Title III entirely inapplicable to foreign vessels; instead, Title III applies to foreign ships only to the extent to which it does not bear on their internal affairs. I therefore would remand for consideration of those Title III claims that do not pertain to the structure of the ship. Accordingly, I concur in Part III-A of the plurality opinion, join Part I-A of JUSTICE SCALIA's dissent, and concur in the judgment in part.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE O'CONNOR join, and with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins as to Part I-A, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent. The plurality correctly recognizes that Congress must clearly express its intent to apply its laws to foreign-flag ships when those laws interfere with the ship's internal order. Its attempt to place Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) outside this rule through creative statutory interpretation and piecemeal application of its provisions is unsupported by our case law. Title III plainly affects the internal order of foreign-flag cruise ships, subjecting them to the possibility of conflicting international obligations. I would hold that, since there is no clear statement of coverage, Title III does not apply to foreign-flag cruise ships.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>As the plurality explains, where a law would interfere with the regulation of a ship's internal order, we require a clear statement that Congress intended such a result. See <span class=\"star-pagination\">*150</span> <i>ante,</i> at 129. This rule is predicated on the \"rule of international law that the law of the flag state ordinarily governs the internal affairs of a ship,\" <i>McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros de Honduras,</i> 372 U. S. 10, 21 (1963), and is designed to avoid \"the possibilit[y] of international discord,\" <i>Benz v. Compania Naviera Hidalgo, S. A.,</i> 353 U. S. 138, 147 (1957); see also <i>McCulloch, supra,</i> at 19.</p>\n<p>The clear-statement rule finds support not only in <i>Benz</i> and <i>McCulloch,</i> but in cases like <i>Cunard S. S. Co. v. Mellon,</i> 262 U. S. 100, 128-129 (1923), where we held that the National Prohibition Act, 41 Stat. 305, forbade foreign-flag ships from carrying or serving alcohol in United States territorial waters. Though we did not say so expressly in that case, prohibiting the carrying and serving of alcohol in United States waters cannot be said to affect the \"internal order\" of the ship, because it does not in any way affect the operation or functioning of the craft.<sup>[1]</sup> Similarly, in <i>Lauritzen v. Larsen,</i> 345 U. S. 571 (1953), and <i>Hellenic Lines Ltd. v. Rhoditis,</i> 398 U. S. 306 (1970), we did <i>not</i> employ a clear-statement rule in determining whether foreign seamen injured aboard foreign-flag ships could recover under the Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U. S. C. App. \u00a7 688. We distinguished these cases in <i>McCulloch,</i> explaining that a clear statement is not required \"in different contexts, such as the Jones Act . . . where <i>the pervasive regulation of the internal order of a ship may not be present.\"</i> 372 U. S., at 19, n. 9 (emphasis added).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*151</span> As the plurality concedes, <i>ante,</i> at 134, the structura modifications that Title III of the ADA requires under its barrier-removal provisions, see 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 12182(b)(2) (A)(iv), 12184(b)(2)(C), would plainly affect the ship's \"internal order.\" Rendering exterior cabins handicapped accessible, changing the levels of coamings, and adding public restrooms \u0097 the types of modifications petitioners request \u0097 would require alteration of core physical aspects of the ship, some of which relate to safety. (Safety has, under international law, traditionally been the province of a ship's flag state.) This is quite different from prohibiting alcohol in United States waters or imposing tort liability for injuries sustained on foreign ships in port \u0097 the laws at issue in <i>Cunard</i> and the Jones Act cases. Those restrictions affected the ship only in limited circumstances, and in ways ancillary to its operation at sea. A ship's design and construction, by contrast, are at least as integral to the ship's operation and functioning as the bargaining relationship between shipowner and crew at issue in <i>Benz</i> and <i>McCulloch.</i></p>\n<p>Moreover, the structural changes petitioners request would be permanent. Whereas a ship precluded from serving or carrying alcohol in United States waters may certainly carry and serve alcohol on its next trip from Italy to Greece, structural modifications made to comply with American laws cannot readily be removed once the ship leaves our waters and ceases to carry American passengers. This is again much like the situation presented in <i>Benz</i> and <i>McCulloch,</i> where the application of American labor laws would have continued to govern contracts between foreign shipowners and their foreign crews well beyond their time in our waters.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the \"internal order\" clear-statement requirement is to avoid casually subjecting oceangoing vessels to laws that pose obvious risks of conflict with the laws of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*152</span> ship's flag state, the laws of other nations, and international obligations to which the vessels are subject. That structural modifications required under Title III qualify as matters of \"internal order\" is confirmed by the fact that they may already conflict with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), Nov. 1, 1974, [1979-1980] 32 U. S. T. 47, T. I. A. S. No. 9700. That treaty, which establishes the safety standards governing the design and maintenance of oceangoing ships, has been ratified by 155 countries. See International Maritime Organization, Summary of Status of Conventions, http://www.imo.org/Conventions/mainframe.asp?topic_id=247 (all Internet materials as visited June 2, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). The ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) Review Advisory Committee \u0097 the Government body Congress has charged with formulating the Title III barrier-removal guidelines \u0097 has promulgated rules requiring at least one accessible means of egress to be an elevator, whereas SOLAS, which requires at least two means of escape, does not allow elevators to be one of them. See Passenger Vessel Access Advisory Committee, Final Report: Recommendations for Accessibility Guidelines for Passenger Vehicles, ch. 13, pt. I (Dec. 2000), http://www.access-board.gov/news/pvaac-rept.htm (hereinafter PVAAC Report) (explaining potential conflicts between ADAAG regulations and SOLAS). The ADAAG rules set coaming heights for doors required to be accessible at one-half inch; SOLAS sets coaming heights for some exterior doors at three to six inches to ensure that those doors will be watertight. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Similar inconsistencies may exist between Title III's structural requirements and the disability laws of other countries. The United Kingdom, for example, is considering the promulgation of rules to govern handicapped accessibility to passenger vehicles, including cruise ships. The rules being considered currently include exact specifications, down to the centimeter, for the height of handrails, beds, and electrical <span class=\"star-pagination\">*153</span> switches, and the width of door openings. See Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, The design of large passenger ships and passenger infrastructure: Guidance on meeting the needs of disabled people (Nov. 2000), http://www.dptac.gov.uk/pubs/guideship/pdf/dptacbroch.pdf. Though many of these regulations may be compatible with Title III, it is easy to imagine conflicts arising, given the detailed nature of ADAAG's regulations. See PVAAC Report, chs. 1-11. As we have previously noted, even this \"<i>possibility</i> of international discord\" with regard to a seagoing vessel's internal order, <i>McCulloch,</i> 372 U. S., at 21 (emphasis added), gives rise to the presumption of noncoverage absent clear statement to the contrary.</p>\n<p>The Court asserts that Title III would not produce conflicts with the requirements of SOLAS and would not compromise safety concerns. This argument comes at the expense of an expansive <i>en passant</i> interpretation of the exceptions to the barrier-removal requirements of Title III \u0097 which interpretation will likely have more significant nationwide effects than the Court's holding concerning Title III's application to foreign-flag vessels. Assuming, however, that the argument is even correct,<sup>[3]</sup> it is entirely beside the point. It has never been a condition for application of the foreign-flag clear-statement rule that an actual conflict with foreign or international law be established \u0097 any more than that has been a condition for application of the clear-statement rule regarding extraterritorial effect of congressional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*154</span> enactments. The reason to apply the rule here is that the structure of a ship pertains to the ship's internal order, which is a matter presumably left to the flag state unless Congress indicates otherwise. The basis for that presumption of congressional intent is principally (though perhaps not exclusively) that subjecting such matters to the commands of various jurisdictions raises the <i>possibility</i> (not necessarily the certainty) of conflict among jurisdictions and with international treaties. Even if the Court could, by an imaginative interpretation of Title III, demonstrate that in this particular instance there would be no conflict with the laws of other nations or with international treaties,<sup>[4]</sup> it would remain true that a ship's structure is preeminently part of its internal order; and it would remain true that subjecting ship structure to multiple national requirements invites conflict. <i>That</i> is what triggers application of the clear-statement rule.</p>\n<p>Safety concerns \u0097 and specifically safety as related to ship structure \u0097 are traditionally the responsibility of the flag state. Which is to say they are regarded as part of the ship's internal order. And even if Title III makes ample provision for a safety exception to the barrier-removal requirements, what <i>it</i> considers necessary for safety is not necessarily what other nations or international treaties consider necessary.</p>\n<p>The foregoing renders quite unnecessary the Court's worry that Title III might require American cruise ships to adhere to Congress's prescription in violation of SOLAS. See <i>ante,</i> at 135-136. If and when that possibility presents itself, the Court remains free to do what it does here: to interpret Title III so as to avoid any conflict. But the availability <span class=\"star-pagination\">*155</span> of such an interpretation has no bearing upon whether the structural features of an oceangoing vessel are part of its internal order. (I must observe, however, that it seems much more plausible that Congress intended to require American cruise ships to adhere to Title III regardless of SOLAS, than that \u0097 what the Court apparently believes \u0097 Congress intended Title III to be interpreted with an eye to SOLAS.) In any event, the application of Title III to oceangoing vessels under American flag is not at issue here. I would therefore hold that, because Title III's barrier-removal provisions clearly have the possibility of subjecting foreign-flag ships to conflicting international obligations, no reading of Title III \u0097 no matter how creative \u0097 can alter the presumption that Title III does not apply to foreign-flag ships without a clear statement from Congress.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The plurality holds that, even \"[i]f Title III did impose a duty that required [foreign-flag] cruise ships to make permanent and significant structural modifications[,] or ... otherwise interfered with a foreign ship's internal affairs, ... Title III requirements having nothing to do with internal affairs would continue to apply to domestic and foreign ships alike.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 137-138. I disagree. Whether or not Title III's prescriptions regarding such matters implicate the \"internal order\" of the ship, they still relate to the ships' maritime operations and are part of the same Title III.<sup>[6]</sup> The requirements of that enactment either apply to foreign-flag ships or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*156</span> they do not. It is not within our power to design a statute some of whose provisions apply to foreign-flag ships and other of whose provisions do not \u0097 any more than it is within our power to prescribe that the statute applies to foreign-flag cruise ships 60% of whose passengers are United States citizens and does not apply to other foreign-flag cruise ships.</p>\n<p>The plurality's assertion that those portions of Title III that do <i>not</i> implicate a ship's internal order apply to foreign-flag ships displays a confusion between a principle of interpretation based upon a true-to-fact presumption of congressional intent, and a court-made rule. The plurality seems to forget that it is a matter of determining whether Congress <i>in fact intended</i> that its enactment cover foreign-flag ships. To believe that there was any such intent section-by-section and paragraph-by-paragraph is delusional. Either Congress enacted Title III only with domestic entities (and not foreign-flag ships) in mind, or it intended Title III to apply across-the-board. It could not possibly be the real congressional intent that foreign-flag cruise ships be considered \"place[s] of public accommodation\" or \"specified public transportation\" for purposes of certain provisions but not for others. That Congress had separate foreign-flag intent with respect to each requirement \u0097 and would presumably adopt a clear statement provision-by-provision \u0097 is utterly implausible. And far from its being the case that this creates \"a trap for an unwary Congress,\" <i>ante,</i> at 139, it is the plurality's disposition that, in piecemeal fashion, applies to foreign-flag ships provisions never enacted with foreign-flag vessels in mind.<sup>[7]</sup> We recently addressed a similar question <span class=\"star-pagination\">*157</span> in <i>Clark</i> v. <i>Martinez,</i> 543 U. S. 371 (2005), where we explained that a statutory provision must be interpreted consistently from case to case. \"It is not at all unusual to give a statut[e] . . . a limiting construction called for by one of the statute's applications, even though other of the statute's applications, standing alone, would not support the same limitation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 380. That principle should apply here. Since some applications of Title III plainly affect the internal order of foreign-flag ships, the absence of a clear statement renders the statute inapplicable \u0097 even though some applications of the statute, if severed from the rest, would not require clear statement.</p>\n<p>This does not mean that a clear statement is required whenever a court applies Title III to any entity \u0097 only that a clear statement is required to apply any part of Title III <i>to foreign-flag ships. </i><i>Raygor</i> v. <i>Regents of Univ. of Minn.,</i> 534 U. S. 533 (2002), and <i>Jinks</i> v. <i>Richland County,</i> 538 U. S. 456 (2003), do not dictate otherwise. <i>Raygor</i> held that 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1367(d) does not include, in its tolling of the limitations period, claims against States, because it contains no clear statement that States are covered. <i>Jinks</i> held that \u00a7 1367(d)'s tolling provision does apply to claims against political subdivisions of States, because no clear-statement requirement applies to those entities. In other words, a clear statement is required to apply \u00a7 1367(d) to States, just as a clear statement is required to apply Title III to foreign-flag ships. A clear statement is <i>not</i> required to apply \u00a7 1367(d) to political subdivisions of States, just as a clear statement is <i>not</i> required to apply Title III to domestic ships or other domestic entities. The question in each of these cases is whether <i>the statute</i> at issue covers certain entities, not whether some <i>provisions</i> of a statute cover a given entity.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*158</span> The fine tuning of legislation that the plurality requires would be better left to Congress. To attempt it through the process of case-by-case adjudication is a recipe for endless litigation and confusion. The plurality's resolution of today's case proves the point. It requires this Title III claimant (and every other one who brings a claim against a foreign shipowner) to show that each particular remedy he seeks does not implicate the internal order of the ship. That showing, where structural modification is involved, would not only require the district court to determine what is \"readily achievable,\" <i>ante,</i> at 135-136 (majority opinion), and what would \"pose `a significant risk to the health or safety of others,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 136 (majority opinion) (quoting \u00a7 12182(b)(3)), but would also require it to determine the obligations imposed by foreign law and international treaties.<sup>[8]</sup> All this to establish the preliminary point that Title III applies and the claim can proceed to adjudication. If Congress desires to impose this time-consuming and intricate process, it is certainly able to do so \u0097 though I think it would likely prefer some more manageable solution.<sup>[9]</sup> But for the plurality <span class=\"star-pagination\">*159</span> to impose it as a novel consequence of the venerable clear-statement rule seems to me unreasonable. I would therefore decline to apply all of Title III to foreign-flag ships without a clear statement from Congress.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>As the Court appears to concede, neither the \"public accommodation\" provision nor the \"specified public transportation\" provision of Title III clearly covers foreign-flag cruise ships. The former prohibits discrimination \"on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.\" 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 12182(a). Though Congress gave a seemingly exhaustive list of entities constituting \"public accommodation[s]\" \u0097 including inns, hotels, restaurants, theaters, banks, zoos, and laundromats \u0097 it failed to mention ships, much less foreign-flag ships. See \u00a7 12181(7). Particularly where Congress has provided such detailed specification, this is not a clear statement that foreign-flag ships are covered. Petitioners also claim that, because cruise ships are essentially floating hotels that contain restaurants and other facilities explicitly named in \u00a7 12181(7), they should be covered. While this may support the argument that <i>cruise ships</i> are \"public accommodations,\" it does not support the position that Congress intended to reach <i>foreign-flag</i> cruise ships.</p>\n<p>The \"specified public transportation\" provision prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability \"in the full and equal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*160</span> enjoyment of specified public transportation services provided by a private entity that is primarily engaged in the business of transporting people and whose operations affect commerce.\" \u00a7 12184(a). The definition of \"specified public transportation\" includes \"transportation by bus, rail, or any other conveyance (other than by aircraft) that provides the general public with general or special service (including charter service) on a regular and continuing basis.\" \u00a7 12181(10). \"[A]ny other conveyance\" clearly covers ships. But even if the statute specifically <i>mentioned</i> ships, that would not be a clear statement that <i>foreign-flag</i> ships are included \u0097 any more than the reference to \"employer\" in the NLRA constituted a clear statement that foreign-flag ship employers were covered, see <i>McCulloch,</i> 372 U. S., at 19-21.</p>\n<p>Title III of the ADA stands in contrast to other statutes in which Congress <i>has</i> made clear its intent to extend its laws to foreign ships. For example, the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, 94 Stat. 1159, 46 U. S. C. App. \u00a7 1901 <i>et seq.,</i> which permits the inspection and apprehension of vessels suspected of possessing controlled substances, applies to \"vessel[s] subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,\" \u00a7 1903(a), which includes vessels \"located within the customs waters of the United States,\" \u00a7 1903(c)(1)(D), and \"vessel[s] registered in a foreign nation where the flag nation has consented or waived objection\" to United States jurisdiction, \u00a7 1903(c)(1)(C). Section 5 of the Johnson Act, 64 Stat. 1135, as amended, 106 Stat. 61, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 1175(a), restricts the use of gambling devices \"on a vessel . . . documented under the laws of a foreign country.\" See also 14 U. S. C. \u00a7 89(a) (Coast Guard may engage in searches on \"waters over which the United States has jurisdiction\" of \"any vessel subject to the jurisdiction, or to the operation of any law, of the United States\"); 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 2274 (making it unlawful for \"the owner, master or person in charge or command of any private vessel, foreign or domestic . . . within the territorial waters of the United States\" willfully to cause or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*161</span> permit the destruction or injury of their vessel in certain circumstances).</p>\n<p>That the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation \u0097 the Executive agencies charged with enforcing the ADA \u0097 appear to have concluded that Congress intended Title III to apply to foreign-flag cruise ships does not change my view. We \"accept only those agency interpretations that are reasonable in light of the principles of construction courts normally employ.\" <i>ARAMCO,</i> 499 U. S. 244, 260 (1991) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (declining to adopt the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's determination that Title VII applied to employers abroad); see also <i>id.,</i> at 257-258 (opinion of the Court) (same). In light of our longstanding clear-statement rule, it is not reasonable to apply Title III here.</p>\n<p>I would therefore affirm the Fifth Circuit's judgment that Title III of the ADA does not apply to foreign-flag cruise ships in United States territorial waters.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   Briefs of <i>amid curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for the State of Texas et al. by <i>Greg Abbott,</i> Attorney General of Texas, <i>Barry R.

Conrad;</i> and for the International Council of Cruise Lines by <i>Lawrence W. Kaye</i> and <i>William J. Tucker.</i></p>\n<p><i>Samuel Conte</i> filed a brief for the Mediterranean Shipping Company Crociere, S. p. A., as <i>amicus curiae.</i></p>\n<p>[1]  Were a clear statement rule in order, I would agree with the phurality's application-by-application approach.</p>\n<p>[2]  0nly in a footnote describing a National Labor Relations Board decision did the Court make a synonymous reference to the \"internal economy of a vessel of foreign registry and ownership.\" <i>Benz,</i> 353 U. S., at 143, n. 5.</p>\n<p>[3]  One could hardly anticipate that, absent conflict with international legal obligations, the application of Title III sought in this case would generate a \"storm of diplomatic protest.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 146 (noting \"scorm of diplomatic protest\" against proposal to apply U. S. law to prohibit advance payments by a foreign vessel to foreign seamen in foreign ports).</p>\n<p>[4]  As the Court notes, the ships at issue here \"are operated by a company based in the United States, serve predominantly United States residents, and are in most other respects United States-centered ventures.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 126. Merchant ships sailing between U. S. and foreign ports would present a different question.</p>\n<p>[1]  The plurality also appears to have found that the National Prohibition Act contained a clear statement of intent to reach foreign-flag vessels, because the Act had been amended to state that it applied to \"all territory subject to [the] jurisdiction\" of the United States. <i>Cunard S. S. Co. v. Mellon,</i> 262 U. S. 100, 127 (1923) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>[2]  The plurality intimates that the clear-statement rule might be inapplicable in situations where, as here, the foreign-flag ships have a number of contacts with the United States. See <i>ante,</i> at 131-132. <i>McCulloch,</i> 372 U. S., at 19, expressly rejected this approach, explaining that any attempt to weigh the ship's contacts with the United States \"would inevitably lead to embarrassment in foreign affairs and [would] be entirely infeasible in actual practice.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  This is by no means clear. Title III defines \"readily achievable\" as \"easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense.\" 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 12181(9). It is, at best, ambiguous whether a barrier removal can be rendered not \"easily <i>accomplishable</i>\" or not \"able to be <i>carried out</i> without much difficulty\" by factors extrinsic to the removal itself. Conflict of an easily altered structure with foreign laws seems to me not much different from the tendency of an easily altered structure to deter customers. That is why, as suggested in text, the Court's unexpected Title III holding may be the most significant aspect of today's foreign-flag decision.</p>\n<p>[4]  The Court, of course, has not even shown that Title III is consistent with the laws of the cruise ships' flag state; much less has it undertaken the Herculean task \u0097 which its theory of presumed coverage by domestic law would require \u0097 of showing Title III consistent with the laws of all the cruise ships' ports of call.</p>\n<p>[5]  Of course this clear-statement rule would not apply to the onshore operations of foreign cruise companies, which would be treated no differently from the operations of other foreign companies on American soil.</p>\n<p>[6]  This includes the pricing and ticketing policies, which are intimately related to the ships' maritime operations (and perhaps to internal order) because they are designed to defray the added cost and provide the added protection that the cruise-ship companies deem necessary for safe transport of disabled passengers.</p>\n<p>[7]  The plurality's discussion of <i>Longshoremen</i> v. <i>Ariadne Shipping Co.,</i> 397 U. S. 195 (1970), is misleading. Although <i>Ariadne</i> clearly recognized the existence of an internal-order rule in our case law, see <i>id.,</i> at 200, <i>Ariadne</i> did not hold, similarly to what the plurality holds here, that application of the foreign-flag clear-statement rule prevented some provisions of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) from being applied to foreign-flag ships but allowed others to be applied. Rather, it held that the clear-statement rule <i>did not apply at all</i> to activities that were not \"within the `maritime operations of foreign-flag ships.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> The case is relevant only to questions the Court does not decide here \u0097 namely, application of Title III to onshore operations of the foreign-flag ships. It is <i>not</i> relevant to the question whether <i>all</i> maritime activities are exempt from Title III for lack of a clear statement.</p>\n<p>[8]  The plurality attempts to simplify this inquiry by explaining that, if it is \"a difficult question whether a particular Title III barrier-removal requirement is readily achievable, but the requirement does entail a permanent and significant structural modification, interfering with a foreign ship's internal affairs[,] a court sensibly could invoke the clear statement rule without determining whether Title III actually imposes the requirement.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 137. It is impossible to reconcile this with the plurality's rationale, which excludes the clear-statement rule when there is no actual conflict with foreign law. On the plurality's own analysis, significant structural modifications are <i>least likely</i> to pose an actual conflict with foreign law, since they are <i>most likely</i> to be regarded as (under the plurality's new Title III jurisprudence) not \"readily achievable\" and hence not required. I am at a loss to understand what the plurality has in mind.</p>\n<p>[9]  After this Court concluded, in <i>EEOC</i> v. <i>Arabian American Oil Co.,</i> 499 U. S. 244, 260 (1991) <i>(ARAMCO),</i> that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not protect American citizens working for American employers in foreign countries, Congress amended Title VII. Unlike what would have been this Court's only available resolution of the issue had it come to the opposite conclusion in <i>ARAMCO</i> \u0097 that Title VII applies to all American employers operating abroad \u0097 Congress was able to craft a more nuanced solution by exempting employers if compliance with Title VII would run afoul of the law in the country where the workplace was located. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-1(b); cf. \u00a7 12112(c)(1) (same disposition for Title I of the ADA).</p>\n\n</div>",
