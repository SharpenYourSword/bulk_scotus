J., and O'CONNOR, SCALIA, KENNEDY, SOUTER, GINSBURG, and BREYER, JJ., joined. BREYER, J., filed a concurring opinion, <i>post,</i> p. 173. THOMAS, J., filed a dissenting opinion, <i>post,</i> p. 173.</p>\n<p><i>Stephen B. Bedrick,</i> by appointment of the Court, 543 U. S. 1143, argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs was <i>Eric Schnapper.</i></p>\n<p><i>Seth K. Schalit,</i> Supervising Deputy Attorney General of California, argued the cause for respondent.

Sullivan,</i> Supervising Deputy Attorney General.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of California and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit have provided conflicting answers to the following question: \"Whether to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case under <i>Batson</i> v. <i>Kentucky,</i> 476 U. S. 79 (1986), the objector must show that it is more likely than not that the other party's peremptory challenges, if unexplained, were based on impermissible group bias?\" Pet. for Cert. i. Because both of those courts regularly review the validity of convictions obtained in California criminal trials, respondent, the State of California, agreed to petitioner's request that we grant certiorari and resolve the conflict. We agree with the Ninth Circuit that the question presented must be answered in the negative, and accordingly reverse the judgment of the California Supreme Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Jay Shawn Johnson, a black male, was convicted in a California trial court of second-degree murder and assault on a white 19-month-old child, resulting in death. During jury selection, a number of prospective jurors were removed for cause until 43 eligible jurors remained, 3 of whom were black. The prosecutor used 3 of his 12 peremptory challenges to remove the black prospective jurors. The resulting jury, including alternates, was all white.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*165</span> After the prosecutor exercised the second of his three peremptory challenges against the prospective black jurors, defense counsel objected on the ground that the challenge was unconstitutionally based on race under both the California and United States Constitutions. <i>People</i> v. <i>Johnson,</i> 30 Cal. 4th 1302, 1307, 71 P. 3d 270, 272-273 (2003).<sup>[1]</sup> Defense counsel alleged that the prosecutor \"had no apparent reason to challenge this prospective juror `other than [her] racial identity.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (alteration in original). The trial judge did not ask the prosecutor to explain the rationale for his strikes. Instead, the judge simply found that petitioner had failed to establish a prima facie case under the governing state precedent, <i>People</i> v. <i>Wheeler,</i> 22 Cal. 3d 258, 583 P. 2d 748 (1978), reasoning \"`that there's not been shown a <i>strong likelihood</i> that the exercise of the peremptory challenges were based upon a group rather than an individual basis,'\" 30 Cal. 4th, at 1307, 71 P. 3d, at 272 (emphasis added). The judge did, however, warn the prosecutor that \"`we are very close.'\" <i>People</i> v. <i>Johnson,</i> 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 727, 729 (Ct. App. 2001).</p>\n<p>Defense counsel made an additional motion the next day when the prosecutor struck the final remaining prospective black juror. 30 Cal. 4th, at 1307, 71 P. 3d, at 272. Counsel argued that the prosecutor's decision to challenge all of the prospective black jurors constituted a \"systematic attempt to exclude African-Americans from the jury panel.\" 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 729. The trial judge still did not seek an explanation from the prosecutor. Instead, she explained that her own examination of the record had convinced her that the prosecutor's strikes could be justified by race-neutral reasons. Specifically, the judge opined that the black venire members had offered equivocal or confused answers in their written questionnaires. 30 Cal. 4th, at 1307-1308, 71 P. 3d, at 272-273. Despite the fact that \"`the Court would not grant the challenges for cause, there were answers <span class=\"star-pagination\">*166</span> . . . at least on the questionnaires themselves [such] that the Court felt that there was sufficient basis'\" for the strikes. <i>Id.,</i> at 1308, 71 P. 3d, at 273 (brackets added). Therefore, even considering that all of the prospective black jurors had been stricken from the pool, the judge determined that petitioner had failed to establish a prima facie case.</p>\n<p>The California Court of Appeal set aside the conviction. <i>People</i> v. <i>Johnson,</i> 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 727 (2001). Over the dissent of one judge, the majority ruled that the trial judge had erred by requiring petitioner to establish a \"strong likelihood\" that the peremptory strikes had been impermissibly based on race. Instead, the trial judge should have only required petitioner to proffer enough evidence to support an \"inference\" of discrimination.<sup>[2]</sup> The Court of Appeal's holding relied on decisions of this Court, prior California case law, and the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in <i>Wade</i> v. <i>Terhune,</i> 202 F. 3d 1190 (2000). Applying the proper \"reasonable inference\" standard, the majority concluded that petitioner had produced sufficient evidence to support a prima facie case.</p>\n<p>Respondent appealed, and the California Supreme Court reinstated petitioner's conviction over the dissent of two justices. The court stressed that <i>Batson</i> v. <i>Kentucky,</i> 476 U. S. 79 (1986), left to state courts the task of establishing the standards used to evaluate the sufficiency of defendants' prima facie cases. 30 Cal. 4th, at 1314, 71 P. 3d, at 277. The court then reviewed <i>Batson, Wheeler,</i> and those decisions' progeny, and concluded that \"<i>Wheeler</i>'s terms `strong likelihood' and `reasonable inference' state the same standard\" \u0097 one that is entirely consistent with <i>Batson.</i> 30 Cal. 4th, at 1313, 71 P. 3d, at 277. A prima facie case under <i>Batson</i> establishes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*167</span> a \"`legally mandatory, rebuttable presumption,'\" it does not merely constitute \"enough evidence to <i>permit the inference</i>\" that discrimination has occurred. 30 Cal. 4th, at 1315, 71 P. 3d, at 278. <i>Batson,</i> the court held, \"permits a court to require the objector to present, not merely `some evidence' permitting the inference, but `strong evidence' that makes discriminatory intent <i>more likely than not</i> if the challenges are not explained.\" 30 Cal. 4th, at 1316, 71 P. 3d, at 278. The court opined that while this burden is \"not onerous,\" it remains \"substantial.\" <i>Ibid.,</i> 71 P. 3d, at 279.</p>\n<p>Applying that standard, the court acknowledged that the case involved the \"highly relevant\" circumstance that a black defendant was \"charged with killing `his White girlfriend's child,'\" and that \"it certainly looks suspicious that all three African-American prospective jurors were removed from the jury.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1326, 71 P. 3d, at 286. Yet petitioner's <i>Batson</i> showing, the court held, consisted \"primarily of the statistical disparity of peremptory challenges between African-Americans and others.\" 30 Cal. 4th, at 1327, 71 P. 3d, at 287. Although those statistics were indeed \"troubling and, as the trial court stated, the question was close,\" <i>id.,</i> at 1328, 71 P. 3d, at 287, the court decided to defer to the trial judge's \"carefully considered ruling.\" <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[3]</sup> We granted certiorari, but dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction because the judgment was not yet final. <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>California,</i> 541 U. S. 428 (2004) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> After the California Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*168</span> of Appeal decided the remaining issues, we again granted certiorari. 543 U. S. 1042 (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The issue in this case is narrow but important. It concerns the scope of the first of three steps this Court enumerated in <i>Batson,</i> which together guide trial courts' constitutional review of peremptory strikes. Those three <i>Batson</i> steps should by now be familiar. First, the defendant must make out a prima facie case \"by showing that the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.\" 476 U. S., at 93-94 (citing <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Davis,</i> 426 U. S. 229, 239-242 (1976)).<sup>[4]</sup> Second, once the defendant has made out a prima facie case, the \"burden shifts to the State to explain adequately the racial exclusion\" by offering permissible race-neutral justifications for the strikes. 476 U. S., at 94; see also <i>Alexander</i> v. <i>Louisiana,</i> 405 U. S. 625, 632 (1972). Third, \"[i]f a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must then decide . . . whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful racial discrimination.\" <i>Purkett</i> v. <i>Elem,</i> 514 U. S. 765, 767 (1995) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>The question before us is whether <i>Batson</i> permits California to require at step one that \"the objector must show that it is more likely than not the other party's peremptory challenges, if unexplained, were based on impermissible group bias.\" 30 Cal. 4th, at 1318, 71 P. 3d, at 280. Although we recognize that States do have flexibility in formulating appropriate procedures to comply with <i>Batson,</i> we conclude that California's \"more likely than not\" standard is an inappropriate yardstick by which to measure the sufficiency of a prima facie case.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*169</span> We begin with <i>Batson</i> itself, which on its own terms provides no support for California's rule. There, we held that a prima facie case of discrimination can be made out by offering a wide variety of evidence,<sup>[5]</sup> so long as the sum of the proffered facts gives \"rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.\" 476 U. S., at 94. We explained that</p>\n<blockquote>\"a defendant may establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in selection of the petit jury solely on evidence concerning the prosecutor's exercise of peremptory challenges at the defendant's trial. To establish such a case, the defendant first must show that he is a member of a cognizable racial group, and that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant's race. Second, the defendant is entitled to rely on the fact, as to which there can be no dispute, that peremptory challenges constitute a jury selection practice that permits `those to discriminate who are of a mind to discriminate.' Finally, the defendant must show that these facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor used that practice to exclude the veniremen from the petit jury on account of their race.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 96 (citations omitted) (quoting <i>Avery</i> v. <i>Georgia,</i> 345 U. S. 559, 562 (1953)).</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, <i>Batson</i> held that because the petitioner had timely objected to the prosecutor's decision to strike \"all black persons on the venire,\" the trial court was in error when it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*170</span> \"flatly rejected the objection without requiring the prosecutor to give an explanation for his action.\" 476 U. S., at 100. We did not hold that the petitioner had proved discrimination. Rather, we remanded the case for further proceedings because the trial court failed to demand an explanation from the prosecutor \u0097 <i>i. e.,</i> to proceed to <i>Batson</i>'s second step \u0097 despite the fact that the petitioner's evidence supported <i>an inference</i> of discrimination. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Thus, in describing the burden-shifting framework, we assumed in <i>Batson</i> that the trial judge would have the benefit of all relevant circumstances, including the prosecutor's explanation, before deciding whether it was more likely than not that the challenge was improperly motivated. We did not intend the first step to be so onerous that a defendant would have to persuade the judge \u0097 on the basis of all the facts, some of which are impossible for the defendant to know with certainty \u0097 that the challenge was more likely than not the product of purposeful discrimination. Instead, a defendant satisfies the requirements of <i>Batson</i>'s first step by producing evidence sufficient to permit the trial judge to draw an inference that discrimination has occurred.</p>\n<p>Respondent, however, focuses on <i>Batson</i>'s ultimate sentence: \"If the trial court decides that the facts establish, prima facie, purposeful discrimination and the prosecutor does not come forward with a neutral explanation for his action, our precedents require that petitioner's conviction be reversed.\" <i>Ibid.</i> For this to be true, respondent contends, a <i>Batson</i> claim must prove the ultimate facts by a preponderance of the evidence in the prima facie case; otherwise, the argument goes, a prosecutor's failure to respond to a prima facie case would inexplicably entitle a defendant to judgment as a matter of law on the basis of nothing more than an inference that discrimination may have occurred. Brief for Respondent 13-18.</p>\n<p>Respondent's argument is misguided. <i>Batson,</i> of course, explicitly stated that the defendant ultimately carries the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*171</span> \"burden of persuasion\" to \"`prove the existence of purposeful discrimination.'\" 476 U. S., at 93 (quoting <i>Whitus</i> v. <i>Georgia,</i> 385 U. S. 545, 550 (1967)). This burden of persuasion \"rests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the strike.\" <i>Purkett,</i> 514 U. S., at 768. Thus, even if the State produces only a frivolous or utterly nonsensical justification for its strike, the case does not end \u0097 it merely proceeds to step three. <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[6]</sup> The first two <i>Batson</i> steps govern the production of evidence that allows the trial court to determine the persuasiveness of the defendant's constitutional claim. \"It is not until the <i>third</i> step that the persuasiveness of the justification becomes relevant \u0097 the step in which the trial court determines whether the opponent of the strike has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.\" <i>Purkett,</i> 514 U. S., at 768.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Batson</i>'s purposes further support our conclusion. The constitutional interests <i>Batson</i> sought to vindicate are not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*172</span> limited to the rights possessed by the defendant on trial, see 476 U. S., at 87, nor to those citizens who desire to participate \"in the administration of the law, as jurors,\" <i>Strauder</i> v. <i>West Virginia,</i> 100 U. S. 303, 308 (1880). Undoubtedly, the overriding interest in eradicating discrimination from our civic institutions suffers whenever an individual is excluded from making a significant contribution to governance on account of his race. Yet the \"harm from discriminatory jury selection extends beyond that inflicted on the defendant and the excluded juror to touch the entire community. Selection procedures that purposefully exclude black persons from juries undermine public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice.\" <i>Batson,</i> 476 U. S., at 87; see also <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Texas,</i> 311 U. S. 128, 130 (1940) (\"For racial discrimination to result in the exclusion from jury service of otherwise qualified groups not only violates our Constitution and the laws enacted under it but is at war with our basic concepts of a democratic society and a representative government\" (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p>The <i>Batson</i> framework is designed to produce actual answers to suspicions and inferences that discrimination may have infected the jury selection process. See 476 U. S., at 97-98, and n. 20. The inherent uncertainty present in inquiries of discriminatory purpose counsels against engaging in needless and imperfect speculation when a direct answer can be obtained by asking a simple question. See <i>Paulino</i> v. <i>Castro,</i> 371 F. 3d 1083, 1090 (CA9 2004) (\"[I]t does not matter that the prosecutor might have had good reasons . . . [;] [w]hat matters is the real reason they were stricken\" (emphasis deleted)); <i>Holloway</i> v. <i>Horn,</i> 355 F. 3d 707, 725 (CA3 2004) (speculation \"does not aid our inquiry into the reasons the prosecutor actually harbored\" for a peremptory strike). The three-step process thus simultaneously serves the public purposes <i>Batson</i> is designed to vindicate and encourages \"prompt rulings on objections to peremptory challenges without substantial disruption of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*173</span> jury selection process.\" <i>Hernandez</i> v. <i>New York,</i> 500 U. S. 352, 358-359 (1991) (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).</p>\n<p>The disagreements among the state-court judges who reviewed the record in this case illustrate the imprecision of relying on judicial speculation to resolve plausible claims of discrimination. In this case the inference of discrimination was sufficient to invoke a comment by the trial judge \"that `we are very close,'\" and on review, the California Supreme Court acknowledged that \"it certainly looks suspicious that all three African-American prospective jurors were removed from the jury.\" 30 Cal. 4th, at 1307, 1326, 71 P. 3d, at 273, 286. Those inferences that discrimination may have occurred were sufficient to establish a prima facie case under <i>Batson.</i></p>\n<p>The facts of this case well illustrate that California's \"more likely than not\" standard is at odds with the prima facie inquiry mandated by <i>Batson.</i> The judgment of the California Supreme Court is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the Court's opinion while maintaining here the views I set forth in my concurring opinion in <i>Miller-El</i> v. <i>Dretke, post,</i> p. 266.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court says that States \"have flexibility in formulating appropriate procedures to comply with <i>Batson</i> [v. <i>Kentucky,</i> 476 U. S. 79 (1986)],\" <i>ante,</i> at 168, but it then tells California how to comply with \"the prima facie inquiry mandated by <i>Batson,</i>\" <i>ante</i> this page. In <i>Batson</i> itself, this Court disclaimed any intent to instruct state courts on how to implement its holding. 476 U. S., at 99 (\"We decline, however, to formulate particular procedures to be followed upon a defendant's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*174</span> timely objection to a prosecutor's challenges\"); <i>id.,</i> at 99-100, n. 24. According to <i>Batson,</i> the Equal Protection Clause requires that prosecutors select juries based on factors other than race \u0097 not that litigants bear particular burdens of proof or persuasion. Because <i>Batson</i>'s burden-shifting approach is \"a prophylactic framework\" that polices racially discriminatory jury selection rather than \"an independent constitutional command,\" <i>Pennsylvania</i> v. <i>Finley,</i> 481 U. S. 551, 555 (1987), States have \"wide discretion, subject to the minimum requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, to experiment with solutions to difficult problems of policy,\" <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Robbins,</i> 528 U. S. 259, 273 (2000); <i>Dickerson</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 530 U. S. 428, 438-439 (2000). California's procedure falls comfortably within its broad discretion to craft its own rules of criminal procedure, and I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   <i>Theodore M.

Rptr. 2d, at 733.</p>\n<p>[3]  In dissent, Justice Kennard argued that \"[r]equiring a defendant to persuade the trial court of the prosecutor's discriminatory purpose at the first <i>Wheeler-Batson</i> stage short-circuits the process, and provides inadequate protection for the defendant's right to a fair trial . . . .\" 30 Cal. 4th, at 1333, 71 P. 3d, at 291. The proper standard for measuring a prima facie case under <i>Batson</i> is whether the defendant has identified actions by the prosecutor that, \"<i>if unexplained,</i> permit a reasonable inference of an improper purpose or motive.\" 30 Cal. 4th, at 1339, 71 P. 3d, at 294. Trial judges, Justice Kennard argued, should not speculate when it is not \"apparent that the [neutral] explanation was the true reason for the challenge.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1340, 71 P. 3d, at 295.</p>\n<p>[4]  An \"inference\" is generally understood to be a \"conclusion reached by considering other facts and deducing a logical consequence from them.\" Black's Law Dictionary 781 (7th ed. 1999).</p>\n<p>[5]  In <i>Batson,</i> we spoke of the methods by which prima facie cases could be proved in permissive terms. A defendant may satisfy his prima facie burden, we said, \"by relying solely on the facts concerning [the selection of the venire] <i>in his case.</i>\" 476 U. S., at 95 (emphasis in original). We declined to require proof of a pattern or practice because \"`[a] single invidiously discriminatory governmental act' is not `immunized by the absence of such discrimination in the making of other comparable decisions.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Arlington Heights</i> v. <i>Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.,</i> 429 U. S. 252, 266, n. 14 (1977)).</p>\n<p>[6]  In the unlikely hypothetical in which the prosecutor declines to respond to a trial judge's inquiry regarding his justification for making a strike, the evidence before the judge would consist not only of the original facts from which the prima facie case was established, but also the prosecutor's refusal to justify his strike in light of the court's request. Such a refusal would provide additional support for the inference of discrimination raised by a defendant's prima facie case. Cf. <i>United States ex rel. Vajtauer</i> v. <i>Commissioner of Immigration,</i> 273 U. S. 103, 111 (1927).</p>\n<p>[7]  This explanation comports with our interpretation of the burden-shifting framework in cases arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Furnco Constr. Corp.</i> v. <i>Waters,</i> 438 U. S. 567, 577 (1978) (noting that the <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp.</i> v. <i>Green,</i> 411 U. S. 792 (1973), framework \"is merely a sensible, orderly way to evaluate the evidence in light of common experience as it bears on the critical question of discrimination\"); see also <i>St. Mary's Honor Center</i> v. <i>Hicks,</i> 509 U. S. 502, 509-510, and n. 3 (1993) (holding that determinations at steps one and two of the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework \"can involve no credibility assessment\" because \"the burden-of-production determination necessarily <i>precedes</i> the credibility-assessment stage,\" and that the burden-shifting framework triggered by a defendant's prima face case is essentially just \"a means of `arranging the presentation of evidence'\" (quoting <i>Watson</i> v. <i>Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust,</i> 487 U. S. 977, 986 (1988))).</p>\n\n</div>",

Argued April 18, 2005\u2014Decided June 13, 2005\r\nPetitioner Johnson, a black man, was convicted in a California state\r\n  court of assaulting and murdering a white child. During jury selec-\r\n  tion, a number of prospective jurors were removed for cause until 43\r\n  eligible jurors remained, three of whom were black. The prosecutor\r\n  used 3 of his 12 peremptory challenges to remove the prospective\r\n  black jurors, resulting in an all-white jury. Defense counsel objected\r\n  to those strikes on the ground that they were unconstitutionally\r\n  based on race. The trial judge did not ask the prosecutor to explain\r\n  his strikes, but instead simply found that petitioner had failed to es-\r\n  tablish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination under the gov-\r\n  erning state precedent, People v. Wheeler, which required a showing\r\n  of a strong likelihood that the exercise of peremptory challenges was\r\n  based on group bias. The judge explained that, although the case\r\n  was close, his review of the record convinced him that the prosecu-\r\n  tor\u2019s strikes could be justified by race-neutral reasons. The Califor-\r\n  nia Court of Appeal set aside the conviction, but the State Supreme\r\n  Court reinstated it, stressing that Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79,\r\n  permits state courts to establish the standards used to evaluate the\r\n  sufficiency of prima facie cases of purposeful discrimination in jury\r\n  selection. Reviewing Batson, Wheeler, and their progeny, the court\r\n  concluded that Wheeler\u2019s \u201cstrong likelihood\u201d standard is entirely con-\r\n  sistent with Batson. Under Batson, the court held, a state court may\r\n  require the objector to present not merely enough evidence to permit\r\n  an inference that discrimination has occurred, but sufficiently strong\r\n  evidence to establish that the challenges, if not explained, were more\r\n  likely than not based on race. Applying that standard, the court ac-\r\n  knowledged that the exclusion of all three black prospective jurors\r\n  looked suspicious, but deferred to the trial judge\u2019s ruling.\r\n2                     JOHNSON v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                                 Syllabus\r\n\r\nHeld: California\u2019s \u201cmore likely than not\u201d standard is an inappropriate\r\n yardstick by which to measure the sufficiency of a prima facie case of\r\n purposeful discrimination in jury selection. This narrow but impor-\r\n tant issue concerns the scope of the first of three steps Batson enu-\r\n merated: (1) Once the defendant has made out a prima facie case and\r\n (2) the State has satisfied its burden to offer permissible race-neutral\r\n justifications for the strikes, e.g., 476 U. S., at 94, then (3) the trial\r\n court must decide whether the defendant has proved purposeful ra-\r\n cial discrimination, Purkett v. Elem, 514 U. S. 765. Batson does not\r\n permit California to require at step one that the objector show that it\r\n is more likely than not the other party\u2019s peremptory challenges, if\r\n unexplained, were based on impermissible group bias. The Batson\r\n Court held that a prima facie case can be made out by offering a wide\r\n variety of evidence, so long as the sum of the proffered facts gives\r\n \u201crise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.\u201d 476 U. S., at 94.\r\n The Court explained that to establish a prima facie case, the defen-\r\n dant must show that his membership in a cognizable racial group,\r\n the prosecutor\u2019s exercise of peremptory challenges to remove mem-\r\n bers of that group, the indisputable fact that such challenges permit\r\n those inclined to discriminate to do so, and any other relevant cir-\r\n cumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor excluded venire\r\n members on account of race. Id., at 96. The Court assumed that the\r\n trial judge would have the benefit of all relevant circumstances, in-\r\n cluding the prosecutor\u2019s explanation, before deciding whether it was\r\n more likely than not that the peremptory challenge was improperly\r\n motivated. The Court did not intend the first step to be so onerous\r\n that a defendant would have to persuade the judge\u2014on the basis of\r\n all the facts, some of which are impossible for the defendant to know\r\n with certainty\u2014that the challenge was more likely than not the\r\n product of purposeful discrimination. Instead, a defendant satisfies\r\n Batson\u2019s first step requirements by producing evidence sufficient to\r\n permit the trial judge to draw an inference that discrimination has\r\n occurred. The facts of this case illustrate that California\u2019s standard\r\n is at odds with the prima facie inquiry mandated by Batson. The\r\n permissible inferences of discrimination, which caused the trial judge\r\n to comment that the case was close and the California Supreme\r\n Court to acknowledge that it was suspicious that all three black pro-\r\n spective jurors were removed, were sufficient to establish a prima fa-\r\n cie case.

Kentucky, 476\r\nU. S. 79 (1986), the objector must show that it is more likely\r\nthan not that the other party\u2019s peremptory challenges, if\r\nunexplained, were based on impermissible group bias?\u201d Pet.\r\nfor Cert. i. Because both of those courts regularly review\r\nthe validity of convictions obtained in California criminal\r\ntrials, respondent, the State of California, agreed to peti-\r\ntioner\u2019s request that we grant certiorari and resolve the\r\nconflict. We agree with the Ninth Circuit that the question\r\npresented must be answered in the negative, and accord-\r\ningly reverse the judgment of the California Supreme Court.\r\n                              I\r\n  Petitioner Jay Shawn Johnson, a black male, was con-\r\nvicted in a California trial court of second-degree murder\r\nand assault on a white 19-month-old child, resulting in\r\ndeath. During jury selection, a number of prospective\r\njurors were removed for cause until 43 eligible jurors\r\n2                   JOHNSON v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nremained, 3 of whom were black. The prosecutor used 3 of\r\nhis 12 peremptory challenges to remove the black prospec-\r\ntive jurors. The resulting jury, including alternates, was\r\nall white.\r\n   After the prosecutor exercised the second of his three\r\nperemptory challenges against the prospective black\r\njurors, defense counsel objected on the ground that the\r\nchallenge was unconstitutionally based on race under both\r\nthe California and United States Constitutions. People v.\r\nJohnson, 30 Cal. 4th 1302, 1307, 71 P. 3d 270, 272\u2013273\r\n(2003).1 Defense counsel alleged that the prosecutor \u201chad\r\nno apparent reason to challenge this prospective juror\r\n\u2018other than [her] racial identity.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (alteration in\r\noriginal). The trial judge did not ask the prosecutor to\r\nexplain the rationale for his strikes. Instead, the judge\r\nsimply found that petitioner had failed to establish a\r\nprima facie case under the governing state precedent,\r\nPeople v. Wheeler, 22 Cal. 3d 258, 583 P. 2d 748 (1978),\r\nreasoning \u201c \u2018that there\u2019s not been shown a strong likelihood\r\nthat the exercise of the peremptory challenges were based\r\nupon a group rather than an individual basis,\u2019 \u201d 30 Cal.\r\n4th, at 1307, 71 P. 3d, at 272 (emphasis added). The judge\r\ndid, however, warn the prosecutor that \u201c \u2018we are very\r\nclose.\u2019 \u201d People v. Johnson, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 727, 729\r\n(2001).\r\n   Defense counsel made an additional motion the next day\r\nwhen the prosecutor struck the final remaining prospec-\r\ntive black juror. 30 Cal. 4th, at 1307, 71 P. 3d, at 272.\r\nCounsel argued that the prosecutor\u2019s decision to challenge\r\nall of the prospective black jurors constituted a \u201csystem-\r\natic attempt to exclude African-Americans from the jury\r\npanel.\u201d 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 729. The trial judge still did\r\nnot seek an explanation from the prosecutor. Instead, he\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  1 Petitioner\u2019s state objection was made under People v.

Specifically, the judge opined\r\nthat the black venire members had offered equivocal or\r\nconfused answers in their written questionnaires. 30 Cal.\r\n4th, at 1307\u20131308, 71 P. 3d, at 272\u2013273. Despite the fact\r\nthat \u201c \u2018the Court would not grant the challenges for cause,\r\nthere were answers . . . at least on the questionnaires\r\nthemselves [such] that the Court felt that there was suffi-\r\ncient basis\u2019 \u201d for the strikes. Id., at 1308, 71 P. 3d, at 273\r\n(brackets added). Therefore, even considering that all of\r\nthe prospective black jurors had been stricken from the\r\npool, the judge determined that petitioner had failed to\r\nestablish a prima facie case.\r\n   The California Court of Appeal set aside the conviction.\r\nPeople v. Johnson, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 727 (2001). Over the\r\ndissent of one judge, the majority ruled that the trial judge\r\nhad erred by requiring petitioner to establish a \u201cstrong\r\nlikelihood\u201d that the peremptory strikes had been imper-\r\nmissibly based on race. Instead, the trial judge should\r\nhave only required petitioner to proffer enough evidence to\r\nsupport an \u201cinference\u201d of discrimination.2 The Court of\r\nAppeal\u2019s holding relied on decisions of this Court, prior\r\nCalifornia case law, and the decision of the United States\r\nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Wade v. Terhune,\r\n202 F. 3d 1190 (2000). Applying the proper \u201creasonable\r\ninference\u201d standard, the majority concluded that peti-\r\ntioner had produced sufficient evidence to support a prima\r\nfacie case.\r\n   Respondent appealed, and the California Supreme\r\nCourt reinstated petitioner\u2019s conviction over the dissent of\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   2 In reaching this holding, the Court of Appeal rejected the notion\r\n\r\nthat a showing of a \u201c \u2018strong likelihood\u2019 \u201d is equivalent to a \u201c \u2018reasonable\r\ninference.\u2019 \u201d To conclude so would \u201cbe as novel a proposition as the idea\r\nthat \u2018clear and convincing evidence\u2019 has always meant a \u2018preponderance\r\nof the evidence.\u2019 \u201d 105 Cal.

Kentucky,\r\n476 U. S. 79 (1986), left to state courts the task of estab-\r\nlishing the standards used to evaluate the sufficiency of\r\ndefendants\u2019 prima facie cases. 30 Cal. 4th, at 1314, 71\r\nP. 3d, at 277. The court then reviewed Batson, Wheeler,\r\nand those decisions\u2019 progeny, and concluded that\r\n\u201cWheeler\u2019s terms \u2018strong likelihood\u2019 and \u2018reasonable infer-\r\nence\u2019 state the same standard\u201d\u2014one that is entirely con-\r\nsistent with Batson. 30 Cal. 4th, at 1313, 71 P. 3d, at 277.\r\nA prima facie case under Batson establishes a \u201c \u2018legally\r\nmandatory, rebuttable presumption,\u2019 \u201d it does not merely\r\nconstitute \u201cenough evidence to permit the inference\u201d that\r\ndiscrimination has occurred. 30 Cal. 4th, at 1315, 71\r\nP. 3d, at 278. Batson, the court held, \u201cpermits a court to\r\nrequire the objector to present, not merely \u2018some evidence\u2019\r\npermitting the inference, but \u2018strong evidence\u2019 that makes\r\ndiscriminatory intent more likely than not if the challenges\r\nare not explained.\u201d 30 Cal. 4th, at 1316, 71 P. 3d, at 278.\r\nThe court opined that while this burden is \u201cnot onerous,\u201d it\r\nremains \u201csubstantial.\u201d Ibid., 71 P. 3d, at 279.\r\n   Applying that standard, the court acknowledged that\r\nthe case involved the \u201chighly relevant\u201d circumstance that\r\na black defendant was \u201ccharged with killing \u2018his White\r\ngirlfriend\u2019s child,\u2019 \u201d and that \u201cit certainly looks suspicious\r\nthat all three African-American prospective jurors were\r\nremoved from the jury.\u201d Id., at 1326, 71 P. 3d, at 286. Yet\r\npetitioner\u2019s Batson showing, the court held, consisted\r\n\u201cprimarily of the statistical disparity of peremptory chal-\r\nlenges between African-Americans and others.\u201d 30 Cal.\r\n4th, at 1327, 71 P. 3d, at 287. Although those statistics\r\nwere indeed \u201ctroubling and, as the trial court stated, the\r\nquestion was close,\u201d id., at 1328, 71 P. 3d, at 287, the court\r\ndecided to defer to the trial judge\u2019s \u201ccarefully considered\r\nruling.\u201d Ibid.3 We granted certiorari, but dismissed the\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n    3 In   dissent, Justice Kennard argued that \u201c[r]equiring a defendant to\r\n                      Cite as: 545 U.

S.\r\n___ (2005).\r\n                              II\r\n   The issue in this case is narrow but important. It con-\r\ncerns the scope of the first of three steps this Court enu-\r\nmerated in Batson, which together guide trial courts\u2019\r\nconstitutional review of peremptory strikes. Those three\r\nBatson steps should by now be familiar. First, the defen-\r\ndant must make out a prima facie case \u201cby showing that\r\nthe totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference\r\nof discriminatory purpose.\u201d 476 U. S., at 93\u201394 (citing\r\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 239\u2013242 (1976)).4\r\nSecond, once the defendant has made out a prima facie\r\ncase, the \u201cburden shifts to the State to explain adequately\r\nthe racial exclusion\u201d by offering permissible race-neutral\r\njustifications for the strikes. 476 U. S., at 94; see also\r\nAlexander v. Louisiana, 405 U. S. 625, 632 (1972). Third,\r\n\u201c[i]f a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court\r\nmust then decide . . . whether the opponent of the strike\r\nhas proved purposeful racial discrimination.\u201d Purkett v.\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\npersuade the trial court of the prosecutor\u2019s discriminatory purpose at\r\nthe first Wheeler-Batson stage short-circuits the process, and provides\r\ninadequate protection for the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial . . . .\u201d 30\r\nCal. 4th, at 1333, 71 P. 3d, at 291. The proper standard for measuring\r\na prima facie case under Batson is whether the defendant has identified\r\nactions by the prosecutor that, \u201cif unexplained, permit a reasonable\r\ninference of an improper purpose or motive.\u201d 30 Cal. 4th, at 1339, 71\r\nP. 3d, at 294. Trial judges, Justice Kennard argued, should not specu-\r\nlate when it is not \u201capparent that the [neutral] explanation was the\r\ntrue reason for the challenge.\u201d Id., at 1340, 71 P. 3d, at 295.\r\n  4 An \u201cinference\u201d is generally understood to be a \u201cconclusion reached\r\n\r\nby considering other facts and deducing a logical consequence from\r\nthem.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 781 (7th ed. 1999).\r\n6                     JOHNSON v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nElem, 514 U. S. 765, 767 (1995) (per curiam).\r\n  The question before us is whether Batson permits Cali-\r\nfornia to require at step one that \u201cthe objector must show\r\nthat it is more likely than not the other party\u2019s peremp-\r\ntory challenges, if unexplained, were based on impermis-\r\nsible group bias.\u201d 30 Cal. 4th, at 1318, 71 P. 3d, at 280.\r\nAlthough we recognize that States do have flexibility in\r\nformulating appropriate procedures to comply with Bat-\r\nson, we conclude that California\u2019s \u201cmore likely than not\u201d\r\nstandard is an inappropriate yardstick by which to meas-\r\nure the sufficiency of a prima facie case.\r\n  We begin with Batson itself, which on its own terms\r\nprovides no support for California\u2019s rule. There, we held\r\nthat a prima facie case of discrimination can be made out\r\nby offering a wide variety of evidence,5 so long as the sum\r\nof the proffered facts gives \u201crise to an inference of dis-\r\ncriminatory purpose.\u201d 476 U. S., at 94. We explained that\r\n     \u201ca defendant may establish a prima facie case of pur-\r\n     poseful discrimination in selection of the petit jury\r\n     solely on evidence concerning the prosecutor\u2019s exercise\r\n     of peremptory challenges at the defendant\u2019s trial. To\r\n     establish such a case, the defendant first must show\r\n     that he is a member of a cognizable racial group, and\r\n     that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory chal-\r\n     lenges to remove from the venire members of the de-\r\n     fendant\u2019s race. Second, the defendant is entitled to\r\n     rely on the fact, as to which there can be no dispute,\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  5 In Batson, we spoke of the methods by which prima facie cases could\r\n\r\nbe proved in permissive terms. A defendant may satisfy his prima facie\r\nburden, we said, \u201cby relying solely on the facts concerning [the selection\r\nof the venire] in his case.\u201d 476 U. S., at 95 (emphasis in original). We\r\ndeclined to require proof of a pattern or practice because \u201c \u2018[a] single\r\ninvidiously discriminatory governmental act\u2019 is not \u2018immunized by the\r\nabsence of such discrimination in the making of other comparable\r\ndecisions.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing\r\nDevelopment Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 266, n. 14 (1977)).\r\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           7\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n    that peremptory challenges constitute a jury selection\r\n    practice that permits \u2018those to discriminate who are of\r\n    a mind to discriminate.\u2019 Finally, the defendant must\r\n    show that these facts and any other relevant circum-\r\n    stances raise an inference that the prosecutor used\r\n    that practice to exclude the veniremen from the petit\r\n    jury on account of their race.\u201d Id., at 96 (citations\r\n    omitted) (quoting Avery v. Georgia, 345 U. S. 559, 562\r\n    (1953)).\r\n   Indeed, Batson held that because the petitioner had\r\ntimely objected to the prosecutor\u2019s decision to strike \u201call\r\nblack persons on the venire,\u201d the trial court was in error\r\nwhen it \u201cflatly rejected the objection without requiring the\r\nprosecutor to give an explanation for his action.\u201d 476\r\nU. S., at 100. We did not hold that the petitioner had\r\nproved discrimination. Rather, we remanded the case for\r\nfurther proceedings because the trial court failed to de-\r\nmand an explanation from the prosecutor\u2014i.e., to proceed\r\nto Batson\u2019s second step\u2014despite the fact that the peti-\r\ntioner\u2019s evidence supported an inference of discrimination.\r\nIbid.\r\n   Thus, in describing the burden-shifting framework, we\r\nassumed in Batson that the trial judge would have the\r\nbenefit of all relevant circumstances, including the prose-\r\ncutor\u2019s explanation, before deciding whether it was more\r\nlikely than not that the challenge was improperly moti-\r\nvated. We did not intend the first step to be so onerous\r\nthat a defendant would have to persuade the judge\u2014on\r\nthe basis of all the facts, some of which are impossible for\r\nthe defendant to know with certainty\u2014that the challenge\r\nwas more likely than not the product of purposeful dis-\r\ncrimination. Instead, a defendant satisfies the require-\r\nments of Batson\u2019s first step by producing evidence suffi-\r\ncient to permit the trial judge to draw an inference that\r\ndiscrimination has occurred.\r\n8                     JOHNSON v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   Respondent, however, focuses on Batson\u2019s ultimate\r\nsentence: \u201cIf the trial court decides that the facts estab-\r\nlish, prima facie, purposeful discrimination and the prose-\r\ncutor does not come forward with a neutral explanation for\r\nhis action, our precedents require that petitioner\u2019s convic-\r\ntion be reversed.\u201d Ibid. For this to be true, respondent\r\ncontends, a Batson claim must prove the ultimate facts by\r\na preponderance of the evidence in the prima facie case;\r\notherwise, the argument goes, a prosecutor\u2019s failure to\r\nrespond to a prima facie case would inexplicably entitle a\r\ndefendant to judgment as a matter of law on the basis of\r\nnothing more than an inference that discrimination may\r\nhave occurred. Brief for Respondent 13\u201318.\r\n   Respondent\u2019s argument is misguided. Batson, of course,\r\nexplicitly stated that the defendant ultimately carries the\r\n\u201cburden of persuasion\u201d to \u201c \u2018prove the existence of purpose-\r\nful discrimination.\u2019 \u201d 476 U. S., at 93 (quoting Whitus v.\r\nGeorgia, 385 U. S. 545, 550 (1967)). This burden of per-\r\nsuasion \u201crests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of\r\nthe strike.\u201d Purkett, 514 U. S., at 768. Thus, even if the\r\nState produces only a frivolous or utterly nonsensical\r\njustification for its strike, the case does not end\u2014it merely\r\nproceeds to step three. Ibid.6 The first two Batson steps\r\ngovern the production of evidence that allows the trial\r\ncourt to determine the persuasiveness of the defendant\u2019s\r\nconstitutional claim. \u201cIt is not until the third step that the\r\npersuasiveness of the justification becomes relevant\u2014the\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  6 In the unlikely hypothetical in which the prosecutor declines to\r\n\r\nrespond to a trial judge\u2019s inquiry regarding his justification for making\r\na strike, the evidence before the judge would consist not only of the\r\noriginal facts from which the prima facie case was established, but also\r\nthe prosecutor\u2019s refusal to justify his strike in light of the court\u2019s\r\nrequest. Such a refusal would provide additional support for the\r\ninference of discrimination raised by a defendant\u2019s prima facie case. Cf.\r\nUnited States ex rel. Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration, 273\r\nU. S. 103, 111 (1927).\r\n                     Cite as: 545 U.

The\r\nconstitutional interests Batson sought to vindicate are not\r\nlimited to the rights possessed by the defendant on trial,\r\nsee 476 U. S., at 87, nor to those citizens who desire to\r\nparticipate \u201cin the administration of the law, as jurors,\u201d\r\nStrauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303, 308 (1880). Un-\r\ndoubtedly, the overriding interest in eradicating discrimi-\r\nnation from our civic institutions suffers whenever an\r\nindividual is excluded from making a significant contribu-\r\ntion to governance on account of his race. Yet the \u201charm\r\nfrom discriminatory jury selection extends beyond that\r\ninflicted on the defendant and the excluded juror to touch\r\nthe entire community. Selection procedures that purpose-\r\nfully exclude black persons from juries undermine public\r\nconfidence in the fairness of our system of justice.\u201d Bat-\r\nson, 476 U. S., at 87; see also Smith v. Texas, 311 U. S.\r\n128, 130 (1940) (\u201cFor racial discrimination to result in the\r\nexclusion from jury service of otherwise qualified groups\r\nnot only violates our Constitution and the laws enacted\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   7 This explanation comports with our interpretation of the burden-\r\n\r\nshifting framework in cases arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights\r\nAct of 1964. See, e.g., Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U. S. 567,\r\n577 (1978) (noting that the McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411\r\nU. S. 792 (1973), framework \u201cis merely a sensible, orderly way to\r\nevaluate the evidence in light of common experience as it bears on the\r\ncritical question of discrimination\u201d); see also St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v.\r\nHicks, 509 U. S. 502, 509\u2013510, and n. 3 (1993) (holding that determina-\r\ntions at steps one and two of the McDonnell Douglas framework \u201ccan\r\ninvolve no credibility assessment\u201d because \u201cthe burden-of-production\r\ndetermination necessarily precedes the credibility-assessment stage,\u201d\r\nand that the burden-shifting framework triggered by a defendant\u2019s\r\nprima face case is essentially just \u201ca means of \u2018arranging the presenta-\r\ntion of evidence\u2019 \u201d (quoting Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487\r\nU. S. 977, 986 (1988)).\r\n10                JOHNSON v. CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nunder it but it is at war with our basic concepts of a de-\r\nmocratic society and a representative government\u201d (foot-\r\nnote omitted)).\r\n   The Batson framework is designed to produce actual\r\nanswers to suspicions and inferences that discrimination\r\nmay have infected the jury selection process. See 476\r\nU. S., at 97\u201398, and n. 20. The inherent uncertainty\r\npresent in inquiries of discriminatory purpose counsels\r\nagainst engaging in needless and imperfect speculation\r\nwhen a direct answer can be obtained by asking a simple\r\nquestion. See Paulino v. Castro, 371 F. 3d 1083, 1090\r\n(CA9 2004) (\u201c[I]t does not matter that the prosecutor\r\nmight have had good reasons . . . [w]hat matters is the real\r\nreason they were stricken\u201d (emphasis deleted)); Holloway\r\nv. Horn, 355 F. 3d 707, 725 (CA3 2004) (speculation \u201cdoes\r\nnot aid our inquiry into the reasons the prosecutor actu-\r\nally harbored\u201d for a peremptory strike). The three-step\r\nprocess thus simultaneously serves the public purposes\r\nBatson is designed to vindicate and encourages \u201cprompt\r\nrulings on objections to peremptory challenges without\r\nsubstantial disruption of the jury selection process.\u201d\r\nHernandez v. New York, 500 U. S. 352, 358\u2013359 (1991)\r\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.).\r\n   The disagreements among the state-court judges who\r\nreviewed the record in this case illustrate the imprecision\r\nof relying on judicial speculation to resolve plausible\r\nclaims of discrimination. In this case the inference of\r\ndiscrimination was sufficient to invoke a comment by the\r\ntrial judge \u201cthat \u2018we are very close,\u2019 \u201d and on review, the\r\nCalifornia Supreme acknowledged that \u201cit certainly looks\r\nsuspicious that all three African-American prospective\r\njurors were removed from the jury.\u201d 30 Cal. 4th, at 1307,\r\n1326, 71 P. 3d, at 273, 286. Those inferences that dis-\r\ncrimination may have occurred were sufficient to establish\r\na prima facie case under Batson.\r\n   The facts of this case well illustrate that California\u2019s\r\n                 Cite as: 545 U.

In Batson itself, this\r\nCourt disclaimed any intent to instruct state courts on\r\nhow to implement its holding. 476 U.

According to Bat-\r\nson, the Equal Protection Clause requires that prosecutors\r\nselect juries based on factors other than race\u2014not that\r\nlitigants bear particular burdens of proof or persuasion.\r\nBecause Batson\u2019s burden-shifting approach is \u201ca prophy-\r\nlactic framework\u201d that polices racially discriminatory jury\r\nselection rather than \u201can independent constitutional\r\ncommand,\u201d Pennsylvania v.

S. 79 (1986), the objector must show that it is more likely than not that the other party's peremptory challenges, if unexplained, were based on impermissible group bias?\" Pet. for Cert. i. Because both of those courts regularly review the validity of convictions obtained in California criminal trials, respondent, the State of California, agreed to petitioner's request that we grant certiorari and resolve the conflict. We agree with the Ninth Circuit that the question presented must be answered in the negative, and accordingly reverse the judgment of the California Supreme Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Jay Shawn Johnson, a black male, was convicted in a California trial court of second-degree murder and assault on a white 19-month-old child, resulting in death. During jury selection, a number of prospective jurors were removed for cause until 43 eligible jurors remained, 3 of whom were black. The prosecutor used 3 of his 12 peremptory challenges to remove the black prospective jurors. The resulting jury, including alternates, was all white.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*165</span> After the prosecutor exercised the second of his three peremptory challenges against the prospective black jurors, defense counsel objected on the ground that the challenge was unconstitutionally based on race under both the California and United States Constitutions. <i>People</i> v. <i>Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1850056\"><a href=\"/opinion/1850056/state-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1302</span></a></span>, 1307, 71 P. 3d 270, 272-273 (2003).<sup>[1]</sup> Defense counsel alleged that the prosecutor \"had no apparent reason to challenge this prospective juror `other than [her] racial identity.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (alteration in original). The trial judge did not ask the prosecutor to explain the rationale for his strikes. Instead, the judge simply found that petitioner had failed to establish a prima facie case under the governing state precedent, <i>People</i> v. <i>Wheeler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1291154\"><a href=\"/opinion/1291154/people-v-wheeler/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 583 P. 2d 748 (1978), reasoning \"`that there's not been shown a <i>strong likelihood</i> that the exercise of the peremptory challenges were based upon a group rather than an individual basis,'\" 30 Cal. 4th, at 1307, 71 P. 3d, at 272 (emphasis added). The judge did, however, warn the prosecutor that \"`we are very close.'\" <i>People</i> v. <i>Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></span>, 729 (Ct. App. 2001).</p>\n<p>Defense counsel made an additional motion the next day when the prosecutor struck the final remaining prospective black juror. 30 Cal. 4th, at 1307, 71 P. 3d, at 272. Counsel argued that the prosecutor's decision to challenge all of the prospective black jurors constituted a \"systematic attempt to exclude African-Americans from the jury panel.\" 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 729. The trial judge still did not seek an explanation from the prosecutor. Instead, she explained that her own examination of the record had convinced her that the prosecutor's strikes could be justified by race-neutral reasons. Specifically, the judge opined that the black venire members had offered equivocal or confused answers in their written questionnaires. 30 Cal. 4th, at 1307-1308, 71 P. 3d, at 272-273. Despite the fact that \"`the Court would not grant the challenges for cause, there were answers <span class=\"star-pagination\">*166</span> . . . at least on the questionnaires themselves [such] that the Court felt that there was sufficient basis'\" for the strikes. <i>Id.,</i> at 1308, 71 P. 3d, at 273 (brackets added). Therefore, even considering that all of the prospective black jurors had been stricken from the pool, the judge determined that petitioner had failed to establish a prima facie case.</p>\n<p>The California Court of Appeal set aside the conviction. <i>People</i> v. <i>Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></span> (2001). Over the dissent of one judge, the majority ruled that the trial judge had erred by requiring petitioner to establish a \"strong likelihood\" that the peremptory strikes had been impermissibly based on race. Instead, the trial judge should have only required petitioner to proffer enough evidence to support an \"inference\" of discrimination.<sup>[2]</sup> The Court of Appeal's holding relied on decisions of this Court, prior California case law, and the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in <i>Wade</i> v. <i>Terhune,</i> 202 F. 3d 1190 (2000). Applying the proper \"reasonable inference\" standard, the majority concluded that petitioner had produced sufficient evidence to support a prima facie case.</p>\n<p>Respondent appealed, and the California Supreme Court reinstated petitioner's conviction over the dissent of two justices. The court stressed that <i>Batson</i> v. <i>Kentucky,</i> 476 U. S. 79 (1986), left to state courts the task of establishing the standards used to evaluate the sufficiency of defendants' prima facie cases. 30 Cal. 4th, at 1314, 71 P. 3d, at 277. The court then reviewed <i>Batson, Wheeler,</i> and those decisions' progeny, and concluded that \"<i>Wheeler</i>'s terms `strong likelihood' and `reasonable inference' state the same standard\" \u0097 one that is entirely consistent with <i>Batson.</i> 30 Cal. 4th, at 1313, 71 P. 3d, at 277. A prima facie case under <i>Batson</i> establishes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*167</span> a \"`legally mandatory, rebuttable presumption,'\" it does not merely constitute \"enough evidence to <i>permit the inference</i>\" that discrimination has occurred. 30 Cal. 4th, at 1315, 71 P. 3d, at 278. <i>Batson,</i> the court held, \"permits a court to require the objector to present, not merely `some evidence' permitting the inference, but `strong evidence' that makes discriminatory intent <i>more likely than not</i> if the challenges are not explained.\" 30 Cal. 4th, at 1316, 71 P. 3d, at 278. The court opined that while this burden is \"not onerous,\" it remains \"substantial.\" <i>Ibid.,</i> 71 P. 3d, at 279.</p>\n<p>Applying that standard, the court acknowledged that the case involved the \"highly relevant\" circumstance that a black defendant was \"charged with killing `his White girlfriend's child,'\" and that \"it certainly looks suspicious that all three African-American prospective jurors were removed from the jury.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1326, 71 P. 3d, at 286. Yet petitioner's <i>Batson</i> showing, the court held, consisted \"primarily of the statistical disparity of peremptory challenges between African-Americans and others.\" 30 Cal. 4th, at 1327, 71 P. 3d, at 287. Although those statistics were indeed \"troubling and, as the trial court stated, the question was close,\" <i>id.,</i> at 1328, 71 P. 3d, at 287, the court decided to defer to the trial judge's \"carefully considered ruling.\" <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[3]</sup> We granted certiorari, but dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction because the judgment was not yet final. <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>California,</i> 541 U. S. 428 (2004) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> After the California Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*168</span> of Appeal decided the remaining issues, we again granted certiorari. 543 U. S. 1042 (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The issue in this case is narrow but important. It concerns the scope of the first of three steps this Court enumerated in <i>Batson,</i> which together guide trial courts' constitutional review of peremptory strikes. Those three <i>Batson</i> steps should by now be familiar. First, the defendant must make out a prima facie case \"by showing that the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.\" 476 U. S., at 93-94 (citing <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Davis,</i> 426 U. S. 229, 239-242 (1976)).<sup>[4]</sup> Second, once the defendant has made out a prima facie case, the \"burden shifts to the State to explain adequately the racial exclusion\" by offering permissible race-neutral justifications for the strikes. 476 U. S., at 94; see also <i>Alexander</i> v. <i>Louisiana,</i> 405 U. S. 625, 632 (1972). Third, \"[i]f a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must then decide . . . whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful racial discrimination.\" <i>Purkett</i> v. <i>Elem,</i> 514 U. S. 765, 767 (1995) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>The question before us is whether <i>Batson</i> permits California to require at step one that \"the objector must show that it is more likely than not the other party's peremptory challenges, if unexplained, were based on impermissible group bias.\" 30 Cal. 4th, at 1318, 71 P. 3d, at 280. Although we recognize that States do have flexibility in formulating appropriate procedures to comply with <i>Batson,</i> we conclude that California's \"more likely than not\" standard is an inappropriate yardstick by which to measure the sufficiency of a prima facie case.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*169</span> We begin with <i>Batson</i> itself, which on its own terms provides no support for California's rule. There, we held that a prima facie case of discrimination can be made out by offering a wide variety of evidence,<sup>[5]</sup> so long as the sum of the proffered facts gives \"rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.\" 476 U. S., at 94. We explained that</p>\n<blockquote>\"a defendant may establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in selection of the petit jury solely on evidence concerning the prosecutor's exercise of peremptory challenges at the defendant's trial. To establish such a case, the defendant first must show that he is a member of a cognizable racial group, and that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant's race. Second, the defendant is entitled to rely on the fact, as to which there can be no dispute, that peremptory challenges constitute a jury selection practice that permits `those to discriminate who are of a mind to discriminate.' Finally, the defendant must show that these facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor used that practice to exclude the veniremen from the petit jury on account of their race.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 96 (citations omitted) (quoting <i>Avery</i> v. <i>Georgia,</i> 345 U. S. 559, 562 (1953)).</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, <i>Batson</i> held that because the petitioner had timely objected to the prosecutor's decision to strike \"all black persons on the venire,\" the trial court was in error when it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*170</span> \"flatly rejected the objection without requiring the prosecutor to give an explanation for his action.\" 476 U. S., at 100. We did not hold that the petitioner had proved discrimination. Rather, we remanded the case for further proceedings because the trial court failed to demand an explanation from the prosecutor \u0097 <i>i. e.,</i> to proceed to <i>Batson</i>'s second step \u0097 despite the fact that the petitioner's evidence supported <i>an inference</i> of discrimination. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Thus, in describing the burden-shifting framework, we assumed in <i>Batson</i> that the trial judge would have the benefit of all relevant circumstances, including the prosecutor's explanation, before deciding whether it was more likely than not that the challenge was improperly motivated. We did not intend the first step to be so onerous that a defendant would have to persuade the judge \u0097 on the basis of all the facts, some of which are impossible for the defendant to know with certainty \u0097 that the challenge was more likely than not the product of purposeful discrimination. Instead, a defendant satisfies the requirements of <i>Batson</i>'s first step by producing evidence sufficient to permit the trial judge to draw an inference that discrimination has occurred.</p>\n<p>Respondent, however, focuses on <i>Batson</i>'s ultimate sentence: \"If the trial court decides that the facts establish, prima facie, purposeful discrimination and the prosecutor does not come forward with a neutral explanation for his action, our precedents require that petitioner's conviction be reversed.\" <i>Ibid.</i> For this to be true, respondent contends, a <i>Batson</i> claim must prove the ultimate facts by a preponderance of the evidence in the prima facie case; otherwise, the argument goes, a prosecutor's failure to respond to a prima facie case would inexplicably entitle a defendant to judgment as a matter of law on the basis of nothing more than an inference that discrimination may have occurred. Brief for Respondent 13-18.</p>\n<p>Respondent's argument is misguided. <i>Batson,</i> of course, explicitly stated that the defendant ultimately carries the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*171</span> \"burden of persuasion\" to \"`prove the existence of purposeful discrimination.'\" 476 U. S., at 93 (quoting <i>Whitus</i> v. <i>Georgia,</i> 385 U. S. 545, 550 (1967)). This burden of persuasion \"rests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the strike.\" <i>Purkett,</i> 514 U. S., at 768. Thus, even if the State produces only a frivolous or utterly nonsensical justification for its strike, the case does not end \u0097 it merely proceeds to step three. <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[6]</sup> The first two <i>Batson</i> steps govern the production of evidence that allows the trial court to determine the persuasiveness of the defendant's constitutional claim. \"It is not until the <i>third</i> step that the persuasiveness of the justification becomes relevant \u0097 the step in which the trial court determines whether the opponent of the strike has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.\" <i>Purkett,</i> 514 U. S., at 768.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Batson</i>'s purposes further support our conclusion. The constitutional interests <i>Batson</i> sought to vindicate are not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*172</span> limited to the rights possessed by the defendant on trial, see 476 U. S., at 87, nor to those citizens who desire to participate \"in the administration of the law, as jurors,\" <i>Strauder</i> v. <i>West Virginia,</i> 100 U. S. 303, 308 (1880). Undoubtedly, the overriding interest in eradicating discrimination from our civic institutions suffers whenever an individual is excluded from making a significant contribution to governance on account of his race. Yet the \"harm from discriminatory jury selection extends beyond that inflicted on the defendant and the excluded juror to touch the entire community. Selection procedures that purposefully exclude black persons from juries undermine public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice.\" <i>Batson,</i> 476 U. S., at 87; see also <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Texas,</i> 311 U. S. 128, 130 (1940) (\"For racial discrimination to result in the exclusion from jury service of otherwise qualified groups not only violates our Constitution and the laws enacted under it but is at war with our basic concepts of a democratic society and a representative government\" (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p>The <i>Batson</i> framework is designed to produce actual answers to suspicions and inferences that discrimination may have infected the jury selection process. See 476 U. S., at 97-98, and n. 20. The inherent uncertainty present in inquiries of discriminatory purpose counsels against engaging in needless and imperfect speculation when a direct answer can be obtained by asking a simple question. See <i>Paulino</i> v. <i>Castro,</i> 371 F. 3d 1083, 1090 (CA9 2004) (\"[I]t does not matter that the prosecutor might have had good reasons . . . [;] [w]hat matters is the real reason they were stricken\" (emphasis deleted)); <i>Holloway</i> v. <i>Horn,</i> 355 F. 3d 707, 725 (CA3 2004) (speculation \"does not aid our inquiry into the reasons the prosecutor actually harbored\" for a peremptory strike). The three-step process thus simultaneously serves the public purposes <i>Batson</i> is designed to vindicate and encourages \"prompt rulings on objections to peremptory challenges without substantial disruption of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*173</span> jury selection process.\" <i>Hernandez</i> v. <i>New York,</i> 500 U. S. 352, 358-359 (1991) (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).</p>\n<p>The disagreements among the state-court judges who reviewed the record in this case illustrate the imprecision of relying on judicial speculation to resolve plausible claims of discrimination. In this case the inference of discrimination was sufficient to invoke a comment by the trial judge \"that `we are very close,'\" and on review, the California Supreme Court acknowledged that \"it certainly looks suspicious that all three African-American prospective jurors were removed from the jury.\" 30 Cal. 4th, at 1307, 1326, 71 P. 3d, at 273, 286. Those inferences that discrimination may have occurred were sufficient to establish a prima facie case under <i>Batson.</i></p>\n<p>The facts of this case well illustrate that California's \"more likely than not\" standard is at odds with the prima facie inquiry mandated by <i>Batson.</i> The judgment of the California Supreme Court is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the Court's opinion while maintaining here the views I set forth in my concurring opinion in <i>Miller-El</i> v. <i>Dretke, post,</i> p. 266.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court says that States \"have flexibility in formulating appropriate procedures to comply with <i>Batson</i> [v. <i>Kentucky,</i> 476 U. S. 79 (1986)],\" <i>ante,</i> at 168, but it then tells California how to comply with \"the prima facie inquiry mandated by <i>Batson,</i>\" <i>ante</i> this page. In <i>Batson</i> itself, this Court disclaimed any intent to instruct state courts on how to implement its holding. 476 U. S., at 99 (\"We decline, however, to formulate particular procedures to be followed upon a defendant's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*174</span> timely objection to a prosecutor's challenges\"); <i>id.,</i> at 99-100, n. 24. According to <i>Batson,</i> the Equal Protection Clause requires that prosecutors select juries based on factors other than race \u0097 not that litigants bear particular burdens of proof or persuasion. Because <i>Batson</i>'s burden-shifting approach is \"a prophylactic framework\" that polices racially discriminatory jury selection rather than \"an independent constitutional command,\" <i>Pennsylvania</i> v. <i>Finley,</i> 481 U. S. 551, 555 (1987), States have \"wide discretion, subject to the minimum requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, to experiment with solutions to difficult problems of policy,\" <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Robbins,</i> 528 U. S. 259, 273 (2000); <i>Dickerson</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 530 U. S. 428, 438-439 (2000). California's procedure falls comfortably within its broad discretion to craft its own rules of criminal procedure, and I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   <i>Theodore M.

Scheidegger</i> and <i>Charles L. Hobson</i> filed a brief for the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation as <i>amicus curiae</i> urging affirmance.</p>\n<p>[1]  Petitioner's state objection was made under <i>People</i> v. <i>Wheeler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1291154\"><a href=\"/opinion/1291154/people-v-wheeler/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 583 P. 2d 748 (1978).</p>\n<p>[2]  In reaching this holding, the Court of Appeal rejected the notion that a showing of a \"`strong likelihood'\" is equivalent to a \"`reasonable inference.'\" To conclude so would \"be as novel a proposition as the idea that `clear and convincing evidence' has always meant a `preponderance of the evidence.'\" 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 733.</p>\n<p>[3]  In dissent, Justice Kennard argued that \"[r]equiring a defendant to persuade the trial court of the prosecutor's discriminatory purpose at the first <i>Wheeler-Batson</i> stage short-circuits the process, and provides inadequate protection for the defendant's right to a fair trial . . . .\" 30 Cal. 4th, at 1333, 71 P. 3d, at 291. The proper standard for measuring a prima facie case under <i>Batson</i> is whether the defendant has identified actions by the prosecutor that, \"<i>if unexplained,</i> permit a reasonable inference of an improper purpose or motive.\" 30 Cal. 4th, at 1339, 71 P. 3d, at 294. Trial judges, Justice Kennard argued, should not speculate when it is not \"apparent that the [neutral] explanation was the true reason for the challenge.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1340, 71 P. 3d, at 295.</p>\n<p>[4]  An \"inference\" is generally understood to be a \"conclusion reached by considering other facts and deducing a logical consequence from them.\" Black's Law Dictionary 781 (7th ed. 1999).</p>\n<p>[5]  In <i>Batson,</i> we spoke of the methods by which prima facie cases could be proved in permissive terms. A defendant may satisfy his prima facie burden, we said, \"by relying solely on the facts concerning [the selection of the venire] <i>in his case.</i>\" 476 U. S., at 95 (emphasis in original). We declined to require proof of a pattern or practice because \"`[a] single invidiously discriminatory governmental act' is not `immunized by the absence of such discrimination in the making of other comparable decisions.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Arlington Heights</i> v. <i>Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.,</i> 429 U. S. 252, 266, n. 14 (1977)).</p>\n<p>[6]  In the unlikely hypothetical in which the prosecutor declines to respond to a trial judge's inquiry regarding his justification for making a strike, the evidence before the judge would consist not only of the original facts from which the prima facie case was established, but also the prosecutor's refusal to justify his strike in light of the court's request. Such a refusal would provide additional support for the inference of discrimination raised by a defendant's prima facie case. Cf. <i>United States ex rel. Vajtauer</i> v. <i>Commissioner of Immigration,</i> 273 U. S. 103, 111 (1927).</p>\n<p>[7]  This explanation comports with our interpretation of the burden-shifting framework in cases arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Furnco Constr. Corp.</i> v. <i>Waters,</i> 438 U. S. 567, 577 (1978) (noting that the <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp.</i> v. <i>Green,</i> 411 U. S. 792 (1973), framework \"is merely a sensible, orderly way to evaluate the evidence in light of common experience as it bears on the critical question of discrimination\"); see also <i>St. Mary's Honor Center</i> v. <i>Hicks,</i> 509 U. S. 502, 509-510, and n. 3 (1993) (holding that determinations at steps one and two of the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework \"can involve no credibility assessment\" because \"the burden-of-production determination necessarily <i>precedes</i> the credibility-assessment stage,\" and that the burden-shifting framework triggered by a defendant's prima face case is essentially just \"a means of `arranging the presentation of evidence'\" (quoting <i>Watson</i> v. <i>Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust,</i> 487 U. S. 977, 986 (1988))).</p>\n\n</div>",
