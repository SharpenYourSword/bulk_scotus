In adjudicating Stumpf's petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted him relief on two grounds: that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and that his conviction and sentence could not stand because the State, in a later trial of Stumpf's accomplice, pursued a theory of the case inconsistent with the theory it had advanced <span class=\"star-pagination\">*178</span> in Stumpf's case. We granted certiorari to review both holdings. 543 U. S. 1042 (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>On May 14, 1984, Stumpf and two other men, Clyde Daniel Wesley and Norman Leroy Edmonds, were traveling in Edmonds' car along Interstate 70 through Guernsey County, Ohio. Needing money for gas, the men stopped the car along the highway. While Edmonds waited in the car, Stumpf and Wesley walked to the home of Norman and Mary Jane Stout, about 100 yards away. Stumpf and Wesley, each concealing a gun, talked their way into the home by telling the Stouts they needed to use the phone. Their real object, however, was robbery: Once inside, Stumpf held the Stouts at gunpoint, while Wesley ransacked the house. When Mr. Stout moved toward Stumpf, Stumpf shot him twice in the head, causing Mr. Stout to black out. After he regained consciousness, Mr. Stout heard two male voices coming from another room, and then four gunshots \u0097 the shots that killed his wife. Edmonds was arrested shortly afterward, and his statements led the police to issue arrest warrants for Stumpf and Wesley. Stumpf, who surrendered to the police, at first denied any knowledge of the crimes. After he was told that Mr. Stout had survived, however, Stumpf admitted to participating in the robbery and to shooting Mr. Stumpf. But he claimed not to have shot Mrs. Stout, and he has maintained that position ever since.</p>\n<p>The proceedings against Stumpf occurred while Wesley, who had been arrested in Texas, was still resisting extradition to Ohio. Stumpf was indicted for aggravated murder, attempted aggravated murder, aggravated robbery, and two counts of grand theft. With respect to the aggravated murder charge, the indictment listed four statutory \"specifications\" \u0097 three of them aggravating circumstances making Stumpf eligible for the death penalty. See App. 117-118; <span class=\"star-pagination\">*179</span> Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 2929.03 (Anderson 1982).<sup>[*]</sup> The case was assigned to a three-judge panel in the Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p>Rather than proceed to trial, however, Stumpf and the State worked out a plea agreement: Stumpf would plead guilty to aggravated murder and attempted aggravated murder, and the State would drop most of the other charges; with respect to the aggravated murder charge, Stumpf would plead guilty to one of the three capital specifications, with the State dropping the other two. The plea was accepted after a colloquy with the presiding judge, and after a hearing in which the panel satisfied itself as to the factual basis for the plea.</p>\n<p>Because the capital specification to which Stumpf pleaded guilty left him eligible for the death penalty, a contested penalty hearing was held before the same three-judge panel. Stumpf's mitigation case was based in part on his difficult childhood, limited education, dependable work history, youth, and lack of prior serious offenses. Stumpf's principal argument, however, was that he had participated in the plot only at the urging and under the influence of Wesley, that it was Wesley who had fired the fatal shots at Mrs. Stout, and that Stumpf's assertedly minor role in the murder counseled against the death sentence. See \u00a7 2929.04(B)(6) (directing the sentencer to consider as a potential mitigating circumstance, \"[i]f the offender was a participant in the offense but not the principal offender, the degree of the offender's participation in the offense\"). The State, on the other hand, argued that Stumpf had indeed shot Mrs. Stout. Still, while the prosecutor claimed Stumpf's allegedly primary role in the shooting as a special reason to reject Stumpf's mitigation argument, the prosecutor also noted that Ohio law did not restrict the death penalty to those who commit murder by their own hands \u0097 an accomplice to murder could also receive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*180</span> the death penalty, so long as he acted with the specific intent to cause death. As a result, the State argued, Stumpf deserved death even if he had not personally shot Mrs. Stout, because the circumstances of the robbery provided a basis from which to infer Stumpf's intent to cause death. The three-judge panel, agreeing with the State's first contention, specifically found that Stumpf \"was the principal offender\" in the aggravated murder of Mrs. Stout. App. 196. Determining that the aggravating factors in Stumpf's case outweighed any mitigating factors, the panel sentenced Stumpf to death.</p>\n<p>Afterward, Wesley was successfully extradited to Ohio to stand trial. His case was tried to a jury, before the same judge who had presided over the panel overseeing Stumpf's proceedings, and with the same prosecutor. This time, however, the prosecutor had new evidence: James Eastman, Wesley's cellmate after his extradition, testified that <i>Wesley</i> had admitted to firing the shots that killed Mrs. Stout. The prosecutor introduced Eastman's testimony in Wesley's trial, and in his closing argument he argued for Eastman's credibility and lack of motive to lie. The prosecutor claimed that Eastman's testimony, combined with certain circumstantial evidence and with the implausibility of Wesley's own account of events, proved that Wesley was the principal offender in Mrs. Stout's murder \u0097 and that Wesley therefore deserved to be put to death. One way Wesley countered this argument was by noting that the prosecutor had taken a contrary position in Stumpf's trial, and that Stumpf had already been sentenced to death for the crime. Wesley also took the stand in his own defense, and testified that Stumpf had shot Mrs. Stout. In the end, the jury sentenced Wesley to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after 20 years.</p>\n<p>After the Wesley trial, Stumpf, whose direct appeal was still pending in the Ohio Court of Appeals, returned to the Court of Common Pleas with a motion to withdraw his guilty plea or vacate his death sentence. Stumpf argued that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*181</span> Eastman's testimony, and the prosecution's endorsement of that testimony in Wesley's trial, cast doubt upon Stumpf's conviction and sentence. The State (represented again by the same prosecutor who had tried both Wesley's case and Stumpf's original case) disagreed. According to the prosecutor, the court's first task was to decide whether the Eastman testimony was sufficient to alter the court's prior determination that Stumpf had been the shooter. <i>Id.,</i> at 210. Contrary to the argument he had presented in the Wesley trial, however, the prosecutor now noted that Eastman's testimony was belied by certain other evidence (ballistics evidence and Wesley's testimony in his own defense) confirming Stumpf to have been the primary shooter. In the alternative, the State noted as it had before that an aider-and-abettor theory might allow the death sentence to be imposed against Stumpf even if he had not shot Mrs. Stout.</p>\n<p>Although one judge speculated during oral argument that the court's earlier conclusion about Stumpf's principal role in the killing \"may very well have had an effect upon\" the prior sentencing determination, <i>ibid.,</i> the Court of Common Pleas denied Stumpf's motion in a brief summary order without explanation. That order was appealed together with the original judgment in Stumpf's case, and the Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed, as did the Ohio Supreme Court. <i>State</i> v. <i>Stumpf,</i> 32 Ohio St. 3d 95, 512 N. E. 2d 598 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U. S. 1079 (1988).</p>\n<p>After a subsequent request for state postconviction relief was denied by the state courts, Stumpf filed this federal habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in November 1995. The District Court denied Stumpf relief, but granted permission to appeal on four claims, including the two at issue here. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, concluding that habeas relief was warranted on \"either or both\" of \"two alternative grounds.\" <i>Stumpf</i> v. <i>Mitchell,</i> 367 F. 3d 594, 596 (2004). First, the court determined that Stumpf's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*182</span> guilty plea was invalid because it had not been entered knowingly and intelligently. More precisely, the court concluded that Stumpf had pleaded guilty to aggravated murder without understanding that specific intent to cause death was a necessary element of the charge under Ohio law. See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a72903.01(B) and (D). Noting that Stumpf had all along denied shooting Mrs. Stout, and considering those denials inconsistent with an informed choice to plead guilty to aggravated murder, the Court of Appeals concluded that Stumpf must have entered his plea out of ignorance. Second, the court concluded that \"Stumpf's due process rights were violated by the state's deliberate action in securing convictions of both Stumpf and Wesley for the same crime, using inconsistent theories.\" 367 F. 3d, at 596. This violation, the court held, required setting aside \"both Stumpf's plea and his sentence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 616. One member of the panel dissented.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Because Stumpf filed his habeas petition before enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), we review his claims under the standards of the pre-AEDPA habeas statute. See <i>Lindh</i> v. <i>Murphy,</i> 521 U. S. 320 (1997). Moreover, because petitioner has not argued that Stumpf's habeas claims were barred as requiring announcement of a new rule, we do not apply the rule of <i>Teague</i> v. <i>Lane,</i> 489 U. S. 288 (1989), to this case. See <i>Schiro</i> v. <i>Farley,</i> 510 U. S. 222, 229 (1994); <i>Godinez</i> v. <i>Moran,</i> 509 U. S. 389, 397, n. 8 (1993).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals concluded that Stumpf's plea of guilty to aggravated murder was invalid because he was not aware of the specific intent element of the charge\u0097a determination we find unsupportable.</p>\n<p>Stumpf's guilty plea would indeed be invalid if he had not been aware of the nature of the charges against him, including <span class=\"star-pagination\">*183</span> the elements of the aggravated murder charge to which he pleaded guilty. A guilty plea operates as a waiver of important rights, and is valid only if done voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently, \"with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.\" <i>Brady</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 397 U. S. 742, 748 (1970). Where a defendant pleads guilty to a crime without having been informed of the crime's elements, this standard is not met and the plea is invalid. <i>Henderson</i> v. <i>Morgan,</i> 426 U. S. 637 (1976).</p>\n<p>But the Court of Appeals erred in finding that Stumpf had not been properly informed before pleading guilty. In Stumpf's plea hearing, his attorneys represented on the record that they had explained to their client the elements of the aggravated murder charge; Stumpf himself then confirmed that this representation was true. See App. 135, 137-138. While the court taking a defendant's plea is responsible for ensuring \"a record adequate for any review that may be later sought,\" <i>Boykin</i> v. <i>Alabama,</i> 395 U. S. 238, 244 (1969) (footnote omitted), we have never held that the judge must himself explain the elements of each charge to the defendant on the record. Rather, the constitutional prerequisites of a valid plea may be satisfied where the record accurately reflects that the nature of the charge and the elements of the crime were explained to the defendant by his own, competent counsel. Cf. <i>Henderson, supra,</i> at 647 (granting relief to a defendant unaware of the elements of his crime, but distinguishing that case from others where \"the record contains either an explanation of the charge by the trial judge, or at least a representation by defense counsel that the nature of the offense has been explained to the accused\"). Where a defendant is represented by competent counsel, the court usually may rely on that counsel's assurance that the defendant has been properly informed of the nature and elements of the charge to which he is pleading guilty.</p>\n<p>Seeking to counter this natural inference, Stumpf argues, in essence, that his choice to plead guilty to the aggravated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*184</span> murder charge was so inconsistent with his denial of having shot the victim that he could only have pleaded guilty out of ignorance of the charge's specific intent requirement. But Stumpf's asserted inconsistency is illusory. The aggravated murder charge's intent element did not require any showing that Stumpf had himself shot Mrs. Stout. Rather, Ohio law considers aiders and abettors equally in violation of the aggravated murder statute, so long as the aiding and abetting is done with the specific intent to cause death. See <i>In re Washington,</i> 81 Ohio St. 3d 337, 691 N. E. 2d 285 (1998); <i>State</i> v. <i>Scott,</i> 61 Ohio St. 2d 155, 165, 400 N. E. 2d 375, 382 (1980). As a result, Stumpf's steadfast assertion that he had not shot Mrs. Stout would not necessarily have precluded him from admitting his specific intent under the statute.</p>\n<p>That is particularly so given the other evidence in this case. Stumpf and Wesley had gone to the Stouts' home together, carrying guns and intending to commit armed robbery. Stumpf, by his own admission, shot <i>Mr.</i> Stout in the head at close range. Taken together, these facts could show that Wesley and Stumpf had together agreed to kill both of the Stouts in order to leave no witnesses to the crime. And that, in turn, could make both men guilty of aggravated murder regardless of who actually killed Mrs. Stout. See <i>ibid.,</i></p>\n<p>Stumpf also points to aspects of the plea hearing transcript which he says show that both he and his attorneys were confused about the relevance and timing of defenses Stumpf and his attorneys had planned to make. First, at one point during the hearing, the presiding judge stated that by pleading guilty Stumpf would waive his trial rights and his right to testify in his own behalf. Stumpf's attorney answered that Stumpf \"was going to respond but we have informed him that there is, after the plea, a hearing or trial relative to the underlying facts so that he is of the belief that there will be [a] presentation of evidence.\" App. 140. The presiding judge responded that \"[o]f course in the sentencing portion of this trial you do have those rights to speak in your own <span class=\"star-pagination\">*185</span> behalf [and] to present evidence and testimony on your own behalf.\" <i>Ibid.</i> A few moments later, there was another exchange along similar lines, after the judge asked Stumpf whether he was \"in fact guilty of\" the aggravated murder charge and its capital specification:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... Your Honor, the defendant has asked me to explain his answer. His answer is yes. He will recite that with obviously his understanding of his right to present evidence at a later time relative to his conduct, but he'll respond to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"JUDGE HENDERSON: At no time am I implying that the defendant will not have the right to present evidence in [the] mitigation hearing.... And I'm going to ask that the defendant, himself, respond to the question that I asked with that understanding that he has the right to present evidence in mitigation. I'm going to ask the defendant if he is in fact guilty of the charge set forth in Count one, including specification one... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 142.</blockquote>\n<p>Reviewing this exchange, the Court of Appeals concluded that Stumpf \"obviously ... was reiterating his desire to challenge the [S]tate's account of his actions\"\u0097that is, to show that he did not intend to kill Mrs. Stout. 367 F. 3d, at 607. But the desire to contest the State's version of events would not necessarily entail the desire to contest the aggravated murder charge or any of its elements. Rather, Stumpf's desire to put on evidence \"relative to the underlying facts\" and \"relative to his conduct\" could equally have meant that Stumpf was eager to make his mitigation case\u0097an interpretation bolstered by the attorney's and Stumpf's approving answers after the presiding judge confirmed that the defense could put on evidence \"in mitigation\" and in \"the sentencing\" phase. While Stumpf's mitigation case was premised on the argument that Stumpf had not shot Mrs. Stout, that was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*186</span> fully consistent with his plea of guilty to aggravated murder. See <i>supra,</i> at 183-184.</p>\n<p>Finally, Stumpf, like the Court of Appeals, relies on the perception that he obtained a bad bargain by his plea\u0097that the State's dropping several nonmurder charges and two of the three capital murder specifications was a bad tradeoff for Stumpf's guilty plea. But a plea's validity may not be collaterally attacked merely because the defendant made what turned out, in retrospect, to be a poor deal. See <i>Brady,</i> 397 U. S., at 757; <i>Mabry</i> v. <i>Johnson,</i> 467 U. S. 504, 508 (1984). Rather, the shortcomings of the deal Stumpf obtained cast doubt on the validity of his plea only if they show either that he made the unfavorable plea on the constitutionally defective advice of counsel, see <i>Tollett</i> v. <i>Henderson,</i> 411 U. S. 258, 267 (1973), or that he could not have understood the terms of the bargain he and Ohio agreed to. Though Stumpf did bring an independent claim asserting ineffective assistance of counsel, that claim is not before us in this case. And in evaluating the validity of Stumpf's plea, we are reluctant to accord much weight to his <i>post hoc</i> reevaluation of the wisdom of the bargain. Stumpf pleaded guilty knowing that the State had copious evidence against him, including the testimony of Mr. Stout; the plea eliminated two of the three capital specifications the State could rely on in seeking the death penalty; and the plea allowed Stumpf to assert his acceptance of responsibility as an argument in mitigation. Under these circumstances, the plea may well have been a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent reaction to a litigation situation that was difficult, to say the least. The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that Stumpf was uninformed about the nature of the charge he pleaded guilty to, and we reverse that portion of the judgment below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals was also wrong to hold that prosecutorial inconsistencies between the Stumpf and Wesley cases <span class=\"star-pagination\">*187</span> required voiding Stumpf's guilty plea. Stumpf's assertions of inconsistency relate entirely to the prosecutor's arguments about which of the two men, Wesley or Stumpf, shot Mrs. Stout. For the reasons given above, see <i>supra,</i> at 183-184, the precise identity of the triggerman was immaterial to Stumpf's conviction for aggravated murder. Moreover, Stumpf has never provided an explanation of how the prosecution's postplea use of inconsistent arguments could have affected the knowing, voluntary, and intelligent nature of his plea.</p>\n<p>The prosecutor's use of allegedly inconsistent theories may have a more direct effect on Stumpf's sentence, however, for it is at least arguable that the sentencing panel's conclusion about Stumpf's principal role in the offense was material to its sentencing determination. The opinion below leaves some ambiguity as to the overlap between how the lower court resolved Stumpf's due process challenge to his conviction, and how it resolved Stumpf's challenge to his sentence. It is not clear whether the Court of Appeals would have concluded that Stumpf was entitled to resentencing had the court not also considered the conviction invalid. Likewise, the parties' briefing to this Court, and the question on which we granted certiorari, largely focused on the lower court's determination about Stumpf's conviction. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Pet. for Cert. ii (requesting review of Stumpf's <i>conviction,</i> not sentence); Reply Brief for Petitioner 3 (challenge to Court of Appeals' decision is focused on issue of conviction); Brief for Respondent 15, n. 3 (\"arguments regarding Stumpf's death sentence are not before this Court\"). In these circumstances, it would be premature for this Court to resolve the merits of Stumpf's sentencing claim, and we therefore express no opinion on whether the prosecutor's actions amounted to a due process violation, or whether any such violation would have been prejudicial. The Court of Appeals should have the opportunity to consider, in the first instance, the question of how Eastman's testimony and the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*188</span> prosecutor's conduct in the Stumpf and Wesley cases relate to Stumpf's death sentence in particular. Accordingly, we vacate the portion of the judgment below relating to Stumpf's prosecutorial inconsistency claim, and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE SOUTER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the opinion of the Court and add this word to explain the issue that I understand we are remanding for further consideration. As the Court notes in its opinion, although respondent John Stumpf challenged both his conviction and his death sentence, his attack on the sentence was not always distinct from the issue raised about the conviction.</p>\n<p>I understand Stumpf to claim that it violates the basic due process standard, barring fundamentally unfair procedure, to allow his death sentence to stand in the aftermath of three positions taken by the State: (1) at Stumpf's sentencing hearing; (2) at the trial of Stumpf's codefendant, Clyde Wesley; and (3) in response to Stumpf's motion to withdraw his guilty plea in light of the State's position at the Wesley trial. At the hearing on Stumpf's sentence, the State argued that he was the triggerman, and it urged consideration of that fact as a reason to impose a death sentence. App. 186, 188-189. The trial court found that Stumpf had pulled the trigger and did sentence him to death, though it did not state that finding Stumpf to be the shooter was dispositive in determining the sentence. App. to Pet. for Cert. 219a. After the sentencing proceeding was over, the State tried the codefendant, Wesley, and on the basis of testimony from a new witness argued that Wesley was in fact the triggerman, App. 282, and should be sentenced to death. The new witness was apparently unconvincing to the jury, which in any event was informed that Stumpf had already been sentenced to death for the crime; the jury rejected the specification that named Wesley as the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*189</span> triggerman, and it recommended a sentence of life, not death. Stumpf then challenged his death sentence (along with his conviction) on the basis of the prosecution's position in the Wesley case. In response, the State did not repudiate the position it had taken in the codefendant's case, or explain that it had made a mistake there. Instead, it merely dismissed the testimony of the witness it had vouched for at Wesley's trial, <i>id.,</i> at 125, and maintained that Stumpf's death sentence should stand for some or all of the reasons it originally argued for its imposition. At the end of the day, the State was on record as maintaining that Stumpf and Wesley should both be executed on the ground that each was the triggerman, when it was undisputed that only one of them could have been.</p>\n<p>Stumpf's claim as I understand it is not a challenge to the evidentiary basis for arguing for the death penalty in either case; nor is it a claim that the prosecution deliberately deceived or attempted to deceive either trial court, as in <i>Mooney</i> v. <i>Holohan,</i> 294 U. S. 103 (1935) <i>(per curiam)</i>; nor does it implicate the rule that inconsistent jury verdicts may be enforced, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Powell,</i> 469 U. S. 57 (1984); <i>Dunn</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 284 U. S. 390 (1932). As I see it, Stumpf's argument is simply that a death sentence may not be allowed to stand when it was imposed in response to a factual claim that the State necessarily contradicted in subsequently arguing for a death sentence in the case of a codefendant. Stumpf's position was anticipated by JUSTICE STEVENS's observation 10 years ago that \"serious questions are raised when the sovereign itself takes inconsistent positions in two separate criminal proceedings against two of its citizens,\" and that \"[t]he heightened need for reliability in capital cases only underscores the gravity of those questions ....\" <i>Jacobs</i> v. <i>Scott,</i> 513 U. S. 1067, 1070 (1995) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). JUSTICE STEVENS's statement in turn echoed the more general one expressed by Justice Sutherland in <i>Berger</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*190</span> 295 U. S. 78, 88 (1935), that the State's interest in winning some point in a given case is transcended by its interest \"that justice shall be done.\" Ultimately, Stumpf's argument appears to be that sustaining a death sentence in circumstances like those here results in a sentencing system that invites the death penalty \"to be ... wantonly and . . . freakishly imposed.\" <i>Lewis</i> v. <i>Jeffers,</i> 497 U. S. 764, 774 (1990) (quoting <i>Gregg</i> v. <i>Georgia,</i> 428 U. S. 153, 188 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>If a due process violation is found in the State's maintenance of such inconsistent positions, there will be remedial questions. May the death sentence stand if the State declines to repudiate its inconsistent position in the codefendant's case? Would it be sufficient simply to reexamine the original sentence and if so, which party should have the burden of persuasion? If more would be required, would a <i>de novo</i> sentencing hearing suffice?</p>\n<p>JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the Court's opinion. As the Court notes, the State has not argued that <i>Teague</i> v. <i>Lane,</i> 489 U. S. 288 (1989), forecloses Stumpf's claim that the prosecution's presentation of inconsistent theories violated his right to due process. <i>Ante,</i> at 182. With certain narrow exceptions, <i>Teague</i> precludes federal courts from granting habeas petitioners relief on the basis of \"new\" rules of constitutional law established after their convictions become final. 489 U. S., at 310 (plurality opinion). This Court has never hinted, much less held, that the Due Process Clause prevents a State from prosecuting defendants based on inconsistent theories. Moreover, it is \"[a] threshold question in every habeas case . . . whether the court is obligated to apply the <i>Teague</i> rule to the defendant's claim,\" and \"if the State does argue <span class=\"star-pagination\">*191</span> that the defendant seeks the benefit of a new rule of constitutional law, the court <i>must</i> apply <i>Teague</i> before considering the merits of the claim.\" <i>Horn</i> v. <i>Banks,</i> 536 U. S. 266, 271 (2002) <i>(per curiam)</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). The State also has not argued that Stumpf procedurally defaulted his due process claim, even though it appears that Stumpf never presented this argument to the Ohio courts. Stumpf did not even raise the inconsistent-theories claim in his first federal habeas filings. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 134a-140a. Instead, the District Court raised the issue for Stumpf <i>sua sponte,</i> and ordered supplemental briefing on the point. See App. 97-98. The Court's opinion does not preclude the State from advancing either of these procedural defenses on remand in support of Stumpf's death sentence.</p>\n<p>Moreover, I agree with the Court that \"Stumpf has never provided an explanation of how the prosecution's postplea use of inconsistent arguments could have affected the knowing, voluntary, and intelligent nature of his plea.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 187. Similar reasoning applies to Stumpf's sentence. Stumpf equally has never explained how the prosecution's use of postsentence inconsistent arguments\u0097which were based on evidence unavailable until after Stumpf was sentenced\u0097could have affected the reliability or procedural fairness of his death sentence. At most, the evidence and purportedly inconsistent theory presented at Wesley's trial would constitute newly discovered evidence casting doubt on the reliability of Stumpf's death sentence, a sort of claim that our precedents and this Nation's traditions have long foreclosed, see <i>Herrera</i> v. <i>Collins,</i> 506 U.

STUMPF\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 04\u2013637.      Argued April 19, 2005\u2014Decided June 13, 2005\nRespondent Stumpf and his accomplice Wesley committed an armed\n  robbery that left Mr. Stout wounded and Mrs. Stout dead. Stumpf\n  admitted shooting Mr. Stout but has always denied killing Mrs.\n  Stout. In Ohio state court proceedings, Stumpf pleaded guilty to,\n  among other things, aggravated murder and one of three capital\n  murder specifications charged in his indictment. This left Stumpf\n  eligible for the death penalty. In a contested penalty hearing before a\n  three-judge panel, Stumpf \u2019s principal mitigation arguments were\n  that he had participated in the robbery at Wesley\u2019s urging, that\n  Wesley had killed Mrs. Stout, and that Stumpf \u2019s minor role in the\n  murder counseled against the death sentence. The State, however,\n  claimed that Stumpf had shot Mrs. Stout, and that he therefore was\n  the principal offender in her murder. In the alternative, the State\n  noted that even an accomplice can be sentenced to death under Ohio\n  law if he acted with the specific intent to cause death, and the State\n  argued that such intent could be inferred from the circumstances of\n  the robbery regardless of who actually shot Mrs. Stout. The panel\n  concluded that Stumpf was the principal offender and sentenced him\n  to death. At Wesley\u2019s subsequent jury trial, however, the State pre-\n  sented evidence that Wesley had admitted to shooting Mrs. Stout.\n  But Wesley argued that the prosecutor had taken a contrary position\n  in Stumpf \u2019s trial, and Wesley was sentenced to life in prison with the\n  possibility of parole. After Wesley\u2019s trial, Stumpf moved to withdraw\n  his own plea or vacate his death sentence, arguing that the evidence\n  endorsed by the State in Wesley\u2019s trial cast doubt on Stumpf \u2019s convic-\n  tion and sentence. This time, however, the prosecutor emphasized\n  other evidence confirming Stumpf as the shooter and again raised, in\n  the alternative, the aider-and-abettor theory. The court denied\n2                       BRADSHAW v. STUMPF\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    Stumpf \u2019s motion, and Ohio\u2019s appellate courts affirmed. Subse-\n    quently, the Federal District Court denied Stumpf habeas relief, but\n    the Sixth Circuit reversed on two grounds. First, the Sixth Circuit\n    found that Stumpf had not understood that specific intent to cause\n    death was a necessary element of the aggravated murder charge, and\n    that his guilty plea therefore had not been knowing, voluntary, and\n    intelligent. Second, the court found that the conviction and sentence\n    could not stand because the State had secured convictions of both\n    Stumpf and Wesley for the same crime, using inconsistent theories.\nHeld:\n    1. The Sixth Circuit erred in concluding that Stumpf was unin-\n formed of the aggravated murder charge\u2019s specific intent element.\n While a guilty plea is invalid if the defendant has not been informed\n of the crime\u2019s elements, Stumpf \u2019s attorneys represented at his plea\n hearing that they had explained the elements to their client, and\n Stumpf confirmed that the representation was true. This Court has\n never held that the judge must himself explain a crime\u2019s elements to\n the defendant. Rather, constitutional requirements may be satisfied\n where the record accurately reflects that the charge\u2019s nature and the\n crime\u2019s elements were explained to the defendant by his own, compe-\n tent counsel. Stumpf argues that his plea was so inconsistent with\n his denial of having shot Mrs. Stout that he could only have pleaded\n guilty out of ignorance of the aggravated murder charge\u2019s specific in-\n tent element. But that argument fails because Stumpf \u2019s conviction\n did not require a showing that Stumpf had shot Mrs. Stout. Ohio law\n also considers aiders and abettors who act with specific intent to\n cause death liable for aggravated murder. Stumpf and Wesley en-\n tered the Stout home with guns, intending to commit armed robbery,\n and Stumpf admitted shooting Mr. Stout. Taken together, these facts\n could show that the two men had agreed to kill both Stouts, which in\n turn could make both men guilty of aggravated murder regardless of\n who shot Mrs. Stout. Stumpf \u2019s claim that he and his attorneys were\n confused about the relevance and timing of defenses that they\n planned to make is not supported by the record. Finally, the plea\u2019s\n validity may not be collaterally attacked on the ground that Stumpf\n made what he now claims was a bad deal. Pp. 6\u201310.\n    2. The Sixth Circuit was also wrong to hold that prosecutorial in-\n consistencies between the Stumpf and Wesley cases required voiding\n Stumpf \u2019s guilty plea. The precise identity of the triggerman was im-\n material to Stumpf \u2019s aggravated murder conviction, and Stumpf has\n never explained how the prosecution\u2019s postplea use of inconsistent\n arguments could have affected the knowing, voluntary, and intelli-\n gent nature of his plea.

The opinion below leaves some ambi-\n  guity as to the overlap between how the lower court resolved\n  Stumpf \u2019s due process challenge to his conviction and how it resolved\n  his challenge to his sentence. It is not clear whether the Court of Ap-\n  peals would have found Stumpf entitled to resentencing had it not\n  also considered the conviction invalid. Likewise, the parties\u2019 briefing\n  here, and the question on which this Court granted certiorari, largely\n  focused on the conviction. In these circumstances, it would be prema-\n  ture for this Court to resolve the merits of Stumpf \u2019s sentencing claim\n  before giving the Sixth Circuit the opportunity to consider in the first\n  instance the question of how the prosecutor\u2019s conduct in the Stumpf\n  and Wesley cases related to Stumpf \u2019s death sentence in particular.\n  Pp. 11\u201312.\n367 F. 3d 594, reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.\n\n   O\u2019CONNOR, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

In adjudicating Stumpf \u2019s petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus, the United States Court of Appeals for the\nSixth Circuit granted him relief on two grounds: that his\nguilty plea was not knowing, voluntary, and intelligent,\nand that his conviction and sentence could not stand\nbecause the State, in a later trial of Stumpf \u2019s accomplice,\npursued a theory of the case inconsistent with the theory\nit had advanced in Stumpf \u2019s case. We granted certiorari\nto review both holdings. 543 U. S. ___ (2005).\n                            I\n  On May 14, 1984, Stumpf and two other men, Clyde\nDaniel Wesley and Norman Leroy Edmonds, were travel-\ning in Edmonds\u2019 car along Interstate 70 through Guernsey\nCounty, Ohio. Needing money for gas, the men stopped\nthe car along the highway. While Edmonds waited in the\ncar, Stumpf and Wesley walked to the home of Norman\nand Mary Jane Stout, about 100 yards away. Stumpf and\nWesley, each concealing a gun, talked their way into the\n2                      BRADSHAW v. STUMPF\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhome by telling the Stouts they needed to use the phone.\nTheir real object, however, was robbery: Once inside,\nStumpf held the Stouts at gunpoint, while Wesley ran-\nsacked the house. When Mr. Stout moved toward Stumpf,\nStumpf shot him twice in the head, causing Mr. Stout to\nblack out. After he regained consciousness, Mr. Stout\nheard two male voices coming from another room, and\nthen four gunshots\u2014the shots that killed his wife. Ed-\nmonds was arrested shortly afterward, and his statements\nled the police to issue arrest warrants for Stumpf and\nWesley. Stumpf, who surrendered to the police, at first\ndenied any knowledge of the crimes. After he was told\nthat Mr. Stout had survived, however, Stumpf admitted to\nparticipating in the robbery and to shooting Mr. Stumpf.\nBut he claimed not to have shot Mrs. Stout, and he has\nmaintained that position ever since.\n   The proceedings against Stumpf occurred while Wesley,\nwho had been arrested in Texas, was still resisting extra-\ndition to Ohio. Stumpf was indicted for aggravated mur-\nder, attempted aggravated murder, aggravated robbery,\nand two counts of grand theft. With respect to the aggra-\nvated murder charge, the indictment listed four statutory\n\u201cspecifications\u201d\u2014three of them aggravating circumstances\nmaking Stumpf eligible for the death penalty. See App.\n117\u2013118; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a72929.03 (Anderson 1982).*\nThe case was assigned to a three-judge panel in the Court\nof Common Pleas.\n   Rather than proceed to trial, however, Stumpf and the\nState worked out a plea agreement: Stumpf would plead\nguilty to aggravated murder and attempted aggravated\nmurder, and the State would drop most of the other\ncharges; with respect to the aggravated murder charge,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * Unless otherwise noted, all citations to Ohio statutes refer to the\nversions of those statutes in effect in 1984, at the time of the crime and\ntrial.\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStumpf would plead guilty to one of the three capital\nspecifications, with the State dropping the other two. The\nplea was accepted after a colloquy with the presiding\njudge, and after a hearing in which the panel satisfied\nitself as to the factual basis for the plea.\n   Because the capital specification to which Stumpf\npleaded guilty left him eligible for the death penalty, a\ncontested penalty hearing was held before the same three-\njudge panel. Stumpf \u2019s mitigation case was based in part\non his difficult childhood, limited education, dependable\nwork history, youth, and lack of prior serious offenses.\nStumpf \u2019s principal argument, however, was that he had\nparticipated in the plot only at the urging and under the\ninfluence of Wesley, that it was Wesley who had fired the\nfatal shots at Mrs. Stout, and that Stumpf \u2019s assertedly\nminor role in the murder counseled against the death\nsentence. See \u00a72929.04(B)(6) (directing the sentencer to\nconsider as a potential mitigating circumstance, \u201c[i]f the\noffender was a participant in the offense but not the prin-\ncipal offender, the degree of the offender\u2019s participation in\nthe offense\u201d). The State, on the other hand, argued that\nStumpf had indeed shot Mrs. Stout. Still, while the prose-\ncutor claimed Stumpf \u2019s allegedly primary role in the\nshooting as a special reason to reject Stumpf \u2019s mitigation\nargument, the prosecutor also noted that Ohio law did not\nrestrict the death penalty to those who commit murder by\ntheir own hands\u2014an accomplice to murder could also\nreceive the death penalty, so long as he acted with the\nspecific intent to cause death. As a result, the State ar-\ngued, Stumpf deserved death even if he had not personally\nshot Mrs. Stout, because the circumstances of the robbery\nprovided a basis from which to infer Stumpf\u2019s intent to\ncause death. The three-judge panel, agreeing with the\nState\u2019s first contention, specifically found that Stumpf\n\u201cwas the principal offender\u201d in the aggravated murder of\nMrs. Stout. App. 196. Determining that the aggravating\n4                  BRADSHAW v. STUMPF\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfactors in Stumpf \u2019s case outweighed any mitigating fac-\ntors, the panel sentenced Stumpf to death.\n  Afterward, Wesley was successfully extradited to Ohio\nto stand trial. His case was tried to a jury, before the\nsame judge who had presided over the panel overseeing\nStumpf \u2019s proceedings, and with the same prosecutor. This\ntime, however, the prosecutor had new evidence: James\nEastman, Wesley\u2019s cellmate after his extradition, testified\nthat Wesley had admitted to firing the shots that killed\nMrs. Stout. The prosecutor introduced Eastman\u2019s testi-\nmony in Wesley\u2019s trial, and in his closing argument he\nargued for Wesley\u2019s credibility and lack of motive to lie.\nThe prosecutor claimed that Eastman\u2019s testimony, com-\nbined with certain circumstantial evidence and with the\nimplausibility of Wesley\u2019s own account of events, proved\nthat Wesley was the principal offender in Mrs. Stout\u2019s\nmurder\u2014and that Wesley therefore deserved to be put to\ndeath. One way Wesley countered this argument was by\nnoting that the prosecutor had taken a contrary position\nin Stumpf \u2019s trial, and that Stumpf had already been sen-\ntenced to death for the crime. Wesley also took the stand\nin his own defense, and testified that Stumpf had shot\nMrs. Stout. In the end, the jury sentenced Wesley to life\nimprisonment with the possibility of parole after 20 years.\n  After the Wesley trial, Stumpf, whose direct appeal was\nstill pending in the Ohio Court of Appeals, returned to the\nCourt of Common Pleas with a motion to withdraw his\nguilty plea or vacate his death sentence. Stumpf argued\nthat Eastman\u2019s testimony, and the prosecution\u2019s endorse-\nment of that testimony in Wesley\u2019s trial, cast doubt upon\nStumpf \u2019s conviction and sentence. The State (represented\nagain by the same prosecutor who had tried both Wesley\u2019s\ncase and Stumpf \u2019s original case) disagreed. According to\nthe prosecutor, the court\u2019s first task was to decide whether\nthe Eastman testimony was sufficient to alter the court\u2019s\nprior determination that Stumpf had been the shooter.\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 210. Contrary to the argument he had presented in\nthe Wesley trial, however, the prosecutor now noted that\nEastman\u2019s testimony was belied by certain other evidence\n(ballistics evidence and Wesley\u2019s testimony in his own\ndefense) confirming Stumpf to have been the primary\nshooter. In the alternative, the State noted as it had\nbefore that an aider-and-abettor theory might allow the\ndeath sentence to be imposed against Stumpf even if he\nhad not shot Mrs. Stout.\n  Although one judge speculated during oral argument\nthat the court\u2019s earlier conclusion about Stumpf \u2019s princi-\npal role in the killing \u201cmay very well have had an effect\nupon\u201d the prior sentencing determination, ibid., the Court\nof Common Pleas denied Stumpf \u2019s motion in a brief sum-\nmary order without explanation. That order was appealed\ntogether with the original judgment in Stumpf \u2019s case, and\nthe Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed, as did the Ohio Su-\npreme Court. State v. Stumpf, 32 Ohio St. 3d 95, 512\nN. E. 2d 598 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U. S. 1079 (1988).\n  After a subsequent request for state postconviction relief\nwas denied by the state courts, Stumpf filed this federal\nhabeas petition in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of Ohio in November 1995. The District\nCourt denied Stumpf relief, but granted permission to\nappeal on four claims, including the two at issue here.\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit\nreversed, concluding that habeas relief was warranted on\n\u201ceither or both\u201d of \u201ctwo alternative grounds.\u201d Stumpf v.\nMitchell, 367 F. 3d 594, 596 (2004). First, the court de-\ntermined that Stumpf \u2019s guilty plea was invalid because it\nhad not been entered knowingly and intelligently. More\nprecisely, the court concluded that Stumpf had pleaded\nguilty to aggravated murder without understanding that\nspecific intent to cause death was a necessary element of\nthe charge under Ohio law. See Ohio Rev. Code Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a72903.01(B) and (D). Noting that Stumpf had all along\n6                  BRADSHAW v. STUMPF\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndenied shooting Mrs. Stout, and considering those denials\ninconsistent with an informed choice to plead guilty to\naggravated murder, the Court of Appeals concluded that\nStumpf must have entered his plea out of ignorance.\nSecond, the court concluded that \u201cStumpf \u2019s due process\nrights were violated by the state\u2019s deliberate action in\nsecuring convictions of both Stumpf and Wesley for the\nsame crime, using inconsistent theories.\u201d 367 F. 3d, at\n596. This violation, the court held, required setting aside\n\u201cboth Stumpf \u2019s plea and his sentence.\u201d Id., at 616. One\nmember of the panel dissented.\n                              II\n  Because Stumpf filed his habeas petition before enact-\nment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\nof 1996 (AEDPA), we review his claims under the stan-\ndards of the pre-AEDPA habeas statute. See Lindh v.\nMurphy, 521 U. S. 320 (1997). Moreover, because petitioner\nhas not argued that Stumpf \u2019s habeas claims were barred as\nrequiring announcement of a new rule, we do not apply the\nrule of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), to this case.\nSee Schiro v. Farley, 510 U. S. 222, 229 (1994); Godinez v.\nMoran, 509 U. S. 389, 397, n. 8 (1993).\n                              A\n  The Court of Appeals concluded that Stumpf \u2019s plea of\nguilty to aggravated murder was invalid because he was\nnot aware of the specific intent element of the charge\u2014a\ndetermination we find unsupportable.\n  Stumpf \u2019s guilty plea would indeed be invalid if he had\nnot been aware of the nature of the charges against him,\nincluding the elements of the aggravated murder charge to\nwhich he pleaded guilty. A guilty plea operates as a\nwaiver of important rights, and is valid only if done volun-\ntarily, knowingly, and intelligently, \u201cwith sufficient aware-\nness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.\u201d\n                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBrady v. United States, 397 U. S. 742, 748 (1970). Where a\ndefendant pleads guilty to a crime without having been\ninformed of the crime\u2019s elements, this standard is not met\nand the plea is invalid. Henderson v. Morgan, 426 U. S. 637\n(1976).\n   But the Court of Appeals erred in finding that Stumpf had\nnot been properly informed before pleading guilty. In\nStumpf \u2019s plea hearing, his attorneys represented on the\nrecord that they had explained to their client the elements\nof the aggravated murder charge; Stumpf himself then\nconfirmed that this representation was true. See App.\n135, 137\u2013138. While the court taking a defendant\u2019s plea is\nresponsible for ensuring \u201ca record adequate for any review\nthat may be later sought,\u201d Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S.\n238, 244 (1969), we have never held that the judge must\nhimself explain the elements of each charge to the defen-\ndant on the record. Rather, the constitutional prerequi-\nsites of a valid plea may be satisfied where the record\naccurately reflects that the nature of the charge and the\nelements of the crime were explained to the defendant by\nhis own, competent counsel. Cf. Henderson, supra, at 647\n(granting relief to a defendant unaware of the elements of\nhis crime, but distinguishing that case from others where\n\u201cthe record contains either an explanation of the charge by\nthe trial judge, or at least a representation by defense coun-\nsel that the nature of the offense has been explained to the\naccused\u201d). Where a defendant is represented by competent\ncounsel, the court usually may rely on that counsel\u2019s assur-\nance that the defendant has been properly informed of the\nnature and elements of the charge to which he is pleading\nguilty.\n   Seeking to counter this natural inference, Stumpf argues,\nin essence, that his choice to plead guilty to the aggra-\nvated murder charge was so inconsistent with his denial of\nhaving shot the victim that he could only have pleaded\nguilty out of ignorance of the charge\u2019s specific intent re-\n8                  BRADSHAW v. STUMPF\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nquirement. But Stumpf \u2019s asserted inconsistency is illu-\nsory. The aggravated murder charge\u2019s intent element did\nnot require any showing that Stumpf had himself shot\nMrs. Stout. Rather, Ohio law considers aiders and abet-\ntors equally in violation of the aggravated murder statute,\nso long as the aiding and abetting is done with the specific\nintent to cause death. See In re Washington, 81 Ohio St.\n3d 337, 691 N. E. 2d 285 (1998); State v. Scott, 61 Ohio St.\n2d 155, 165, 400 N. E. 2d 375, 382 (1980). As a result,\nStumpf \u2019s steadfast assertion that he had not shot Mrs.\nStout would not necessarily have precluded him from\nadmitting his specific intent under the statute.\n  That is particularly so given the other evidence in this\ncase. Stumpf and Wesley had gone to the Stouts\u2019 home\ntogether, carrying guns and intending to commit armed\nrobbery. Stumpf, by his own admission, shot Mr. Stout in\nthe head at close range. Taken together, these facts could\nshow that Wesley and Stumpf had together agreed to kill\nboth of the Stouts in order to leave no witnesses to the\ncrime. And that, in turn, could make both men guilty of\naggravated murder regardless of who actually killed Mrs.\nStout. See ibid., at 165, 400 N. E. 2d, at 382.\n  Stumpf also points to aspects of the plea hearing tran-\nscript which he says show that both he and his attorneys\nwere confused about the relevance and timing of defenses\nStumpf and his attorneys had planned to make. First, at\none point during the hearing, the presiding judge stated\nthat by pleading guilty Stumpf would waive his trial\nrights and his right to testify in his own behalf. Stumpf \u2019s\nattorney answered that Stumpf \u201cwas going to respond but\nwe have informed him that there is, after the plea, a hear-\ning or trial relative to the underlying facts so that he is of\nthe belief that there will be a presentation of evidence.\u201d\nApp. 140. The presiding judge responded that \u201c[o]f course\nin the sentencing portion of this trial you do have those\nrights to speak in your own behalf [and] to present evi-\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndence and testimony on your own behalf.\u201d Ibid. A few\nmoments later, there was another exchange along similar\nlines, after the judge asked Stumpf whether he was \u201cin\nfact guilty of\u201d the aggravated murder charge and its capi-\ntal specification:\n    \u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: . . . Your Honor, the defen-\n    dant has asked me to explain his answer. His answer\n    is yes. He will recite that with obviously his under-\n    standing of his right to present evidence at a later\n    time relative to his conduct, but he\u2019ll respond to that.\n    \u201cJUDGE HENDERSON: At no time am I implying\n    that the defendant will not have the right to present\n    evidence in [the] mitigation hearing . . . . And I\u2019m go-\n    ing to ask that the defendant, himself, respond to the\n    question that I asked with that understanding that he\n    has the right to present evidence in mitigation. I\u2019m\n    going to ask the defendant if he is in fact guilty of the\n    charge set forth in Count one, including specification\n    one . . . ?\n    \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\u201d Id., at 142.\nReviewing this exchange, the Court of Appeals concluded\nthat Stumpf \u201cobviously . . . was reiterating his desire to\nchallenge the [S]tate\u2019s account of his actions\u201d\u2014that is, to\nshow that he did not intend to kill Mrs. Stout. 367 F. 3d,\nat 607. But the desire to contest the State\u2019s version of\nevents would not necessarily entail the desire to contest\nthe aggravated murder charge or any of its elements.\nRather, Stumpf \u2019s desire to put on evidence \u201crelative to the\nunderlying facts\u201d and \u201crelative to his conduct\u201d could\nequally have meant that Stumpf was eager to make his\nmitigation case\u2014an interpretation bolstered by the attor-\nney\u2019s and Stumpf \u2019s approving answers after the presiding\njudge confirmed that the defense could put on evidence \u201cin\nmitigation\u201d and in \u201cthe sentencing\u201d phase.            While\nStumpf \u2019s mitigation case was premised on the argument\n10                 BRADSHAW v. STUMPF\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat Stumpf had not shot Mrs. Stout, that was fully con-\nsistent with his plea of guilty to aggravated murder. See\nsupra, at 7\u20138.\n   Finally, Stumpf, like the Court of Appeals, relies on the\nperception that he obtained a bad bargain by his plea\u2014\nthat the State\u2019s dropping several non-murder charges and\ntwo of the three capital murder specifications was a bad\ntradeoff for Stumpf \u2019s guilty plea. But a plea\u2019s validity may\nnot be collaterally attacked merely because the defendant\nmade what turned out, in retrospect, to be a poor deal.\nSee Brady, 397 U. S., at 757; Mabry v. Johnson, 467 U. S.\n504, 508 (1984). Rather, the shortcomings of the deal\nStumpf obtained cast doubt on the validity of his plea only\nif they show either that he made the unfavorable plea on\nthe constitutionally defective advice of counsel, see Tollett\nv. Henderson, 411 U. S. 258, 267 (1973), or that he could not\nhave understood the terms of the bargain he and Ohio\nagreed to. Though Stumpf did bring an independent claim\nasserting ineffective assistance of counsel, that claim is\nnot before us in this case. And in evaluating the validity\nof Stumpf \u2019s plea, we are reluctant to accord much weight\nto his post hoc reevaluation of the wisdom of the bargain.\nStumpf pleaded guilty knowing that the State had copious\nevidence against him, including the testimony of Mr.\nStout; the plea eliminated two of the three capital specifi-\ncations the State could rely on in seeking the death pen-\nalty; and the plea allowed Stumpf to assert his acceptance\nof responsibility as an argument in mitigation. Under\nthese circumstances, the plea may well have been a know-\ning, voluntary, and intelligent reaction to a litigation\nsituation that was difficult, to say the least. The Court of\nAppeals erred in concluding that Stumpf was uninformed\nabout the nature of the charge he pleaded guilty to, and\nwe reverse that portion of the judgment below.\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               B\n  The Court of Appeals was also wrong to hold that prose-\ncutorial inconsistencies between the Stumpf and Wesley\ncases required voiding Stumpf \u2019s guilty plea. Stumpf \u2019s\nassertions of inconsistency relate entirely to the prosecu-\ntor\u2019s arguments about which of the two men, Wesley or\nStumpf, shot Mrs. Stout. For the reasons given above, see\nsupra, at 7\u20138, the precise identity of the triggerman was\nimmaterial to Stumpf \u2019s conviction for aggravated murder.\nMoreover, Stumpf has never provided an explanation of\nhow the prosecution\u2019s postplea use of inconsistent argu-\nments could have affected the knowing, voluntary, and\nintelligent nature of his plea.\n  The prosecutor\u2019s use of allegedly inconsistent theories\nmay have a more direct effect on Stumpf \u2019s sentence, how-\never, for it is at least arguable that the sentencing panel\u2019s\nconclusion about Stumpf \u2019s principal role in the offense was\nmaterial to its sentencing determination. The opinion\nbelow leaves some ambiguity as to the overlap between\nhow the lower court resolved Stumpf \u2019s due process chal-\nlenge to his conviction, and how it resolved Stumpf \u2019s\nchallenge to his sentence. It is not clear whether the\nCourt of Appeals would have concluded that Stumpf was\nentitled to resentencing had the court not also considered\nthe conviction invalid. Likewise, the parties\u2019 briefing to\nthis Court, and the question on which we granted certio-\nrari, largely focused on the lower court\u2019s determination\nabout Stumpf \u2019s conviction. See, e.g., Pet. for Cert. ii (re-\nquesting review of Stumpf \u2019s conviction, not sentence);\nReply Brief for Petitioner 3 (challenge to Court of Appeals\u2019\ndecision is focused on issue of conviction); Brief for Re-\nspondent 15, n. 3 (\u201carguments regarding Stumpf \u2019s death\nsentence are not before this Court\u201d). In these circum-\nstances, it would be premature for this Court to resolve\nthe merits of Stumpf \u2019s sentencing claim, and we therefore\nexpress no opinion on whether the prosecutor\u2019s actions\n12                BRADSHAW v. STUMPF\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\namounted to a due process violation, or whether any such\nviolation would have been prejudicial. The Court of Ap-\npeals should have the opportunity to consider, in the first\ninstance, the question of how Eastman\u2019s testimony and\nthe prosecutor\u2019s conduct in the Stumpf and Wesley cases\nrelate to Stumpf \u2019s death sentence in particular. Accord-\ningly, we vacate the portion of the judgment below relat-\ning to Stumpf \u2019s prosecutorial inconsistency claim, and we\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 545 U.

As the Court notes in its opinion,\nalthough respondent John Stumpf challenged both his\nconviction and his death sentence, his attack on the sen-\ntence was not always distinct from the issue raised about\nthe conviction.\n   I understand Stumpf to claim that it violates the basic\ndue process standard, barring fundamentally unfair pro-\ncedure, to allow his death sentence to stand in the after-\nmath of three positions taken by the State: (1) at Stumpf\u2019s\nsentencing hearing; (2) at the trial of Stumpf \u2019s codefen-\ndant, Clyde Wesley; and (3) in response to Stumpf \u2019s mo-\ntion to withdraw his guilty plea in light of the State\u2019s\nposition at the Wesley trial. At the hearing on Stumpf \u2019s\nsentence, the State argued that he was the triggerman,\nand it urged consideration of that fact as a reason to im-\npose a death sentence. App. 186, 188\u2013189. The trial court\nfound that Stumpf had pulled the trigger and did sentence\nhim to death, though it did not state that finding Stumpf\nto be the shooter was dispositive in determining the sen-\ntence. App. to Pet. for Cert. 219a. After the sentencing\nproceeding was over, the State tried the codefendant,\n2                  BRADSHAW v. STUMPF\n\n                    SOUTER, J., concurring\n\nWesley, and on the basis of testimony from a new witness\nargued that Wesley was in fact the triggerman, App. 282,\nand should be sentenced to death. The new witness was\napparently unconvincing to the jury, which in any event\nwas informed that Stumpf had already been sentenced to\ndeath for the crime; the jury rejected the specification that\nnamed Wesley as the triggerman, and it recommended a\nsentence of life, not death. Stumpf then challenged his\ndeath sentence (along with his conviction) on the basis of\nthe prosecution\u2019s position in the Wesley case. In response,\nthe State did not repudiate the position it had taken in the\ncodefendant\u2019s case, or explain that it had made a mistake\nthere. Instead, it merely dismissed the testimony of the\nwitness it had vouched for at Wesley\u2019s trial, id., at 125,\nand maintained that Stumpf \u2019s death sentence should\nstand for some or all of the reasons it originally argued for\nits imposition. At the end of the day, the State was on\nrecord as maintaining that Stumpf and Wesley should\nboth be executed on the ground that each was the trigger-\nman, when it was undisputed that only one of them could\nhave been.\n   Stumpf \u2019s claim as I understand it is not a challenge to\nthe evidentiary basis for arguing for the death penalty in\neither case; nor is it a claim that the prosecution deliber-\nately deceived or attempted to deceive either trial court, as\nin Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U. S. 103 (1935) (per curiam);\nnor does it implicate the rule that inconsistent jury ver-\ndicts may be enforced, United States v. Powell, 469 U. S.\n57 (1984); Dunn v. United States, 284 U. S. 390 (1932). As\nI see it, Stumpf \u2019s argument is simply that a death sen-\ntence may not be allowed to stand when it was imposed in\nresponse to a factual claim that the State necessarily\ncontradicted in subsequently arguing for a death sentence\nin the case of a codefendant. Stumpf\u2019s position was antici-\npated by JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019s observation 10 years ago that\n\u201cserious questions are raised when the sovereign itself\n                  Cite as: 545 U.

Scott,\n513 U. S. 1067, 1070 (1995) (citation and internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019s statement in\nturn echoed the more general one expressed by Justice\nSutherland in Berger v. United States, 295 U. S. 78, 88\n(1935), that the State\u2019s interest in winning some point in a\ngiven case is transcended by its interest \u201cthat justice shall\nbe done.\u201d Ultimately, Stumpf \u2019s argument appears to be\nthat sustaining a death sentence in circumstances like\nthose here results in a sentencing system that invites the\ndeath penalty \u201cto be . . . wantonly and . . . freakishly im-\nposed.\u201d Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U. S. 764, 774 (1990) (quoting\nGregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 188 (1976) (joint opinion\nof Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n   If a due process violation is found in the State\u2019s mainte-\nnance of such inconsistent positions, there will be reme-\ndial questions. May the death sentence stand if the State\ndeclines to repudiate its inconsistent position in the code-\nfendant\u2019s case? Would it be sufficient simply to reexamine\nthe original sentence and if so, which party should have\nthe burden of persuasion?

As the Court notes, the State\nhas not argued that Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989),\nforecloses Stumpf \u2019s claim that the prosecution\u2019s presenta-\ntion of inconsistent theories violated his right to due proc-\ness. Ante, at 6. With certain narrow exceptions, Teague\nprecludes federal courts from granting habeas petitioners\nrelief on the basis of \u201cnew\u201d rules of constitutional law\nestablished after their convictions become final. 489 U. S.,\nat 310 (plurality opinion). This Court has never hinted,\nmuch less held, that the Due Process Clause prevents a\nState from prosecuting defendants based on inconsistent\ntheories. Moreover, it is \u201c[a] threshold question in every\nhabeas case . . . whether the court is obligated to apply the\nTeague rule to the defendant\u2019s claim,\u201d and \u201cif the State\ndoes argue that the defendant seeks the benefit of a new\nrule of constitutional law, the court must apply Teague\nbefore considering the merits of the claim.\u201d Horn v.\nBanks, 536 U. S. 266, 271 (2002) (per curiam) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The State also has not argued\nthat Stumpf procedurally defaulted his due process claim,\neven though it appears that Stumpf never presented this\nargument to the Ohio courts. Stumpf did not even raise\n2                  BRADSHAW v. STUMPF\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nthe inconsistent-theories claim in his first federal habeas\nfilings. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 134a\u2013140a. Instead, the\nDistrict Court raised the issue for Stumpf sua sponte, and\nordered supplemental briefing on the point. See App. 97\u2013\n98. The Court\u2019s opinion does not preclude the State from\nadvancing either of these procedural defenses on remand\nin support of Stumpf\u2019s death sentence.\n   Moreover, I agree with the Court that \u201cStumpf has never\nprovided an explanation of how the prosecution\u2019s postplea\nuse of inconsistent arguments could have affected the\nknowing, voluntary, and intelligent nature of his plea.\u201d\nAnte, at 11. Similar reasoning applies to Stumpf \u2019s sen-\ntence. Stumpf equally has never explained how the prose-\ncution\u2019s use of postsentence inconsistent arguments\u2014\nwhich were based on evidence unavailable until after\nStumpf was sentenced\u2014could have affected the reliability\nor procedural fairness of his death sentence. At most, the\nevidence and purportedly inconsistent theory presented at\nWesley\u2019s trial would constitute newly discovered evidence\ncasting doubt on the reliability of Stumpf \u2019s death sentence,\na sort of claim that our precedents and this Nation\u2019s tradi-\ntions have long foreclosed, see Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S.\n390, 408\u2013417 (1993); id., at 427\u2013428 (SCALIA, J., concur-\nring). The Bill of Rights guarantees vigorous adversarial\ntesting of guilt and innocence and conviction only by proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. These guarantees are more\nthan sufficient to deter the State from taking inconsistent\npositions; a prosecutor who argues inconsistently risks\nundermining his case, for opposing counsel will bring the\nconflict to the factfinder\u2019s attention. See ante, at 2\n(SOUTER, J., concurring) (noting that Wesley\u2019s jury was\ninformed that Stumpf had already been sentenced to\ndeath for the crime).\n",

In adjudicating Stumpf's petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted him relief on two grounds: that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and that his conviction and sentence could not stand because the State, in a later trial of Stumpf's accomplice, pursued a theory of the case inconsistent with the theory it had advanced <span class=\"star-pagination\">*178</span> in Stumpf's case. We granted certiorari to review both holdings. 543 U. S. 1042 (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>On May 14, 1984, Stumpf and two other men, Clyde Daniel Wesley and Norman Leroy Edmonds, were traveling in Edmonds' car along Interstate 70 through Guernsey County, Ohio. Needing money for gas, the men stopped the car along the highway. While Edmonds waited in the car, Stumpf and Wesley walked to the home of Norman and Mary Jane Stout, about 100 yards away. Stumpf and Wesley, each concealing a gun, talked their way into the home by telling the Stouts they needed to use the phone. Their real object, however, was robbery: Once inside, Stumpf held the Stouts at gunpoint, while Wesley ransacked the house. When Mr. Stout moved toward Stumpf, Stumpf shot him twice in the head, causing Mr. Stout to black out. After he regained consciousness, Mr. Stout heard two male voices coming from another room, and then four gunshots \u0097 the shots that killed his wife. Edmonds was arrested shortly afterward, and his statements led the police to issue arrest warrants for Stumpf and Wesley. Stumpf, who surrendered to the police, at first denied any knowledge of the crimes. After he was told that Mr. Stout had survived, however, Stumpf admitted to participating in the robbery and to shooting Mr. Stumpf. But he claimed not to have shot Mrs. Stout, and he has maintained that position ever since.</p>\n<p>The proceedings against Stumpf occurred while Wesley, who had been arrested in Texas, was still resisting extradition to Ohio. Stumpf was indicted for aggravated murder, attempted aggravated murder, aggravated robbery, and two counts of grand theft. With respect to the aggravated murder charge, the indictment listed four statutory \"specifications\" \u0097 three of them aggravating circumstances making Stumpf eligible for the death penalty. See App. 117-118; <span class=\"star-pagination\">*179</span> Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 2929.03 (Anderson 1982).<sup>[*]</sup> The case was assigned to a three-judge panel in the Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p>Rather than proceed to trial, however, Stumpf and the State worked out a plea agreement: Stumpf would plead guilty to aggravated murder and attempted aggravated murder, and the State would drop most of the other charges; with respect to the aggravated murder charge, Stumpf would plead guilty to one of the three capital specifications, with the State dropping the other two. The plea was accepted after a colloquy with the presiding judge, and after a hearing in which the panel satisfied itself as to the factual basis for the plea.</p>\n<p>Because the capital specification to which Stumpf pleaded guilty left him eligible for the death penalty, a contested penalty hearing was held before the same three-judge panel. Stumpf's mitigation case was based in part on his difficult childhood, limited education, dependable work history, youth, and lack of prior serious offenses. Stumpf's principal argument, however, was that he had participated in the plot only at the urging and under the influence of Wesley, that it was Wesley who had fired the fatal shots at Mrs. Stout, and that Stumpf's assertedly minor role in the murder counseled against the death sentence. See \u00a7 2929.04(B)(6) (directing the sentencer to consider as a potential mitigating circumstance, \"[i]f the offender was a participant in the offense but not the principal offender, the degree of the offender's participation in the offense\"). The State, on the other hand, argued that Stumpf had indeed shot Mrs. Stout. Still, while the prosecutor claimed Stumpf's allegedly primary role in the shooting as a special reason to reject Stumpf's mitigation argument, the prosecutor also noted that Ohio law did not restrict the death penalty to those who commit murder by their own hands \u0097 an accomplice to murder could also receive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*180</span> the death penalty, so long as he acted with the specific intent to cause death. As a result, the State argued, Stumpf deserved death even if he had not personally shot Mrs. Stout, because the circumstances of the robbery provided a basis from which to infer Stumpf's intent to cause death. The three-judge panel, agreeing with the State's first contention, specifically found that Stumpf \"was the principal offender\" in the aggravated murder of Mrs. Stout. App. 196. Determining that the aggravating factors in Stumpf's case outweighed any mitigating factors, the panel sentenced Stumpf to death.</p>\n<p>Afterward, Wesley was successfully extradited to Ohio to stand trial. His case was tried to a jury, before the same judge who had presided over the panel overseeing Stumpf's proceedings, and with the same prosecutor. This time, however, the prosecutor had new evidence: James Eastman, Wesley's cellmate after his extradition, testified that <i>Wesley</i> had admitted to firing the shots that killed Mrs. Stout. The prosecutor introduced Eastman's testimony in Wesley's trial, and in his closing argument he argued for Eastman's credibility and lack of motive to lie. The prosecutor claimed that Eastman's testimony, combined with certain circumstantial evidence and with the implausibility of Wesley's own account of events, proved that Wesley was the principal offender in Mrs. Stout's murder \u0097 and that Wesley therefore deserved to be put to death. One way Wesley countered this argument was by noting that the prosecutor had taken a contrary position in Stumpf's trial, and that Stumpf had already been sentenced to death for the crime. Wesley also took the stand in his own defense, and testified that Stumpf had shot Mrs. Stout. In the end, the jury sentenced Wesley to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after 20 years.</p>\n<p>After the Wesley trial, Stumpf, whose direct appeal was still pending in the Ohio Court of Appeals, returned to the Court of Common Pleas with a motion to withdraw his guilty plea or vacate his death sentence. Stumpf argued that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*181</span> Eastman's testimony, and the prosecution's endorsement of that testimony in Wesley's trial, cast doubt upon Stumpf's conviction and sentence. The State (represented again by the same prosecutor who had tried both Wesley's case and Stumpf's original case) disagreed. According to the prosecutor, the court's first task was to decide whether the Eastman testimony was sufficient to alter the court's prior determination that Stumpf had been the shooter. <i>Id.,</i> at 210. Contrary to the argument he had presented in the Wesley trial, however, the prosecutor now noted that Eastman's testimony was belied by certain other evidence (ballistics evidence and Wesley's testimony in his own defense) confirming Stumpf to have been the primary shooter. In the alternative, the State noted as it had before that an aider-and-abettor theory might allow the death sentence to be imposed against Stumpf even if he had not shot Mrs. Stout.</p>\n<p>Although one judge speculated during oral argument that the court's earlier conclusion about Stumpf's principal role in the killing \"may very well have had an effect upon\" the prior sentencing determination, <i>ibid.,</i> the Court of Common Pleas denied Stumpf's motion in a brief summary order without explanation. That order was appealed together with the original judgment in Stumpf's case, and the Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed, as did the Ohio Supreme Court. <i>State</i> v. <i>Stumpf,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></span>, 512 N. E. 2d 598 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U. S. 1079 (1988).</p>\n<p>After a subsequent request for state postconviction relief was denied by the state courts, Stumpf filed this federal habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in November 1995. The District Court denied Stumpf relief, but granted permission to appeal on four claims, including the two at issue here. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, concluding that habeas relief was warranted on \"either or both\" of \"two alternative grounds.\" <i>Stumpf</i> v. <i>Mitchell,</i> 367 F. 3d 594, 596 (2004). First, the court determined that Stumpf's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*182</span> guilty plea was invalid because it had not been entered knowingly and intelligently. More precisely, the court concluded that Stumpf had pleaded guilty to aggravated murder without understanding that specific intent to cause death was a necessary element of the charge under Ohio law. See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a72903.01(B) and (D). Noting that Stumpf had all along denied shooting Mrs. Stout, and considering those denials inconsistent with an informed choice to plead guilty to aggravated murder, the Court of Appeals concluded that Stumpf must have entered his plea out of ignorance. Second, the court concluded that \"Stumpf's due process rights were violated by the state's deliberate action in securing convictions of both Stumpf and Wesley for the same crime, using inconsistent theories.\" 367 F. 3d, at 596. This violation, the court held, required setting aside \"both Stumpf's plea and his sentence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 616. One member of the panel dissented.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Because Stumpf filed his habeas petition before enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), we review his claims under the standards of the pre-AEDPA habeas statute. See <i>Lindh</i> v. <i>Murphy,</i> 521 U. S. 320 (1997). Moreover, because petitioner has not argued that Stumpf's habeas claims were barred as requiring announcement of a new rule, we do not apply the rule of <i>Teague</i> v. <i>Lane,</i> 489 U. S. 288 (1989), to this case. See <i>Schiro</i> v. <i>Farley,</i> 510 U. S. 222, 229 (1994); <i>Godinez</i> v. <i>Moran,</i> 509 U. S. 389, 397, n. 8 (1993).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals concluded that Stumpf's plea of guilty to aggravated murder was invalid because he was not aware of the specific intent element of the charge\u0097a determination we find unsupportable.</p>\n<p>Stumpf's guilty plea would indeed be invalid if he had not been aware of the nature of the charges against him, including <span class=\"star-pagination\">*183</span> the elements of the aggravated murder charge to which he pleaded guilty. A guilty plea operates as a waiver of important rights, and is valid only if done voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently, \"with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.\" <i>Brady</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 397 U. S. 742, 748 (1970). Where a defendant pleads guilty to a crime without having been informed of the crime's elements, this standard is not met and the plea is invalid. <i>Henderson</i> v. <i>Morgan,</i> 426 U. S. 637 (1976).</p>\n<p>But the Court of Appeals erred in finding that Stumpf had not been properly informed before pleading guilty. In Stumpf's plea hearing, his attorneys represented on the record that they had explained to their client the elements of the aggravated murder charge; Stumpf himself then confirmed that this representation was true. See App. 135, 137-138. While the court taking a defendant's plea is responsible for ensuring \"a record adequate for any review that may be later sought,\" <i>Boykin</i> v. <i>Alabama,</i> 395 U. S. 238, 244 (1969) (footnote omitted), we have never held that the judge must himself explain the elements of each charge to the defendant on the record. Rather, the constitutional prerequisites of a valid plea may be satisfied where the record accurately reflects that the nature of the charge and the elements of the crime were explained to the defendant by his own, competent counsel. Cf. <i>Henderson, supra,</i> at 647 (granting relief to a defendant unaware of the elements of his crime, but distinguishing that case from others where \"the record contains either an explanation of the charge by the trial judge, or at least a representation by defense counsel that the nature of the offense has been explained to the accused\"). Where a defendant is represented by competent counsel, the court usually may rely on that counsel's assurance that the defendant has been properly informed of the nature and elements of the charge to which he is pleading guilty.</p>\n<p>Seeking to counter this natural inference, Stumpf argues, in essence, that his choice to plead guilty to the aggravated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*184</span> murder charge was so inconsistent with his denial of having shot the victim that he could only have pleaded guilty out of ignorance of the charge's specific intent requirement. But Stumpf's asserted inconsistency is illusory. The aggravated murder charge's intent element did not require any showing that Stumpf had himself shot Mrs. Stout. Rather, Ohio law considers aiders and abettors equally in violation of the aggravated murder statute, so long as the aiding and abetting is done with the specific intent to cause death. See <i>In re Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1856579\"><a href=\"/opinion/1856579/in-re-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span>, 691 N. E. 2d 285 (1998); <i>State</i> v. <i>Scott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1693533\"><a href=\"/opinion/1693533/state-v-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span>, 165, 400 N. E. 2d 375, 382 (1980). As a result, Stumpf's steadfast assertion that he had not shot Mrs. Stout would not necessarily have precluded him from admitting his specific intent under the statute.</p>\n<p>That is particularly so given the other evidence in this case. Stumpf and Wesley had gone to the Stouts' home together, carrying guns and intending to commit armed robbery. Stumpf, by his own admission, shot <i>Mr.</i> Stout in the head at close range. Taken together, these facts could show that Wesley and Stumpf had together agreed to kill both of the Stouts in order to leave no witnesses to the crime. And that, in turn, could make both men guilty of aggravated murder regardless of who actually killed Mrs. Stout. See <i>ibid.,</i></p>\n<p>Stumpf also points to aspects of the plea hearing transcript which he says show that both he and his attorneys were confused about the relevance and timing of defenses Stumpf and his attorneys had planned to make. First, at one point during the hearing, the presiding judge stated that by pleading guilty Stumpf would waive his trial rights and his right to testify in his own behalf. Stumpf's attorney answered that Stumpf \"was going to respond but we have informed him that there is, after the plea, a hearing or trial relative to the underlying facts so that he is of the belief that there will be [a] presentation of evidence.\" App. 140. The presiding judge responded that \"[o]f course in the sentencing portion of this trial you do have those rights to speak in your own <span class=\"star-pagination\">*185</span> behalf [and] to present evidence and testimony on your own behalf.\" <i>Ibid.</i> A few moments later, there was another exchange along similar lines, after the judge asked Stumpf whether he was \"in fact guilty of\" the aggravated murder charge and its capital specification:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... Your Honor, the defendant has asked me to explain his answer. His answer is yes. He will recite that with obviously his understanding of his right to present evidence at a later time relative to his conduct, but he'll respond to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"JUDGE HENDERSON: At no time am I implying that the defendant will not have the right to present evidence in [the] mitigation hearing.... And I'm going to ask that the defendant, himself, respond to the question that I asked with that understanding that he has the right to present evidence in mitigation. I'm going to ask the defendant if he is in fact guilty of the charge set forth in Count one, including specification one... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 142.</blockquote>\n<p>Reviewing this exchange, the Court of Appeals concluded that Stumpf \"obviously ... was reiterating his desire to challenge the [S]tate's account of his actions\"\u0097that is, to show that he did not intend to kill Mrs. Stout. 367 F. 3d, at 607. But the desire to contest the State's version of events would not necessarily entail the desire to contest the aggravated murder charge or any of its elements. Rather, Stumpf's desire to put on evidence \"relative to the underlying facts\" and \"relative to his conduct\" could equally have meant that Stumpf was eager to make his mitigation case\u0097an interpretation bolstered by the attorney's and Stumpf's approving answers after the presiding judge confirmed that the defense could put on evidence \"in mitigation\" and in \"the sentencing\" phase. While Stumpf's mitigation case was premised on the argument that Stumpf had not shot Mrs. Stout, that was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*186</span> fully consistent with his plea of guilty to aggravated murder. See <i>supra,</i> at 183-184.</p>\n<p>Finally, Stumpf, like the Court of Appeals, relies on the perception that he obtained a bad bargain by his plea\u0097that the State's dropping several nonmurder charges and two of the three capital murder specifications was a bad tradeoff for Stumpf's guilty plea. But a plea's validity may not be collaterally attacked merely because the defendant made what turned out, in retrospect, to be a poor deal. See <i>Brady,</i> 397 U. S., at 757; <i>Mabry</i> v. <i>Johnson,</i> 467 U. S. 504, 508 (1984). Rather, the shortcomings of the deal Stumpf obtained cast doubt on the validity of his plea only if they show either that he made the unfavorable plea on the constitutionally defective advice of counsel, see <i>Tollett</i> v. <i>Henderson,</i> 411 U. S. 258, 267 (1973), or that he could not have understood the terms of the bargain he and Ohio agreed to. Though Stumpf did bring an independent claim asserting ineffective assistance of counsel, that claim is not before us in this case. And in evaluating the validity of Stumpf's plea, we are reluctant to accord much weight to his <i>post hoc</i> reevaluation of the wisdom of the bargain. Stumpf pleaded guilty knowing that the State had copious evidence against him, including the testimony of Mr. Stout; the plea eliminated two of the three capital specifications the State could rely on in seeking the death penalty; and the plea allowed Stumpf to assert his acceptance of responsibility as an argument in mitigation. Under these circumstances, the plea may well have been a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent reaction to a litigation situation that was difficult, to say the least. The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that Stumpf was uninformed about the nature of the charge he pleaded guilty to, and we reverse that portion of the judgment below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals was also wrong to hold that prosecutorial inconsistencies between the Stumpf and Wesley cases <span class=\"star-pagination\">*187</span> required voiding Stumpf's guilty plea. Stumpf's assertions of inconsistency relate entirely to the prosecutor's arguments about which of the two men, Wesley or Stumpf, shot Mrs. Stout. For the reasons given above, see <i>supra,</i> at 183-184, the precise identity of the triggerman was immaterial to Stumpf's conviction for aggravated murder. Moreover, Stumpf has never provided an explanation of how the prosecution's postplea use of inconsistent arguments could have affected the knowing, voluntary, and intelligent nature of his plea.</p>\n<p>The prosecutor's use of allegedly inconsistent theories may have a more direct effect on Stumpf's sentence, however, for it is at least arguable that the sentencing panel's conclusion about Stumpf's principal role in the offense was material to its sentencing determination. The opinion below leaves some ambiguity as to the overlap between how the lower court resolved Stumpf's due process challenge to his conviction, and how it resolved Stumpf's challenge to his sentence. It is not clear whether the Court of Appeals would have concluded that Stumpf was entitled to resentencing had the court not also considered the conviction invalid. Likewise, the parties' briefing to this Court, and the question on which we granted certiorari, largely focused on the lower court's determination about Stumpf's conviction. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Pet. for Cert. ii (requesting review of Stumpf's <i>conviction,</i> not sentence); Reply Brief for Petitioner 3 (challenge to Court of Appeals' decision is focused on issue of conviction); Brief for Respondent 15, n. 3 (\"arguments regarding Stumpf's death sentence are not before this Court\"). In these circumstances, it would be premature for this Court to resolve the merits of Stumpf's sentencing claim, and we therefore express no opinion on whether the prosecutor's actions amounted to a due process violation, or whether any such violation would have been prejudicial. The Court of Appeals should have the opportunity to consider, in the first instance, the question of how Eastman's testimony and the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*188</span> prosecutor's conduct in the Stumpf and Wesley cases relate to Stumpf's death sentence in particular. Accordingly, we vacate the portion of the judgment below relating to Stumpf's prosecutorial inconsistency claim, and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE SOUTER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the opinion of the Court and add this word to explain the issue that I understand we are remanding for further consideration. As the Court notes in its opinion, although respondent John Stumpf challenged both his conviction and his death sentence, his attack on the sentence was not always distinct from the issue raised about the conviction.</p>\n<p>I understand Stumpf to claim that it violates the basic due process standard, barring fundamentally unfair procedure, to allow his death sentence to stand in the aftermath of three positions taken by the State: (1) at Stumpf's sentencing hearing; (2) at the trial of Stumpf's codefendant, Clyde Wesley; and (3) in response to Stumpf's motion to withdraw his guilty plea in light of the State's position at the Wesley trial. At the hearing on Stumpf's sentence, the State argued that he was the triggerman, and it urged consideration of that fact as a reason to impose a death sentence. App. 186, 188-189. The trial court found that Stumpf had pulled the trigger and did sentence him to death, though it did not state that finding Stumpf to be the shooter was dispositive in determining the sentence. App. to Pet. for Cert. 219a. After the sentencing proceeding was over, the State tried the codefendant, Wesley, and on the basis of testimony from a new witness argued that Wesley was in fact the triggerman, App. 282, and should be sentenced to death. The new witness was apparently unconvincing to the jury, which in any event was informed that Stumpf had already been sentenced to death for the crime; the jury rejected the specification that named Wesley as the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*189</span> triggerman, and it recommended a sentence of life, not death. Stumpf then challenged his death sentence (along with his conviction) on the basis of the prosecution's position in the Wesley case. In response, the State did not repudiate the position it had taken in the codefendant's case, or explain that it had made a mistake there. Instead, it merely dismissed the testimony of the witness it had vouched for at Wesley's trial, <i>id.,</i> at 125, and maintained that Stumpf's death sentence should stand for some or all of the reasons it originally argued for its imposition. At the end of the day, the State was on record as maintaining that Stumpf and Wesley should both be executed on the ground that each was the triggerman, when it was undisputed that only one of them could have been.</p>\n<p>Stumpf's claim as I understand it is not a challenge to the evidentiary basis for arguing for the death penalty in either case; nor is it a claim that the prosecution deliberately deceived or attempted to deceive either trial court, as in <i>Mooney</i> v. <i>Holohan,</i> 294 U. S. 103 (1935) <i>(per curiam)</i>; nor does it implicate the rule that inconsistent jury verdicts may be enforced, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Powell,</i> 469 U. S. 57 (1984); <i>Dunn</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 284 U. S. 390 (1932). As I see it, Stumpf's argument is simply that a death sentence may not be allowed to stand when it was imposed in response to a factual claim that the State necessarily contradicted in subsequently arguing for a death sentence in the case of a codefendant. Stumpf's position was anticipated by JUSTICE STEVENS's observation 10 years ago that \"serious questions are raised when the sovereign itself takes inconsistent positions in two separate criminal proceedings against two of its citizens,\" and that \"[t]he heightened need for reliability in capital cases only underscores the gravity of those questions ....\" <i>Jacobs</i> v. <i>Scott,</i> 513 U. S. 1067, 1070 (1995) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). JUSTICE STEVENS's statement in turn echoed the more general one expressed by Justice Sutherland in <i>Berger</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*190</span> 295 U. S. 78, 88 (1935), that the State's interest in winning some point in a given case is transcended by its interest \"that justice shall be done.\" Ultimately, Stumpf's argument appears to be that sustaining a death sentence in circumstances like those here results in a sentencing system that invites the death penalty \"to be ... wantonly and . . . freakishly imposed.\" <i>Lewis</i> v. <i>Jeffers,</i> 497 U. S. 764, 774 (1990) (quoting <i>Gregg</i> v. <i>Georgia,</i> 428 U. S. 153, 188 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>If a due process violation is found in the State's maintenance of such inconsistent positions, there will be remedial questions. May the death sentence stand if the State declines to repudiate its inconsistent position in the codefendant's case? Would it be sufficient simply to reexamine the original sentence and if so, which party should have the burden of persuasion? If more would be required, would a <i>de novo</i> sentencing hearing suffice?</p>\n<p>JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the Court's opinion. As the Court notes, the State has not argued that <i>Teague</i> v. <i>Lane,</i> 489 U. S. 288 (1989), forecloses Stumpf's claim that the prosecution's presentation of inconsistent theories violated his right to due process. <i>Ante,</i> at 182. With certain narrow exceptions, <i>Teague</i> precludes federal courts from granting habeas petitioners relief on the basis of \"new\" rules of constitutional law established after their convictions become final. 489 U. S., at 310 (plurality opinion). This Court has never hinted, much less held, that the Due Process Clause prevents a State from prosecuting defendants based on inconsistent theories. Moreover, it is \"[a] threshold question in every habeas case . . . whether the court is obligated to apply the <i>Teague</i> rule to the defendant's claim,\" and \"if the State does argue <span class=\"star-pagination\">*191</span> that the defendant seeks the benefit of a new rule of constitutional law, the court <i>must</i> apply <i>Teague</i> before considering the merits of the claim.\" <i>Horn</i> v. <i>Banks,</i> 536 U. S. 266, 271 (2002) <i>(per curiam)</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). The State also has not argued that Stumpf procedurally defaulted his due process claim, even though it appears that Stumpf never presented this argument to the Ohio courts. Stumpf did not even raise the inconsistent-theories claim in his first federal habeas filings. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 134a-140a. Instead, the District Court raised the issue for Stumpf <i>sua sponte,</i> and ordered supplemental briefing on the point. See App. 97-98. The Court's opinion does not preclude the State from advancing either of these procedural defenses on remand in support of Stumpf's death sentence.</p>\n<p>Moreover, I agree with the Court that \"Stumpf has never provided an explanation of how the prosecution's postplea use of inconsistent arguments could have affected the knowing, voluntary, and intelligent nature of his plea.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 187. Similar reasoning applies to Stumpf's sentence. Stumpf equally has never explained how the prosecution's use of postsentence inconsistent arguments\u0097which were based on evidence unavailable until after Stumpf was sentenced\u0097could have affected the reliability or procedural fairness of his death sentence. At most, the evidence and purportedly inconsistent theory presented at Wesley's trial would constitute newly discovered evidence casting doubt on the reliability of Stumpf's death sentence, a sort of claim that our precedents and this Nation's traditions have long foreclosed, see <i>Herrera</i> v. <i>Collins,</i> 506 U. S. 390, 408-417 (1993); <i>id.,</i> at 427-428 (SCALIA, J., concurring). The Bill of Rights guarantees vigorous adversarial testing of guilt and innocence and conviction only by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. These guarantees are more than sufficient to deter the State from taking inconsistent positions; a prosecutor who argues inconsistently risks undermining his case, for opposing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*192</span> counsel will bring the conflict to the factfinder's attention. See <i>ante,</i> at 188 (SOUTER, J., concurring) (noting that Wesley's jury was informed that Stumpf had already been sentenced to death for the crime).</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   <i>Ellen S.
