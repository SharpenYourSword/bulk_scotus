We hold that even when a capital defendant's family members and the defendant himself have suggested that no mitigating evidence is available, his lawyer is bound to make reasonable efforts to obtain and review material that counsel knows the prosecution will probably rely on as evidence of aggravation at the sentencing phase of trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>On the morning of January 14, 1988, James Scanlon was discovered dead in a bar he ran in Allentown, Pennsylvania, his body having been stabbed repeatedly and set on fire. Ronald Rompilla was indicted for the murder and related offenses, and the Commonwealth gave notice of intent to ask <span class=\"star-pagination\">*378</span> for the death penalty. Two public defenders were assigned to the case.</p>\n<p>The jury at the guilt phase of trial found Rompilla guilty on all counts, and during the ensuing penalty phase, the prosecutor sought to prove three aggravating factors to justify a death sentence: that the murder was committed in the course of another felony; that the murder was committed by torture; and that Rompilla had a significant history of felony convictions indicating the use or threat of violence. See 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 9711(d)(6), (8), (9) (2002). The Commonwealth presented evidence on all three aggravators, and the jury found all proven. Rompilla's evidence in mitigation consisted of relatively brief testimony: five of his family members argued in effect for residual doubt, and beseeched the jury for mercy, saying that they believed Rompilla was innocent and a good man. Rompilla's 14-year-old son testified that he loved his father and would visit him in prison. The jury acknowledged this evidence to the point of finding, as two factors in mitigation, that Rompilla's son had testified on his behalf and that rehabilitation was possible. But the jurors assigned the greater weight to the aggravating factors, and sentenced Rompilla to death. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed both conviction and sentence. <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Rompilla,</i> 539 Pa. 499, 653 A.2d 626 (1995).</p>\n<p>In December 1995, with new lawyers, Rompilla filed claims under the Pennsylvania Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 9541 <i>et seq.</i> (2004), including ineffective assistance by trial counsel in failing to present significant mitigating evidence about Rompilla's childhood, mental capacity and health, and alcoholism. The postconviction court found that trial counsel had done enough to investigate the possibilities of a mitigation case, and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the denial of relief. <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Rompilla,</i> 554 Pa. 378, 721 A.2d 786 (1998).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*379</span> Rompilla then petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254 in Federal District Court, raising claims that included inadequate representation. The District Court found that the State Supreme Court had unreasonably applied <i>Strickland</i> v. <i>Washington,</i> 466 U. S. 668 (1984), as to the penalty phase of the trial, and granted relief for ineffective assistance of counsel. The court found that in preparing the mitigation case the defense lawyers had failed to investigate \"pretty obvious signs\" that Rompilla had a troubled childhood and suffered from mental illness and alcoholism, and instead had relied unjustifiably on Rompilla's own description of an unexceptional background. <i>Rompilla</i> v. <i>Horn,</i> No. CIV.A.99-737 (ED Pa., July 11, 2000), App. 1307-1308.</p>\n<p>A divided Third Circuit panel reversed. <i>Rompilla</i> v. <i>Horn,</i> 355 F.3d 233 (2004). The majority found nothing unreasonable in the state court's application of <i>Strickland,</i> given defense counsel's efforts to uncover mitigation material, which included interviewing Rompilla and certain family members, as well as consultation with three mental health experts. Although the majority noted that the lawyers did not unearth the \"useful information\" to be found in Rompilla's \"school, medical, police, and prison records,\" it thought the lawyers were justified in failing to hunt through these records when their other efforts gave no reason to believe the search would yield anything helpful. 355 F.3d, at 252. The panel thus distinguished Rompilla's case from <i>Wiggins</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> 539 U. S. 510 (2003). Whereas Wiggins's counsel failed to investigate adequately, to the point even of ignoring the leads their limited enquiry yielded, the Court of Appeals saw the Rompilla investigation as going far enough to leave counsel with reason for thinking further efforts would not be a wise use of the limited resources they had. But Judge Sloviter's dissent stressed that trial counsel's failure to obtain relevant records on Rompilla's background was owing to the lawyers' unreasonable reliance on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*380</span> family members and medical experts to tell them what records might be useful. The Third Circuit denied rehearing en banc by a vote of 6 to 5. <i>Rompilla</i> v. <i>Horn,</i> 359 F.3d 310 (2004).</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 542 U. S. 966 (2004), and now reverse.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254, Rompilla's entitlement to federal habeas relief turns on showing that the state court's resolution of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under <i>Strickland</i> v. <i>Washington, supra</i><i>,</i> \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\" \u00a7 2254(d)(1). An \"unreasonable application\" occurs when a state court \"`identifies the correct governing legal principle from this Court's decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts' of petitioner's case.\" <i>Wiggins</i> v. <i>Smith, supra,</i> at 520 (quoting <i>Williams</i> v. <i>Taylor,</i> 529 U. S. 362, 413 (2000) (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.)). That is, \"the state court's decision must have been [not only] incorrect or erroneous [but] objectively unreasonable.\" <i>Wiggins</i> v. <i>Smith, supra,</i> at 520-521 (quoting <i>Williams</i> v. <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 409 (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>Ineffective assistance under <i>Strickland</i> is deficient performance by counsel resulting in prejudice, 466 U. S., at 687, with performance being measured against an \"objective standard of reasonableness,\" <i>id.,</i> at 688, \"under prevailing professional norms,\" <i>ibid.; </i><i>Wiggins</i> v. <i>Smith, supra,</i> at 521. This case, like some others recently, looks to norms of adequate investigation in preparing for the sentencing phase of a capital trial, when defense counsel's job is to counter the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*381</span> State's evidence of aggravated culpability with evidence in mitigation. In judging the defense's investigation, as in applying <i>Strickland</i> generally, hindsight is discounted by pegging adequacy to \"counsel's perspective at the time\" investigative decisions are made, 466 U. S., at 689, and by giving a \"heavy measure of deference to counsel's judgments,\" <i>id.,</i> at 691.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>A standard of reasonableness applied as if one stood in counsel's shoes spawns few hard-edged rules, and the merits of a number of counsel's choices in this case are subject to fair debate. This is not a case in which defense counsel simply ignored their obligation to find mitigating evidence, and their workload as busy public defenders did not keep them from making a number of efforts, including interviews with Rompilla and some members of his family, and examinations of reports by three mental health experts who gave opinions at the guilt phase. None of the sources proved particularly helpful.</p>\n<p>Rompilla's own contributions to any mitigation case were minimal. Counsel found him uninterested in helping, as on their visit to his prison to go over a proposed mitigation strategy, when Rompilla told them he was \"bored being here listening\" and returned to his cell. App. 668. To questions about childhood and schooling, his answers indicated they had been normal, <i>ibid.,</i> save for quitting school in the ninth grade, <i>id.,</i> at 677. There were times when Rompilla was even actively obstructive by sending counsel off on false leads. <i>Id.,</i> at 663-664.</p>\n<p>The lawyers also spoke with five members of Rompilla's family (his former wife, two brothers, a sister-in-law, and his son), <i>id.,</i> at 494, and counsel testified that they developed a good relationship with the family in the course of their representation, <i>id.,</i> at 669, 729. The state postconviction court found that counsel spoke to the relatives in a \"detailed manner,\" attempting to unearth mitigating information, <i>id.,</i> at 264, although the weight of this finding is qualified by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*382</span> lawyers' concession that \"the overwhelming response from the family was that they didn't really feel as though they knew him all that well since he had spent the majority of his adult years and some of his childhood years in custody,\" <i>id.,</i> at 495; see also <i>id.,</i> at 669. Defense counsel also said that because the family was \"coming from the position that [Rompilla] was innocent . . . they weren't looking for reasons for why he might have done this.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 494.</p>\n<p>The third and final source tapped for mitigating material was the cadre of three mental health witnesses who were asked to look into Rompilla's mental state as of the time of the offense and his competency to stand trial. <i>Id.,</i> at 473-474, 476. But their reports revealed \"nothing useful\" to Rompilla's case, <i>id.,</i> at 1358, and the lawyers consequently did not go to any other historical source that might have cast light on Rompilla's mental condition.</p>\n<p>When new counsel entered the case to raise Rompilla's postconviction claims, however, they identified a number of likely avenues the trial lawyers could fruitfully have followed in building a mitigation case. School records are one example, which trial counsel never examined in spite of the professed unfamiliarity of the several family members with Rompilla's childhood, and despite counsel's knowledge that Rompilla left school after the ninth grade. <i>Id.,</i> at 677. Other examples are records of Rompilla's juvenile and adult incarcerations, which counsel did not consult, although they were aware of their client's criminal record. And while counsel knew from police reports provided in pretrial discovery that Rompilla had been drinking heavily at the time of his offense, Lodging to App. 111-120 (hereinafter Lodging), and although one of the mental health experts reported that Rompilla's troubles with alcohol merited further investigation, App. 723-724, counsel did not look for evidence of a history of dependence on alcohol that might have extenuating significance.</p>\n<p>Before us, trial counsel and the Commonwealth respond to these unexplored possibilities by emphasizing this Court's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*383</span> recognition that the duty to investigate does not force defense lawyers to scour the globe on the off chance something will turn up; reasonably diligent counsel may draw a line when they have good reason to think further investigation would be a waste. See <i>Wiggins</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> 539 U. S., at 525 (further investigation excusable where counsel has evidence suggesting it would be fruitless); <i>Strickland</i> v. <i>Washington, supra,</i> at 699 (counsel could \"reasonably surmise . . . that character and psychological evidence would be of little help\"); <i>Burger</i> v. <i>Kemp,</i> 483 U. S. 776, 794 (1987) (limited investigation reasonable because all witnesses brought to counsel's attention provided predominantly harmful information). The Commonwealth argues that the information trial counsel gathered from Rompilla and the other sources gave them sound reason to think it would have been pointless to spend time and money on the additional investigation espoused by postconviction counsel, and we can say that there is room for debate about trial counsel's obligation to follow at least some of those potential lines of enquiry. There is no need to say more, however, for a further point is clear and dispositive: the lawyers were deficient in failing to examine the court file on Rompilla's prior conviction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>There is an obvious reason that the failure to examine Rompilla's prior conviction file fell below the level of reasonable performance. Counsel knew that the Commonwealth intended to seek the death penalty by proving Rompilla had a significant history of felony convictions indicating the use or threat of violence, an aggravator under state law. Counsel further knew that the Commonwealth would attempt to establish this history by proving Rompilla's prior conviction for rape and assault, and would emphasize his violent character by introducing a transcript of the rape victim's testimony given in that earlier trial. App. 665-666. There is no question that defense counsel were on notice, since they acknowledge that a \"plea letter,\" written by one of them four days <span class=\"star-pagination\">*384</span> prior to trial, mentioned the prosecutor's plans. <i>Ibid.</i> It is also undisputed that the prior conviction file was a public document, readily available for the asking at the very courthouse where Rompilla was to be tried.</p>\n<p>It is clear, however, that defense counsel did not look at any part of that file, including the transcript, until warned by the prosecution a second time. In a colloquy the day before the evidentiary sentencing phase began, the prosecutor again said he would present the transcript of the victim's testimony to establish the prior conviction.</p>\n<blockquote>\"[DEFENSE]: I would also like to review whatever he's going to read from.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"[PROSECUTOR]: Well, I told you that I was going to do this a long time ago. You certainly had the opportunity to review the Transcript.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>.      .      .      .      .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"[DEFENSE]: Well, I would like a copy of this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"[PROSECUTOR]: I don't think that's my duty to provide you with a copy. That's a public record, and you could have gotten that Transcript at any time prior to this Trial. I made one copy for myself, and I'd like to have it now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"[DEFENSE]: Well, Judge, then I'm going to need to get a copy of it. I'm going to need to get a copy of it.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 32, 36.<sup>[2]</sup></blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*385</span> At the postconviction evidentiary hearing, Rompilla's lawyer confirmed that she had not seen the transcript before the hearing in which this exchange took place, <i>id.,</i> at 506-507, and crucially, even after obtaining the transcript of the victim's testimony on the eve of the sentencing hearing, counsel apparently examined none of the other material in the file.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>With every effort to view the facts as a defense lawyer would have done at the time, it is difficult to see how counsel could have failed to realize that without examining the readily available file they were seriously compromising their opportunity to respond to a case for aggravation. The prosecution was going to use the dramatic facts of a similar prior offense, and Rompilla's counsel had a duty to make all reasonable efforts to learn what they could about the offense. Reasonable efforts certainly included obtaining the Commonwealth's own readily available file on the prior conviction to learn what the Commonwealth knew about the crime, to discover any mitigating evidence the Commonwealth would downplay, and to anticipate the details of the aggravating <span class=\"star-pagination\">*386</span> evidence the Commonwealth would emphasize.<sup>[4]</sup> Without making reasonable efforts to review the file, defense counsel could have had no hope of knowing whether the prosecution was quoting selectively from the transcript, or whether there were circumstances extenuating the behavior described by the victim. The obligation to get the file was particularly pressing here owing to the similarity of the violent prior offense to the crime charged and Rompilla's sentencing strategy stressing residual doubt. Without making efforts to learn the details and rebut the relevance of the earlier crime, a convincing argument for residual doubt was certainly beyond any hope.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*387</span> The notion that defense counsel must obtain information that the State has and will use against the defendant is not simply a matter of common sense. As the District Court points out, the American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice in circulation at the time of Rompilla's trial describes the obligation in terms no one could misunderstand in the circumstances of a case like this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\"It is the duty of the lawyer to conduct a prompt investigation of the circumstances of the case and to explore all avenues leading to facts relevant to the merits of the case and the penalty in the event of conviction. The investigation should always include efforts to secure information in the possession of the prosecution and law enforcement authorities. The duty to investigate exists regardless of the accused's admissions or statements to the lawyer of facts constituting guilt or the accused's stated desire to plead guilty.\" 1 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 4-4.1 (2d ed. 1982 Supp.).<sup>[6]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>\"[W]e long have referred [to these ABA Standards] as `guides to determining what is reasonable.'\" <i>Wiggins</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> 539 U. S., at 524 (quoting <i>Strickland</i> v. <i>Washington,</i> 466 U. S., at 688), and the Commonwealth has come up with no reason to think the quoted standard impertinent here.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*388</span> At argument the most that Pennsylvania (and the United States as <i>amicus</i>) could say was that defense counsel's efforts to find mitigating evidence by other means excused them from looking at the prior conviction file. Tr. of Oral Arg. 37-39, 45-46. And that, of course, is the position taken by the state postconviction courts. Without specifically discussing the prior case file, they too found that defense counsel's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*389</span> efforts were enough to free them from any obligation to enquire further. <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Rompilla,</i> No. 682/1988 (Pa. Ct. Common Pleas, Aug. 23, 1996), App. 263-264, 272-273.</p>\n<p>We think this conclusion of the state court fails to answer the considerations we have set out, to the point of being an objectively unreasonable conclusion. It flouts prudence to deny that a defense lawyer should try to look at a file he knows the prosecution will cull for aggravating evidence, let alone when the file is sitting in the trial courthouse, open for the asking. No reasonable lawyer would forgo examination of the file thinking he could do as well by asking the defendant or family relations whether they recalled anything helpful or damaging in the prior victim's testimony. Nor would a reasonable lawyer compare possible searches for school reports, juvenile records, and evidence of drinking habits to the opportunity to take a look at a file disclosing what the prosecutor knows and even plans to read from in his case. Questioning a few more family members and searching for old records can promise less than looking for a needle in a haystack, when a lawyer truly has reason to doubt there is any needle there. <i>E. g., </i><i>Strickland, supra,</i> at 699. But looking at a file the prosecution says it will use is a sure bet: whatever may be in that file is going to tell defense counsel something about what the prosecution can produce.</p>\n<p>The dissent thinks this analysis creates a \"rigid, <i>per se</i>\" rule that requires defense counsel to do a complete review of the file on any prior conviction introduced, <i>post,</i> at 9 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.), but that is a mistake. Counsel fell short here because they failed to make reasonable efforts to review the prior conviction file, despite knowing that the prosecution intended to introduce Rompilla's prior conviction not merely by entering a notice of conviction into evidence but by quoting damaging testimony of the rape victim in that case. The unreasonableness of attempting no more than they did was heightened by the easy availability of the file <span class=\"star-pagination\">*390</span> at the trial courthouse, and the great risk that testimony about a similar violent crime would hamstring counsel's chosen defense of residual doubt. It is owing to these circumstances that the state courts were objectively unreasonable in concluding that counsel could reasonably decline to make any effort to review the file. Other situations, where a defense lawyer is not charged with knowledge that the prosecutor intends to use a prior conviction in this way, might well warrant a different assessment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Since counsel's failure to look at the file fell below the line of reasonable practice, there is a further question about prejudice, that is, whether \"there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" 466 U. S., at 694. Because the state courts found the representation adequate, they never reached the issue of prejudice, App. 265, 272-273, and so we examine this element of the <i>Strickland</i> claim <i>de novo, </i><i>Wiggins</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> 539 U. S., at 534, and agree with the dissent in the Court of Appeals. We think Rompilla has shown beyond any doubt that counsel's lapse was prejudicial; Pennsylvania, indeed, does not even contest the claim of prejudice.</p>\n<p>If the defense lawyers had looked in the file on Rompilla's prior conviction, it is uncontested they would have found a range of mitigation leads that no other source had opened up. In the same file with the transcript of the prior trial were the records of Rompilla's imprisonment on the earlier conviction, App. 508, 571, 631, which defense counsel testified she had never seen, <i>id.,</i> at 508. The prison files pictured Rompilla's childhood and mental health very differently from anything defense counsel had seen or heard. An evaluation by a corrections counselor states that Rompilla was \"reared in the slum environment of Allentown, Pa. vicinity. He early came to [the] attention of juvenile authorities, quit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*391</span> school at 16, [and] started a series of incarcerations in and out Penna. often of assaultive nature and commonly related to over-indulgence in alcoholic beverages.\" Lodging 40. The same file discloses test results that the defense's mental health experts would have viewed as pointing to schizophrenia and other disorders, and test scores showing a third grade level of cognition after nine years of schooling. <i>Id.,</i> at 32-35.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>The accumulated entries would have destroyed the benign conception of Rompilla's upbringing and mental capacity defense counsel had formed from talking with Rompilla himself and some of his family members, and from the reports of the mental health experts. With this information, counsel would have become skeptical of the impression given by the five family members and would unquestionably have gone further to build a mitigation case. Further effort would presumably have unearthed much of the material post-conviction counsel found, including testimony from several members of Rompilla's family, whom trial counsel did not interview. Judge Sloviter summarized this evidence:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Rompilla's parents were both severe alcoholics who drank constantly. His mother drank during her pregnancy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*392</span> with Rompilla, and he and his brothers eventually developed serious drinking problems. His father, who had a vicious temper, frequently beat Rompilla's mother, leaving her bruised and black-eyed, and bragged about his cheating on her. His parents fought violently, and on at least one occasion his mother stabbed his father. He was abused by his father who beat him when he was young with his hands, fists, leather straps, belts and sticks. All of the children lived in terror. There were no expressions of parental love, affection or approval. Instead, he was subjected to yelling and verbal abuse. His father locked Rompilla and his brother Richard in a small wire mesh dog pen that was filthy and excrement filled. He had an isolated background, and was not allowed to visit other children or to speak to anyone on the phone. They had no indoor plumbing in the house, he slept in the attic with no heat, and the children were not given clothes and attended school in rags.\" 355 F. 3d, at 279 (dissenting opinion) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>The jury never heard any of this and neither did the mental health experts who examined Rompilla before trial. While they found \"nothing helpful to [Rompilla's] case,\" <i>Rompilla,</i> 554 Pa., at 385, 721 A. 2d, at 790, their post-conviction counterparts, alerted by information from school, medical, and prison records that trial counsel never saw, found plenty of \"`red flags'\" pointing up a need to test further. 355 F. 3d, at 279 (Sloviter, J., dissenting). When they tested, they found that Rompilla \"suffers from organic brain damage, an extreme mental disturbance significantly impairing several of his cognitive functions.\" <i>Ibid.</i> They also said that \"Rompilla's problems relate back to his childhood, and were likely caused by fetal alcohol syndrome [and that] Rompilla's capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the law was substantially impaired at the time of the offense.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 280 (Sloviter, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*393</span> These findings in turn would probably have prompted a look at school and juvenile records, all of them easy to get, showing, for example, that when Rompilla was 16 his mother \"was missing from home frequently for a period of one or several weeks at a time.\" Lodging 44. The same report noted that his mother \"has been reported . . . frequently under the influence of alcoholic beverages, with the result that the children have always been poorly kept and on the filthy side which was also the condition of the home at all times.\" <i>Ibid.</i> School records showed Rompilla's IQ was in the mentally retarded range. <i>Id.,</i> at 11, 13, 15.</p>\n<p>This evidence adds up to a mitigation case that bears no relation to the few naked pleas for mercy actually put before the jury, and although we suppose it is possible that a jury could have heard it all and still have decided on the death penalty, that is not the test. It goes without saying that the undiscovered \"mitigating evidence, taken as a whole, `might well have influenced the jury's appraisal' of [Rompilla's] culpability,\" <i>Wiggins</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> 539 U. S., at 538 (quoting <i>Williams</i> v. <i>Taylor,</i> 529 U. S., at 398), and the likelihood of a different result if the evidence had gone in is \"sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\" actually reached at sentencing, <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U. S., at 694.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Third Circuit is reversed, and Pennsylvania must either retry the case on penalty or stipulate to a life sentence.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concurring.</p>\n<p>I write separately to put to rest one concern. The dissent worries that the Court's opinion \"imposes on defense counsel a rigid requirement to review all documents in what it calls the `case file' of any prior conviction that the prosecution might rely on at trial.\" <i>Post,</i> at 396 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). But the Court's opinion imposes no such rule. See <i>ante,</i> at 389-390. Rather, today's decision simply applies <span class=\"star-pagination\">*394</span> our longstanding case-by-case approach to determining whether an attorney's performance was unconstitutionally deficient under <i>Strickland</i> v. <i>Washington,</i> 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Trial counsel's performance in Rompilla's case falls short under that standard, because the attorneys' behavior was not \"reasonable considering all the circumstances.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 688. In particular, there were three circumstances which made the attorneys' failure to examine Rompilla's prior conviction file unreasonable.</p>\n<p>First, Rompilla's attorneys knew that their client's prior conviction would be at the very heart of the <i>prosecution's</i> case. The prior conviction went not to a collateral matter, but rather to one of the aggravating circumstances making Rompilla eligible for the death penalty. The prosecutors intended not merely to mention the fact of prior conviction, but to read testimony about the details of the crime. That crime, besides being quite violent in its own right, was very similar to the murder for which Rompilla was on trial, and Rompilla had committed the murder at issue a mere three months after his release from prison on the earlier conviction. In other words, the prosecutor clearly planned to use details of the prior crime as powerful evidence that Rompilla was a dangerous man for whom the death penalty would be both appropriate punishment and a necessary means of incapacitation. Cf. App. 165-166 (prosecutor's penalty-phase argument). This was evidence the defense should have been prepared to meet: A reasonable defense lawyer would have attached a high importance to obtaining the record of the prior trial, in order to anticipate and find ways of deflecting the prosecutor's aggravation argument.</p>\n<p>Second, the prosecutor's planned use of the prior conviction threatened to eviscerate one of the <i>defense's</i> primary mitigation arguments. Rompilla was convicted on the basis of strong circumstantial evidence. His lawyers structured the entire mitigation argument around the hope of convincing the jury that residual doubt about Rompilla's guilt made <span class=\"star-pagination\">*395</span> it inappropriate to impose the death penalty. In announcing an intention to introduce testimony about Rompilla's similar prior offense, the prosecutor put Rompilla's attorneys on notice that the prospective defense on mitigation likely would be ineffective and counterproductive. The similarities between the two crimes, combined with the timing and the already strong circumstantial evidence, raised a strong likelihood that the jury would reject Rompilla's residual doubt argument. Rompilla's attorneys' reliance on this transparently weak argument risked damaging their credibility. Such a scenario called for further investigation, to determine whether circumstances of the prior case gave any hope of saving the residual doubt argument, or whether the best strategy instead would be to jettison that argument so as to focus on other, more promising issues. Cf. <i>Yarborough</i> v. <i>Gentry,</i> 540 U. S. 1, 7 (2003) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>Bell</i> v. <i>Cone,</i> 535 U. S. 685, 700 (2002) (noting that sound tactical judgment may sometimes call for omitting certain defense evidence or arguments).</p>\n<p>Third, the attorneys' decision not to obtain Rompilla's prior conviction file was not the result of an informed tactical decision about how the lawyers' time would best be spent. Although Rompilla's attorneys had ample warning that the details of Rompilla's prior conviction would be critical to their case, their failure to obtain that file would not necessarily have been deficient if it had resulted from the lawyers' careful exercise of judgment about how best to marshal their time and serve their client. But Rompilla's attorneys did not ignore the prior case file in order to spend their time on other crucial leads. They did not determine that the file was so inaccessible or so large that examining it would necessarily divert them from other trial-preparation tasks they thought more promising. They did not learn at the 11th hour about the prosecution's intent to use the prior conviction, when it was too late for them to change plans. Rather, their failure to obtain the crucial file \"was the result of inattention, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*396</span> not reasoned strategic judgment.\" <i>Wiggins</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> 539 U. S. 510, 534 (2003). As a result, their conduct fell below constitutionally required standards. See <i>id.,</i> at 533 (\"`[S]trategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable' only to the extent that `reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation'\" (quoting <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U. S., at 690-691)).</p>\n<p>In the particular circumstances of this case, the attorneys' failure to obtain and review the case file from their client's prior conviction did not meet standards of \"reasonable professional judgmen[t].\" <i>Id.,</i> at 691. Because the Court's opinion is consistent with the \"`case-by-case examination of the evidence'\" called for under our cases, <i>Williams</i> v. <i>Taylor,</i> 529 U. S. 362, 391 (2000), I join the opinion.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA, and JUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Today the Court brands two committed criminal defense attorneys as ineffective \u0097 \"outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance,\" <i>Strickland</i> v. <i>Washington,</i> 466 U. S. 668, 690 (1984) \u0097 because they did not look in an old case file and stumble upon something they had not set out to find. By implication the Court also labels incompetent the work done by the three mental health professionals who examined Ronald Rompilla. To reach this result, the majority imposes on defense counsel a rigid requirement to review all documents in what it calls the \"case file\" of any prior conviction that the prosecution might rely on at trial. The Court's holding, a mistake under any standard of review, is all the more troubling because this case arises under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. In order to grant Rompilla habeas relief the Court must say, and indeed does say, that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was objectively unreasonable in failing to anticipate today's new case file rule.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*397</span> In my respectful submission it is this Court, not the state court, which is unreasonable. The majority's holding has no place in our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence and, if followed, often will result in less effective counsel by diverting limited defense resources from other important tasks in order to satisfy the Court's new <i>per se</i> rule. Finally, even if the Court could justify its distortion of <i>Strickland,</i> Rompilla still would not be entitled to relief. The Court is able to conclude otherwise only by ignoring the established principle that it is the defendant, not the State, who has the burden of demonstrating that he was prejudiced by any deficiency in his attorneys' performance.</p>\n<p>These are the reasons for my dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Under any standard of review the investigation performed by Rompilla's counsel in preparation for sentencing was not only adequate but also conscientious.</p>\n<p>Rompilla's attorneys recognized from the outset that building an effective mitigation case was crucial to helping their client avoid the death penalty. App. 516, 576. Rompilla stood accused of a brutal crime. In January 1988, James Scanlon was murdered while he was closing the Cozy Corner Cafe, a bar he owned in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Scanlon's body was discovered later the next morning, lying in a pool of blood. Scanlon had been stabbed multiple times, including 16 wounds around the neck and head. Scanlon also had been beaten with a blunt object, and his face had been gashed, possibly with shards from broken liquor and beer bottles found at the scene of the crime. After Scanlon was stabbed to death his body had been set on fire.</p>\n<p>Substantial evidence linked Rompilla to the crime. See generally <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Rompilla,</i> 539 Pa. 499, 505-506, 653 A. 2d 626, 629-630 (1995). He was at the Cozy Corner Cafe near closing time on the night of the murder and was observed going to the bathroom approximately 10 times during <span class=\"star-pagination\">*398</span> a 1-hour period. A window in that bathroom, the police later determined, was the probable point of entry used by Scanlon's assailant. A pair of Rompilla's sneakers seized by the police matched a bloody footprint found near the victim's body, and blood on the sneakers matched the victim's blood type. Rompilla's fingerprint was found on one of the two knives used to commit the murder. Sometime after leaving the bar on the night of the murder, Rompilla checked into a nearby motel under a false name. Although he told the police he left the bar with only two dollars, Rompilla had paid cash for the room and flashed a large amount of money to the desk clerks. The victim's wallet was discovered in the bushes just outside of Rompilla's motel room. When the police questioned Rompilla about the murder, his version of events was inconsistent with the testimony of other witnesses.</p>\n<p>Rompilla was represented at trial by Fredrick Charles, the chief public defender for Lehigh County at the time, and Maria Dantos, an assistant public defender. Charles and Dantos were assisted by John Whispell, an investigator in the public defender's office. Rompilla's defense team sought to develop mitigating evidence from various sources. First, they questioned Rompilla extensively about his upbringing and background. App. 668-669. To make these conversations more productive they provided Rompilla with a list of the mitigating circumstances recognized by Pennsylvania law. <i>Id.,</i> at 657. Cf. <i>Strickland, supra,</i> at 691 (\"[W]hen a defendant has given counsel reason to believe that pursuing certain investigations would be fruitless or even harmful, counsel's failure to pursue those investigations may not later be challenged as unreasonable\"). Second, Charles and Dantos arranged for Rompilla to be examined by three experienced mental health professionals, experts described by Charles as \"the best forensic psychiatrist around here, [another] tremendous psychiatrist and a fabulous forensic psychologist.\" App. 672. Finally, Rompilla's attorneys questioned <span class=\"star-pagination\">*399</span> his family extensively in search of any information that might help spare Rompilla the death penalty. <i>Id.,</i> at 493-494, 557-558, 669-670, 729-730. Dantos, in particular, developed a \"very close\" relationship with Rompilla's family, which was a \"constant source of information.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 557, 729. Indeed, after trial Rompilla's wife sent Dantos a letter expressing her gratitude. <i>Id.,</i> at 733. The letter referred to Charles and Dantos as \"superb human beings\" who \"fought and felt everything [Rompilla's] family did.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Court acknowledges the steps taken by Rompilla's attorneys in preparation for sentencing but finds fault nonetheless. \"[T]he lawyers were deficient,\" the Court says, \"in failing to examine the court file on Rompilla's prior conviction.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 383.</p>\n<p>The prior conviction the Court refers to is Rompilla's 1974 conviction for rape, burglary, and theft. See <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Rompilla,</i> 250 Pa. Super. 139, 378 A. 2d 865 (1977). Before the sentencing phase of the capital case, the Commonwealth informed Rompilla's attorneys that it intended to use these prior crimes to prove one of the statutory aggravating circumstances \u0097 namely, that Rompilla had a \"significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person.\" 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 9711(d)(9) (2002). Rompilla's attorneys were on notice of the Commonwealth's plans, and from this the Court concludes that effective assistance of counsel required a review of the prior conviction case file.</p>\n<p>A <i>per se</i> rule requiring counsel in every case to review the records of prior convictions used by the State as aggravation evidence is a radical departure from <i>Strickland</i> and its progeny. We have warned in the past against the creation of \"specific guidelines\" or \"checklist[s] for judicial evaluation of attorney performance.\" 466 U. S., at 688. See also <i>Wiggins</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> 539 U. S. 510, 521 (2003); <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Flores-Ortega,</i> 528 U. S. 470, 477 (2000). \"No particular set of detailed rules for counsel's conduct can satisfactorily take account of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*400</span> the variety of circumstances faced by defense counsel or the range of legitimate decisions regarding how best to represent a criminal defendant. Any such set of rules would interfere with the constitutionally protected independence of counsel and restrict the wide latitude counsel must have in making tactical decisions. Indeed, the existence of detailed guidelines for representation could distract counsel from the overriding mission of vigorous advocacy of the defendant's cause.\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U. S., at 688-689 (citations omitted). For this reason, while we have referred to the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice as a useful point of reference, we have been careful to say these standards \"are only guides\" and do not establish the constitutional baseline for effective assistance of counsel. <i>Ibid.</i> The majority, by parsing the guidelines as if they were binding statutory text, ignores this admonition.</p>\n<p>The majority's analysis contains barely a mention of <i>Strickland</i> and makes little effort to square today's holding with our traditional reluctance to impose rigid requirements on defense counsel. While the Court disclaims any intention to create a bright-line rule, <i>ante,</i> at 389-390; see also <i>ante,</i> at 393-394 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring), this affords little comfort. The Court's opinion makes clear it has imposed on counsel a broad obligation to review prior conviction case files where those priors are used in aggravation \u0097 and to review every document in those files if not every single page of every document, regardless of the prosecution's proposed use for the prior conviction. <i>Infra,</i> at 403, 407-408. One Member of the majority tries to limit the Court's new rule by arguing that counsel's decision here was \"not the result of an informed tactical decision,\" <i>ante,</i> at 395 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring), but the record gives no support for this notion. The Court also protests that the exceptional weight Rompilla's attorneys at sentencing placed on residual doubt required them to review the prior conviction file, <i>ante,</i> at 389-390; <i>ante,</i> at 394-395 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring). In fact, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*401</span> residual doubt was not central to Rompilla's mitigation case. Rompilla's family members did testify at sentencing that they thought he was innocent, but Dantos tried to draw attention away from this point and instead use the family's testimony to humanize Rompilla and ask for mercy. App. 123-149.</p>\n<p>The majority also disregards the sound strategic calculation supporting the decisions made by Rompilla's attorneys. Charles and Dantos were \"aware of [Rompilla's] priors\" and \"aware of the circumstances\" surrounding these convictions. <i>Id.,</i> at 507. At the post-conviction hearing, Dantos also indicated that she had reviewed documents relating to the prior conviction. <i>Ibid.</i> Based on this information, as well as their numerous conversations with Rompilla and his family, Charles and Dantos reasonably could conclude that reviewing the full prior conviction case file was not the best allocation of resources.</p>\n<p>The majority concludes otherwise only by ignoring <i>Strickland</i>'s command that \"[j]udicial scrutiny of counsel's performance must be highly deferential.\" 466 U. S., at 689. According to the Court, the Constitution required nothing less than a full review of the prior conviction case file by Rompilla's attorneys. Even with the benefit of hindsight the Court struggles to explain how the file would have proved helpful, offering only the vague speculation that Rompilla's attorneys might have discovered \"circumstances extenuating the behavior described by the [rape] victim.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 386. What the Court means by \"circumstances\" is a mystery. If the Court is referring to details on Rompilla's mental fitness or upbringing, surely Rompilla's attorneys were more likely to discover such information through the sources they consulted: Rompilla; his family; and the three mental health experts that examined him.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the circumstances to which the majority refers are the details of Rompilla's 1974 crimes. Charles and Dantos, however, had enough information about the prior <span class=\"star-pagination\">*402</span> convictions to determine that reviewing the case file was not the most effective use of their time. Rompilla had been convicted of breaking into the residence of Josephine Macrenna, who lived in an apartment above the bar she owned. App. 56-89. After Macrenna gave him the bar's receipts for the night, Rompilla demanded that she disrobe. When she initially resisted, Rompilla slashed her left breast with a knife. Rompilla then held Macrenna at knife-point while he raped her for over an hour. Charles and Dantos were aware of these circumstances of the prior conviction and the brutality of the crime. <i>Id.,</i> at 507. It did not take a review of the case file to know that quibbling with the Commonwealth's version of events was a dubious trial strategy. At sentencing Dantos fought vigorously to prevent the Commonwealth from introducing the details of the 1974 crimes, <i>id.,</i> at 16-40, but once the transcript was admitted there was nothing that could be done. Rompilla was unlikely to endear himself to the jury by arguing that his prior conviction for burglary, theft, and rape really was not as bad as the Commonwealth was making it out to be. Recognizing this, Rompilla's attorneys instead devoted their limited time and resources to developing a mitigation case. That those efforts turned up little useful evidence does not make the <i>ex ante</i> strategic calculation of Rompilla's attorneys constitutionally deficient.</p>\n<p>One of the primary reasons this Court has rejected a checklist approach to effective assistance of counsel is that each new requirement risks distracting attorneys from the real objective of providing vigorous advocacy as dictated by the facts and circumstances in the particular case. The Court's rigid requirement that counsel always review the case files of convictions the prosecution seeks to use at trial will be just such a distraction. Capital defendants often have a history of crime. For example, as of 2003, 64 percent of inmates on death row had prior felony convictions. U. S. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, T. Bonczar &amp; T. Snell, Capital Punishment, 2003, p. 8 (Nov. 2004), available <span class=\"star-pagination\">*403</span> at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cp03.pdf (as visited June 16, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). If the prosecution relies on these convictions as aggravators, the Court has now obligated defense attorneys to review the boxes of documents that come with them.</p>\n<p>In imposing this new rule, the Court states that counsel in this case could review the \"entire file\" with \"ease.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 386, n. 4. There is simply no support in the record for this assumption. Case files often comprise numerous boxes. The file may contain, among other things, witness statements, forensic evidence, arrest reports, grand jury transcripts, testimony and exhibits relating to any pretrial suppression hearings, trial transcripts, trial exhibits, post-trial motions, and presentence reports. Full review of even a single prior conviction case file could be time consuming, and many of the documents in a file are duplicative or irrelevant. The Court, recognizing the flaw in its analysis, suggests that cases involving \"warehouses of records\" \"will call for greater subtlety.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Yet for all we know, this is such a case. As to the time component, the Court tells us nothing as to the number of hours counsel had available to prepare for sentencing or why the decisions they made in allocating their time were so flawed as to constitute deficient performance under <i>Strickland.</i></p>\n<p>Today's decision will not increase the resources committed to capital defense. (At the time of Rompilla's trial, the Lehigh County Public Defender's Office had two investigators for 2,000 cases. App. 662.) If defense attorneys dutifully comply with the Court's new rule, they will have to divert resources from other tasks. The net effect of today's holding in many cases \u0097 instances where trial counsel reasonably can conclude that reviewing old case files is not an effective use of time \u0097 will be to diminish the quality of representation. We have \"consistently declined to impose mechanical rules on counsel \u0097 even when those rules might lead to better representation,\" <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Flores-Ortega,</i> 528 U. S., at 481; I see <span class=\"star-pagination\">*404</span> no occasion to depart from this approach in order to impose a requirement that might well lead to worse representation.</p>\n<p>It is quite possible defense attorneys, recognizing the absurdity of a one-size-fits-all approach to effective advocacy, will simply ignore the Court's new requirement and continue to exercise their best judgment about how to allocate time and resources in preparation for trial. While this decision would be understandable \u0097 and might even be required by state ethical rules, cf. Pa. Rules of Professional Conduct, Preamble, and Rule 1.1 (2005) \u0097 it leaves open the possibility that a defendant will seek to overturn his conviction based on something in a prior conviction case file that went unreviewed. This elevation of needle-in-a-haystack claims to the status of constitutional violations will benefit undeserving defendants and saddle States with the considerable costs of retrial and/or resentencing.</p>\n<p>Today's decision is wrong under any standard, but the Court's error is compounded by the fact that this case arises on federal habeas. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court adjudicated Rompilla's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim on the merits, and this means 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254(d)'s deferential standard of review applies. Rompilla must show that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision was not just \"incorrect or erroneous,\" but \"objectively unreasonable.\" <i>Lockyer</i> v. <i>Andrade,</i> 538 U. S. 63, 75 (2003) (citing <i>Williams</i> v. <i>Taylor,</i> 529 U. S. 362, 410, 412 (2000)). He cannot do so.</p>\n<p>The Court pays lipservice to the <i>Williams</i> standard, but it proceeds to adopt a rigid, <i>per se</i> obligation that binds counsel in every case and finds little support in our precedents. Indeed, <i>Strickland,</i> the case the Court purports to apply, is directly to the contrary: \"Most important, in adjudicating a claim of actual ineffectiveness of counsel, a court should keep in mind that the principles we have stated do not establish mechanical rules.\" 466 U. S., at 696. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court gave careful consideration to Rompilla's Sixth Amendment claim and concluded that \"counsel reasonably <span class=\"star-pagination\">*405</span> relied upon their discussions with [Rompilla] and upon their experts to determine the records needed to evaluate his mental health and other potential mitigating circumstances.\" <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Rompilla,</i> 554 Pa. 378, 385-386, 721 A. 2d 786, 790 (1998). This decision was far from unreasonable. The Pennsylvania courts can hardly be faulted for failing to anticipate today's abrupt departure from <i>Strickland.</i></p>\n<p>We have reminded federal courts often of the need to show the requisite level of deference to state-court judgments under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254(d). <i>Holland</i> v. <i>Jackson,</i> 542 U. S. 649 (2004) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>Middleton</i> v. <i>McNeil,</i> 541 U. S. 433 (2004) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>Yarborough</i> v. <i>Gentry,</i> 540 U. S. 1 (2003) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>Mitchell</i> v. <i>Esparza,</i> 540 U. S. 12 (2003) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>Early</i> v. <i>Packer,</i> 537 U. S. 3 (2002) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>Woodford</i> v. <i>Visciotti,</i> 537 U. S. 19 (2002) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> By ignoring our own admonition today, the Court adopts a do-as-we-say, not-as-we-do approach to federal habeas review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Even accepting the Court's misguided analysis of the adequacy of representation by Rompilla's trial counsel, Rompilla is still not entitled to habeas relief. <i>Strickland</i> assigns the defendant the burden of demonstrating prejudice, 466 U. S., at 692. Rompilla cannot satisfy this standard, and only through a remarkable leap can the Court conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p>The Court's theory of prejudice rests on serendipity. Nothing in the old case file diminishes the aggravating nature of the prior conviction. The only way Rompilla's attorneys could have minimized the aggravating force of the earlier rape conviction was through Dantos' forceful, but ultimately unsuccessful, fight to exclude the transcript at sentencing. The Court, recognizing this problem, instead finds prejudice through chance. If Rompilla's attorneys had reviewed the case file of his prior rape and burglary conviction, the Court says, they would have stumbled across \"a range of mitigation leads.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 390.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*406</span> The range of leads to which the Court refers is in fact a handful of notations within a single 10-page document. The document, an \"Initial Transfer Petition,\" appears to have been prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections after Rompilla's conviction to facilitate his initial assignment to one of the Commonwealth's maximum-security prisons. Lodging to App. 31-40.</p>\n<p>Rompilla cannot demonstrate prejudice because nothing in the record indicates that Rompilla's trial attorneys would have discovered the transfer petition, or the clues contained in it, if they had reviewed the old file. The majority faults Rompilla's attorneys for failing to \"learn what the Commonwealth knew about the crime,\" \"discover any mitigating evidence the Commonwealth would downplay,\" and \"anticipate the details of the aggravating evidence the Commonwealth would emphasize.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 385-386. Yet if Rompilla's attorneys had reviewed the case file with these purposes in mind, they almost surely would have attributed no significance to the transfer petition following only a cursory review. The petition, after all, was prepared by the Department of Corrections after Rompilla's conviction for the purpose of determining Rompilla's initial prison assignment. It contained no details regarding the circumstances of the conviction. Reviewing the prior conviction file for information to counter the Commonwealth, counsel would have looked first at the transcript of the trial testimony, and perhaps then to probative exhibits or forensic evidence. There would have been no reason for counsel to read, or even to skim, this obscure document.</p>\n<p>The Court claims that the transfer petition would have been discovered because it was in the \"same file\" with the transcript, <i>ante,</i> at 391, but this characterization is misleading and the conclusion the Court draws from it is accordingly fallacious. The record indicates only that the transfer petition was a part of the same case file, but Rompilla provides no indication of the size of the file, which for all we know <span class=\"star-pagination\">*407</span> originally comprised several boxes of documents. App. 508, 571, 631. By the time of Rompilla's state post-conviction hearing, moreover, the transfer petition was not stored in any \"file\" at all \u0097 it had been transferred to microfilm. <i>Id.,</i> at 461. The Court implies in a footnote that prejudice can be presumed because \"Pennsylvania has conspicuously failed to contest Rompilla's\" inevitable-discovery argument. <i>Ante,</i> at 391, n. 8. The Commonwealth's strategy is unsurprising given that discussion of the prior conviction case file takes up only one paragraph of Rompilla's argument, Brief for Petitioner 35-36, but it is also irrelevant. It is well established that Rompilla, not the Commonwealth, has the burden of establishing prejudice. <i>Strickland, supra,</i> at 694.</p>\n<p>The majority thus finds itself in a bind. If counsel's alleged deficiency lies in the failure to review the file for the purposes the majority has identified, then there is no prejudice: for there is no reasonable probability that review of the file for those purposes would have led counsel to accord the transfer petition enough attention to discover the leads the majority cites. Prejudice could only be demonstrated if the deficiency in counsel's performance were to be described not as the failure to perform a purposive review of the file, but instead as the failure to accord intense scrutiny to every single page of every single document in that file, regardless of the purpose motivating the review. At times, the Court hints that its new obligation on counsel sweeps this broadly. See <i>ante,</i> at 386, n. 4 (\"The ease with which counsel could examine the entire file . . .\"); <i>ante,</i> at 386, n. 5 (\"[C]ounsel had no way of knowing the context of the transcript and the details of the prior conviction without looking at the file as a whole\"). Surely, however, the Court would not require defense counsel to look at every document, no matter how tangential, included in the prior conviction file on the off chance that some notation therein might provide a lead, which in turn might result in the discovery of useful information. The Constitution does not mandate that defense attorneys <span class=\"star-pagination\">*408</span> perform busy work. This rigid requirement would divert counsel's limited time and energy away from more important tasks. In this way, it would ultimately disserve the rationale underlying the Court's new rule, which is to ensure that defense counsel counter the State's aggravation case effectively.</p>\n<p>If the Court does intend to impose on counsel a constitutional obligation to review every page of every document included in the case file of a prior conviction, then today's holding is even more misguided than I imagined.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p><i>Strickland</i> anticipated the temptation \"to second-guess counsel's assistance after conviction or adverse sentence\" and cautioned that \"[a] fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the time.\" 466 U. S., at 689. Today, the Court succumbs to the very temptation that <i>Strickland</i> warned against. In the process, the majority imposes on defense attorneys a rigid requirement that finds no support in our cases or common sense.</p>\n<p>I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for the American Bar Association by <i>Robert J.

If he's charged with committing the Burglary\u0097</p>\n<p>.      .      .      .      .</p>\n<p>\"[PROSECUTOR]: I had a copy, and I forgot to bring it up with me.</p>\n<p>\"[COURT]: All right.</p>\n<p>\"[DEFENSE]: Can we see it, Judge?</p>\n<p>\"[COURT]: Sure, he's going to get it.</p>\n<p>\"[PROSECUTOR]: It's a public record . . . you could have gone over <i>[sic]</i> lunch and looked at it just like I did.\" App. 28.</p>\n<p>[3]  Defense counsel also stated at the postconviction hearing that she believed at some point she had looked at some files regarding that prior conviction and that she was familiar with the particulars of the case. But she could not recall what the files were or how she obtained them. <i>Id.,</i> at 507-508. In addition, counsel apparently obtained Rompilla's rap sheet, which showed that he had prior convictions, including the one for rape. <i>Id.,</i> at 664. At oral argument, the United States, arguing as an <i>amicus</i> in support of Pennsylvania, maintained that counsel had fulfilled their obligations to investigate the prior conviction by obtaining the rap sheet. Tr. of Oral Arg. 44-45. But this cannot be so. The rap sheet would reveal only the charges and dispositions, being no reasonable substitute for the prior conviction file. The dissent nonetheless concludes on this evidence that counsel knew all they needed to know about the prior conviction. <i>Post,</i> at 401 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Given counsel's limited investigation into the prior conviction, the dissent's parsing of the record seems generous to a fault.</p>\n<p>[4]  The ease with which counsel could examine the entire file makes application of this standard correspondingly easy. Suffice it to say that when the State has warehouses of records available in a particular case, review of counsel's performance will call for greater subtlety.</p>\n<p>[5]  This requirement answers the dissent's and the United States's contention that defense counsel provided effective assistance with regard to the prior conviction file because it argued that it would be prejudicial to allow the introduction of the transcript. <i>Post,</i> at 402; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 29. Counsel's obligation to rebut aggravating evidence extended beyond arguing it ought to be kept out. As noted above, <i>supra</i> this page, counsel had no way of knowing the context of the transcript and the details of the prior conviction without looking at the file as a whole. Counsel could not effectively rebut the aggravation case or build their own case in mitigation.\n</p>\n<p>Nor is there any merit to the United States's contention that further enquiry into the prior conviction file would have been fruitless because the sole reason the transcript was being introduced was to establish the aggravator that Rompilla had committed prior violent felonies. Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 30. The Government maintains that because the transcript would incontrovertibly establish the fact that Rompilla had committed a violent felony, the defense could not have expected to rebut that aggravator through further investigation of the file. That analysis ignores the fact that the sentencing jury was required to weigh aggravating factors against mitigating factors. We may reasonably assume that the jury could give more relative weight to a prior violent felony aggravator where defense counsel missed an opportunity to argue that circumstances of the prior conviction were less damning than the prosecution's characterization of the conviction would suggest.</p>\n<p>[6]  The new version of the Standards now reads that any \"investigation should include efforts to secure information in the possession of the prosecution and law enforcement authorities\" whereas the version in effect at the time of Rompilla's trial provided that the \"investigation\" should always include such efforts. ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Prosecution Function and Defense Function 4-4.1 (3d ed. 1993). We see no material difference between these two phrasings, and in any case cannot think of any situation in which defense counsel should not make some effort to learn the information in the possession of the prosecution and law enforcement authorities.</p>\n<p>[7]  In 1989, shortly after Rompilla's trial, the ABA promulgated a set of guidelines specifically devoted to setting forth the obligations of defense counsel in death penalty cases. ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases (1989) (hereinafter 1989 ABA Guidelines or Guideline). Those Guidelines applied the clear requirements for investigation set forth in the earlier Standards to death penalty cases and imposed a similarly forceful directive: \"Counsel should make efforts to secure information in the possession of the prosecution or law enforcement authorities, including police reports.\" Guideline 11.4.1.D.4. When the United States argues that Rompilla's defense counsel complied with these Guidelines, it focuses its attentions on a different Guideline, 11.4.1.D.2. Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 20-21. Guideline 11.4.1.D.2 concerns practices for working with the defendant and potential witnesses, and the United States contends that it imposes no requirement to obtain any one particular type of record or information. <i>Ibid.</i> But this argument ignores the subsequent Guideline quoted above, which is in fact reprinted in the appendix to the United States's brief, that requires counsel to \"`make efforts to secure information in the possession of the prosecution or law enforcement authorities.'\" App. to <i>id.,</i> at 4a.\n</p>\n<p>Later, and current, ABA Guidelines relating to death penalty defense are even more explicit:</p>\n<p>\"Counsel must . . . investigate prior convictions . . . that could be used as aggravating circumstances or otherwise come into evidence. If a prior conviction is legally flawed, counsel should seek to have it set aside. Counsel may also find extenuating circumstances that can be offered to lessen the weight of a conviction.\" ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases 10.7, comment. (rev. ed. 2003), reprinted in 31 Hofstra L. Rev. 913, 1027 (2003) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p>Our decision in <i>Wiggins</i> made precisely the same point in citing the earlier 1989 ABA Guidelines. 539 U. S., at 524 (\"The ABA Guidelines provide that investigations into mitigating evidence `should comprise efforts to discover <i>all reasonably available</i> mitigating evidence and evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced by the prosecutor'\" (quoting 1989 ABA Guideline 11.4.1.C (emphasis in original))). For reasons given in the text, no such further investigation was needed to point to the reasonable duty to look in the file in question here.</p>\n<p>[8]  The dissent would ignore the opportunity to find this evidence on the ground that its discovery (and the consequent analysis of prejudice) \"rests on serendipity,\" <i>post,</i> at 405. But once counsel had an obligation to examine the file, counsel had to make reasonable efforts to learn its contents; and once having done so, they could not reasonably have ignored mitigation evidence or red flags simply because they were unexpected. The dissent, however, assumes that counsel could reasonably decline even to read what was in the file, see <i>post,</i> at 406 (if counsel had reviewed the case file for mitigating evidence, \"[t]here would have been no reason for counsel to read, or even to skim, this obscure document\"). While that could well have been true if counsel had been faced with a large amount of possible evidence, see n. 4, <i>supra,</i> there is no indication that examining the case file in question here would have required significant labor. Indeed, Pennsylvania has conspicuously failed to contest Rompilla's claim that because the information was located in the prior conviction file, reasonable efforts would have led counsel to this information.</p>\n\n</div>",

BEARD, SECRETARY, PENNSYLVANIA\n        DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 04\u20135462. Argued January 18, 2005\u2014Decided June 20, 2005\nPetitioner Rompilla was convicted of murder and other crimes. During\n  the penalty phase, the jury found the aggravating factors that the\n  murder was committed during a felony, that it was committed by tor-\n  ture, and that Rompilla had a significant history of felony convictions\n  indicating the use or threat of violence. In mitigation, five members\n  of Rompilla\u2019s family beseeched the jury for mercy. He was sentenced\n  to death, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed. His new\n  lawyers filed for state postconviction relief, claiming ineffective assis-\n  tance by his trial counsel in failing to present significant mitigating\n  evidence about Rompilla\u2019s childhood, mental capacity and health, and\n  alcoholism. The state courts found that trial counsel had sufficiently\n  investigated the mitigation possibilities. Rompilla then raised inade-\n  quate representation in a federal habeas petition. The District Court\n  found that the State Supreme Court had unreasonably applied\n  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, concluding that trial coun-\n  sel had not investigated obvious signs that Rompilla had a troubled\n  childhood and suffered from mental illness and alcoholism, unjusti-\n  fiably relying instead on Rompilla\u2019s own description of an unexcep-\n  tional background. In reversing, the Third Circuit found nothing un-\n  reasonable in the state court\u2019s application of Strickland, given\n  defense counsel\u2019s efforts to uncover mitigation evidence from Rom-\n  pilla, certain family members, and three mental health experts. The\n  court distinguished Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510\u2014in which coun-\n  sel had failed to investigate adequately to the point of ignoring the\n  leads their limited enquiry yielded\u2014noting that, although trial coun-\n  sel did not unearth useful information in Rompilla\u2019s school, medical,\n  police, and prison records, their investigation had gone far enough to\n2                         ROMPILLA v.

Pp. 4\u201318.\n    (a) Rompilla\u2019s entitlement to federal habeas relief turns on showing\n that the state court\u2019s resolution of his ineffective-assistance claim\n under Strickland \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or in-\n volved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\n law, as determined by\u201d this Court, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). The state\n court\u2019s result must be not only incorrect but also objectively unrea-\n sonable. Wiggins, supra, at 520\u2013521. In judging the defense\u2019s inves-\n tigation in preparing for a capital trial\u2019s sentencing phase, hindsight\n is discounted by pegging adequacy to \u201ccounsel\u2019s perspective at the\n time\u201d investigative decisions were made and by giving deference to\n counsel\u2019s judgments. Strickland, supra, at 689, 691. Pp. 4\u20135.\n    (b) Here, the lawyers were deficient in failing to examine the court\n file on Rompilla\u2019s prior rape and assault conviction. They knew that\n the Commonwealth intended to seek the death penalty by proving\n that Rompilla had a significant history of felony convictions indicat-\n ing the use or threat of violence, that it would attempt to establish\n this history by proving the prior conviction, and that it would empha-\n size his violent character by introducing a transcript of the rape vic-\n tim\u2019s trial testimony. Although the prior conviction file was a public\n record, readily available at the courthouse where Rompilla was to be\n tried, counsel looked at no part of it until warned by the prosecution\n a second time, and even then did not examine the entire file. With\n every effort to view the facts as a defense lawyer would have at the\n time, it is difficult to see how counsel could have failed to realize that\n not examining the file would seriously compromise their opportunity\n to respond to an aggravation case. Their duty to make all reasonable\n efforts to learn what they could about the offense the prosecution was\n going to use certainly included obtaining the Commonwealth\u2019s own\n readily available file to learn what it knew about the crime, to dis-\n cover any mitigating evidence it would downplay, and to anticipate\n the details it would emphasize. The obligation to examine the file\n was particularly pressing here because the violent prior offense was\n similar to the crime charged and because Rompilla\u2019s sentencing\n strategy stressed residual doubt. This obligation is not just common\n sense, but is also described in the American Bar Association Stan-\n dards for Criminal Justice, which are \u201c \u2018guides to determining what is\n reasonable,\u2019 \u201d Wiggins, supra, at 524.

No reasonable lawyer would forgo examination of the file\n  thinking he could do as well by asking the defendant or family rela-\n  tions what they recalled. Nor would a reasonable lawyer compare\n  possible searches for school reports, juvenile records, and evidence of\n  drinking habits to the opportunity to take a look at a file disclosing\n  what the prosecutor knows and plans to read from in his case. Pp. 5\u2013\n  14.\n     (c) Because the state courts found counsel\u2019s representation ade-\n  quate, they never reached the prejudice element of a Strickland\n  claim, whether \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for coun-\n  sel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result . . . would have been different,\u201d\n  466 U. S., at 694. A de novo examination of this element shows that\n  counsel\u2019s lapse was prejudicial. Had they looked at the prior convic-\n  tion file, they would have found a range of mitigation leads that no\n  other source had opened up. The imprisonment records contained in\n  that file pictured Rompilla\u2019s childhood and mental health very differ-\n  ently from anything they had seen or heard. The accumulated en-\n  tries\u2014e.g., that Rompilla had a series of incarcerations, often related\n  to alcohol; and test results that would have pointed the defense\u2019s\n  mental health experts to schizophrenia and other disorders\u2014would\n  have destroyed the benign conception of Rompilla\u2019s upbringing and\n  mental capacity counsel had formed from talking to five family mem-\n  bers and from the mental health experts\u2019 reports. Further effort\n  would presumably have unearthed much of the material postconvic-\n  tion counsel found. Alerted to the school, medical, and prison records\n  that trial counsel never saw, postconviction counsel found red flags\n  pointing up a need for further testing, which revealed organic brain\n  damage and childhood problems probably related to fetal alcohol syn-\n  drome. These findings in turn would probably have prompted a look\n  at easily available school and juvenile records, which showed addi-\n  tional problems, including evidence of a highly abusive home life.\n  The evidence adds up to a mitigation case bearing no relation to the\n  few naked pleas for mercy actually put before the jury. The undis-\n  covered \u201cmitigating evidence, taken as a whole, \u2018might well have in-\n  fluenced the jury\u2019s appraisal\u2019 of [Rompilla\u2019s] culpability,\u201d Wiggins,\n  supra, at 538, and the likelihood of a different result had the evidence\n  gone in is \u201csufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\u201d actu-\n  ally reached at sentencing, Strickland, supra, at 694.

JEFFREY A.\n     BEARD, SECRETARY, PENNSYLVANIA\n       DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n                                 [June 20, 2005]\n\n  JUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case calls for specific application of the standard of\nreasonable competence required on the part of defense\ncounsel by the Sixth Amendment. We hold that even\nwhen a capital defendant\u2019s family members and the de-\nfendant himself have suggested that no mitigating evi-\ndence is available, his lawyer is bound to make reasonable\nefforts to obtain and review material that counsel knows\nthe prosecution will probably rely on as evidence of aggra-\nvation at the sentencing phase of trial.\n                             I\n  On the morning of January 14, 1988, James Scanlon\nwas discovered dead in a bar he ran in Allentown, Penn-\nsylvania, his body having been stabbed repeatedly and set\non fire. Rompilla was indicted for the murder and related\noffenses, and the Commonwealth gave notice of intent to\nask for the death penalty. Two public defenders were\nassigned to the case.\n  The jury at the guilt phase of trial found Rompilla guilty\non all counts, and during the ensuing penalty phase, the\n2                    ROMPILLA v. BEARD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprosecutor sought to prove three aggravating factors to\njustify a death sentence: that the murder was committed\nin the course of another felony; that the murder was com-\nmitted by torture; and that Rompilla had a significant\nhistory of felony convictions indicating the use or threat of\nviolence. See 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7\u00a79711(d)(6), (8), (9)\n(2002). The Commonwealth presented evidence on all\nthree aggravators, and the jury found all proven. Rom-\npilla\u2019s evidence in mitigation consisted of relatively brief\ntestimony: five of his family members argued in effect for\nresidual doubt, and beseeched the jury for mercy, saying\nthat they believed Rompilla was innocent and a good man.\nRompilla\u2019s 14-year-old son testified that he loved his\nfather and would visit him in prison. The jury acknowl-\nedged this evidence to the point of finding, as two factors\nin mitigation, that Rompilla\u2019s son had testified on his\nbehalf and that rehabilitation was possible. But the jurors\nassigned the greater weight to the aggravating factors,\nand sentenced Rompilla to death. The Supreme Court of\nPennsylvania affirmed both conviction and sentence.\nCommonwealth v. Rompilla, 539 Pa. 499, 653 A. 2d 626\n(1995).\n   In December 1995, with new lawyers, Rompilla filed\nclaims under the Pennsylvania Post Conviction Relief Act,\n42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a79541 et seq. (2004), including ineffec-\ntive assistance by trial counsel in failing to present signifi-\ncant mitigating evidence about Rompilla\u2019s childhood,\nmental capacity and health, and alcoholism. The postcon-\nviction court found that trial counsel had done enough to\ninvestigate the possibilities of a mitigation case, and the\nSupreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the denial of\nrelief. Commonwealth v. Rompilla, 554 Pa. 378, 721 A. 2d\n786 (1998).\n   Rompilla then petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus\nunder 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254 in Federal District Court, raising\nclaims that included inadequate representation. The\n                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nDistrict Court found that the State Supreme Court had\nunreasonably applied Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.\n668 (1984), as to the penalty phase of the trial, and\ngranted relief for ineffective assistance of counsel. The\ncourt found that in preparing the mitigation case the de-\nfense lawyers had failed to investigate \u201cpretty obvious\nsigns\u201d that Rompilla had a troubled childhood and suf-\nfered from mental illness and alcoholism, and instead had\nrelied unjustifiably on Rompilla\u2019s own description of an\nunexceptional background.          Rompilla v. Horn, No.\nCIV.A.99\u2013737 (ED Pa., July 11, 2000), App. 1307\u20131308.\n  A divided Third Circuit panel reversed. Rompilla v.\nHorn, 355 F. 3d 233 (2004). The majority found nothing\nunreasonable in the state court\u2019s application of Strickland,\ngiven defense counsel\u2019s efforts to uncover mitigation mate-\nrial, which included interviewing Rompilla and certain\nfamily members, as well as consultation with three mental\nhealth experts. Although the majority noted that the\nlawyers did not unearth the \u201cuseful information\u201d to be\nfound in Rompilla\u2019s \u201cschool, medical, police, and prison\nrecords,\u201d it thought the lawyers were justified in failing to\nhunt through these records when their other efforts gave\nno reason to believe the search would yield anything\nhelpful. 355 F. 3d, at 252. The panel thus distinguished\nRompilla\u2019s case from Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510\n(2003). Whereas Wiggins\u2019s counsel failed to investigate\nadequately, to the point even of ignoring the leads their\nlimited enquiry yielded, the Court of Appeals saw the Rom-\npilla investigation as going far enough to leave counsel with\nreason for thinking further efforts would not be a wise use of\nthe limited resources they had. But Judge Sloviter\u2019s dissent\nstressed that trial counsel\u2019s failure to obtain relevant re-\ncords on Rompilla\u2019s background was owing to the lawyers\u2019\nunreasonable reliance on family members and medical\nexperts to tell them what records might be useful. The\nThird Circuit denied rehearing en banc by a vote of 6 to 5.\n4                       ROMPILLA v. BEARD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nRompilla v.

C. \u00a72254, Rompilla\u2019s entitlement to\nfederal habeas relief turns on showing that the state\ncourt\u2019s resolution of his claim of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel under Strickland v.

An \u201cunreasonable application\u201d occurs when a\nstate court \u201c \u2018identifies the correct governing legal princi-\nple from this Court\u2019s decisions but unreasonably applies\nthat principle to the facts\u2019 of petitioner\u2019s case.\u201d Wiggins v.\nSmith, supra, at 520 (quoting Williams v. Taylor, 529\nU. S. 362, 413 (2000) (opinion of O\u2019CONNOR, J.)). That is,\n\u201cthe state court\u2019s decision must have been [not only] incor-\nrect or erroneous [but] objectively unreasonable.\u201d Wiggins\nv. Smith, supra, at 520\u2013521 (quoting Williams v.

This case, like some others recently, looks\nto norms of adequate investigation in preparing for the\nsentencing phase of a capital trial, when defense counsel\u2019s\njob is to counter the State\u2019s evidence of aggravated culpa-\nbility with evidence in mitigation.

S., at 689, and by giving a \u201cheavy measure of defer-\nence to counsel\u2019s judgments,\u201d id., at 691.\n                              A\n  A standard of reasonableness applied as if one stood in\ncounsel\u2019s shoes spawns few hard-edged rules, and the\nmerits of a number of counsel\u2019s choices in this case are\nsubject to fair debate. This is not a case in which defense\ncounsel simply ignored their obligation to find mitigating\nevidence, and their workload as busy public defenders did\nnot keep them from making a number of efforts, including\ninterviews with Rompilla and some members of his family,\nand examinations of reports by three mental health ex-\nperts who gave opinions at the guilt phase. None of the\nsources proved particularly helpful.\n  Rompilla\u2019s own contributions to any mitigation case\nwere minimal. Counsel found him uninterested in help-\ning, as on their visit to his prison to go over a proposed\nmitigation strategy, when Rompilla told them he was\n\u201cbored being here listening\u201d and returned to his cell. App.\n668. To questions about childhood and schooling, his\nanswers indicated they had been normal, ibid., save for\nquitting school in the ninth grade, id., at 677. There were\ntimes when Rompilla was even actively obstructive by\nsending counsel off on false leads. Id., at 663\u2013664.\n  The lawyers also spoke with five members of Rompilla\u2019s\nfamily (his former wife, two brothers, a sister-in-law, and\nhis son), id., at 494, and counsel testified that they devel-\noped a good relationship with the family in the course of\ntheir representation. Id., at 669, 729. The state postcon-\nviction court found that counsel spoke to the relatives in a\n\u201cdetailed manner,\u201d attempting to unearth mitigating\ninformation, id., at 264, although the weight of this find-\n6                    ROMPILLA v. BEARD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning is qualified by the lawyers\u2019 concession that \u201cthe over-\nwhelming response from the family was that they didn\u2019t\nreally feel as though they knew him all that well since he\nhad spent the majority of his adult years and some of his\nchildhood years in custody,\u201d id., at 495; see also id., at 669.\nDefense counsel also said that because the family was\n\u201ccoming from the position that [Rompilla] was innocent . . .\nthey weren\u2019t looking for reasons for why he might have\ndone this.\u201d Id., at 494.\n   The third and final source tapped for mitigating mate-\nrial was the cadre of three mental health witnesses who\nwere asked to look into Rompilla\u2019s mental state as of the\ntime of the offense and his competency to stand trial. Id.,\nat 473\u2013474, 476, but their reports revealed \u201cnothing use-\nful\u201d to Rompilla\u2019s case, id., at 1358, and the lawyers con-\nsequently did not go to any other historical source that\nmight have cast light on Rompilla\u2019s mental condition.\n   When new counsel entered the case to raise Rompilla\u2019s\npostconviction claims, however, they identified a number\nof likely avenues the trial lawyers could fruitfully have\nfollowed in building a mitigation case. School records are\none example, which trial counsel never examined in spite\nof the professed unfamiliarity of the several family mem-\nbers with Rompilla\u2019s childhood, and despite counsel\u2019s\nknowledge that Rompilla left school after the ninth grade.\nId., at 677. Others examples are records of Rompilla\u2019s\njuvenile and adult incarcerations, which counsel did not\nconsult, although they were aware of their client\u2019s crimi-\nnal record. And while counsel knew from police reports\nprovided in pretrial discovery that Rompilla had been\ndrinking heavily at the time of his offense, Lodging to App.\n111\u2013120 (hereinafter Lodging), and although one of the\nmental health experts reported that Rompilla\u2019s troubles\nwith alcohol merited further investigation, App. 723\u2013724,\ncounsel did not look for evidence of a history of dependence\non alcohol that might have extenuating significance.\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Before us, trial counsel and the Commonwealth respond\nto these unexplored possibilities by emphasizing this\nCourt\u2019s recognition that the duty to investigate does not\nforce defense lawyers to scour the globe on the off-chance\nsomething will turn up; reasonably diligent counsel may\ndraw a line when they have good reason to think further\ninvestigation would be a waste. See Wiggins v. Smith, 539\nU. S., at 525 (further investigation excusable where coun-\nsel has evidence suggesting it would be fruitless); Strick-\nland v. Washington, supra, at 699 (counsel could \u201crea-\nsonably surmise . . . that character and psychological\nevidence would be of little help\u201d); Burger v. Kemp, 483\nU. S. 776, 794 (1987) (limited investigation reasonable\nbecause all witnesses brought to counsel\u2019s attention pro-\nvided predominantly harmful information). The Com-\nmonwealth argues that the information trial counsel\ngathered from Rompilla and the other sources gave them\nsound reason to think it would have been pointless to\nspend time and money on the additional investigation\nespoused by postconviction counsel, and we can say that\nthere is room for debate about trial counsel\u2019s obligation to\nfollow at least some of those potential lines of enquiry.\nThere is no need to say more, however, for a further point\nis clear and dispositive: the lawyers were deficient\nin failing to examine the court file on Rompilla\u2019s prior\nconviction.\n                             B\n  There is an obvious reason that the failure to examine\nRompilla\u2019s prior conviction file fell below the level of rea-\nsonable performance. Counsel knew that the Common-\nwealth intended to seek the death penalty by proving\nRompilla had a significant history of felony convictions\nindicating the use or threat of violence, an aggravator\nunder state law. Counsel further knew that the Com-\nmonwealth would attempt to establish this history by\n8                        ROMPILLA v.

App. 665\u2013666. There is no question that\ndefense counsel were on notice, since they acknowledge\nthat a \u201cplea letter,\u201d written by one of them four days prior\nto trial, mentioned the prosecutor\u2019s plans. Ibid. It is also\nundisputed that the prior conviction file was a public\ndocument, readily available for the asking at the very\ncourthouse where Rompilla was to be tried.\n  It is clear, however, that defense counsel did not look at\nany part of that file, including the transcript, until warned\nby the prosecution a second time. In a colloquy the day\nbefore the evidentiary sentencing phase began, the prose-\ncutor again said he would present the transcript of the\nvictim\u2019s testimony to establish the prior conviction.\n            \u201c[DEFENSE]: I would also like to review whatever\n         he\u2019s going to read from.\n            \u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Well, I told you that I was going\n         to do this a long time ago.

The prosecution was going to use the dramatic facts\nof a similar prior offense, and Rompilla\u2019s counsel had a\nduty to make all reasonable efforts to learn what they\ncould about the offense. Reasonable efforts certainly\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n          .            .            .             .           .\n   \u201c[PROSECUTOR] I had a copy, and I forgot to bring it up with me.\n   \u201c[COURT]: All right.\n   \u201c[DEFENSE]: Can we see it, Judge?\n   \u201c[COURT]: Sure, he\u2019s going to get it.\n   \u201c[PROSECUTOR]: It\u2019s a public record . . . you could have gone over\n[sic] lunch and looked at it just like I did.\u201d App. 28.\n   3 Defense counsel also stated at the postconviction hearing that she\n\nbelieved at some point she had looked at some files regarding that prior\nconviction and that she was familiar with the particulars of the case. But\nshe could not recall what the files were or how she obtained them. Id., at\n507\u2013508. In addition, counsel apparently obtained Rompilla\u2019s rap sheet,\nwhich showed that he had prior convictions, including the one for rape.\nId., at 664. At oral argument, the United States, arguing as an amicus in\nsupport of Pennsylvania, maintained that counsel had fulfilled their\nobligations to investigate the prior conviction by obtaining the rap\nsheet. Tr. of Oral Arg. 44\u201345. But this cannot be so. The rap sheet\nwould reveal only the charges and dispositions, being no reasonable\nsubstitute for the prior conviction file. The dissent nonetheless con-\ncludes on this evidence that counsel knew all they needed to know\nabout the prior conviction. Post, at 6 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Given\ncounsel\u2019s limited investigation into the prior conviction, the dissent\u2019s\nparsing of the record seems generous to a fault.\n10                       ROMPILLA v. BEARD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nincluded obtaining the Commonwealth\u2019s own readily\navailable file on the prior conviction to learn what the\nCommonwealth knew about the crime, to discover any\nmitigating evidence the Commonwealth would downplay\nand to anticipate the details of the aggravating evidence\nthe Commonwealth would emphasize.4 Without making\nreasonable efforts to review the file, defense counsel could\nhave had no hope of knowing whether the prosecution was\nquoting selectively from the transcript, or whether there\nwere circumstances extenuating the behavior described by\nthe victim. The obligation to get the file was particularly\npressing here owing to the similarity of the violent prior\noffense to the crime charged and Rompilla\u2019s sentencing\nstrategy stressing residual doubt. Without making efforts\nto learn the details and rebut the relevance of the earlier\ncrime, a convincing argument for residual doubt was\ncertainly beyond any hope.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The ease with which counsel could examine the entire file makes\n\napplication of this standard correspondingly easy. Suffice it to say that\nwhen the State has warehouses of records available in a particular\ncase, review of counsel\u2019s performance will call for greater subtlety.\n   5 This requirement answers the dissent\u2019s and the United States\u2019s con-\n\ntention that defense counsel provided effective assistance with regard to\nthe prior conviction file because it argued that it would be prejudicial to\nallow the introduction of the transcript. Post, at 10; Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 29. Counsel\u2019s obligation to rebut aggravating\nevidence extended beyond arguing it ought to be kept out. As noted\nabove, supra, this page, counsel had no way of knowing the context of\nthe transcript and the details of the prior conviction without looking at\nthe file as a whole. Counsel could not effectively rebut the aggravation\ncase or build their own case in mitigation.\n   Nor is there any merit to the United States\u2019s contention that further\nenquiry into the prior conviction file would have been fruitless because\nthe sole reason the transcript was being introduced was to establish the\naggravator that Rompilla had committed prior violent felonies. Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 30. The Government maintains\nthat because the transcript would incontrovertibly establish the fact\nthat Rompilla had committed a violent felony, the defense could not\nhave expected to rebut that aggravator through further investigation of\n                     Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   The notion that defense counsel must obtain informa-\ntion that the State has and will use against the defendant\nis not simply a matter of common sense. As the District\nCourt points out, the American Bar Association Standards\nfor Criminal Justice in circulation at the time of Rom-\npilla\u2019s trial describes the obligation in terms no one could\nmisunderstand in the circumstances of a case like this\none:\n     \u201cIt is the duty of the lawyer to conduct a prompt in-\n     vestigation of the circumstances of the case and to ex-\n     plore all avenues leading to facts relevant to the mer-\n     its of the case and the penalty in the event of\n     conviction. The investigation should always include\n     efforts to secure information in the possession of the\n     prosecution and law enforcement authorities. The\n     duty to investigate exists regardless of the accused\u2019s\n     admissions or statements to the lawyer of facts consti-\n     tuting guilt or the accused\u2019s stated desire to plead\n     guilty.\u201d 1 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 4\u20134.1\n     (2d ed. 1982 Supp.).6\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe file. That analysis ignores the fact that the sentencing jury was\nrequired to weigh aggravating factors against mitigating factors. We\nmay reasonably assume that the jury could give more relative weight to\na prior violent felony aggravator where defense counsel missed an\nopportunity to argue that circumstances of the prior conviction were\nless damning than the prosecution\u2019s characterization of the conviction\nwould suggest.\n   6 The new version of the Standards now reads that any \u201cinvestigation\n\nshould include efforts to secure information in the possession of the\nprosecution and law enforcement authorities\u201d whereas the version in\neffect at the time of Rompilla\u2019s trial provided that the \u201cinvestigation\u201d\nshould always include such efforts. ABA Standards for Criminal\nJustice, Prosecution Function and Defense Function 4\u20134.1, (3d ed.\n1993). We see no material difference between these two phrasings, and\nin any case cannot think of any situation in which defense counsel\nshould not make some effort to learn the information in the possession\nof the prosecution and law enforcement authorities.\n12                        ROMPILLA v. BEARD\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n \u201c[W]e long have referred [to these ABA Standards] as\n\u2018guides to determining what is reasonable.\u2019 \u201d Wiggins v.\nSmith, 539 U. S., at 524 (quoting Strickland v. Washing-\nton, 466 U. S., at 688), and the Commonwealth has come\nup with no reason to think the quoted standard imperti-\nnent here.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 In 1989, shortly after Rompilla\u2019s trial, the ABA promulgated a set of\nguidelines specifically devoted to setting forth the obligations of defense\ncounsel in death penalty cases. ABA Guidelines for the Appointment\nand Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases (1989) (hereinafter\nABA Guidelines or Guideline). Those Guidelines applied the clear\nrequirements for investigation set forth in the earlier Standards to\ndeath penalty cases and imposed a similarly forceful directive: \u201cCounsel\nshould make efforts to secure information in the possession of the\nprosecution or law enforcement authorities, including police reports.\u201d\nGuideline 11.4.1.D.4. When the United States argues that Rompilla\u2019s\ndefense counsel complied with these Guidelines, it focuses its attentions\non a different Guideline, 11.4.1.D.2. Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 20\u201321. Guideline 11.4.1.D.2 concerns practices for working with\nthe defendant and potential witnesses, and the United States contends\nthat it imposes no requirement to obtain any one particular type of\nrecord or information. Ibid. But this argument ignores the subsequent\nGuideline quoted above, which is in fact reprinted in the appendix to\nthe United States\u2019s brief, that requires counsel to \u201c \u2018make efforts to\nsecure information in the possession of the prosecution or law enforce-\nment authorities.\u2019 \u201d App. to id., at 4a.\n   Later, and current, ABA Guidelines relating to death penalty defense\nare even more explicit:\n   \u201cCounsel must . . . investigate prior convictions . . . that could be used\nas aggravating circumstances or otherwise come into evidence. If a\nprior conviction is legally flawed, counsel should seek to have it set\naside. Counsel may also find extenuating circumstances that can be\noffered to lessen the weight of a conviction.\u201d ABA Guidelines for the\nAppointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty\nCases \u00a710.7, comment.

Tr. of Oral Arg. 37\u201339, 45\u201346. And that, of course, is\nthe position taken by the state postconviction courts.\nWithout specifically discussing the prior case file, they too\nfound that defense counsel\u2019s efforts were enough to free\nthem from any obligation to enquire further. Common-\nwealth v. Rompilla, No. 682/1988 (Pa. Ct. Common Pleas,\nAug. 23, 1996), App. 263\u2013264, 272\u2013273.\n   We think this conclusion of the state court fails to an-\nswer the considerations we have set out, to the point of\nbeing an objectively unreasonable conclusion. It flouts\nprudence to deny that a defense lawyer should try to look\nat a file he knows the prosecution will cull for aggravating\nevidence, let alone when the file is sitting in the trial\ncourthouse, open for the asking. No reasonable lawyer\nwould forgo examination of the file thinking he could do as\nwell by asking the defendant or family relations whether\nthey recalled anything helpful or damaging in the prior\nvictim\u2019s testimony. Nor would a reasonable lawyer com-\npare possible searches for school reports, juvenile records,\nand evidence of drinking habits to the opportunity to take\na look at a file disclosing what the prosecutor knows and\neven plans to read from in his case. Questioning a few\nmore family members and searching for old records can\npromise less than looking for a needle in a haystack, when\na lawyer truly has reason to doubt there is any needle\nthere. E.g., Strickland, 466 U. S., at 699. But looking at a\nfile the prosecution says it will use is a sure bet: whatever\nmay be in that file is going to tell defense counsel some-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nprosecutor\u2019 \u201d (quoting 1989 ABA Guideline 11.4.1.C (emphasis in origi-\nnal))). For reasons given in the text, no such further investigation was\nneeded to point to the reasonable duty to look in the file in question here.\n14                   ROMPILLA v. BEARD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthing about what the prosecution can produce.\n   The dissent thinks this analysis creates a \u201crigid, per se\u201d\nrule that requires defense counsel to do a complete review\nof the file on any prior conviction introduced, post, at 9\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.), but that is a mistake. Counsel\nfell short here because they failed to make reasonable\nefforts to review the prior conviction file, despite knowing\nthat the prosecution intended to introduce Rompilla\u2019s prior\nconviction not merely by entering a notice of conviction\ninto evidence but by quoting damaging testimony of the\nrape victim in that case.       The unreasonableness of at-\ntempting no more than they did was heightened by the\neasy availability of the file at the trial courthouse, and the\ngreat risk that testimony about a similar violent crime\nwould hamstring counsel\u2019s chosen defense of residual\ndoubt. It is owing to these circumstances that the state\ncourts were objectively unreasonable in concluding that\ncounsel could reasonably decline to make any effort to\nreview the file. Other situations, where a defense lawyer\nis not charged with knowledge that the prosecutor intends\nto use a prior conviction in this way, might well warrant a\ndifferent assessment.\n                              C\n   Since counsel\u2019s failure to look at the file fell below the\nline of reasonable practice, there is a further question\nabout prejudice, that is, whether \u201cthere is a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors,\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d\n466 U. S., at 694. Because the state courts found the\nrepresentation adequate, they never reached the issue of\nprejudice, App. 265, 272\u2013273, and so we examine this\nelement of the Strickland claim de novo, Wiggins v. Smith,\nsupra, at 534, and agree with the dissent in the Court of\nAppeals. We think Rompilla has shown beyond any doubt\nthat counsel\u2019s lapse was prejudicial; Pennsylvania, indeed,\n                     Cite as: 545 U.

In the same file with the transcript of the\nprior trial were the records of Rompilla\u2019s imprisonment on\nthe earlier conviction, App. 508, 571, 631, which defense\ncounsel testified she had never seen, id., at 508. The\nprison files pictured Rompilla\u2019s childhood and mental\nhealth very differently from anything defense counsel had\nseen or heard. An evaluation by a corrections counselor\nstates that Rompilla was \u201creared in the slum environment\nof Allentown, Pa. vicinity. He early came to the attention\nof juvenile authorities, quit school at 16, [and] started a\nseries of incarcerations in and out Penna. often of assaul-\ntive nature and commonly related to over-indulgence in\nalcoholic beverages.\u201d Lodging 40. The same file discloses\ntest results that the defense\u2019s mental health experts would\nhave viewed as pointing to schizophrenia and other disor-\nders, and test scores showing a third grade level of cogni-\ntion after nine years of schooling. Id., at 32\u201335.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The dissent would ignore the opportunity to find this evidence on\n\nthe ground that its discovery (and the consequent analysis of prejudice)\n\u201crests on serendipity,\u201d post, at 10. But once counsel had an obligation\nto examine the file, counsel had to make reasonable efforts to learn its\ncontents; and once having done so, they could not reasonably have\nignored mitigation evidence or red flags simply because they were\nunexpected. The dissent, however, assumes that counsel could rea-\nsonably decline even to read what was in the file, see post, at 12 (if\ncounsel had reviewed the case file for mitigating evidence, \u201c[t]here\nwould have been no reason for counsel to read, or even to skim, this\nobscure document\u201d). While that could well have been true if counsel\nhad been faced with a large amount of possible evidence, see n.4, supra,\nthere is no indication that examining the case file in question here\nwould have required significant labor. Indeed, Pennsylvania has\nconspicuously failed to contest Rompilla\u2019s claim that because the\ninformation was located in the prior conviction file, reasonable efforts\nwould have led counsel to this information.\n16                   ROMPILLA v. BEARD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  The accumulated entries would have destroyed the\nbenign conception of Rompilla\u2019s upbringing and mental\ncapacity defense counsel had formed from talking with\nRompilla himself and some of his family members, and\nfrom the reports of the mental health experts. With this\ninformation, counsel would have become skeptical of the\nimpression given by the five family members and would\nunquestionably have gone further to build a mitigation\ncase. Further effort would presumably have unearthed\nmuch of the material postconviction counsel found, includ-\ning testimony from several members of Rompilla\u2019s family,\nwhom trial counsel did not interview. Judge Sloviter\nsummarized this evidence:\n     \u201cRompilla\u2019s parents were both severe alcoholics who\n     drank constantly. His mother drank during her preg-\n     nancy with Rompilla, and he and his brothers eventu-\n     ally developed serious drinking problems. His father,\n     who had a vicious temper, frequently beat Rompilla\u2019s\n     mother, leaving her bruised and black-eyed, and\n     bragged about his cheating on her. His parents\n     fought violently, and on at least one occasion his\n     mother stabbed his father. He was abused by his fa-\n     ther who beat him when he was young with his hands,\n     fists, leather straps, belts and sticks. All of the chil-\n     dren lived in terror. There were no expressions of pa-\n     rental love, affection or approval. Instead, he was\n     subjected to yelling and verbal abuse. His father\n     locked Rompilla and his brother Richard in a small\n     wire mesh dog pen that was filthy and excrement\n     filled. He had an isolated background, and was not al-\n     lowed to visit other children or to speak to anyone on\n     the phone. They had no indoor plumbing in the\n     house, he slept in the attic with no heat, and the chil-\n     dren were not given clothes and attended school in\n     rags.\u201d 355 F. 3d, at 279 (citations omitted) (dissenting\n                  Cite as: 545 U.

While they found \u201cnothing helpful to [Rompilla\u2019s]\ncase,\u201d Rompilla, 544 Pa., at 385, 721 A. 2d, at 790, their\npostconviction counterparts, alerted by information from\nschool, medical, and prison records that trial counsel never\nsaw, found plenty of \u201c \u2018red flags\u2019 \u201d pointing up a need to test\nfurther. 355 F. 3d, at 279 (Sloviter, J., dissenting). When\nthey tested, they found that Rompilla \u201csuffers from organic\nbrain damage, an extreme mental disturbance significantly\nimpairing several of his cognitive functions.\u201d Ibid. They also\nsaid that \u201cRompilla\u2019s problems relate back to his childhood,\nand were likely caused by fetal alcohol syndrome [and that]\nRompilla\u2019s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his\nconduct or to conform his conduct to the law was substan-\ntially impaired at the time of the offense.\u201d Id., at 280\n(Sloviter, J., dissenting).\n   These findings in turn would probably have prompted a\nlook at school and juvenile records, all of them easy to get,\nshowing, for example, that when Rompilla was 16 his\nmother \u201cwas missing from home frequently for a period of\none or several weeks at a time.\u201d Lodging 44. The same\nreport noted that his mother \u201chas been reported . . . fre-\nquently under the influence of alcoholic beverages, with\nthe result that the children have always been poorly kept\nand on the filthy side which was also the condition of the\nhome at all times.\u201d Ibid. School records showed Rom-\npilla\u2019s IQ was in the mentally retarded range. Id., at 11,\n13, 15.\n   This evidence adds up to a mitigation case that bears no\nrelation to the few naked pleas for mercy actually put\nbefore the jury, and although we suppose it is possible that\na jury could have heard it all and still have decided on the\ndeath penalty, that is not the test. It goes without saying\n18                  ROMPILLA v.

The dis-\nsent worries that the Court\u2019s opinion \u201cimposes on defense\ncounsel a rigid requirement to review all documents in\nwhat it calls the \u2018case file\u2019 of any prior conviction that the\nprosecution might rely on at trial.\u201d Post, at 1 (opinion of\nKENNEDY, J.). But the Court\u2019s opinion imposes no such\nrule. See ante, at 14. Rather, today\u2019s decision simply\napplies our longstanding case-by-case approach to deter-\nmining whether an attorney\u2019s performance was unconsti-\ntutionally deficient under Strickland v. Washington, 466\nU. S. 668 (1984). Trial counsel\u2019s performance in Rompilla\u2019s\ncase falls short under that standard, because the attor-\nneys\u2019 behavior was not \u201creasonable considering all the\ncircumstances.\u201d Id., at 688. In particular, there were\nthree circumstances which made the attorneys\u2019 failure to\nexamine Rompilla\u2019s prior conviction file unreasonable.\n   First, Rompilla\u2019s attorneys knew that their client\u2019s prior\nconviction would be at the very heart of the prosecution\u2019s\ncase. The prior conviction went not to a collateral matter,\nbut rather to one of the aggravating circumstances making\nRompilla eligible for the death penalty. The prosecutors\nintended not merely to mention the fact of prior convic-\ntion, but to read testimony about the details of the crime.\n2                   ROMPILLA v. BEARD\n\n                   O\u2019CONNOR, J., concurring\n\nThat crime, besides being quite violent in its own right,\nwas very similar to the murder for which Rompilla was on\ntrial, and Rompilla had committed the murder at issue a\nmere three months after his release from prison on the\nearlier conviction. In other words, the prosecutor clearly\nplanned to use details of the prior crime as powerful evi-\ndence that Rompilla was a dangerous man for whom the\ndeath penalty would be both appropriate punishment and\na necessary means of incapacitation. Cf. App. 165\u2013166\n(prosecutor\u2019s penalty-phase argument). This was evidence\nthe defense should have been prepared to meet: A reason-\nable defense lawyer would have attached a high impor-\ntance to obtaining the record of the prior trial, in order to\nanticipate and find ways of deflecting the prosecutor\u2019s\naggravation argument.\n   Second, the prosecutor\u2019s planned use of the prior convic-\ntion threatened to eviscerate one of the defense\u2019s primary\nmitigation arguments. Rompilla was convicted on the\nbasis of strong circumstantial evidence. His lawyers\nstructured the entire mitigation argument around the\nhope of convincing the jury that residual doubt about\nRompilla\u2019s guilt made it inappropriate to impose the death\npenalty. In announcing an intention to introduce testi-\nmony about Rompilla\u2019s similar prior offense, the prosecu-\ntor put Rompilla\u2019s attorneys on notice that the prospective\ndefense on mitigation likely would be ineffective and\ncounterproductive.    The similarities between the two\ncrimes, combined with the timing and the already strong\ncircumstantial evidence, raised a strong likelihood that\nthe jury would reject Rompilla\u2019s residual doubt argument.\nRompilla\u2019s attorneys\u2019 reliance on this transparently weak\nargument risked damaging their credibility. Such a sce-\nnario called for further investigation, to determine\nwhether circumstances of the prior case gave any hope of\nsaving the residual doubt argument, or whether the best\nstrategy instead would be to jettison that argument so as\n                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)             3\n\n                    O\u2019CONNOR, J., concurring\n\nto focus on other, more promising issues. Cf. Yarborough\nv. Gentry, 540 U. S. 1, 7 (2003) (per curiam); Bell v. Cone,\n535 U. S. 685, 700 (2002) (noting that sound tactical judg-\nment may sometimes call for omitting certain defense evi-\ndence or arguments).\n    Third, the attorneys\u2019 decision not to obtain Rompilla\u2019s\nprior conviction file was not the result of an informed\ntactical decision about how the lawyers\u2019 time would best\nbe spent. Although Rompilla\u2019s attorneys had ample warn-\ning that the details of Rompilla\u2019s prior conviction would be\ncritical to their case, their failure to obtain that file would\nnot necessarily have been deficient if it had resulted from\nthe lawyers\u2019 careful exercise of judgment about how best\nto marshal their time and serve their client. But Rom-\npilla\u2019s attorneys did not ignore the prior case file in order\nto spend their time on other crucial leads. They did not\ndetermine that the file was so inaccessible or so large that\nexamining it would necessarily divert them from other\ntrial-preparation tasks they thought more promising.\nThey did not learn at the 11th hour about the prosecu-\ntion\u2019s intent to use the prior conviction, when it was too\nlate for them to change plans. Rather, their failure to\nobtain the crucial file \u201cwas the result of inattention, not\nreasoned strategic judgment.\u201d Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S.\n510, 534 (2003). As a result, their conduct fell below con-\nstitutionally required standards.           See id., at 533\n(\u201c \u2018[S]trategic choices made after less than complete inves-\ntigation are reasonable\u2019 only to the extent that \u2018reasonable\nprofessional judgments support the limitations on investi-\ngation\u2019 \u201d (quoting Strickland, 466 U.

Washington,\n466 U. S. 668, 690 (1984)\u2014because they did not look in an\nold case file and stumble upon something they had not set\nout to find. By implication the Court also labels incompe-\ntent the work done by the three mental health profession-\nals who examined Ronald Rompilla. To reach this result,\nthe majority imposes on defense counsel a rigid require-\nment to review all documents in what it calls the \u201ccase\nfile\u201d of any prior conviction that the prosecution might rely\non at trial. The Court\u2019s holding, a mistake under any\nstandard of review, is all the more troubling because this\ncase arises under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996. In order to grant Rompilla habeas\nrelief the Court must say, and indeed does say, that the\nPennsylvania Supreme Court was objectively unreason-\nable in failing to anticipate today\u2019s new case file rule.\n   In my respectful submission it is this Court, not the\nstate court, which is unreasonable. The majority\u2019s holding\nhas no place in our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence and,\n2                   ROMPILLA v. BEARD\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nif followed, often will result in less effective counsel by\ndiverting limited defense resources from other important\ntasks in order to satisfy the Court\u2019s new per se rule. Fi-\nnally, even if the Court could justify its distortion of\nStrickland, Rompilla still would not be entitled to relief.\nThe Court is able to conclude otherwise only by ignoring\nthe established principle that it is the defendant, not the\nState, who has the burden of demonstrating that he was\nprejudiced by any deficiency in his attorneys\u2019 performance.\n   These are the reasons for my dissent.\n                              I\n  Under any standard of review the investigation per-\nformed by Rompilla\u2019s counsel in preparation for sentencing\nwas not only adequate but also conscientious.\n  Rompilla\u2019s attorneys recognized from the outset that\nbuilding an effective mitigation case was crucial to helping\ntheir client avoid the death penalty. App. 516, 576. Rom-\npilla stood accused of a brutal crime. In January 1988,\nJames Scanlon was murdered while he was closing the\nCozy Corner Cafe, a bar he owned in Allentown, Pennsyl-\nvania. Scanlon\u2019s body was discovered later the next morn-\ning, lying in a pool of blood. Scanlon had been stabbed\nmultiple times, including 16 wounds around the neck and\nhead. Scanlon also had been beaten with a blunt object,\nand his face had been gashed, possibly with shards from\nbroken liquor and beer bottles found at the scene of the\ncrime. After Scanlon was stabbed to death his body had\nbeen set on fire.\n  Substantial evidence linked Rompilla to the crime. See\ngenerally Commonwealth v. Rompilla, 539 Pa. 499, 505\u2013\n506, 653 A. 2d 626, 629\u2013630 (1995). He was at the Cozy\nCorner Cafe near closing time on the night of the murder\nand was observed going to the bathroom approximately 10\ntimes during a 1-hour period. A window in that bathroom,\nthe police later determined, was the probable point of\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nentry used by Scanlon\u2019s assailant. A pair of Rompilla\u2019s\nsneakers seized by the police matched a bloody footprint\nfound near the victim\u2019s body, and blood on the sneakers\nmatched the victim\u2019s blood type. Rompilla\u2019s fingerprint\nwas found on one of the two knives used to commit the\nmurder. Sometime after leaving the bar on the night of\nthe murder, Rompilla checked into a nearby motel under a\nfalse name. Although he told the police he left the bar\nwith only two dollars, Rompilla had paid cash for the room\nand flashed a large amount of money to the desk clerks.\nThe victim\u2019s wallet was discovered in the bushes just\noutside of Rompilla\u2019s motel room. When the police ques-\ntioned Rompilla about the murder, his version of events\nwas inconsistent with the testimony of other witnesses.\n   Rompilla was represented at trial by Fredrick Charles,\nthe chief public defender for Lehigh County at the time,\nand Maria Dantos, an assistant public defender. Charles\nand Dantos were assisted by John Whispell, an investiga-\ntor in the public defender\u2019s office. Rompilla\u2019s defense team\nsought to develop mitigating evidence from various\nsources.    First, they questioned Rompilla extensively\nabout his upbringing and background. App. 668\u2013669. To\nmake these conversations more productive they provided\nRompilla with a list of the mitigating circumstances rec-\nognized by Pennsylvania law. Id., at 657. Cf. Strickland,\n466 U. S., at 691 (\u201c[W]hen a defendant has given counsel\nreason to believe that pursuing certain investigations would\nbe fruitless or even harmful, counsel\u2019s failure to pursue\nthose investigations may not later be challenged as unrea-\nsonable\u201d). Second, Charles and Dantos arranged for Rom-\npilla to be examined by three experienced mental health\nprofessionals, experts described by Charles as \u201cthe best\nforensic psychiatrist around here, [another] tremendous\npsychiatrist and a fabulous forensic psychologist.\u201d App.\n672. Finally, Rompilla\u2019s attorneys questioned his family\nextensively in search of any information that might help\n4                    ROMPILLA v.

Dantos, in particular, developed a\n\u201cvery close\u201d relationship with Rompilla\u2019s family, which\nwas a \u201cconstant source of information.\u201d Id., at 557, 729.\nIndeed, after trial Rompilla\u2019s wife sent Dantos a letter\nexpressing her gratitude. Id., at 733. The letter referred\nto Charles and Dantos as \u201csuperb human beings\u201d who\n\u201cfought and felt everything [Rompilla\u2019s] family did.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Court acknowledges the steps taken by Rompilla\u2019s\nattorneys in preparation for sentencing but finds fault\nnonetheless. \u201c[T]he lawyers were deficient,\u201d the Court\nsays, \u201cin failing to examine the court file on Rompilla\u2019s\nprior conviction.\u201d Ante, at 7.\n   The prior conviction the Court refers to is Rompilla\u2019s\n1974 conviction for rape, burglary, and theft. See Com-\nmonwealth v. Rompilla, 250 Pa. Super. 139, 378 A. 2d 865\n(1977). Before the sentencing phase of the capital case,\nthe Commonwealth informed Rompilla\u2019s attorneys that it\nintended to use these prior crimes to prove one of the\nstatutory aggravating circumstances\u2014namely, that Rom-\npilla had a \u201csignificant history of felony convictions involv-\ning the use or threat of violence to the person.\u201d 42 Pa.\nCons. Stat. \u00a79711(d)(9) (2002). Rompilla\u2019s attorneys were\non notice of the Commonwealth\u2019s plans, and from this the\nCourt concludes that effective assistance of counsel re-\nquired a review of the prior conviction case file.\n   A per se rule requiring counsel in every case to review\nthe records of prior convictions used by the State as ag-\ngravation evidence is a radical departure from Strickland\nand its progeny. We have warned in the past against the\ncreation of \u201cspecific guidelines\u201d or \u201cchecklist[s] for judicial\nevaluation of attorney performance.\u201d 466 U.

Any such set of\nrules would interfere with the constitutionally protected\nindependence of counsel and restrict the wide latitude\ncounsel must have in making tactical decisions. Indeed,\nthe existence of detailed guidelines for representation\ncould distract from the overriding mission of vigorous\nadvocacy of the defendant\u2019s cause.\u201d Strickland, 466 U. S.,\nat 688\u2013689 (citations omitted). For this reason, while we\nhave referred to the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice\nas a useful point of reference, we have been careful to say\nthese standards \u201care only guides\u201d and do not establish the\nconstitutional baseline for effective assistance of counsel.\nIbid. The majority, by parsing the guidelines as if they\nwere binding statutory text, ignores this admonition.\n   The majority\u2019s analysis contains barely a mention of\nStrickland and makes little effort to square today\u2019s hold-\ning with our traditional reluctance to impose rigid re-\nquirements on defense counsel. While the Court disclaims\nany intention to create a bright-line rule, ante, at 14; see\nalso ante, at 1 (O\u2019CONNOR, J., concurring), this affords\nlittle comfort. The Court\u2019s opinion makes clear it has\nimposed on counsel a broad obligation to review prior\nconviction case files where those priors are used in aggra-\nvation\u2014and to review every document in those files if not\nevery single page of every document, regardless of the\nprosecution\u2019s proposed use for the prior conviction. Infra,\nat 8, 12\u201313. One member of the majority tries to limit the\nCourt\u2019s new rule by arguing that counsel\u2019s decision here\nwas \u201cnot the result of an informed tactical decision,\u201d ante,\nat 3 (O\u2019CONNOR, J., concurring), but the record gives no\nsupport for this notion. The Court also protests that the\nexceptional weight Rompilla\u2019s attorneys at sentencing\nplaced on residual doubt required them to review the prior\nconviction file, ante, at 14; ante, at 2\u20133 (O\u2019CONNOR, J.,\nconcurring). In fact, residual doubt was not central to\n6                   ROMPILLA v. BEARD\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nRompilla\u2019s mitigation case. Rompilla\u2019s family members\ndid testify at sentencing that they thought he was inno-\ncent, but Dantos tried to draw attention away from this\npoint and instead use the family\u2019s testimony to humanize\nRompilla and ask for mercy. App. 123\u2013149.\n   The majority also disregards the sound strategic calcu-\nlation supporting the decisions made by Rompilla\u2019s attor-\nneys. Charles and Dantos were \u201caware of [Rompilla\u2019s]\npriors\u201d and \u201caware of the circumstances\u201d surrounding\nthese convictions. Id., at 507. At the postconviction hear-\ning, Dantos also indicated that she had reviewed docu-\nments relating to the prior conviction. Ibid. Based on this\ninformation, as well as their numerous conversations with\nRompilla and his family, Charles and Dantos reasonably\ncould conclude that reviewing the full prior conviction case\nfile was not the best allocation of resources.\n   The majority concludes otherwise only by ignoring\nStrickland\u2019s command that \u201c[j]udicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s\nperformance must be highly deferential.\u201d 466 U. S., at\n689. According to the Court, the Constitution required\nnothing less than a full review of the prior conviction case\nfile by Rompilla\u2019s attorneys. Even with the benefit of\nhindsight the Court struggles to explain how the file\nwould have proved helpful, offering only the vague specu-\nlation that Rompilla\u2019s attorneys might have discovered\n\u201ccircumstances that extenuated the behavior described by\nthe [rape] victim.\u201d Ante, at 10. What the Court means by\n\u201ccircumstances\u201d is a mystery. If the Court is referring to\ndetails on Rompilla\u2019s mental fitness or upbringing, surely\nRompilla\u2019s attorneys were more likely to discover such\ninformation through the sources they consulted: Rompilla;\nhis family; and the three mental health experts that exam-\nined him.\n   Perhaps the circumstances to which the majority refers\nare the details of Rompilla\u2019s 1974 crimes. Charles and\nDantos, however, had enough information about the prior\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            7\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nconvictions to determine that reviewing the case file was\nnot the most effective use of their time. Rompilla had\nbeen convicted of breaking into the residence of Josephine\nMacrenna, who lived in an apartment above the bar she\nowned. App. 56\u201389. After Macrenna gave him the bar\u2019s\nreceipts for the night, Rompilla demanded that she dis-\nrobe. When she initially resisted, Rompilla slashed her\nleft breast with a knife. Rompilla then held Macrenna at\nknifepoint while he raped her for over an hour. Charles\nand Dantos were aware of these circumstances of the prior\nconviction and the brutality of the crime. Id., at 507. It\ndid not take a review of the case file to know that quib-\nbling with the Commonwealth\u2019s version of events was a\ndubious trial strategy. At sentencing Dantos fought vigor-\nously to prevent the Commonwealth from introducing the\ndetails of the 1974 crimes, id., at 16\u201340, but once the\ntranscript was admitted there was nothing that could be\ndone. Rompilla was unlikely to endear himself to the jury\nby arguing that his prior conviction for burglary, theft,\nand rape really was not as bad as the Commonwealth was\nmaking it out to be. Recognizing this, Rompilla\u2019s attor-\nneys instead devoted their limited time and resources to\ndeveloping a mitigation case. That those efforts turned\nup little useful evidence does not make the ex ante strate-\ngic calculation of Rompilla\u2019s attorneys constitutionally\ndeficient.\n   One of the primary reasons this Court has rejected a\nchecklist approach to effective assistance of counsel is that\neach new requirement risks distracting attorneys from the\nreal objective of providing vigorous advocacy as dictated by\nthe facts and circumstances in the particular case. The\nCourt\u2019s rigid requirement that counsel always review the\ncase files of convictions the prosecution seeks to use at\ntrial will be just such a distraction. Capital defendants\noften have a history of crime. For example, as of 2003, 64\npercent of inmates on death row had prior felony convic-\n8                    ROMPILLA v. BEARD\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ntions. U. S. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics,\nT. Bonczar & T. Snell, Capital Punishment, 2003, p. 8\n(Nov. 2004), available at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/\npdf/cp03.pdf (as visited June 16, 2005, and available in\nClerk of Court\u2019s case file). If the prosecution relies on\nthese convictions as aggravators, the Court has now obli-\ngated defense attorneys to review the boxes of documents\nthat come with them.\n   In imposing this new rule, the Court states that counsel\nin this case could review the \u201centire file\u201d with \u201cease.\u201d\nAnte, 10, n. 4. There is simply no support in the record for\nthis assumption. Case files often comprise numerous\nboxes. The file may contain, among other things, witness\nstatements, forensic evidence, arrest reports, grand jury\ntranscripts, testimony and exhibits relating to any pretrial\nsuppression hearings, trial transcripts, trial exhibits, post-\ntrial motions and presentence reports. Full review of even\na single prior conviction case file could be time consuming,\nand many of the documents in a file are duplicative or\nirrelevant. The Court, recognizing the flaw in its analysis,\nsuggests that cases involving \u201cwarehouses of records\u201d \u201cwill\ncall for greater subtlety.\u201d Ibid. Yet for all we know, this is\nsuch a case. As to the time component, the Court tells us\nnothing as to the number of hours counsel had available to\nprepare for sentencing or why the decisions they made in\nallocating their time were so flawed as to constitute defi-\ncient performance under Strickland.\n   Today\u2019s decision will not increase the resources commit-\nted to capital defense. (At the time of Rompilla\u2019s trial, the\nLehigh County Public Defender\u2019s Office had two investiga-\ntors for 2,000 cases. App. 662.) If defense attorneys duti-\nfully comply with the Court\u2019s new rule, they will have to\ndivert resources from other tasks. The net effect of today\u2019s\nholding in many cases\u2014instances where trial counsel\nreasonably can conclude that reviewing old case files is not\nan effective use of time\u2014will be to diminish the quality of\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            9\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nrepresentation. We have \u201cconsistently declined to impose\nmechanical rules on counsel\u2014even when those rules might\nlead to better representation,\u201d Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528\nU. S., at 481; I see no occasion to depart from this approach\nin order to impose a requirement that might well lead to\nworse representation.\n   It is quite possible defense attorneys, recognizing the\nabsurdity of a one-size-fits-all approach to effective advo-\ncacy, will simply ignore the Court\u2019s new requirement and\ncontinue to exercise their best judgment about how to\nallocate time and resources in preparation for trial. While\nthis decision would be understandable\u2014and might even be\nrequired by state ethical rules, cf. Pa. Rules of Profes-\nsional Conduct, Preamble, and Rule 1.1 (2005)\u2014it leaves\nopen the possibility that a defendant will seek to over-\nturn his conviction based on something in a prior convic-\ntion case file that went unreviewed. This elevation of\nneedle-in-a-haystack claims to the status of constitu-\ntional violations will benefit undeserving defendants and\nsaddle States with the considerable costs of retrial and/or\nresentencing.\n   Today\u2019s decision is wrong under any standard, but the\nCourt\u2019s error is compounded by the fact that this case\narises on federal habeas. The Pennsylvania Supreme\nCourt adjudicated Rompilla\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-\ncounsel claim on the merits, and this means 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)\u2019s deferential standard of review applies. Rom-\npilla must show that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\ndecision was not just \u201cincorrect or erroneous,\u201d but \u201cobjec-\ntively unreasonable.\u201d Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 75\n(2003) (citing Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 410, 412\n(2000)). He cannot do so.\n   The Court pays lipservice to the Williams standard, but\nit proceeds to adopt a rigid, per se obligation that binds\ncounsel in every case and finds little support in our prece-\ndents. Indeed, Strickland, the case the Court purports to\n10                  ROMPILLA v. BEARD\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\napply, is directly to the contrary: \u201cMost important, in\nadjudicating a claim of actual ineffectiveness of counsel, a\ncourt should keep in mind that the principles we have\nstated do not establish mechanical rules.\u201d 466 U. S., at\n696. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court gave careful con-\nsideration to Rompilla\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim and\nconcluded that \u201ccounsel reasonably relied upon their\ndiscussions with [Rompilla] and upon their experts to\ndetermine the records needed to evaluate his mental\nhealth and other potential mitigating circumstances.\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Rompilla, 554 Pa. 378, 385\u2013386, 721\nA. 2d 786, 790 (1998). This decision was far from unrea-\nsonable. The Pennsylvania courts can hardly be faulted\nfor failing to anticipate today\u2019s abrupt departure from\nStrickland.\n  We have reminded federal courts often of the need to\nshow the requisite level of deference to state-court judg-\nments under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d). Holland v. Jackson, 542\nU. S. ___ (2004) (per curiam); Middleton v. McNeil, 541\nU. S. 433 (2004) (per curiam); Yarborough v. Gentry, 540\nU. S. 1 (2003) (per curiam); Mitchell v. Esparza, 540 U. S.\n12 (2003) (per curiam); Early v. Packer, 537 U. S. 3 (2002)\n(per curiam); Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19 (2002) (per\ncuriam). By ignoring our own admonition today, the Court\nadopts a do-as-we-say, not-as-we-do approach to federal\nhabeas review.\n                              II\n  Even accepting the Court\u2019s misguided analysis of the\nadequacy of representation by Rompilla\u2019s trial counsel,\nRompilla is still not entitled to habeas relief. Strickland\nassigns the defendant the burden of demonstrating preju-\ndice, 466 U. S., at 692. Rompilla cannot satisfy this stan-\ndard, and only through a remarkable leap can the Court\nconclude otherwise.\n  The Court\u2019s theory of prejudice rests on serendipity.\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           11\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nNothing in the old case file diminishes the aggravating\nnature of the prior conviction. The only way Rompilla\u2019s\nattorneys could have minimized the aggravating force of\nthe earlier rape conviction was through Dantos\u2019 forceful,\nbut ultimately unsuccessful, fight to exclude the transcript\nat sentencing. The Court, recognizing this problem, in-\nstead finds prejudice through chance. If Rompilla\u2019s attor-\nneys had reviewed the case file of his prior rape and bur-\nglary conviction, the Court says, they would have\nstumbled across \u201ca range of mitigation leads.\u201d Ante, at 15.\n   The range of leads to which the Court refers is in fact a\nhandful of notations within a single 10-page document.\nThe document, an \u201cInitial Transfer Petition,\u201d appears to\nhave been prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of\nCorrections after Rompilla\u2019s conviction to facilitate his\ninitial assignment to one of the Commonwealth\u2019s maxi-\nmum-security prisons. Lodging 31\u201340.\n   Rompilla cannot demonstrate prejudice because nothing\nin the record indicates that Rompilla\u2019s trial attorneys\nwould have discovered the transfer petition, or the clues\ncontained in it, if they had reviewed the old file. The\nmajority faults Rompilla\u2019s attorneys for failing to \u201clearn\nwhat the Commonwealth knew about the crime,\u201d \u201cdiscover\nany mitigating evidence the Commonwealth would down-\nplay,\u201d and \u201canticipate the details of the aggravating evi-\ndence the Commonwealth would emphasize.\u201d Ante, at 10.\nYet if Rompilla\u2019s attorneys had reviewed the case file with\nthese purposes in mind, they almost surely would have\nattributed no significance to the transfer petition following\nonly a cursory review. The petition, after all, was pre-\npared by the Bureau of Correction after Rompilla\u2019s convic-\ntion for the purpose of determining Rompilla\u2019s initial\nprison assignment. It contained no details regarding the\ncircumstances of the conviction. Reviewing the prior\nconviction file for information to counter the Common-\nwealth, counsel would have looked first at the transcript of\n12                  ROMPILLA v. BEARD\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nthe trial testimony, and perhaps then to probative exhibits\nor forensic evidence. There would have been no reason for\ncounsel to read, or even to skim, this obscure document.\n  The Court claims that the transfer petition would have\nbeen discovered because it was in the \u201csame file\u201d with the\ntranscript, ante, at 15, but this characterization is mis-\nleading and the conclusion the Court draws from it is\naccordingly fallacious. The record indicates only that the\ntransfer petition was a part of the same case file, but\nRompilla provides no indication of the size of the file,\nwhich for all we know originally comprised several boxes\nof documents. App. 508, 571, 631. By the time of Rom-\npilla\u2019s state postconviction hearing, moreover, the transfer\npetition was not stored in any \u201cfile\u201d at all\u2014it had been\ntransferred to microfilm. Id., at 461. The Court implies in\na footnote that prejudice can be presumed because \u201cPenn-\nsylvania conspicuously failed to contest Rompilla\u2019s\u201d inevi-\ntable-discovery argument. Ante, at 15, n. 8. The Com-\nmonwealth\u2019s strategy is unsurprising given that\ndiscussion of the prior conviction case file takes up only\none paragraph of Rompilla\u2019s argument, Brief for Petitioner\n35\u201336, but it is also irrelevant. It is well established that\nRompilla, not the Commonwealth, has the burden of es-\ntablishing prejudice. Strickland, supra, at 694.\n  The majority thus finds itself in a bind. If counsel\u2019s\nalleged deficiency lies in the failure to review the file for\nthe purposes the majority has identified, then there is no\nprejudice: for there is no reasonable probability that re-\nview of the file for those purposes would have led counsel\nto accord the transfer petition enough attention to discover\nthe leads the majority cites. Prejudice could only be dem-\nonstrated if the deficiency in counsel\u2019s performance were\nto be described not as the failure to perform a purposive\nreview of the file, but instead as the failure to accord\nintense scrutiny to every single page of every single docu-\nment in that file, regardless of the purpose motivating the\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           13\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nreview. At times, the Court hints that its new obligation\non counsel sweeps this broadly. See ante, at 10, n. 4 (\u201cThe\nease with which counsel could examine the entire file\n. . .\u201d); ante, at 10\u201311, n. 5 (\u201c[C]ounsel had no way of know-\ning the context of the transcript and the details of the\nprior conviction without looking at the file as a whole\u201d).\nSurely, however, the Court would not require defense\ncounsel to look at every document, no matter how tangen-\ntial, included in the prior conviction file on the off chance\nthat some notation therein might provide a lead, which in\nturn might result in the discovery of useful information.\nThe Constitution does not mandate that defense attorneys\nperform busy work. This rigid requirement would divert\ncounsel\u2019s limited time and energy away from more impor-\ntant tasks. In this way, it would ultimately disserve the\nrationale underlying the Court\u2019s new rule, which is to\nensure that defense counsel counter the State\u2019s aggrava-\ntion case effectively.\n    If the Court does intend to impose on counsel a constitu-\ntional obligation to review every page of every document\nincluded in the case file of a prior conviction, then today\u2019s\nholding is even more misguided than I imagined.\n                        *    *     *\n  Strickland anticipated the temptation \u201cto second-guess\ncounsel\u2019s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence\u201d\nand cautioned that \u201c[a] fair assessment of attorney per-\nformance requires that every effort be made to eliminate\nthe distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the cir-\ncumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evalu-\nate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d\n466 U. S., at 689. Today, the Court succumbs to the very\ntemptation that Strickland warned against. In the proc-\ness, the majority imposes on defense attorneys a rigid\nrequirement that finds no support in our cases or common\nsense.\n  I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n",

We hold that even when a capital defendant's family members and the defendant himself have suggested that no mitigating evidence is available, his lawyer is bound to make reasonable efforts to obtain and review material that counsel knows the prosecution will probably rely on as evidence of aggravation at the sentencing phase of trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>On the morning of January 14, 1988, James Scanlon was discovered dead in a bar he ran in Allentown, Pennsylvania, his body having been stabbed repeatedly and set on fire. Ronald Rompilla was indicted for the murder and related offenses, and the Commonwealth gave notice of intent to ask <span class=\"star-pagination\">*378</span> for the death penalty. Two public defenders were assigned to the case.</p>\n<p>The jury at the guilt phase of trial found Rompilla guilty on all counts, and during the ensuing penalty phase, the prosecutor sought to prove three aggravating factors to justify a death sentence: that the murder was committed in the course of another felony; that the murder was committed by torture; and that Rompilla had a significant history of felony convictions indicating the use or threat of violence. See 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 9711(d)(6), (8), (9) (2002). The Commonwealth presented evidence on all three aggravators, and the jury found all proven. Rompilla's evidence in mitigation consisted of relatively brief testimony: five of his family members argued in effect for residual doubt, and beseeched the jury for mercy, saying that they believed Rompilla was innocent and a good man. Rompilla's 14-year-old son testified that he loved his father and would visit him in prison. The jury acknowledged this evidence to the point of finding, as two factors in mitigation, that Rompilla's son had testified on his behalf and that rehabilitation was possible. But the jurors assigned the greater weight to the aggravating factors, and sentenced Rompilla to death. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed both conviction and sentence. <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Rompilla,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2011060\"><a href=\"/opinion/2011060/com-v-rompilla/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2011060\"><a href=\"/opinion/2011060/com-v-rompilla/\"><span class=\"volume\">653</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span> (1995).</p>\n<p>In December 1995, with new lawyers, Rompilla filed claims under the Pennsylvania Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 9541 <i>et seq.</i> (2004), including ineffective assistance by trial counsel in failing to present significant mitigating evidence about Rompilla's childhood, mental capacity and health, and alcoholism. The postconviction court found that trial counsel had done enough to investigate the possibilities of a mitigation case, and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the denial of relief. <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Rompilla,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1508255\"><a href=\"/opinion/1508255/com-v-rompilla/\"><span class=\"volume\">721</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">786</span></a></span> (1998).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*379</span> Rompilla then petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254 in Federal District Court, raising claims that included inadequate representation. The District Court found that the State Supreme Court had unreasonably applied <i>Strickland</i> v. <i>Washington,</i> 466 U. S. 668 (1984), as to the penalty phase of the trial, and granted relief for ineffective assistance of counsel. The court found that in preparing the mitigation case the defense lawyers had failed to investigate \"pretty obvious signs\" that Rompilla had a troubled childhood and suffered from mental illness and alcoholism, and instead had relied unjustifiably on Rompilla's own description of an unexceptional background. <i>Rompilla</i> v. <i>Horn,</i> No. CIV.A.99-737 (ED Pa., July 11, 2000), App. 1307-1308.</p>\n<p>A divided Third Circuit panel reversed. <i>Rompilla</i> v. <i>Horn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784773\"><a href=\"/opinion/784773/ronald-rompilla-v-martin-horn-commissioner-pennsyl/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span> (2004). The majority found nothing unreasonable in the state court's application of <i>Strickland,</i> given defense counsel's efforts to uncover mitigation material, which included interviewing Rompilla and certain family members, as well as consultation with three mental health experts. Although the majority noted that the lawyers did not unearth the \"useful information\" to be found in Rompilla's \"school, medical, police, and prison records,\" it thought the lawyers were justified in failing to hunt through these records when their other efforts gave no reason to believe the search would yield anything helpful. 355 F.3d, at 252. The panel thus distinguished Rompilla's case from <i>Wiggins</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> 539 U. S. 510 (2003). Whereas Wiggins's counsel failed to investigate adequately, to the point even of ignoring the leads their limited enquiry yielded, the Court of Appeals saw the Rompilla investigation as going far enough to leave counsel with reason for thinking further efforts would not be a wise use of the limited resources they had. But Judge Sloviter's dissent stressed that trial counsel's failure to obtain relevant records on Rompilla's background was owing to the lawyers' unreasonable reliance on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*380</span> family members and medical experts to tell them what records might be useful.

S., at 687, with performance being measured against an \"objective standard of reasonableness,\" <i>id.,</i> at 688, \"under prevailing professional norms,\" <i>ibid.; </i><i>Wiggins</i> v. <i>Smith, supra,</i> at 521. This case, like some others recently, looks to norms of adequate investigation in preparing for the sentencing phase of a capital trial, when defense counsel's job is to counter the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*381</span> State's evidence of aggravated culpability with evidence in mitigation. In judging the defense's investigation, as in applying <i>Strickland</i> generally, hindsight is discounted by pegging adequacy to \"counsel's perspective at the time\" investigative decisions are made, 466 U. S., at 689, and by giving a \"heavy measure of deference to counsel's judgments,\" <i>id.,</i> at 691.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>A standard of reasonableness applied as if one stood in counsel's shoes spawns few hard-edged rules, and the merits of a number of counsel's choices in this case are subject to fair debate. This is not a case in which defense counsel simply ignored their obligation to find mitigating evidence, and their workload as busy public defenders did not keep them from making a number of efforts, including interviews with Rompilla and some members of his family, and examinations of reports by three mental health experts who gave opinions at the guilt phase. None of the sources proved particularly helpful.</p>\n<p>Rompilla's own contributions to any mitigation case were minimal. Counsel found him uninterested in helping, as on their visit to his prison to go over a proposed mitigation strategy, when Rompilla told them he was \"bored being here listening\" and returned to his cell. App. 668. To questions about childhood and schooling, his answers indicated they had been normal, <i>ibid.,</i> save for quitting school in the ninth grade, <i>id.,</i> at 677. There were times when Rompilla was even actively obstructive by sending counsel off on false leads. <i>Id.,</i> at 663-664.</p>\n<p>The lawyers also spoke with five members of Rompilla's family (his former wife, two brothers, a sister-in-law, and his son), <i>id.,</i> at 494, and counsel testified that they developed a good relationship with the family in the course of their representation, <i>id.,</i> at 669, 729. The state postconviction court found that counsel spoke to the relatives in a \"detailed manner,\" attempting to unearth mitigating information, <i>id.,</i> at 264, although the weight of this finding is qualified by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*382</span> lawyers' concession that \"the overwhelming response from the family was that they didn't really feel as though they knew him all that well since he had spent the majority of his adult years and some of his childhood years in custody,\" <i>id.,</i> at 495; see also <i>id.,</i> at 669. Defense counsel also said that because the family was \"coming from the position that [Rompilla] was innocent . . . they weren't looking for reasons for why he might have done this.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 494.</p>\n<p>The third and final source tapped for mitigating material was the cadre of three mental health witnesses who were asked to look into Rompilla's mental state as of the time of the offense and his competency to stand trial. <i>Id.,</i> at 473-474, 476. But their reports revealed \"nothing useful\" to Rompilla's case, <i>id.,</i> at 1358, and the lawyers consequently did not go to any other historical source that might have cast light on Rompilla's mental condition.</p>\n<p>When new counsel entered the case to raise Rompilla's postconviction claims, however, they identified a number of likely avenues the trial lawyers could fruitfully have followed in building a mitigation case. School records are one example, which trial counsel never examined in spite of the professed unfamiliarity of the several family members with Rompilla's childhood, and despite counsel's knowledge that Rompilla left school after the ninth grade. <i>Id.,</i> at 677. Other examples are records of Rompilla's juvenile and adult incarcerations, which counsel did not consult, although they were aware of their client's criminal record. And while counsel knew from police reports provided in pretrial discovery that Rompilla had been drinking heavily at the time of his offense, Lodging to App. 111-120 (hereinafter Lodging), and although one of the mental health experts reported that Rompilla's troubles with alcohol merited further investigation, App. 723-724, counsel did not look for evidence of a history of dependence on alcohol that might have extenuating significance.</p>\n<p>Before us, trial counsel and the Commonwealth respond to these unexplored possibilities by emphasizing this Court's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*383</span> recognition that the duty to investigate does not force defense lawyers to scour the globe on the off chance something will turn up; reasonably diligent counsel may draw a line when they have good reason to think further investigation would be a waste. See <i>Wiggins</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> 539 U. S., at 525 (further investigation excusable where counsel has evidence suggesting it would be fruitless); <i>Strickland</i> v. <i>Washington, supra,</i> at 699 (counsel could \"reasonably surmise . . . that character and psychological evidence would be of little help\"); <i>Burger</i> v. <i>Kemp,</i> 483 U. S. 776, 794 (1987) (limited investigation reasonable because all witnesses brought to counsel's attention provided predominantly harmful information). The Commonwealth argues that the information trial counsel gathered from Rompilla and the other sources gave them sound reason to think it would have been pointless to spend time and money on the additional investigation espoused by postconviction counsel, and we can say that there is room for debate about trial counsel's obligation to follow at least some of those potential lines of enquiry. There is no need to say more, however, for a further point is clear and dispositive: the lawyers were deficient in failing to examine the court file on Rompilla's prior conviction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>There is an obvious reason that the failure to examine Rompilla's prior conviction file fell below the level of reasonable performance. Counsel knew that the Commonwealth intended to seek the death penalty by proving Rompilla had a significant history of felony convictions indicating the use or threat of violence, an aggravator under state law. Counsel further knew that the Commonwealth would attempt to establish this history by proving Rompilla's prior conviction for rape and assault, and would emphasize his violent character by introducing a transcript of the rape victim's testimony given in that earlier trial. App. 665-666. There is no question that defense counsel were on notice, since they acknowledge that a \"plea letter,\" written by one of them four days <span class=\"star-pagination\">*384</span> prior to trial, mentioned the prosecutor's plans. <i>Ibid.</i> It is also undisputed that the prior conviction file was a public document, readily available for the asking at the very courthouse where Rompilla was to be tried.</p>\n<p>It is clear, however, that defense counsel did not look at any part of that file, including the transcript, until warned by the prosecution a second time. In a colloquy the day before the evidentiary sentencing phase began, the prosecutor again said he would present the transcript of the victim's testimony to establish the prior conviction.</p>\n<blockquote>\"[DEFENSE]: I would also like to review whatever he's going to read from.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"[PROSECUTOR]: Well, I told you that I was going to do this a long time ago. You certainly had the opportunity to review the Transcript.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>.      .      .      .      .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"[DEFENSE]: Well, I would like a copy of this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"[PROSECUTOR]: I don't think that's my duty to provide you with a copy. That's a public record, and you could have gotten that Transcript at any time prior to this Trial. I made one copy for myself, and I'd like to have it now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"[DEFENSE]: Well, Judge, then I'm going to need to get a copy of it. I'm going to need to get a copy of it.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 32, 36.<sup>[2]</sup></blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*385</span> At the postconviction evidentiary hearing, Rompilla's lawyer confirmed that she had not seen the transcript before the hearing in which this exchange took place, <i>id.,</i> at 506-507, and crucially, even after obtaining the transcript of the victim's testimony on the eve of the sentencing hearing, counsel apparently examined none of the other material in the file.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>With every effort to view the facts as a defense lawyer would have done at the time, it is difficult to see how counsel could have failed to realize that without examining the readily available file they were seriously compromising their opportunity to respond to a case for aggravation. The prosecution was going to use the dramatic facts of a similar prior offense, and Rompilla's counsel had a duty to make all reasonable efforts to learn what they could about the offense. Reasonable efforts certainly included obtaining the Commonwealth's own readily available file on the prior conviction to learn what the Commonwealth knew about the crime, to discover any mitigating evidence the Commonwealth would downplay, and to anticipate the details of the aggravating <span class=\"star-pagination\">*386</span> evidence the Commonwealth would emphasize.<sup>[4]</sup> Without making reasonable efforts to review the file, defense counsel could have had no hope of knowing whether the prosecution was quoting selectively from the transcript, or whether there were circumstances extenuating the behavior described by the victim. The obligation to get the file was particularly pressing here owing to the similarity of the violent prior offense to the crime charged and Rompilla's sentencing strategy stressing residual doubt. Without making efforts to learn the details and rebut the relevance of the earlier crime, a convincing argument for residual doubt was certainly beyond any hope.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*387</span> The notion that defense counsel must obtain information that the State has and will use against the defendant is not simply a matter of common sense. As the District Court points out, the American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice in circulation at the time of Rompilla's trial describes the obligation in terms no one could misunderstand in the circumstances of a case like this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\"It is the duty of the lawyer to conduct a prompt investigation of the circumstances of the case and to explore all avenues leading to facts relevant to the merits of the case and the penalty in the event of conviction. The investigation should always include efforts to secure information in the possession of the prosecution and law enforcement authorities. The duty to investigate exists regardless of the accused's admissions or statements to the lawyer of facts constituting guilt or the accused's stated desire to plead guilty.\" 1 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 4-4.1 (2d ed. 1982 Supp.).<sup>[6]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>\"[W]e long have referred [to these ABA Standards] as `guides to determining what is reasonable.'\" <i>Wiggins</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> 539 U. S., at 524 (quoting <i>Strickland</i> v. <i>Washington,</i> 466 U. S., at 688), and the Commonwealth has come up with no reason to think the quoted standard impertinent here.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*388</span> At argument the most that Pennsylvania (and the United States as <i>amicus</i>) could say was that defense counsel's efforts to find mitigating evidence by other means excused them from looking at the prior conviction file. Tr. of Oral Arg. 37-39, 45-46. And that, of course, is the position taken by the state postconviction courts. Without specifically discussing the prior case file, they too found that defense counsel's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*389</span> efforts were enough to free them from any obligation to enquire further. <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Rompilla,</i> No. 682/1988 (Pa. Ct. Common Pleas, Aug. 23, 1996), App. 263-264, 272-273.</p>\n<p>We think this conclusion of the state court fails to answer the considerations we have set out, to the point of being an objectively unreasonable conclusion. It flouts prudence to deny that a defense lawyer should try to look at a file he knows the prosecution will cull for aggravating evidence, let alone when the file is sitting in the trial courthouse, open for the asking. No reasonable lawyer would forgo examination of the file thinking he could do as well by asking the defendant or family relations whether they recalled anything helpful or damaging in the prior victim's testimony. Nor would a reasonable lawyer compare possible searches for school reports, juvenile records, and evidence of drinking habits to the opportunity to take a look at a file disclosing what the prosecutor knows and even plans to read from in his case. Questioning a few more family members and searching for old records can promise less than looking for a needle in a haystack, when a lawyer truly has reason to doubt there is any needle there. <i>E. g., </i><i>Strickland, supra,</i> at 699. But looking at a file the prosecution says it will use is a sure bet: whatever may be in that file is going to tell defense counsel something about what the prosecution can produce.</p>\n<p>The dissent thinks this analysis creates a \"rigid, <i>per se</i>\" rule that requires defense counsel to do a complete review of the file on any prior conviction introduced, <i>post,</i> at 9 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.), but that is a mistake. Counsel fell short here because they failed to make reasonable efforts to review the prior conviction file, despite knowing that the prosecution intended to introduce Rompilla's prior conviction not merely by entering a notice of conviction into evidence but by quoting damaging testimony of the rape victim in that case. The unreasonableness of attempting no more than they did was heightened by the easy availability of the file <span class=\"star-pagination\">*390</span> at the trial courthouse, and the great risk that testimony about a similar violent crime would hamstring counsel's chosen defense of residual doubt. It is owing to these circumstances that the state courts were objectively unreasonable in concluding that counsel could reasonably decline to make any effort to review the file. Other situations, where a defense lawyer is not charged with knowledge that the prosecutor intends to use a prior conviction in this way, might well warrant a different assessment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Since counsel's failure to look at the file fell below the line of reasonable practice, there is a further question about prejudice, that is, whether \"there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" 466 U. S., at 694. Because the state courts found the representation adequate, they never reached the issue of prejudice, App. 265, 272-273, and so we examine this element of the <i>Strickland</i> claim <i>de novo, </i><i>Wiggins</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> 539 U. S., at 534, and agree with the dissent in the Court of Appeals. We think Rompilla has shown beyond any doubt that counsel's lapse was prejudicial; Pennsylvania, indeed, does not even contest the claim of prejudice.</p>\n<p>If the defense lawyers had looked in the file on Rompilla's prior conviction, it is uncontested they would have found a range of mitigation leads that no other source had opened up. In the same file with the transcript of the prior trial were the records of Rompilla's imprisonment on the earlier conviction, App. 508, 571, 631, which defense counsel testified she had never seen, <i>id.,</i> at 508. The prison files pictured Rompilla's childhood and mental health very differently from anything defense counsel had seen or heard. An evaluation by a corrections counselor states that Rompilla was \"reared in the slum environment of Allentown, Pa. vicinity. He early came to [the] attention of juvenile authorities, quit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*391</span> school at 16, [and] started a series of incarcerations in and out Penna. often of assaultive nature and commonly related to over-indulgence in alcoholic beverages.\" Lodging 40. The same file discloses test results that the defense's mental health experts would have viewed as pointing to schizophrenia and other disorders, and test scores showing a third grade level of cognition after nine years of schooling. <i>Id.,</i> at 32-35.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>The accumulated entries would have destroyed the benign conception of Rompilla's upbringing and mental capacity defense counsel had formed from talking with Rompilla himself and some of his family members, and from the reports of the mental health experts. With this information, counsel would have become skeptical of the impression given by the five family members and would unquestionably have gone further to build a mitigation case. Further effort would presumably have unearthed much of the material post-conviction counsel found, including testimony from several members of Rompilla's family, whom trial counsel did not interview. Judge Sloviter summarized this evidence:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Rompilla's parents were both severe alcoholics who drank constantly. His mother drank during her pregnancy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*392</span> with Rompilla, and he and his brothers eventually developed serious drinking problems. His father, who had a vicious temper, frequently beat Rompilla's mother, leaving her bruised and black-eyed, and bragged about his cheating on her. His parents fought violently, and on at least one occasion his mother stabbed his father. He was abused by his father who beat him when he was young with his hands, fists, leather straps, belts and sticks. All of the children lived in terror. There were no expressions of parental love, affection or approval. Instead, he was subjected to yelling and verbal abuse. His father locked Rompilla and his brother Richard in a small wire mesh dog pen that was filthy and excrement filled. He had an isolated background, and was not allowed to visit other children or to speak to anyone on the phone. They had no indoor plumbing in the house, he slept in the attic with no heat, and the children were not given clothes and attended school in rags.\" 355 F. 3d, at 279 (dissenting opinion) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>The jury never heard any of this and neither did the mental health experts who examined Rompilla before trial. While they found \"nothing helpful to [Rompilla's] case,\" <i>Rompilla,</i> 554 Pa., at 385, 721 A. 2d, at 790, their post-conviction counterparts, alerted by information from school, medical, and prison records that trial counsel never saw, found plenty of \"`red flags'\" pointing up a need to test further. 355 F. 3d, at 279 (Sloviter, J., dissenting). When they tested, they found that Rompilla \"suffers from organic brain damage, an extreme mental disturbance significantly impairing several of his cognitive functions.\" <i>Ibid.</i> They also said that \"Rompilla's problems relate back to his childhood, and were likely caused by fetal alcohol syndrome [and that] Rompilla's capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the law was substantially impaired at the time of the offense.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 280 (Sloviter, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*393</span> These findings in turn would probably have prompted a look at school and juvenile records, all of them easy to get, showing, for example, that when Rompilla was 16 his mother \"was missing from home frequently for a period of one or several weeks at a time.\" Lodging 44. The same report noted that his mother \"has been reported . . . frequently under the influence of alcoholic beverages, with the result that the children have always been poorly kept and on the filthy side which was also the condition of the home at all times.\" <i>Ibid.</i> School records showed Rompilla's IQ was in the mentally retarded range. <i>Id.,</i> at 11, 13, 15.</p>\n<p>This evidence adds up to a mitigation case that bears no relation to the few naked pleas for mercy actually put before the jury, and although we suppose it is possible that a jury could have heard it all and still have decided on the death penalty, that is not the test. It goes without saying that the undiscovered \"mitigating evidence, taken as a whole, `might well have influenced the jury's appraisal' of [Rompilla's] culpability,\" <i>Wiggins</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> 539 U. S., at 538 (quoting <i>Williams</i> v. <i>Taylor,</i> 529 U. S., at 398), and the likelihood of a different result if the evidence had gone in is \"sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\" actually reached at sentencing, <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U. S., at 694.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Third Circuit is reversed, and Pennsylvania must either retry the case on penalty or stipulate to a life sentence.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concurring.</p>\n<p>I write separately to put to rest one concern. The dissent worries that the Court's opinion \"imposes on defense counsel a rigid requirement to review all documents in what it calls the `case file' of any prior conviction that the prosecution might rely on at trial.\" <i>Post,</i> at 396 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). But the Court's opinion imposes no such rule. See <i>ante,</i> at 389-390. Rather, today's decision simply applies <span class=\"star-pagination\">*394</span> our longstanding case-by-case approach to determining whether an attorney's performance was unconstitutionally deficient under <i>Strickland</i> v. <i>Washington,</i> 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Trial counsel's performance in Rompilla's case falls short under that standard, because the attorneys' behavior was not \"reasonable considering all the circumstances.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 688. In particular, there were three circumstances which made the attorneys' failure to examine Rompilla's prior conviction file unreasonable.</p>\n<p>First, Rompilla's attorneys knew that their client's prior conviction would be at the very heart of the <i>prosecution's</i> case. The prior conviction went not to a collateral matter, but rather to one of the aggravating circumstances making Rompilla eligible for the death penalty. The prosecutors intended not merely to mention the fact of prior conviction, but to read testimony about the details of the crime. That crime, besides being quite violent in its own right, was very similar to the murder for which Rompilla was on trial, and Rompilla had committed the murder at issue a mere three months after his release from prison on the earlier conviction. In other words, the prosecutor clearly planned to use details of the prior crime as powerful evidence that Rompilla was a dangerous man for whom the death penalty would be both appropriate punishment and a necessary means of incapacitation. Cf. App. 165-166 (prosecutor's penalty-phase argument). This was evidence the defense should have been prepared to meet: A reasonable defense lawyer would have attached a high importance to obtaining the record of the prior trial, in order to anticipate and find ways of deflecting the prosecutor's aggravation argument.</p>\n<p>Second, the prosecutor's planned use of the prior conviction threatened to eviscerate one of the <i>defense's</i> primary mitigation arguments. Rompilla was convicted on the basis of strong circumstantial evidence. His lawyers structured the entire mitigation argument around the hope of convincing the jury that residual doubt about Rompilla's guilt made <span class=\"star-pagination\">*395</span> it inappropriate to impose the death penalty. In announcing an intention to introduce testimony about Rompilla's similar prior offense, the prosecutor put Rompilla's attorneys on notice that the prospective defense on mitigation likely would be ineffective and counterproductive. The similarities between the two crimes, combined with the timing and the already strong circumstantial evidence, raised a strong likelihood that the jury would reject Rompilla's residual doubt argument. Rompilla's attorneys' reliance on this transparently weak argument risked damaging their credibility. Such a scenario called for further investigation, to determine whether circumstances of the prior case gave any hope of saving the residual doubt argument, or whether the best strategy instead would be to jettison that argument so as to focus on other, more promising issues. Cf. <i>Yarborough</i> v. <i>Gentry,</i> 540 U. S. 1, 7 (2003) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>Bell</i> v. <i>Cone,</i> 535 U. S. 685, 700 (2002) (noting that sound tactical judgment may sometimes call for omitting certain defense evidence or arguments).</p>\n<p>Third, the attorneys' decision not to obtain Rompilla's prior conviction file was not the result of an informed tactical decision about how the lawyers' time would best be spent. Although Rompilla's attorneys had ample warning that the details of Rompilla's prior conviction would be critical to their case, their failure to obtain that file would not necessarily have been deficient if it had resulted from the lawyers' careful exercise of judgment about how best to marshal their time and serve their client. But Rompilla's attorneys did not ignore the prior case file in order to spend their time on other crucial leads. They did not determine that the file was so inaccessible or so large that examining it would necessarily divert them from other trial-preparation tasks they thought more promising. They did not learn at the 11th hour about the prosecution's intent to use the prior conviction, when it was too late for them to change plans. Rather, their failure to obtain the crucial file \"was the result of inattention, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*396</span> not reasoned strategic judgment.\" <i>Wiggins</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> 539 U. S. 510, 534 (2003). As a result, their conduct fell below constitutionally required standards. See <i>id.,</i> at 533 (\"`[S]trategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable' only to the extent that `reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation'\" (quoting <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U. S., at 690-691)).</p>\n<p>In the particular circumstances of this case, the attorneys' failure to obtain and review the case file from their client's prior conviction did not meet standards of \"reasonable professional judgmen[t].\" <i>Id.,</i> at 691. Because the Court's opinion is consistent with the \"`case-by-case examination of the evidence'\" called for under our cases, <i>Williams</i> v. <i>Taylor,</i> 529 U. S. 362, 391 (2000), I join the opinion.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA, and JUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Today the Court brands two committed criminal defense attorneys as ineffective \u0097 \"outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance,\" <i>Strickland</i> v. <i>Washington,</i> 466 U. S. 668, 690 (1984) \u0097 because they did not look in an old case file and stumble upon something they had not set out to find. By implication the Court also labels incompetent the work done by the three mental health professionals who examined Ronald Rompilla. To reach this result, the majority imposes on defense counsel a rigid requirement to review all documents in what it calls the \"case file\" of any prior conviction that the prosecution might rely on at trial. The Court's holding, a mistake under any standard of review, is all the more troubling because this case arises under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. In order to grant Rompilla habeas relief the Court must say, and indeed does say, that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was objectively unreasonable in failing to anticipate today's new case file rule.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*397</span> In my respectful submission it is this Court, not the state court, which is unreasonable. The majority's holding has no place in our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence and, if followed, often will result in less effective counsel by diverting limited defense resources from other important tasks in order to satisfy the Court's new <i>per se</i> rule. Finally, even if the Court could justify its distortion of <i>Strickland,</i> Rompilla still would not be entitled to relief. The Court is able to conclude otherwise only by ignoring the established principle that it is the defendant, not the State, who has the burden of demonstrating that he was prejudiced by any deficiency in his attorneys' performance.</p>\n<p>These are the reasons for my dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Under any standard of review the investigation performed by Rompilla's counsel in preparation for sentencing was not only adequate but also conscientious.</p>\n<p>Rompilla's attorneys recognized from the outset that building an effective mitigation case was crucial to helping their client avoid the death penalty. App. 516, 576. Rompilla stood accused of a brutal crime. In January 1988, James Scanlon was murdered while he was closing the Cozy Corner Cafe, a bar he owned in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Scanlon's body was discovered later the next morning, lying in a pool of blood. Scanlon had been stabbed multiple times, including 16 wounds around the neck and head. Scanlon also had been beaten with a blunt object, and his face had been gashed, possibly with shards from broken liquor and beer bottles found at the scene of the crime. After Scanlon was stabbed to death his body had been set on fire.</p>\n<p>Substantial evidence linked Rompilla to the crime. See generally <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Rompilla,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2011060\"><a href=\"/opinion/2011060/com-v-rompilla/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 505-506, 653 A. 2d 626, 629-630 (1995). He was at the Cozy Corner Cafe near closing time on the night of the murder and was observed going to the bathroom approximately 10 times during <span class=\"star-pagination\">*398</span> a 1-hour period. A window in that bathroom, the police later determined, was the probable point of entry used by Scanlon's assailant. A pair of Rompilla's sneakers seized by the police matched a bloody footprint found near the victim's body, and blood on the sneakers matched the victim's blood type. Rompilla's fingerprint was found on one of the two knives used to commit the murder. Sometime after leaving the bar on the night of the murder, Rompilla checked into a nearby motel under a false name. Although he told the police he left the bar with only two dollars, Rompilla had paid cash for the room and flashed a large amount of money to the desk clerks. The victim's wallet was discovered in the bushes just outside of Rompilla's motel room. When the police questioned Rompilla about the murder, his version of events was inconsistent with the testimony of other witnesses.</p>\n<p>Rompilla was represented at trial by Fredrick Charles, the chief public defender for Lehigh County at the time, and Maria Dantos, an assistant public defender. Charles and Dantos were assisted by John Whispell, an investigator in the public defender's office. Rompilla's defense team sought to develop mitigating evidence from various sources. First, they questioned Rompilla extensively about his upbringing and background. App. 668-669. To make these conversations more productive they provided Rompilla with a list of the mitigating circumstances recognized by Pennsylvania law. <i>Id.,</i> at 657. Cf. <i>Strickland, supra,</i> at 691 (\"[W]hen a defendant has given counsel reason to believe that pursuing certain investigations would be fruitless or even harmful, counsel's failure to pursue those investigations may not later be challenged as unreasonable\"). Second, Charles and Dantos arranged for Rompilla to be examined by three experienced mental health professionals, experts described by Charles as \"the best forensic psychiatrist around here, [another] tremendous psychiatrist and a fabulous forensic psychologist.\" App. 672. Finally, Rompilla's attorneys questioned <span class=\"star-pagination\">*399</span> his family extensively in search of any information that might help spare Rompilla the death penalty. <i>Id.,</i> at 493-494, 557-558, 669-670, 729-730. Dantos, in particular, developed a \"very close\" relationship with Rompilla's family, which was a \"constant source of information.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 557, 729. Indeed, after trial Rompilla's wife sent Dantos a letter expressing her gratitude. <i>Id.,</i> at 733. The letter referred to Charles and Dantos as \"superb human beings\" who \"fought and felt everything [Rompilla's] family did.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Court acknowledges the steps taken by Rompilla's attorneys in preparation for sentencing but finds fault nonetheless. \"[T]he lawyers were deficient,\" the Court says, \"in failing to examine the court file on Rompilla's prior conviction.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 383.</p>\n<p>The prior conviction the Court refers to is Rompilla's 1974 conviction for rape, burglary, and theft. See <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Rompilla,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2358486\"><a href=\"/opinion/2358486/com-v-rompilla/\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa. Super.</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 378 A. 2d 865 (1977). Before the sentencing phase of the capital case, the Commonwealth informed Rompilla's attorneys that it intended to use these prior crimes to prove one of the statutory aggravating circumstances \u0097 namely, that Rompilla had a \"significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person.\" 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 9711(d)(9) (2002). Rompilla's attorneys were on notice of the Commonwealth's plans, and from this the Court concludes that effective assistance of counsel required a review of the prior conviction case file.</p>\n<p>A <i>per se</i> rule requiring counsel in every case to review the records of prior convictions used by the State as aggravation evidence is a radical departure from <i>Strickland</i> and its progeny. We have warned in the past against the creation of \"specific guidelines\" or \"checklist[s] for judicial evaluation of attorney performance.\" 466 U. S., at 688. See also <i>Wiggins</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> 539 U. S. 510, 521 (2003); <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Flores-Ortega,</i> 528 U. S. 470, 477 (2000). \"No particular set of detailed rules for counsel's conduct can satisfactorily take account of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*400</span> the variety of circumstances faced by defense counsel or the range of legitimate decisions regarding how best to represent a criminal defendant. Any such set of rules would interfere with the constitutionally protected independence of counsel and restrict the wide latitude counsel must have in making tactical decisions. Indeed, the existence of detailed guidelines for representation could distract counsel from the overriding mission of vigorous advocacy of the defendant's cause.\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U. S., at 688-689 (citations omitted). For this reason, while we have referred to the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice as a useful point of reference, we have been careful to say these standards \"are only guides\" and do not establish the constitutional baseline for effective assistance of counsel. <i>Ibid.</i> The majority, by parsing the guidelines as if they were binding statutory text, ignores this admonition.</p>\n<p>The majority's analysis contains barely a mention of <i>Strickland</i> and makes little effort to square today's holding with our traditional reluctance to impose rigid requirements on defense counsel. While the Court disclaims any intention to create a bright-line rule, <i>ante,</i> at 389-390; see also <i>ante,</i> at 393-394 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring), this affords little comfort. The Court's opinion makes clear it has imposed on counsel a broad obligation to review prior conviction case files where those priors are used in aggravation \u0097 and to review every document in those files if not every single page of every document, regardless of the prosecution's proposed use for the prior conviction. <i>Infra,</i> at 403, 407-408. One Member of the majority tries to limit the Court's new rule by arguing that counsel's decision here was \"not the result of an informed tactical decision,\" <i>ante,</i> at 395 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring), but the record gives no support for this notion. The Court also protests that the exceptional weight Rompilla's attorneys at sentencing placed on residual doubt required them to review the prior conviction file, <i>ante,</i> at 389-390; <i>ante,</i> at 394-395 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring). In fact, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*401</span> residual doubt was not central to Rompilla's mitigation case. Rompilla's family members did testify at sentencing that they thought he was innocent, but Dantos tried to draw attention away from this point and instead use the family's testimony to humanize Rompilla and ask for mercy. App. 123-149.</p>\n<p>The majority also disregards the sound strategic calculation supporting the decisions made by Rompilla's attorneys. Charles and Dantos were \"aware of [Rompilla's] priors\" and \"aware of the circumstances\" surrounding these convictions. <i>Id.,</i> at 507. At the post-conviction hearing, Dantos also indicated that she had reviewed documents relating to the prior conviction. <i>Ibid.</i> Based on this information, as well as their numerous conversations with Rompilla and his family, Charles and Dantos reasonably could conclude that reviewing the full prior conviction case file was not the best allocation of resources.</p>\n<p>The majority concludes otherwise only by ignoring <i>Strickland</i>'s command that \"[j]udicial scrutiny of counsel's performance must be highly deferential.\" 466 U. S., at 689. According to the Court, the Constitution required nothing less than a full review of the prior conviction case file by Rompilla's attorneys. Even with the benefit of hindsight the Court struggles to explain how the file would have proved helpful, offering only the vague speculation that Rompilla's attorneys might have discovered \"circumstances extenuating the behavior described by the [rape] victim.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 386. What the Court means by \"circumstances\" is a mystery. If the Court is referring to details on Rompilla's mental fitness or upbringing, surely Rompilla's attorneys were more likely to discover such information through the sources they consulted: Rompilla; his family; and the three mental health experts that examined him.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the circumstances to which the majority refers are the details of Rompilla's 1974 crimes. Charles and Dantos, however, had enough information about the prior <span class=\"star-pagination\">*402</span> convictions to determine that reviewing the case file was not the most effective use of their time. Rompilla had been convicted of breaking into the residence of Josephine Macrenna, who lived in an apartment above the bar she owned. App. 56-89. After Macrenna gave him the bar's receipts for the night, Rompilla demanded that she disrobe. When she initially resisted, Rompilla slashed her left breast with a knife. Rompilla then held Macrenna at knife-point while he raped her for over an hour. Charles and Dantos were aware of these circumstances of the prior conviction and the brutality of the crime. <i>Id.,</i> at 507. It did not take a review of the case file to know that quibbling with the Commonwealth's version of events was a dubious trial strategy. At sentencing Dantos fought vigorously to prevent the Commonwealth from introducing the details of the 1974 crimes, <i>id.,</i> at 16-40, but once the transcript was admitted there was nothing that could be done. Rompilla was unlikely to endear himself to the jury by arguing that his prior conviction for burglary, theft, and rape really was not as bad as the Commonwealth was making it out to be. Recognizing this, Rompilla's attorneys instead devoted their limited time and resources to developing a mitigation case. That those efforts turned up little useful evidence does not make the <i>ex ante</i> strategic calculation of Rompilla's attorneys constitutionally deficient.</p>\n<p>One of the primary reasons this Court has rejected a checklist approach to effective assistance of counsel is that each new requirement risks distracting attorneys from the real objective of providing vigorous advocacy as dictated by the facts and circumstances in the particular case. The Court's rigid requirement that counsel always review the case files of convictions the prosecution seeks to use at trial will be just such a distraction. Capital defendants often have a history of crime. For example, as of 2003, 64 percent of inmates on death row had prior felony convictions. U. S. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, T. Bonczar &amp; T. Snell, Capital Punishment, 2003, p. 8 (Nov. 2004), available <span class=\"star-pagination\">*403</span> at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cp03.pdf (as visited June 16, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). If the prosecution relies on these convictions as aggravators, the Court has now obligated defense attorneys to review the boxes of documents that come with them.</p>\n<p>In imposing this new rule, the Court states that counsel in this case could review the \"entire file\" with \"ease.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 386, n. 4. There is simply no support in the record for this assumption. Case files often comprise numerous boxes. The file may contain, among other things, witness statements, forensic evidence, arrest reports, grand jury transcripts, testimony and exhibits relating to any pretrial suppression hearings, trial transcripts, trial exhibits, post-trial motions, and presentence reports. Full review of even a single prior conviction case file could be time consuming, and many of the documents in a file are duplicative or irrelevant. The Court, recognizing the flaw in its analysis, suggests that cases involving \"warehouses of records\" \"will call for greater subtlety.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Yet for all we know, this is such a case. As to the time component, the Court tells us nothing as to the number of hours counsel had available to prepare for sentencing or why the decisions they made in allocating their time were so flawed as to constitute deficient performance under <i>Strickland.</i></p>\n<p>Today's decision will not increase the resources committed to capital defense. (At the time of Rompilla's trial, the Lehigh County Public Defender's Office had two investigators for 2,000 cases. App. 662.) If defense attorneys dutifully comply with the Court's new rule, they will have to divert resources from other tasks. The net effect of today's holding in many cases \u0097 instances where trial counsel reasonably can conclude that reviewing old case files is not an effective use of time \u0097 will be to diminish the quality of representation. We have \"consistently declined to impose mechanical rules on counsel \u0097 even when those rules might lead to better representation,\" <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Flores-Ortega,</i> 528 U. S., at 481; I see <span class=\"star-pagination\">*404</span> no occasion to depart from this approach in order to impose a requirement that might well lead to worse representation.</p>\n<p>It is quite possible defense attorneys, recognizing the absurdity of a one-size-fits-all approach to effective advocacy, will simply ignore the Court's new requirement and continue to exercise their best judgment about how to allocate time and resources in preparation for trial. While this decision would be understandable \u0097 and might even be required by state ethical rules, cf. Pa. Rules of Professional Conduct, Preamble, and Rule 1.1 (2005) \u0097 it leaves open the possibility that a defendant will seek to overturn his conviction based on something in a prior conviction case file that went unreviewed. This elevation of needle-in-a-haystack claims to the status of constitutional violations will benefit undeserving defendants and saddle States with the considerable costs of retrial and/or resentencing.</p>\n<p>Today's decision is wrong under any standard, but the Court's error is compounded by the fact that this case arises on federal habeas. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court adjudicated Rompilla's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim on the merits, and this means 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254(d)'s deferential standard of review applies. Rompilla must show that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision was not just \"incorrect or erroneous,\" but \"objectively unreasonable.\" <i>Lockyer</i> v. <i>Andrade,</i> 538 U. S. 63, 75 (2003) (citing <i>Williams</i> v. <i>Taylor,</i> 529 U. S. 362, 410, 412 (2000)). He cannot do so.</p>\n<p>The Court pays lipservice to the <i>Williams</i> standard, but it proceeds to adopt a rigid, <i>per se</i> obligation that binds counsel in every case and finds little support in our precedents. Indeed, <i>Strickland,</i> the case the Court purports to apply, is directly to the contrary: \"Most important, in adjudicating a claim of actual ineffectiveness of counsel, a court should keep in mind that the principles we have stated do not establish mechanical rules.\" 466 U. S., at 696. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court gave careful consideration to Rompilla's Sixth Amendment claim and concluded that \"counsel reasonably <span class=\"star-pagination\">*405</span> relied upon their discussions with [Rompilla] and upon their experts to determine the records needed to evaluate his mental health and other potential mitigating circumstances.\" <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Rompilla,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></span>, 385-386, 721 A. 2d 786, 790 (1998). This decision was far from unreasonable. The Pennsylvania courts can hardly be faulted for failing to anticipate today's abrupt departure from <i>Strickland.</i></p>\n<p>We have reminded federal courts often of the need to show the requisite level of deference to state-court judgments under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254(d). <i>Holland</i> v. <i>Jackson,</i> 542 U. S. 649 (2004) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>Middleton</i> v. <i>McNeil,</i> 541 U. S. 433 (2004) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>Yarborough</i> v. <i>Gentry,</i> 540 U. S. 1 (2003) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>Mitchell</i> v. <i>Esparza,</i> 540 U. S. 12 (2003) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>Early</i> v. <i>Packer,</i> 537 U. S. 3 (2002) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>Woodford</i> v. <i>Visciotti,</i> 537 U. S. 19 (2002) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> By ignoring our own admonition today, the Court adopts a do-as-we-say, not-as-we-do approach to federal habeas review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Even accepting the Court's misguided analysis of the adequacy of representation by Rompilla's trial counsel, Rompilla is still not entitled to habeas relief. <i>Strickland</i> assigns the defendant the burden of demonstrating prejudice, 466 U. S., at 692. Rompilla cannot satisfy this standard, and only through a remarkable leap can the Court conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p>The Court's theory of prejudice rests on serendipity. Nothing in the old case file diminishes the aggravating nature of the prior conviction. The only way Rompilla's attorneys could have minimized the aggravating force of the earlier rape conviction was through Dantos' forceful, but ultimately unsuccessful, fight to exclude the transcript at sentencing. The Court, recognizing this problem, instead finds prejudice through chance. If Rompilla's attorneys had reviewed the case file of his prior rape and burglary conviction, the Court says, they would have stumbled across \"a range of mitigation leads.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 390.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*406</span> The range of leads to which the Court refers is in fact a handful of notations within a single 10-page document. The document, an \"Initial Transfer Petition,\" appears to have been prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections after Rompilla's conviction to facilitate his initial assignment to one of the Commonwealth's maximum-security prisons. Lodging to App. 31-40.</p>\n<p>Rompilla cannot demonstrate prejudice because nothing in the record indicates that Rompilla's trial attorneys would have discovered the transfer petition, or the clues contained in it, if they had reviewed the old file. The majority faults Rompilla's attorneys for failing to \"learn what the Commonwealth knew about the crime,\" \"discover any mitigating evidence the Commonwealth would downplay,\" and \"anticipate the details of the aggravating evidence the Commonwealth would emphasize.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 385-386. Yet if Rompilla's attorneys had reviewed the case file with these purposes in mind, they almost surely would have attributed no significance to the transfer petition following only a cursory review. The petition, after all, was prepared by the Department of Corrections after Rompilla's conviction for the purpose of determining Rompilla's initial prison assignment. It contained no details regarding the circumstances of the conviction. Reviewing the prior conviction file for information to counter the Commonwealth, counsel would have looked first at the transcript of the trial testimony, and perhaps then to probative exhibits or forensic evidence. There would have been no reason for counsel to read, or even to skim, this obscure document.</p>\n<p>The Court claims that the transfer petition would have been discovered because it was in the \"same file\" with the transcript, <i>ante,</i> at 391, but this characterization is misleading and the conclusion the Court draws from it is accordingly fallacious. The record indicates only that the transfer petition was a part of the same case file, but Rompilla provides no indication of the size of the file, which for all we know <span class=\"star-pagination\">*407</span> originally comprised several boxes of documents. App. 508, 571, 631. By the time of Rompilla's state post-conviction hearing, moreover, the transfer petition was not stored in any \"file\" at all \u0097 it had been transferred to microfilm. <i>Id.,</i> at 461. The Court implies in a footnote that prejudice can be presumed because \"Pennsylvania has conspicuously failed to contest Rompilla's\" inevitable-discovery argument. <i>Ante,</i> at 391, n. 8. The Commonwealth's strategy is unsurprising given that discussion of the prior conviction case file takes up only one paragraph of Rompilla's argument, Brief for Petitioner 35-36, but it is also irrelevant. It is well established that Rompilla, not the Commonwealth, has the burden of establishing prejudice. <i>Strickland, supra,</i> at 694.</p>\n<p>The majority thus finds itself in a bind. If counsel's alleged deficiency lies in the failure to review the file for the purposes the majority has identified, then there is no prejudice: for there is no reasonable probability that review of the file for those purposes would have led counsel to accord the transfer petition enough attention to discover the leads the majority cites. Prejudice could only be demonstrated if the deficiency in counsel's performance were to be described not as the failure to perform a purposive review of the file, but instead as the failure to accord intense scrutiny to every single page of every single document in that file, regardless of the purpose motivating the review. At times, the Court hints that its new obligation on counsel sweeps this broadly. See <i>ante,</i> at 386, n. 4 (\"The ease with which counsel could examine the entire file . . .\"); <i>ante,</i> at 386, n. 5 (\"[C]ounsel had no way of knowing the context of the transcript and the details of the prior conviction without looking at the file as a whole\"). Surely, however, the Court would not require defense counsel to look at every document, no matter how tangential, included in the prior conviction file on the off chance that some notation therein might provide a lead, which in turn might result in the discovery of useful information. The Constitution does not mandate that defense attorneys <span class=\"star-pagination\">*408</span> perform busy work. This rigid requirement would divert counsel's limited time and energy away from more important tasks. In this way, it would ultimately disserve the rationale underlying the Court's new rule, which is to ensure that defense counsel counter the State's aggravation case effectively.</p>\n<p>If the Court does intend to impose on counsel a constitutional obligation to review every page of every document included in the case file of a prior conviction, then today's holding is even more misguided than I imagined.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p><i>Strickland</i> anticipated the temptation \"to second-guess counsel's assistance after conviction or adverse sentence\" and cautioned that \"[a] fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the time.\" 466 U. S., at 689. Today, the Court succumbs to the very temptation that <i>Strickland</i> warned against. In the process, the majority imposes on defense attorneys a rigid requirement that finds no support in our cases or common sense.</p>\n<p>I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for the American Bar Association by <i>Robert J. Grey, Jr., Terri L. Mascherin,</i> and <i>Jared O. Freedman;</i> and for the Friends of Ronald A. Rompilla by <i>James Joseph Lynch, Jr.</i>\n</p>\n<p><i>Kent S. Scheidegger</i> filed a brief for the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation as <i>amicus curiae</i> urging affirmance.</p>\n<p><i>Audrey J. Anderson, Christopher M. Miller,</i> and <i>Pamela Harris</i> filed a brief for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as <i>amicus curiae.</i></p>\n<p>[1]  Because we reverse on ineffective-assistance grounds, we have no occasion to consider Rompilla's other claim, under <i>Simmons</i> v. <i>South Carolina,</i> 512 U. S. 154 (1994). It is enough to say that any retrial of Rompilla's sentence will be governed by the <i>Simmons</i> line of cases.</p>\n<p>[2]  A similar exchange took place at the same hearing about the indictment in the record of Rompilla's prior conviction.\n</p>\n<p>\"[DEFENSE]: Well, I think we need to look at the Indictment then. If he's charged with committing the Burglary\u0097</p>\n<p>.      .      .      .      .</p>\n<p>\"[PROSECUTOR]: I had a copy, and I forgot to bring it up with me.</p>\n<p>\"[COURT]: All right.</p>\n<p>\"[DEFENSE]: Can we see it, Judge?</p>\n<p>\"[COURT]: Sure, he's going to get it.</p>\n<p>\"[PROSECUTOR]: It's a public record . . . you could have gone over <i>[sic]</i> lunch and looked at it just like I did.\" App. 28.</p>\n<p>[3]  Defense counsel also stated at the postconviction hearing that she believed at some point she had looked at some files regarding that prior conviction and that she was familiar with the particulars of the case. But she could not recall what the files were or how she obtained them. <i>Id.,</i> at 507-508. In addition, counsel apparently obtained Rompilla's rap sheet, which showed that he had prior convictions, including the one for rape. <i>Id.,</i> at 664. At oral argument, the United States, arguing as an <i>amicus</i> in support of Pennsylvania, maintained that counsel had fulfilled their obligations to investigate the prior conviction by obtaining the rap sheet. Tr. of Oral Arg. 44-45. But this cannot be so. The rap sheet would reveal only the charges and dispositions, being no reasonable substitute for the prior conviction file. The dissent nonetheless concludes on this evidence that counsel knew all they needed to know about the prior conviction. <i>Post,</i> at 401 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Given counsel's limited investigation into the prior conviction, the dissent's parsing of the record seems generous to a fault.</p>\n<p>[4]  The ease with which counsel could examine the entire file makes application of this standard correspondingly easy. Suffice it to say that when the State has warehouses of records available in a particular case, review of counsel's performance will call for greater subtlety.</p>\n<p>[5]  This requirement answers the dissent's and the United States's contention that defense counsel provided effective assistance with regard to the prior conviction file because it argued that it would be prejudicial to allow the introduction of the transcript. <i>Post,</i> at 402; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 29. Counsel's obligation to rebut aggravating evidence extended beyond arguing it ought to be kept out. As noted above, <i>supra</i> this page, counsel had no way of knowing the context of the transcript and the details of the prior conviction without looking at the file as a whole. Counsel could not effectively rebut the aggravation case or build their own case in mitigation.\n</p>\n<p>Nor is there any merit to the United States's contention that further enquiry into the prior conviction file would have been fruitless because the sole reason the transcript was being introduced was to establish the aggravator that Rompilla had committed prior violent felonies. Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 30. The Government maintains that because the transcript would incontrovertibly establish the fact that Rompilla had committed a violent felony, the defense could not have expected to rebut that aggravator through further investigation of the file. That analysis ignores the fact that the sentencing jury was required to weigh aggravating factors against mitigating factors. We may reasonably assume that the jury could give more relative weight to a prior violent felony aggravator where defense counsel missed an opportunity to argue that circumstances of the prior conviction were less damning than the prosecution's characterization of the conviction would suggest.</p>\n<p>[6]  The new version of the Standards now reads that any \"investigation should include efforts to secure information in the possession of the prosecution and law enforcement authorities\" whereas the version in effect at the time of Rompilla's trial provided that the \"investigation\" should always include such efforts. ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Prosecution Function and Defense Function 4-4.1 (3d ed. 1993). We see no material difference between these two phrasings, and in any case cannot think of any situation in which defense counsel should not make some effort to learn the information in the possession of the prosecution and law enforcement authorities.</p>\n<p>[7]  In 1989, shortly after Rompilla's trial, the ABA promulgated a set of guidelines specifically devoted to setting forth the obligations of defense counsel in death penalty cases. ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases (1989) (hereinafter 1989 ABA Guidelines or Guideline). Those Guidelines applied the clear requirements for investigation set forth in the earlier Standards to death penalty cases and imposed a similarly forceful directive: \"Counsel should make efforts to secure information in the possession of the prosecution or law enforcement authorities, including police reports.\" Guideline 11.4.1.D.4. When the United States argues that Rompilla's defense counsel complied with these Guidelines, it focuses its attentions on a different Guideline, 11.4.1.D.2. Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 20-21. Guideline 11.4.1.D.2 concerns practices for working with the defendant and potential witnesses, and the United States contends that it imposes no requirement to obtain any one particular type of record or information. <i>Ibid.</i> But this argument ignores the subsequent Guideline quoted above, which is in fact reprinted in the appendix to the United States's brief, that requires counsel to \"`make efforts to secure information in the possession of the prosecution or law enforcement authorities.'\" App. to <i>id.,</i> at 4a.\n</p>\n<p>Later, and current, ABA Guidelines relating to death penalty defense are even more explicit:</p>\n<p>\"Counsel must . . . investigate prior convictions . . . that could be used as aggravating circumstances or otherwise come into evidence. If a prior conviction is legally flawed, counsel should seek to have it set aside. Counsel may also find extenuating circumstances that can be offered to lessen the weight of a conviction.\" ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases 10.7, comment. (rev. ed. 2003), reprinted in 31 Hofstra L. Rev. 913, 1027 (2003) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p>Our decision in <i>Wiggins</i> made precisely the same point in citing the earlier 1989 ABA Guidelines. 539 U. S., at 524 (\"The ABA Guidelines provide that investigations into mitigating evidence `should comprise efforts to discover <i>all reasonably available</i> mitigating evidence and evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced by the prosecutor'\" (quoting 1989 ABA Guideline 11.4.1.C (emphasis in original))). For reasons given in the text, no such further investigation was needed to point to the reasonable duty to look in the file in question here.</p>\n<p>[8]  The dissent would ignore the opportunity to find this evidence on the ground that its discovery (and the consequent analysis of prejudice) \"rests on serendipity,\" <i>post,</i> at 405. But once counsel had an obligation to examine the file, counsel had to make reasonable efforts to learn its contents; and once having done so, they could not reasonably have ignored mitigation evidence or red flags simply because they were unexpected. The dissent, however, assumes that counsel could reasonably decline even to read what was in the file, see <i>post,</i> at 406 (if counsel had reviewed the case file for mitigating evidence, \"[t]here would have been no reason for counsel to read, or even to skim, this obscure document\"). While that could well have been true if counsel had been faced with a large amount of possible evidence, see n. 4, <i>supra,</i> there is no indication that examining the case file in question here would have required significant labor. Indeed, Pennsylvania has conspicuously failed to contest Rompilla's claim that because the information was located in the prior conviction file, reasonable efforts would have led counsel to this information.</p>\n\n</div>",
