S. C. § 3731(b)(1), governs FCA civil actions for retaliation, see § 3730(h). We hold that it does not and therefore conclude that the most closely analogous state limitations period applies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The FCA prohibits any person from making false or fraudulent claims for payment to the United States. § 3729(a). Persons who do so are liable for civil penalties of up to $10,000 per claim and treble damages. <i>Ibid.</i> The Act sets forth two principal enforcement mechanisms for policing this proscription. First, the Attorney General may sue to remedy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*412</span> violations of § 3729. § 3730(a). Second, private individuals may bring <i>qui tam</i> actions in the Government's name for § 3729 violations. § 3730(b)(1); see <i>Vermont Agency of Natural Resources</i> v. <i>United States ex rel. Stevens,</i> 529 U. S. 765, 769-772 (2000). The <i>qui tam</i> relator must give the Government notice of the action, and the Government is entitled to intervene in the suit. § 3730(b)(2). The relator receives up to 30 percent of the proceeds of the action, in addition to attorney's fees and costs. §§ 3730(d)(1), (2).</p>\n<p>The 1986 amendments to the FCA created a third enforcement mechanism: a private cause of action for an individual retaliated against by his employer for assisting an FCA investigation or proceeding. § 3730(h). Section 3730(h) provides in relevant part that</p>\n<blockquote>\"[a]ny employee who is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment by his or her employer because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the employee or others in furtherance of an action under this section, including investigation for, initiation of, testimony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this section, shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee whole.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Remedies for retaliation include reinstatement, two times the amount of back-pay plus interest, special damages, litigation costs, and attorney's fees. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The 1986 amendments also revised the language of the 6-year statute of limitations applicable to FCA actions. The previous version of the statute provided that \"[a] civil action under section 3730 of this title must be brought within 6 years from the date the violation is committed.\" § 3731(b) (1982 ed.). The 1986 amendments revised this provision to read:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*413</span> \"(b) A civil action under section 3730 may not be brought </blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) more than 6 years after the date on which the violation of section 3729 is committed, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) more than 3 years after the date when facts material to the right of action are known or reasonably should have been known by the official of the United States charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances, but in no event more than 10 years after the date on which the violation is committed . . . .\" § 3731 (2000 ed.).</blockquote>\n<p>In January 2001, relator Karen T. Wilson brought an FCA <i>qui tam</i> and retaliation action against petitioners. Petitioners Graham County Soil and Water Conservation District and Cherokee County Soil and Water Conservation District are special-purpose local government entities; the other petitioners are various local and federal officials. Graham County District employed Wilson as a secretary. Wilson alleged that petitioners made numerous false claims for payment to the United States in connection with a federal disaster relief program, the Emergency Watershed Protection Program, App. 17-20, and in connection with agricultural programs administered by North Carolina but funded by the Federal Government, <i>id.,</i> at 17-24.</p>\n<p>Wilson contended, in addition, that Graham County District officials retaliated against her for aiding federal officials in their investigation of these false claims. <i>Id.,</i> at 25-30. Wilson alerted federal officials to petitioners' suspected fraudulent activities in December 1995 and cooperated with the ensuing investigation. <i>Id.,</i> at 26-27. Because of her cooperation, the complaint alleged, Graham County District officials repeatedly harassed her from 1996 to 1997, eventually inducing her to resign in March 1997. <i>Id.,</i> at 28-30.</p>\n<p>Petitioners successfully moved to dismiss Wilson's retaliation action as untimely. They argued that the 6-year limitations period provided in § 3731(b)(1) did not apply to Wilson's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*414</span> retaliation action. Absent an applicable federal limitations period, they asked the District Court to borrow North Carolina's 3-year statute of limitations for retaliatory-discharge actions. The District Court agreed and dismissed the retaliation claim, since Wilson filed it more than three years after her March 1997 discharge. App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a-70a. The court certified that ruling for interlocutory appeal. 224 F. Supp. 2d 1042, 1050-1051 (WDNC 2002).</p>\n<p>On interlocutory appeal, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed. In the majority's view, the plain language of § 3731(b)(1) supplies a limitations period for retaliation actions, making it unnecessary to borrow one from North Carolina law. The court reasoned that § 3731(b)(1) governs § 3730(h) retaliation actions, because it applies its 6-year limitations period to \"`[a] civil action under section 3730.\" 367 F. 3d 245, 251 (2004) (brackets in original).</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari to resolve a disagreement among the Courts of Appeals regarding whether § 3731(b)(1)'s 6-year statute of limitations applies to § 3730(h) retaliation actions or whether, instead, the most closely analogous state limitations period governs. 543 U. S. 1042 (2005). Compare <i>Neal</i> v. <i>Honeywell Inc.,</i> 33 F. 3d 860, 865-866 (CA7 1994) (holding that FCA 6-year period applies), with <i>United States ex rel. Lujan</i> v. <i>Hughes Aircraft Co.,</i> 162 F. 3d 1027, 1034-1035 (CA9 1998) (holding that most closely analogous state limitations period governs).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>To determine the applicable statute of limitations for a cause of action created by a federal statute, we first ask whether the statute expressly supplies a limitations period. If it does not, we generally \"borrow\" the most closely analogous state limitations period. See <i>North Star Steel Co.</i> v. <i>Thomas,</i> 515 U. S. 29, 33-34 (1995); <i>Reed</i> v. <i>Transportation Union,</i> 488 U. S. 319, 324 (1989); <i>Agency Holding Corp.</i> v. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*415</span> <i>Malley-Duff &amp; Associates, Inc.,</i> 483 U. S. 143, 157-165 (1987) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (tracing history of borrowing state limitations periods). In the rare case, we have even borrowed analogous federal limitations periods in the absence of an expressly applicable one, see, <i>e. g., id.,</i> at 150-157, but no party points to a reason why we should do so here, and we can think of none. The only arguably applicable express statute of limitations is the 6-year limit set forth in § 3731(b)(1). The question, then, is whether § 3731(b)(1) applies by its terms to retaliation actions under § 3730(h); if it does not, our cases dictate that the most closely analogous state limitations period applies.</p>\n<p>Under § 3731(b)(1), \"[a] civil action under section 3730 may not be brought ... more than 6 years after the date on which the violation of section 3729 is committed.\" Following the Court of Appeals' lead and supported by the United States appearing as <i>amicus curiae,</i> Wilson argues that this language unambiguously applies to FCA retaliation actions. She points out that § 3731(b)(1) applies a 6-year limitations period to \"a civil action under section 3730,\" and that § 3730(h) actions arise under § 3730; hence, she claims, the 6-year period governs § 3730(h) actions. See <i>Neal, supra,</i> at 865-866 (arguing same). We think the statute is more complex than this argument supposes. Statutory language has meaning only in context, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Leocal</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 543 U. S. 1, 9 (2004), and § 3731(b)(1), read in its proper context, does not govern § 3730(h) actions for retaliation.</p>\n<p>Section 3731(b)(1) is ambiguous, rather than clear, about whether a § 3730(h) retaliation action is \"a civil action under section 3730.\" Another reasonable reading is that it applies only to actions arising under §§ 3730(a) and (b), not to § 3730(h) retaliation actions. That reading is suggested by the language in § 3731(b)(1) tying the start of the time limit to \"the date on which the violation of section 3729 is committed.\" In other words, the time limit begins to run on the date the defendant submitted a false claim for payment. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*416</span> See <i>supra,</i> at 412-413. This language casts doubt on whether § 3731(b)(1) specifies a limitations period for retaliation actions. For even a well-pleaded retaliation complaint need not allege that the defendant submitted a false claim, leaving the limitations period without a starting point if § 3731(b)(1) is applicable. A retaliation plaintiff, instead, need prove only that the defendant retaliated against him for engaging in \"lawful acts done . . . in furtherance of\" an FCA \"action filed or to be filed,\" § 3730(h), language that protects an employee's conduct even if the target of an investigation or action to be filed was innocent.<sup>[1]</sup> Applying § 3731(b)(1) to FCA retaliation actions, then, sits uneasily with § 3731(b)(1)'s language, which assumes that well-pleaded \"action[s] under section 3730\" to which it is applicable include a \"violation of section 3729\" certain from which to start the time running. Section 3731(b)(1), by contrast, naturally applies to well-pleaded §§ 3730(a) and (b) actions. They require the plaintiff to plead that the defendant submitted a false claim for payment, and therefore necessarily specify when § 3731(b)(1)'s time limit begins. This textual anomaly, at a minimum, shows that § 3731(b)(1) is ambiguous about whether \"action under section 3730\" means all actions under § 3730, or only §§ 3730(a) and (b) actions.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*417</span> Wilson and the United States dispute that the statute contains this anomaly, and instead urge that it clearly applies by its terms to all § 3730 actions. They point out that every § 3730(h) action requires the plaintiff to prove that he engaged in protected conduct related to at least a <i>suspected</i> violation of § 3729, and argue that § 3731(b)(1)'s limitations period simply begins to run on the date of the suspected violation. Assuming, without deciding, that § 3730(h) retaliation actions have as an element a suspected violation of § 3729, their interpretation indeed removes the anomaly, but only at the cost of reading into the statute the word \"suspected\" before the phrase \"violation of section 3729.\" Section 3731(b)(1) speaks of \"violation[s] of section 3729\"  <i>actual,</i> not <i>suspected,</i> ones. Wilson and the United States answer that this argument proves too much, because even §§ 3730(a) and (b) actions involve only \"suspected\" violations of § 3729 at the pleading stage of litigation; but this response misses the point. Every § 3730(a) or (b) plaintiff who states or proves a valid claim for relief must allege or prove an actual violation of § 3729; retaliation plaintiffs need only allege or prove a suspected violation of § 3729 (or so we are willing to assume). The point is that § 3731(b)(1)'s language applies naturally to all successfully pleaded or proved retaliation actions only if one reads \"suspected\" into its terms, as the dissent essentially concedes. See <i>post,</i> at 425-426 (opinion of BREYER, J.).</p>\n<p>Section 3731(b)(1)'s literal text, then, is ambiguous. Wilson and the Government ask us to read it as if it said \"the [suspected or actual] violation of section 3729.\" Petitioners ask us to read § 3731(b) as if it said \"civil action under section 3730[(a) or (b)].\"</p>\n<p>Two considerations convince us that the better way to resolve this ambiguity is to read the 6-year period to govern only §§ 3730(a) and (b) actions, and not § 3730(h) retaliation actions. First, the very next subsection of the statute, § 3731(c), also uses the similarly unqualified phrase \"action <span class=\"star-pagination\">*418</span> brought under section 3730\" to refer only to §§ 3730(a) and (b) actions. Section 3731(c) provides that \"[i]n any action brought under section 3730, the United States shall be required to prove all essential elements of the cause of action, including damages, by a preponderance of the evidence.\" As Wilson and the United States concede, the context of this provision implies that the phrase \"any action brought under section 3730\" is limited to § 3730(a) actions brought by the United States and § 3730(b) actions in which the United States intervenes as a party, as those are the types of § 3730 actions in which the United States necessarily participates. Otherwise, the United States would be \"required to prove all essential elements of the cause of action,\" § 3731(c), in all § 3730 actions, regardless of whether it participated in the action (a consequence the dissent implicitly embraces by claiming that \"any action brought under section 3730\" in § 3731(c) means all § 3730 actions, see <i>post,</i> at 423-424 (opinion of BREYER, J.)). This implicit limitation of the phrase \"action under section 3730\" shows that Congress used the term \"action under section 3730\" imprecisely in § 3731 and, in particular, that Congress sometimes used the term to refer only to a subset of § 3730 actions. It is reasonable to read the same language in § 3731(b)(1) to be likewise limited.</p>\n<p>Second, reading § 3731(b)(1) to apply only to §§ 3730(a) and (b) actions is in keeping with the default rule that Congress generally drafts statutes of limitations to begin when the cause of action accrues. We have repeatedly recognized that Congress legislates against the \"standard rule that the limitations period commences when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.\" <i>Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund</i> v. <i>Ferbar Corp. of Cal.,</i> 522 U. S. 192, 201 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 544 U. S. 295, 305 (2005) (calling it \"highly doubtful\" that Congress intended a time limit on pursuing a claim to expire before the claim arose); <i>Reiter</i> v. <i>Cooper,</i> 507 U. S. 258, 267 (1993) (declining to countenance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*419</span> the \"odd result\" that a federal cause of action and statute of limitations arise at different times \"absen[t] . . . any such indication in the statute\"); <i>TRW Inc.</i> v. <i>Andrews,</i> 534 U. S. 19, 37 (2001) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (\"Absent other indication, a statute of limitations begins to run at the time the plaintiff has the right to apply to the court for relief\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Therefore, where, as the case is here, there are two plausible constructions of a statute of limitations, we should adopt the construction that starts the time limit running when the cause of action (here retaliation) accrues.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>This approach resolves the ambiguity in § 3731(b)(1) in petitioners' favor. On the one hand, reading § 3731(b)(1) to exclude retaliation actions will generally start the limitations period running when the cause of action accrues. If § 3731(b)(1) excludes retaliation actions, then no express time limit applies to § 3730(h) actions, and we borrow the most closely analogous state time limit absent an expressly applicable one. See <i>supra,</i> at 414-415. The likely analogous state statutes of limitations virtually all start to run when the cause of action accrues  in retaliation actions, when the retaliatory action occurs.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*420</span> The interpretation favored by Wilson and the Government, on the other hand, is in tension with this rule of construction. Under their reading, the statute of limitations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*421</span> for FCA retaliation actions begins to run, at best, on the date the actual or suspected FCA violation occurred. Because that date will precede the retaliatory conduct, their reading starts the time limit running before the retaliation action accrues. Even more oddly, their reading allows a retaliation action to be time barred before it ever accrues  for example, if the employer discovers more than six years after the suspected violation of § 3729 that an employee aided in investigating that fraud, then retaliates. As we have discussed, § 3731(b)(1)'s text permits a construction that avoids these counterintuitive results  that \"civil action under section 3730\" means only those civil actions under § 3730 that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*422</span> have as an element a \"violation of section 3729,\" that is, §§ 3730(a) and (b) actions.</p>\n<p>Granted, other textual evidence cuts against this reading of § 3731(b)(1). In particular, Congress used the phrase \"brought under subsection (a) or (b) of section 3730\" in § 3731(d); this, it is argued, shows that Congress could have been similarly precise in § 3731(b)(1) if it wished. In the context of this statute, however, that argument proves too much, since the same could be said of § 3731(c), which all agree uses the phrase \"action under section 3730\" in more limited, and less precise, fashion. See <i>supra,</i> at 417-418. We do not doubt that Congress could have drafted § 3731(b)(1) with more precision than it did, but the presence of the same inexact wording in § 3731(c) means that the more precise language in § 3731(d) casts little doubt on our reading of the statute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons we have discussed, the FCA's express limitations period does not apply to § 3730(h) actions. The most closely analogous state statute of limitations therefore applies. Judge Wilkinson, in his dissenting opinion below, concluded that the most closely analogous state statute of limitations in this case is North Carolina's 3-year statute of limitations governing wrongful-discharge claims. See 367 F. 3d, at 261-262. The appropriate state statute of limitations to borrow, however, is not within the scope of the question we granted certiorari to decide, and the Court of Appeals did not pass on the point. We therefore leave that issue for remand. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in <i>Dodd</i> v. <i>United States, ante,</i> p. 360, I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*423</span> JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>As the Court points out, it is unusual to find a statute of limitations keyed not to the time of the plaintiff's injury, but to other related events. Still, I believe that Congress has written such a statute here, and we should respect its decision.</p>\n<p>The language of the statute, 31 U. S. C. § 3731(b)(1), is reasonably clear. It says that \"[a] civil action <i>under section 3730</i> may not be brought . . . more than 6 years after the date on which the violation\" of federal false claims law \"is committed.\" (Emphasis added.) Section 3730 lists three kinds of civil actions, including a retaliation action under § 3730(h). Thus, a retaliation action is a \"civil action under section 3730,\" and § 3731(b)(1)'s 6-year limitations period applies.</p>\n<p>The Court tries to overcome the force of this syllogism with the help of two textual arguments. First, it points to the subsection that follows § 3731(b)  § 3731(c)  which says that \"`[i]n any action brought under section 3730, the United States shall be required to prove all essential elements of the cause of action, including damages, by a preponderance of the evidence.'\" See <i>ante,</i> at 418. The Court then reasons that, read in context, the phrase \"action brought under section 3730\" could not refer to <i>all</i> the civil actions listed under § 3730, for the United States is not ordinarily a party to private retaliation suits brought under § 3730(h). <i>Ibid.</i> Rather, the phrase \"action brought under section 3730\" must refer only to the false claims actions listed in §§ 3730(a) and (b). <i>Ibid.</i> Thus, according to the Court, if in § 3731(c), the phrase \"action brought under section 3730\" refers only to a <i>subset</i> of the actions listed under § 3730, one can read the similar phrase in § 3731(b)(1) to contain a similar limitation. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The problem with this argument lies in its conclusion. The reason that § 3731(c) may apply only to §§ 3730(a) and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*424</span> (b) actions has nothing to do with the phrase \"action brought under section 3730.\" Rather, any limitation on § 3731(c)'s application comes from different words, namely, \"the United States.\" These latter words make clear not that the phrase \"under section 3730\" has a different <i>meaning</i> than in (b), but that (c) comes into play only in cases in which the United States is a party (and <i>only</i> in such cases, cf. <i>ibid.</i>). Because it is these words  the subject of the subsection, \"the United States\"  that determines whether (c) has application in any given case, there is nothing in § 3731(c) that would make it \"reasonable,\" <i>ibid.,</i> to read the phrase \"action under section 3730\" <i>in section 3731(b)(1)</i> to apply, as the Court concludes, to only \"two out of three actions under section 3730.\"</p>\n<p>The subsections surrounding §§ 3731(b) and (c) further undermine the Court's extra-textual limitation on \"[a] civil action under section 3730.\" In § 3731(a), Congress apparently used the phrase \"under section 3730\" to mean all three § 3730 actions. § 3731(a) (a \"subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a trial or hearing conducted under section 3730 of this title may be served at any place in the United States\"). And in § 3731(d), Congress used the very words that the Court seeks to find in § 3731(b), but that do not there exist  namely, the words \"under subsection (a) or (b) of section 3730\"  when it meant to narrow a provision's compass to two out of the three § 3730 causes of action. § 3731(d) (\"[A] final judgment rendered in favor of the United States in any criminal proceeding charging fraud or false statements . . . shall estop the defendant from denying the essential elements of the offense in any action which involves the same transaction as in the criminal proceeding and which is brought under subsection (a) or (b) of section 3730\"); see also <i>ante,</i> at 421-422. The statutory context therefore shows that Congress did not intend for the phrase \"[a] civil action under section 3730\" to mean anything other than what it says.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*425</span> Second, the Court points to language in § 3731(b)(1) that specifies <i>when</i> the limitations period begins to run: \"the date on which the violation\" of the false claims provision, § 3729, \"is committed.\" See <i>ante,</i> at 415-416. It then points out that a retaliation action does not necessarily involve an <i>actual</i> false claims violation, because (it assumes) a retaliation plaintiff need only show \"a <i>suspected</i> violation.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 417 (emphasis in original). Thus, adopting relator's and the Government's reading, the Court reasons, would require reading some words into § 3731(b)(1)  so that it would say \"`the [suspected or actual] violation'\"  which would distort the statute more than reading some other, different words into the statute  so that it would say \"[a] civil action under section 3730[(a) or (b)].\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The difficulty with the Court's choice of the latter linguistic addition is that the two sets of textual insertions  on the one hand \"suspected or actual,\" on the other hand \"(a) or (b)\"  are not equivalent. Statutes of limitations, when referring to starting points, generally refer not to <i>actual</i> events, but to <i>alleged</i> events. Thus, a plaintiff's tort action is timely if he files it within, say, three years of the <i>alleged</i> negligently caused injury; a plaintiff's breach-of-contract action is timely if filed within, say, one year of the <i>alleged</i> breach. And a plaintiff who loses such an action because the defendant shows, say, that there was no such injury or no such breach, has not, for that reason, brought the action outside the limitations period. Rather, the suit is still timely even though the violation remains nothing more than \"alleged\" after trial. Such a plaintiff has simply lost a timely filed action on the merits.</p>\n<p>The provision before us is no different. Section 3731(b)(1)'s 6-year time clock begins to run on \"the date on which the violation\" of federal false claims law, § 3729, \"is committed.\" Thus, any § 3730 plaintiff  even one bringing a false claims action under § 3730(a) or § 3730(b)  has six <span class=\"star-pagination\">*426</span> years from the moment of a suspected  that is, an unproven  violation of the False Claims Act's antifraud provision. Thus, as naturally interpreted, the words \"the date on which the violation . . . is committed\" refer to the date on which the suspected violation occurs.</p>\n<p>I recognize that there is a relevant distinction in this case. In the typical case (say, the tort or contract case) the plaintiff must ultimately prove all the relevant allegations. Here, the retaliation victim need not prove that her employer did in fact violate federal false claims law, but only that she believed that there was such a violation. See <i>ibid.</i> But that distinction does not make the difference. Given the clear link between claimed violations of federal false claims law and retaliation actions (the latter depend on the former) and given that triggering events in statutes of limitations implicitly mean <i>alleged</i> triggering events, § 3731(b)(1) remains most naturally read as implicitly referring to alleged or suspected violations of federal false claims law. And at the very least, reading the statute in this way, especially in light of the other statutory indicators, see <i>supra,</i> at 423-424, does far less violence to § 3731(b)(1)'s text than does the Court's addition of \"(a) or (b).\"</p>\n<p>The Court's far stronger argument is not textual. It concerns the limitations provision's purpose. That purpose, after all, includes providing victims of retaliation a reasonable time within which they can file an action to vindicate their rights. Cf. S. Rep. No. 99-345, p. 34 (1986) (addition of a retaliation cause of action intended \"to halt companies . . . from using the threat of economic retaliation to silence `whistle-blowers'\" and to \"assure those who may be considering exposing fraud that they are legally protected from retaliatory acts\"). How can we reconcile that purpose with a reading of the statute that, as a matter of logic, could allow the limitations period to begin to run, perhaps even to terminate, before the forbidden retaliation occurs? See <i>ante,</i> at 421.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*427</span> The answer, in my view, is that Congress could have had a particular <i>qui tam</i>-related purpose in mind. That is, it could have intended to provide a fairly lengthy limitations period, namely, six years from the time the false claims conduct occurs, applicable to <i>all</i> related actions, and then to put an end to all such litigation. This makes particular sense given the reasonable assumption that false claims and retaliation actions are likely to be litigated together. <i>See, e. g.,</i> App. 11-35 (relator's complaint pursuing both <i>qui tam</i> and retaliation claims in same suit); <i>United States ex rel. Lujan</i> v. <i>Hughes Aircraft Co.,</i> 162 F. 3d 1027, 1030 (CA9 1998) (same).</p>\n<p>Of course, as the Court emphasizes, such an unusual provision exacts a price, namely, possible injury to an individual who suffers retaliation that comes late in the day. But apparently there is no such individual. Neither the Court nor petitioners have been able to find any actual example. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Tr. of Oral Arg. 5, 6; see also Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 27-28 (United States is unaware of any such example). Nor have I.</p>\n<p>By contrast, the Court's reading of the statute exacts a different, but certain, price. It substitutes for a fairly lengthy  and <i>uniform</i>  6-year limitations term, a crazy quilt of limitations periods stitched together from the laws of 51 jurisdictions which, in some instances, might require a plaintiff to bring a retaliation claim within 90 days, six months, or one year after the retaliation takes place. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 61.103(2) (Lexis 2004) (90-day limitations period for certain whistle-blower actions); Fla. Stat. Ann. § 112.3187(8)(a) (2003) (180-day limitations period); <i>Hughes Aircraft Co., supra,</i> at 1035 (California's 1-year limitations period for wrongful termination in violation of public policy applies to § 3730(h) action). Rather than shed crocodile tears for the imagined plight of a nonexistent whistle-blower as petitioners ask us to do, I would read the statute to do what the statute says Congress wanted: to provide a relatively <span class=\"star-pagination\">*428</span> long, single, uniform limitations period that, in practice, seems to protect the many real potential plaintiffs, such as relator, who will otherwise find themselves shut out of court. Such a reading also avoids the attendant practical difficulties and uncertainties inherent in requiring federal courts to borrow state statutes of limitations. See <i>Jones</i> v. <i>R. R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co.,</i> 541 U. S. 369, 377-380, and n. 13 (2004) (discussing problems with this practice).</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for the Equal Employment Advisory Council et al. by <i>Ann Elizabeth Reesman, Stephen A.

He argues that § 3731(b)(1) does not govern § 3730(h) actions because \"it is so unlikely that a legislature would actually intend\" to start the statute of limitations running before the cause of action accrues that he \"would presume that the anomaly was the product of a drafting error\" regardless of whether the text is ambiguous. <i>Dodd</i> v. <i>United States, ante,</i> at 362, n. 1 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). This is not the proper analysis. Section 3731(b)(1) is ambiguous because its text, literally read, admits of two plausible interpretations. <i>Supra,</i> at 415-417. We apply the rule that Congress generally drafts statutes of limitations to begin when the cause of action accrues to resolve that ambiguity, not to create it in the first instance.</p>\n<p>[3]  Ala.

Letter.</i><sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p>JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.<sup>[]</sup></p>\n<p>This case presents the question whether the 6-year statute of limitations in the False Claims Act (FCA or Act), see 31 U. S. C. § 3731(b)(1), governs FCA civil actions for retaliation, see § 3730(h). We hold that it does not and therefore conclude that the most closely analogous state limitations period applies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The FCA prohibits any person from making false or fraudulent claims for payment to the United States. § 3729(a). Persons who do so are liable for civil penalties of up to $10,000 per claim and treble damages. <i>Ibid.</i> The Act sets forth two principal enforcement mechanisms for policing this proscription. First, the Attorney General may sue to remedy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*412</span> violations of § 3729. § 3730(a). Second, private individuals may bring <i>qui tam</i> actions in the Government's name for § 3729 violations. § 3730(b)(1); see <i>Vermont Agency of Natural Resources</i> v. <i>United States ex rel. Stevens,</i> 529 U. S. 765, 769-772 (2000). The <i>qui tam</i> relator must give the Government notice of the action, and the Government is entitled to intervene in the suit. § 3730(b)(2). The relator receives up to 30 percent of the proceeds of the action, in addition to attorney's fees and costs. §§ 3730(d)(1), (2).</p>\n<p>The 1986 amendments to the FCA created a third enforcement mechanism: a private cause of action for an individual retaliated against by his employer for assisting an FCA investigation or proceeding. § 3730(h). Section 3730(h) provides in relevant part that</p>\n<blockquote>\"[a]ny employee who is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment by his or her employer because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the employee or others in furtherance of an action under this section, including investigation for, initiation of, testimony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this section, shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee whole.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Remedies for retaliation include reinstatement, two times the amount of back-pay plus interest, special damages, litigation costs, and attorney's fees. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The 1986 amendments also revised the language of the 6-year statute of limitations applicable to FCA actions. The previous version of the statute provided that \"[a] civil action under section 3730 of this title must be brought within 6 years from the date the violation is committed.\" § 3731(b) (1982 ed.). The 1986 amendments revised this provision to read:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*413</span> \"(b) A civil action under section 3730 may not be brought </blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) more than 6 years after the date on which the violation of section 3729 is committed, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) more than 3 years after the date when facts material to the right of action are known or reasonably should have been known by the official of the United States charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances, but in no event more than 10 years after the date on which the violation is committed . . . .\" § 3731 (2000 ed.).</blockquote>\n<p>In January 2001, relator Karen T. Wilson brought an FCA <i>qui tam</i> and retaliation action against petitioners. Petitioners Graham County Soil and Water Conservation District and Cherokee County Soil and Water Conservation District are special-purpose local government entities; the other petitioners are various local and federal officials. Graham County District employed Wilson as a secretary. Wilson alleged that petitioners made numerous false claims for payment to the United States in connection with a federal disaster relief program, the Emergency Watershed Protection Program, App. 17-20, and in connection with agricultural programs administered by North Carolina but funded by the Federal Government, <i>id.,</i> at 17-24.</p>\n<p>Wilson contended, in addition, that Graham County District officials retaliated against her for aiding federal officials in their investigation of these false claims. <i>Id.,</i> at 25-30. Wilson alerted federal officials to petitioners' suspected fraudulent activities in December 1995 and cooperated with the ensuing investigation. <i>Id.,</i> at 26-27. Because of her cooperation, the complaint alleged, Graham County District officials repeatedly harassed her from 1996 to 1997, eventually inducing her to resign in March 1997. <i>Id.,</i> at 28-30.</p>\n<p>Petitioners successfully moved to dismiss Wilson's retaliation action as untimely. They argued that the 6-year limitations period provided in § 3731(b)(1) did not apply to Wilson's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*414</span> retaliation action. Absent an applicable federal limitations period, they asked the District Court to borrow North Carolina's 3-year statute of limitations for retaliatory-discharge actions. The District Court agreed and dismissed the retaliation claim, since Wilson filed it more than three years after her March 1997 discharge. App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a-70a. The court certified that ruling for interlocutory appeal. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2490130\"><a href=\"/opinion/2490130/united-states-ex-rel-wilson-v-graham-county-soil-w/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1042</span></a></span>, 1050-1051 (WDNC 2002).</p>\n<p>On interlocutory appeal, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed. In the majority's view, the plain language of § 3731(b)(1) supplies a limitations period for retaliation actions, making it unnecessary to borrow one from North Carolina law. The court reasoned that § 3731(b)(1) governs § 3730(h) retaliation actions, because it applies its 6-year limitations period to \"`[a] civil action under section 3730.\" 367 F. 3d 245, 251 (2004) (brackets in original).</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari to resolve a disagreement among the Courts of Appeals regarding whether § 3731(b)(1)'s 6-year statute of limitations applies to § 3730(h) retaliation actions or whether, instead, the most closely analogous state limitations period governs. 543 U. S. 1042 (2005). Compare <i>Neal</i> v. <i>Honeywell Inc.,</i> 33 F. 3d 860, 865-866 (CA7 1994) (holding that FCA 6-year period applies), with <i>United States ex rel. Lujan</i> v. <i>Hughes Aircraft Co.,</i> 162 F. 3d 1027, 1034-1035 (CA9 1998) (holding that most closely analogous state limitations period governs).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>To determine the applicable statute of limitations for a cause of action created by a federal statute, we first ask whether the statute expressly supplies a limitations period. If it does not, we generally \"borrow\" the most closely analogous state limitations period. See <i>North Star Steel Co.</i> v. <i>Thomas,</i> 515 U. S. 29, 33-34 (1995); <i>Reed</i> v. <i>Transportation Union,</i> 488 U. S. 319, 324 (1989); <i>Agency Holding Corp.</i> v. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*415</span> <i>Malley-Duff &amp; Associates, Inc.,</i> 483 U. S. 143, 157-165 (1987) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (tracing history of borrowing state limitations periods). In the rare case, we have even borrowed analogous federal limitations periods in the absence of an expressly applicable one, see, <i>e. g., id.,</i> at 150-157, but no party points to a reason why we should do so here, and we can think of none. The only arguably applicable express statute of limitations is the 6-year limit set forth in § 3731(b)(1). The question, then, is whether § 3731(b)(1) applies by its terms to retaliation actions under § 3730(h); if it does not, our cases dictate that the most closely analogous state limitations period applies.</p>\n<p>Under § 3731(b)(1), \"[a] civil action under section 3730 may not be brought ... more than 6 years after the date on which the violation of section 3729 is committed.\" Following the Court of Appeals' lead and supported by the United States appearing as <i>amicus curiae,</i> Wilson argues that this language unambiguously applies to FCA retaliation actions. She points out that § 3731(b)(1) applies a 6-year limitations period to \"a civil action under section 3730,\" and that § 3730(h) actions arise under § 3730; hence, she claims, the 6-year period governs § 3730(h) actions. See <i>Neal, supra,</i> at 865-866 (arguing same). We think the statute is more complex than this argument supposes. Statutory language has meaning only in context, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Leocal</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 543 U. S. 1, 9 (2004), and § 3731(b)(1), read in its proper context, does not govern § 3730(h) actions for retaliation.</p>\n<p>Section 3731(b)(1) is ambiguous, rather than clear, about whether a § 3730(h) retaliation action is \"a civil action under section 3730.\" Another reasonable reading is that it applies only to actions arising under §§ 3730(a) and (b), not to § 3730(h) retaliation actions. That reading is suggested by the language in § 3731(b)(1) tying the start of the time limit to \"the date on which the violation of section 3729 is committed.\" In other words, the time limit begins to run on the date the defendant submitted a false claim for payment. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*416</span> See <i>supra,</i> at 412-413. This language casts doubt on whether § 3731(b)(1) specifies a limitations period for retaliation actions. For even a well-pleaded retaliation complaint need not allege that the defendant submitted a false claim, leaving the limitations period without a starting point if § 3731(b)(1) is applicable. A retaliation plaintiff, instead, need prove only that the defendant retaliated against him for engaging in \"lawful acts done . . . in furtherance of\" an FCA \"action filed or to be filed,\" § 3730(h), language that protects an employee's conduct even if the target of an investigation or action to be filed was innocent.<sup>[1]</sup> Applying § 3731(b)(1) to FCA retaliation actions, then, sits uneasily with § 3731(b)(1)'s language, which assumes that well-pleaded \"action[s] under section 3730\" to which it is applicable include a \"violation of section 3729\" certain from which to start the time running. Section 3731(b)(1), by contrast, naturally applies to well-pleaded §§ 3730(a) and (b) actions. They require the plaintiff to plead that the defendant submitted a false claim for payment, and therefore necessarily specify when § 3731(b)(1)'s time limit begins. This textual anomaly, at a minimum, shows that § 3731(b)(1) is ambiguous about whether \"action under section 3730\" means all actions under § 3730, or only §§ 3730(a) and (b) actions.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*417</span> Wilson and the United States dispute that the statute contains this anomaly, and instead urge that it clearly applies by its terms to all § 3730 actions. They point out that every § 3730(h) action requires the plaintiff to prove that he engaged in protected conduct related to at least a <i>suspected</i> violation of § 3729, and argue that § 3731(b)(1)'s limitations period simply begins to run on the date of the suspected violation. Assuming, without deciding, that § 3730(h) retaliation actions have as an element a suspected violation of § 3729, their interpretation indeed removes the anomaly, but only at the cost of reading into the statute the word \"suspected\" before the phrase \"violation of section 3729.\" Section 3731(b)(1) speaks of \"violation[s] of section 3729\"  <i>actual,</i> not <i>suspected,</i> ones. Wilson and the United States answer that this argument proves too much, because even §§ 3730(a) and (b) actions involve only \"suspected\" violations of § 3729 at the pleading stage of litigation; but this response misses the point. Every § 3730(a) or (b) plaintiff who states or proves a valid claim for relief must allege or prove an actual violation of § 3729; retaliation plaintiffs need only allege or prove a suspected violation of § 3729 (or so we are willing to assume). The point is that § 3731(b)(1)'s language applies naturally to all successfully pleaded or proved retaliation actions only if one reads \"suspected\" into its terms, as the dissent essentially concedes. See <i>post,</i> at 425-426 (opinion of BREYER, J.).</p>\n<p>Section 3731(b)(1)'s literal text, then, is ambiguous. Wilson and the Government ask us to read it as if it said \"the [suspected or actual] violation of section 3729.\" Petitioners ask us to read § 3731(b) as if it said \"civil action under section 3730[(a) or (b)].\"</p>\n<p>Two considerations convince us that the better way to resolve this ambiguity is to read the 6-year period to govern only §§ 3730(a) and (b) actions, and not § 3730(h) retaliation actions. First, the very next subsection of the statute, § 3731(c), also uses the similarly unqualified phrase \"action <span class=\"star-pagination\">*418</span> brought under section 3730\" to refer only to §§ 3730(a) and (b) actions. Section 3731(c) provides that \"[i]n any action brought under section 3730, the United States shall be required to prove all essential elements of the cause of action, including damages, by a preponderance of the evidence.\" As Wilson and the United States concede, the context of this provision implies that the phrase \"any action brought under section 3730\" is limited to § 3730(a) actions brought by the United States and § 3730(b) actions in which the United States intervenes as a party, as those are the types of § 3730 actions in which the United States necessarily participates. Otherwise, the United States would be \"required to prove all essential elements of the cause of action,\" § 3731(c), in all § 3730 actions, regardless of whether it participated in the action (a consequence the dissent implicitly embraces by claiming that \"any action brought under section 3730\" in § 3731(c) means all § 3730 actions, see <i>post,</i> at 423-424 (opinion of BREYER, J.)). This implicit limitation of the phrase \"action under section 3730\" shows that Congress used the term \"action under section 3730\" imprecisely in § 3731 and, in particular, that Congress sometimes used the term to refer only to a subset of § 3730 actions. It is reasonable to read the same language in § 3731(b)(1) to be likewise limited.</p>\n<p>Second, reading § 3731(b)(1) to apply only to §§ 3730(a) and (b) actions is in keeping with the default rule that Congress generally drafts statutes of limitations to begin when the cause of action accrues. We have repeatedly recognized that Congress legislates against the \"standard rule that the limitations period commences when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.\" <i>Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund</i> v. <i>Ferbar Corp. of Cal.,</i> 522 U. S. 192, 201 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 544 U. S. 295, 305 (2005) (calling it \"highly doubtful\" that Congress intended a time limit on pursuing a claim to expire before the claim arose); <i>Reiter</i> v. <i>Cooper,</i> 507 U. S. 258, 267 (1993) (declining to countenance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*419</span> the \"odd result\" that a federal cause of action and statute of limitations arise at different times \"absen[t] . . . any such indication in the statute\"); <i>TRW Inc.</i> v. <i>Andrews,</i> 534 U. S. 19, 37 (2001) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (\"Absent other indication, a statute of limitations begins to run at the time the plaintiff has the right to apply to the court for relief\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Therefore, where, as the case is here, there are two plausible constructions of a statute of limitations, we should adopt the construction that starts the time limit running when the cause of action (here retaliation) accrues.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>This approach resolves the ambiguity in § 3731(b)(1) in petitioners' favor. On the one hand, reading § 3731(b)(1) to exclude retaliation actions will generally start the limitations period running when the cause of action accrues. If § 3731(b)(1) excludes retaliation actions, then no express time limit applies to § 3730(h) actions, and we borrow the most closely analogous state time limit absent an expressly applicable one. See <i>supra,</i> at 414-415. The likely analogous state statutes of limitations virtually all start to run when the cause of action accrues  in retaliation actions, when the retaliatory action occurs.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*420</span> The interpretation favored by Wilson and the Government, on the other hand, is in tension with this rule of construction. Under their reading, the statute of limitations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*421</span> for FCA retaliation actions begins to run, at best, on the date the actual or suspected FCA violation occurred. Because that date will precede the retaliatory conduct, their reading starts the time limit running before the retaliation action accrues. Even more oddly, their reading allows a retaliation action to be time barred before it ever accrues  for example, if the employer discovers more than six years after the suspected violation of § 3729 that an employee aided in investigating that fraud, then retaliates. As we have discussed, § 3731(b)(1)'s text permits a construction that avoids these counterintuitive results  that \"civil action under section 3730\" means only those civil actions under § 3730 that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*422</span> have as an element a \"violation of section 3729,\" that is, §§ 3730(a) and (b) actions.</p>\n<p>Granted, other textual evidence cuts against this reading of § 3731(b)(1). In particular, Congress used the phrase \"brought under subsection (a) or (b) of section 3730\" in § 3731(d); this, it is argued, shows that Congress could have been similarly precise in § 3731(b)(1) if it wished. In the context of this statute, however, that argument proves too much, since the same could be said of § 3731(c), which all agree uses the phrase \"action under section 3730\" in more limited, and less precise, fashion. See <i>supra,</i> at 417-418. We do not doubt that Congress could have drafted § 3731(b)(1) with more precision than it did, but the presence of the same inexact wording in § 3731(c) means that the more precise language in § 3731(d) casts little doubt on our reading of the statute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons we have discussed, the FCA's express limitations period does not apply to § 3730(h) actions. The most closely analogous state statute of limitations therefore applies. Judge Wilkinson, in his dissenting opinion below, concluded that the most closely analogous state statute of limitations in this case is North Carolina's 3-year statute of limitations governing wrongful-discharge claims. See 367 F. 3d, at 261-262. The appropriate state statute of limitations to borrow, however, is not within the scope of the question we granted certiorari to decide, and the Court of Appeals did not pass on the point. We therefore leave that issue for remand. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in <i>Dodd</i> v. <i>United States, ante,</i> p. 360, I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*423</span> JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>As the Court points out, it is unusual to find a statute of limitations keyed not to the time of the plaintiff's injury, but to other related events. Still, I believe that Congress has written such a statute here, and we should respect its decision.</p>\n<p>The language of the statute, 31 U. S. C. § 3731(b)(1), is reasonably clear. It says that \"[a] civil action <i>under section 3730</i> may not be brought . . . more than 6 years after the date on which the violation\" of federal false claims law \"is committed.\" (Emphasis added.) Section 3730 lists three kinds of civil actions, including a retaliation action under § 3730(h). Thus, a retaliation action is a \"civil action under section 3730,\" and § 3731(b)(1)'s 6-year limitations period applies.</p>\n<p>The Court tries to overcome the force of this syllogism with the help of two textual arguments. First, it points to the subsection that follows § 3731(b)  § 3731(c)  which says that \"`[i]n any action brought under section 3730, the United States shall be required to prove all essential elements of the cause of action, including damages, by a preponderance of the evidence.'\" See <i>ante,</i> at 418. The Court then reasons that, read in context, the phrase \"action brought under section 3730\" could not refer to <i>all</i> the civil actions listed under § 3730, for the United States is not ordinarily a party to private retaliation suits brought under § 3730(h). <i>Ibid.</i> Rather, the phrase \"action brought under section 3730\" must refer only to the false claims actions listed in §§ 3730(a) and (b). <i>Ibid.</i> Thus, according to the Court, if in § 3731(c), the phrase \"action brought under section 3730\" refers only to a <i>subset</i> of the actions listed under § 3730, one can read the similar phrase in § 3731(b)(1) to contain a similar limitation. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The problem with this argument lies in its conclusion. The reason that § 3731(c) may apply only to §§ 3730(a) and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*424</span> (b) actions has nothing to do with the phrase \"action brought under section 3730.\" Rather, any limitation on § 3731(c)'s application comes from different words, namely, \"the United States.\" These latter words make clear not that the phrase \"under section 3730\" has a different <i>meaning</i> than in (b), but that (c) comes into play only in cases in which the United States is a party (and <i>only</i> in such cases, cf. <i>ibid.</i>). Because it is these words  the subject of the subsection, \"the United States\"  that determines whether (c) has application in any given case, there is nothing in § 3731(c) that would make it \"reasonable,\" <i>ibid.,</i> to read the phrase \"action under section 3730\" <i>in section 3731(b)(1)</i> to apply, as the Court concludes, to only \"two out of three actions under section 3730.\"</p>\n<p>The subsections surrounding §§ 3731(b) and (c) further undermine the Court's extra-textual limitation on \"[a] civil action under section 3730.\" In § 3731(a), Congress apparently used the phrase \"under section 3730\" to mean all three § 3730 actions. § 3731(a) (a \"subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a trial or hearing conducted under section 3730 of this title may be served at any place in the United States\"). And in § 3731(d), Congress used the very words that the Court seeks to find in § 3731(b), but that do not there exist  namely, the words \"under subsection (a) or (b) of section 3730\"  when it meant to narrow a provision's compass to two out of the three § 3730 causes of action. § 3731(d) (\"[A] final judgment rendered in favor of the United States in any criminal proceeding charging fraud or false statements . . . shall estop the defendant from denying the essential elements of the offense in any action which involves the same transaction as in the criminal proceeding and which is brought under subsection (a) or (b) of section 3730\"); see also <i>ante,</i> at 421-422. The statutory context therefore shows that Congress did not intend for the phrase \"[a] civil action under section 3730\" to mean anything other than what it says.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*425</span> Second, the Court points to language in § 3731(b)(1) that specifies <i>when</i> the limitations period begins to run: \"the date on which the violation\" of the false claims provision, § 3729, \"is committed.\" See <i>ante,</i> at 415-416. It then points out that a retaliation action does not necessarily involve an <i>actual</i> false claims violation, because (it assumes) a retaliation plaintiff need only show \"a <i>suspected</i> violation.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 417 (emphasis in original). Thus, adopting relator's and the Government's reading, the Court reasons, would require reading some words into § 3731(b)(1)  so that it would say \"`the [suspected or actual] violation'\"  which would distort the statute more than reading some other, different words into the statute  so that it would say \"[a] civil action under section 3730[(a) or (b)].\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The difficulty with the Court's choice of the latter linguistic addition is that the two sets of textual insertions  on the one hand \"suspected or actual,\" on the other hand \"(a) or (b)\"  are not equivalent. Statutes of limitations, when referring to starting points, generally refer not to <i>actual</i> events, but to <i>alleged</i> events. Thus, a plaintiff's tort action is timely if he files it within, say, three years of the <i>alleged</i> negligently caused injury; a plaintiff's breach-of-contract action is timely if filed within, say, one year of the <i>alleged</i> breach. And a plaintiff who loses such an action because the defendant shows, say, that there was no such injury or no such breach, has not, for that reason, brought the action outside the limitations period. Rather, the suit is still timely even though the violation remains nothing more than \"alleged\" after trial. Such a plaintiff has simply lost a timely filed action on the merits.</p>\n<p>The provision before us is no different. Section 3731(b)(1)'s 6-year time clock begins to run on \"the date on which the violation\" of federal false claims law, § 3729, \"is committed.\" Thus, any § 3730 plaintiff  even one bringing a false claims action under § 3730(a) or § 3730(b)  has six <span class=\"star-pagination\">*426</span> years from the moment of a suspected  that is, an unproven  violation of the False Claims Act's antifraud provision. Thus, as naturally interpreted, the words \"the date on which the violation . . . is committed\" refer to the date on which the suspected violation occurs.</p>\n<p>I recognize that there is a relevant distinction in this case. In the typical case (say, the tort or contract case) the plaintiff must ultimately prove all the relevant allegations. Here, the retaliation victim need not prove that her employer did in fact violate federal false claims law, but only that she believed that there was such a violation. See <i>ibid.</i> But that distinction does not make the difference. Given the clear link between claimed violations of federal false claims law and retaliation actions (the latter depend on the former) and given that triggering events in statutes of limitations implicitly mean <i>alleged</i> triggering events, § 3731(b)(1) remains most naturally read as implicitly referring to alleged or suspected violations of federal false claims law. And at the very least, reading the statute in this way, especially in light of the other statutory indicators, see <i>supra,</i> at 423-424, does far less violence to § 3731(b)(1)'s text than does the Court's addition of \"(a) or (b).\"</p>\n<p>The Court's far stronger argument is not textual. It concerns the limitations provision's purpose. That purpose, after all, includes providing victims of retaliation a reasonable time within which they can file an action to vindicate their rights. Cf. S. Rep. No. 99-345, p. 34 (1986) (addition of a retaliation cause of action intended \"to halt companies . . . from using the threat of economic retaliation to silence `whistle-blowers'\" and to \"assure those who may be considering exposing fraud that they are legally protected from retaliatory acts\"). How can we reconcile that purpose with a reading of the statute that, as a matter of logic, could allow the limitations period to begin to run, perhaps even to terminate, before the forbidden retaliation occurs? See <i>ante,</i> at 421.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*427</span> The answer, in my view, is that Congress could have had a particular <i>qui tam</i>-related purpose in mind. That is, it could have intended to provide a fairly lengthy limitations period, namely, six years from the time the false claims conduct occurs, applicable to <i>all</i> related actions, and then to put an end to all such litigation. This makes particular sense given the reasonable assumption that false claims and retaliation actions are likely to be litigated together. <i>See, e. g.,</i> App. 11-35 (relator's complaint pursuing both <i>qui tam</i> and retaliation claims in same suit); <i>United States ex rel. Lujan</i> v. <i>Hughes Aircraft Co.,</i> 162 F. 3d 1027, 1030 (CA9 1998) (same).</p>\n<p>Of course, as the Court emphasizes, such an unusual provision exacts a price, namely, possible injury to an individual who suffers retaliation that comes late in the day. But apparently there is no such individual. Neither the Court nor petitioners have been able to find any actual example. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Tr. of Oral Arg. 5, 6; see also Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 27-28 (United States is unaware of any such example). Nor have I.</p>\n<p>By contrast, the Court's reading of the statute exacts a different, but certain, price. It substitutes for a fairly lengthy  and <i>uniform</i>  6-year limitations term, a crazy quilt of limitations periods stitched together from the laws of 51 jurisdictions which, in some instances, might require a plaintiff to bring a retaliation claim within 90 days, six months, or one year after the retaliation takes place. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 61.103(2) (Lexis 2004) (90-day limitations period for certain whistle-blower actions); Fla. Stat. Ann. § 112.3187(8)(a) (2003) (180-day limitations period); <i>Hughes Aircraft Co., supra,</i> at 1035 (California's 1-year limitations period for wrongful termination in violation of public policy applies to § 3730(h) action). Rather than shed crocodile tears for the imagined plight of a nonexistent whistle-blower as petitioners ask us to do, I would read the statute to do what the statute says Congress wanted: to provide a relatively <span class=\"star-pagination\">*428</span> long, single, uniform limitations period that, in practice, seems to protect the many real potential plaintiffs, such as relator, who will otherwise find themselves shut out of court. Such a reading also avoids the attendant practical difficulties and uncertainties inherent in requiring federal courts to borrow state statutes of limitations. See <i>Jones</i> v. <i>R. R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co.,</i> 541 U. S. 369, 377-380, and n. 13 (2004) (discussing problems with this practice).</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for the Equal Employment Advisory Council et al. by <i>Ann Elizabeth Reesman, Stephen A.

This is not the proper analysis. Section 3731(b)(1) is ambiguous because its text, literally read, admits of two plausible interpretations. <i>Supra,</i> at 415-417.

WILSON\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 04–169.      Argued April 20, 2005—Decided June 20, 2005\nThe False Claims Act (FCA) prohibits a person from making false or\n  fraudulent claims for payment to the United States. 31 U. S. C.\n  §3729(a). That prohibition may be enforced in suits filed by the At-\n  torney General, §3730(a), and in qui tam actions brought by private\n  individuals in the Government’s name, §3730(b)(1). A 1986 amend-\n  ment to the FCA created a private cause of action for an individual\n  retaliated against by his employer for assisting an FCA investigation\n  or proceeding, §3730(h), and revised the FCA’s statute of limitations,\n  §3731(b). Section 3731(b) provides that “[a] civil action under section\n  3730 may not be brought . . . more than 6 years after the date on\n  which the violation of section 3729 is committed.” In 2001, respon-\n  dent Wilson brought an FCA qui tam action against petitioners,\n  along with an FCA retaliation claim. Petitioner Graham County Soil\n  and Water Conservation District employed Wilson as a secretary.\n  Wilson alleged that petitioner county officials retaliated against her\n  for alerting federal officials to the purported fraud and for cooperat-\n  ing with the ensuing investigation, ultimately forcing her 1997 resig-\n  nation from the District. Petitioners successfully moved to dismiss\n  the retaliation claim as untimely, on the ground that North Caro-\n  lina’s 3-year statute of limitations governed Wilson’s FCA action and\n  barred it. Reversing, the Fourth Circuit found it unnecessary to bor-\n  row a state limitations period because one was supplied by\n  §3731(b)(1).\nHeld: Section 3731(b)(1)’s limitations period does not govern §3730(h)\n retaliation actions. Instead, the most closely analogous state statute\n of limitations applies. Pp. 4–13.\n    (a) To determine the applicable statute of limitations for a cause of\n2        GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL & WATER CONSERVATION\n            DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON\n                            Syllabus\n\n    action created by federal statute, this Court asks first whether the\n    statute expressly supplies a limitations period. If not, the most\n    closely analogous state limitations period applies. Pp. 4–5.\n       (b) Section 3730(h) is a subsection of §3730, but §3731(b)(1) is\n    nonetheless ambiguous about whether a §3730(h) retaliation action is\n    “a civil action under section 3730” as that phrase is used in\n    §3731(b)(1). Another reasonable reading is that §3731(b)(1)’s limita-\n    tions period applies only to §§3730(a) and (b) actions. Section\n    3731(b)(1) starts the limitations period running on “the date on which\n    the violation of section 3729 is committed,” that is, on the date the\n    false claim was actually submitted. That language casts doubt on\n    whether §3731(b)(1) specifies a limitations period for retaliation ac-\n    tions. For even a well-pleaded retaliation complaint need not allege\n    that the defendant submitted a false claim, leaving the limitations\n    period without a starting point if §3731(b)(1) is applicable. By con-\n    trast, the section naturally applies to well-pleaded §§3370(a) and (b)\n    actions. Those actions require a plaintiff to plead that the defendant\n    submitted a false claim and therefore necessarily specify when\n    §3731(b)(1)’s time limit begins. At a minimum this anomaly shows\n    that §3731(b)(1) is ambiguous about whether “action under section\n    3730” means all actions arising under that section. Pp. 5–7.\n       (c) Two considerations show that the better way to resolve this am-\n    biguity is to read the 6-year period to govern only §§3370(a) and (b)\n    actions. First, the very next subsection, §3730(c), uses the similarly\n    unqualified phrase “action brought under section 3730” to refer only\n    to §§3370(a) and (b) actions. Second, reading §3731(b)(1) to apply\n    only to those actions is in keeping with the default rule that Congress\n    generally drafts statutes of limitations to begin when the plaintiff\n    has a complete and present cause of action. Where, as here, there are\n    two plausible constructions, this Court should adopt the construction\n    that starts the time limit running when the cause of action (here re-\n    taliation) accrues. This approach resolves §3731(b)(1)’s ambiguity in\n    petitioners’ favor. Reading §3731(b)(1) to exclude retaliation actions\n    will generally start the limitations period running when the cause of\n    action accrues, for the likely analogous state statutes virtually all\n    start when the retaliatory action occurs. However, under the reading\n    favored by Wilson and the Government, the limitations period would\n    begin at best on the date an actual or suspected FCA violation oc-\n    curred, which would precede the retaliatory conduct. Pp. 7–12.\n       (d) The Court of Appeals should determine in the first instance the\n    appropriate state statute of limitations to borrow.

WILSON\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStevens, 529 U. S. 765, 769–772 (2000). The qui tam relator\nmust give the Government notice of the action, and the\nGovernment is entitled to intervene in the suit. §3730(b)(2).\nThe relator receives up to 30 percent of the proceeds of the\naction, in addition to attorney’s fees and costs.\n§§3730(d)(1), (2).\n  The 1986 amendments to the FCA created a third en-\nforcement mechanism: a private cause of action for an\nindividual retaliated against by his employer for assisting\nan FCA investigation or proceeding. §3730(h). Section\n3730(h) provides in relevant part that\n    “[a]ny employee who is discharged, demoted, sus-\n    pended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner\n    discriminated against in the terms and conditions of\n    employment by his or her employer because of lawful\n    acts done by the employee on behalf of the employee\n    or others in furtherance of an action under this sec-\n    tion, including investigation for, initiation of, testi-\n    mony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed\n    under this section, shall be entitled to all relief neces-\n    sary to make the employee whole.”\nRemedies for retaliation include reinstatement, two times\nthe amount of backpay plus interest, special damages,\nlitigation costs, and attorney’s fees. Ibid.\n   The 1986 amendments also revised the language of the\n6-year statute of limitations applicable to FCA actions.\nThe previous version of the statute provided that “[a] civil\naction under section 3730 of this title must be brought\nwithin 6 years from the date the violation is committed.”\n§3731(b) (1982 ed.). The 1986 amendments revised this\nprovision to read:\n      “(b) A civil action under section 3730 may not be\n    brought—\n      “(1) more than 6 years after the date on which the\n    violation of section 3729 is committed, or\n                  Cite as: 545 U.

Wilson brought\nan FCA qui tam and retaliation action against petitioners.\nPetitioners Graham County Soil and Water Conservation\nDistrict and Cherokee County Soil and Water Conserva-\ntion District are special-purpose local government entities;\nthe other petitioners are various local and federal officials.\nGraham County District employed Wilson as a secretary.\nWilson alleged that petitioners made numerous false\nclaims for payment to the United States in connection\nwith a federal disaster relief program, the Emergency\nWatershed Protection Program, App. 17–20, and in con-\nnection with agricultural programs administered by North\nCarolina but funded by the Federal Government, id., at\n17–24.\n   Wilson contended, in addition, that Graham County\nDistrict officials retaliated against her for aiding federal\nofficials in their investigation of these false claims. Id., at\n25–30. Wilson alerted federal officials to petitioners’\nsuspected fraudulent activities in December 1995 and\ncooperated with the ensuing investigation. Id., at 26–27.\nBecause of her cooperation, the complaint alleged, Gra-\nham County District officials repeatedly harassed her\nfrom 1996 to 1997, eventually inducing her to resign in\nMarch 1997. Id., at 28–30.\n   Petitioners successfully moved to dismiss Wilson’s re-\ntaliation action as untimely. They argued that the 6-year\nlimitations period provided in §3731(b)(1) did not apply to\nWilson’s retaliation action. Absent an applicable federal\n4     GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL & WATER CONSERVATION\n         DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlimitations period, they asked the District Court to borrow\nNorth Carolina’s 3-year statute of limitations for retalia-\ntory-discharge actions. The District Court agreed and\ndismissed the retaliation claim, since Wilson filed it more\nthan three years after her March 1997 discharge. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 67a–70a. The court certified that ruling for\ninterlocutory appeal. 224 F. Supp. 2d 1042, 1050–1051\n(WDNC 2002).\n   On interlocutory appeal, a divided panel of the Court of\nAppeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed. In the majority’s\nview, the plain language of §3731(b)(1) supplies a limita-\ntions period for retaliation actions, making it unnecessary\nto borrow one from North Carolina law. The court rea-\nsoned that §3731(b)(1) governs §3730(h) retaliation ac-\ntions, because it applies its 6-year limitations period to\n“[a] civil action under section 3730.” 367 F. 3d 245, 251\n(2004) (brackets in original).\n   We granted certiorari to resolve a disagreement among\nthe Courts of Appeals regarding whether §3731(b)(1)’s 6-\nyear statute of limitations applies to §3730(h) retaliation\nactions or whether, instead, the most closely analogous\nstate limitations period governs. 543 U. S. ___ (2005).\nCompare Neal v. Honeywell Inc., 33 F. 3d 860, 865–866\n(CA7 1994) (holding that FCA 6-year period applies), with\nUnited States ex rel. Lujan v. Hughes Aircraft Co., 162\nF. 3d 1027, 1034–1035 (CA9 1998) (holding that most\nclosely analogous state limitations period governs).\n                              II\n  To determine the applicable statute of limitations for a\ncause of action created by a federal statute, we first ask\nwhether the statute expressly supplies a limitations pe-\nriod. If it does not, we generally “borrow” the most closely\nanalogous state limitations period. See North Star Steel\nCo. v. Thomas, 515 U. S. 29, 33–34 (1995); Reed v. Transpor-\ntation Union, 488 U. S. 319, 324 (1989); Agency Holding\n                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCorp. v. Malley-Duff & Associates, Inc., 483 U. S. 143, 157–\n165 (1987) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (tracing\nhistory of borrowing state limitations periods). In the rare\ncase, we have even borrowed analogous federal limitations\nperiods in the absence of an expressly applicable one, see,\ne.g., id., at 150–157, but no party points to a reason why we\nshould do so here, and we can think of none. The only\narguably applicable express statute of limitations is the 6-\nyear limit set forth in §3731(b)(1). The question, then, is\nwhether §3731(b)(1) applies by its terms to retaliation ac-\ntions under §3730(h); if it does not, our cases dictate that\nthe most closely analogous state limitations period applies.\n   Under §3731(b)(1), “[a] civil action under section 3730\nmay not be brought . . . more than 6 years after the date\non which the violation of section 3729 is committed.”\nFollowing the Court of Appeals’ lead and supported by the\nUnited States appearing as amicus curiae, Wilson argues\nthat this language unambiguously applies to FCA retalia-\ntion actions. She points out that §3731(b)(1) applies a 6-\nyear limitations period to “a civil action under section\n3730,” and that §3730(h) actions arise under §3730; hence,\nthey claim, the 6-year period governs §3730(h) actions.\nSee Neal, supra, at 865–866 (arguing same). We think the\nstatute is more complex than this argument supposes.\nStatutory language has meaning only in context, see, e.g.,\nLeocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. ___, ___ (2004) (slip op., at 7),\nand §3731(b)(1), read in its proper context, does not govern\n§3730(h) actions for retaliation.\n   Section 3731(b)(1) is ambiguous, rather than clear,\nabout whether a §3730(h) retaliation action is “a civil\naction under section 3730.” Another reasonable reading is\nthat it applies only to actions arising under §§3730(a) and\n(b), not to §3730(h) retaliation actions. That reading is\nsuggested by the language in §3731(b)(1) tying the start of\nthe time limit to “the date on which the violation of section\n3729 is committed.” In other words, the time limit begins\n6      GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL & WATER CONSERVATION\n          DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto run on the date the defendant submitted a false claim\nfor payment. See supra, at 1. This language casts doubt\non whether §3731(b)(1) specifies a limitations period for\nretaliation actions. For even a well-pleaded retaliation\ncomplaint need not allege that the defendant submitted a\nfalse claim, leaving the limitations period without a start-\ning point if §3731(b)(1) is applicable. A retaliation plain-\ntiff, instead, need prove only that the defendant retaliated\nagainst him for engaging in “lawful acts done . . . in fur-\ntherance of” an FCA “action filed or to be filed,” §3730(h),\nlanguage that protects an employee’s conduct even if the\ntarget of an investigation or action to be filed was inno-\ncent.1 Applying §3731(b)(1) to FCA retaliation actions, then,\nsits uneasily with §3731(b)(1)’s language, which assumes\nthat well-pleaded “action[s] under section 3730” to which it\nis applicable include a “violation of section 3729” certain\nfrom which to start the time running. Section 3731(b)(1), by\ncontrast, naturally applies to well-pleaded §§3730(a) and (b)\nactions. They require the plaintiff to plead that the defen-\ndant submitted a false claim for payment, and therefore\nnecessarily specify when §3731(b)(1)’s time limit begins.\nThis textual anomaly, at a minimum, shows that\n——————\n   1 See United States ex rel. Karvelas v. Melrose-Wakefield Hospital,\n\n360 F. 3d 220, 236 (CA1 2004) (holding that protected conduct is\n“conduct that reasonably could lead to a viable FCA action”); United\nStates ex rel.

We\nendorse none of these formulations; we note only that all of them have\nproperly recognized that proving a violation of §3729 is not an element\nof a §3730(h) cause of action.\n                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n§3731(b)(1) is ambiguous about whether “action under\nsection 3730” means all actions under §3730, or only\n§§3730(a) and (b) actions.\n   Wilson and the United States dispute that the statute\ncontains this anomaly, and instead urge that it clearly\napplies by its terms to all §3730 actions. They point out that\nevery §3730(h) action requires the plaintiff to prove that he\nengaged in protected conduct related to at least a suspected\nviolation of §3729, and argue that §3731(b)(1)’s limitations\nperiod simply begins to run on the date of the suspected\nviolation. Assuming, without deciding, that §3730(h) re-\ntaliation actions have as an element a suspected violation of\n§3729, their interpretation indeed removes the anomaly, but\nonly at the cost of reading into the statute the word “sus-\npected” before the phrase “violation of section 3729.” Sec-\ntion 3731(b)(1) speaks of “violation[s] of section 3729”—\nactual, not suspected, ones. Wilson and the United States\nanswer that this argument proves too much, because even\n§§3730(a) and (b) actions involve only “suspected” violations\nof §3729 at the pleading stage of litigation; but this response\nmisses the point. Every §3730(a) or (b) plaintiff who states\nor proves a valid claim for relief must allege or prove an\nactual violation of §3729; retaliation plaintiffs need only\nallege or prove a suspected violation of §3729 (or so we are\nwilling to assume). The point is that §3731(b)(1)’s language\napplies naturally to all successfully pleaded or proved re-\ntaliation actions only if one reads “suspected” into its terms,\nas the dissent essentially concedes. See post, at 4 (opinion of\nBREYER, J.).\n   Section §3731(b)(1)’s literal text, then, is ambiguous.\nWilson and the Government ask us to read it as if it said\n“the [suspected or actual] violation of section 3729.” Peti-\ntioners ask us to read §3731(b) as if it said “civil action\nunder section 3730[(a) or (b)].”\n   Two considerations convince us that the better way to\nresolve this ambiguity is to read the 6-year period to gov-\n8     GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL & WATER CONSERVATION\n         DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nern only §§3730(a) and (b) actions, and not §3730(h) re-\ntaliation actions. First, the very next subsection of the\nstatute, §3731(c), also uses the similarly unqualified\nphrase “action brought under section 3730” to refer only to\n§§3730(a) and (b) actions. Section 3731(c) provides that\n“[i]n any action brought under section 3730, the United\nStates shall be required to prove all essential elements of\nthe cause of action, including damages, by a preponder-\nance of the evidence.” As Wilson and the United States\nconcede, the context of this provision implies that the\nphrase “any action brought under section 3730” is limited\nto §3730(a) actions brought by the United States and\n§3730(b) actions in which the United States intervenes as\na party, as those are the types of §3730 actions in which\nthe United States necessarily participates. Otherwise, the\nUnited States would be “required to prove all essential\nelements of the cause of action,” §3731(c), in all §3730\nactions, regardless of whether it participated in the action\n(a consequence the dissent implicitly embraces by claiming\nthat “any action brought under section 3730” in §3731(c)\nmeans all §3730 actions, see post, at 2 (opinion of BREYER,\nJ.)). This implicit limitation of the phrase “action under\nsection 3730” shows that Congress used the term “action\nunder section 3730” imprecisely in §3731 and, in particu-\nlar, that Congress sometimes used the term to refer only\nto a subset of §3730 actions. It is reasonable to read the\nsame language in §3731(b)(1) to be likewise limited.\n   Second, reading §3731(b)(1) to apply only to §§3730(a)\nand (b) actions is in keeping with the default rule that\nCongress generally drafts statutes of limitations to begin\nwhen the cause of action accrues. We have repeatedly\nrecognized that Congress legislates against the “standard\nrule that the limitations period commences when the\nplaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.” Bay\nArea Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v.\nFerbar Corp. of Cal., 522 U.

Therefore, where, as the case is here, there are\ntwo plausible constructions of a statute of limitations, we\nshould adopt the construction that starts the time limit\nrunning when the cause of action (here retaliation)\naccrues.2\n   This approach resolves the ambiguity in §3731(b)(1) in\npetitioners’ favor. On the one hand, reading §3731(b)(1) to\nexclude retaliation actions will generally start the limita-\ntions period running when the cause of action accrues.

He argues that §3731(b)(1) does\nnot govern §3730(h) actions because “it is so unlikely that a legislature\nwould actually intend” to start the statute of limitations running before\nthe cause of action accrues that he “would presume that the anomaly\nwas the product of a drafting error” regardless of whether the text is\nambiguous. Dodd v. United States, ante, at __, n. 1 (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting). This is not the proper analysis.

UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBecause that date will precede the retaliatory conduct,\ntheir reading starts the time limit running before the\nretaliation action accrues. Even more oddly, their reading\nallows a retaliation action to be time barred before it ever\naccrues—for example, if the employer discovers more than\nsix years after the suspected violation of §3729 that an\nemployee aided in investigating that fraud, then retali-\nates. As we have discussed, §3731(b)(1)’s text permits a\nconstruction that avoids these counterintuitive results—\nthat “civil action under section 3730” means only those\ncivil actions under §3730 that have as an element a “viola-\ntion of section 3729,” that is, §§3730(a) and (b) actions.\n   Granted, other textual evidence cuts against this read-\ning of §3731(b)(1). In particular, Congress used the phrase\n“brought under subsection (a) or (b) of section 3730” in\n§3731(d); this, it is argued, shows that Congress could\nhave been similarly precise in §3731(b)(1) if it wished. In\nthe context of this statute, however, that argument proves\ntoo much, since the same could be said of §3731(c), which\nall agree uses the phrase “action under section 3730” in\nmore limited, and less precise, fashion. See supra, at 8.\nWe do not doubt that Congress could have drafted\n§3731(b)(1) with more precision than it did, but the pres-\nence of the same inexact wording in §3731(c) means that\nthe more precise language in §3731(d) casts little doubt on\nour reading of the statute.\n                        *    *    *\n  For the reasons we have discussed, the FCA’s express\nlimitations period does not apply to §3730(h) actions.

WILSON\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n                         [June 20, 2005]\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins,\ndissenting.\n   As the Court points out, it is unusual to find a statute of\nlimitations keyed not to the time of the plaintiff’s injury,\nbut to other related events. Still, I believe that Congress\nhas written such a statute here, and we should respect its\ndecision.\n   The language of the statute, 31 U. S. C. §3731(b)(1), is\nreasonably clear. It says that “[a] civil action under sec-\ntion 3730 may not be brought . . . more than 6 years after\nthe date on which the violation” of federal false claims law\n“is committed.” (Emphasis added.) Section 3730 lists\nthree kinds of civil actions, including a retaliation action\nunder §3730(h). Thus, a retaliation action is a “civil action\nunder section 3730,” and §3731(b)(1)’s 6-year limitations\nperiod applies.\n   The Court tries to overcome the force of this syllogism\nwith the help of two textual arguments. First, it points to\nthe subsection that follows §3731(b)—§3731(c)—which\nsays that “ ‘[i]n any action brought under section 3730, the\nUnited States shall be required to prove all essential\nelements of the cause of action, including damages, by a\npreponderance of the evidence.’ ” See ante, at 8. The\nCourt then reasons that, read in context, the phrase “ac-\n2     GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL & WATER CONSERVATION\n         DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntion brought under section 3730” could not refer to all the\ncivil actions listed under §3730, for the United States is\nnot ordinarily a party to private retaliation suits brought\nunder §3730(h). Ibid. Rather, the phrase “action brought\nunder section 3730” must refer only to the false claims\nactions listed in §§3730(a) and (b). Ibid. Thus, according\nto the Court, if in §3731(c), the phrase “action brought\nunder section 3730” refers only to a subset of the actions\nlisted under §3730, one can read the similar phrase in\n§3731(b)(1) to contain a similar limitation. Ibid.\n   The problem with this argument lies in its conclusion.\nThe reason that §3731(c) may apply only to §§3730(a) and\n(b) actions has nothing to do with the phrase “action\nbrought under section 3730.” Rather, any limitation on\n§3731(c)’s application comes from different words, namely,\n“the United States.” These latter words make clear not\nthat the phrase “under section 3730” has a different mean-\ning than in (b), but that (c) comes into play only in cases in\nwhich the United States is a party (and only in such cases,\ncompare ibid.). Because it is these words—the subject of\nthe subsection, “the United States”—that determines\nwhether (c) has application in any given case, there is\nnothing in §3731(c) that would make it “reasonable,” ibid.,\nto read the phrase “action under section 3730” in section\n3731(b)(1) to apply, as the Court concludes, to only “two\nout of three actions under section 3730.”\n   The subsections surrounding §§3731(b) and (c) further\nundermine the Court’s extratextual limitation on “[a] civil\naction under section 3730.” In §3731(a), Congress appar-\nently used the phrase “under section 3730” to mean all\nthree §3730 actions. §3731(a) (a “subpoena requiring the\nattendance of a witness at a trial or hearing conducted\nunder section 3730 of this title may be served at any place\nin the United States”). And in §3731(d), Congress used\nthe very words that the Court seeks to find in §3731(b),\nbut that do not there exist—namely, the words “under\n                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)              3\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsubsection (a) or (b) of section 3730”—when it meant to\nnarrow a provision’s compass to two out of the three §3730\ncauses of action. §3731(d) (“[A] final judgment rendered in\nfavor of the United States in any criminal proceeding\ncharging fraud or false statements . . . shall estop the\ndefendant from denying the essential elements of the\noffense in any action which involves the same transaction\nas in the criminal proceeding and which is brought under\nsubsection (a) or (b) of section 3730”); see also ante, at 12.\nThe statutory context therefore shows that Congress did\nnot intend for the phrase “[a] civil action under section\n3730” to mean anything other than what it says.\n  Second, the Court points to language in §3731(b)(1) that\nspecifies when the limitations period begins to run: “the\ndate on which the violation” of the false claims provision,\n§3729, “is committed.” See ante, at 5–7. It then points out\nthat a retaliation action does not necessarily involve an\nactual false claims violation, because (it assumes) a re-\ntaliation plaintiff need only show “a suspected violation.”\nAnte, at 7 (emphasis in original). Thus, adopting respon-\ndent’s and the Government’s reading, the Court reasons,\nwould require reading some words into §3731(b)(1)—so\nthat it would say “the [suspected or actual] violation”—\nwhich would distort the statute more than reading some\nother, different words into the statute—so that it would\nsay “[a] civil action under section 3730[(a) or (b)].” Ibid.\n  The difficulty with the Court’s choice of the latter lin-\nguistic addition is that the two sets of textual insertions—\non the one hand “suspected or actual,” on the other hand\n“(a) or (b)”—are not equivalent. Statutes of limitations,\nwhen referring to starting points, generally refer not to\nactual events, but to alleged events. Thus, a plaintiff’s\ntort action is timely if he files it within, say, three years of\nthe alleged negligently caused injury; a plaintiff’s breach-\nof-contract action is timely if filed within, say, one year of\nthe alleged breach. And a plaintiff who loses such an\n4     GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL & WATER CONSERVATION\n         DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL.

Rather,\nthe suit is still timely even though the violation remains\nnothing more than “alleged” after trial. Such a plaintiff\nhas simply lost a timely filed action on the merits.\n   The provision before us is no different.           Section\n3731(b)(1)’s 6-year time clock begins to run on “the date on\nwhich the violation” of federal false claims law, §3729, “is\ncommitted.” Thus, any §3730 plaintiff—even one bringing\na false claims action under §3730(a) or §3730(b)—has six\nyears from the moment of a suspected—that is, an un-\nproven—violation of the False Claims Act’s antifraud\nprovision. Thus, as naturally interpreted, the words “the\ndate on which the violation . . . is committed” refer to the\ndate on which the suspected violation occurs.\n   I recognize that there is a relevant distinction in this\ncase. In the typical case (say, the tort or contract case) the\nplaintiff must ultimately prove all the relevant allega-\ntions. Here, the retaliation victim need not prove that her\nemployer did in fact violate federal false claims law, but\nonly that she believed that there was such a violation. See\nibid. But that distinction does not make the difference.\nGiven the clear link between claimed violations of federal\nfalse claims law and retaliation actions (the latter depend\non the former) and given that triggering events in statutes\nof limitations implicitly mean alleged triggering events,\n§3731(b)(1) remains most naturally read as implicitly\nreferring to alleged or suspected violations of federal false\nclaims law. And at the very least, reading the statute in\nthis way, especially in light of the other statutory indica-\ntors, see supra, at 1–3, does far less violence to\n§3731(b)(1)’s text than does the Court’s addition of “(a) or\n(b).”\n   The Court’s far stronger argument is not textual. It\nconcerns the limitations provision’s purpose. That pur-\n                 Cite as: 545 U.

Cf. S. Rep. No. 99–345, p. 34 (1986)\n(addition of a retaliation cause of action intended “to halt\ncompanies . . . from using the threat of economic retalia-\ntion to silence ‘whistleblowers’ ” and to “assure those who\nmay be considering exposing fraud that they are legally\nprotected from retaliatory acts”). How can we reconcile\nthat purpose with a reading of the statute that, as a mat-\nter of logic, could allow the limitations period to begin to\nrun, perhaps even to terminate, before the forbidden\nretaliation occurs? See ante, at 12.\n   The answer, in my view, is that Congress could have\nhad a particular qui tam-related purpose in mind. That is,\nit could have intended to provide a fairly lengthy limita-\ntions period, namely six years from the time the false\nclaims conduct occurs, applicable to all related actions,\nand then to put an end to all such litigation. This makes\nparticular sense given the reasonable assumption that\nfalse claims and retaliation actions are likely to be liti-\ngated together. See, e.g., App. 11–35 (respondent’s com-\nplaint pursuing both qui tam and retaliation claims in\nsame suit); United States ex rel. Lujan v. Hughes Aircraft\nCo., 162 F. 3d 1027, 1030 (CA9 1998) (same).\n   Of course, as the Court emphasizes, such an unusual\nprovision exacts a price, namely possible injury to an\nindividual who suffers retaliation that comes late in the\nday. But apparently there is no such individual. Neither\nthe Court nor petitioners have been able to find any actual\nexample. See, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 5, 6; see also Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 27–28 (United States is\nunaware of any such example). Nor have I.\n   By contrast, the Court’s reading of the statute exacts a\ndifferent, but certain, price. It substitutes for a fairly\nlengthy—and uniform—6-year limitations term, a crazy-\nquilt of limitations periods stitched together from the laws\n6     GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL & WATER CONSERVATION\n         DIST. v.

See,\ne.g., Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §61.103(2) (Lexis 2004) (90-day\nlimitations period for certain whistle-blower actions); Fla.\nStat. Ann. §112.3187(8)(a) (West Supp. 2005) (180-day\nlimitations period); Hughes Aircraft Co., supra, at 1035\n(California’s 1-year limitations period for wrongful termi-\nnation in violation of public policy applies to §3730(h)\naction). Rather than shed crocodile tears for the imagined\nplight of a nonexistent whistle-blower as petitioners ask\nus to do, I would read the statute to do what the statute\nsays Congress wanted: to provide a relatively long, single,\nuniform limitations period that, in practice, seems to\nprotect the many real potential plaintiffs, such as respon-\ndent, who will otherwise find themselves shut out of court.\nSuch a reading also avoids the attendant practical difficul-\nties and uncertainties inherent in requiring federal courts\nto borrow state statutes of limitations. See Jones v. R. R.\nDonnelley & Sons Co., 541 U. S. 369, 377–380, and n. 13\n(2004) (discussing problems with this practice).\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/799981/", "sha1": "e56417c935de5217a82591a571496be2b470651f", "source": "M", "supreme_court_db_id": "2004-066", "time_retrieved": "2012-05-16T20:19:13"}
