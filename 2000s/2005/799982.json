We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>A subsection of Michigan's Motor Carrier Act imposes upon each motor carrier \"for the administration of this act, an annual fee of $100.00 for each self-propelled motor vehicle operated by or on behalf of the motor carrier.\" Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 478.2(1) (West 2002). The provision assesses the fee upon, and only upon, vehicles that engage in intrastate commercial operations \u0097 that is, on trucks that undertake point-to-point hauls between Michigan cities. See <i>Westlake Transp., Inc.</i> v. <i>Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm'n,</i> 255 Mich. App. 589, 592-594, 662 N. W. 2d 784, 789 (2003). Petitioners, USF Holland, Inc., a trucking company with trucks that engage in both interstate and intrastate hauling, and the American Trucking Associations, Inc. (ATA), asked the Michigan courts to invalidate the provision. Both petitioners <span class=\"star-pagination\">*432</span> told those courts that trucks that carry <i>both</i> interstate <i>and</i> intrastate loads engage in intrastate business less than trucks that confine their operations to the Great Lakes State. Hence, because Michigan's fee is flat, it discriminates against interstate carriers and imposes an unconstitutional burden upon interstate trade.</p>\n<p>The Michigan Court of Claims rejected the carriers' claim for three reasons. First, the $100 fee \"is regulatory and intended\" for the Motor Carrier Act's administration, which includes \"regulation of vehicular size and weight, insurance requirements and safety standards.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a. Such a fee \"is not amenable to a fee structure based on apportionment by usage rates.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Second, the fee reflects a \"legitimate expression of the [S]tate's concern that the welfare of its citizens be protected,\" and hence an appropriate exercise of the State's police power. <i>Ibid.</i> Third, the fee does not implicate the Commerce Clause because it falls only on intrastate, not interstate, commerce. <i>Id.,</i> at 45a.</p>\n<p>The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed. It did not agree that the intrastate nature of \u00a7 478.2(1) sheltered the fee from Commerce Clause scrutiny. 255 Mich. App., at 617-619, 662 N. W. 2d, at 802. Nonetheless, the court rejected the truckers' claim because the statute \"regulates evenhandedly,\" <i>id.,</i> at 621, 662 N. W. 2d, at 804, and because the record lacked any \"evidence that any trucking firm's route choices [were] affected by the imposition of the fee,\" <i>id.,</i> at 621, 662 N. W. 2d, at 803-804. Rather, the record indicated that any \"effect . . . on interstate commerce is incidental,\" rendering the truckers' claim of discrimination \"a matter of pure speculation.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Michigan Supreme Court denied petitioners leave to appeal. <i>Westlake Transp., Inc.</i> v. <i>Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm'n,</i> 469 Mich. 976, 673 N. W. 2d 752 (2003). We granted their petition for certiorari and consolidated the case with <i>Mid-Con Freight Systems, Inc.</i> v. <i>Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm'n, post,</i> p. 440, a case in which interstate truckers <span class=\"star-pagination\">*433</span> sought review of a separate state motor carrier fee. We now affirm the Michigan court's judgment sustaining \u00a7 478.2(1).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Our Constitution \"was framed upon the theory that the peoples of the several states must sink or swim together.\" <i>Baldwin</i> v. <i>G. A. F. Seelig, Inc.,</i> 294 U. S. 511, 523 (1935). Thus, this Court has consistently held that the Constitution's express grant to Congress of the power to \"regulate Commerce . . . among the several States,\" Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3, contains \"a further, negative command, known as the dormant Commerce Clause,\" <i>Oklahoma Tax Comm'n</i> v. <i>Jefferson Lines, Inc.,</i> 514 U. S. 175, 179 (1995), that \"create[s] an area of trade free from interference by the States,\" <i>Boston Stock Exchange</i> v. <i>State Tax Comm'n,</i> 429 U. S. 318, 328 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted). This negative command prevents a State from \"jeopardizing the welfare of the Nation as a whole\" by \"plac[ing] burdens on the flow of commerce across its borders that commerce wholly within those borders would not bear.\" <i>Jefferson Lines, supra,</i> at 180.</p>\n<p>Thus, we have found unconstitutional state regulations that unjustifiably discriminate on their face against out-of-state entities, see <i>Philadelphia</i> v. <i>New Jersey,</i> 437 U. S. 617 (1978), or that impose burdens on interstate trade that are \"clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits,\" <i>Pike</i> v. <i>Bruce Church, Inc.,</i> 397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970). We have held that States may not impose taxes that facially discriminate against interstate business and offer commercial advantage to local enterprises, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Oregon Waste Systems, Inc.</i> v. <i>Department of Environmental Quality of Ore.,</i> 511 U. S. 93, 99-100 (1994), that improperly apportion state assessments on transactions with out-of-state components, <i>Central Greyhound Lines, Inc.</i> v. <i>Mealey,</i> 334 U. S. 653 (1948), or that have the \"inevitable effect [of] threaten[ing] the free movement of commerce by placing a financial barrier around the State,\" <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</i> v. <i>Scheiner,</i> 483 U. S. 266, 284 (1987).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*434</span> Applying these principles and precedents, we find nothing in \u00a7 478.2(1) that offends the Commerce Clause. To begin with, Michigan imposes the flat $100 fee only upon intrastate transactions \u0097 that is, upon activities taking place exclusively within the State's borders. Section 478.2(1) does not facially discriminate against interstate or out-of-state activities or enterprises. The statute applies evenhandedly to all carriers that make domestic journeys. It does not reflect an effort to tax activity that takes place, in whole or in part, outside the State. Nothing in our case law suggests that such a neutral, locally focused fee or tax is inconsistent with the dormant Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p>This legal vacuum is not surprising. States impose numerous flat fees upon local businesses and service providers, including, for example, upon insurers, auctioneers, ambulance operators, and hosts of others. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 33-36-104 (Lexis 2003); S. C. Code Ann. \u00a7 38-7-10 (West 2002). Although we have \"long since rejected any suggestion that a state tax . . . affecting interstate commerce is immune from Commerce Clause scrutiny because it attaches only to a `local' or intrastate activity,\" <i>Commonwealth Edison Co.</i> v. <i>Montana,</i> 453 U. S. 609, 615 (1981), we have also made clear that the Constitution neither displaces States' authority \"to shelter [their] people from menaces to their health or safety,\" <i>D. H. Holmes Co.</i> v. <i>McNamara,</i> 486 U. S. 24, 29 (1988) (internal quotation marks omitted), nor \"unduly curtail[s]\" States' power \"to lay taxes for the support of state government,\" <i>McGoldrick</i> v. <i>Berwind-White Coal Mining Co.,</i> 309 U. S. 33, 48 (1940).</p>\n<p>The record, moreover, shows no special circumstance suggesting that Michigan's fee operates in practice as anything other than an unobjectionable exercise of the State's police power. To the contrary, as the Michigan Court of Appeals pointed out, the record contains little, if any, evidence that the $100 fee imposes any significant practical burden upon interstate trade. See 255 Mich. App., at 620-622, 662 N. W. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*435</span> 2d, at 803-804. The record does show, for example, that some interstate trucks \"top off\" some interstate hauls with intrastate pickups and deliveries. See Brief for Intervening Plaintiffs-Appellants in Nos. 226052, 226122 (Ct.App.Mich.), Exh. 3, Affidavit of James C. Crozier \u00b6 7 (licensing and fuel manager of TNT Holland Motor Express, Inc., describing this practice). But it does not tell us the answers to such questions as: How often does \"topping off\" occur across the industry? Does the $100 charge make a difference by significantly discouraging interstate carriers from engaging in \"topping off\"? Does the possibility of obtaining a 72-hour intrastate permit for $10 alleviate the alleged problem? See \u00a7 478.2(3); see also Brief for Respondents 2, n. 3 (4,928 temporary permits were issued in 2004). If the fees ($100 and $10) discourage \"topping off,\" does that <i>local</i> commercial effect make a significant <i>interstate</i> difference? Would a variable fee (of the kind the truckers advocate) eliminate such difference? The minimal facts in the record tell us little about these matters. Compare App. 60-61, Supplemental Affidavit of Thomas R. Lonergan \u00b6 10(e) (official of the Michigan Public Service Commission stating that topping off is rare for most interstate carriers because it disrupts schedules and shipping patterns), with Reply Brief for Intervening Plaintiffs-Appellants in Nos. 226122, 226137 (Ct.App.Mich.), Exh. A, Supplemental Affidavit of James C. Crozier \u00b6 6 (TNT Holland frequently tops off interstate loads). And at oral argument, ATA conceded the absence of record facts that empirically could show that the $100 fee significantly deters interstate trade. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5.</p>\n<p>Neither does the record show that the flat assessment unfairly discriminates against interstate truckers. The fee seeks to defray costs such as those of regulating \"vehicular size and weight,\" of administering \"insurance requirements,\" and of applying \"safety standards.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a. The bulk of such costs would seem more likely to vary per truck or per carrier than to vary per mile traveled. See <span class=\"star-pagination\">*436</span> 255 Mich. App., at 612-617, 662 N. W. 2d, at 799-801. And that fact means that a per-truck, rather than a per-mile, assessment is likely fair. Cf. <i>Jefferson Lines,</i> 514 U. S., at 199 (rejecting taxpayer's discrimination claim in part because \"miles traveled within the State simply are not a relevant proxy for the benefit conferred upon the parties to a sales transaction\"). Nothing in the record suggests the contrary.</p>\n<p>Nor would an effort to switch the manner of fee assessment \u0097 from lump sum to, for example, miles traveled \u0097 be burden free. The record contains an affidavit, sworn by a Michigan Public Service Commission official, that states that to obtain the same revenue (about $3.5 million) through a per-mile fee would require the State to create a \"data accumulation system\" capable of separating out intrastate hauls and determining their length, and to develop related liability, billing, and auditing mechanisms. App. 64, Second Supplemental Affidavit of Thomas R. Lonergan \u00b6 2. This affidavit, on its face, suggests that the game is unlikely to be worth the candle. While petitioners argue the contrary, they do not provide the details of their preferred alternative administrative system nor point to record evidence showing its practicality. See <i>Jefferson Lines, supra,</i> at 195 (State is not required to use a particular apportionment formula just because it may be \"possible\" to do so).</p>\n<p>Petitioners insist that they do not need empirically to demonstrate the existence of a burdensome or discriminatory impact upon interstate trucking, or (presumably) the unfairness of the assessment in relation to defrayed costs, or (presumably) the administrative practicality of the alternatives. They say that our earlier case, <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</i> v. <i>Scheiner,</i> 483 U. S. 266 (1987), requires invalidation of the $100 flat fee, even in the absence of such proof. We disagree.</p>\n<p>In <i>Scheiner,</i> this Court invalidated a flat $25 \"marker fee\" and a flat \"axle tax\" that Pennsylvania levied upon all trucks (interstate and intrastate) that used its roads, including <span class=\"star-pagination\">*437</span> trucks that merely crossed Pennsylvania's borders to transport, say, Ohio goods to New Jersey customers. See <i>id.,</i> at 273-275. Data showed that the fees imposed a cost per mile on interstate trucks that was approximately \"five times as heavy as the cost per mile borne by local trucks.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 286. The assessments largely helped to raise revenue \"to improve and maintain [the State's] highways and bridges,\" <i>id.,</i> at 270, thereby helping to cover costs likely to vary significantly with truck-miles traveled, see <i>ibid.</i> And the assessments did \"not even purport to approximate fairly the cost or value of the use of Pennsylvania's roads.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 290. In light of these considerations, Pennsylvania's lump-sum taxes \"threaten[ed] the free movement of commerce by placing a financial barrier around the State of Pennsylvania.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 284. We concluded that \"[i]f each State imposed flat taxes for the privilege of making commercial entrances into its territory, there [was] no conceivable doubt that commerce among the States would be deterred.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The present fee, as we have said, taxes purely local activity; it does not tax an interstate truck's entry into the State nor does it tax transactions spanning multiple States. See 255 Mich. App., at 592-594, 662 N. W. 2d, at 789. We lack convincing evidence showing that the tax deters, or for that matter discriminates against, interstate activities. See <i>supra</i>, at 434-435. Nor is the tax one that, on its face, would seem to call for an assessment measured per mile rather than per truck. See <i>supra</i>, at 435-436. Consequently, we lack any reason to infer that Michigan's lump-sum levy erects, as in <i>Scheiner,</i> an impermissible discriminatory roadblock.</p>\n<p>Petitioners add that Michigan's fee fails the \"internal consistency\" test \u0097 a test that we have typically used where taxation of interstate transactions is at issue. Generally speaking, that test asks, \"What would happen if all States did the same?\" See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Goldberg</i> v. <i>Sweet,</i> 488 U. S. 252, 261 (1989); <i>Jefferson Lines, supra,</i> at 185 (test looks to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*438</span> structure of the tax to see whether its identical application by every State \"would place interstate commerce at a disadvantage as compared with commerce intrastate\"). We must concede that here, as petitioners argue, if all States did the same, an interstate truck would have to pay fees totaling several hundred dollars, or even several thousand dollars, were it to \"top off\" its business by carrying local loads in many (or even all) other States. But it would have to do so only because it engages in <i>local</i> business in all those States. An interstate firm with local outlets normally expects to pay local fees that are uniformly assessed upon all those who engage in local business, interstate and domestic firms alike. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Commonwealth Edison,</i> 453 U. S., at 623-624 (dormant Commerce Clause does not seek \"to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing business\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. <i>Jefferson Lines, supra,</i> at 187-188 (in context of sales tax, \"the Commerce Clause does not forbid the actual assessment of a succession of taxes by different States on distinct events as the same tangible object flows along\"). A motor carrier is not special in this respect.</p>\n<p>In sum, petitioners have failed to show that Michigan's fee, which does not seek to tax a share of interstate transactions, which focuses upon local activity, and which is assessed evenhandedly, either burdens or discriminates against interstate commerce, or violates the Commerce Clause in any other relevant way. See <i>Complete Auto Transit, Inc.</i> v. <i>Brady,</i> 430 U. S. 274, 279 (1977) (noting that a tax will be sustained where it is applied to an activity with a \"substantial nexus\" to the taxing State; where, if applied to interstate activity, it is \"fairly apportioned\"; where it does not discriminate; and where it is \"fairly related to the services provided\").</p>\n<p>For these reasons, the judgment of the Michigan Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*439</span> JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>Michigan imposes a flat fee on trucks that engage in purely intrastate commercial operations. I agree with the Court that this fee does not violate the negative Commerce Clause. Unlike the Court, <i>ante,</i> at 433, 437-438, I reach that determination without adverting to various tests from our wardrobe of ever-changing negative Commerce Clause fashions: the balancing approach from <i>Pike</i> v. <i>Bruce Church, Inc.,</i> 397 U. S. 137 (1970), the four-factor test from <i>Complete Auto Transit, Inc.</i> v. <i>Brady,</i> 430 U. S. 274 (1977), and the internal-consistency test from cases such as <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</i> v. <i>Scheiner,</i> 483 U. S. 266 (1987). Instead, I ask whether the fee \"facially discriminates against interstate commerce\" and whether it is \"indistinguishable from a type of law previously held unconstitutional by this Court.\" <i>West Lynn Creamery, Inc.</i> v. <i>Healy,</i> 512 U. S. 186, 210 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). As the Court correctly concludes, Michigan's fee meets neither of those conditions. It does not facially discriminate against interstate commerce, <i>ante,</i> at 434, and it is distinguishable from petitioners' best analogue, the fees invalidated in <i>Scheiner,</i> which applied to interstate trucks even when they engaged in <i>no</i> intrastate business, <i>ante,</i> at 436-437.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I would affirm the judgment of the Michigan Court of Appeals because \"`[t]he negative Commerce Clause has no basis in the text of the Constitution, makes little sense, and has proved virtually unworkable in application,' <i>Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc.</i> v. <i>Town of Harrison,</i> 520 U.

Argued April 26, 2005\u2014Decided June 20, 2005\nPetitioners, a trucking company engaged in both interstate and intra-\n  state hauling and a trucking association, asked Michigan courts to\n  invalidate the State\u2019s flat $100 annual fee imposed on trucks engaged\n  in intrastate commercial hauling, see Mich. Comp. Laws Ann.\n  \u00a7478.2(1), claiming that it discriminates against interstate carriers\n  and imposes an unconstitutional burden on interstate trade because\n  trucks carrying both interstate and intrastate loads engage in less in-\n  trastate business than trucks carrying only intrastate loads. The\n  State Court of Claims rejected the claim, holding that, because the\n  fee is regulatory and intended for the Michigan Motor Carrier Act\u2019s\n  administration, it is not amenable to apportionment; that it is an ap-\n  propriate exercise of the State\u2019s police power; and that it does not im-\n  plicate the Commerce Clause because it falls only on intrastate com-\n  merce. The State Court of Appeals affirmed, and the State Supreme\n  Court declined review.\nHeld: Michigan\u2019s fee does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause.\n That Clause prevents a State from \u201cjeopardizing the welfare of the\n Nation as a whole\u201d by \u201cplac[ing] burdens on the flow of commerce\n across its borders that commerce wholly within those borders would\n not bear.\u201d Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n v.

The flat fee is imposed only on intrastate transactions. It\n does not facially discriminate against interstate or out-of-state activi-\n ties or enterprises. It applies evenhandedly to all carriers making\n domestic journeys and does not reflect an effort to tax activity taking\n place outside of the State. Nothing in this Court\u2019s case law suggests\n that such a neutral, locally focused fee or tax is inconsistent with the\n2         AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. MICHIGAN\n                     PUB. SERV. COMM\u2019N\n                           Syllabus\n\n    dormant Commerce Clause. That is not surprising, since States im-\n    pose numerous flat fees on local business and service providers, e.g.,\n    insurers and auctioneers. The Constitution neither displaces States\u2019\n    authority to shelter their people from health and safety menaces nor\n    unduly curtails their power to lay taxes to support state government.\n    The record, moreover, shows no special circumstances suggesting\n    that Michigan\u2019s fee operates as anything other than an unobjection-\n    able exercise of the State\u2019s police power. Neither does it show that\n    the flat assessment unfairly discriminates against interstate truck-\n    ers. Because the costs the fee seeks to defray, e.g., those of regulating\n    vehicular size and weight, would seem more likely to vary per truck\n    or per carrier than per-mile traveled, a per-truck, rather than a per-\n    mile, assessment is likely fair. And petitioners provide no details of\n    their preferred alternative miles-traveled system or point to evidence\n    of its practicality.

MICHIGAN\n       PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION ET AL.\n  ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF\n                     MICHIGAN\n                                 [June 20, 2005]\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In this case, we consider whether a flat $100 fee that\nMichigan charges trucks engaging in intrastate commer-\ncial hauling violates the dormant Commerce Clause. We\nhold that it does not.\n                             I\n  A subsection of Michigan\u2019s Motor Carrier Act imposes\nupon each motor carrier \u201cfor the administration of this act,\nan annual fee of $100.00 for each self-propelled motor\nvehicle operated by or on behalf of the motor carrier.\u201d\nMich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7478.2(1) (West 2002). The provi-\nsion assesses the fee upon, and only upon, vehicles that\nengage in intrastate commercial operations\u2014that is, on\ntrucks that undertake point-to-point hauls between Michi-\ngan cities. See Westlake Transp., Inc. v. Michigan Pub.\nServ. Comm\u2019n, 255 Mich. App. 589, 592\u2013594, 662 N. W. 2d\n784, 789 (2003). Petitioners, USF Holland, Inc., a truck-\ning company with trucks that engage in both interstate\nand intrastate hauling, and the American Trucking Asso-\nciations, Inc. (ATA), asked the Michigan courts to invali-\n2      AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. MICHIGAN\n                  PUB. SERV. COMM\u2019N\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\ndate the provision. Both petitioners told those courts that\ntrucks that carry both interstate and intrastate loads\nengage in intrastate business less than trucks that confine\ntheir operations to the Great Lakes State. Hence, because\nMichigan\u2019s fee is flat, it discriminates against interstate\ncarriers and imposes an unconstitutional burden upon\ninterstate trade.\n   The Michigan Court of Claims rejected the carriers\u2019\nclaim for three reasons. First, the $100 fee \u201cis regulatory\nand intended\u201d for the Motor Carrier Act\u2019s administration,\nwhich includes \u201cregulation of vehicular size and weight,\ninsurance requirements and safety standards.\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 44a. Such a fee \u201cis not amenable to a fee\nstructure based on apportionment by usage rates.\u201d Ibid.\nSecond, the fee reflects a \u201clegitimate expression of the\n[S]tate\u2019s concern that the welfare of its citizens be pro-\ntected,\u201d and hence an appropriate exercise of the State\u2019s\npolice power. Ibid. Third, the fee does not implicate the\nCommerce Clause because it falls only on intrastate, not\ninterstate, commerce. Id., at 45a.\n   The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed. It did not\nagree that the intrastate nature of \u00a7478.2(1) sheltered the\nfee from Commerce Clause scrutiny. 255 Mich. App., at\n617\u2013619, 662 N. W. 2d, at 802. Nonetheless, the court\nrejected the truckers\u2019 claim because the statute \u201cregulates\nevenhandedly,\u201d id., at 621, 662 N. W. 2d, at 804, and\nbecause the record lacked any \u201cevidence that any trucking\nfirm\u2019s route choices [were] affected by the imposition of the\nfee,\u201d id., at 621, 662 N. W. 2d, at 803\u2013804. Rather, the\nrecord indicated that any \u201ceffect . . . on interstate com-\nmerce is incidental,\u201d rendering the truckers\u2019 claim of\ndiscrimination \u201ca matter of pure speculation.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Michigan Supreme Court denied petitioners leave\nto appeal.

Comm\u2019n, No. 03\u20131234, a case in which interstate\ntruckers sought review of a separate state motor carrier\nfee. We now affirm the Michigan court\u2019s judgment sus-\ntaining \u00a7478.2(1).\n                              II\n   Our Constitution \u201cwas framed upon the theory that the\npeoples of the several states must sink or swim together.\u201d\nBaldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U. S. 511, 523 (1935).\nThus, this Court has consistently held that the Constitu-\ntion\u2019s express grant to Congress of the power to \u201cregulate\nCommerce . . . among the several States,\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 3,\ncontains \u201ca further, negative command, known as the\ndormant Commerce Clause,\u201d Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n v.\nJefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U. S. 175, 179 (1995), that \u201ccre-\nate[s] an area of trade free from interference by the\nStates,\u201d Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm\u2019n, 429\nU. S. 318, 328 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThis negative command prevents a State from \u201cjeopardiz-\ning the welfare of the Nation as a whole\u201d by \u201cplac[ing]\nburdens on the flow of commerce across its borders that\ncommerce wholly within those borders would not bear.\u201d\nJefferson Lines, supra, at 180.\n   Thus, we have found unconstitutional state regulations\nthat unjustifiably discriminate on their face against out-\nof-state entities, see Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S.\n617 (1978), or that impose burdens on interstate trade that\nare \u201cclearly excessive in relation to the putative local\nbenefits,\u201d Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142\n(1970). We have held that States may not impose taxes\nthat facially discriminate against interstate business and\noffer commercial advantage to local enterprises, see, e.g.,\nOregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of Environmental\nQuality of Ore., 511 U. S. 93, 99\u2013100 (1994), that improp-\nerly apportion state assessments on transactions with out-\n4      AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. MICHIGAN\n                  PUB. SERV. COMM\u2019N\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nof-state components, Central Greyhound Lines, Inc. v.\nMealey, 334 U. S. 653 (1948), or that have the \u201cinevitable\neffect [of] threaten[ing] the free movement of commerce by\nplacing a financial barrier around the State,\u201d American\nTrucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266, 284 (1987).\n   Applying these principles and precedents, we find noth-\ning in \u00a7478.2(1) that offends the Commerce Clause. To\nbegin with, Michigan imposes the flat $100 fee only upon\nintrastate transactions\u2014that is, upon activities taking\nplace exclusively within the State\u2019s borders. Section\n478.2(1) does not facially discriminate against interstate\nor out-of-state activities or enterprises. The statute ap-\nplies evenhandedly to all carriers that make domestic\njourneys. It does not reflect an effort to tax activity that\ntakes place, in whole or in part, outside the State. Noth-\ning in our case law suggests that such a neutral, locally\nfocused fee or tax is inconsistent with the dormant Com-\nmerce Clause.\n   This legal vacuum is not surprising. States impose\nnumerous flat fees upon local businesses and service\nproviders, including, for example, upon insurers, auction-\neers, ambulance operators, and hosts of others. See, e.g.,\nWyo. Stat. \u00a733\u201336\u2013104 (Lexis 2003); S. C. Code Ann. \u00a738\u2013\n7\u201310 (West 2002). Although we have \u201clong since rejected\nany suggestion that a state tax . . . affecting interstate\ncommerce is immune from Commerce Clause scrutiny\nbecause it attaches only to a \u2018local\u2019 or intrastate activity,\u201d\nCommonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 615\n(1981), we have also made clear that the Constitution\nneither displaces States\u2019 authority \u201cto shelter [their] peo-\nple from menaces to their health or safety,\u201d D. H.

S. ____ (2005)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The record, moreover, shows no special circumstance\nsuggesting that Michigan\u2019s fee operates in practice as\nanything other than an unobjectionable exercise of the\nState\u2019s police power. To the contrary, as the Michigan\nCourt of Appeals pointed out, the record contains little, if\nany, evidence that the $100 fee imposes any significant\npractical burden upon interstate trade. See 255 Mich.\nApp., at 620\u2013622, 662 N. W. 2d, at 803\u2013804. The record\ndoes show, for example, that some interstate trucks \u201ctop\noff\u201d some interstate hauls with intrastate pickups and\ndeliveries. See Brief for Intervening Plaintiffs-Appellants\nin Nos. 226052, 226122 (Ct. App. Mich.), Exh. 3, Affidavit\nof James C. Crozier \u00b67 (licensing and fuel manager of TNT\nHolland Motor Express, Inc. describing this practice). But\nit does not tell us the answers to such questions as: How\noften does \u201ctopping off\u201d occur across the industry? Does\nthe $100 charge make a difference by significantly dis-\ncouraging interstate carriers from engaging in \u201ctopping\noff\u201d? Does the possibility of obtaining a 72-hour intrastate\npermit for $10 alleviate the alleged problem?             See\n\u00a7478.2(3); see also Brief for Respondents 2, n. 3 (4,928 tem-\nporary permits were issued in 2004). If the fees ($100 and\n$10) discourage \u201ctopping off,\u201d does that local commercial\neffect make a significant interstate difference? Would a\nvariable fee (of the kind the truckers advocate) eliminate\nsuch difference? The minimal facts in the record tell us\nlittle about these matters. Compare App. 60\u201361, Supple-\nmental Affidavit of Thomas R. Lonergan \u00b610(e) (official of\nthe Michigan Public Service Commission stating that top-\nping off is rare for most interstate carriers because it dis-\nrupts schedules and shipping patterns), with Reply Brief for\nIntervening Plaintiffs-Appellants in Nos. 226122, 226137\n(Ct. App. Mich.), Exh. A, Supplemental Affidavit of James\nC. Crozier \u00b66 (TNT Holland frequently tops off interstate\nloads). And at oral argument, ATA conceded the absence\nof record facts that empirically could show that the $100\n6      AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. MICHIGAN\n                  PUB. SERV. COMM\u2019N\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nfee significantly deters interstate trade. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5.\n   Neither does the record show that the flat assessment\nunfairly discriminates against interstate truckers. The fee\nseeks to defray costs such as those of regulating \u201cvehicular\nsize and weight,\u201d of administering \u201cinsurance require-\nments,\u201d and of applying \u201csafety standards.\u201d App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 44a. The bulk of such costs would seem more\nlikely to vary per truck or per carrier than to vary per-mile\ntraveled. See 255 Mich. App., at 612\u2013617, 662 N. W. 2d,\nat 799\u2013801. And that fact means that a per-truck, rather\nthan a per-mile, assessment is likely fair. Cf. Jefferson\nLines, 514 U. S., at 199 (rejecting taxpayer\u2019s discrimination\nclaim in part because \u201cmiles traveled within the State sim-\nply are not a relevant proxy for the benefit conferred upon\nthe parties to a sales transaction\u201d). Nothing in the record\nsuggests the contrary.\n   Nor would an effort to switch the manner of fee assess-\nment\u2014from lump sum to, for example, miles traveled\u2014be\nburden free. The record contains an affidavit, sworn by a\nMichigan Public Service Commission official, that states\nthat to obtain the same revenue (about $3.5 million)\nthrough a per-mile fee would require the State to create a\n\u201cdata accumulation system\u201d capable of separating out\nintrastate hauls and determining their length, and to\ndevelop related liability, billing, and auditing mecha-\nnisms. App. 64, Second Supplemental Affidavit of Thomas\nR. Lonergan \u00b62. This affidavit, on its face, suggests that\nthe game is unlikely to be worth the candle. While peti-\ntioners argue the contrary, they do not provide the details\nof their preferred alternative administrative system nor\npoint to record evidence showing its practicality. See\nJefferson Lines, supra, at 195 (State is not required to use\na particular apportionment formula just because it may be\n\u201cpossible\u201d to do so).\n   Petitioners insist that they do not need empirically to\ndemonstrate the existence of a burdensome or discrimina-\n                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntory impact upon interstate trucking, or (presumably) the\nunfairness of the assessment in relation to defrayed costs,\nor (presumably) the administrative practicality of the\nalternatives. They say that our earlier case, American\nTrucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266 (1987),\nrequires invalidation of the $100 flat fee, even in the ab-\nsence of such proof. We disagree.\n   In Scheiner, this Court invalidated a flat $25 \u201cmarker\nfee\u201d and a flat \u201caxle tax\u201d that Pennsylvania levied upon all\ntrucks (interstate and intrastate) that used its roads,\nincluding trucks that merely crossed Pennsylvania\u2019s bor-\nders to transport, say, Ohio goods to New Jersey custom-\ners. See id., at 273\u2013275. Data showed that the fees im-\nposed a cost per mile on interstate trucks that was\napproximately \u201cfive times as heavy as the cost per mile\nborne by local trucks.\u201d Id., at 286. The assessments\nlargely helped to raise revenue \u201cto improve and maintain\n[the State\u2019s] highways and bridges,\u201d id., at 270, thereby\nhelping to cover costs likely to vary significantly with\ntruck-miles traveled, see ibid. And the assessments did\n\u201cnot even purport to approximate fairly the cost or value of\nthe use of Pennsylvania\u2019s roads.\u201d Id., at 290. In light of\nthese considerations, Pennsylvania\u2019s lump-sum taxes\n\u201cthreaten[ed] the free movement of commerce by placing a\nfinancial barrier around the State of Pennsylvania.\u201d Id.,\nat 284. We concluded that \u201c[i]f each State imposed flat\ntaxes for the privilege of making commercial entrances\ninto its territory, there [was] no conceivable doubt that\ncommerce among the States would be deterred.\u201d Ibid.\n   The present fee, as we have said, taxes purely local\nactivity; it does not tax an interstate truck\u2019s entry into the\nState nor does it tax transactions spanning multiple\nStates. See 255 Mich. App., at 592\u2013594, 662 N. W. 2d, at\n789. We lack convincing evidence showing that the tax\ndeters, or for that matter discriminates against, interstate\nactivities. See supra, at 5. Nor is the tax one that, on its\n8      AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. MICHIGAN\n                  PUB. SERV. COMM\u2019N\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nface, would seem to call for an assessment measured per\nmile rather than per truck. See supra, at 6. Conse-\nquently, we lack any reason to infer that Michigan\u2019s lump-\nsum levy erects, as in Scheiner, an impermissible dis-\ncriminatory road block.\n   Petitioners add that Michigan\u2019s fee fails the \u201cinternal\nconsistency\u201d test\u2014a test that we have typically used\nwhere taxation of interstate transactions are at issue.\nGenerally speaking, that test asks, \u201cWhat would happen if\nall States did the same?\u201d See, e.g., Goldberg v. Sweet, 488\nU. S. 252, 261 (1989); Jefferson Lines, supra, at 185 (test\nlooks to the structure of the tax to see whether its identi-\ncal application by every State \u201cwould place interstate\ncommerce at a disadvantage as compared with commerce\nintrastate\u201d). We must concede that here, as petitioners\nargue, if all States did the same, an interstate truck would\nhave to pay fees totaling several hundred dollars, or even\nseveral thousand dollars, were it to \u201ctop off\u201d its business\nby carrying local loads in many (or even all) other States.\nBut it would have to do so only because it engages in local\nbusiness in all those States. An interstate firm with local\noutlets normally expects to pay local fees that are uni-\nformly assessed upon all those who engage in local busi-\nness, interstate and domestic firms alike. See, e.g., Com-\nmonwealth Edison, 453 U. S., at 623\u2013624 (dormant\nCommerce Clause does not seek \u201cto relieve those engaged\nin interstate commerce from their just share of state tax\nburden even though it increases the cost of doing busi-\nness\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf.

We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>A subsection of Michigan's Motor Carrier Act imposes upon each motor carrier \"for the administration of this act, an annual fee of $100.00 for each self-propelled motor vehicle operated by or on behalf of the motor carrier.\" Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 478.2(1) (West 2002). The provision assesses the fee upon, and only upon, vehicles that engage in intrastate commercial operations \u0097 that is, on trucks that undertake point-to-point hauls between Michigan cities. See <i>Westlake Transp., Inc.</i> v. <i>Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1607911\"><a href=\"/opinion/1607911/westlake-transportation-inc-v-psc/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></a></span>, 592-594, 662 N. W. 2d 784, 789 (2003). Petitioners, USF Holland, Inc., a trucking company with trucks that engage in both interstate and intrastate hauling, and the American Trucking Associations, Inc. (ATA), asked the Michigan courts to invalidate the provision. Both petitioners <span class=\"star-pagination\">*432</span> told those courts that trucks that carry <i>both</i> interstate <i>and</i> intrastate loads engage in intrastate business less than trucks that confine their operations to the Great Lakes State. Hence, because Michigan's fee is flat, it discriminates against interstate carriers and imposes an unconstitutional burden upon interstate trade.</p>\n<p>The Michigan Court of Claims rejected the carriers' claim for three reasons. First, the $100 fee \"is regulatory and intended\" for the Motor Carrier Act's administration, which includes \"regulation of vehicular size and weight, insurance requirements and safety standards.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a. Such a fee \"is not amenable to a fee structure based on apportionment by usage rates.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Second, the fee reflects a \"legitimate expression of the [S]tate's concern that the welfare of its citizens be protected,\" and hence an appropriate exercise of the State's police power. <i>Ibid.</i> Third, the fee does not implicate the Commerce Clause because it falls only on intrastate, not interstate, commerce. <i>Id.,</i> at 45a.</p>\n<p>The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed. It did not agree that the intrastate nature of \u00a7 478.2(1) sheltered the fee from Commerce Clause scrutiny. 255 Mich. App., at 617-619, 662 N. W. 2d, at 802. Nonetheless, the court rejected the truckers' claim because the statute \"regulates evenhandedly,\" <i>id.,</i> at 621, 662 N. W. 2d, at 804, and because the record lacked any \"evidence that any trucking firm's route choices [were] affected by the imposition of the fee,\" <i>id.,</i> at 621, 662 N. W. 2d, at 803-804. Rather, the record indicated that any \"effect . . . on interstate commerce is incidental,\" rendering the truckers' claim of discrimination \"a matter of pure speculation.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Michigan Supreme Court denied petitioners leave to appeal. <i>Westlake Transp., Inc.</i> v. <i>Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">976</span></span>, 673 N. W. 2d 752 (2003). We granted their petition for certiorari and consolidated the case with <i>Mid-Con Freight Systems, Inc.</i> v. <i>Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm'n, post,</i> p. 440, a case in which interstate truckers <span class=\"star-pagination\">*433</span> sought review of a separate state motor carrier fee. We now affirm the Michigan court's judgment sustaining \u00a7 478.2(1).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Our Constitution \"was framed upon the theory that the peoples of the several states must sink or swim together.\" <i>Baldwin</i> v. <i>G. A. F. Seelig, Inc.,</i> 294 U. S. 511, 523 (1935). Thus, this Court has consistently held that the Constitution's express grant to Congress of the power to \"regulate Commerce . . . among the several States,\" Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3, contains \"a further, negative command, known as the dormant Commerce Clause,\" <i>Oklahoma Tax Comm'n</i> v. <i>Jefferson Lines, Inc.,</i> 514 U. S. 175, 179 (1995), that \"create[s] an area of trade free from interference by the States,\" <i>Boston Stock Exchange</i> v. <i>State Tax Comm'n,</i> 429 U. S. 318, 328 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted). This negative command prevents a State from \"jeopardizing the welfare of the Nation as a whole\" by \"plac[ing] burdens on the flow of commerce across its borders that commerce wholly within those borders would not bear.\" <i>Jefferson Lines, supra,</i> at 180.</p>\n<p>Thus, we have found unconstitutional state regulations that unjustifiably discriminate on their face against out-of-state entities, see <i>Philadelphia</i> v. <i>New Jersey,</i> 437 U. S. 617 (1978), or that impose burdens on interstate trade that are \"clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits,\" <i>Pike</i> v. <i>Bruce Church, Inc.,</i> 397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970). We have held that States may not impose taxes that facially discriminate against interstate business and offer commercial advantage to local enterprises, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Oregon Waste Systems, Inc.</i> v. <i>Department of Environmental Quality of Ore.,</i> 511 U. S. 93, 99-100 (1994), that improperly apportion state assessments on transactions with out-of-state components, <i>Central Greyhound Lines, Inc.</i> v. <i>Mealey,</i> 334 U. S. 653 (1948), or that have the \"inevitable effect [of] threaten[ing] the free movement of commerce by placing a financial barrier around the State,\" <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</i> v. <i>Scheiner,</i> 483 U. S. 266, 284 (1987).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*434</span> Applying these principles and precedents, we find nothing in \u00a7 478.2(1) that offends the Commerce Clause. To begin with, Michigan imposes the flat $100 fee only upon intrastate transactions \u0097 that is, upon activities taking place exclusively within the State's borders. Section 478.2(1) does not facially discriminate against interstate or out-of-state activities or enterprises. The statute applies evenhandedly to all carriers that make domestic journeys. It does not reflect an effort to tax activity that takes place, in whole or in part, outside the State. Nothing in our case law suggests that such a neutral, locally focused fee or tax is inconsistent with the dormant Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p>This legal vacuum is not surprising. States impose numerous flat fees upon local businesses and service providers, including, for example, upon insurers, auctioneers, ambulance operators, and hosts of others. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 33-36-104 (Lexis 2003); S. C. Code Ann. \u00a7 38-7-10 (West 2002). Although we have \"long since rejected any suggestion that a state tax . . . affecting interstate commerce is immune from Commerce Clause scrutiny because it attaches only to a `local' or intrastate activity,\" <i>Commonwealth Edison Co.</i> v. <i>Montana,</i> 453 U. S. 609, 615 (1981), we have also made clear that the Constitution neither displaces States' authority \"to shelter [their] people from menaces to their health or safety,\" <i>D. H. Holmes Co.</i> v. <i>McNamara,</i> 486 U. S. 24, 29 (1988) (internal quotation marks omitted), nor \"unduly curtail[s]\" States' power \"to lay taxes for the support of state government,\" <i>McGoldrick</i> v. <i>Berwind-White Coal Mining Co.,</i> 309 U. S. 33, 48 (1940).</p>\n<p>The record, moreover, shows no special circumstance suggesting that Michigan's fee operates in practice as anything other than an unobjectionable exercise of the State's police power. To the contrary, as the Michigan Court of Appeals pointed out, the record contains little, if any, evidence that the $100 fee imposes any significant practical burden upon interstate trade. See 255 Mich. App., at 620-622, 662 N. W. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*435</span> 2d, at 803-804. The record does show, for example, that some interstate trucks \"top off\" some interstate hauls with intrastate pickups and deliveries. See Brief for Intervening Plaintiffs-Appellants in Nos. 226052, 226122 (Ct.App.Mich.), Exh. 3, Affidavit of James C. Crozier \u00b6 7 (licensing and fuel manager of TNT Holland Motor Express, Inc., describing this practice). But it does not tell us the answers to such questions as: How often does \"topping off\" occur across the industry? Does the $100 charge make a difference by significantly discouraging interstate carriers from engaging in \"topping off\"? Does the possibility of obtaining a 72-hour intrastate permit for $10 alleviate the alleged problem? See \u00a7 478.2(3); see also Brief for Respondents 2, n. 3 (4,928 temporary permits were issued in 2004). If the fees ($100 and $10) discourage \"topping off,\" does that <i>local</i> commercial effect make a significant <i>interstate</i> difference? Would a variable fee (of the kind the truckers advocate) eliminate such difference? The minimal facts in the record tell us little about these matters. Compare App. 60-61, Supplemental Affidavit of Thomas R. Lonergan \u00b6 10(e) (official of the Michigan Public Service Commission stating that topping off is rare for most interstate carriers because it disrupts schedules and shipping patterns), with Reply Brief for Intervening Plaintiffs-Appellants in Nos. 226122, 226137 (Ct.App.Mich.), Exh. A, Supplemental Affidavit of James C. Crozier \u00b6 6 (TNT Holland frequently tops off interstate loads). And at oral argument, ATA conceded the absence of record facts that empirically could show that the $100 fee significantly deters interstate trade. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5.</p>\n<p>Neither does the record show that the flat assessment unfairly discriminates against interstate truckers. The fee seeks to defray costs such as those of regulating \"vehicular size and weight,\" of administering \"insurance requirements,\" and of applying \"safety standards.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a. The bulk of such costs would seem more likely to vary per truck or per carrier than to vary per mile traveled. See <span class=\"star-pagination\">*436</span> 255 Mich. App., at 612-617, 662 N. W. 2d, at 799-801. And that fact means that a per-truck, rather than a per-mile, assessment is likely fair. Cf. <i>Jefferson Lines,</i> 514 U. S., at 199 (rejecting taxpayer's discrimination claim in part because \"miles traveled within the State simply are not a relevant proxy for the benefit conferred upon the parties to a sales transaction\"). Nothing in the record suggests the contrary.</p>\n<p>Nor would an effort to switch the manner of fee assessment \u0097 from lump sum to, for example, miles traveled \u0097 be burden free. The record contains an affidavit, sworn by a Michigan Public Service Commission official, that states that to obtain the same revenue (about $3.5 million) through a per-mile fee would require the State to create a \"data accumulation system\" capable of separating out intrastate hauls and determining their length, and to develop related liability, billing, and auditing mechanisms. App. 64, Second Supplemental Affidavit of Thomas R. Lonergan \u00b6 2. This affidavit, on its face, suggests that the game is unlikely to be worth the candle. While petitioners argue the contrary, they do not provide the details of their preferred alternative administrative system nor point to record evidence showing its practicality. See <i>Jefferson Lines, supra,</i> at 195 (State is not required to use a particular apportionment formula just because it may be \"possible\" to do so).</p>\n<p>Petitioners insist that they do not need empirically to demonstrate the existence of a burdensome or discriminatory impact upon interstate trucking, or (presumably) the unfairness of the assessment in relation to defrayed costs, or (presumably) the administrative practicality of the alternatives. They say that our earlier case, <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</i> v. <i>Scheiner,</i> 483 U. S. 266 (1987), requires invalidation of the $100 flat fee, even in the absence of such proof. We disagree.</p>\n<p>In <i>Scheiner,</i> this Court invalidated a flat $25 \"marker fee\" and a flat \"axle tax\" that Pennsylvania levied upon all trucks (interstate and intrastate) that used its roads, including <span class=\"star-pagination\">*437</span> trucks that merely crossed Pennsylvania's borders to transport, say, Ohio goods to New Jersey customers. See <i>id.,</i> at 273-275. Data showed that the fees imposed a cost per mile on interstate trucks that was approximately \"five times as heavy as the cost per mile borne by local trucks.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 286. The assessments largely helped to raise revenue \"to improve and maintain [the State's] highways and bridges,\" <i>id.,</i> at 270, thereby helping to cover costs likely to vary significantly with truck-miles traveled, see <i>ibid.</i> And the assessments did \"not even purport to approximate fairly the cost or value of the use of Pennsylvania's roads.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 290. In light of these considerations, Pennsylvania's lump-sum taxes \"threaten[ed] the free movement of commerce by placing a financial barrier around the State of Pennsylvania.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 284. We concluded that \"[i]f each State imposed flat taxes for the privilege of making commercial entrances into its territory, there [was] no conceivable doubt that commerce among the States would be deterred.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The present fee, as we have said, taxes purely local activity; it does not tax an interstate truck's entry into the State nor does it tax transactions spanning multiple States. See 255 Mich. App., at 592-594, 662 N. W. 2d, at 789. We lack convincing evidence showing that the tax deters, or for that matter discriminates against, interstate activities. See <i>supra</i>, at 434-435. Nor is the tax one that, on its face, would seem to call for an assessment measured per mile rather than per truck. See <i>supra</i>, at 435-436. Consequently, we lack any reason to infer that Michigan's lump-sum levy erects, as in <i>Scheiner,</i> an impermissible discriminatory roadblock.</p>\n<p>Petitioners add that Michigan's fee fails the \"internal consistency\" test \u0097 a test that we have typically used where taxation of interstate transactions is at issue. Generally speaking, that test asks, \"What would happen if all States did the same?\" See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Goldberg</i> v. <i>Sweet,</i> 488 U. S. 252, 261 (1989); <i>Jefferson Lines, supra,</i> at 185 (test looks to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*438</span> structure of the tax to see whether its identical application by every State \"would place interstate commerce at a disadvantage as compared with commerce intrastate\"). We must concede that here, as petitioners argue, if all States did the same, an interstate truck would have to pay fees totaling several hundred dollars, or even several thousand dollars, were it to \"top off\" its business by carrying local loads in many (or even all) other States. But it would have to do so only because it engages in <i>local</i> business in all those States. An interstate firm with local outlets normally expects to pay local fees that are uniformly assessed upon all those who engage in local business, interstate and domestic firms alike. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Commonwealth Edison,</i> 453 U. S., at 623-624 (dormant Commerce Clause does not seek \"to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing business\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. <i>Jefferson Lines, supra,</i> at 187-188 (in context of sales tax, \"the Commerce Clause does not forbid the actual assessment of a succession of taxes by different States on distinct events as the same tangible object flows along\"). A motor carrier is not special in this respect.</p>\n<p>In sum, petitioners have failed to show that Michigan's fee, which does not seek to tax a share of interstate transactions, which focuses upon local activity, and which is assessed evenhandedly, either burdens or discriminates against interstate commerce, or violates the Commerce Clause in any other relevant way. See <i>Complete Auto Transit, Inc.</i> v. <i>Brady,</i> 430 U. S. 274, 279 (1977) (noting that a tax will be sustained where it is applied to an activity with a \"substantial nexus\" to the taxing State; where, if applied to interstate activity, it is \"fairly apportioned\"; where it does not discriminate; and where it is \"fairly related to the services provided\").</p>\n<p>For these reasons, the judgment of the Michigan Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*439</span> JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>Michigan imposes a flat fee on trucks that engage in purely intrastate commercial operations. I agree with the Court that this fee does not violate the negative Commerce Clause. Unlike the Court, <i>ante,</i> at 433, 437-438, I reach that determination without adverting to various tests from our wardrobe of ever-changing negative Commerce Clause fashions: the balancing approach from <i>Pike</i> v. <i>Bruce Church, Inc.,</i> 397 U. S. 137 (1970), the four-factor test from <i>Complete Auto Transit, Inc.</i> v. <i>Brady,</i> 430 U. S. 274 (1977), and the internal-consistency test from cases such as <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</i> v. <i>Scheiner,</i> 483 U. S. 266 (1987). Instead, I ask whether the fee \"facially discriminates against interstate commerce\" and whether it is \"indistinguishable from a type of law previously held unconstitutional by this Court.\" <i>West Lynn Creamery, Inc.</i> v. <i>Healy,</i> 512 U. S. 186, 210 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). As the Court correctly concludes, Michigan's fee meets neither of those conditions. It does not facially discriminate against interstate commerce, <i>ante,</i> at 434, and it is distinguishable from petitioners' best analogue, the fees invalidated in <i>Scheiner,</i> which applied to interstate trucks even when they engaged in <i>no</i> intrastate business, <i>ante,</i> at 436-437.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I would affirm the judgment of the Michigan Court of Appeals because \"`[t]he negative Commerce Clause has no basis in the text of the Constitution, makes little sense, and has proved virtually unworkable in application,' <i>Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc.</i> v. <i>Town of Harrison,</i> 520 U.
