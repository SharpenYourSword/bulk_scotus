A Michigan law imposes \"an annual fee of $100.00\" upon each Michigan license-plated truck that is \"operating entirely in interstate commerce.\" Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 478.2(2) (West 2002) (hereinafter MCL). A federal statute states that \"a <i>State registration requirement</i> . . . is an unreasonable burden\" upon interstate commerce when it imposes so high a fee. 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b) (emphasis added); see also \u00a7 14504(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III). Does this federal statutory provision pre-empt the Michigan law? We conclude that the Michigan fee requirement is not the kind of \"State registration requirement\" to which the federal statute refers. And for that reason, the statute does not pre-empt it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Federal law has long required most motor carriers doing interstate business to obtain a permit \u0097 which we shall call a Federal Permit \u0097 that reflects compliance with certain federal requirements. See 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 13901 <i>et seq.;</i> 49 CFR \u00a7 365.101 <i>et seq.</i> (2004). In 1965, Congress authorized States to require proof that the operator of an interstate truck had secured a Federal Permit. 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 302(b)(2) (1976 ed.); <span class=\"star-pagination\">*443</span> see generally <i>Yellow Transp., Inc.</i> v. <i>Michigan,</i> 537 U. S. 36, 39 (2002). By 1991, 39 States demanded such proof by requiring some form of what we shall call State Registration (of the Federal Permit). Those States typically would require truckers to file with a state agency evidence that each interstate truck was covered by a Federal Permit. They would require the trucker to pay a State Registration fee of up to $10 per truck. And they would issue a State Registration stamp that the trucker would affix to a multistate \"bingo card\" carried within the vehicle. See 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 1023.32, 1023.33 (1990); <i>Yellow Transp.,</i> 537 U. S., at 39.</p>\n<p>In 1991, Congress focused upon the fact that the \"bingo card\" system required a trucking company to obtain a separate stamp from each State through which an interstate truck traveled. It found this scheme inefficient and burdensome. See <i>id.,</i> at 39-40. And it enacted a statute setting forth a new system, the Single State Registration System (SSRS), which remains in effect today. Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504. The SSRS allows a trucking company to fill out <i>one</i> set of forms in <i>one</i> State (the base State), and by doing so to register its Federal Permit in <i>every</i> participating State through which its trucks will travel. \u00a7 14504(c); 49 CFR \u00a7 367.4(b) (2004).</p>\n<p>The SSRS statute says that the base State can demand: (1) proof of the trucking company's possession of a Federal Permit, (2) proof of insurance, (3) the name of an agent designated to receive \"service of process,\" and (4) a total fee (charged for the filing of the proof of insurance) equal to the sum of the individual state fees. 49 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 14504(c)(2)(A)(i)-(iv); 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 367.4(c)(1)-(4) (2004). Each individual state fee, it adds, cannot exceed the amount the State charged under the \"bingo card\" system, and in no event can it exceed $10 per truck. 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III). After a truck owner registers, base state officials provide the owner with a receipt to be kept in the cab <span class=\"star-pagination\">*444</span> of each registered truck. 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 367.5(a), (b), (e) (2004). The base State distributes to each participating State its share of the total registration fee. \u00a7 367.6(a).</p>\n<p>The SSRS statute specifies that a State may not impose any additional \"registration requirement.\" It states specifically, in the statutory sentence at issue here, that when a State Registration requirement imposes further obligations, \"the part in excess is an unreasonable burden.\" 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b). It adds that a State may not require \"decals, stamps, cab cards, or any other means of registering . . . specific vehicles.\" \u00a7 14504(c)(2)(B)(iii). And it provides that the \"charging or collection of any fee under this section that is not in accordance with the fee system established [in this provision] shall be deemed to be a burden on interstate commerce.\" \u00a7 14504(c)(2)(C). At the same time, the statute makes clear that a State that complies with the SSRS system need not fear Commerce Clause attack, for it says that a state requirement that an interstate truck \"must register with the State\" is \"not an unreasonable burden on transportation,\" provided that \"the State registration is completed\" in accordance with the SSRS statute. \u00a7 14504(b).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The state law at issue here, \u00a7 478.2(2) of the Michigan Motor Carrier Act, reads as follows:</p>\n<p>\"A motor carrier licensed in this state shall pay an annual fee of $100.00 for each vehicle operated by the motor carrier which is registered in this state [<i>i. e.,</i> which has a Michigan license plate] and operating entirely in interstate commerce.\"</p>\n<p>Related state rules and regulations require a carrier paying the $100 fee to identify each interstate truck by make, type, year, serial number, and unit number. See Equipment List Form P-344-T, App. to Defendant's Response to Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Disposition in No. 95-15628-CM etc. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*445</span> (Mich. Ct. Cl.) (hereinafter Equipment List Form P-344-T). They also make clear that, upon payment of the fee, the carrier will receive a decal that must be affixed to the truck. App. 24 (Affidavit of Pub. Serv. Comm'n. official Thomas R. Lonergan). And they provide that a carrier who pays this fee need not pay the $10 SSRS registration fee if the carrier chooses Michigan as its SSRS base State. See, <i>e. g., id.,</i> at 67, n.; <i>Westlake Transp., Inc.</i> v. <i>Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm'n,</i> 255 Mich. App. 589, 603-604, n. 6, 662 N. W. 2d 784, 790-792, n. 6 (2003); Reply Brief for Petitioners 14-15, n. 8.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Petitioners are interstate trucking companies with trucks that bear Michigan license plates and operate entirely in interstate commerce. Hence they are subject to Michigan's $100 fee. MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) (West 2002). They asked a Michigan court to invalidate \u00a7 478.2(2) as pre-empted by the federal SSRS statute. 255 Mich. App., at 592, 662 N. W. 2d, at 789-790. The Michigan Court of Claims rejected their claim. <i>Id.,</i> at 593-594, 662 N. W. 2d, at 789-790. And the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed. <i>Id.,</i> at 604, 662 N. W. 2d, at 795.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals wrote that the $100 fee is a \"regulatory fee\" \u0097 a \"fee imposed for the administration\" of the State's Motor Carrier Act and for enforcement of Michigan \"safety regulations.\" <i>Ibid.</i> As such, it falls outside the scope of the term \"registration requirement\" as used in the federal SSRS statute, 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b). 255 Mich. App., at 604, 662 N. W. 2d, at 795. The federal statute, according to the Michigan court, consequently does not pre-empt it. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Petitioners sought leave to appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court; leave was denied. <i>Westlake Transp., Inc.</i> v. <i>Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm'n,</i> 469 Mich. 976, 673 N. W. 2d 752 (2003). We granted their petition for certiorari and consolidated the case with <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</i> v. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*446</span> <i>Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm'n, ante,</i> p. 429, a case in which interstate truckers sought review of a separate Michigan fee. We now affirm the Michigan court's judgment in this case, though for other reasons.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The first legal question before us concerns the meaning of the federal statutory words \"State registration requirement.\" They appear in a subsection that reads in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The requirement of a State that a motor carrier, providing [interstate transportation] in that State, must register with the State is not an unreasonable burden on transportation . . . when the State registration is completed under standards of the Secretary [of Transportation] under subsection (c). When a <i>State registration requirement</i> imposes obligations in excess of the standards of the Secretary, the part in excess is an unreasonable burden.\" 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>What is the scope of the italicized words?</p>\n<p>Petitioners ask us to give these words a broad interpretation, sweeping within their ambit every state requirement involving some form of individualized registration that affects an interstate motor carrier. Brief for Petitioners 15 (federal statute's limits apply \"to <i>all</i> interstate motor carriers compelled to register their operations with <i>any</i> State regulatory commission under any State law\" (emphasis in original)). The United States argues for a somewhat narrower interpretation, submitting that the words apply to \"state registration requirements that are imposed on interstate carriers <i>by reason of</i> their operation in interstate commerce.\" Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 19-20 (emphasis in original). In our view, however, the language, read in context, is yet more narrow.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*447</span> Reference to text, historical context, and purpose discloses that the words \"State registration requirement\" do not apply to <i>every</i> State Registration requirement that happens to cover interstate carriers, nor to <i>every</i> such requirement specifically focused on a trucking operation's interstate character. Rather, they apply only to those state requirements that concern <i>SSRS</i> <i>registration</i> \u0097 that is, registration with a State of evidence that a carrier possesses a Federal Permit, registration of proof of insurance, or registration of the name of an agent \"for service of process.\" \u00a7 14504(c)(2)(A)(iv). Thus, the federal provision pre-empts only those state requirements that (1) concern the subject matter of the SSRS and (2) are \"in excess\" of the requirements that the SSRS imposes in respect to that subject matter. See \u00a7 14504(b).</p>\n<p>To begin with, statutory language makes clear that the federal provision reaches no further. Section 14504(b)'s first sentence says that a state \"requirement\" that an interstate motor carrier must \"register with the State is not an unreasonable burden . . . when the State registration is completed under standards of the Secretary under subsection (c).\" <i>Ibid.</i> It is clear from the text as a whole that \"State registration\" cannot cover <i>all</i> registration requirements, but only some. Cf. <i>post,</i> at 464-465 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). The first sentence's reference to the \"standards of the Secretary\" (as well as the focus of the entire statute) tells us which. Those \"standards,\" set forth in subsection (c) \u0097 which is titled \"Single State Registration System\" \u0097 exclusively relate to State Registration of \"evidence of\" a Federal Permit, \"proof of\" insurance, and the \"name of a local agent for service of process,\" and state fees \"for the filing of proof of insurance.\" \u00a7\u00a7 14504(c)(2)(A)(i)-(iv); \u00a7 14504(c)(2)(B)(iv). And the rest of the statute similarly deals exclusively with SSRS matters. See \u00a7 14504(a) (\"standards\" mean \"the specification of forms and procedures required\" to prove that a motor carrier is in compliance with federal requirements). Thus, the words \"State registration\" in the pre-emption provision's first sentence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*448</span> refer only to state systems that seek evidence that a trucker has complied with specific, federally enumerated, <i>SSRS</i> obligations. Cf. 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 13908(d) (\u00a7 14504's fees relate specifically to state efforts to obtain proof of insurance under the SSRS); \u00a7\u00a7 13908(b)(2)-(3) (indicating that \u00a7 14504 refers to state requirements having this purpose).</p>\n<p>How could the same words in the second sentence refer to something totally different? We have found no language here or elsewhere in the statute (which we reproduce in the Appendix, <i>infra</i>) suggesting that the term \"State registration requirement\" in sentence two refers to all State Registration requirements \"imposed on interstate carriers <i>by reason of</i> their operation in interstate commerce.\" Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 20 (emphasis in original). Indeed, to read the words \"by reason of . . .\" into \u00a7 14504, a linguistic stretch, would be wholly inconsistent with the statute's basic purposes, because it would leave a State free to implement a regulation in excess of specific SSRS limitations as long as it did not single out interstate carriers (say, a neutral rule that all truckers must pay $50, or $500, per truck for proof of insurance, or must designate multiple agents for service of process). See <i>post,</i> at 463 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>To avoid this severely incongruous result, the dissent (which adopts the Government's view) must resort to interpretive acrobatics. After first reading subsection (b) to say that a neutral base state requirement, despite being \"in excess\" of SSRS standards, is not an \"unreasonable burden on\" commerce, it then reads subsection (c) to say that such a requirement, <i>because</i> it is \"in excess\" of SSRS standards, is nonetheless prohibited by the statute (in effect, an unreasonable burden on commerce). <i>Post,</i> at 466-468. Aside from imposing significant complexities on the statute where otherwise none would exist, this reading stretches subsection (c)'s function beyond that which its structure and language will allow.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*449</span> Similarly, we see no language elsewhere in the statute suggesting that the term \"State registration requirement\" refers to <i>any</i> kind of State Registration whatsoever that might affect interstate carriers. And even the Government concedes that certain registration obligations \u0097 those in \"traditional areas of state regulation\" \u0097 are beyond the pre-emptive reach of the statute. Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 19. Finally, the implementing regulations do not support these broader constructions. See 49 CFR \u00a7 367.1 <i>et seq.</i> (2004).</p>\n<p>Our reading of the text finds confirmation in historical context. Congress enacted \u00a7 14504 to simplify the old \"bingo card\" system. See <i>Yellow Transp.,</i> 537 U. S., at 39-40. Under the \"bingo card\" scheme, <i>each</i> State could independently demand the same separate filings (evidence of a Federal Permit, proof of insurance, and a service-of-process agent) as well as separate fees. 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 302(b)(2) (1976 ed.); \u00a7 11506 (1988 ed.); 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 1023.11, 1023.21, 1023.32, 1023.51 (1990). Federal law governing that scheme placed no express constraints on any state filings or fees other than those concerning Federal Permit and insurance requirements. Indeed, federal regulations specified that the federal \"bingo card\" statute did not \"affect\" the \"collection or [the] method of collection of taxes or fees by a State\" from interstate truckers \"for the operation of vehicles within\" its \"borders.\" \u00a7 1023.104. And they further provided that the statute did not \"affect\" state requirements \"as to the external identification of vehicles to indicate the payment of a State tax or fee imposed for revenue purposes or for any other purpose\" not governed by the \"bingo card\" system. \u00a7 1023.42.</p>\n<p>When Congress created the new SSRS, it did not indicate (in the text, structure, or divinable purpose of the new provision) that the pre-emptive scope of the new scheme would be any broader than that of the old. See ISTEA, 105 Stat. 1914. The relevant differences between the SSRS and the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*450</span> \"bingo card\" regime were that: (1) one State, rather than many, would collect the relevant filings; (2) one State, rather than many, would collect the relevant fees; and (3) these fees, limited to the same amount as before, would relate to filing of proof of insurance rather than to filing of the Federal Permit. Compare 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 11506 (1988 ed.) with \u00a7 14504 (2000 ed.); see also \u00a7 11506 (1988 ed., Supp. IV). These modifications merely sought more efficient, not greater, federal regulation. See <i>Yellow Transp., supra</i><i>;</i> see also 49 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 13908(a), (d) (authorizing the Secretary to replace the SSRS with a yet more streamlined system and pre-empting only those State \"insurance filing requirements or fees that <i>are for the same purposes</i> as filings or fees the Secretary requires under the new system\" (emphasis added)). And while the new regulations implementing the SSRS do not explicitly exempt unrelated state requirements from the statute's pre-emptive reach, neither they nor the rulemaking that produced them suggest any change to pre-existing practice in this respect. See 49 CFR \u00a7 367.1 <i>et seq.</i> (2004); see also <i>Single State Insurance Registration,</i> 9 I. C. C. 2d 610 (1993) (Interstate Commerce Commission decision announcing new regulations); <i>Single State Insurance Registration,</i> No. MC-100 (Sub-No. 6), 1993 WL 17833 (I. C. C., Jan. 13, 1993) (proposing regulations, providing justifications, and soliciting further comments).</p>\n<p>Finally, we have found nothing in the statute's basic purposes or objectives \u0097 improving the efficiency of the \"bingo card\" system and simplifying a uniform scheme for providing States with certain vital information \u0097 that either requires a broader reading of the statutory term, or that impliedly pre-empts other, non-SSRS-related state rules. Cf. <i>Geier</i> v. <i>American Honda Motor Co.,</i> 529 U. S. 861, 881 (2000) (federal statutes by implication pre-empt state law that stands \"as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution\" of their federal objectives (internal quotation marks omitted)). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*451</span> That is, we can find no indication that Congress sought to use this narrowly focused statute to forbid state fee or registration obligations that have nothing to do with basic SSRS (or earlier \"bingo card\") objectives \u0097 say, for example, a State Registration requirement related to compliance by interstate carriers with rules governing the introduction of foreign pests into the jurisdiction, or with a State's version of the Amber Alert system, or with size, weight, and safety standards. The Constitution's Commerce Clause may (or may not) forbid some such rules. But this statute \u0097 which identifies and regulates very specific items \u0097 says nothing about them, and there is no reason to believe that Congress wished to resolve <i>that</i> kind of Commerce Clause issue in this provision. Cf. 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 13908 (indicating that the SSRS may well be only a temporary system and similarly focusing on limited, federally enumerated requirements without discussing broad pre-emption).</p>\n<p>We conclude, as we have said, that the term \"State registration requirement,\" as used in the second sentence of the SSRS statute, covers only those State Registration requirements that concern the subject matter of that statutory provision, namely, the registration of a Federal Permit, proof of insurance, and the name of an agent for service of process. See <i>supra,</i> at 446-447. It neither explicitly nor implicitly reaches unrelated matters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The second legal question involves the Michigan statute imposing the $100 fee on Michigan-plated trucks operating entirely in interstate commerce. MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) (West 2002). Do the requirements set forth in that statute concern the SSRS statute's subject matter? We think that they do not.</p>\n<p>For one thing, the Michigan statute imposing the $100 fee makes no reference to evidence of a Federal Permit, to any insurance requirement, or to an agent for receiving service <span class=\"star-pagination\">*452</span> of process. Nor, as far as we can tell, do any state rules related to the $100 fee require the filing of information about these matters. See Equipment List Form P-344-T (requiring information about truck make, type, year, unit number, and serial number).</p>\n<p>For another thing, Michigan law imposed a separate fee on interstate motor carriers with trucks license plated in Michigan before the SSRS existed and before Michigan began to participate in the \"bingo card\" system. See App. 24-25; Plaintiffs' Second Motion for Partial Summary Disposition in No. 95-15628-CM etc. (Mich. Ct. Cl.), p. 5; Plaintiffs-Appellants' Brief on Appeal, in No. 226052 etc. (Mich. Ct. App.), pp. 5-6; MCL \u00a7 478.7(4) (West 2002). Hence such a fee does not represent an effort somehow to circumvent the limitations imposed in connection with federal laws governing State Registration of Federal Permits.</p>\n<p>Finally, Michigan rules provide that a Michigan-plated interstate truck choosing Michigan as its SSRS base State can apparently comply with Michigan's SSRS requirements even if it does not comply with Michigan's $100 fee requirement. The owner of that truck can fill out Michigan form RS-1, thereby providing Michigan with evidence that it has a Federal Permit. App. 65-66. It can also fill out form RS-2, on which it indicates the total SSRS fees it owes to all participating States whose borders the truck will cross. <i>Id.,</i> at 67. Upon submission of the two forms and payment of the fees, Michigan apparently will give the owner form RS-3, an SSRS receipt, a copy of which the owner can place in the vehicle of the truck, thereby complying with Michigan's (and all other participating States') SSRS-related \"State registration requirements.\" If that owner fails to pay Michigan's $100 fee for that truck, the owner will not receive a state fee decal. But that owner will have violated only Michigan's $100 fee statute here at issue, MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) (West 2002). Petitioners have provided us with nothing that suggests the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*453</span> owner will have violated any other provision of Michigan law. See \u00a7 478.7(4). And they have not demonstrated that Michigan law in practice holds hostage a truck owner's SSRS compliance until the owner pays \u00a7 478.2(2)'s $100 fee.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, we recognize that Michigan form RS-2, the form that lists all SSRS-participating States together with their SSRS-related fees, places an asterisk next to Michigan and states that \"[v]ehicles base-plated in Michigan need not\" pay any SSRS fee but \"are required to have a $100.00\" Michigan decal. App. 67. Michigan thereby forgives Michigan-plated interstate trucks (which must pay Michigan $100) payment of the $10 Michigan SSRS fee that would otherwise be due. And to that extent, there is a connection between the $100 fee and the SSRS.</p>\n<p>Michigan appears to forgive its $10 SSRS fee, however, only for the Michigan-plated interstate trucks of a carrier that has chosen Michigan as its SSRS \"base\" State. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 14-15, n. 8. Michigan-plated trucks operating out of a different SSRS base State, say, Ohio, must pay the fee, which is remitted back to Michigan. Thus, the $10 reduction can be seen simply as an effort to provide modest, administratively efficient (because Michigan itself is handling both fees) recompense to those motor carriers that operate Michigan-plated trucks and choose Michigan as their SSRS base State. That subsidiary connection cannot transform Michigan's $100 fee, which exclusively involves non-SSRS subject matter (and was created for non-SSRS-related reasons), into a requirement that concerns the subject matter of the SSRS statute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, we conclude that 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b) does not pre-empt Michigan's $100 fee. The judgment of the Michigan Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*454</span> APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT</h2>\n<p>Title 49 U.

Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 478.2(2) (West 2002) (hereinafter MCL) is not a registration requirement. <i>Westlake Transp., Inc.</i> v. <i>Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm'n,</i> 255 Mich. App. 589, 603-605, 662 N.W.2d 784, 795 (2003). Our Court, too, errs by concluding that the term \"State registration requirement\" in 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b) includes only those state registration requirements that \"concern the [same] subject matter\" as the Single State Registration System (SSRS) established by \u00a7 14504(c). <i>Ante,</i> at 447, 451. This respectful dissent explains my reasons for rejecting these two holdings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*457</span> I</h2>\n<p>Title 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14504(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The requirement of a State that a motor carrier, providing [interstate transportation] in that State, must register with the State is not an unreasonable burden on transportation . . . when the State registration is completed under standards of the Secretary [of Transportation] under [\u00a7 14504(c)]. When a State registration requirement imposes obligations in excess of the standards of the Secretary, the part in excess is an unreasonable burden.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The dispositive question in the instant case is whether MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) is a \"State registration requirement\" within the meaning of the second sentence of 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b). The Michigan Court of Appeals said the answer is no because MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) is not a registration requirement at all. The Court also says the answer is no, but for a different reason. It concludes that, even though \u00a7 478.2(2) is a registration requirement, the term \"registration requirement\" in 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b) includes only the subset of registration requirements that concern the same subject matter as the SSRS. Neither the Court's reason, nor the different reason given by the Michigan Court of Appeals, is persuasive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Michigan Court of Appeals adopted a categorical rule: \"If the purpose of a fee is to regulate an industry or service, it can be properly classified as a regulatory fee,\" not a registration fee. 255 Mich. App., at 605, 662 N. W. 2d, at 795. Proceeding to apply the rule so announced, the Court of Appeals held that the $100 fee imposed by MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) on Michigan-plated interstate carriers is a regulatory fee rather than a registration fee because the fee is \"imposed for the administration of the [Michigan Motor Carrier Act], particularly covering costs of enforcing safety regulations.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 604, 662 N. W. 2d, at 795.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*458</span> The majority affirms the judgment below, but \"for other reasons.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 446. The Court's reluctance to adopt the Michigan Court of Appeals' rationale is understandable. MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) and related state rules and regulations require a motor carrier that wants to operate Michigan-plated vehicles in interstate commerce in Michigan to fill out a form providing detailed identifying information for each vehicle and to pay a $100-per-vehicle fee. In return, the State provides the carrier with decals that it must place on its trucks. See <i>ante,</i> at 444-445. If this is not a \"State registration requirement\" in the general and ordinary sense of the term, it is hard to conceive of what is.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals' holding would allow the State to convert any registration fee into a regulatory fee simply by declaring a regulatory purpose or spending some portion of the money collected on regulation or administration. The logic of this approach excludes from the coverage of 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b) almost all state requirements, including those dealing with similar subject matter as the SSRS. The purpose of SSRS requirements, after all, is to regulate the interstate motor carrier industry; and the fees collected are used to administer the system. The Court's disapproval of the Michigan Court of Appeals' reasoning is implicit in the Court's decision to affirm on a different ground. <i>Ante,</i> at 446. Yet the Court's affirmance of the Court of Appeals' decision, coupled with the Court's failure to make its apparent disagreement with the reasoning explicit, will result in the Michigan Court of Appeals' broad rule surviving to work additional mischief in future cases, a most undesirable result in this area, where fees and regulatory requirements are so pervasive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>Although the Court appears to agree that MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) imposes a state registration requirement on interstate motor carriers, it holds, nonetheless, that the provision is not pre-empted by 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b). This, according to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*459</span> Court, is because the phrase \"State registration requirement\" in \u00a7 14504(b) refers not to state registration requirements generally, but only to those state registration requirements that concern the same subject matter as the SSRS: registration of a federal permit, proof of insurance, and designation of an agent for service of process. <i>Ante,</i> at 451. Section 14504(b) simply cannot bear the narrowing construction the Court seeks to impose upon it.</p>\n<p>The first sentence of \u00a7 14504(b) authorizes States to impose registration requirements on interstate motor carriers if the registration \"is completed under standards of the Secretary under [\u00a7 14504(c)],\" <i>i. e.,</i> under the SSRS. The second sentence of \u00a7 14504(b) pre-empts \"a State registration requirement\" that imposes \"obligations in excess\" of the SSRS. There ought to be no question that MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) is a state registration requirement. The Court seems to agree, at least when the phrase \"State registration requirement\" is used in its ordinary and general sense. It should also be apparent that the obligations imposed by \u00a7 478.2(2) are in excess of those authorized by the standards of the Secretary under 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(c). The plain text of \u00a7 14504(b), then, would appear to pre-empt MCL \u00a7 478.2(2), at least when \u00a7 478.2(2) is considered in isolation.</p>\n<p>The Court, however, departs from the text of the statute. Title 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b), by its terms, saves from pre-emption only one class of state registration requirements imposed on interstate motor carriers: those completed under standards of the Secretary under \u00a7 14504(c), <i>i. e.,</i> those that are authorized under the SSRS. To this subset the Court adds a second class of state registration requirements saved from pre-emption: those that concern subject matters not covered under \u00a7 14504(c). The problem, of course, is that the statute simply does not provide for the exemption the Court invents. There is no basis in the statutory text or structure for adding this limitation, and the Court cannot carry its heavy burden to show why the language Congress used in \u00a7 14504(b) should not be given its ordinary meaning.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*460</span> 2</h2>\n<p>The Court makes only one textual argument for the limitation it superimposes on \u00a7 14504(b)'s second sentence. The second sentence, the Court reasons, refers to the same set of state registration requirements discussed in the first sentence. It must follow, the Court says, that because the first sentence of \u00a7 14504(b) refers to SSRS registration, the phrase \"State registration requirement\" in the second sentence refers only to state registration requirements that concern the same subject matter as the SSRS. <i>Ante,</i> at 447-448.</p>\n<p>The Court's premise is faulty. The two terms in the first sentence \u0097 \"requirement of a State that [an interstate motor carrier] must register\" and \"registration requirement\" \u0097 are not, when taken by themselves, limited to state registration requirements concerning the same \"subject matter\" as the SSRS. These terms, like the term \"State registration requirement\" in the second sentence of \u00a7 14504(b), refer generally to any state requirement that an interstate motor carrier register with the State. No narrower reading is necessary to make perfect sense of each of \u00a7 14504(b)'s two sentences and of how they operate together. The first sentence of \u00a7 14504(b) declares that the subset of state registration requirements consisting of those requirements authorized under the SSRS \u0097 <i>i. e.,</i> requirements \"completed under standards of the Secretary under [\u00a7 14504(c)]\" \u0097 are not pre-empted. The second sentence of \u00a7 14504(b) says that all other state registration requirements for interstate motor carriers are pre-empted. It is difficult to understand the Court's mighty struggle to resist this simple, direct reading of the statutory language.</p>\n<p>The Court also observes that there is no language elsewhere in the statute or in the implementing regulations suggesting that \"State registration requirement\" in \u00a7 14504(b) refers to all types of state registration requirements imposed on interstate motor carriers, and the Court asserts that even <span class=\"star-pagination\">*461</span> the United States concedes that certain registration obligations in traditional areas of state regulation are beyond the statute's pre-emptive reach. <i>Ante,</i> at 449. The first claim is irrelevant and the second is wrong. Section 14504(b) itself makes clear its pre-emptive scope, and confirmation by other statutory provisions or administrative regulations is unnecessary. And, while the United States did say that \u00a7 14504(b) was not \"intended to preempt state laws and fees in traditional areas of state regulation,\" the reason the United States believes this is so is because \u00a7 14054(b) does not pre-empt general registration requirements that do not apply specifically to interstate motor carriers. Brief as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 19-20.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3</h2>\n<p>Perhaps sensing the weakness of its textual argument, the Court turns to statutory history. The Court is correct to say that, before the enactment of \u00a7 14504(b) and the SSRS, federal law did not pre-empt state filings or fees other than those concerning federal permit and insurance requirements. <i>Ante,</i> at 449. Pre-SSRS federal regulations, furthermore, specified that the federal statute did not affect the power of States to collect other fees from interstate motor carriers or to require decals indicating payment of these fees. <i>Ibid.</i> This is beside the point, however. The extent of pre-emption before enactment of \u00a7 14504(b) tells us little about \u00a7 14504(b)'s pre-emptive effect. Similarly, the fact that pre-SSRS federal regulations preserved other state registration requirements is of minimal significance when, as the Court admits, the new regulations contain no such provisions. <i>Ante,</i> at 450. If anything, the failure to repromulgate regulations saving other state registration fees from pre-emption suggests that the federal agency charged with implementing the SSRS did think that \u00a7 14504(b) expanded the scope of federal pre-emption.</p>\n<p>The Court's meaning is therefore obscure when it declares that Congress \"did not indicate (in the text, structure, or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*462</span> divinable purpose of the new provision) that the pre-emptive scope of the new scheme would be any broader than that of the old.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 449. Congress did indicate an expansion of federal pre-emption in \u00a7 14504(b)'s \"text\" and \"structure\" \u0097 it did so by replacing a narrow pre-emption clause with a broad pre-emption clause. Congress is not required to say, \"We really mean it.\" Cf. <i>Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc.</i> v. <i>Nigh,</i> 543 U. S. 50, 73 (2004) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (\"I hardly think it `scant indication' of intent to alter [the meaning of a statute] that Congress <i>amended the text of the statute</i>\" (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p>Perhaps the Court means to suggest that what appears to be the plain meaning of \u00a7 14504(b) is put in doubt by the fact that the predecessor statute's pre-emptive scope was much more limited. Comparison with predecessor statutes, however, is permissible only to resolve statutory ambiguity that exists independent of the comparison with the predecessor statute; comparison with predecessor statutes cannot be used to create ambiguity about the meaning of an otherwise clear statute. <i>Lamie</i> v. <i>United States Trustee,</i> 540 U. S. 526, 533-535 (2004); see also <i>Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc.,</i> 543 U. S., at 66-67 (KENNEDY, J., concurring); <i>id.,</i> at 67 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment); <i>id.,</i> at 73 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4</h2>\n<p>The Court's final reason for imposing its narrowing construction on \u00a7 14504(b) is that the Court has found \"nothing in the statute's basic purposes . . . that . . . requires a broader reading of the statutory term . . . .\" <i>Ante,</i> at 450. In the Court's view the only purpose of \u00a7 14504 is to make minor improvements in the efficiency of the old bingo card system. <i>Ante,</i> at 449-450. The Court makes no convincing argument that \u00a7 14504(b)'s purpose was so limited. The Court, furthermore, does not explain why the statute's basic purposes require the Court's artificially narrow reading of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*463</span> facially broad statutory command. The most the Court is willing to say is that it \"can find no indication,\" <i>ante,</i> at 451, that when Congress said \"State registration requirement,\" it meant \"State registration requirement.\" So it says Congress must have meant \"State registration requirement concerning the same subject matter as the SSRS.\" The text of \u00a7 14504(b), however, does not admit of the qualifications the Court adds to it. The Court's argument from statutory purpose has no basis.</p>\n<p>The Court suggests that if Congress intended \u00a7 14504(b) to have the broad pre-emptive effect required by the text, Congress would have more clearly indicated that intention. <i>Ibid.</i> (\"[W]e can find no indication that Congress sought\" to pre-empt requirements not related to SSRS subject matter). It is not entirely clear what sort of additional indication of congressional purpose the Court is looking for. The text, as noted above, does provide an indication of Congress' intent. Perhaps the Court is troubled by the absence of statements in the legislative history endorsing \u00a7 14504(b)'s expansion of federal pre-emption. The lack of confirmatory legislative history, however, is not a legitimate reason for imposing an artificial narrowing construction on broad but clear statutory text. \"[I]t would be a strange canon of statutory construction that would require Congress to state in committee reports or elsewhere in its deliberations that which is obvious on the face of a statute.\" <i>Harrison</i> v. <i>PPG Industries, Inc.,</i> 446 U. S. 578, 592 (1980). See also <i>Morales</i> v. <i>Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</i> 504 U. S. 374, 385, n. 2 (1992) (\"[L]egislative history need not confirm the details of changes in the law effected by statutory language before we will interpret that language according to its natural meaning\"); <i>Chisom</i> v. <i>Roemer,</i> 501 U. S. 380, 406 (1991) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (\"We are here to apply the statute, not legislative history, and certainly not the absence of legislative history\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*464</span> II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In my submission, the phrase \"State registration requirement\" in \u00a7 14504(b) cannot be read as limited to state registration requirements that concern one particular subject matter. It should be noted, however, that this phrase is ambiguous in a different respect. Section 14504(b) might be read, on the one hand, to exempt interstate motor carriers from any non-SSRS state registration requirement, including general requirements that apply to all motor carriers or to some other set of entities. On the other hand, \u00a7 14504(b) might be read to pre-empt only those non-SSRS registration requirements that apply specifically to interstate motor carriers. That is, \u00a7 14504(b) might come into play only if being an interstate motor carrier is a necessary or sufficient condition for imposition of a state registration requirement. The United States takes the latter view of the statute, Brief as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 17-22, and I am of the same opinion.</p>\n<p>Though the phrase \"State registration requirement\" in the second sentence of \u00a7 14504(b) is not qualified, it is clear from context that this term refers to a \"requirement of a State that a motor carrier, providing [interstate transportation] must register with the State,\" the more specific term that appears in \u00a7 14509(b)'s first sentence. It is grammatically possible to read the statutory command as exempting interstate motor carriers from all registration requirements other than the SSRS, but that reading would lead to absurd results. It would suggest, for example, that interstate motor carriers with a principal place of business in Michigan do not have to register their presence for purposes of state tax collection. In context, the more natural and sensible reading of the phrase \"requirement of a State that a motor carrier, providing [interstate transportation] must register with the State\" includes only those registration requirements that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*465</span> are triggered specifically by the fact that the entity in question is an interstate motor carrier.</p>\n<p>Because \u00a7 14504(b) pre-empts state registration requirements that single out interstate carriers, but not general state registration requirements that apply to interstate carriers only incidentally, my analysis of \u00a7 14504(b) does not necessarily mean the Court's ultimate conclusion in this case is incorrect. Respondents contend that MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) applies only to trucks with Michigan license plates, and that \u00a7 478.2(2) should be considered together with \u00a7 478.2(1), which imposes a $100 fee on every truck doing intrastate business within Michigan. According to respondents, then, 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b) does not come into play because interstate carriers are not singled out; Michigan imposes the same $100 fee on all for-hire motor vehicles license plated in Michigan. Brief for Respondents 44-45. Petitioners and the United States take issue with this argument. Reply Brief for Petitioners 10-14; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 24-29.</p>\n<p>In my view it is not necessary to reach this question. The Michigan Court of Appeals resolved the case on the incorrect theory that a fee is not a registration fee if its purpose is to regulate the industry. Given its erroneous view of the statute, the proper course should be to vacate the Court of Appeals' decision and remand for further proceedings. Remanding the case would allow the Michigan courts to consider the competing arguments in light of the correct legal interpretation of 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b). Respondents would, at that stage, be able to advance their arguments that MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) is not pre-empted when it is considered in conjunction with \u00a7 478.2(1) or any other aspect of the statutory scheme that bears on whether Michigan imposes registration requirements specifically on interstate motor carriers beyond those authorized under the SSRS.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*466</span> B</h2>\n<p>The Court insists that to read \"requirement that a motor carrier providing [interstate transportation] must register with the State\" as including only those requirements that apply specifically to interstate motor carriers would be \"wholly inconsistent with the statute's basic purposes, because it would leave a State free to implement a regulation in excess of specific SSRS limitations as long as it did not single out interstate carriers. . . .\" <i>Ante,</i> at 448. The Court is correct that, under my interpretation, 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b) would not pre-empt general, neutral requirements, even if they dealt with subject matter similar to that covered by the SSRS. The Court is wrong, however, to suggest this therefore means an SSRS could collect from interstate motor carriers a $500 fee for proof of insurance or require designation of multiple agents for service of process, as long as the requirement in question applied evenhandedly to all motor carriers. The Court errs because it fails to give adequate consideration to the restrictions imposed by \u00a7 14504(c).</p>\n<p>Section 14504(c)(2)(A) declares that \"only a State acting in its capacity as [a] registration State under [the SSRS] may require a motor carrier registered by the Secretary under [the SSRS]\" to file proof of federal registration and proof of insurance, to collect fees for filing proof of insurance, and to maintain a local agent for service of process. Section 14504(c)(2)(B) constrains the SSRS registration requirements and fees the SSRS registration State can impose on interstate motor carriers. These sections contain an ambiguity similar to that which affects \u00a7 14504(b). Context, however, suggests that the ambiguity should be resolved differently. The best interpretation of \u00a7 14504(c), in my submission, is that no State participating in the SSRS other than an interstate motor carrier's designated SSRS registration State may impose requirements of the sort listed in \u00a7 14504(c)(2)(A) on that carrier, even if the requirement is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*467</span> general and applies to all motor carriers. The SSRS registration State, furthermore, may only impose on registered interstate motor carriers requirements related to those listed in \u00a7\u00a7 14504(c)(2)(A)(i)-(iv) if the State conforms to the restrictions in \u00a7 14504(c)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>Taken together, the general pre-emption provision in \u00a7 14504(b) and the specific limitations on SSRS registration States in \u00a7 14504(c) establish a rational regulatory scheme. Whether or not a State participates in the SSRS, it cannot impose a registration requirement that singles out interstate motor carriers unless that requirement is authorized under the SSRS. States that participate in the SSRS may impose general, neutral registration requirements that happen to affect interstate motor carriers unless those requirements are inconsistent with the specific mandates of the SSRS related to proof of insurance, proof of federal permit, fees, and service of process. Non-SSRS States may impose any general, neutral registration requirement, even if they require interstate motor carriers, among others, to file proof of insurance or maintain a local agent for service of process.</p>\n<p>The Court's interpretation leads to a less sensible scheme. According to the Court, that statute permits States to impose on interstate carriers any number of onerous requirements so long as these requirements are not explicitly linked to the subjects covered by the SSRS. The Court's interpretation, furthermore, means that those States which are excluded from the SSRS under \u00a7 14504(c)(2)(D) may not apply general state registration requirements to interstate motor carriers if the requirements concern proof of insurance or registration of an agent for service of process. Under the Court's interpretation, the statute does not pre-empt state regulations that single out interstate carriers for special burdens well beyond what the SSRS allows, but it does prevent non-SSRS States from applying a number of modest, evenhanded registration requirements to interstate carriers, even <span class=\"star-pagination\">*468</span> though the SSRS is not available to these States. That implausible result is not demanded by the statute's basic purposes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Instead of heeding what Congress actually said, the Court relies on flawed textual analysis and dubious inferences from legislative silence to impose the Court's view of what it thinks Congress probably wanted to say. In my view, this is a mistake. Other arguments, not considered by the Michigan Court of Appeals or by our Court, might support the ultimate outcome in this case. These arguments, however, ought to be addressed on remand.</p>\n</div>",

Argued April 26, 2005\u2014Decided June 20, 2005\nFederal law requires most interstate truckers to obtain a permit (Fed-\n  eral Permit) that reflects compliance with certain federal require-\n  ments. The 1965 version of the law authorized States to require\n  proof that a truck operator had such a permit. By 1991, 39 States\n  demanded such proof, requiring a $10 per truck registration fee\n  (State Registration) and giving each trucker a stamp to affix to a\n  multistate \u201cbingo card\u201d carried in the vehicle. Finding this scheme\n  inefficient and burdensome, Congress created the current Single\n  State Registration System (SSRS), which allows a trucking company\n  to fill out one set of forms in one State (base State), thereby register-\n  ing its Federal Permit in every participating State through which its\n  trucks travel. 49 U. S. C. \u00a714504(c). The base State can demand\n  proof of the Federal Permit, proof of insurance, the name of an agent\n  to receive service of process, and a fee equal to the sum of the indi-\n  vidual state fees. \u00a7\u00a714504(c)(2)(A)(i)\u2013(iv). The SSRS prohibits a\n  State from imposing any additional \u201cState registration requirement.\u201d\n  \u00a714504(b). Michigan Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7478.2(2) imposes an annual\n  $100 fee on each Michigan license-plated truck operating entirely in\n  interstate commerce. Petitioner interstate trucking companies sub-\n  ject to \u00a7478.2(2) sought to have it invalidated, but the Michigan\n  Court of Claims refused. The State Court of Appeals affirmed, hold-\n  ing that, because the fee is imposed for the administration of the\n  State\u2019s Motor Carrier Act and for enforcement of state safety regula-\n  tions, it is not a \u201cregistration requirement\u201d pre-empted by \u00a714504(b).\nHeld: Section \u00a714504 does not pre-empt Michigan\u2019s $100 fee. Pp. 5\u201313.\n    (a) Reference to text, historical context, and purpose disclose that\n the words \u201cState registration requirement\u201d in \u00a714504(b)\u2019s second sen-\n tence apply only to those state requirements concerning SSRS regis-\n2       MID-CON FREIGHT SYSTEMS, INC. v. MICHIGAN PUB.\n                       SERV. COMM\u2019N\n                           Syllabus\n\n    tration. Statutory language makes clear that the federal provision\n    reaches no further. The subsection\u2019s first sentence uses the words\n    \u201cState registration\u201d to refer only to state systems seeking evidence\n    that a trucker has complied with the specific SSRS obligations enu-\n    merated in \u00a7\u00a714504(c)(2)(A)(i)\u2013(iv). No language in the second sen-\n    tence suggests that the same words should be given a different,\n    broader meaning there. Nor does any language elsewhere in the\n    statute suggest that \u201cState registration requirement\u201d refers to any\n    kind of State Registration whatsoever that might affect interstate\n    carriers, or to those state requirements imposed by reason of a motor\n    carrier\u2019s operation in interstate commerce. The implementing regu-\n    lations also do not support a broader meaning. Historical context\n    confirms this reading. Congress enacted \u00a714504 to simplify the\n    \u201cbingo card\u201d system, which placed no constraints on any state filings\n    or fees other than those concerning Federal Permit and insurance re-\n    quirements. In creating the SSRS, Congress gave no indication that\n    the pre-emptive scope of the new scheme would be any broader than\n    that of the old. Finally, nothing in the statute\u2019s basic purposes or ob-\n    jectives\u2014improving the \u201cbingo card\u201d system\u2019s efficiency and simplify-\n    ing a uniform scheme for providing States with certain vital informa-\n    tion\u2014either requires a broader reading of the statutory term or\n    impliedly pre-empts non-SSRS-related state rules. Pp. 5\u201311.\n       (b) Section 478.2(2)\u2019s requirements do not concern the SSRS\u2019s sub-\n    ject matter. First, the Michigan statute makes no reference to evi-\n    dence of a Federal Permit, an insurance requirement, or an agent for\n    receiving service of process. Nor do any state rules related to the fee\n    appear to require the filing of information on these matters. In addi-\n    tion, because Michigan imposed its separate fee before the SSRS ex-\n    isted and before it began to participate in the \u201cbingo card\u201d system,\n    the fee does not represent an effort to circumvent the limitations im-\n    posed in connection with federal laws governing State Registration of\n    Federal Permits. Finally, petitioners have failed to show that Michi-\n    gan rules do not allow a Michigan-plated interstate truck choosing\n    Michigan as its base State to comply with the SSRS requirements\n    even if it does not comply with \u00a7478.2(2). The fact that Michigan ap-\n    pears to forgive the State\u2019s $10 SSRS fee for trucks that comply with\n    \u00a7478.2(2) can be seen as an effort to provide a modest, administra-\n    tively efficient recompense to those motor carriers that choose Michi-\n    gan as their base State, but such a subsidiary connection cannot\n    transform the State\u2019s fee into a requirement concerning the SSRS\n    statute\u2019s subject matter.

A Michigan law im-\nposes \u201can annual fee of $100.00\u201d upon each Michigan\nlicense-plated truck that is \u201coperating entirely in inter-\nstate commerce.\u201d Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7478.2(2) (West\n2002) (hereinafter MCL). A federal statute states that \u201ca\nState registration requirement . . . is an unreasonable\nburden\u201d upon interstate commerce when it imposes so\nhigh a fee. 49 U. S. C. \u00a714504(b) (emphasis added); see\nalso \u00a714504(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III). Does this federal statutory\nprovision pre-empt the Michigan law? We conclude that\nthe Michigan fee requirement is not the kind of \u201cState\nregistration requirement\u201d to which the federal statute\nrefers. And for that reason, the statute does not pre-empt\nit.\n                              I\n                             A\n  Federal law has long required most motor carriers doing\ninterstate business to obtain a permit\u2014which we shall call\na Federal Permit\u2014that reflects compliance with certain\n2    MID-CON FREIGHT SYSTEMS, INC. v. MICHIGAN PUB. \n\n                    SERV. COMM\u2019N                           \n\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\nfederal requirements. See 49 U. S. C. \u00a713901 et seq.; 49\nCFR \u00a7365.101 et seq. (2004). In 1965, Congress authorized\nStates to require proof that the operator of an interstate\ntruck had secured a Federal Permit. 49 U. S. C. \u00a7302(b)(2)\n(1976 ed.); see generally Yellow Transp., Inc. v. Michigan,\n537 U. S. 36, 39 (2002). By 1991, 39 States demanded\nsuch proof by requiring some form of what we shall call\nState Registration (of the Federal Permit). Those States\ntypically would require truckers to file with a state agency\nevidence that each interstate truck was covered by a\nFederal Permit. They would require the trucker to pay a\nState Registration fee of up to $10 per truck. And they\nwould issue a State Registration stamp that the trucker\nwould affix to a multistate \u201cbingo card\u201d carried within the\nvehicle. See 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a71023.32, 1023.33 (1990); Yellow\nTransp., 537 U. S., at 39.\n   In 1991, Congress focused upon the fact that the \u201cbingo\ncard\u201d system required a trucking company to obtain a\nseparate stamp from each State through which an inter-\nstate truck traveled. It found this scheme inefficient and\nburdensome. See id., at 39\u201340. And it enacted a statute\nsetting forth a new system, the Single State Registration\nSystem (SSRS), which remains in effect today. Intermodal\nSurface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), 49\nU. S. C. \u00a714504. The SSRS allows a trucking company to\nfill out one set of forms in one State (the base State), and\nby doing so to register its Federal Permit in every partici-\npating State through which its trucks will travel.\n\u00a714504(c); 49 CFR \u00a7367.4(b) (2004).\n   The SSRS statute says that the base State can demand:\n(1) proof of the trucking company\u2019s possession of a Federal\nPermit, (2) proof of insurance, (3) the name of an agent\ndesignated to receive \u201cservice of process,\u201d and (4) a total\nfee (charged for the filing of the proof of insurance) equal\nto the sum of the individual state fees. 49 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a714504(c)(2)(A)(i)\u2013(iv); 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7367.4(c)(1)\u2013(4) (2004).\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nEach individual state fee, it adds, cannot exceed the\namount the State charged under the \u201cbingo card\u201d system,\nand in no event can it exceed $10 per truck. 49 U. S. C.\n\u00a714504(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III). After a truck owner registers,\nbase state officials provide the owner with a receipt to be\nkept in the cab of each registered truck.             49 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a7367.5(a), (b), (e) (2004). The base State distributes to\neach participating State its share of the total registration\nfee. \u00a7367.6(a).\n   The SSRS statute specifies that a State may not impose\nany additional \u201cregistration requirement.\u201d It states spe-\ncifically, in the statutory sentence at issue here, that when\na State Registration requirement imposes further obliga-\ntions, \u201cthe part in excess is an unreasonable burden.\u201d 49\nU. S. C. \u00a714504(b). It adds that a State may not require\n\u201cdecals, stamps, cab cards, or any other means of register-\ning . . . specific vehicles.\u201d \u00a714504(c)(2)(B)(iii). And it\nprovides that the \u201ccharging or collection of any fee under\nthis section that is not in accordance with the fee system\nestablished [in this provision] shall be deemed to be a\nburden on interstate commerce.\u201d \u00a714504(c)(2)(C). At the\nsame time, the statute makes clear that a State that\ncomplies with the SSRS system need not fear Commerce\nClause attack, for it says that a state requirement that an\ninterstate truck \u201cmust register with the State\u201d is \u201cnot an\nunreasonable burden on transportation,\u201d provided that\n\u201cthe State registration is completed\u201d in accordance with\nthe SSRS statute. \u00a714504(b).\n                             B\n The state law at issue here, \u00a7478.2(2) of the Michigan\nMotor Carrier Act, reads as follows:\n    \u201cA motor carrier licensed in this state shall pay an\n    annual fee of $100.00 for each vehicle operated by the\n    motor carrier which is registered in this state [i.e.,\n    which has a Michigan license plate] and operating en-\n4    MID-CON FREIGHT SYSTEMS, INC. v.

And they provide that a carrier\nwho pays this fee need not pay the $10 SSRS registration\nfee if the carrier chooses Michigan as its SSRS base State.\nSee, e.g., id., at 67, n.; Westlake Transp., Inc. v.

The United States argues for a\nsomewhat narrower interpretation, submitting that the\nwords apply to \u201cstate registration requirements that are\nimposed on interstate carriers by reason of their operation\nin interstate commerce.\u201d Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 19\u201320 (emphasis in original). In our view,\nhowever, the language, read in context, is yet more\nnarrow.\n   Reference to text, historical context, and purpose dis-\ncloses that the words \u201cState registration requirement\u201d do\nnot apply to every State Registration requirement that\nhappens to cover interstate carriers, nor to every such\nrequirement specifically focused on a trucking operation\u2019s\ninterstate character. Rather, they apply only to those\nstate requirements that concern SSRS registration\u2014that\nis, registration with a State of evidence that a carrier\npossesses a Federal Permit, registration of proof of insur-\nance, or registration of the name of an agent \u201cfor service of\nprocess.\u201d \u00a714504(c)(2)(A)(iv). Thus, the federal provision\npre-empts only those state requirements that (1) concern\nthe subject matter of the SSRS and (2) are \u201cin excess\u201d of\nthe requirements that the SSRS imposes in respect to that\nsubject matter. See \u00a714504(b).\n   To begin with, statutory language makes clear that the\nfederal provision reaches no further. Section 14504(b)\u2019s\nfirst sentence says that a state \u201crequirement\u201d that an\ninterstate motor carrier must \u201cregister with the State is\nnot an unreasonable burden . . . when the State registra-\ntion is completed under standards of the Secretary under\nsubsection (c).\u201d Ibid. It is clear from the text as a whole\nthat \u201cState registration\u201d cannot cover all registration\nrequirements, but only some. Cf. post, at 9\u201310 (KENNEDY,\nJ., dissenting).

Those \u201cstandards,\u201d set forth in\nsubsection (c)\u2014which is titled \u201cSingle State Registration\nSystem\u201d\u2014exclusively relate to State Registration of \u201cevi-\ndence of\u201d a Federal Permit, \u201cproof of\u201d insurance, and the\n\u201cname of a local agent for service of process,\u201d and state\nfees    \u201cfor    the   filing  of   proof     of   insurance.\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a714504(c)(2)(A)(i)\u2013(iv); \u00a714504(c)(2)(B)(iv). And the rest\nof the statute similarly deals exclusively with SSRS mat-\nters. See \u00a714504(a) (\u201cstandards\u201d mean \u201cthe specification of\nforms and procedures required\u201d to prove that a motor\ncarrier is in compliance with federal requirements). Thus,\nthe words \u201cState registration\u201d in the pre-emption provi-\nsion\u2019s first sentence refer only to state systems that seek\nevidence that a trucker has complied with specific, feder-\nally enumerated, SSRS obligations.          Cf. 49 U. S. C.\n\u00a713908(d) (\u00a714504\u2019s fees relate specifically to state efforts\nto obtain proof of insurance under the SSRS);\n\u00a7\u00a713908(b)(2)\u2013(3) (indicating that \u00a714504 refers to state\nrequirements having this purpose).\n   How could the same words in the second sentence refer\nto something totally different? We have found no lan-\nguage here or elsewhere in the statute (which we repro-\nduce in the Appendix, infra) suggesting that the term\n\u201cState registration requirement\u201d in sentence two refers to\nall State Registration requirements \u201cimposed on interstate\ncarriers by reason of their operation in interstate com-\nmerce.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20\n(emphasis in original). Indeed, to read the words \u201cby\nreason of . . .\u201d into \u00a714504, a linguistic stretch, would be\nwholly inconsistent with the statute\u2019s basic purposes,\nbecause it would leave a State free to implement a regula-\ntion in excess of specific SSRS limitations as long as it did\nnot single out interstate carriers (say, a neutral rule that\nall truckers must pay $50, or $500, per truck for proof of\ninsurance, or must designate multiple agents for service of\nprocess).

After first reading subsection (b)\nto say that a neutral base State requirement, despite\nbeing \u201cin excess\u201d of SSRS standards, is not an \u201cunreason-\nable burden on\u201d commerce, it then reads subsection (c) to\nsay that such a requirement, because it is \u201cin excess\u201d of\nSSRS standards, is nonetheless prohibited by the statute\n(in effect, an unreasonable burden on commerce). Post, at\n11\u201313. Aside from imposing significant complexities on\nthe statute where otherwise none would exist, this reading\nstretches subsection (c)\u2019s function beyond that which its\nstructure and language will allow.\n   Similarly, we see no language elsewhere in the statute\nsuggesting that the term \u201cState registration requirement\u201d\nrefers to any kind of State Registration whatsoever that\nmight affect interstate carriers. And even the Govern-\nment concedes that certain registration obligations\u2014those\nin \u201ctraditional areas of state regulation\u201d\u2014are beyond the\npre-emptive reach of the statute. Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 19. Finally, the implementing regula-\ntions do not support these broader constructions. See 49\nCFR \u00a7367.1 et seq. (2004).\n   Our reading of the text finds confirmation in historical\ncontext. Congress enacted \u00a714504 to simplify the old\n\u201cbingo card\u201d system. See Yellow Transp., 537 U. S., at 39\u2013\n40. Under the \u201cbingo card\u201d scheme, each State could\nindependently demand the same separate filings (evidence\nof a Federal Permit, proof of insurance, and a service-of-\nprocess agent) as well as separate fees. 49 U. S. C.\n\u00a7302(b)(2) (1976 ed.); \u00a711506 (1988 ed.); 49 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a71023.11, 1023.21, 1023.32, 1023.51 (1990). Federal law\ngoverning that scheme placed no express constraints on\nany state filings or fees other than those concerning Fed-\neral Permit and insurance requirements. Indeed, federal\nregulations specified that the federal \u201cbingo card\u201d statute\n                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndid not \u201caffect\u201d the \u201ccollection or [the] method of collection\nof taxes or fees by a State\u201d from interstate truckers \u201cfor\nthe operation of vehicles within\u201d its \u201cborders.\u201d \u00a71023.104.\nAnd they further provided that the statute did not \u201caffect\u201d\nstate requirements \u201cas to the external identification of\nvehicles to indicate the payment of a State tax or fee\nimposed for revenue purposes or for any other purpose\u201d\nnot governed by the \u201cbingo card\u201d system. \u00a71023.42.\n  When Congress created the new SSRS, it did not indi-\ncate (in the text, structure, or divinable purpose of the new\nprovision) that the pre-emptive scope of the new scheme\nwould be any broader than that of the old. See ISTEA,\n105 Stat. 1914. The relevant differences between the\nSSRS and the \u201cbingo card\u201d regime were that: (1) one State,\nrather than many, would collect the relevant filings; (2)\none State, rather than many, would collect the relevant\nfees; and (3) these fees, limited to the same amount as\nbefore, would relate to filing of proof of insurance rather\nthan to filing of the Federal Permit. Compare 49 U. S. C.\n\u00a711506 (1988 ed.) with \u00a714504 (2000 ed.); see also \u00a711506\n(1988 ed., Supp. IV). These modifications merely sought\nmore efficient, not greater, federal regulation. See Yellow\nTransp., supra; see also 49 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a713908(a), (d) (au-\nthorizing the Secretary to replace the SSRS with a yet\nmore streamlined system and pre-empting only those\nState \u201cinsurance filing requirements or fees that are for\nthe same purposes as filings or fees the Secretary requires\nunder the new system\u201d (emphasis added)). And while the\nnew regulations implementing the SSRS do not explicitly\nexempt unrelated state requirements from the statute\u2019s\npre-emptive reach, neither they nor the rulemaking that\nproduced them suggest any change to pre-existing practice\nin this respect. See 49 CFR \u00a7367.1 et seq. (2004); see also\nSingle-State Insurance Registration, 9 I. C.

C.,\nJan. 13, 1993) (proposing regulations, providing justifica-\ntions, and soliciting further comments).\n   Finally, we have found nothing in the statute\u2019s basic\npurposes or objectives\u2014improving the efficiency of the\n\u201cbingo card\u201d system and simplifying a uniform scheme for\nproviding States with certain vital information\u2014that\neither requires a broader reading of the statutory term, or\nthat impliedly pre-empts other, non-SSRS-related state\nrules. Cf. Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S.\n861, 881 (2000) (federal statutes by implication pre-empt\nstate law that stands \u201cas an obstacle to the accomplish-\nment and execution\u201d of their federal objectives (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). That is, we can find no indica-\ntion that Congress sought to use this narrowly focused\nstatute to forbid state fee or registration obligations that\nhave nothing to do with basic SSRS (or earlier \u201cbingo\ncard\u201d) objectives\u2014say, for example, a State Registration\nrequirement related to compliance by interstate carriers\nwith rules governing the introduction of foreign pests into\nthe jurisdiction, or with a State\u2019s version of the Amber\nAlert system, or with size, weight, and safety standards.\nThe Constitution\u2019s Commerce Clause may (or may not)\nforbid some such rules. But this statute\u2014which identifies\nand regulates very specific items\u2014says nothing about\nthem, and there is no reason to believe that Congress\nwished to resolve that kind of Commerce Clause issue in\nthis provision. Cf. 49 U. S. C. \u00a713908 (indicating that the\nSSRS may well be only a temporary system and similarly\nfocusing on limited, federally enumerated requirements\nwithout discussing broad pre-emption).\n   We conclude, as we have said, that the term \u201cState\nregistration requirement,\u201d as used in the second sentence\nof the SSRS statute, covers only those State Registration\nrequirements that concern the subject matter of that\nstatutory provision, namely the registration of a Federal\n                 Cite as: 545 U.

It neither explicitly\nnor implicitly reaches unrelated matters.\n                              B\n   The second legal question involves the Michigan statute\nimposing the $100 fee on Michigan-plated trucks operat-\ning entirely in interstate commerce. MCL \u00a7478.2(2) (West\n2002). Do the requirements set forth in that statute con-\ncern the SSRS statute\u2019s subject matter? We think that\nthey do not.\n   For one thing, the Michigan statute imposing the $100\nfee makes no reference to evidence of a Federal Permit, to\nany insurance requirement, or to an agent for receiving\nservice of process. Nor, as far as we can tell, do any state\nrules related to the $100 fee require the filing of informa-\ntion about these matters. See Equipment List Form P\u2013\n344\u2013T (requiring information about truck make, type,\nyear, unit number, and serial number).\n   For another thing, Michigan law imposed a separate fee\non interstate motor carriers with trucks license plated in\nMichigan before the SSRS existed and before Michigan\nbegan to participate in the \u201cbingo card\u201d system. See App.\n24\u201325; Plaintiffs\u2019 Second Motion for Partial Summary\nDisposition in No. 95\u201315628\u2013CM etc. (Mich. Ct. Cl.), p. 5;\nPlaintiffs-Appellants\u2019 Brief on Appeal, in No. 226052 etc.\n(Mich. Ct. App.), pp. 5\u20136; MCL \u00a7478.7(4) (West 2002).\nHence such a fee does not represent an effort somehow to\ncircumvent the limitations imposed in connection with\nfederal laws governing State Registration of Federal\nPermits.\n   Finally, Michigan rules provide that a Michigan-plated\ninterstate truck choosing Michigan as its SSRS base State\ncan apparently comply with Michigan\u2019s SSRS require-\nments even if it does not comply with Michigan\u2019s $100 fee\nrequirement. The owner of that truck can fill out Michi-\n12   MID-CON FREIGHT SYSTEMS, INC. v. MICHIGAN PUB.\n                    SERV.

It can also fill\nout form RS\u20132, on which it indicates the total SSRS fees it\nowes to all participating States whose borders the truck\nwill cross. Id., at 67. Upon submission of the two forms\nand payment of the fees, Michigan apparently will give the\nowner form RS\u20133, an SSRS receipt, a copy of which the\nowner can place in the vehicle of the truck, thereby com-\nplying with Michigan\u2019s (and all other participating States\u2019)\nSSRS-related \u201cState registration requirements.\u201d If that\nowner fails to pay Michigan\u2019s $100 fee for that truck, the\nowner will not receive a state fee decal. But that owner\nwill have violated only Michigan\u2019s $100 fee statute here at\nissue, MCL \u00a7478.2(2) (West 2002). Petitioners have pro-\nvided us with nothing that suggests the owner will have\nviolated any other provision of Michigan law.           See\n\u00a7478.7(4). And they have not demonstrated that Michigan\nlaw in practice holds hostage a truck owner\u2019s SSRS com-\npliance until the owner pays \u00a7478.2(2)\u2019s $100 fee.\n  On the other hand, we recognize that Michigan form\nRS\u20132, the form that lists all SSRS-participating States\ntogether with their SSRS-related fees, places an asterisk\nnext to Michigan and states that \u201c[v]ehicles base-plated in\nMichigan need not\u201d pay any SSRS fee but \u201care required to\nhave a $100.00\u201d Michigan decal. App. 67. Michigan\nthereby forgives Michigan-plated interstate trucks (which\nmust pay Michigan $100) payment of the $10 Michigan\nSSRS fee that would otherwise be due. And to that extent,\nthere is a connection between the $100 fee and the SSRS.\n  Michigan appears to forgive its $10 SSRS fee, however,\nonly for the Michigan-plated interstate trucks of a carrier\nthat has chosen Michigan as its SSRS \u201cbase\u201d State. See\nReply Brief for Petitioners 14\u201315, n. 8. Michigan-plated\ntrucks operating out of a different SSRS base State, say,\nOhio, must pay the fee, which is remitted back to Michi-\ngan. Thus, the $10 reduction can be seen simply as an\n                 Cite as: 545 U.

That\nsubsidiary connection cannot transform Michigan\u2019s $100\nfee, which exclusively involves non-SSRS subject matter\n(and was created for non-SSRS-related reasons), into a\nrequirement that concerns the subject matter of the SSRS\nstatute.\n                        *  *     *\n  For these reasons, we conclude that 49 U.

The Court also says the answer is no,\nbut for a different reason. It concludes that, even though\n\u00a7478.2(2) is a registration requirement, the term \u201cregistra-\ntion requirement\u201d in 49 U. S. C. \u00a714504(b) includes only\nthe subset of registration requirements that concern the\nsame subject matter as the SSRS. Neither the Court\u2019s\nreason, nor the different reason given by the Michigan\nCourt of Appeals, is persuasive.\n                              A\n  The Michigan Court of Appeals adopted a categorical\nrule: \u201cIf the purpose of a fee is to regulate an industry or\nservice, it can be properly classified as a regulatory fee,\u201d\nnot a registration fee. Westlake Transp., supra, at 605,\n662 N. W. 2d, at 795. Proceeding to apply the rule so\nannounced, the Court of Appeals held that the $100 fee\nimposed by MCL \u00a7478.2(2) on Michigan-plated interstate\ncarriers is a regulatory fee rather than a registration fee\nbecause the fee \u201cis imposed for the administration of the\n[Michigan Motor Carrier Act], particularly covering costs\nof enforcing safety regulations.\u201d 255 Mich.

In return,\nthe State provides the carrier with decals that it must\nplace on its trucks. See ante, at 3\u20134. If this is not a \u201cState\nregistration requirement\u201d in the general and ordinary\nsense of the term, it is hard to conceive of what is.\n  The Court of Appeals\u2019 holding would allow the State to\nconvert any registration fee into a regulatory fee simply by\ndeclaring a regulatory purpose or spending some portion of\nthe money collected on regulation or administration. The\nlogic of this approach excludes from the coverage of 49\nU. S.

Yet the Court\u2019s affirmance of the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 decision, coupled with the Court\u2019s failure\nto make its apparent disagreement with the reasoning\nexplicit, will result in the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019\nbroad rule surviving to work additional mischief in future\ncases, a most undesirable result in this area, where fees\nand regulatory requirements are so pervasive.\n                             B\n                             1\n  Although the Court appears to agree that MCL\n\u00a7478.2(2) imposes a state registration requirement on\ninterstate motor carriers, it holds, nonetheless, that the\nprovision is not pre-empted by 49 U.

This,\naccording to the Court, is because the phrase \u201cState regis-\ntration requirement\u201d in \u00a714504(b) refers not to state regis-\ntration requirements generally, but only to those state\nregistration requirements that concern the same subject\n4    MID-CON FREIGHT SYSTEMS, INC. v.

Ante, at 10\u201311. Section 14504(b) simply cannot\nbear the narrowing construction the Court seeks to impose\nupon it.\n   The first sentence of \u00a714504(b) authorizes States to\nimpose registration requirements on interstate motor\ncarriers if the registration \u201cis completed under standards\nof the Secretary under [\u00a714504(c)],\u201d i.e., under the SSRS.\nThe second sentence of \u00a714504(b) pre-empts \u201ca State\nregistration requirement\u201d that imposes \u201cobligations in\nexcess\u201d of the SSRS. There ought to be no question that\nMCL \u00a7478.2(2) is a state registration requirement. The\nCourt seems to agree, at least when the phrase \u201cState\nregistration requirement\u201d is used in its ordinary and\ngeneral sense. It should also be apparent that the obliga-\ntions imposed by \u00a7478.2(2) are in excess of those author-\nized by the standards of the Secretary under 49 U. S. C.\n\u00a714504(c). The plain text of \u00a714504(b), then, would appear\nto pre-empt MCL \u00a7478.2(2), at least when \u00a7478.2(2) is\nconsidered in isolation.\n   The Court, however, departs from the text of the stat-\nute. Title 49 U. S. C. \u00a714504(b), by its terms, saves from\npre-emption only one class of state registration require-\nments imposed on interstate motor carriers: those com-\npleted under standards of the Secretary under \u00a714504(c),\ni.e., those that are authorized under the SSRS. To this\nsubset the Court adds a second class of state registration\nrequirements saved from pre-emption: those that concern\nsubject matters not covered under \u00a714504(c). The prob-\nlem, of course, is that the statute simply does not provide\nfor the exemption the Court invents. There is no basis in\nthe statutory text or structure for adding this limitation,\nand the Court cannot carry its heavy burden to show why\nthe language Congress used in \u00a714504(b) should not be\ngiven its ordinary meaning.\n                 Cite as: 545 U.

It must follow, the Court says, that because the\nfirst sentence of \u00a714504(b) refers to SSRS registration, the\nphrase \u201cState registration requirement\u201d in the second\nsentence refers only to state registration requirements\nthat concern the same subject matter as the SSRS. Ante,\nat 6\u20137.\n   The Court\u2019s premise is faulty. The two terms in the first\nsentence\u2014\u201crequirement of a State that [an interstate\nmotor carrier] must register\u201d and \u201cregistration require-\nment\u201d\u2014are not, when taken by themselves, limited to\nstate registration requirements concerning the same\n\u201csubject matter\u201d as the SSRS. These terms, like the term\n\u201cState registration requirement\u201d in the second sentence of\n\u00a714504(b), refer generally to any state requirement that\nan interstate motor carrier register with the State. No\nnarrower reading is necessary to make perfect sense of\neach of \u00a714504(b)\u2019s two sentences and of how they operate\ntogether. The first sentence of \u00a714504(b) declares that the\nsubset of state registration requirements consisting of\nthose requirements authorized under the SSRS\u2014i.e.,\nrequirements \u201ccompleted under standards of the Secretary\nunder [\u00a714504(c)]\u201d\u2014are not pre-empted.           The second\nsentence of \u00a714504(b) says that all other state registration\nrequirements for interstate motor carriers are pre-empted.\nIt is difficult to understand the Court\u2019s mighty struggle to\nresist this simple, direct reading of the statutory language.\n   The Court also observes that there is no language else-\nwhere in the statute or in the implementing regulations\nsuggesting that \u201cState registration requirement\u201d in\n\u00a714504(b) refers to all types of state registration require-\nments imposed on interstate motor carriers, and the Court\n6    MID-CON FREIGHT SYSTEMS, INC. v.

Ante, at\n8. The first claim is irrelevant and the second is wrong.\nSection 14504(b) itself makes clear its pre-emptive scope,\nand confirmation by other statutory provisions or adminis-\ntrative regulations is unnecessary. And, while the United\nStates did say that \u00a714504(b) was not \u201cintended to pre-\nempt state laws and fees in traditional areas of state\nregulation,\u201d the reason the United States believes this is\nso is because \u00a714054(b) does not pre-empt general regis-\ntration requirements that do not apply specifically to\ninterstate motor carriers. Brief as Amicus Curiae 19\u201320.\n                             3\n   Perhaps sensing the weakness of its textual argument,\nthe Court turns to statutory history. The Court is correct\nto say that, before the enactment of \u00a714504(b) and the\nSSRS, federal law did not pre-empt state filings or fees\nother than those concerning federal permit and insurance\nrequirements. Ante, at 8\u20139. Pre-SSRS federal regula-\ntions, furthermore, specified that the federal statute did\nnot affect the power of States to collect other fees from\ninterstate motor carriers or to require decals indicating\npayment of these fees. Ibid. This is beside the point,\nhowever. The extent of pre-emption before enactment of\n\u00a714504(b) tells us little about \u00a714504(b)\u2019s pre-emptive\neffect. Similarly, the fact that pre-SSRS federal regula-\ntions preserved other state registration requirements is of\nminimal significance when, as the Court admits, the new\nregulations contain no such provisions. Ante, at 9. If\nanything, the failure to repromulgate regulations saving\nother state registration fees from pre-emption suggests\nthat the federal agency charged with implementing the\nSSRS did think that \u00a714504(b) expanded the scope of\nfederal pre-emption.\n                  Cite as: 545 U.

The Court makes\nno convincing argument that \u00a714504(b)\u2019s purpose was so\nlimited. The Court, furthermore, does not explain why the\nstatute\u2019s basic purposes require the Court\u2019s artificially\nnarrow reading of the facially broad statutory command.\nThe most the Court is willing to say is that it \u201ccan find no\nindication,\u201d ante, at 10, that when Congress said \u201cState\nregistration requirement,\u201d it meant \u201cState registration\nrequirement.\u201d So it says Congress must have meant\n\u201cState registration requirement concerning the same\nsubject matter as the SSRS.\u201d The text of \u00a714504(b), how-\never, does not admit of the qualifications the Court adds to\nit. The Court\u2019s argument from statutory purpose has no\nbasis.\n   The Court suggests that if Congress intended \u00a714504(b)\nto have the broad pre-emptive effect required by the text,\nCongress would have more clearly indicated that intention\nIbid. (\u201c[W]e can find no indication that Congress sought\u201d\nto pre-empt requirements not related to SSRS subject\nmatter). It is not entirely clear what sort of additional\nindication of congressional purpose the Court is looking\nfor. The text, as noted above, does provide an indication of\nCongress\u2019 intent. Perhaps the Court is troubled by the\nabsence of statements in the legislative history endorsing\n\u00a714504(b)\u2019s expansion of federal pre-emption. The lack of\nconfirmatory legislative history, however, is not a legiti-\nmate reason for imposing an artificial narrowing construc-\ntion on broad but clear statutory text. \u201c[I]t would be a\nstrange canon of statutory construction that would require\nCongress to state in committee reports or elsewhere in its\ndeliberations that which is obvious on the face of a stat-\nute.\u201d Harrison v.

It should be noted, however, that this\nphrase is ambiguous in a different respect. Section\n14504(b) might be read, on the one hand, to exempt inter-\nstate motor carriers from any non-SSRS state registration\nrequirement, including general requirements that apply to\nall motor carriers or to some other set of entities. On the\nother hand, \u00a714504(b) might be read to pre-empt only\nthose non-SSRS registration requirements that apply\nspecifically to interstate motor carriers. That is, \u00a714504(b)\nmight come into play only if being an interstate motor\ncarrier is a necessary or sufficient condition for imposition\nof a state registration requirement. The United States\ntakes the latter view of the statute, Brief as Amicus Cu-\nriae 17\u201322, and I am of the same opinion.\n  Though the phrase \u201cState registration requirement\u201d in\nthe second sentence of \u00a714504(b) is not qualified, it is clear\nfrom context that this term refers to a \u201crequirement of a\nState that a motor carrier providing [interstate transpor-\ntation] must register with the State,\u201d the more specific\nterm that appears in \u00a714509(b)\u2019s first sentence. It is\ngrammatically possible to read the statutory command as\nexempting interstate motor carriers from all registration\nrequirements other than the SSRS, but that reading\nwould lead to absurd results. It would suggest, for exam-\nple, that interstate motor carriers with a principal place of\nbusiness in Michigan do not have to register their pres-\n10   MID-CON FREIGHT SYSTEMS, INC. v.

In context, the\nmore natural and sensible reading of the phrase \u201crequire-\nment of a State that a motor carrier providing [interstate\ntransportation] must register with the State,\u201d includes\nonly those registration requirements that are triggered\nspecifically by the fact that the entity in question is an\ninterstate motor carrier.\n   Because \u00a714504(b) pre-empts state registration re-\nquirements that single out interstate carriers, but not\ngeneral state registration requirements that apply to\ninterstate carriers only incidentally, my analysis of\n\u00a714504(b) does not necessarily mean the Court\u2019s ultimate\nconclusion in this case is incorrect. Respondents contend\nthat MCL \u00a7478.2(2) applies only to trucks with Michigan\nlicense plates, and that \u00a7478.2(2) should be considered\ntogether with \u00a7478.2(1), which imposes a $100 fee on every\ntruck doing intrastate business within Michigan. Accord-\ning to the respondents, then, 49 U. S. C. \u00a714504(b) does\nnot come into play because interstate carriers are not\nsingled out; Michigan imposes the same $100 fee on all\nfor-hire motor vehicles license-plated in Michigan.

Given its erroneous\nview of the statute, the proper course should be to vacate\nthe Court of Appeals\u2019 decision and remand for further\nproceedings. Remanding the case would allow the Michi-\ngan courts to consider the competing arguments in light of\nthe correct legal interpretation of 49 U. S.

S. C. \u00a714504(b) would not pre-empt general, neutral\nrequirements, even if they dealt with subject matter simi-\nlar to that covered by the SSRS. The Court is wrong,\nhowever, to suggest this therefore means an SSRS could\ncollect from interstate motor carriers a $500 fee for proof\nof insurance or require designation of multiple agents for\nservice of process, as long as the requirement in question\napplied evenhandedly to all motor carriers. The Court\nerrs because it fails to give adequate consideration to the\nrestrictions imposed by \u00a714504(c).\n  Section 14504(c)(2)(A) declares that \u201conly a State acting\nin its capacity as a registration State under [the SSRS]\nmay require a motor carrier registered by the Secretary\nunder [the SSRS]\u201d to file proof of federal registration and\nproof of insurance, to collect fees for filing proof of insur-\nance, and to maintain a local agent for service of process.\nSection \u00a714504(c)(2)(B) constrains the SSRS registration\nrequirements and fees the SSRS registration State can\nimpose on interstate motor carriers. These sections con-\ntain an ambiguity similar to that which affects \u00a714504(b).\n12   MID-CON FREIGHT SYSTEMS, INC. v. MICHIGAN PUB.\n                    SERV. COMM\u2019N\n                  KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nContext, however, suggests that the ambiguity should be\nresolved differently. The best interpretation of \u00a714504(c),\nin my submission, is that no State participating in the\nSSRS other than an interstate motor carrier\u2019s designated\nSSRS registration State may impose requirements of the\nsort listed in \u00a714504(c)(2)(A) on that carrier, even if the\nrequirement is general and applies to all motor carriers.\nThe SSRS registration State, furthermore, may only im-\npose on registered interstate motor carriers requirements\nrelated to those listed in \u00a7\u00a714504(c)(2)(A)(i)\u2013(iv) if the\nState conforms to the restrictions in \u00a714504(c)(2)(B).\n   Taken together, the general pre-emption provision in\n\u00a714504(b) and the specific limitations on SSRS registra-\ntion States in \u00a714504(c) establish a rational regulatory\nscheme. Whether or not a State participates in the SSRS,\nit cannot impose a registration requirement that singles\nout interstate motor carriers unless that requirement is\nauthorized under the SSRS. States that participate in the\nSSRS may impose general, neutral registration require-\nments that happen to affect interstate motor carriers\nunless those requirements are inconsistent with the spe-\ncific mandates of the SSRS related to proof of insurance,\nproof of federal permit, fees, and service of process. Non-\nSSRS States may impose any general, neutral registration\nrequirement, even if they require interstate motor carri-\ners, among others, to file proof of insurance or maintain a\nlocal agent for service of process.\n   The Court\u2019s interpretation leads to a less sensible\nscheme. According to the Court, that statute permits\nStates to impose on interstate carriers any number of\nonerous requirements so long as these requirements are\nnot explicitly linked to the subjects covered by the SSRS.\nThe Court\u2019s interpretation, furthermore, means that those\nStates which are excluded from the SSRS under\n\u00a714504(c)(2)(D) may not apply general state registration\nrequirements to interstate motor carriers if the require-\n                 Cite as: 545 U.

Under the Court\u2019s interpreta-\ntion, the statute does not pre-empt state regulations that\nsingle out interstate carriers for special burdens well\nbeyond what the SSRS allows, but it does prevent non-\nSSRS States from applying a number of modest, even-\nhanded registration requirements to interstate carriers,\neven though the SSRS is not available to these States.\nThat implausible result is not demanded by the statute\u2019s\nbasic purposes.\n                        *     *     *\n  Instead of heeding what Congress actually said, the\nCourt relies on flawed textual analysis and dubious infer-\nences from legislative silence to impose the Court\u2019s view of\nwhat it thinks Congress probably wanted to say. In my\nview, this is a mistake. Other arguments, not considered\nby the Michigan Court of Appeals or by our Court, might\nsupport the ultimate outcome in this case. These argu-\nments, however, ought to be addressed on remand.\n",

We conclude that the Michigan fee requirement is not the kind of \"State registration requirement\" to which the federal statute refers. And for that reason, the statute does not pre-empt it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Federal law has long required most motor carriers doing interstate business to obtain a permit \u0097 which we shall call a Federal Permit \u0097 that reflects compliance with certain federal requirements. See 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 13901 <i>et seq.;</i> 49 CFR \u00a7 365.101 <i>et seq.</i> (2004). In 1965, Congress authorized States to require proof that the operator of an interstate truck had secured a Federal Permit. 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 302(b)(2) (1976 ed.); <span class=\"star-pagination\">*443</span> see generally <i>Yellow Transp., Inc.</i> v. <i>Michigan,</i> 537 U. S. 36, 39 (2002). By 1991, 39 States demanded such proof by requiring some form of what we shall call State Registration (of the Federal Permit). Those States typically would require truckers to file with a state agency evidence that each interstate truck was covered by a Federal Permit. They would require the trucker to pay a State Registration fee of up to $10 per truck. And they would issue a State Registration stamp that the trucker would affix to a multistate \"bingo card\" carried within the vehicle. See 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 1023.32, 1023.33 (1990); <i>Yellow Transp.,</i> 537 U. S., at 39.</p>\n<p>In 1991, Congress focused upon the fact that the \"bingo card\" system required a trucking company to obtain a separate stamp from each State through which an interstate truck traveled. It found this scheme inefficient and burdensome. See <i>id.,</i> at 39-40. And it enacted a statute setting forth a new system, the Single State Registration System (SSRS), which remains in effect today. Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504. The SSRS allows a trucking company to fill out <i>one</i> set of forms in <i>one</i> State (the base State), and by doing so to register its Federal Permit in <i>every</i> participating State through which its trucks will travel. \u00a7 14504(c); 49 CFR \u00a7 367.4(b) (2004).</p>\n<p>The SSRS statute says that the base State can demand: (1) proof of the trucking company's possession of a Federal Permit, (2) proof of insurance, (3) the name of an agent designated to receive \"service of process,\" and (4) a total fee (charged for the filing of the proof of insurance) equal to the sum of the individual state fees. 49 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 14504(c)(2)(A)(i)-(iv); 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 367.4(c)(1)-(4) (2004). Each individual state fee, it adds, cannot exceed the amount the State charged under the \"bingo card\" system, and in no event can it exceed $10 per truck. 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III). After a truck owner registers, base state officials provide the owner with a receipt to be kept in the cab <span class=\"star-pagination\">*444</span> of each registered truck. 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 367.5(a), (b), (e) (2004). The base State distributes to each participating State its share of the total registration fee. \u00a7 367.6(a).</p>\n<p>The SSRS statute specifies that a State may not impose any additional \"registration requirement.\" It states specifically, in the statutory sentence at issue here, that when a State Registration requirement imposes further obligations, \"the part in excess is an unreasonable burden.\" 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b). It adds that a State may not require \"decals, stamps, cab cards, or any other means of registering . . . specific vehicles.\" \u00a7 14504(c)(2)(B)(iii). And it provides that the \"charging or collection of any fee under this section that is not in accordance with the fee system established [in this provision] shall be deemed to be a burden on interstate commerce.\" \u00a7 14504(c)(2)(C). At the same time, the statute makes clear that a State that complies with the SSRS system need not fear Commerce Clause attack, for it says that a state requirement that an interstate truck \"must register with the State\" is \"not an unreasonable burden on transportation,\" provided that \"the State registration is completed\" in accordance with the SSRS statute. \u00a7 14504(b).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The state law at issue here, \u00a7 478.2(2) of the Michigan Motor Carrier Act, reads as follows:</p>\n<p>\"A motor carrier licensed in this state shall pay an annual fee of $100.00 for each vehicle operated by the motor carrier which is registered in this state [<i>i. e.,</i> which has a Michigan license plate] and operating entirely in interstate commerce.\"</p>\n<p>Related state rules and regulations require a carrier paying the $100 fee to identify each interstate truck by make, type, year, serial number, and unit number. See Equipment List Form P-344-T, App. to Defendant's Response to Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Disposition in No. 95-15628-CM etc. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*445</span> (Mich. Ct. Cl.) (hereinafter Equipment List Form P-344-T). They also make clear that, upon payment of the fee, the carrier will receive a decal that must be affixed to the truck. App. 24 (Affidavit of Pub. Serv. Comm'n. official Thomas R. Lonergan). And they provide that a carrier who pays this fee need not pay the $10 SSRS registration fee if the carrier chooses Michigan as its SSRS base State.

Hence they are subject to Michigan's $100 fee. MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) (West 2002). They asked a Michigan court to invalidate \u00a7 478.2(2) as pre-empted by the federal SSRS statute. 255 Mich. App., at 592, 662 N. W. 2d, at 789-790. The Michigan Court of Claims rejected their claim. <i>Id.,</i> at 593-594, 662 N. W. 2d, at 789-790. And the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed. <i>Id.,</i> at 604, 662 N.

S. C. \u00a7 14504(b). 255 Mich. App., at 604, 662 N. W. 2d, at 795.

We now affirm the Michigan court's judgment in this case, though for other reasons.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The first legal question before us concerns the meaning of the federal statutory words \"State registration requirement.\" They appear in a subsection that reads in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The requirement of a State that a motor carrier, providing [interstate transportation] in that State, must register with the State is not an unreasonable burden on transportation . . . when the State registration is completed under standards of the Secretary [of Transportation] under subsection (c). When a <i>State registration requirement</i> imposes obligations in excess of the standards of the Secretary, the part in excess is an unreasonable burden.\" 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>What is the scope of the italicized words?</p>\n<p>Petitioners ask us to give these words a broad interpretation, sweeping within their ambit every state requirement involving some form of individualized registration that affects an interstate motor carrier. Brief for Petitioners 15 (federal statute's limits apply \"to <i>all</i> interstate motor carriers compelled to register their operations with <i>any</i> State regulatory commission under any State law\" (emphasis in original)). The United States argues for a somewhat narrower interpretation, submitting that the words apply to \"state registration requirements that are imposed on interstate carriers <i>by reason of</i> their operation in interstate commerce.\" Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 19-20 (emphasis in original). In our view, however, the language, read in context, is yet more narrow.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*447</span> Reference to text, historical context, and purpose discloses that the words \"State registration requirement\" do not apply to <i>every</i> State Registration requirement that happens to cover interstate carriers, nor to <i>every</i> such requirement specifically focused on a trucking operation's interstate character. Rather, they apply only to those state requirements that concern <i>SSRS</i> <i>registration</i> \u0097 that is, registration with a State of evidence that a carrier possesses a Federal Permit, registration of proof of insurance, or registration of the name of an agent \"for service of process.\" \u00a7 14504(c)(2)(A)(iv). Thus, the federal provision pre-empts only those state requirements that (1) concern the subject matter of the SSRS and (2) are \"in excess\" of the requirements that the SSRS imposes in respect to that subject matter. See \u00a7 14504(b).</p>\n<p>To begin with, statutory language makes clear that the federal provision reaches no further. Section 14504(b)'s first sentence says that a state \"requirement\" that an interstate motor carrier must \"register with the State is not an unreasonable burden . . . when the State registration is completed under standards of the Secretary under subsection (c).\" <i>Ibid.</i> It is clear from the text as a whole that \"State registration\" cannot cover <i>all</i> registration requirements, but only some. Cf. <i>post,</i> at 464-465 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). The first sentence's reference to the \"standards of the Secretary\" (as well as the focus of the entire statute) tells us which. Those \"standards,\" set forth in subsection (c) \u0097 which is titled \"Single State Registration System\" \u0097 exclusively relate to State Registration of \"evidence of\" a Federal Permit, \"proof of\" insurance, and the \"name of a local agent for service of process,\" and state fees \"for the filing of proof of insurance.\" \u00a7\u00a7 14504(c)(2)(A)(i)-(iv); \u00a7 14504(c)(2)(B)(iv). And the rest of the statute similarly deals exclusively with SSRS matters. See \u00a7 14504(a) (\"standards\" mean \"the specification of forms and procedures required\" to prove that a motor carrier is in compliance with federal requirements). Thus, the words \"State registration\" in the pre-emption provision's first sentence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*448</span> refer only to state systems that seek evidence that a trucker has complied with specific, federally enumerated, <i>SSRS</i> obligations. Cf. 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 13908(d) (\u00a7 14504's fees relate specifically to state efforts to obtain proof of insurance under the SSRS); \u00a7\u00a7 13908(b)(2)-(3) (indicating that \u00a7 14504 refers to state requirements having this purpose).</p>\n<p>How could the same words in the second sentence refer to something totally different? We have found no language here or elsewhere in the statute (which we reproduce in the Appendix, <i>infra</i>) suggesting that the term \"State registration requirement\" in sentence two refers to all State Registration requirements \"imposed on interstate carriers <i>by reason of</i> their operation in interstate commerce.\" Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 20 (emphasis in original). Indeed, to read the words \"by reason of . . .\" into \u00a7 14504, a linguistic stretch, would be wholly inconsistent with the statute's basic purposes, because it would leave a State free to implement a regulation in excess of specific SSRS limitations as long as it did not single out interstate carriers (say, a neutral rule that all truckers must pay $50, or $500, per truck for proof of insurance, or must designate multiple agents for service of process). See <i>post,</i> at 463 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>To avoid this severely incongruous result, the dissent (which adopts the Government's view) must resort to interpretive acrobatics. After first reading subsection (b) to say that a neutral base state requirement, despite being \"in excess\" of SSRS standards, is not an \"unreasonable burden on\" commerce, it then reads subsection (c) to say that such a requirement, <i>because</i> it is \"in excess\" of SSRS standards, is nonetheless prohibited by the statute (in effect, an unreasonable burden on commerce). <i>Post,</i> at 466-468. Aside from imposing significant complexities on the statute where otherwise none would exist, this reading stretches subsection (c)'s function beyond that which its structure and language will allow.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*449</span> Similarly, we see no language elsewhere in the statute suggesting that the term \"State registration requirement\" refers to <i>any</i> kind of State Registration whatsoever that might affect interstate carriers. And even the Government concedes that certain registration obligations \u0097 those in \"traditional areas of state regulation\" \u0097 are beyond the pre-emptive reach of the statute. Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 19. Finally, the implementing regulations do not support these broader constructions. See 49 CFR \u00a7 367.1 <i>et seq.</i> (2004).</p>\n<p>Our reading of the text finds confirmation in historical context. Congress enacted \u00a7 14504 to simplify the old \"bingo card\" system. See <i>Yellow Transp.,</i> 537 U. S., at 39-40. Under the \"bingo card\" scheme, <i>each</i> State could independently demand the same separate filings (evidence of a Federal Permit, proof of insurance, and a service-of-process agent) as well as separate fees. 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 302(b)(2) (1976 ed.); \u00a7 11506 (1988 ed.); 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 1023.11, 1023.21, 1023.32, 1023.51 (1990). Federal law governing that scheme placed no express constraints on any state filings or fees other than those concerning Federal Permit and insurance requirements. Indeed, federal regulations specified that the federal \"bingo card\" statute did not \"affect\" the \"collection or [the] method of collection of taxes or fees by a State\" from interstate truckers \"for the operation of vehicles within\" its \"borders.\" \u00a7 1023.104. And they further provided that the statute did not \"affect\" state requirements \"as to the external identification of vehicles to indicate the payment of a State tax or fee imposed for revenue purposes or for any other purpose\" not governed by the \"bingo card\" system. \u00a7 1023.42.</p>\n<p>When Congress created the new SSRS, it did not indicate (in the text, structure, or divinable purpose of the new provision) that the pre-emptive scope of the new scheme would be any broader than that of the old. See ISTEA, 105 Stat. 1914. The relevant differences between the SSRS and the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*450</span> \"bingo card\" regime were that: (1) one State, rather than many, would collect the relevant filings; (2) one State, rather than many, would collect the relevant fees; and (3) these fees, limited to the same amount as before, would relate to filing of proof of insurance rather than to filing of the Federal Permit. Compare 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 11506 (1988 ed.) with \u00a7 14504 (2000 ed.); see also \u00a7 11506 (1988 ed., Supp. IV). These modifications merely sought more efficient, not greater, federal regulation. See <i>Yellow Transp., supra</i><i>;</i> see also 49 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 13908(a), (d) (authorizing the Secretary to replace the SSRS with a yet more streamlined system and pre-empting only those State \"insurance filing requirements or fees that <i>are for the same purposes</i> as filings or fees the Secretary requires under the new system\" (emphasis added)). And while the new regulations implementing the SSRS do not explicitly exempt unrelated state requirements from the statute's pre-emptive reach, neither they nor the rulemaking that produced them suggest any change to pre-existing practice in this respect. See 49 CFR \u00a7 367.1 <i>et seq.</i> (2004); see also <i>Single State Insurance Registration,</i> 9 I. C. C. 2d 610 (1993) (Interstate Commerce Commission decision announcing new regulations); <i>Single State Insurance Registration,</i> No. MC-100 (Sub-No. 6), <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">17833</span></span> (I. C. C., Jan. 13, 1993) (proposing regulations, providing justifications, and soliciting further comments).</p>\n<p>Finally, we have found nothing in the statute's basic purposes or objectives \u0097 improving the efficiency of the \"bingo card\" system and simplifying a uniform scheme for providing States with certain vital information \u0097 that either requires a broader reading of the statutory term, or that impliedly pre-empts other, non-SSRS-related state rules. Cf. <i>Geier</i> v. <i>American Honda Motor Co.,</i> 529 U. S. 861, 881 (2000) (federal statutes by implication pre-empt state law that stands \"as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution\" of their federal objectives (internal quotation marks omitted)). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*451</span> That is, we can find no indication that Congress sought to use this narrowly focused statute to forbid state fee or registration obligations that have nothing to do with basic SSRS (or earlier \"bingo card\") objectives \u0097 say, for example, a State Registration requirement related to compliance by interstate carriers with rules governing the introduction of foreign pests into the jurisdiction, or with a State's version of the Amber Alert system, or with size, weight, and safety standards. The Constitution's Commerce Clause may (or may not) forbid some such rules. But this statute \u0097 which identifies and regulates very specific items \u0097 says nothing about them, and there is no reason to believe that Congress wished to resolve <i>that</i> kind of Commerce Clause issue in this provision. Cf. 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 13908 (indicating that the SSRS may well be only a temporary system and similarly focusing on limited, federally enumerated requirements without discussing broad pre-emption).</p>\n<p>We conclude, as we have said, that the term \"State registration requirement,\" as used in the second sentence of the SSRS statute, covers only those State Registration requirements that concern the subject matter of that statutory provision, namely, the registration of a Federal Permit, proof of insurance, and the name of an agent for service of process. See <i>supra,</i> at 446-447. It neither explicitly nor implicitly reaches unrelated matters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The second legal question involves the Michigan statute imposing the $100 fee on Michigan-plated trucks operating entirely in interstate commerce. MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) (West 2002). Do the requirements set forth in that statute concern the SSRS statute's subject matter? We think that they do not.</p>\n<p>For one thing, the Michigan statute imposing the $100 fee makes no reference to evidence of a Federal Permit, to any insurance requirement, or to an agent for receiving service <span class=\"star-pagination\">*452</span> of process. Nor, as far as we can tell, do any state rules related to the $100 fee require the filing of information about these matters. See Equipment List Form P-344-T (requiring information about truck make, type, year, unit number, and serial number).</p>\n<p>For another thing, Michigan law imposed a separate fee on interstate motor carriers with trucks license plated in Michigan before the SSRS existed and before Michigan began to participate in the \"bingo card\" system. See App. 24-25; Plaintiffs' Second Motion for Partial Summary Disposition in No. 95-15628-CM etc. (Mich. Ct. Cl.), p. 5; Plaintiffs-Appellants' Brief on Appeal, in No. 226052 etc. (Mich. Ct. App.), pp. 5-6; MCL \u00a7 478.7(4) (West 2002). Hence such a fee does not represent an effort somehow to circumvent the limitations imposed in connection with federal laws governing State Registration of Federal Permits.</p>\n<p>Finally, Michigan rules provide that a Michigan-plated interstate truck choosing Michigan as its SSRS base State can apparently comply with Michigan's SSRS requirements even if it does not comply with Michigan's $100 fee requirement. The owner of that truck can fill out Michigan form RS-1, thereby providing Michigan with evidence that it has a Federal Permit. App. 65-66. It can also fill out form RS-2, on which it indicates the total SSRS fees it owes to all participating States whose borders the truck will cross. <i>Id.,</i> at 67. Upon submission of the two forms and payment of the fees, Michigan apparently will give the owner form RS-3, an SSRS receipt, a copy of which the owner can place in the vehicle of the truck, thereby complying with Michigan's (and all other participating States') SSRS-related \"State registration requirements.\" If that owner fails to pay Michigan's $100 fee for that truck, the owner will not receive a state fee decal. But that owner will have violated only Michigan's $100 fee statute here at issue, MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) (West 2002). Petitioners have provided us with nothing that suggests the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*453</span> owner will have violated any other provision of Michigan law. See \u00a7 478.7(4). And they have not demonstrated that Michigan law in practice holds hostage a truck owner's SSRS compliance until the owner pays \u00a7 478.2(2)'s $100 fee.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, we recognize that Michigan form RS-2, the form that lists all SSRS-participating States together with their SSRS-related fees, places an asterisk next to Michigan and states that \"[v]ehicles base-plated in Michigan need not\" pay any SSRS fee but \"are required to have a $100.00\" Michigan decal. App. 67. Michigan thereby forgives Michigan-plated interstate trucks (which must pay Michigan $100) payment of the $10 Michigan SSRS fee that would otherwise be due. And to that extent, there is a connection between the $100 fee and the SSRS.</p>\n<p>Michigan appears to forgive its $10 SSRS fee, however, only for the Michigan-plated interstate trucks of a carrier that has chosen Michigan as its SSRS \"base\" State. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 14-15, n. 8. Michigan-plated trucks operating out of a different SSRS base State, say, Ohio, must pay the fee, which is remitted back to Michigan. Thus, the $10 reduction can be seen simply as an effort to provide modest, administratively efficient (because Michigan itself is handling both fees) recompense to those motor carriers that operate Michigan-plated trucks and choose Michigan as their SSRS base State. That subsidiary connection cannot transform Michigan's $100 fee, which exclusively involves non-SSRS subject matter (and was created for non-SSRS-related reasons), into a requirement that concerns the subject matter of the SSRS statute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, we conclude that 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b) does not pre-empt Michigan's $100 fee. The judgment of the Michigan Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*454</span> APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT</h2>\n<p>Title 49 U.

Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 478.2(2) (West 2002) (hereinafter MCL) is not a registration requirement. <i>Westlake Transp., Inc.</i> v. <i>Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1607911\"><a href=\"/opinion/1607911/westlake-transportation-inc-v-psc/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

Our Court, too, errs by concluding that the term \"State registration requirement\" in 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b) includes only those state registration requirements that \"concern the [same] subject matter\" as the Single State Registration System (SSRS) established by \u00a7 14504(c). <i>Ante,</i> at 447, 451. This respectful dissent explains my reasons for rejecting these two holdings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*457</span> I</h2>\n<p>Title 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14504(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The requirement of a State that a motor carrier, providing [interstate transportation] in that State, must register with the State is not an unreasonable burden on transportation . . . when the State registration is completed under standards of the Secretary [of Transportation] under [\u00a7 14504(c)]. When a State registration requirement imposes obligations in excess of the standards of the Secretary, the part in excess is an unreasonable burden.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The dispositive question in the instant case is whether MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) is a \"State registration requirement\" within the meaning of the second sentence of 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b). The Michigan Court of Appeals said the answer is no because MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) is not a registration requirement at all. The Court also says the answer is no, but for a different reason. It concludes that, even though \u00a7 478.2(2) is a registration requirement, the term \"registration requirement\" in 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b) includes only the subset of registration requirements that concern the same subject matter as the SSRS. Neither the Court's reason, nor the different reason given by the Michigan Court of Appeals, is persuasive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Michigan Court of Appeals adopted a categorical rule: \"If the purpose of a fee is to regulate an industry or service, it can be properly classified as a regulatory fee,\" not a registration fee. 255 Mich. App., at 605, 662 N. W. 2d, at 795. Proceeding to apply the rule so announced, the Court of Appeals held that the $100 fee imposed by MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) on Michigan-plated interstate carriers is a regulatory fee rather than a registration fee because the fee is \"imposed for the administration of the [Michigan Motor Carrier Act], particularly covering costs of enforcing safety regulations.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 604, 662 N. W. 2d, at 795.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*458</span> The majority affirms the judgment below, but \"for other reasons.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 446. The Court's reluctance to adopt the Michigan Court of Appeals' rationale is understandable. MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) and related state rules and regulations require a motor carrier that wants to operate Michigan-plated vehicles in interstate commerce in Michigan to fill out a form providing detailed identifying information for each vehicle and to pay a $100-per-vehicle fee. In return, the State provides the carrier with decals that it must place on its trucks. See <i>ante,</i> at 444-445. If this is not a \"State registration requirement\" in the general and ordinary sense of the term, it is hard to conceive of what is.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals' holding would allow the State to convert any registration fee into a regulatory fee simply by declaring a regulatory purpose or spending some portion of the money collected on regulation or administration. The logic of this approach excludes from the coverage of 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b) almost all state requirements, including those dealing with similar subject matter as the SSRS. The purpose of SSRS requirements, after all, is to regulate the interstate motor carrier industry; and the fees collected are used to administer the system. The Court's disapproval of the Michigan Court of Appeals' reasoning is implicit in the Court's decision to affirm on a different ground. <i>Ante,</i> at 446. Yet the Court's affirmance of the Court of Appeals' decision, coupled with the Court's failure to make its apparent disagreement with the reasoning explicit, will result in the Michigan Court of Appeals' broad rule surviving to work additional mischief in future cases, a most undesirable result in this area, where fees and regulatory requirements are so pervasive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>Although the Court appears to agree that MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) imposes a state registration requirement on interstate motor carriers, it holds, nonetheless, that the provision is not pre-empted by 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b). This, according to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*459</span> Court, is because the phrase \"State registration requirement\" in \u00a7 14504(b) refers not to state registration requirements generally, but only to those state registration requirements that concern the same subject matter as the SSRS: registration of a federal permit, proof of insurance, and designation of an agent for service of process. <i>Ante,</i> at 451. Section 14504(b) simply cannot bear the narrowing construction the Court seeks to impose upon it.</p>\n<p>The first sentence of \u00a7 14504(b) authorizes States to impose registration requirements on interstate motor carriers if the registration \"is completed under standards of the Secretary under [\u00a7 14504(c)],\" <i>i. e.,</i> under the SSRS. The second sentence of \u00a7 14504(b) pre-empts \"a State registration requirement\" that imposes \"obligations in excess\" of the SSRS. There ought to be no question that MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) is a state registration requirement. The Court seems to agree, at least when the phrase \"State registration requirement\" is used in its ordinary and general sense. It should also be apparent that the obligations imposed by \u00a7 478.2(2) are in excess of those authorized by the standards of the Secretary under 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(c). The plain text of \u00a7 14504(b), then, would appear to pre-empt MCL \u00a7 478.2(2), at least when \u00a7 478.2(2) is considered in isolation.</p>\n<p>The Court, however, departs from the text of the statute. Title 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b), by its terms, saves from pre-emption only one class of state registration requirements imposed on interstate motor carriers: those completed under standards of the Secretary under \u00a7 14504(c), <i>i. e.,</i> those that are authorized under the SSRS. To this subset the Court adds a second class of state registration requirements saved from pre-emption: those that concern subject matters not covered under \u00a7 14504(c). The problem, of course, is that the statute simply does not provide for the exemption the Court invents. There is no basis in the statutory text or structure for adding this limitation, and the Court cannot carry its heavy burden to show why the language Congress used in \u00a7 14504(b) should not be given its ordinary meaning.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*460</span> 2</h2>\n<p>The Court makes only one textual argument for the limitation it superimposes on \u00a7 14504(b)'s second sentence. The second sentence, the Court reasons, refers to the same set of state registration requirements discussed in the first sentence. It must follow, the Court says, that because the first sentence of \u00a7 14504(b) refers to SSRS registration, the phrase \"State registration requirement\" in the second sentence refers only to state registration requirements that concern the same subject matter as the SSRS. <i>Ante,</i> at 447-448.</p>\n<p>The Court's premise is faulty. The two terms in the first sentence \u0097 \"requirement of a State that [an interstate motor carrier] must register\" and \"registration requirement\" \u0097 are not, when taken by themselves, limited to state registration requirements concerning the same \"subject matter\" as the SSRS. These terms, like the term \"State registration requirement\" in the second sentence of \u00a7 14504(b), refer generally to any state requirement that an interstate motor carrier register with the State. No narrower reading is necessary to make perfect sense of each of \u00a7 14504(b)'s two sentences and of how they operate together. The first sentence of \u00a7 14504(b) declares that the subset of state registration requirements consisting of those requirements authorized under the SSRS \u0097 <i>i. e.,</i> requirements \"completed under standards of the Secretary under [\u00a7 14504(c)]\" \u0097 are not pre-empted. The second sentence of \u00a7 14504(b) says that all other state registration requirements for interstate motor carriers are pre-empted. It is difficult to understand the Court's mighty struggle to resist this simple, direct reading of the statutory language.</p>\n<p>The Court also observes that there is no language elsewhere in the statute or in the implementing regulations suggesting that \"State registration requirement\" in \u00a7 14504(b) refers to all types of state registration requirements imposed on interstate motor carriers, and the Court asserts that even <span class=\"star-pagination\">*461</span> the United States concedes that certain registration obligations in traditional areas of state regulation are beyond the statute's pre-emptive reach. <i>Ante,</i> at 449. The first claim is irrelevant and the second is wrong. Section 14504(b) itself makes clear its pre-emptive scope, and confirmation by other statutory provisions or administrative regulations is unnecessary. And, while the United States did say that \u00a7 14504(b) was not \"intended to preempt state laws and fees in traditional areas of state regulation,\" the reason the United States believes this is so is because \u00a7 14054(b) does not pre-empt general registration requirements that do not apply specifically to interstate motor carriers. Brief as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 19-20.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3</h2>\n<p>Perhaps sensing the weakness of its textual argument, the Court turns to statutory history. The Court is correct to say that, before the enactment of \u00a7 14504(b) and the SSRS, federal law did not pre-empt state filings or fees other than those concerning federal permit and insurance requirements. <i>Ante,</i> at 449. Pre-SSRS federal regulations, furthermore, specified that the federal statute did not affect the power of States to collect other fees from interstate motor carriers or to require decals indicating payment of these fees. <i>Ibid.</i> This is beside the point, however. The extent of pre-emption before enactment of \u00a7 14504(b) tells us little about \u00a7 14504(b)'s pre-emptive effect. Similarly, the fact that pre-SSRS federal regulations preserved other state registration requirements is of minimal significance when, as the Court admits, the new regulations contain no such provisions. <i>Ante,</i> at 450. If anything, the failure to repromulgate regulations saving other state registration fees from pre-emption suggests that the federal agency charged with implementing the SSRS did think that \u00a7 14504(b) expanded the scope of federal pre-emption.</p>\n<p>The Court's meaning is therefore obscure when it declares that Congress \"did not indicate (in the text, structure, or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*462</span> divinable purpose of the new provision) that the pre-emptive scope of the new scheme would be any broader than that of the old.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 449. Congress did indicate an expansion of federal pre-emption in \u00a7 14504(b)'s \"text\" and \"structure\" \u0097 it did so by replacing a narrow pre-emption clause with a broad pre-emption clause. Congress is not required to say, \"We really mean it.\" Cf. <i>Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc.</i> v. <i>Nigh,</i> 543 U. S. 50, 73 (2004) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (\"I hardly think it `scant indication' of intent to alter [the meaning of a statute] that Congress <i>amended the text of the statute</i>\" (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p>Perhaps the Court means to suggest that what appears to be the plain meaning of \u00a7 14504(b) is put in doubt by the fact that the predecessor statute's pre-emptive scope was much more limited. Comparison with predecessor statutes, however, is permissible only to resolve statutory ambiguity that exists independent of the comparison with the predecessor statute; comparison with predecessor statutes cannot be used to create ambiguity about the meaning of an otherwise clear statute. <i>Lamie</i> v. <i>United States Trustee,</i> 540 U. S. 526, 533-535 (2004); see also <i>Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc.,</i> 543 U. S., at 66-67 (KENNEDY, J., concurring); <i>id.,</i> at 67 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment); <i>id.,</i> at 73 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4</h2>\n<p>The Court's final reason for imposing its narrowing construction on \u00a7 14504(b) is that the Court has found \"nothing in the statute's basic purposes . . . that . . . requires a broader reading of the statutory term . . . .\" <i>Ante,</i> at 450. In the Court's view the only purpose of \u00a7 14504 is to make minor improvements in the efficiency of the old bingo card system. <i>Ante,</i> at 449-450. The Court makes no convincing argument that \u00a7 14504(b)'s purpose was so limited. The Court, furthermore, does not explain why the statute's basic purposes require the Court's artificially narrow reading of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*463</span> facially broad statutory command. The most the Court is willing to say is that it \"can find no indication,\" <i>ante,</i> at 451, that when Congress said \"State registration requirement,\" it meant \"State registration requirement.\" So it says Congress must have meant \"State registration requirement concerning the same subject matter as the SSRS.\" The text of \u00a7 14504(b), however, does not admit of the qualifications the Court adds to it. The Court's argument from statutory purpose has no basis.</p>\n<p>The Court suggests that if Congress intended \u00a7 14504(b) to have the broad pre-emptive effect required by the text, Congress would have more clearly indicated that intention. <i>Ibid.</i> (\"[W]e can find no indication that Congress sought\" to pre-empt requirements not related to SSRS subject matter). It is not entirely clear what sort of additional indication of congressional purpose the Court is looking for. The text, as noted above, does provide an indication of Congress' intent. Perhaps the Court is troubled by the absence of statements in the legislative history endorsing \u00a7 14504(b)'s expansion of federal pre-emption. The lack of confirmatory legislative history, however, is not a legitimate reason for imposing an artificial narrowing construction on broad but clear statutory text. \"[I]t would be a strange canon of statutory construction that would require Congress to state in committee reports or elsewhere in its deliberations that which is obvious on the face of a statute.\" <i>Harrison</i> v. <i>PPG Industries, Inc.,</i> 446 U. S. 578, 592 (1980). See also <i>Morales</i> v. <i>Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</i> 504 U. S. 374, 385, n. 2 (1992) (\"[L]egislative history need not confirm the details of changes in the law effected by statutory language before we will interpret that language according to its natural meaning\"); <i>Chisom</i> v. <i>Roemer,</i> 501 U. S. 380, 406 (1991) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (\"We are here to apply the statute, not legislative history, and certainly not the absence of legislative history\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*464</span> II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In my submission, the phrase \"State registration requirement\" in \u00a7 14504(b) cannot be read as limited to state registration requirements that concern one particular subject matter. It should be noted, however, that this phrase is ambiguous in a different respect. Section 14504(b) might be read, on the one hand, to exempt interstate motor carriers from any non-SSRS state registration requirement, including general requirements that apply to all motor carriers or to some other set of entities. On the other hand, \u00a7 14504(b) might be read to pre-empt only those non-SSRS registration requirements that apply specifically to interstate motor carriers. That is, \u00a7 14504(b) might come into play only if being an interstate motor carrier is a necessary or sufficient condition for imposition of a state registration requirement. The United States takes the latter view of the statute, Brief as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 17-22, and I am of the same opinion.</p>\n<p>Though the phrase \"State registration requirement\" in the second sentence of \u00a7 14504(b) is not qualified, it is clear from context that this term refers to a \"requirement of a State that a motor carrier, providing [interstate transportation] must register with the State,\" the more specific term that appears in \u00a7 14509(b)'s first sentence. It is grammatically possible to read the statutory command as exempting interstate motor carriers from all registration requirements other than the SSRS, but that reading would lead to absurd results. It would suggest, for example, that interstate motor carriers with a principal place of business in Michigan do not have to register their presence for purposes of state tax collection. In context, the more natural and sensible reading of the phrase \"requirement of a State that a motor carrier, providing [interstate transportation] must register with the State\" includes only those registration requirements that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*465</span> are triggered specifically by the fact that the entity in question is an interstate motor carrier.</p>\n<p>Because \u00a7 14504(b) pre-empts state registration requirements that single out interstate carriers, but not general state registration requirements that apply to interstate carriers only incidentally, my analysis of \u00a7 14504(b) does not necessarily mean the Court's ultimate conclusion in this case is incorrect. Respondents contend that MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) applies only to trucks with Michigan license plates, and that \u00a7 478.2(2) should be considered together with \u00a7 478.2(1), which imposes a $100 fee on every truck doing intrastate business within Michigan. According to respondents, then, 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b) does not come into play because interstate carriers are not singled out; Michigan imposes the same $100 fee on all for-hire motor vehicles license plated in Michigan. Brief for Respondents 44-45. Petitioners and the United States take issue with this argument. Reply Brief for Petitioners 10-14; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 24-29.</p>\n<p>In my view it is not necessary to reach this question. The Michigan Court of Appeals resolved the case on the incorrect theory that a fee is not a registration fee if its purpose is to regulate the industry. Given its erroneous view of the statute, the proper course should be to vacate the Court of Appeals' decision and remand for further proceedings. Remanding the case would allow the Michigan courts to consider the competing arguments in light of the correct legal interpretation of 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b). Respondents would, at that stage, be able to advance their arguments that MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) is not pre-empted when it is considered in conjunction with \u00a7 478.2(1) or any other aspect of the statutory scheme that bears on whether Michigan imposes registration requirements specifically on interstate motor carriers beyond those authorized under the SSRS.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*466</span> B</h2>\n<p>The Court insists that to read \"requirement that a motor carrier providing [interstate transportation] must register with the State\" as including only those requirements that apply specifically to interstate motor carriers would be \"wholly inconsistent with the statute's basic purposes, because it would leave a State free to implement a regulation in excess of specific SSRS limitations as long as it did not single out interstate carriers. . . .\" <i>Ante,</i> at 448. The Court is correct that, under my interpretation, 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504(b) would not pre-empt general, neutral requirements, even if they dealt with subject matter similar to that covered by the SSRS. The Court is wrong, however, to suggest this therefore means an SSRS could collect from interstate motor carriers a $500 fee for proof of insurance or require designation of multiple agents for service of process, as long as the requirement in question applied evenhandedly to all motor carriers. The Court errs because it fails to give adequate consideration to the restrictions imposed by \u00a7 14504(c).</p>\n<p>Section 14504(c)(2)(A) declares that \"only a State acting in its capacity as [a] registration State under [the SSRS] may require a motor carrier registered by the Secretary under [the SSRS]\" to file proof of federal registration and proof of insurance, to collect fees for filing proof of insurance, and to maintain a local agent for service of process. Section 14504(c)(2)(B) constrains the SSRS registration requirements and fees the SSRS registration State can impose on interstate motor carriers. These sections contain an ambiguity similar to that which affects \u00a7 14504(b). Context, however, suggests that the ambiguity should be resolved differently. The best interpretation of \u00a7 14504(c), in my submission, is that no State participating in the SSRS other than an interstate motor carrier's designated SSRS registration State may impose requirements of the sort listed in \u00a7 14504(c)(2)(A) on that carrier, even if the requirement is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*467</span> general and applies to all motor carriers. The SSRS registration State, furthermore, may only impose on registered interstate motor carriers requirements related to those listed in \u00a7\u00a7 14504(c)(2)(A)(i)-(iv) if the State conforms to the restrictions in \u00a7 14504(c)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>Taken together, the general pre-emption provision in \u00a7 14504(b) and the specific limitations on SSRS registration States in \u00a7 14504(c) establish a rational regulatory scheme. Whether or not a State participates in the SSRS, it cannot impose a registration requirement that singles out interstate motor carriers unless that requirement is authorized under the SSRS. States that participate in the SSRS may impose general, neutral registration requirements that happen to affect interstate motor carriers unless those requirements are inconsistent with the specific mandates of the SSRS related to proof of insurance, proof of federal permit, fees, and service of process. Non-SSRS States may impose any general, neutral registration requirement, even if they require interstate motor carriers, among others, to file proof of insurance or maintain a local agent for service of process.</p>\n<p>The Court's interpretation leads to a less sensible scheme. According to the Court, that statute permits States to impose on interstate carriers any number of onerous requirements so long as these requirements are not explicitly linked to the subjects covered by the SSRS. The Court's interpretation, furthermore, means that those States which are excluded from the SSRS under \u00a7 14504(c)(2)(D) may not apply general state registration requirements to interstate motor carriers if the requirements concern proof of insurance or registration of an agent for service of process. Under the Court's interpretation, the statute does not pre-empt state regulations that single out interstate carriers for special burdens well beyond what the SSRS allows, but it does prevent non-SSRS States from applying a number of modest, evenhanded registration requirements to interstate carriers, even <span class=\"star-pagination\">*468</span> though the SSRS is not available to these States. That implausible result is not demanded by the statute's basic purposes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Instead of heeding what Congress actually said, the Court relies on flawed textual analysis and dubious inferences from legislative silence to impose the Court's view of what it thinks Congress probably wanted to say. In my view, this is a mistake. Other arguments, not considered by the Michigan Court of Appeals or by our Court, might support the ultimate outcome in this case. These arguments, however, ought to be addressed on remand.</p>\n</div>",
