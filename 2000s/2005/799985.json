The question presented is whether, in a habeas case, such motions are subject to the additional restrictions that apply to \"second or successive\" habeas corpus petitions under the provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), codified at 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244(b).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Aurelio Gonzalez pleaded guilty in Florida Circuit Court to one count of robbery with a firearm. He filed no appeal and began serving his 99-year sentence in 1982. Some 12 years later, petitioner began to seek relief from his conviction. He filed two motions for state postconviction relief, which the Florida courts denied. Thereafter, in June 1997, petitioner filed a federal habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*527</span> alleging that his guilty plea had not been entered knowingly and voluntarily.</p>\n<p>Upon the State's motion, the District Court dismissed petitioner's habeas petition as barred by AEDPA's statute of limitations, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244(d). Under Eleventh Circuit precedent, petitioner's filing deadline, absent tolling, was April 23, 1997, one year after AEDPA's statute of limitations took effect. <i>Wilcox</i> v. <i>Florida Dept. of Corrections,</i> 158 F. 3d 1209, 1211 (CA11 1998) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> Adopting a Magistrate Judge's recommendation, the District Court concluded that the limitations period was not tolled during the 163-day period while petitioner's second motion for state postconviction relief was pending. Section 2244(d)(2) tolls the statute of limitations during the pendency of \"properly filed\" applications only, and the District Court thought petitioner's motion was not \"properly filed\" because it was both untimely and successive. Without tolling, petitioner's federal habeas petition was two months late, so the District Court dismissed it as time barred. A judge of the Eleventh Circuit denied a certificate of appealability (COA) on April 6, 2000, and petitioner did not file for rehearing or review of that decision.</p>\n<p>On November 7, 2000, we held in <i>Artuz</i> v. <i>Bennett,</i> 531 U. S. 4, that an application for state postconviction relief can be \"properly filed\" even if the state courts dismiss it as procedurally barred. See <i>id.,</i> at 8-9. Almost nine months later, petitioner filed in the District Court a <i>pro se</i> \"Motion to Amend or Alter Judgment,\" contending that the District Court's time-bar ruling was incorrect under <i>Artuz</i>'s construction of \u00a7 2244(d), and invoking Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6), which permits a court to relieve a party from the effect of a final judgment.<sup>[1]</sup> The District Court denied the motion, and petitioner appealed.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*528</span> A judge of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit granted petitioner a COA, but a panel quashed the certificate as improvidently granted. 317 F. 3d 1308, 1310, 1314 (2003). The full court vacated that order and reheard the case en banc. It granted petitioner a COA but held, by a vote of 7 to 4, that the District Court was correct to deny his Rule 60(b) motion. The en banc majority determined that petitioner's motion\u0097indeed, any postjudgment motion under Rule 60(b) save one alleging fraud on the court under Rule 60(b)(3)\u0097was in substance a second or successive habeas corpus petition. 366 F. 3d 1253, 1278, 1281-1282 (2004). A state prisoner may not file such a petition without precertification by the court of appeals that the petition meets certain stringent criteria. \u00a7 2244(b). Because petitioner's motion did not satisfy these requirements, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed its denial. <i>Id.,</i> at 1282.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari. 543 U. S. 1086 (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Rule 60(b) allows a party to seek relief from a final judgment, and request reopening of his case, under a limited set of circumstances including fraud, mistake, and newly discovered evidence.<sup>[2]</sup> Rule 60(b)(6), the particular provision <span class=\"star-pagination\">*529</span> under which petitioner brought his motion, permits reopening when the movant shows \"any . . . reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment\" other than the more specific circumstances set out in Rules 60(b)(1)-(5). See <i>Liljeberg</i> v. <i>Health Services Acquisition Corp.,</i> 486 U. S. 847, 863, n. 11 (1988); <i>Klapprott</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 335 U. S. 601, 613 (1949) (opinion of Black, J.). The mere recitation of these provisions shows why we give little weight to respondent's appeal to the virtues of finality. That policy consideration, standing alone, is unpersuasive in the interpretation of a provision whose whole purpose is to make an exception to finality. The issue here is whether the text of Rule 60(b) itself, or of some other provision of law, limits its application in a manner relevant to the case before us.</p>\n<p>AEDPA did not expressly circumscribe the operation of Rule 60(b). (By contrast, AEDPA directly amended other provisions of the Federal Rules. See, <i>e. g.,</i> AEDPA, \u00a7 103, 110 Stat. 1218 (amending Fed. Rule App. Proc. 22).) The new habeas restrictions introduced by AEDPA are made indirectly relevant, however, by the fact that Rule 60(b), like the rest of the Rules of Civil Procedure, applies in habeas corpus proceedings under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254<sup>[3]</sup> only \"to the extent that [it is] not inconsistent with\" applicable federal statutory provisions and rules. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254 Rule 11; see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 81(a)(2). The relevant provisions of the AEDPA-amended habeas statutes, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(1)-(3), impose three requirements on second or successive habeas petitions: First, any claim that has already <span class=\"star-pagination\">*530</span> been adjudicated in a previous petition must be dismissed. \u00a7 2244(b)(1). Second, any claim that has <i>not</i> already been adjudicated must be dismissed unless it relies on either a new and retroactive rule of constitutional law or new facts showing a high probability of actual innocence. \u00a7 2244(b)(2). Third, before the district court may accept a successive petition for filing, the court of appeals must determine that it presents a claim not previously raised that is sufficient to meet \u00a7 2244(b)(2)'s new-rule or actual-innocence provisions. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). We proceed to consider whether these provisions limit the application of Rule 60(b) to the present case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>\"As a textual matter, \u00a7 2244(b) applies only where the court acts pursuant to a prisoner's `application'\" for a writ of habeas corpus. <i>Calderon</i> v. <i>Thompson,</i> 523 U. S. 538, 554 (1998). We therefore must decide whether a Rule 60(b) motion filed by a habeas petitioner is a \"habeas corpus application\" as the statute uses that term.</p>\n<p>Under \u00a7 2244(b), the first step of analysis is to determine whether a \"claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application\" was also \"presented in a prior application.\" If so, the claim must be dismissed; if not, the analysis proceeds to whether the claim satisfies one of two narrow exceptions. In either event, it is clear that for purposes of \u00a7 2244(b) an \"application\" for habeas relief is a filing that contains one or more \"claims.\" That definition is consistent with the use of the term \"application\" in the other habeas statutes in chapter 153 of title 28. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Woodford</i> v. <i>Garceau,</i> 538 U. S. 202, 207 (2003) (for purposes of \u00a7 2254(d), an application for habeas corpus relief is a filing that seeks \"an adjudication on the <i>merits</i> of the petitioner's claims\"). These statutes, and our own decisions, make clear that a \"claim\" as used in \u00a7 2244(b) is an asserted federal basis for relief from a state court's judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p>In some instances, a Rule 60(b) motion will contain one or more \"claims.\" For example, it might straightforwardly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*531</span> assert that owing to \"excusable neglect,\" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b)(1), the movant's habeas petition had omitted a claim of constitutional error, and seek leave to present that claim. Cf. <i>Harris</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 367 F. 3d 74, 80-81 (CA2 2004) (petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion sought relief from judgment because habeas counsel had failed to raise a Sixth Amendment claim). Similarly, a motion might seek leave to present \"newly discovered evidence,\" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b)(2), in support of a claim previously denied. <i>E. g., </i><i>Rodwell</i> v. <i>Pepe,</i> 324 F. 3d 66, 69 (CA1 2003). Or a motion might contend that a subsequent change in substantive law is a \"reason justifying relief,\" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b)(6), from the previous denial of a claim. <i>E. g., </i><i>Dunlap</i> v. <i>Litscher,</i> 301 F. 3d 873, 876 (CA7 2002). Virtually every Court of Appeals to consider the question has held that such a pleading, although labeled a Rule 60(b) motion, is in substance a successive habeas petition and should be treated accordingly. <i>E. g., </i><i>Rodwell, supra,</i> at 71-72; <i>Dunlap, supra,</i> at 876.</p>\n<p>We think those holdings are correct. A habeas petitioner's filing that seeks vindication of such a claim is, if not in substance a \"habeas corpus application,\" at least similar enough that failing to subject it to the same requirements would be \"inconsistent with\" the statute. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254 Rule 11. Using Rule 60(b) to present new claims for relief from a state court's judgment of conviction\u0097even claims couched in the language of a true Rule 60(b) motion\u0097circumvents AEDPA's requirement that a new claim be dismissed unless it relies on either a new rule of constitutional law or newly discovered facts. \u00a7 2244(b)(2). The same is true of a Rule 60(b)(2) motion presenting new evidence in support of a claim already litigated: Even assuming that reliance on a new factual predicate causes that motion to escape \u00a7 2244(b)(1)'s prohibition of claims \"presented in a prior application,\" \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B) requires a more convincing factual showing than does Rule 60(b). Likewise, a Rule 60(b) motion based on a purported change in the substantive law governing the claim could be used to circumvent \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(A)'s <span class=\"star-pagination\">*532</span> dictate that the only new law on which a successive petition may rely is \"a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\" In addition to the substantive conflict with AEDPA standards, in each of these three examples use of Rule 60(b) would impermissibly circumvent the requirement that a successive habeas petition be precertified by the court of appeals as falling within an exception to the successive-petition bar. \u00a7 2244(b)(3).</p>\n<p>In most cases, determining whether a Rule 60(b) motion advances one or more \"claims\" will be relatively simple. A motion that seeks to add a new ground for relief, as in <i>Harris, supra,</i> will of course qualify. A motion can also be said to bring a \"claim\" if it attacks the federal court's previous resolution of a claim <i>on the merits,</i><sup>[4]</sup> since alleging that the court erred in denying habeas relief on the merits is effectively indistinguishable from alleging that the movant is, under the substantive provisions of the statutes, entitled to habeas relief. That is not the case, however, when a Rule 60(b) motion attacks, not the substance of the federal court's resolution of a claim on the merits, but some defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*533</span> B</h2>\n<p>When no \"claim\" is presented, there is no basis for contending that the Rule 60(b) motion should be treated like a habeas corpus application. If neither the motion itself nor the federal judgment from which it seeks relief substantively addresses federal grounds for setting aside the movant's state conviction, allowing the motion to proceed as denominated creates no inconsistency with the habeas statute or rules. Petitioner's motion in the present case, which alleges that the federal courts misapplied the federal statute of limitations set out in \u00a7 2244(d), fits this description.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Like the Court of Appeals, respondent relies heavily on our decision in <i>Calderon</i> v. <i>Thompson,</i> 523 U. S. 538 (1998). In that case we reversed the Ninth Circuit's decision to recall its mandate and reconsider the denial of Thompson's first federal habeas petition; the recall was, we held, an abuse of discretion because of its inconsistency with the policies embodied in AEDPA. <i>Id.,</i> at 554-559. Analogizing an appellate court's recall of its mandate to a district court's grant of relief from judgment, the Eleventh Circuit thought that <i>Calderon</i>'s disposition applied to Rule 60(b). 366 F. 3d, at 1272-1277. We think otherwise. To begin with, as the opinion said, compliance with the actual text of AEDPA's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*534</span> successive-petition provision was not at issue in <i>Calderon</i>\u0097 because the Court of Appeals considered only the claims and evidence presented in Thompson's first federal habeas petition. 523 U. S., at 554. <i>Calderon</i> did state, however, that \"a prisoner's motion to recall the mandate <i>on the basis of the merits</i> of the underlying decision can be regarded as a second or successive application.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 553 (emphasis added). But that is entirely consonant with the proposition that a Rule 60(b) motion that seeks to revisit the federal court's denial <i>on the merits</i> of a claim for relief should be treated as a successive habeas petition. The problem for respondent is that this case does not present a revisitation <i>of the merits.</i> The motion here, like some other Rule 60(b) motions in \u00a7 2254 cases, confines itself not only to the first federal habeas petition, but to a nonmerits aspect of the first federal habeas proceeding. Nothing in <i>Calderon</i> suggests that entertaining such a filing is \"inconsistent with\" AEDPA.</p>\n<p>Rule 60(b) has an unquestionably valid role to play in habeas cases. The Rule is often used to relieve parties from the effect of a default judgment mistakenly entered against them, <i>e. g., </i><i>Klapprott,</i> 335 U. S., at 615 (opinion of Black, J.), a function as legitimate in habeas cases as in run-of-the-mine civil cases. The Rule also preserves parties' opportunity to obtain vacatur of a judgment that is void for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction\u0097a consideration just as valid in habeas cases as in any other, since absence of jurisdiction altogether deprives a federal court of the power to adjudicate the rights of the parties. <i>Steel Co.</i> v. <i>Citizens for Better Environment,</i> 523 U. S. 83, 94, 101 (1998). In some instances, we may note, it is the State, not the habeas petitioner, that seeks to use Rule 60(b), to reopen a habeas judgment <i>granting</i> the writ. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Ritter</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> 811 F. 2d 1398, 1400 (CA11 1987).</p>\n<p>Moreover, several characteristics of a Rule 60(b) motion limit the friction between the Rule and the successive-petition prohibitions of AEDPA, ensuring that our harmonization of the two will not expose federal courts to an avalanche <span class=\"star-pagination\">*535</span> of frivolous postjudgment motions. First, Rule 60(b) contains its own limitations, such as the requirement that the motion \"be made within a reasonable time\" and the more specific 1-year deadline for asserting three of the most open-ended grounds of relief (excusable neglect, newly discovered evidence, and fraud). Second, our cases have required a movant seeking relief under Rule 60(b)(6) to show \"extraordinary circumstances\" justifying the reopening of a final judgment. <i>Ackermann</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 340 U. S. 193, 199 (1950); accord, <i>id.,</i> at 202; <i>Liljeberg,</i> 486 U. S., at 864; <i>id.,</i> at 873 (REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting) (\"This very strict interpretation of Rule 60(b) is essential if the finality of judgments is to be preserved\"). Such circumstances will rarely occur in the habeas context. Third, Rule 60(b) proceedings are subject to only limited and deferential appellate review. <i>Browder</i> v. <i>Director, Dept. of Corrections of Ill.,</i> 434 U. S. 257, 263, n. 7 (1978). Many Courts of Appeals have construed 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2253 to impose an additional limitation on appellate review by requiring a habeas petitioner to obtain a COA as a prerequisite to appealing the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>Because petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion challenges only the District Court's previous ruling on the AEDPA statute of limitations, it is not the equivalent of a successive habeas <span class=\"star-pagination\">*536</span> petition. The Eleventh Circuit therefore erred in holding that petitioner did not qualify even to seek Rule 60(b) relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Although the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning is inconsistent with our holding today, we nonetheless affirm its denial of petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p>Petitioner's only ground for reopening the judgment denying his first federal habeas petition is that our decision in <i>Artuz</i> showed the error of the District Court's statute-of-limitations ruling. We assume for present purposes that the District Court's ruling was incorrect.<sup>[8]</sup> As we noted above, however, relief under Rule 60(b)(6)\u0097the only subsection petitioner invokes\u0097requires a showing of \"extraordinary circumstances.\" Petitioner contends that <i>Artuz</i>'s change in the interpretation of the AEDPA statute of limitations meets this description. We do not agree. The District Court's interpretation was by all appearances correct under the Eleventh Circuit's then-prevailing interpretation of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). It is hardly extraordinary that subsequently, after petitioner's case was no longer pending, this Court arrived at a different interpretation. Although our constructions of federal statutes customarily apply to all cases then pending on direct review, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Harper</i> v. <i>Virginia Dept. of Taxation,</i> 509 U. S. 86, 97 (1993), not every interpretation of the federal statutes setting forth the requirements for habeas provides cause for reopening cases long since final.<sup>[9]</sup> If <i>Artuz</i> justified reopening long-ago dismissals <span class=\"star-pagination\">*537</span> based on a lower court's unduly parsimonious interpretation of \u00a7 2244(d)(2), then <i>Pace</i> v. <i>DiGuglielmo,</i> 544 U. S. 408 (2005), would justify reopening long-ago grants of habeas relief based on a lower court's unduly <i>generous</i> interpretation of the same tolling provision.</p>\n<p>The change in the law worked by <i>Artuz</i> is all the less extraordinary in petitioner's case, because of his lack of diligence in pursuing review of the statute-of-limitations issue. At the time <i>Artuz</i> was decided, petitioner had abandoned any attempt to seek review of the District Court's decision on this statute-of-limitations issue. Although the District Court relied on Eleventh Circuit precedent holding that a state postconviction application is not \"properly filed\" if it is procedurally defaulted, and although that precedent was at odds with the rule in several other Circuits, petitioner neither raised that issue in his application for a COA, nor filed a petition for rehearing of the Eleventh Circuit's denial of a COA, nor sought certiorari review of that denial.<sup>[10]</sup> This lack of diligence confirms that <i>Artuz</i> is not an extraordinary circumstance justifying relief from the judgment in petitioner's case. Indeed, in one of the cases in which we explained Rule 60(b)(6)'s extraordinary-circumstances requirement, the movant had failed to appeal an adverse ruling by the District Court, whereas another party to the same judgment had <span class=\"star-pagination\">*538</span> appealed and won reversal. <i>Ackermann,</i> 340 U. S., at 195. Some years later, the petitioner sought Rule 60(b) relief, which the District Court denied. We affirmed the denial of Rule 60(b) relief, noting that the movant's decision not to appeal had been free and voluntary, although the favorable ruling in the companion case made it appear mistaken in hindsight. See <i>id.,</i> at 198.</p>\n<p>Under the Rule 60(b) standards that properly govern petitioner's motion, the District Court was correct to deny relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>We hold that a Rule 60(b)(6) motion in a \u00a7 2254 case is not to be treated as a successive habeas petition if it does not assert, or reassert, claims of error in the movant's state conviction. A motion that, like petitioner's, challenges only the District Court's failure to reach the merits does not warrant such treatment, and can therefore be ruled upon by the District Court without precertification by the Court of Appeals pursuant to \u00a7 2244(b)(3). In this case, however, petitioner's Rule 60(b)(6) motion fails to set forth an \"extraordinary circumstance\" justifying relief. For that reason, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER, concurring.</p>\n<p>The majority explains that a proper Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) motion \"attacks, not the substance of the federal court's resolution of a claim on the merits, but some defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 532. This is consistent with Judge Tjoflat's description of the standard in his opinion below, see 366 F. 3d 1253, 1297 (CA11 2004) (specially concurring in part and dissenting in part), and I agree with it. I fear that other language in the majority's opinion, especially its discussion of the significance of the word \"claim,\" could be taken to imply a different <span class=\"star-pagination\">*539</span> standard, with which I would disagree. With that qualification, I join the majority's opinion.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The most significant aspect of today's decision is the Court's unanimous rejection of the view that all postjudgment motions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) except those alleging fraud under Rule 60(b)(3) should be treated as second or successive habeas corpus petitions. Not only do I agree with that holding, I believe that we should have more promptly made clear that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) and Rule 60(b) can coexist in harmony. See <i>Abdur'Rahman</i> v. <i>Bell,</i> 537 U. S. 88, 90 (2002) (STEVENS, J., dissenting from dismissal of certiorari as improvidently granted).</p>\n<p>As the Court recognizes, whether a Rule 60(b) motion may proceed in the habeas context depends on the nature of the relief the motion seeks. See <i>ante,</i> at 533.<sup>[1]</sup> Given the substance of petitioner's motion, I agree with the Court that this was a \"true\" Rule 60(b) motion and that the District Court and the Court of Appeals therefore erred in treating it as a successive habeas petition. And while I also agree with much of the Court's reasoning in Parts I and II of its opinion, I believe the Court goes too far in commenting on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*540</span> issues that are not directly before us and that have not been fully briefed. See, <i>e. g., ante,</i> at 530-532 (discussing various Court of Appeals cases). My main disagreement, however, pertains to Part III of the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p>The Court reaches beyond the question on which we granted certiorari (whether petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion should be treated as a successive habeas petition) and adjudicates the merits of that motion. In my judgment, however, \"correct procedure requires that the merits of the Rule 60(b) motion be addressed in the first instance by the District Court.\" <i>Abdur'Rahman,</i> 537 U. S., at 97 (Stevens, J., dissenting). A district court considering a Rule 60(b) motion will often take into account a variety of factors in addition to the specific ground given for reopening the judgment. These factors include the diligence of the movant, the probable merit of the movant's underlying claims, the opposing party's reliance interests in the finality of the judgment, and other equitable considerations. See 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2857 (2d ed. 1995 and Supp. 2004); see <i>ibid.</i> (noting that appellate courts will reverse a district court's decision only for an abuse of discretion); <i>Plaut</i> v. <i>Spendthrift Farm, Inc.,</i> 514 U. S. 211, 233-234 (1995) (Rule 60(b) \"reflects and confirms the courts' own inherent and discretionary power, `firmly established in English practice long before the foundation of our Republic,' to set aside a judgment whose enforcement would work inequity\"). In light of the equitable, often fact-intensive nature of the Rule 60(b) inquiry, it is inappropriate for an appellate court to undertake it in the first instance. This is especially so in this case, in which both the briefing and the record before us are insufficient with regard to the merits issue.</p>\n<p>Orderly procedure aside, the Court's truncated analysis is unsatisfactory. At least in some circumstances, a supervening change in AEDPA procedural law can be the kind of \"extraordinary circumstanc[e],\" <i>Ackermann</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*541</span> 340 U. S. 193, 199 (1950), that constitutes a \"reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment\" within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(6). In this case, the District Court dismissed petitioner's habeas petition as time barred after concluding that his second motion for state postconviction relief did not toll AEDPA's statute of limitations. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244(d). After that judgment became final, however, we decided <i>Artuz</i> v. <i>Bennett,</i> 531 U. S. 4 (2000), which made clear that the District Court's ruling on tolling was erroneous and that the habeas petition should therefore not have been dismissed.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the Court underestimates the significance of the fact that petitioner was effectively shut out of federal court\u0097without any adjudication of the merits of his claims\u0097 because of a procedural ruling that was later shown to be flatly mistaken. As we have stressed, \"[d]ismissal of a <i>first</i> federal habeas petition is a particularly serious matter, for that dismissal denies the petitioner the protections of the Great Writ entirely, risking injury to an important interest in human liberty.\" <i>Lonchar</i> v. <i>Thomas,</i> 517 U. S. 314, 324 (1996); see also <i>Slack</i> v. <i>McDaniel,</i> 529 U. S. 473, 483 (2000) (\"The writ of habeas corpus plays a vital role in protecting constitutional rights\"). When a habeas petition has been dismissed on a clearly defective procedural ground, the State can hardly claim a legitimate interest in the finality of that judgment. Indeed, the State has experienced a windfall, while the state prisoner has been deprived\u0097contrary to congressional intent\u0097of his valuable right to one full round of federal habeas review.</p>\n<p>While this type of supervening change in procedural law may not alone warrant the reopening of a habeas judgment, there may be special factors that allow a prisoner to satisfy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*542</span> the high standard of Rule 60(b)(6). For instance, when a prisoner has shown reasonable diligence in seeking relief based on a change in procedural law, and when that prisoner can show that there is probable merit to his underlying claims, it would be well in keeping with a district court's discretion under Rule 60(b)(6) for that court to reopen the habeas judgment and give the prisoner the one fair shot at habeas review that Congress intended that he have. After all, we have consistently recognized that Rule 60(b)(6) \"provides courts with authority `adequate to enable them to vacate judgments whenever such action is appropriate to accomplish justice.'\" <i>Liljeberg</i> v. <i>Health Services Acquisition Corp.,</i> 486 U. S. 847, 864 (1988) (quoting <i>Klapprott</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 335 U. S. 601, 614-615 (1949)). Here, petitioner, who is serving a 99-year term in Florida prison, filed his Rule 60(b) motion approximately eight months after this Court's decision in <i>Artuz.</i> A district court could reasonably conclude that this period reveals no lack of diligence on the part of an incarcerated <i>pro se</i> litigant.<sup>[3]</sup> And while we have received scant briefing on the probable merit of his petition, his allegation\u0097that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because it was based on grossly inaccurate advice about the actual time he would serve in prison\u0097at least states a colorable claim of a constitutional violation. See <i>Finch</i> v. <i>Vaughn,</i> 67 F. 3d 909 (CA11 1995); see also <i>Mabry</i> v. <i>Johnson,</i> 467 U. S. 504 (1984).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court relies on petitioner's supposed lack of diligence in pursuing review of the District Court's initial statute-of-limitations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*543</span> ruling. See <i>ante,</i> at 537. In fact, petitioner did appeal the District Court's ruling, which the Court of Appeals correctly interpreted as a request for a certificate of appealability (COA).<sup>[5]</sup> As for petitioner's failure to seek rehearing or certiorari, he alleged in his Rule 60(b) motion, App. 16, and again in his reply brief, that he filed a timely petition for rehearing on April 18, 2000, but that the clerk of the Court of Appeals returned the motion unfiled, \"explaining, erroneously, that his appeal was dismissed and closed on October 28, 1999.\" Reply Brief for Petitioner 13 (emphasis deleted). According to petitioner, \"[t]his official misinformation carried the weight of a court decision and was enough to convince a <i>pro se</i> litigant (and some lawyers) that the 90-day window for filing a certiorari petition expired, as well.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The State, however, represents that petitioner erroneously filed the petition for rehearing under the case number of an earlier, dismissed appeal. Brief for Respondent 4. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*544</span> I do not know how to resolve these allegations, but this only highlights the propriety of a remand. Even on the State's version of events, petitioner's attempt at filing for rehearing is proof of diligence on his part.</p>\n<p>Putting these allegations aside, the Court's reasoning is too parsimonious. While petitioner could have shown even greater diligence by seeking rehearing for a second time and then filing for certiorari, we have never held <i>pro se</i> prisoners to the standards of counseled litigants. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Haines</i> v. <i>Kerner,</i> 404 U. S. 519 (1972) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> Indeed, petitioner's situation contrasts dramatically with that of the movant in the case the Court relies on, <i>Ackermann</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 340 U. S. 193 (1950). See <i>ante,</i> at 537-538. In upholding the denial of Rule 60(b)(6) relief in <i>Ackermann,</i> the Court put great emphasis on the fact that the movant had the benefit of paid counsel and that, for much of the relevant period, he was not detained, but rather enjoyed \"freedom of movement and action,\" 340 U. S., at 201.<sup>[6]</sup> In any event, I believe that our rules governing prisoner litigation should favor a policy of repose rather than a policy that encourages multiple filings with a low probability of success.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*545</span> Accordingly, I agree with the Court's conclusion that petitioner filed a \"true\" Rule 60(b) motion. I respectfully dissent, however, because of the Court's decision to rule on the merits of the motion in the first instance.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers by <i>Joshua L.

Scheidegger.</i></p>\n<p>[1]  Although the title \"Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment\" suggests that petitioner was relying on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e), the substance of the motion made clear that petitioner sought relief under Rule 60(b)(6).</p>\n<p>[2]  Rule 60(b) provides in relevant part:\n</p>\n<p>\"On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party . . . from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud ..., misrepresentation, or misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  In this case we consider only the extent to which Rule 60(b) applies to habeas proceedings under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254, which governs federal habeas relief for prisoners convicted in state court. Federal prisoners generally seek postconviction relief under \u00a7 2255, which contains its own provision governing second or successive applications. Although that portion of \u00a7 2255 is similar to, and refers to, the statutory subsection applicable to second or successive \u00a7 2254 petitions, it is not identical. Accordingly, we limit our consideration to \u00a7 2254 cases.</p>\n<p>[4]  The term \"on the merits\" has multiple usages. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Semtek Int'l Inc.</i> v. <i>Lockheed Martin Corp.,</i> 531 U. S. 497, 501-503 (2001). We refer here to a determination that there exist or do not exist grounds entitling a petitioner to habeas corpus relief under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2254(a) and (d). When a movant asserts one of those grounds (or asserts that a previous ruling regarding one of those grounds was in error) he is making a habeas corpus claim. He is not doing so when he merely asserts that a previous ruling which precluded a merits determination was in error\u0097for example, a denial for such reasons as failure to exhaust, procedural default, or statute-of-limitations bar.</p>\n<p>[5]  Fraud on the federal habeas court is one example of such a defect. See generally <i>Rodriguez</i> v. <i>Mitchell,</i> 252 F. 3d 191, 199 (CA2 2001) (a witness's allegedly fraudulent basis for refusing to appear at a federal habeas hearing \"relate[d] to the integrity of the federal habeas proceeding, not to the integrity of the state criminal trial\"). We note that an attack based on the movant's own conduct, or his habeas counsel's omissions, see, <i>e. g., supra,</i> at 530-531, ordinarily does not go to the integrity of the proceedings, but in effect asks for a second chance to have the merits determined favorably.</p>\n<p>[6]  Petitioner notes that we held in <i>Slack</i> v. <i>McDaniel,</i> 529 U. S. 473 (2000), that when a petition is dismissed without prejudice as unexhausted, the refiled petition is not \"successive.\" He argues that, by parity of reasoning, his Rule 60(b) motion challenging the District Court dismissal of his petition on statute-of-limitations grounds is not \"successive.\" If this argument is correct, petitioner would be able to file not just a Rule 60(b) motion, but a full-blown habeas petition, without running afoul of \u00a7 2244(b). But see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Murray</i> v. <i>Greiner,</i> 394 F. 3d 78, 81 (CA2 2005). We need not consider this contention, however, because we conclude that petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion is not subject to the limitations applicable to habeas petitions.</p>\n<p>[7]  See <i>Reid</i> v. <i>Angelone,</i> 369 F. 3d 363, 369, n. 2 (CA4 2004) (citing cases); 366 F. 3d 1253, 1263 (CA11 2004) (case below); cf. <i>Langford</i> v. <i>Day,</i> 134 F. 3d 1381, 1382 (CA9 1998) (before AEDPA, a certificate of probable cause was a prerequisite to appealing the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion in a habeas case); <i>Reid, supra,</i> at 368 (same). But see <i>Dunn</i> v. <i>Cockrell,</i> 302 F. 3d 491, 492 (CA5 2002); 366 F. 3d, at 1298-1300 (Tjoflat, J., specially concurring in part and dissenting in part). Although we do not decide in this case whether this construction of \u00a7 2253 is correct (the Eleventh Circuit granted petitioner a COA), the COA requirement appears to be a more plausible and effective screening requirement, with sounder basis in the statute, than the near-absolute bar imposed here by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>[8]  Although respondent contends that petitioner's motion for state postconviction relief was untimely, and that the District Court's denial of statutory tolling was therefore correct under <i>Pace</i> v. <i>DiGuglielmo,</i> 544 U. S. 408 (2005), the Florida courts made no reference to untimeliness in dismissing petitioner's motion.</p>\n<p>[9]  A change in the interpretation of a <i>substantive</i> statute may have consequences for cases that have already reached final judgment, particularly in the criminal context. See <i>Bousley</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 523 U. S. 614, 619-621 (1998); cf. <i>Fiore</i> v. <i>White,</i> 531 U. S. 225, 228-229 (2001) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>[10]  We granted review to resolve the conflict over the interpretation of \"properly filed\" on April 17, 2000, only eight days after the Eleventh Circuit denied petitioner a COA and well within the 90-day period in which petitioner could have sought certiorari. <i>Artuz</i> v. <i>Bennett,</i> 529 U. S. 1065. Whether or not petitioner was aware that the issue was pending before us, see <i>post,</i> at 544-545, n. 7 (STEVENS, J., dissenting), it is indisputable that had he but filed a petition raising the statute-of-limitations argument he now advances, we would surely have granted him the reconsideration in light of <i>Artuz</i> v. <i>Bennett,</i> 531 U. S. 4 (2000), that he later sought in his Rule 60(b) motion. See, <i>e. g., Brown</i> v. <i>Moore,</i> 532 U. S. 968 (2001) (granting a <i>pro se</i> petition for certiorari, vacating the Eleventh Circuit's judgment denying a COA, and remanding for reconsideration in light of <i>Artuz,</i> 531 U. S. 4).</p>\n<p>[1]  Under the First Circuit's useful formulation, which was invoked by Judge Tjoflat's dissenting opinion below, \"[w]hen the motion's factual predicate deals primarily with the constitutionality of the underlying state conviction or sentence, then the motion should be treated as a second or successive habeas petition. This situation should be distinguished from one in which the motion's factual predicate deals primarily with some irregularity or procedural defect in the procurement of the judgment denying relief. That is the classic function of a Rule 60(b) motion, and such a motion should be treated within the usual confines of Rule 60(b).\" <i>Rodwell</i> v. <i>Pepe,</i> 324 F. 3d 66, 70 (2003) (citation omitted); see also 366 F. 3d 1253, 1297 (CA11 2004) (Tjoflat, J., specially concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>[2]  Although the State contests this point in a footnote, see Brief for Respondent 40-41, n. 33, the Court rightly assumes that the District Court's decision was incorrect. See <i>ante,</i> at 536, and n. 8. If any doubt remains, it should be resolved by the District Court in the first instance.</p>\n<p>[3]  While Rule 60(b)(6) contains no specific time limitation on filing, it is worth noting that petitioner filed his motion within the strict 1-year limitation that applies to motions under Rules 60(b)(1)-(3).</p>\n<p>[4]  It is also worth noting that <i>Artuz</i> v. <i>Bennett,</i> 531 U. S. 4 (2000), was decided only seven months after petitioner's habeas judgment became final. In cases where significant time has elapsed between a habeas judgment and the relevant change in procedural law, it would be within a district court's discretion to leave such a judgment in repose.</p>\n<p>[5]  See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 22(b)(2) (\"If no express request for a certificate is filed, the notice of [appeal shall be deemed to constitute] a request addressed to the judges of the court of appeals\"). The procedural route that petitioner navigated was actually more complicated. After the Magistrate Judge initially recommended dismissal of the petition as time barred, petitioner filed an objection that raised a Third Circuit case, <i>Lovasz</i> v. <i>Vaughn,</i> 134 F. 3d 146 (1998), which was among the circuit cases that were later endorsed by <i>Artuz,</i> 531 U. S., at 8. The Magistrate's final report noted that the Eleventh Circuit had not addressed the relevant issue of tolling, and then proceeded to rely (oddly) on <i>Lovasz</i> to deny petitioner's claim. In my view, the citation to <i>Lovasz</i> and the Magistrate's acknowledgment that there was no Eleventh Circuit precedent on point provided a reasonable basis for the granting of a COA.\n</p>\n<p>In fact, on September 23, 1998, petitioner filed an application for a COA, and this application was granted by the District Court. The Court of Appeals, however, dismissed petitioner's appeal on October 28, 1999, and remanded the COA for a determination of which specific issues merited permission to appeal. On remand, petitioner filed a new application for a COA, but this time the District Court denied the request. Petitioner then filed a timely appeal, and the District Court granted his motion to proceed <i>in forma pauperis</i> on appeal. The Court of Appeals then declined to issue a COA and dismissed the appeal on April 6, 2000.</p>\n<p>[6]  <i>Ackermann</i> is further distinguishable in that it did not involve the sort of plain error of law that has been identified in this case. But even if <i>Ackermann</i> were not distinguishable, I would find the views expressed by Justices Black, Frankfurter, and Douglas in dissent, see 340 U. S., at 202 (opinion of Black, J.), more persuasive than those expressed by Justice Minton.</p>\n<p>[7]  A petition for certiorari seeking review of a denial of a COA has an objectively low chance of being granted. Such a decision is not thought to present a good vehicle for resolving legal issues, and error correction is a disfavored basis for granting review, particularly in noncapital cases. See generally this Court's Rule 10. As for the fact that this Court granted certiorari in <i>Artuz</i> eight days after the Eleventh Circuit denied petitioner a COA, it would be unrealistic to fault petitioner for failing to capitalize on this fortuity. In my experience, even lower courts and counseled litigants are often not aware of our grants of certiorari on issues that may be relevant to their current business. It would be particularly inappropriate to impose such a strict expectation on a <i>pro se</i> prisoner, particularly in the absence of any indication of when, given his circumstances in prison, he could have reasonably been expected to learn of our grant in <i>Artuz.</i></p>\n\n</div>",

Argued April 25, 2005\u2014Decided June 23, 2005\nPetitioner\u2019s federal habeas corpus petition was dismissed as time\n  barred when the District Court concluded that the federal limitations\n  period was not tolled while petitioner\u2019s motion for postconviction re-\n  lief was pending in state court. After petitioner abandoned his at-\n  tempt to seek review of the District Court\u2019s decision, this Court de-\n  cided that a state postconviction relief petition can toll the federal\n  statute of limitations even if, like petitioner\u2019s, the petition is ulti-\n  mately dismissed as procedurally barred. Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S.\n  4. Petitioner filed a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) motion\n  for relief from the judgment, which the District Court denied. The\n  Eleventh Circuit affirmed the denial, holding that the Rule 60(b) mo-\n  tion was in substance a second or successive habeas petition, which\n  under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n  (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(b), cannot be filed without precertifica-\n  tion by the court of appeals.\nHeld:\n    1. Because petitioner\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion challenged only the Dis-\n trict Court\u2019s previous ruling on AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations, it is\n not the equivalent of a successive habeas petition and can be ruled\n upon by the District Court without precertification by the Eleventh\n Circuit. Pp. 3\u201311.\n       (a) Rule 60(b) applies in \u00a72254 habeas proceedings only \u201cto the\n extent that [it is] not inconsistent with\u201d applicable federal statutes\n and rules. \u00a72254 Rule 11. Because \u00a72244(b) applies only where a\n court acts pursuant to a prisoner\u2019s \u201chabeas corpus application,\u201d the\n question here is whether a Rule 60(b) motion is such an application.\n The text of \u00a72244(b) shows that, for these purposes, a habeas applica-\n2                         GONZALEZ v. CROSBY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tion is a filing containing one or more \u201cclaims.\u201d Other federal habeas\n    statutes and this Court\u2019s decisions also make clear that a \u201cclaim\u201d is\n    an asserted federal basis for relief from a state-court conviction. If a\n    Rule 60(b) motion contains one or more \u201cclaims,\u201d the motion is, if not\n    in substance a \u201chabeas corpus application,\u201d at least similar enough\n    that failing to subject it to AEDPA\u2019s restrictions on successive habeas\n    petitions would be \u201cinconsistent with\u201d the statute. A Rule 60(b) mo-\n    tion can be said to bring a \u201cclaim\u201d if it seeks to add a new ground for\n    relief from the state conviction or attacks the federal court\u2019s previous\n    resolution of a claim on the merits, though not if it merely attacks a\n    defect in the federal habeas proceedings\u2019 integrity. Pp. 3\u20138.\n          (b) When no \u201cclaim\u201d is presented, there is no basis for contending\n    that a Rule 60(b) motion should be treated like a habeas petition. If\n    neither the motion itself nor the federal judgment from which it seeks\n    relief substantively addresses federal grounds for setting aside the\n    movant\u2019s state conviction, allowing the motion to proceed on its own\n    terms creates no inconsistency with the habeas statute or rules. Pe-\n    titioner\u2019s motion, which alleges that the federal courts misapplied\n    \u00a72244(d)\u2019s statute of limitations, fits this description. Nothing in\n    Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U. S. 538, suggests that entertaining a\n    filing confined to a nonmerits aspect of the first federal habeas pro-\n    ceeding is \u201cinconsistent with\u201d AEDPA. Pp. 8\u201311.\n       2. Under the proper Rule 60(b) standards, the District Court was\n    correct to deny relief. The change in the law worked by Artuz is not\n    an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d justifying relief under Rule 60(b)(6),\n    and it is made all the less extraordinary by the lack of diligence that\n    petitioner showed in seeking direct appellate review of the statute-of-\n    limitations issue.

The question presented is whether, in a\nhabeas case, such motions are subject to the additional\nrestrictions that apply to \u201csecond or successive\u201d habeas\ncorpus petitions under the provisions of the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) codified\nat 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(b).\n                              I\n   Petitioner Aurelio Gonzalez pleaded guilty in Florida\nCircuit Court to one count of robbery with a firearm. He\nfiled no appeal and began serving his 99-year sentence in\n1982. Some 12 years later, petitioner began to seek relief\nfrom his conviction. He filed two motions for state post-\nconviction relief, which the Florida courts denied. There-\nafter, in June 1997, petitioner filed a federal habeas peti-\ntion in the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, alleging that his guilty plea had not\n2                       GONZALEZ v. CROSBY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbeen entered knowingly and voluntarily.\n   Upon the State\u2019s motion, the District Court dismissed\npetitioner\u2019s habeas petition as barred by AEDPA\u2019s statute\nof limitations, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d). Under Eleventh Cir-\ncuit precedent, petitioner\u2019s filing deadline, absent tolling,\nwas April 23, 1997, one year after AEDPA\u2019s statute of\nlimitations took effect. Wilcox v. Florida Dept. of Correc-\ntions, 158 F. 3d 1209, 1211 (CA11 1998) (per curiam).\nAdopting a Magistrate Judge\u2019s recommendation, the Dis-\ntrict Court concluded that the limitations period was not\ntolled during the 163-day period while petitioner\u2019s second\nmotion for state postconviction relief was pending. Section\n2244(d)(2) tolls the statute of limitations during the pend-\nency of \u201cproperly filed\u201d applications only, and the District\nCourt thought petitioner\u2019s motion was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d\nbecause it was both untimely and successive. Without\ntolling, petitioner\u2019s federal habeas petition was two\nmonths late, so the District Court dismissed it as time\nbarred. A judge of the Eleventh Circuit denied a certifi-\ncate of appealability (COA) on April 6, 2000, and peti-\ntioner did not file for rehearing or review of that decision.\n   On November 7, 2000, we held in Artuz v. Bennett, 531\nU. S. 4, that an application for state postconviction relief\ncan be \u201cproperly filed\u201d even if the state courts dismiss it as\nprocedurally barred. See id., at 8\u20139. Almost nine months\nlater, petitioner filed in the District Court a pro se \u201cMotion\nto Amend or Alter Judgment,\u201d contending that the District\nCourt\u2019s time-bar ruling was incorrect under Artuz\u2019s con-\nstruction of \u00a72244(d), and invoking Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 60(b)(6), which permits a court to relieve a\nparty from the effect of a final judgment.1 The District\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Althoughthe title \u201cMotion to Alter or Amend Judgment\u201d suggests\nthat petitioner was relying on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e), the\nsubstance of the motion made clear that petitioner sought relief under\nRule 60(b)(6).\n                     Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt denied the motion, and petitioner appealed.\n   A judge of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\ngranted petitioner a COA, but a panel quashed the certifi-\ncate as improvidently granted. 317 F. 3d 1308, 1310, 1314\n(2003). The full court vacated that order and reheard the\ncase en banc. It granted petitioner a COA but held, by a\nvote of 7 to 4, that the District Court was correct to deny\nhis Rule 60(b) motion. The en banc majority determined\nthat petitioner\u2019s motion\u2014indeed, any postjudgment mo-\ntion under Rule 60(b) save one alleging fraud on the court\nunder Rule 60(b)(3)\u2014was in substance a second or succes-\nsive habeas corpus petition. 366 F. 3d 1253, 1278, 1281\u2013\n1282 (2004). A state prisoner may not file such a petition\nwithout precertification by the court of appeals that the\npetition meets certain stringent criteria. \u00a72244(b). Be-\ncause petitioner\u2019s motion did not satisfy these require-\nments, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed its denial. Id., at\n1282.\n   We granted certiorari. 543 U. S. __ (2005).\n                            II\n  Rule 60(b) allows a party to seek relief from a final\njudgment, and request reopening of his case, under a\nlimited set of circumstances including fraud, mistake, and\nnewly discovered evidence.2 Rule 60(b)(6), the particular\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Rule 60(b) provides in relevant part:\n\n\u201cOn motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a\nparty . . . from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following\nreasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2)\nnewly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been\ndiscovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud\n. . . , misrepresentation, or misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the\njudgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or\ndischarged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been re-\nversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judg-\nment should have prospective application; or (6) any other reason\njustifying relief from the operation of the judgment. The motion shall\n4                       GONZALEZ v. CROSBY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprovision under which petitioner brought his motion,\npermits reopening when the movant shows \u201cany . . . rea-\nson justifying relief from the operation of the judgment\u201d\nother than the more specific circumstances set out in\nRules 60(b)(1)\u2013(5). See Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisi-\ntion Corp., 486 U. S. 847, 863, n. 11 (1988); Klapprott v.\nUnited States, 335 U. S. 601, 613 (1949) (opinion of Black,\nJ.). The mere recitation of these provisions shows why we\ngive little weight to respondent\u2019s appeal to the virtues of\nfinality. That policy consideration, standing alone, is un-\npersuasive in the interpretation of a provision whose\nwhole purpose is to make an exception to finality. The\nissue here is whether the text of Rule 60(b) itself, or of\nsome other provision of law, limits its application in a\nmanner relevant to the case before us.\n   AEDPA did not expressly circumscribe the operation of\nRule 60(b). (By contrast, AEDPA directly amended other\nprovisions of the Federal Rules. See, e.g., AEDPA, \u00a7103,\n110 Stat. 1218 (amending Fed. Rule App. Proc. 22).) The\nnew habeas restrictions introduced by AEDPA are made\nindirectly relevant, however, by the fact that Rule 60(b),\nlike the rest of the Rules of Civil Procedure, applies in\nhabeas corpus proceedings under 28 U. S. C. \u00a722543 only\n\u201cto the extent that [it is] not inconsistent with\u201d applicable\nfederal statutory provisions and rules. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254\nRule 11; see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 81(a)(2). The relevant\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nbe made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not\nmore than one year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was\nentered or taken.\u201d\n   3 In this case we consider only the extent to which Rule 60(b) applies\n\nto habeas proceedings under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254, which governs federal\nhabeas relief for prisoners convicted in state court. Federal prisoners\ngenerally seek postconviction relief under \u00a72255, which contains its\nown provision governing second or successive applications. Although\nthat portion of \u00a72255 is similar to, and refers to, the statutory subsec-\ntion applicable to second or successive \u00a72254 petitions, it is not identi-\ncal. Accordingly, we limit our consideration to \u00a72254 cases.\n                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprovisions of the AEDPA-amended habeas statutes, 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72244(b)(1)\u2013(3), impose three requirements on\nsecond or successive habeas petitions: First, any claim\nthat has already been adjudicated in a previous petition\nmust be dismissed. \u00a72244(b)(1). Second, any claim that\nhas not already been adjudicated must be dismissed\nunless it relies on either a new and retroactive rule of\nconstitutional law or new facts showing a high probability\nof actual innocence. \u00a72244(b)(2). Third, before the district\ncourt may accept a successive petition for filing, the court\nof appeals must determine that it presents a claim not\npreviously raised that is sufficient to meet \u00a72244(b)(2)\u2019s\nnew-rule or actual-innocence provisions. \u00a72244(b)(3). We\nproceed to consider whether these provisions limit the\napplication of Rule 60(b) to the present case.\n                              A\n   \u201cAs a textual matter, \u00a72244(b) applies only where the\ncourt acts pursuant to a prisoner\u2019s \u2018application\u2019 \u201d for a writ\nof habeas corpus. Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U. S. 538,\n554 (1998). We therefore must decide whether a Rule 60(b)\nmotion filed by a habeas petitioner is a \u201chabeas corpus\napplication\u201d as the statute uses that term.\n   Under \u00a72244(b), the first step of analysis is to determine\nwhether a \u201cclaim presented in a second or successive\nhabeas corpus application\u201d was also \u201cpresented in a prior\napplication.\u201d If so, the claim must be dismissed; if not, the\nanalysis proceeds to whether the claim satisfies one of two\nnarrow exceptions. In either event, it is clear that for\npurposes of \u00a72244(b) an \u201capplication\u201d for habeas relief is a\nfiling that contains one or more \u201cclaims.\u201d That definition\nis consistent with the use of the term \u201capplication\u201d in the\nother habeas statutes in chapter 153 of title 28. See, e.g.,\nWoodford v. Garceau, 538 U. S. 202, 207 (2003) (for pur-\nposes of \u00a72254(d), an application for habeas corpus relief is\na filing that seeks \u201can adjudication on the merits of the\n6                   GONZALEZ v. CROSBY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npetitioner\u2019s claims\u201d). These statutes, and our own deci-\nsions, make clear that a \u201cclaim\u201d as used in \u00a72244(b) is an\nasserted federal basis for relief from a state court\u2019s judg-\nment of conviction.\n   In some instances, a Rule 60(b) motion will contain one\nor more \u201cclaims.\u201d For example, it might straightforwardly\nassert that owing to \u201cexcusable neglect,\u201d Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 60(b)(1), the movant\u2019s habeas petition had omitted a\nclaim of constitutional error, and seek leave to present\nthat claim. Cf. Harris v. United States, 367 F. 3d 74, 80\u2013\n81 (CA2 2004) (petitioner\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion sought relief\nfrom judgment because habeas counsel had failed to raise\na Sixth Amendment claim). Similarly, a motion might\nseek leave to present \u201cnewly discovered evidence,\u201d Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 60(b)(2), in support of a claim previously\ndenied. E.g., Rodwell v. Pepe, 324 F. 3d 66, 69 (CA1 2003).\nOr a motion might contend that a subsequent change in\nsubstantive law is a \u201creason justifying relief,\u201d Fed. Rule\nCiv. Proc. 60(b)(6), from the previous denial of a claim.\nE.g., Dunlap v. Litscher, 301 F. 3d 873, 876 (CA7 2002).\nVirtually every Court of Appeals to consider the question\nhas held that such a pleading, although labeled a Rule\n60(b) motion, is in substance a successive habeas petition\nand should be treated accordingly. E.g., Rodwell, supra,\nat 71\u201372; Dunlap, supra, at 876.\n   We think those holdings are correct. A habeas peti-\ntioner\u2019s filing that seeks vindication of such a claim is, if\nnot in substance a \u201chabeas corpus application,\u201d at least\nsimilar enough that failing to subject it to the same re-\nquirements would be \u201cinconsistent with\u201d the statute. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254 Rule 11. Using Rule 60(b) to present new\nclaims for relief from a state court\u2019s judgment of convic-\ntion\u2014even claims couched in the language of a true Rule\n60(b) motion\u2014circumvents AEDPA\u2019s requirement that a\nnew claim be dismissed unless it relies on either a new\nrule of constitutional law or newly discovered facts.\n                     Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a72244(b)(2). The same is true of a Rule 60(b)(2) motion\npresenting new evidence in support of a claim already\nlitigated: even assuming that reliance on a new factual\npredicate causes that motion to escape \u00a72244(b)(1)\u2019s prohi-\nbition of claims \u201cpresented in a prior application,\u201d\n\u00a72244(b)(2)(B) requires a more convincing factual showing\nthan does Rule 60(b). Likewise, a Rule 60(b) motion based\non a purported change in the substantive law governing\nthe claim could be used to circumvent \u00a72244(b)(2)(A)\u2019s\ndictate that the only new law on which a successive peti-\ntion may rely is \u201ca new rule of constitutional law, made\nretroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme\nCourt, that was previously unavailable.\u201d In addition to\nthe substantive conflict with AEDPA standards, in each of\nthese three examples use of Rule 60(b) would impermissi-\nbly circumvent the requirement that a successive habeas\npetition be precertified by the court of appeals as falling\nwithin an exception to the successive-petition bar.\n\u00a72244(b)(3).\n   In most cases, determining whether a Rule 60(b) motion\nadvances one or more \u201cclaims\u201d will be relatively simple. A\nmotion that seeks to add a new ground for relief, as in\nHarris, supra, will of course qualify. A motion can also be\nsaid to bring a \u201cclaim\u201d if it attacks the federal court\u2019s\nprevious resolution of a claim on the merits,4 since alleging\nthat the court erred in denying habeas relief on the merits\nis effectively indistinguishable from alleging that the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The term \u201con the merits\u201d has multiple usages. See, e.g., Semtek Int\u2019l\n\nInc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531 U. S. 497, 501\u2013503 (2001). We refer\nhere to a determination that there exist or do not exist grounds enti-\ntling a petitioner to habeas corpus relief under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72254(a)\nand (d). When a movant asserts one of those grounds (or asserts that a\nprevious ruling regarding one of those grounds was in error) he is\nmaking a habeas corpus claim. He is not doing so when he merely\nasserts that a previous ruling which precluded a merits determination\nwas in error\u2014for example, a denial for such reasons as failure to\nexhaust, procedural default, or statute-of-limitations bar.\n8                        GONZALEZ v. CROSBY\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nmovant is, under the substantive provisions of the stat-\nutes, entitled to habeas relief. That is not the case, how-\never, when a Rule 60(b) motion attacks, not the substance\nof the federal court\u2019s resolution of a claim on the merits,\nbut some defect in the integrity of the federal habeas\nproceedings.5\n                             B\n   When no \u201cclaim\u201d is presented, there is no basis for con-\ntending that the Rule 60(b) motion should be treated like a\nhabeas corpus application. If neither the motion itself nor\nthe federal judgment from which it seeks relief substan-\ntively addresses federal grounds for setting aside the\nmovant\u2019s state conviction, allowing the motion to proceed\nas denominated creates no inconsistency with the habeas\nstatute or rules. Petitioner\u2019s motion in the present case,\nwhich alleges that the federal courts misapplied the fed-\neral statute of limitations set out in \u00a72244(d), fits this\ndescription.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Fraud on the federal habeas court is one example of such a defect.\n\nSee generally Rodriguez v. Mitchell, 252 F. 3d 191, 199 (CA2 2001) (a\nwitness\u2019s allegedly fraudulent basis for refusing to appear at a federal\nhabeas hearing \u201crelate[d] to the integrity of the federal habeas proceed-\ning, not to the integrity of the state criminal trial\u201d). We note that an\nattack based on the movant\u2019s own conduct, or his habeas counsel\u2019s\nomissions, see, e.g., supra, at 6, ordinarily does not go to the integrity of\nthe proceedings, but in effect asks for a second chance to have the\nmerits determined favorably.\n  6 Petitioner notes that we held in Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473\n\n(2000), that when a petition is dismissed without prejudice as unex-\nhausted, the refiled petition is not \u201csuccessive.\u201d He argues that, by\nparity of reasoning, his Rule 60(b) motion challenging the District\nCourt dismissal of his petition on statute-of-limitations grounds is not\n\u201csuccessive.\u201d If this argument is correct, petitioner would be able to file\nnot just a Rule 60(b) motion, but a full-blown habeas petition, without\nrunning afoul of \u00a72244(b). But see, e.g., Murray v. Greiner, 394 F. 3d\n78, 81 (CA2 2005). We need not consider this contention, however,\nbecause we conclude that petitioner\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion is not subject to\nthe limitations applicable to habeas petitions.\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Like the Court of Appeals, respondent relies heavily on\nour decision in Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U. S. 538\n(1998). In that case we reversed the Ninth Circuit\u2019s deci-\nsion to recall its mandate and reconsider the denial of\nThompson\u2019s first federal habeas petition; the recall was,\nwe held, an abuse of discretion because of its inconsistency\nwith the policies embodied in AEDPA. Id., at 554\u2013559.\nAnalogizing an appellate court\u2019s recall of its mandate to a\ndistrict court\u2019s grant of relief from judgment, the Eleventh\nCircuit thought that Calderon\u2019s disposition applied to Rule\n60(b). 366 F. 3d, at 1272\u20131277. We think otherwise. To\nbegin with, as the opinion said, compliance with the actual\ntext of AEDPA\u2019s successive-petition provision was not at\nissue in Calderon\u2014because the Court of Appeals consid-\nered only the claims and evidence presented in Thomp-\nson\u2019s first federal habeas petition. 523 U. S., at 554.\nCalderon did state, however, that \u201ca prisoner\u2019s motion to\nrecall the mandate on the basis of the merits of the under-\nlying decision can be regarded as a second or successive\napplication.\u201d Id., at 553 (emphasis added). But that is\nentirely consonant with the proposition that a Rule 60(b)\nmotion that seeks to revisit the federal court\u2019s denial on\nthe merits of a claim for relief should be treated as a suc-\ncessive habeas petition. The problem for respondent is\nthat this case does not present a revisitation of the merits.\nThe motion here, like some other Rule 60(b) motions in\n\u00a72254 cases, confines itself not only to the first federal\nhabeas petition, but to a nonmerits aspect of the first\nfederal habeas proceeding. Nothing in Calderon suggests\nthat entertaining such a filing is \u201cinconsistent with\u201d\nAEDPA.\n  Rule 60(b) has an unquestionably valid role to play in\nhabeas cases. The Rule is often used to relieve parties\nfrom the effect of a default judgment mistakenly entered\nagainst them, e.g., Klapprott, 335 U. S., at 615 (opinion of\nBlack, J.), a function as legitimate in habeas cases as in\n10                  GONZALEZ v. CROSBY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrun-of-the-mine civil cases. The Rule also preserves par-\nties\u2019 opportunity to obtain vacatur of a judgment that is\nvoid for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction\u2014a considera-\ntion just as valid in habeas cases as in any other, since\nabsence of jurisdiction altogether deprives a federal court\nof the power to adjudicate the rights of the parties. Steel\nCo. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 94, 101\n(1998). In some instances, we may note, it is the State, not\nthe habeas petitioner, that seeks to use Rule 60(b), to\nreopen a habeas judgment granting the writ. See, e.g.,\nRitter v. Smith, 811 F. 2d 1398, 1400 (CA11 1987).\n   Moreover, several characteristics of a Rule 60(b) motion\nlimit the friction between the Rule and the successive-\npetition prohibitions of AEDPA, ensuring that our har-\nmonization of the two will not expose federal courts to an\navalanche of frivolous postjudgment motions. First, Rule\n60(b) contains its own limitations, such as the require-\nment that the motion \u201cbe made within a reasonable time\u201d\nand the more specific 1-year deadline for asserting three of\nthe most open-ended grounds of relief (excusable neglect,\nnewly discovered evidence, and fraud). Second, our cases\nhave required a movant seeking relief under Rule 60(b)(6)\nto show \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d justifying the\nreopening of a final judgment. Ackermann v. United\nStates, 340 U. S. 193, 199 (1950); accord, id., at 202; Lilje-\nberg, 486 U. S., at 864; id., at 873 (REHNQUIST, C. J., dis-\nsenting) (\u201cThis very strict interpretation of Rule 60(b) is\nessential if the finality of judgments is to be preserved\u201d).\nSuch circumstances will rarely occur in the habeas context.\nThird, Rule 60(b) proceedings are subject to only limited and\ndeferential appellate review. Browder v. Director, Dept. of\nCorrections of Ill., 434 U. S. 257, 263, n. 7 (1978). Many\nCourts of Appeals have construed 28 U. S.

The Eleventh Circuit therefore erred in\nholding that petitioner did not qualify even to seek Rule\n60(b) relief.\n                             III\n  Although the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reasoning is inconsis-\ntent with our holding today, we nonetheless affirm its\ndenial of petitioner\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion.\n  Petitioner\u2019s only ground for reopening the judgment\ndenying his first federal habeas petition is that our deci-\nsion in Artuz showed the error of the District Court\u2019s\nstatute-of-limitations ruling.     We assume for present\npurposes that the District Court\u2019s ruling was incorrect.8\nAs we noted above, however, relief under Rule 60(b)(6)\u2014\nthe only subsection petitioner invokes\u2014requires a show-\ning of \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d Petitioner contends\nthat Artuz\u2019s change in the interpretation of the AEDPA\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 See Reid v. Angelone, 369 F. 3d 363, 369, n. 2 (CA4 2004) (citing\n\ncases); 366 F. 3d 1253, 1263 (CA11 2004) (case below); cf. Langford v.\nDay, 134 F. 3d 1381, 1382 (CA9 1998) (before AEDPA, a certificate of\nprobable cause was a prerequisite to appealing the denial of a 60(b)\nmotion in a habeas case); Reid, supra, at 368 (same). But see Dunn v.\nCockrell, 302 F. 3d 491, 492 (CA5 2002); 366 F. 3d, at 1298\u20131300\n(Tjoflat, J., specially concurring in part and dissenting in part). Al-\nthough we do not decide in this case whether this construction of \u00a72253\nis correct (the Eleventh Circuit granted petitioner a COA), the COA\nrequirement appears to be a more plausible and effective screening\nrequirement, with sounder basis in the statute, than the near-absolute\nbar imposed here by the Court of Appeals.\n  8 Although respondent contends that petitioner\u2019s motion for state\n\npostconviction relief was untimely, and that the District Court\u2019s denial\nof statutory tolling was therefore correct under Pace v. DiGuglielmo,\n544 U. S. __ (2005), the Florida courts made no reference to untimeli-\nness in dismissing petitioner\u2019s motion.\n12                     GONZALEZ v. CROSBY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute of limitations meets this description. We do not\nagree. The District Court\u2019s interpretation was by all\nappearances correct under the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s then-\nprevailing interpretation of 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(2). It is\nhardly extraordinary that subsequently, after petitioner\u2019s\ncase was no longer pending, this Court arrived at a differ-\nent interpretation. Although our constructions of federal\nstatutes customarily apply to all cases then pending on\ndirect review, see, e.g., Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxa-\ntion, 509 U. S. 86, 97 (1993), not every interpretation of the\nfederal statutes setting forth the requirements for habeas\nprovides cause for reopening cases long since final.9 If\nArtuz justified reopening long-ago dismissals based on a\nlower court\u2019s unduly parsimonious interpretation of\n\u00a72244(d)(2), then Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. __ (2005),\nwould justify reopening long-ago grants of habeas relief\nbased on a lower court\u2019s unduly generous interpretation of\nthe same tolling provision.\n   The change in the law worked by Artuz is all the less\nextraordinary in petitioner\u2019s case, because of his lack of\ndiligence in pursuing review of the statute-of-limitations\nissue. At the time Artuz was decided, petitioner had\nabandoned any attempt to seek review of the District\nCourt\u2019s decision on this statute-of-limitations issue. Al-\nthough the District Court relied on Eleventh Circuit\nprecedent holding that a state postconviction application\nis not \u201cproperly filed\u201d if it is procedurally defaulted, and\nalthough that precedent was at odds with the rule in\nseveral other Circuits, petitioner neither raised that issue\nin his application for a COA, nor filed a petition for re-\nhearing of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s denial of a COA, nor\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 A change in the interpretation of a substantive statute may have\n\nconsequences for cases that have already reached final judgment,\nparticularly in the criminal context. See Bousley v. United States, 523\nU. S. 614, 619\u2013621 (1998); cf. Fiore v. White, 531 U. S. 225, 228\u2013229\n(2001) (per curiam).\n                     Cite as: 545 U.

Indeed, in one of the cases in which we\nexplained Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s extraordinary-circumstances\nrequirement, the movant had failed to appeal an adverse\nruling by the District Court, whereas another party to the\nsame judgment had appealed and won reversal. Acker-\nmann, 340 U. S., at 195. Some years later, the petitioner\nsought Rule 60(b) relief, which the District Court denied.\nWe affirmed the denial of Rule 60(b) relief, noting that the\nmovant\u2019s decision not to appeal had been free and volun-\ntary, although the favorable ruling in the companion case\nmade it appear mistaken in hindsight. See id., at 198.\n   Under the Rule 60(b) standards that properly govern\npetitioner\u2019s motion, the District Court was correct to deny\nrelief.\n                        *    *     *\n  We hold that a Rule 60(b)(6) motion in a \u00a72254 case is\nnot to be treated as a successive habeas petition if it does\nnot assert, or reassert, claims of error in the movant\u2019s\nstate conviction. A motion that, like petitioner\u2019s, chal-\nlenges only the District Court\u2019s failure to reach the merits\ndoes not warrant such treatment, and can therefore be\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 We granted review to resolve the conflict over the interpretation of\n\n\u201cproperly filed\u201d on April 17, 2000, only eight days after the Eleventh\nCircuit denied petitioner a COA and well within the 90-day period in\nwhich petitioner could have sought certiorari. Artuz v. Bennett, 529\nU. S. 1065. Whether or not petitioner was aware that the issue was\npending before us, see post, at 7, n. 7 (STEVENS, J., dissenting), it is\nindisputable that had he but filed a petition raising the statute-of-\nlimitations argument he now advances, we would surely have granted\nhim the reconsideration in light of Artuz that he later sought in his Rule\n60(b) motion. See, e.g., Brown v. Moore, 532 U. S. 968 (2001) (granting a\npro se petition for certiorari, vacating the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judgment\ndenying a COA, and remanding for reconsideration in light of Artuz).\n14                  GONZALEZ v.

See Ab-\ndur\u2019Rahman v. Bell, 537 U. S. 88, 90 (2002) (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting from dismissal of certiorari as improvidently\ngranted).\n   As the Court recognizes, whether a Rule 60(b) motion\nmay proceed in the habeas context depends on the nature\nof the relief the motion seeks.

CROSBY\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nsubstance of petitioner\u2019s motion, I agree with the Court\nthat this was a \u201ctrue\u201d Rule 60(b) motion and that the\nDistrict Court and the Court of Appeals therefore erred in\ntreating it as a successive habeas petition. And while I\nalso agree with much of the Court\u2019s reasoning in Parts I\nand II of its opinion, I believe the Court goes too far in\ncommenting on issues that are not directly before us and\nthat have not been fully briefed. See, e.g., ante, at 6\u20137\n(discussing various court of appeals cases). My main\ndisagreement, however, pertains to Part III of the Court\u2019s\nopinion.\n   The Court reaches beyond the question on which we\ngranted certiorari (whether petitioner\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion\nshould be treated as a successive habeas petition) and\nadjudicates the merits of that motion. In my judgment,\nhowever, \u201ccorrect procedure requires that the merits of the\nRule 60(b) motion be addressed in the first instance by the\nDistrict Court.\u201d Abdur\u2019Rahman, 537 U. S., at 97\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting). A district court considering a\nRule 60(b) motion will often take into account a variety of\nfactors in addition to the specific ground given for reopen-\ning the judgment. These factors include the diligence of\nthe movant, the probable merit of the movant\u2019s underlying\nclaims, the opposing party\u2019s reliance interests in the final-\nity of the judgment, and other equitable considerations.\nSee 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice\nand Procedure \u00a72857 (2d ed. 1995 and Supp. 2004) see\nibid.

In light of the equitable, often fact-\nintensive nature of the Rule 60(b) inquiry, it is inappro-\npriate for an appellate court to undertake it in the first\ninstance. This is especially so in this case, in which both\nthe briefing and the record before us are insufficient with\nregard to the merits issue.\n   Orderly procedure aside, the Court\u2019s truncated analysis\nis unsatisfactory. At least in some circumstances, a su-\npervening change in AEDPA procedural law can be the\nkind of \u201cextraordinary circumstanc[e],\u201d Ackermann v.\nUnited States, 340 U. S. 193, 199 (1950), that constitutes a\n\u201creason justifying relief from the operation of the judg-\nment\u201d within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(6). In this case,\nthe District Court dismissed petitioner\u2019s habeas petition\nas time barred after concluding that his second motion for\nstate postconviction relief did not toll AEDPA\u2019s statute of\nlimitations. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d). After that judgment\nbecame final, however, we decided Artuz v. Bennett, 531\nU. S. 4 (2000), which made clear that the District Court\u2019s\nruling on tolling was erroneous and that the habeas peti-\ntion should therefore not have been dismissed.2\n   Unfortunately, the Court underestimates the signifi-\ncance of the fact that petitioner was effectively shut out of\nfederal court\u2014without any adjudication of the merits of\nhis claims\u2014because of a procedural ruling that was later\nshown to be flatly mistaken.         As we have stressed,\n\u201c[d]ismissal of a first federal habeas petition is a particu-\nlarly serious matter, for that dismissal denies the peti-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Although the State contests this point in a footnote, see Brief for\n\nRespondent 40\u201341, n. 33, the Court rightly assumes that the District\nCourt\u2019s decision was incorrect. See ante, at 11, and n. 8. If any doubt\nremains, it should be resolved by the District Court in the first\ninstance.\n4                   GONZALEZ v.

When a habeas petition has been dismissed on a\nclearly defective procedural ground, the State can hardly\nclaim a legitimate interest in the finality of that judgment.\nIndeed, the State has experienced a windfall, while the\nstate prisoner has been deprived\u2014contrary to congres-\nsional intent\u2014of his valuable right to one full round of\nfederal habeas review.\n   While this type of supervening change in procedural law\nmay not alone warrant the reopening of a habeas judg-\nment, there may be special factors that allow a prisoner to\nsatisfy the high standard of Rule 60(b)(6). For instance,\nwhen a prisoner has shown reasonable diligence in seek-\ning relief based on a change in procedural law, and when\nthat prisoner can show that there is probable merit to his\nunderlying claims, it would be well in keeping with a\ndistrict court\u2019s discretion under Rule 60(b)(6) for that court\nto reopen the habeas judgment and give the prisoner the\none fair shot at habeas review that Congress intended that\nhe have. After all, we have consistently recognized that\nRule 60(b)(6) \u201cprovides courts with authority \u2018adequate to\nenable them to vacate judgments whenever such action is\nappropriate to accomplish justice.\u2019 \u201d Liljeberg v.

Here, petitioner, who is serving a 99-year term in\nFlorida prison, filed his Rule 60(b) motion approximately\neight months after this Court\u2019s decision in Artuz.

See Finch v. Vaughn,\n67 F. 3d 909 (CA11 1995); see also Mabry v. Johnson, 467\nU. S. 504 (1984).4\n  The Court relies on petitioner\u2019s supposed lack of dili-\ngence in pursuing review of the District Court\u2019s initial\nstatute-of-limitations ruling.   See ante, at 12. In fact,\npetitioner did appeal the District Court\u2019s ruling, which the\nCourt of Appeals correctly interpreted as a request for a\ncertificate of appealability (COA).5 As for petitioner\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 While    Rule 60(b)(6) contains no specific time limitation on filing, it\nis worth noting that petitioner filed his motion within the strict 1-year\nlimitation that applies to motions under Rules 60(b)(1)\u2013(3).\n   4 It is also worth noting that Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S. 4 (2000), was\n\ndecided only seven months after petitioner\u2019s habeas judgment became\nfinal. In cases where significant time has elapsed between a habeas\njudgment and the relevant change in procedural law, it would be within\na district court\u2019s discretion to leave such a judgment in repose.\n   5 See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 22(b)(2) (\u201cIf no express request for a cer-\n\ntificate is filed, the notice of [appeal shall be deemed to constitute] a\nrequest addressed to the judges of the court of appeals\u201d). The proce-\ndural route that petitioner navigated was actually more complicated.\nAfter the Magistrate Judge initially recommended dismissal of the\npetition as time barred, petitioner filed an objection that raised a Third\nCircuit case, Lovasz v. Vaughn, 134 F. 3d 146 (1998), which was among\nthe circuit cases that was later endorsed by Artuz, 531 U. S., at 8. The\nMagistrate\u2019s final report noted that the Eleventh Circuit had not\naddressed the relevant issue of tolling, and then proceeded to rely\n(oddly) on Lovasz to deny petitioner\u2019s claim. In my view, the citation to\nLovasz and the Magistrate\u2019s acknowledgment that there was no Elev-\nenth Circuit precedent on point provided a reasonable basis for the\ngranting of a COA.\n   In fact, on September 23, 1998, petitioner filed an application for a\nCOA, and this application was granted by the District Court. The\nCourt of Appeals, however, dismissed petitioner\u2019s appeal on October 28,\n6                      GONZALEZ v.

Accord-\ning to petitioner, \u201c[t]his official misinformation carried\nthe weight of a court decision and was enough to convince\na pro se litigant (and some lawyers) that the 90-day win-\ndow for filing a certiorari petition expired, as well.\u201d Ibid.\nThe State, however, represents that petitioner erroneously\nfiled the petition for rehearing under the case number of\nan earlier, dismissed appeal. Brief for Respondent 4. I do\nnot know how to resolve these allegations, but this only\nhighlights the propriety of a remand. Even on the State\u2019s\nversion of events, petitioner\u2019s attempt at filing for rehear-\ning is proof of diligence on his part.\n   Putting these allegations aside, the Court\u2019s reasoning is\ntoo parsimonious. While petitioner could have shown even\ngreater diligence by seeking rehearing for a second time\nand then filing for certiorari, we have never held pro se\nprisoners to the standards of counseled litigants. See, e.g.,\nHaines v. Kerner, 404 U. S. 519 (1972) (per curiam). In-\ndeed, petitioner\u2019s situation contrasts dramatically with\nthat of the movant in the case the Court relies on, Acker-\nmann v. United States, 340 U. S. 193 (1950). See ante, at\n13. In upholding the denial of Rule 60(b)(6) relief in\nAckermann, the Court put great emphasis on the fact that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n1999, and remanded the COA for a determination of which specific\nissues merited permission to appeal. On remand, petitioner filed a new\napplication for a COA, but this time the District Court denied the\nrequest. Petitioner then filed a timely appeal, and the District Court\ngranted his motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal. The Court\nof Appeals then declined to issue a COA and dismissed the appeal on\nApril 6, 2000.\n                     Cite as: 545 U.

See generally this Court\u2019s Rule 10. As for the fact that this\nCourt granted certiorari in Artuz eight days after the Eleventh Circuit\ndenied petitioner a COA, it would be unrealistic to fault petitioner for\nfailing to capitalize on this fortuity. In my experience, even lower\ncourts and counseled litigants are often not aware of our grants of\ncertiorari on issues that may be relevant to their current business. It\nwould be particularly inappropriate to impose such a strict expectation\non a pro se prisoner, particularly in the absence of any indication of\nwhen, given his circumstances in prison, he could have reasonably been\nexpected to learn of our grant in Artuz.\n",

The question presented is whether, in a habeas case, such motions are subject to the additional restrictions that apply to \"second or successive\" habeas corpus petitions under the provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), codified at 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244(b).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Aurelio Gonzalez pleaded guilty in Florida Circuit Court to one count of robbery with a firearm. He filed no appeal and began serving his 99-year sentence in 1982. Some 12 years later, petitioner began to seek relief from his conviction. He filed two motions for state postconviction relief, which the Florida courts denied. Thereafter, in June 1997, petitioner filed a federal habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*527</span> alleging that his guilty plea had not been entered knowingly and voluntarily.</p>\n<p>Upon the State's motion, the District Court dismissed petitioner's habeas petition as barred by AEDPA's statute of limitations, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244(d). Under Eleventh Circuit precedent, petitioner's filing deadline, absent tolling, was April 23, 1997, one year after AEDPA's statute of limitations took effect. <i>Wilcox</i> v. <i>Florida Dept. of Corrections,</i> 158 F. 3d 1209, 1211 (CA11 1998) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> Adopting a Magistrate Judge's recommendation, the District Court concluded that the limitations period was not tolled during the 163-day period while petitioner's second motion for state postconviction relief was pending. Section 2244(d)(2) tolls the statute of limitations during the pendency of \"properly filed\" applications only, and the District Court thought petitioner's motion was not \"properly filed\" because it was both untimely and successive. Without tolling, petitioner's federal habeas petition was two months late, so the District Court dismissed it as time barred. A judge of the Eleventh Circuit denied a certificate of appealability (COA) on April 6, 2000, and petitioner did not file for rehearing or review of that decision.</p>\n<p>On November 7, 2000, we held in <i>Artuz</i> v. <i>Bennett,</i> 531 U. S. 4, that an application for state postconviction relief can be \"properly filed\" even if the state courts dismiss it as procedurally barred. See <i>id.,</i> at 8-9. Almost nine months later, petitioner filed in the District Court a <i>pro se</i> \"Motion to Amend or Alter Judgment,\" contending that the District Court's time-bar ruling was incorrect under <i>Artuz</i>'s construction of \u00a7 2244(d), and invoking Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6), which permits a court to relieve a party from the effect of a final judgment.<sup>[1]</sup> The District Court denied the motion, and petitioner appealed.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*528</span> A judge of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit granted petitioner a COA, but a panel quashed the certificate as improvidently granted. 317 F. 3d 1308, 1310, 1314 (2003). The full court vacated that order and reheard the case en banc. It granted petitioner a COA but held, by a vote of 7 to 4, that the District Court was correct to deny his Rule 60(b) motion. The en banc majority determined that petitioner's motion\u0097indeed, any postjudgment motion under Rule 60(b) save one alleging fraud on the court under Rule 60(b)(3)\u0097was in substance a second or successive habeas corpus petition. 366 F. 3d 1253, 1278, 1281-1282 (2004). A state prisoner may not file such a petition without precertification by the court of appeals that the petition meets certain stringent criteria. \u00a7 2244(b). Because petitioner's motion did not satisfy these requirements, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed its denial. <i>Id.,</i> at 1282.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari. 543 U. S. 1086 (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Rule 60(b) allows a party to seek relief from a final judgment, and request reopening of his case, under a limited set of circumstances including fraud, mistake, and newly discovered evidence.<sup>[2]</sup> Rule 60(b)(6), the particular provision <span class=\"star-pagination\">*529</span> under which petitioner brought his motion, permits reopening when the movant shows \"any . . . reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment\" other than the more specific circumstances set out in Rules 60(b)(1)-(5). See <i>Liljeberg</i> v. <i>Health Services Acquisition Corp.,</i> 486 U. S. 847, 863, n. 11 (1988); <i>Klapprott</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 335 U. S. 601, 613 (1949) (opinion of Black, J.). The mere recitation of these provisions shows why we give little weight to respondent's appeal to the virtues of finality. That policy consideration, standing alone, is unpersuasive in the interpretation of a provision whose whole purpose is to make an exception to finality. The issue here is whether the text of Rule 60(b) itself, or of some other provision of law, limits its application in a manner relevant to the case before us.</p>\n<p>AEDPA did not expressly circumscribe the operation of Rule 60(b). (By contrast, AEDPA directly amended other provisions of the Federal Rules. See, <i>e. g.,</i> AEDPA, \u00a7 103, 110 Stat. 1218 (amending Fed. Rule App. Proc. 22).) The new habeas restrictions introduced by AEDPA are made indirectly relevant, however, by the fact that Rule 60(b), like the rest of the Rules of Civil Procedure, applies in habeas corpus proceedings under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254<sup>[3]</sup> only \"to the extent that [it is] not inconsistent with\" applicable federal statutory provisions and rules. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254 Rule 11; see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 81(a)(2). The relevant provisions of the AEDPA-amended habeas statutes, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(1)-(3), impose three requirements on second or successive habeas petitions: First, any claim that has already <span class=\"star-pagination\">*530</span> been adjudicated in a previous petition must be dismissed. \u00a7 2244(b)(1). Second, any claim that has <i>not</i> already been adjudicated must be dismissed unless it relies on either a new and retroactive rule of constitutional law or new facts showing a high probability of actual innocence. \u00a7 2244(b)(2). Third, before the district court may accept a successive petition for filing, the court of appeals must determine that it presents a claim not previously raised that is sufficient to meet \u00a7 2244(b)(2)'s new-rule or actual-innocence provisions. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). We proceed to consider whether these provisions limit the application of Rule 60(b) to the present case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>\"As a textual matter, \u00a7 2244(b) applies only where the court acts pursuant to a prisoner's `application'\" for a writ of habeas corpus. <i>Calderon</i> v. <i>Thompson,</i> 523 U. S. 538, 554 (1998). We therefore must decide whether a Rule 60(b) motion filed by a habeas petitioner is a \"habeas corpus application\" as the statute uses that term.</p>\n<p>Under \u00a7 2244(b), the first step of analysis is to determine whether a \"claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application\" was also \"presented in a prior application.\" If so, the claim must be dismissed; if not, the analysis proceeds to whether the claim satisfies one of two narrow exceptions. In either event, it is clear that for purposes of \u00a7 2244(b) an \"application\" for habeas relief is a filing that contains one or more \"claims.\" That definition is consistent with the use of the term \"application\" in the other habeas statutes in chapter 153 of title 28. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Woodford</i> v. <i>Garceau,</i> 538 U. S. 202, 207 (2003) (for purposes of \u00a7 2254(d), an application for habeas corpus relief is a filing that seeks \"an adjudication on the <i>merits</i> of the petitioner's claims\"). These statutes, and our own decisions, make clear that a \"claim\" as used in \u00a7 2244(b) is an asserted federal basis for relief from a state court's judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p>In some instances, a Rule 60(b) motion will contain one or more \"claims.\" For example, it might straightforwardly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*531</span> assert that owing to \"excusable neglect,\" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b)(1), the movant's habeas petition had omitted a claim of constitutional error, and seek leave to present that claim. Cf. <i>Harris</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 367 F. 3d 74, 80-81 (CA2 2004) (petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion sought relief from judgment because habeas counsel had failed to raise a Sixth Amendment claim). Similarly, a motion might seek leave to present \"newly discovered evidence,\" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b)(2), in support of a claim previously denied. <i>E. g., </i><i>Rodwell</i> v. <i>Pepe,</i> 324 F. 3d 66, 69 (CA1 2003). Or a motion might contend that a subsequent change in substantive law is a \"reason justifying relief,\" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b)(6), from the previous denial of a claim. <i>E. g., </i><i>Dunlap</i> v. <i>Litscher,</i> 301 F. 3d 873, 876 (CA7 2002). Virtually every Court of Appeals to consider the question has held that such a pleading, although labeled a Rule 60(b) motion, is in substance a successive habeas petition and should be treated accordingly. <i>E. g., </i><i>Rodwell, supra,</i> at 71-72; <i>Dunlap, supra,</i> at 876.</p>\n<p>We think those holdings are correct. A habeas petitioner's filing that seeks vindication of such a claim is, if not in substance a \"habeas corpus application,\" at least similar enough that failing to subject it to the same requirements would be \"inconsistent with\" the statute. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254 Rule 11. Using Rule 60(b) to present new claims for relief from a state court's judgment of conviction\u0097even claims couched in the language of a true Rule 60(b) motion\u0097circumvents AEDPA's requirement that a new claim be dismissed unless it relies on either a new rule of constitutional law or newly discovered facts. \u00a7 2244(b)(2). The same is true of a Rule 60(b)(2) motion presenting new evidence in support of a claim already litigated: Even assuming that reliance on a new factual predicate causes that motion to escape \u00a7 2244(b)(1)'s prohibition of claims \"presented in a prior application,\" \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B) requires a more convincing factual showing than does Rule 60(b). Likewise, a Rule 60(b) motion based on a purported change in the substantive law governing the claim could be used to circumvent \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(A)'s <span class=\"star-pagination\">*532</span> dictate that the only new law on which a successive petition may rely is \"a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\" In addition to the substantive conflict with AEDPA standards, in each of these three examples use of Rule 60(b) would impermissibly circumvent the requirement that a successive habeas petition be precertified by the court of appeals as falling within an exception to the successive-petition bar. \u00a7 2244(b)(3).</p>\n<p>In most cases, determining whether a Rule 60(b) motion advances one or more \"claims\" will be relatively simple. A motion that seeks to add a new ground for relief, as in <i>Harris, supra,</i> will of course qualify. A motion can also be said to bring a \"claim\" if it attacks the federal court's previous resolution of a claim <i>on the merits,</i><sup>[4]</sup> since alleging that the court erred in denying habeas relief on the merits is effectively indistinguishable from alleging that the movant is, under the substantive provisions of the statutes, entitled to habeas relief. That is not the case, however, when a Rule 60(b) motion attacks, not the substance of the federal court's resolution of a claim on the merits, but some defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*533</span> B</h2>\n<p>When no \"claim\" is presented, there is no basis for contending that the Rule 60(b) motion should be treated like a habeas corpus application. If neither the motion itself nor the federal judgment from which it seeks relief substantively addresses federal grounds for setting aside the movant's state conviction, allowing the motion to proceed as denominated creates no inconsistency with the habeas statute or rules. Petitioner's motion in the present case, which alleges that the federal courts misapplied the federal statute of limitations set out in \u00a7 2244(d), fits this description.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Like the Court of Appeals, respondent relies heavily on our decision in <i>Calderon</i> v. <i>Thompson,</i> 523 U. S. 538 (1998). In that case we reversed the Ninth Circuit's decision to recall its mandate and reconsider the denial of Thompson's first federal habeas petition; the recall was, we held, an abuse of discretion because of its inconsistency with the policies embodied in AEDPA. <i>Id.,</i> at 554-559. Analogizing an appellate court's recall of its mandate to a district court's grant of relief from judgment, the Eleventh Circuit thought that <i>Calderon</i>'s disposition applied to Rule 60(b). 366 F. 3d, at 1272-1277. We think otherwise. To begin with, as the opinion said, compliance with the actual text of AEDPA's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*534</span> successive-petition provision was not at issue in <i>Calderon</i>\u0097 because the Court of Appeals considered only the claims and evidence presented in Thompson's first federal habeas petition. 523 U. S., at 554. <i>Calderon</i> did state, however, that \"a prisoner's motion to recall the mandate <i>on the basis of the merits</i> of the underlying decision can be regarded as a second or successive application.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 553 (emphasis added). But that is entirely consonant with the proposition that a Rule 60(b) motion that seeks to revisit the federal court's denial <i>on the merits</i> of a claim for relief should be treated as a successive habeas petition. The problem for respondent is that this case does not present a revisitation <i>of the merits.</i> The motion here, like some other Rule 60(b) motions in \u00a7 2254 cases, confines itself not only to the first federal habeas petition, but to a nonmerits aspect of the first federal habeas proceeding. Nothing in <i>Calderon</i> suggests that entertaining such a filing is \"inconsistent with\" AEDPA.</p>\n<p>Rule 60(b) has an unquestionably valid role to play in habeas cases. The Rule is often used to relieve parties from the effect of a default judgment mistakenly entered against them, <i>e. g., </i><i>Klapprott,</i> 335 U. S., at 615 (opinion of Black, J.), a function as legitimate in habeas cases as in run-of-the-mine civil cases. The Rule also preserves parties' opportunity to obtain vacatur of a judgment that is void for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction\u0097a consideration just as valid in habeas cases as in any other, since absence of jurisdiction altogether deprives a federal court of the power to adjudicate the rights of the parties. <i>Steel Co.</i> v. <i>Citizens for Better Environment,</i> 523 U. S. 83, 94, 101 (1998). In some instances, we may note, it is the State, not the habeas petitioner, that seeks to use Rule 60(b), to reopen a habeas judgment <i>granting</i> the writ. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Ritter</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> 811 F. 2d 1398, 1400 (CA11 1987).</p>\n<p>Moreover, several characteristics of a Rule 60(b) motion limit the friction between the Rule and the successive-petition prohibitions of AEDPA, ensuring that our harmonization of the two will not expose federal courts to an avalanche <span class=\"star-pagination\">*535</span> of frivolous postjudgment motions. First, Rule 60(b) contains its own limitations, such as the requirement that the motion \"be made within a reasonable time\" and the more specific 1-year deadline for asserting three of the most open-ended grounds of relief (excusable neglect, newly discovered evidence, and fraud). Second, our cases have required a movant seeking relief under Rule 60(b)(6) to show \"extraordinary circumstances\" justifying the reopening of a final judgment. <i>Ackermann</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 340 U. S. 193, 199 (1950); accord, <i>id.,</i> at 202; <i>Liljeberg,</i> 486 U. S., at 864; <i>id.,</i> at 873 (REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting) (\"This very strict interpretation of Rule 60(b) is essential if the finality of judgments is to be preserved\"). Such circumstances will rarely occur in the habeas context. Third, Rule 60(b) proceedings are subject to only limited and deferential appellate review. <i>Browder</i> v. <i>Director, Dept. of Corrections of Ill.,</i> 434 U. S. 257, 263, n. 7 (1978). Many Courts of Appeals have construed 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2253 to impose an additional limitation on appellate review by requiring a habeas petitioner to obtain a COA as a prerequisite to appealing the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>Because petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion challenges only the District Court's previous ruling on the AEDPA statute of limitations, it is not the equivalent of a successive habeas <span class=\"star-pagination\">*536</span> petition. The Eleventh Circuit therefore erred in holding that petitioner did not qualify even to seek Rule 60(b) relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Although the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning is inconsistent with our holding today, we nonetheless affirm its denial of petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p>Petitioner's only ground for reopening the judgment denying his first federal habeas petition is that our decision in <i>Artuz</i> showed the error of the District Court's statute-of-limitations ruling. We assume for present purposes that the District Court's ruling was incorrect.<sup>[8]</sup> As we noted above, however, relief under Rule 60(b)(6)\u0097the only subsection petitioner invokes\u0097requires a showing of \"extraordinary circumstances.\" Petitioner contends that <i>Artuz</i>'s change in the interpretation of the AEDPA statute of limitations meets this description. We do not agree. The District Court's interpretation was by all appearances correct under the Eleventh Circuit's then-prevailing interpretation of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). It is hardly extraordinary that subsequently, after petitioner's case was no longer pending, this Court arrived at a different interpretation. Although our constructions of federal statutes customarily apply to all cases then pending on direct review, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Harper</i> v. <i>Virginia Dept. of Taxation,</i> 509 U. S. 86, 97 (1993), not every interpretation of the federal statutes setting forth the requirements for habeas provides cause for reopening cases long since final.<sup>[9]</sup> If <i>Artuz</i> justified reopening long-ago dismissals <span class=\"star-pagination\">*537</span> based on a lower court's unduly parsimonious interpretation of \u00a7 2244(d)(2), then <i>Pace</i> v. <i>DiGuglielmo,</i> 544 U. S. 408 (2005), would justify reopening long-ago grants of habeas relief based on a lower court's unduly <i>generous</i> interpretation of the same tolling provision.</p>\n<p>The change in the law worked by <i>Artuz</i> is all the less extraordinary in petitioner's case, because of his lack of diligence in pursuing review of the statute-of-limitations issue. At the time <i>Artuz</i> was decided, petitioner had abandoned any attempt to seek review of the District Court's decision on this statute-of-limitations issue. Although the District Court relied on Eleventh Circuit precedent holding that a state postconviction application is not \"properly filed\" if it is procedurally defaulted, and although that precedent was at odds with the rule in several other Circuits, petitioner neither raised that issue in his application for a COA, nor filed a petition for rehearing of the Eleventh Circuit's denial of a COA, nor sought certiorari review of that denial.<sup>[10]</sup> This lack of diligence confirms that <i>Artuz</i> is not an extraordinary circumstance justifying relief from the judgment in petitioner's case. Indeed, in one of the cases in which we explained Rule 60(b)(6)'s extraordinary-circumstances requirement, the movant had failed to appeal an adverse ruling by the District Court, whereas another party to the same judgment had <span class=\"star-pagination\">*538</span> appealed and won reversal. <i>Ackermann,</i> 340 U. S., at 195. Some years later, the petitioner sought Rule 60(b) relief, which the District Court denied. We affirmed the denial of Rule 60(b) relief, noting that the movant's decision not to appeal had been free and voluntary, although the favorable ruling in the companion case made it appear mistaken in hindsight. See <i>id.,</i> at 198.</p>\n<p>Under the Rule 60(b) standards that properly govern petitioner's motion, the District Court was correct to deny relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>We hold that a Rule 60(b)(6) motion in a \u00a7 2254 case is not to be treated as a successive habeas petition if it does not assert, or reassert, claims of error in the movant's state conviction. A motion that, like petitioner's, challenges only the District Court's failure to reach the merits does not warrant such treatment, and can therefore be ruled upon by the District Court without precertification by the Court of Appeals pursuant to \u00a7 2244(b)(3). In this case, however, petitioner's Rule 60(b)(6) motion fails to set forth an \"extraordinary circumstance\" justifying relief. For that reason, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER, concurring.</p>\n<p>The majority explains that a proper Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) motion \"attacks, not the substance of the federal court's resolution of a claim on the merits, but some defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 532. This is consistent with Judge Tjoflat's description of the standard in his opinion below, see 366 F. 3d 1253, 1297 (CA11 2004) (specially concurring in part and dissenting in part), and I agree with it. I fear that other language in the majority's opinion, especially its discussion of the significance of the word \"claim,\" could be taken to imply a different <span class=\"star-pagination\">*539</span> standard, with which I would disagree. With that qualification, I join the majority's opinion.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The most significant aspect of today's decision is the Court's unanimous rejection of the view that all postjudgment motions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) except those alleging fraud under Rule 60(b)(3) should be treated as second or successive habeas corpus petitions. Not only do I agree with that holding, I believe that we should have more promptly made clear that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) and Rule 60(b) can coexist in harmony. See <i>Abdur'Rahman</i> v. <i>Bell,</i> 537 U. S. 88, 90 (2002) (STEVENS, J., dissenting from dismissal of certiorari as improvidently granted).</p>\n<p>As the Court recognizes, whether a Rule 60(b) motion may proceed in the habeas context depends on the nature of the relief the motion seeks. See <i>ante,</i> at 533.<sup>[1]</sup> Given the substance of petitioner's motion, I agree with the Court that this was a \"true\" Rule 60(b) motion and that the District Court and the Court of Appeals therefore erred in treating it as a successive habeas petition. And while I also agree with much of the Court's reasoning in Parts I and II of its opinion, I believe the Court goes too far in commenting on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*540</span> issues that are not directly before us and that have not been fully briefed. See, <i>e. g., ante,</i> at 530-532 (discussing various Court of Appeals cases). My main disagreement, however, pertains to Part III of the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p>The Court reaches beyond the question on which we granted certiorari (whether petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion should be treated as a successive habeas petition) and adjudicates the merits of that motion. In my judgment, however, \"correct procedure requires that the merits of the Rule 60(b) motion be addressed in the first instance by the District Court.\" <i>Abdur'Rahman,</i> 537 U. S., at 97 (Stevens, J., dissenting). A district court considering a Rule 60(b) motion will often take into account a variety of factors in addition to the specific ground given for reopening the judgment. These factors include the diligence of the movant, the probable merit of the movant's underlying claims, the opposing party's reliance interests in the finality of the judgment, and other equitable considerations. See 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2857 (2d ed. 1995 and Supp. 2004); see <i>ibid.</i> (noting that appellate courts will reverse a district court's decision only for an abuse of discretion); <i>Plaut</i> v. <i>Spendthrift Farm, Inc.,</i> 514 U. S. 211, 233-234 (1995) (Rule 60(b) \"reflects and confirms the courts' own inherent and discretionary power, `firmly established in English practice long before the foundation of our Republic,' to set aside a judgment whose enforcement would work inequity\"). In light of the equitable, often fact-intensive nature of the Rule 60(b) inquiry, it is inappropriate for an appellate court to undertake it in the first instance. This is especially so in this case, in which both the briefing and the record before us are insufficient with regard to the merits issue.</p>\n<p>Orderly procedure aside, the Court's truncated analysis is unsatisfactory. At least in some circumstances, a supervening change in AEDPA procedural law can be the kind of \"extraordinary circumstanc[e],\" <i>Ackermann</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*541</span> 340 U. S. 193, 199 (1950), that constitutes a \"reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment\" within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(6). In this case, the District Court dismissed petitioner's habeas petition as time barred after concluding that his second motion for state postconviction relief did not toll AEDPA's statute of limitations. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244(d). After that judgment became final, however, we decided <i>Artuz</i> v. <i>Bennett,</i> 531 U. S. 4 (2000), which made clear that the District Court's ruling on tolling was erroneous and that the habeas petition should therefore not have been dismissed.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the Court underestimates the significance of the fact that petitioner was effectively shut out of federal court\u0097without any adjudication of the merits of his claims\u0097 because of a procedural ruling that was later shown to be flatly mistaken. As we have stressed, \"[d]ismissal of a <i>first</i> federal habeas petition is a particularly serious matter, for that dismissal denies the petitioner the protections of the Great Writ entirely, risking injury to an important interest in human liberty.\" <i>Lonchar</i> v. <i>Thomas,</i> 517 U. S. 314, 324 (1996); see also <i>Slack</i> v. <i>McDaniel,</i> 529 U. S. 473, 483 (2000) (\"The writ of habeas corpus plays a vital role in protecting constitutional rights\"). When a habeas petition has been dismissed on a clearly defective procedural ground, the State can hardly claim a legitimate interest in the finality of that judgment. Indeed, the State has experienced a windfall, while the state prisoner has been deprived\u0097contrary to congressional intent\u0097of his valuable right to one full round of federal habeas review.</p>\n<p>While this type of supervening change in procedural law may not alone warrant the reopening of a habeas judgment, there may be special factors that allow a prisoner to satisfy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*542</span> the high standard of Rule 60(b)(6). For instance, when a prisoner has shown reasonable diligence in seeking relief based on a change in procedural law, and when that prisoner can show that there is probable merit to his underlying claims, it would be well in keeping with a district court's discretion under Rule 60(b)(6) for that court to reopen the habeas judgment and give the prisoner the one fair shot at habeas review that Congress intended that he have. After all, we have consistently recognized that Rule 60(b)(6) \"provides courts with authority `adequate to enable them to vacate judgments whenever such action is appropriate to accomplish justice.'\" <i>Liljeberg</i> v. <i>Health Services Acquisition Corp.,</i> 486 U. S. 847, 864 (1988) (quoting <i>Klapprott</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 335 U. S. 601, 614-615 (1949)). Here, petitioner, who is serving a 99-year term in Florida prison, filed his Rule 60(b) motion approximately eight months after this Court's decision in <i>Artuz.</i> A district court could reasonably conclude that this period reveals no lack of diligence on the part of an incarcerated <i>pro se</i> litigant.<sup>[3]</sup> And while we have received scant briefing on the probable merit of his petition, his allegation\u0097that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because it was based on grossly inaccurate advice about the actual time he would serve in prison\u0097at least states a colorable claim of a constitutional violation. See <i>Finch</i> v. <i>Vaughn,</i> 67 F. 3d 909 (CA11 1995); see also <i>Mabry</i> v. <i>Johnson,</i> 467 U. S. 504 (1984).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court relies on petitioner's supposed lack of diligence in pursuing review of the District Court's initial statute-of-limitations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*543</span> ruling. See <i>ante,</i> at 537. In fact, petitioner did appeal the District Court's ruling, which the Court of Appeals correctly interpreted as a request for a certificate of appealability (COA).<sup>[5]</sup> As for petitioner's failure to seek rehearing or certiorari, he alleged in his Rule 60(b) motion, App. 16, and again in his reply brief, that he filed a timely petition for rehearing on April 18, 2000, but that the clerk of the Court of Appeals returned the motion unfiled, \"explaining, erroneously, that his appeal was dismissed and closed on October 28, 1999.\" Reply Brief for Petitioner 13 (emphasis deleted). According to petitioner, \"[t]his official misinformation carried the weight of a court decision and was enough to convince a <i>pro se</i> litigant (and some lawyers) that the 90-day window for filing a certiorari petition expired, as well.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The State, however, represents that petitioner erroneously filed the petition for rehearing under the case number of an earlier, dismissed appeal. Brief for Respondent 4. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*544</span> I do not know how to resolve these allegations, but this only highlights the propriety of a remand. Even on the State's version of events, petitioner's attempt at filing for rehearing is proof of diligence on his part.</p>\n<p>Putting these allegations aside, the Court's reasoning is too parsimonious. While petitioner could have shown even greater diligence by seeking rehearing for a second time and then filing for certiorari, we have never held <i>pro se</i> prisoners to the standards of counseled litigants. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Haines</i> v. <i>Kerner,</i> 404 U. S. 519 (1972) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> Indeed, petitioner's situation contrasts dramatically with that of the movant in the case the Court relies on, <i>Ackermann</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 340 U. S. 193 (1950). See <i>ante,</i> at 537-538. In upholding the denial of Rule 60(b)(6) relief in <i>Ackermann,</i> the Court put great emphasis on the fact that the movant had the benefit of paid counsel and that, for much of the relevant period, he was not detained, but rather enjoyed \"freedom of movement and action,\" 340 U. S., at 201.<sup>[6]</sup> In any event, I believe that our rules governing prisoner litigation should favor a policy of repose rather than a policy that encourages multiple filings with a low probability of success.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*545</span> Accordingly, I agree with the Court's conclusion that petitioner filed a \"true\" Rule 60(b) motion. I respectfully dissent, however, because of the Court's decision to rule on the merits of the motion in the first instance.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers by <i>Joshua L.

The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  In this case we consider only the extent to which Rule 60(b) applies to habeas proceedings under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254, which governs federal habeas relief for prisoners convicted in state court. Federal prisoners generally seek postconviction relief under \u00a7 2255, which contains its own provision governing second or successive applications. Although that portion of \u00a7 2255 is similar to, and refers to, the statutory subsection applicable to second or successive \u00a7 2254 petitions, it is not identical. Accordingly, we limit our consideration to \u00a7 2254 cases.</p>\n<p>[4]  The term \"on the merits\" has multiple usages. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Semtek Int'l Inc.</i> v. <i>Lockheed Martin Corp.,</i> 531 U. S. 497, 501-503 (2001). We refer here to a determination that there exist or do not exist grounds entitling a petitioner to habeas corpus relief under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2254(a) and (d). When a movant asserts one of those grounds (or asserts that a previous ruling regarding one of those grounds was in error) he is making a habeas corpus claim. He is not doing so when he merely asserts that a previous ruling which precluded a merits determination was in error\u0097for example, a denial for such reasons as failure to exhaust, procedural default, or statute-of-limitations bar.</p>\n<p>[5]  Fraud on the federal habeas court is one example of such a defect. See generally <i>Rodriguez</i> v. <i>Mitchell,</i> 252 F. 3d 191, 199 (CA2 2001) (a witness's allegedly fraudulent basis for refusing to appear at a federal habeas hearing \"relate[d] to the integrity of the federal habeas proceeding, not to the integrity of the state criminal trial\"). We note that an attack based on the movant's own conduct, or his habeas counsel's omissions, see, <i>e. g., supra,</i> at 530-531, ordinarily does not go to the integrity of the proceedings, but in effect asks for a second chance to have the merits determined favorably.</p>\n<p>[6]  Petitioner notes that we held in <i>Slack</i> v. <i>McDaniel,</i> 529 U. S. 473 (2000), that when a petition is dismissed without prejudice as unexhausted, the refiled petition is not \"successive.\" He argues that, by parity of reasoning, his Rule 60(b) motion challenging the District Court dismissal of his petition on statute-of-limitations grounds is not \"successive.\" If this argument is correct, petitioner would be able to file not just a Rule 60(b) motion, but a full-blown habeas petition, without running afoul of \u00a7 2244(b). But see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Murray</i> v. <i>Greiner,</i> 394 F. 3d 78, 81 (CA2 2005). We need not consider this contention, however, because we conclude that petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion is not subject to the limitations applicable to habeas petitions.</p>\n<p>[7]  See <i>Reid</i> v. <i>Angelone,</i> 369 F. 3d 363, 369, n. 2 (CA4 2004) (citing cases); 366 F. 3d 1253, 1263 (CA11 2004) (case below); cf. <i>Langford</i> v. <i>Day,</i> 134 F. 3d 1381, 1382 (CA9 1998) (before AEDPA, a certificate of probable cause was a prerequisite to appealing the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion in a habeas case); <i>Reid, supra,</i> at 368 (same). But see <i>Dunn</i> v. <i>Cockrell,</i> 302 F. 3d 491, 492 (CA5 2002); 366 F. 3d, at 1298-1300 (Tjoflat, J., specially concurring in part and dissenting in part). Although we do not decide in this case whether this construction of \u00a7 2253 is correct (the Eleventh Circuit granted petitioner a COA), the COA requirement appears to be a more plausible and effective screening requirement, with sounder basis in the statute, than the near-absolute bar imposed here by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>[8]  Although respondent contends that petitioner's motion for state postconviction relief was untimely, and that the District Court's denial of statutory tolling was therefore correct under <i>Pace</i> v. <i>DiGuglielmo,</i> 544 U. S. 408 (2005), the Florida courts made no reference to untimeliness in dismissing petitioner's motion.</p>\n<p>[9]  A change in the interpretation of a <i>substantive</i> statute may have consequences for cases that have already reached final judgment, particularly in the criminal context. See <i>Bousley</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 523 U. S. 614, 619-621 (1998); cf. <i>Fiore</i> v. <i>White,</i> 531 U. S. 225, 228-229 (2001) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>[10]  We granted review to resolve the conflict over the interpretation of \"properly filed\" on April 17, 2000, only eight days after the Eleventh Circuit denied petitioner a COA and well within the 90-day period in which petitioner could have sought certiorari. <i>Artuz</i> v. <i>Bennett,</i> 529 U. S. 1065. Whether or not petitioner was aware that the issue was pending before us, see <i>post,</i> at 544-545, n. 7 (STEVENS, J., dissenting), it is indisputable that had he but filed a petition raising the statute-of-limitations argument he now advances, we would surely have granted him the reconsideration in light of <i>Artuz</i> v. <i>Bennett,</i> 531 U. S. 4 (2000), that he later sought in his Rule 60(b) motion. See, <i>e. g., Brown</i> v. <i>Moore,</i> 532 U. S. 968 (2001) (granting a <i>pro se</i> petition for certiorari, vacating the Eleventh Circuit's judgment denying a COA, and remanding for reconsideration in light of <i>Artuz,</i> 531 U. S. 4).</p>\n<p>[1]  Under the First Circuit's useful formulation, which was invoked by Judge Tjoflat's dissenting opinion below, \"[w]hen the motion's factual predicate deals primarily with the constitutionality of the underlying state conviction or sentence, then the motion should be treated as a second or successive habeas petition. This situation should be distinguished from one in which the motion's factual predicate deals primarily with some irregularity or procedural defect in the procurement of the judgment denying relief. That is the classic function of a Rule 60(b) motion, and such a motion should be treated within the usual confines of Rule 60(b).\" <i>Rodwell</i> v. <i>Pepe,</i> 324 F. 3d 66, 70 (2003) (citation omitted); see also 366 F. 3d 1253, 1297 (CA11 2004) (Tjoflat, J., specially concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>[2]  Although the State contests this point in a footnote, see Brief for Respondent 40-41, n. 33, the Court rightly assumes that the District Court's decision was incorrect. See <i>ante,</i> at 536, and n. 8. If any doubt remains, it should be resolved by the District Court in the first instance.</p>\n<p>[3]  While Rule 60(b)(6) contains no specific time limitation on filing, it is worth noting that petitioner filed his motion within the strict 1-year limitation that applies to motions under Rules 60(b)(1)-(3).</p>\n<p>[4]  It is also worth noting that <i>Artuz</i> v. <i>Bennett,</i> 531 U. S. 4 (2000), was decided only seven months after petitioner's habeas judgment became final. In cases where significant time has elapsed between a habeas judgment and the relevant change in procedural law, it would be within a district court's discretion to leave such a judgment in repose.</p>\n<p>[5]  See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 22(b)(2) (\"If no express request for a certificate is filed, the notice of [appeal shall be deemed to constitute] a request addressed to the judges of the court of appeals\"). The procedural route that petitioner navigated was actually more complicated. After the Magistrate Judge initially recommended dismissal of the petition as time barred, petitioner filed an objection that raised a Third Circuit case, <i>Lovasz</i> v. <i>Vaughn,</i> 134 F. 3d 146 (1998), which was among the circuit cases that were later endorsed by <i>Artuz,</i> 531 U. S., at 8. The Magistrate's final report noted that the Eleventh Circuit had not addressed the relevant issue of tolling, and then proceeded to rely (oddly) on <i>Lovasz</i> to deny petitioner's claim. In my view, the citation to <i>Lovasz</i> and the Magistrate's acknowledgment that there was no Eleventh Circuit precedent on point provided a reasonable basis for the granting of a COA.\n</p>\n<p>In fact, on September 23, 1998, petitioner filed an application for a COA, and this application was granted by the District Court. The Court of Appeals, however, dismissed petitioner's appeal on October 28, 1999, and remanded the COA for a determination of which specific issues merited permission to appeal. On remand, petitioner filed a new application for a COA, but this time the District Court denied the request. Petitioner then filed a timely appeal, and the District Court granted his motion to proceed <i>in forma pauperis</i> on appeal. The Court of Appeals then declined to issue a COA and dismissed the appeal on April 6, 2000.</p>\n<p>[6]  <i>Ackermann</i> is further distinguishable in that it did not involve the sort of plain error of law that has been identified in this case. But even if <i>Ackermann</i> were not distinguishable, I would find the views expressed by Justices Black, Frankfurter, and Douglas in dissent, see 340 U. S., at 202 (opinion of Black, J.), more persuasive than those expressed by Justice Minton.</p>\n<p>[7]  A petition for certiorari seeking review of a denial of a COA has an objectively low chance of being granted. Such a decision is not thought to present a good vehicle for resolving legal issues, and error correction is a disfavored basis for granting review, particularly in noncapital cases. See generally this Court's Rule 10. As for the fact that this Court granted certiorari in <i>Artuz</i> eight days after the Eleventh Circuit denied petitioner a COA, it would be unrealistic to fault petitioner for failing to capitalize on this fortuity. In my experience, even lower courts and counseled litigants are often not aware of our grants of certiorari on issues that may be relevant to their current business. It would be particularly inappropriate to impose such a strict expectation on a <i>pro se</i> prisoner, particularly in the absence of any indication of when, given his circumstances in prison, he could have reasonably been expected to learn of our grant in <i>Artuz.</i></p>\n\n</div>",
