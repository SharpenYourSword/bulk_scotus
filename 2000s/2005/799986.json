Our decision turns on the correct interpretation of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1367. The question has divided the Courts of Appeals, and we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 543 U. S. 924 (2004).</p>\n<p>We hold that, where the other elements of jurisdiction are present and at least one named plaintiff in the action satisfies the amount-in-controversy requirement, \u00a7 1367 does authorize supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of other plaintiffs in the same Article III case or controversy, even if those claims are for less than the jurisdictional amount specified in the statute setting forth the requirements for diversity jurisdiction. We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in No. 04-70, and we reverse <span class=\"star-pagination\">*550</span> the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in No. 04-79.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In 1991, about 10,000 Exxon dealers filed a class-action suit against the Exxon Corporation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida. The dealers alleged an intentional and systematic scheme by Exxon under which they were overcharged for fuel purchased from Exxon. The plaintiffs invoked the District Court's \u00a7 1332(a) diversity jurisdiction. After a unanimous jury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, the District Court certified the case for interlocutory review, asking whether it had properly exercised \u00a7 1367 supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of class members who did not meet the jurisdictional minimum amount in controversy.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld the District Court's extension of supplemental jurisdiction to these class members. <i>Allapattah Services, Inc.</i> v. <i>Exxon Corp.,</i> 333 F. 3d 1248 (2003). \"[W]e find,\" the court held, \"that \u00a7 1367 clearly and unambiguously provides district courts with the authority in diversity class actions to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of class members who do not meet the minimum amount in controversy as long as the district court has original jurisdiction over the claims of at least one of the class representatives.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1256. This decision accords with the views of the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits. See <i>Rosmer</i> v. <i>Pfizer, Inc.,</i> 263 F. 3d 110 (CA4 2001); <i>Olden</i> v. <i>LaFarge Corp.,</i> 383 F. 3d 495 (CA6 2004); <i>Stromberg Metal Works, Inc.</i> v. <i>Press Mechanical, Inc.,</i> 77 F. 3d 928 (CA7 1996); <i>In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litigation,</i> 123 F. 3d 599 (CA7 1997). The Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Ninth Circuits, adopting a similar analysis of the statute, have held that in a diversity class action the unnamed class members need not meet the amount-in-controversy requirement, provided the named class members <span class=\"star-pagination\">*551</span> do. These decisions, however, are unclear on whether all the named plaintiffs must satisfy this requirement. <i>In re Abbott Labs.,</i> 51 F. 3d 524 (CA5 1995); <i>Gibson</i> v. <i>Chrysler Corp.,</i> 261 F. 3d 927 (CA9 2001).</p>\n<p>In the other case now before us the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit took a different position on the meaning of \u00a7 1367(a). 370 F. 3d 124 (2004). In that case, a 9-year-old girl sued Star-Kist in a diversity action in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, seeking damages for unusually severe injuries she received when she sliced her finger on a tuna can. Her family joined in the suit, seeking damages for emotional distress and certain medical expenses. The District Court granted summary judgment to Star-Kist, finding that none of the plaintiffs met the minimum amount-in-controversy requirement. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, however, ruled that the injured girl, but not her family members, had made allegations of damages in the requisite amount.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals then addressed whether, in light of the fact that one plaintiff met the requirements for original jurisdiction, supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining plaintiffs' claims was proper under \u00a7 1367. The court held that \u00a7 1367 authorizes supplemental jurisdiction only when the district court has original jurisdiction over the action, and that in a diversity case original jurisdiction is lacking if one plaintiff fails to satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement. Although the Court of Appeals claimed to \"express no view\" on whether the result would be the same in a class action, <i>id.,</i> at 143, n. 19, its analysis is inconsistent with that of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit's view of \u00a7 1367 is, however, shared by the Courts of Appeals for the Third, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits, and the latter two Courts of Appeals have expressly applied this rule to class actions. See <i>Meritcare, Inc.</i> v. <i>St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co.,</i> 166 F. 3d 214 (CA3 1999); <i>Trimble</i> v. <i>Asarco, Inc.,</i> 232 F. 3d 946 (CA8 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*552</span> 2000); <i>Leonhardt</i> v. <i>Western Sugar Co.,</i> 160 F. 3d 631 (CA10 1998).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The district courts of the United States, as we have said many times, are \"courts of limited jurisdiction. They possess only that power authorized by Constitution and statute,\" <i>Kokkonen</i> v. <i>Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America,</i> 511 U. S. 375, 377 (1994). In order to provide a federal forum for plaintiffs who seek to vindicate federal rights, Congress has conferred on the district courts original jurisdiction in federal-question cases\u0097civil actions that arise under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1331. In order to provide a neutral forum for what have come to be known as diversity cases, Congress also has granted district courts original jurisdiction in civil actions between citizens of different States, between U. S. citizens and foreign citizens, or by foreign states against U. S. citizens. \u00a7 1332. To ensure that diversity jurisdiction does not flood the federal courts with minor disputes, \u00a7 1332(a) requires that the matter in controversy in a diversity case exceed a specified amount, currently $75,000.</p>\n<p>Although the district courts may not exercise jurisdiction absent a statutory basis, it is well established\u0097in certain classes of cases\u0097that, once a court has original jurisdiction over some claims in the action, it may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims that are part of the same case or controversy. The leading modern case for this principle is <i>Mine Workers</i> v. <i>Gibbs,</i> 383 U. S. 715 (1966). In <i>Gibbs,</i> the plaintiff alleged the defendant's conduct violated both federal and state law. The District Court, <i>Gibbs</i> held, had original jurisdiction over the action based on the federal claims. <i>Gibbs</i> confirmed that the District Court had the additional power (though not the obligation) to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over related state claims that arose from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*553</span> the same Article III case or controversy. <i>Id.,</i> at 725 (\"The federal claim must have substance sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the court. . . . [A]ssuming substantiality of the federal issues, there is <i>power</i> in federal courts to hear the whole\").</p>\n<p>As we later noted, the decision allowing jurisdiction over pendent state claims in <i>Gibbs</i> did not mention, let alone come to grips with, the text of the jurisdictional statutes and the bedrock principle that federal courts have no jurisdiction without statutory authorization. <i>Finley</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 490 U. S. 545, 548 (1989). In <i>Finley,</i> we nonetheless reaffirmed and rationalized <i>Gibbs</i> and its progeny by inferring from it the interpretive principle that, in cases involving supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims between parties properly in federal court, the jurisdictional statutes should be read broadly, on the assumption that in this context Congress intended to authorize courts to exercise their full Article III power to dispose of an \"`entire action before the court [which] comprises but one constitutional \"case.\"'\" 490 U. S., at 549 (quoting <i>Gibbs, supra,</i> at 725).</p>\n<p>We have not, however, applied <i>Gibbs'</i> expansive interpretive approach to other aspects of the jurisdictional statutes. For instance, we have consistently interpreted \u00a7 1332 as requiring complete diversity: In a case with multiple plaintiffs and multiple defendants, the presence in the action of a single plaintiff from the same State as a single defendant deprives the district court of original diversity jurisdiction over the entire action. <i>Strawbridge</i> v. <i>Curtiss,</i> 3 Cranch 267 (1806); <i>Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co.</i> v. <i>Kroger,</i> 437 U. S. 365, 375 (1978). The complete diversity requirement is not mandated by the Constitution, <i>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co.</i> v. <i>Tashire,</i> 386 U. S. 523, 530-531 (1967), or by the plain text of \u00a7 1332(a). The Court, nonetheless, has adhered to the complete diversity rule in light of the purpose of the diversity requirement, which is to provide a federal forum for important disputes where state courts might favor, or be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*554</span> perceived as favoring, home-state litigants. The presence of parties from the same State on both sides of a case dispels this concern, eliminating a principal reason for conferring \u00a7 1332 jurisdiction over any of the claims in the action. See <i>Wisconsin Dept. of Corrections</i> v. <i>Schacht,</i> 524 U. S. 381, 389 (1998); <i>Newman-Green, Inc.</i> v. <i>Alfonzo-Larrain,</i> 490 U. S. 826, 829 (1989). The specific purpose of the complete diversity rule explains both why we have not adopted <i>Gibbs'</i> expansive interpretive approach to this aspect of the jurisdictional statute and why <i>Gibbs</i> does not undermine the complete diversity rule. In order for a federal court to invoke supplemental jurisdiction under <i>Gibbs,</i> it must first have original jurisdiction over at least one claim in the action. Incomplete diversity destroys original jurisdiction with respect to all claims, so there is nothing to which supplemental jurisdiction can adhere.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the diversity requirement, most of the other statutory prerequisites for federal jurisdiction, including the federal-question and amount-in-controversy requirements, can be analyzed claim by claim. True, it does not follow by necessity from this that a district court has authority to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over all claims provided there is original jurisdiction over just one. Before the enactment of \u00a7 1367, the Court declined in contexts other than the pendent-claim instance to follow <i>Gibbs'</i> expansive approach to interpretation of the jurisdictional statutes. The Court took a more restrictive view of the proper interpretation of these statutes in so-called pendent-party cases involving supplemental jurisdiction over claims involving additional parties\u0097plaintiffs or defendants\u0097where the district courts would lack original jurisdiction over claims by each of the parties standing alone.</p>\n<p>Thus, with respect to plaintiff-specific jurisdictional requirements, the Court held in <i>Clark</i> v. <i>Paul Gray, Inc.,</i> 306 U. S. 583 (1939), that every plaintiff must separately satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement. Though <i>Clark</i> was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*555</span> a federal-question case, at that time federal-question jurisdiction had an amount-in-controversy requirement analogous to the amount-in-controversy requirement for diversity cases. \"Proper practice,\" <i>Clark</i> held, \"requires that where each of several plaintiffs is bound to establish the jurisdictional amount with respect to his own claim, the suit should be dismissed as to those who fail to show that the requisite amount is involved.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 590. The Court reaffirmed this rule, in the context of a class action brought invoking \u00a7 1332(a) diversity jurisdiction, in <i>Zahn</i> v. <i>International Paper Co.,</i> 414 U. S. 291 (1973). It follows \"inescapably\" from <i>Clark,</i> the Court held in <i>Zahn,</i> that \"any plaintiff without the jurisdictional amount must be dismissed from the case, even though others allege jurisdictionally sufficient claims.\" 414 U. S., at 300.</p>\n<p>The Court took a similar approach with respect to supplemental jurisdiction over claims against additional defendants that fall outside the district courts' original jurisdiction. In <i>Aldinger</i> v. <i>Howard,</i> 427 U. S. 1 (1976), the plaintiff brought a Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983, action against county officials in District Court pursuant to the statutory grant of jurisdiction in 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1343(3) (1976 ed.). The plaintiff further alleged the court had supplemental jurisdiction over her related state-law claims against the county, even though the county was not suable under \u00a7 1983 and so was not subject to \u00a7 1343(3)'s original jurisdiction. The Court held that supplemental jurisdiction could not be exercised because Congress, in enacting \u00a7 1343(3), had declined (albeit implicitly) to extend federal jurisdiction over any party who could not be sued under the federal civil rights statutes. 427 U. S., at 16-19. \"Before it can be concluded that [supplemental] jurisdiction [over additional parties] exists,\" <i>Aldinger</i> held, \"a federal court must satisfy itself not only that Art[icle] III permits it, but that Congress in the statutes conferring jurisdiction has not expressly or by implication negated its existence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 18.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*556</span> In <i>Finley</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 490 U. S. 545 (1989), we confronted a similar issue in a different statutory context. The plaintiff in <i>Finley</i> brought a Federal Tort Claims Act negligence suit against the Federal Aviation Administration in District Court, which had original jurisdiction under \u00a7 1346(b). The plaintiff tried to add related claims against other defendants, invoking the District Court's supplemental jurisdiction over so-called pendent parties. We held that the District Court lacked a sufficient statutory basis for exercising supplemental jurisdiction over these claims. Relying primarily on <i>Zahn, Aldinger,</i> and <i>Kroger,</i> we held in <i>Finley</i> that \"a grant of jurisdiction over claims involving particular parties does not itself confer jurisdiction over additional claims by or against different parties.\" 490 U. S., at 556. While <i>Finley</i> did not \"limit or impair\" <i>Gibbs'</i> liberal approach to interpreting the jurisdictional statutes in the context of supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims involving the same parties, 490 U. S., at 556, <i>Finley</i> nevertheless declined to extend that interpretive assumption to claims involving additional parties. <i>Finley</i> held that in the context of parties, in contrast to claims, \"we will not assume that the full constitutional power has been congressionally authorized, and will not read jurisdictional statutes broadly.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 549.</p>\n<p>As the jurisdictional statutes existed in 1989, then, here is how matters stood: First, the diversity requirement in \u00a7 1332(a) required complete diversity; absent complete diversity, the district court lacked original jurisdiction over all of the claims in the action. <i>Strawbridge,</i> 3 Cranch, at 267-268; <i>Kroger,</i> 437 U. S., at 373-374. Second, if the district court had original jurisdiction over at least one claim, the jurisdictional statutes implicitly authorized supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims between the same parties arising out of the same Article III case or controversy. <i>Gibbs,</i> 383 U. S., at 725. Third, even when the district court had original <span class=\"star-pagination\">*557</span> jurisdiction over one or more claims between particular parties, the jurisdictional statutes did not authorize supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims involving other parties. <i>Clark,</i> 306 U. S., at 590; <i>Zahn, supra,</i> at 300-301; <i>Finley, supra,</i> at 556.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In <i>Finley</i> we emphasized that \"[w]hatever we say regarding the scope of jurisdiction conferred by a particular statute can of course be changed by Congress.\" 490 U. S., at 556. In 1990, Congress accepted the invitation. It passed the Judicial Improvements Act, 104 Stat. 5089, which enacted \u00a7 1367, the provision which controls these cases.</p>\n<p>Section 1367 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution. Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) In any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332 of this title, the district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19 of such rules, or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 24 of such rules, when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section 1332.\"</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*558</span> All parties to this litigation and all courts to consider the question agree that \u00a7 1367 overturned the result in <i>Finley.</i> There is no warrant, however, for assuming that \u00a7 1367 did no more than to overrule <i>Finley</i> and otherwise to codify the existing state of the law of supplemental jurisdiction. We must not give jurisdictional statutes a more expansive interpretation than their text warrants, 490 U. S., at 549, 556; but it is just as important not to adopt an artificial construction that is narrower than what the text provides. No sound canon of interpretation requires Congress to speak with extraordinary clarity in order to modify the rules of federal jurisdiction within appropriate constitutional bounds. Ordinary principles of statutory construction apply. In order to determine the scope of supplemental jurisdiction authorized by \u00a7 1367, then, we must examine the statute's text in light of context, structure, and related statutory provisions.</p>\n<p>Section 1367(a) is a broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction over other claims within the same case or controversy, as long as the action is one in which the district courts would have original jurisdiction. The last sentence of \u00a7 1367(a) makes it clear that the grant of supplemental jurisdiction extends to claims involving joinder or intervention of additional parties. The single question before us, therefore, is whether a diversity case in which the claims of some plaintiffs satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement, but the claims of other plaintiffs do not, presents a \"civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction.\" If the answer is yes, \u00a7 1367(a) confers supplemental jurisdiction over all claims, including those that do not independently satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement, if the claims are part of the same Article III case or controversy. If the answer is no, \u00a7 1367(a) is inapplicable and, in light of our holdings in <i>Clark</i> and <i>Zahn,</i> the district court has no statutory basis for exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the additional claims.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*559</span> We now conclude the answer must be yes. When the well-pleaded complaint contains at least one claim that satisfies the amount-in-controversy requirement, and there are no other relevant jurisdictional defects, the district court, beyond all question, has original jurisdiction over that claim. The presence of other claims in the complaint, over which the district court may lack original jurisdiction, is of no moment. If the court has original jurisdiction over a single claim in the complaint, it has original jurisdiction over a \"civil action\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1367(a), even if the civil action over which it has jurisdiction comprises fewer claims than were included in the complaint. Once the court determines it has original jurisdiction over the civil action, it can turn to the question whether it has a constitutional and statutory basis for exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the other claims in the action.</p>\n<p>Section 1367(a) commences with the direction that \u00a7\u00a7 1367(b) and (c), or other relevant statutes, may provide specific exceptions, but otherwise \u00a7 1367(a) is a broad jurisdictional grant, with no distinction drawn between pendent-claim and pendent-party cases. In fact, the last sentence of \u00a7 1367(a) makes clear that the provision grants supplemental jurisdiction over claims involving joinder or intervention of additional parties. The terms of \u00a7 1367 do not acknowledge any distinction between pendent jurisdiction and the doctrine of so-called ancillary jurisdiction. Though the doctrines of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction developed separately as a historical matter, the Court has recognized that the doctrines are \"two species of the same generic problem,\" <i>Kroger,</i> 437 U. S., at 370. Nothing in \u00a7 1367 indicates a congressional intent to recognize, preserve, or create some meaningful, substantive distinction between the jurisdictional categories we have historically labeled pendent and ancillary.</p>\n<p>If \u00a7 1367(a) were the sum total of the relevant statutory language, our holding would rest on that language alone. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*560</span> The statute, of course, instructs us to examine \u00a7 1367(b) to determine if any of its exceptions apply, so we proceed to that section. While \u00a7 1367(b) qualifies the broad rule of \u00a7 1367(a), it does not withdraw supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of the additional parties at issue here. The specific exceptions to \u00a7 1367(a) contained in \u00a7 1367(b), moreover, provide additional support for our conclusion that \u00a7 1367(a) confers supplemental jurisdiction over these claims. Section 1367(b), which applies only to diversity cases, withholds supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of plaintiffs proposed to be joined as indispensable parties under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19, or who seek to intervene pursuant to Rule 24. Nothing in the text of \u00a7 1367(b), however, withholds supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of plaintiffs permissively joined under Rule 20 (like the additional plaintiffs in No. 04-79) or certified as class-action members pursuant to Rule 23 (like the additional plaintiffs in No. 04-70). The natural, indeed the necessary, inference is that \u00a7 1367 confers supplemental jurisdiction over claims by Rule 20 and Rule 23 plaintiffs. This inference, at least with respect to Rule 20 plaintiffs, is strengthened by the fact that \u00a7 1367(b) explicitly excludes supplemental jurisdiction over claims against defendants joined under Rule 20.</p>\n<p>We cannot accept the view, urged by some of the parties, commentators, and Courts of Appeals, that a district court lacks original jurisdiction over a civil action unless the court has original jurisdiction over every claim in the complaint. As we understand this position, it requires assuming either that all claims in the complaint must stand or fall as a single, indivisible \"civil action\" as a matter of definitional necessity \u0097what we will refer to as the \"indivisibility theory\"\u0097or else that the inclusion of a claim or party falling outside the district court's original jurisdiction somehow contaminates every other claim in the complaint, depriving the court of original jurisdiction over any of these claims\u0097what we will refer to as the \"contamination theory.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*561</span> The indivisibility theory is easily dismissed, as it is inconsistent with the whole notion of supplemental jurisdiction. If a district court must have original jurisdiction over every claim in the complaint in order to have \"original jurisdiction\" over a \"civil action,\" then in <i>Gibbs</i> there was no civil action of which the district court could assume original jurisdiction under \u00a7 1331, and so no basis for exercising supplemental jurisdiction over any of the claims. The indivisibility theory is further belied by our practice\u0097in both federal-question and diversity cases\u0097of allowing federal courts to cure jurisdictional defects by dismissing the offending parties rather than dismissing the entire action. <i>Clark,</i> for example, makes clear that claims that are jurisdictionally defective as to amount in controversy do not destroy original jurisdiction over other claims. 306 U. S., at 590 (dismissing parties who failed to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement but retaining jurisdiction over the remaining party). If the presence of jurisdictionally problematic claims in the complaint meant the district court was without original jurisdiction over the single, indivisible civil action before it, then the district court would have to dismiss the whole action rather than particular parties.</p>\n<p>We also find it unconvincing to say that the definitional indivisibility theory applies in the context of diversity cases but not in the context of federal-question cases. The broad and general language of the statute does not permit this result. The contention is premised on the notion that the phrase \"original jurisdiction of all civil actions\" means different things in \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1332. It is implausible, however, to say that the identical phrase means one thing (original jurisdiction in all actions where at least one claim in the complaint meets the following requirements) in \u00a7 1331 and something else (original jurisdiction in all actions where every claim in the complaint meets the following requirements) in \u00a7 1332.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*562</span> The contamination theory, as we have noted, can make some sense in the special context of the complete diversity requirement because the presence of nondiverse parties on both sides of a lawsuit eliminates the justification for providing a federal forum. The theory, however, makes little sense with respect to the amount-in-controversy requirement, which is meant to ensure that a dispute is sufficiently important to warrant federal-court attention. The presence of a single nondiverse party may eliminate the fear of bias with respect to all claims, but the presence of a claim that falls short of the minimum amount in controversy does nothing to reduce the importance of the claims that do meet this requirement.</p>\n<p>It is fallacious to suppose, simply from the proposition that \u00a7 1332 imposes both the diversity requirement and the amount-in-controversy requirement, that the contamination theory germane to the former is also relevant to the latter. There is no inherent logical connection between the amount-in-controversy requirement and \u00a7 1332 diversity jurisdiction. After all, federal-question jurisdiction once had an amount-in-controversy requirement as well. If such a requirement were revived under \u00a7 1331, it is clear beyond peradventure that \u00a7 1367(a) provides supplemental jurisdiction over federal-question cases where some, but not all, of the federal-law claims involve a sufficient amount in controversy. In other words, \u00a7 1367(a) unambiguously overrules the holding and the result in <i>Clark.</i> If that is so, however, it would be quite extraordinary to say that \u00a7 1367 did not also overrule <i>Zahn,</i> a case that was premised in substantial part on the holding in <i>Clark.</i></p>\n<p>In addition to the theoretical difficulties with the argument that a district court has original jurisdiction over a civil action only if it has original jurisdiction over each individual claim in the complaint, we have already considered and rejected a virtually identical argument in the closely analogous context of removal jurisdiction. In <i>Chicago</i> v. <i>International</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*563</span> <i>College of Surgeons,</i> 522 U. S. 156 (1997), the plaintiff brought federal- and state-law claims in state court. The defendant removed to federal court. The plaintiff objected to removal, citing the text of the removal statute, \u00a7 1441(a). That statutory provision, which bears a striking similarity to the relevant portion of \u00a7 1367, authorizes removal of \"any civil action . . . of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction . . . .\" The <i>College of Surgeons</i> plaintiff urged that, because its state-law claims were not within the District Court's original jurisdiction, \u00a7 1441(a) did not authorize removal. We disagreed. The federal-law claims, we held, \"suffice to make the actions `civil actions' within the `original jurisdiction' of the district courts . . . . Nothing in the jurisdictional statutes suggests that the presence of related state law claims somehow alters the fact that [the plaintiff's] complaints, by virtue of their federal claims, were `civil actions' within the federal courts' `original jurisdiction.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 166. Once the case was removed, the District Court had original jurisdiction over the federal-law claims and supplemental jurisdiction under \u00a7 1367(a) over the state-law claims. <i>Id.,</i> at 165.</p>\n<p>The dissent in <i>College of Surgeons</i> argued that because the plaintiff sought on-the-record review of a local administrative agency decision, the review it sought was outside the scope of the District Court's jurisdiction. <i>Id.,</i> at 177 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.). We rejected both the suggestion that state-law claims involving administrative appeals are beyond the scope of \u00a7 1367 supplemental jurisdiction, <i>id.,</i> at 168-172 (opinion of the Court), and the claim that the administrative review posture of the case deprived the District Court of original jurisdiction over the federal-law claims in the case, <i>id.,</i> at 163-168. More importantly for present purposes, <i>College of Surgeons</i> stressed that a district court has original jurisdiction of a civil action for purposes of \u00a7 1441(a) as long as it has original jurisdiction over a subset of the claims constituting the action. Even the <i>College of Surgeons</i> dissent, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*564</span> which took issue with the Court's interpretation of \u00a7 1367, did not appear to contest this view of \u00a7 1441(a).</p>\n<p>Although <i>College of Surgeons</i> involved additional claims between the same parties, its interpretation of \u00a7 1441(a) applies equally to cases involving additional parties whose claims fall short of the jurisdictional amount. If we were to adopt the contrary view that the presence of additional parties means there is no \"civil action . . . of which the district courts . . . have original jurisdiction,\" those cases simply would not be removable. To our knowledge, no court has issued a reasoned opinion adopting this view of the removal statute. It is settled, of course, that absent complete diversity a case is not removable because the district court would lack original jurisdiction. <i>Caterpillar Inc.</i> v. <i>Lewis,</i> 519 U. S. 61, 73 (1996). This, however, is altogether consistent with our view of \u00a7 1441(a). A failure of complete diversity, unlike the failure of some claims to meet the requisite amount in controversy, contaminates every claim in the action.</p>\n<p>We also reject the argument, similar to the attempted distinction of <i>College of Surgeons</i> discussed above, that while the presence of additional claims over which the district court lacks jurisdiction does not mean the civil action is outside the purview of \u00a7 1367(a), the presence of additional parties does. The basis for this distinction is not altogether clear, and it is in considerable tension with statutory text. Section 1367(a) applies by its terms to any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, and the last sentence of \u00a7 1367(a) expressly contemplates that the court may have supplemental jurisdiction over additional parties. So it cannot be the case that the presence of those parties destroys the court's original jurisdiction, within the meaning of \u00a7 1367(a), over a civil action otherwise properly before it. Also, \u00a7 1367(b) expressly withholds supplemental jurisdiction in diversity cases over claims by plaintiffs joined as indispensable parties under Rule 19. If joinder of such <span class=\"star-pagination\">*565</span> parties were sufficient to deprive the district court of original jurisdiction over the civil action within the meaning of \u00a7 1367(a), this specific limitation on supplemental jurisdiction in \u00a7 1367(b) would be superfluous. The argument that the presence of additional parties removes the civil action from the scope of \u00a7 1367(a) also would mean that \u00a7 1367 left the <i>Finley</i> result undisturbed. <i>Finley,</i> after all, involved a Federal Tort Claims Act suit against a federal defendant and state-law claims against additional defendants not otherwise subject to federal jurisdiction. Yet all concede that one purpose of \u00a7 1367 was to change the result reached in <i>Finley.</i></p>\n<p>Finally, it is suggested that our interpretation of \u00a7 1367(a) creates an anomaly regarding the exceptions listed in \u00a7 1367(b): It is not immediately obvious why Congress would withhold supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs joined as parties \"needed for just adjudication\" under Rule 19 but would allow supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs permissively joined under Rule 20. The omission of Rule 20 plaintiffs from the list of exceptions in \u00a7 1367(b) may have been an \"unintentional drafting gap,\" <i>Meritcare,</i> 166 F. 3d, at 221, and n. 6. If that is the case, it is up to Congress rather than the courts to fix it. The omission may seem odd, but it is not absurd. An alternative explanation for the different treatment of Rules 19 and 20 is that Congress was concerned that extending supplemental jurisdiction to Rule 19 plaintiffs would allow circumvention of the complete diversity rule: A nondiverse plaintiff might be omitted intentionally from the original action, but joined later under Rule 19 as a necessary party. See <i>Stromberg Metal Works,</i> 77 F. 3d, at 932. The contamination theory described above, if applicable, means this ruse would fail, but Congress may have wanted to make assurance double sure. More generally, Congress may have concluded that federal jurisdiction is only appropriate if the district court would have original jurisdiction over the claims of all those plaintiffs who are so essential to the action that they could be joined under Rule 19.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*566</span> To the extent that the omission of Rule 20 plaintiffs from the list of \u00a7 1367(b) exceptions is anomalous, moreover, it is no more anomalous than the inclusion of Rule 19 plaintiffs in that list would be if the alternative view of \u00a7 1367(a) were to prevail. If the district court lacks original jurisdiction over a civil diversity action where any plaintiff's claims fail to comply with all the requirements of \u00a7 1332, there is no need for a special \u00a7 1367(b) exception for Rule 19 plaintiffs who do not meet these requirements. Though the omission of Rule 20 plaintiffs from \u00a7 1367(b) presents something of a puzzle on our view of the statute, the inclusion of Rule 19 plaintiffs in this section is at least as difficult to explain under the alternative view.</p>\n<p>And so we circle back to the original question. When the well-pleaded complaint in district court includes multiple claims, all part of the same case or controversy, and some, but not all, of the claims are within the court's original jurisdiction, does the court have before it \"any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction\"? It does. Under \u00a7 1367, the court has original jurisdiction over the civil action comprising the claims for which there is no jurisdictional defect. No other reading of \u00a7 1367 is plausible in light of the text and structure of the jurisdictional statute. Though the special nature and purpose of the diversity requirement mean that a single nondiverse party can contaminate every other claim in the lawsuit, the contamination does not occur with respect to jurisdictional defects that go only to the substantive importance of individual claims.</p>\n<p>It follows from this conclusion that the threshold requirement of \u00a7 1367(a) is satisfied in cases, like those now before us, where some, but not all, of the plaintiffs in a diversity action allege a sufficient amount in controversy. We hold that \u00a7 1367 by its plain text overruled <i>Clark</i> and <i>Zahn</i> and authorized supplemental jurisdiction over all claims by diverse parties arising out of the same Article III case or controversy, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*567</span> subject only to enumerated exceptions not applicable in the cases now before us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The proponents of the alternative view of \u00a7 1367 insist that the statute is at least ambiguous and that we should look to other interpretive tools, including the legislative history of \u00a7 1367, which supposedly demonstrate Congress did not intend \u00a7 1367 to overrule <i>Zahn.</i> We can reject this argument at the very outset simply because \u00a7 1367 is not ambiguous. For the reasons elaborated above, interpreting \u00a7 1367 to foreclose supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs in diversity cases who do not meet the minimum amount in controversy is inconsistent with the text, read in light of other statutory provisions and our established jurisprudence. Even if we were to stipulate, however, that the reading these proponents urge upon us is textually plausible, the legislative history cited to support it would not alter our view as to the best interpretation of \u00a7 1367.</p>\n<p>Those who urge that the legislative history refutes our interpretation rely primarily on the House Judiciary Committee Report on the Judicial Improvements Act. H. R. Rep. No. 101-734 (1990) (House Report or Report). This Report explained that \u00a7 1367 would \"authorize jurisdiction in a case like <i>Finley,</i> as well as essentially restore the pre-<i>Finley</i> understandings of the authorization for and limits on other forms of supplemental jurisdiction.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 28. The Report stated that \u00a7 1367(a) \"generally authorizes the district court to exercise jurisdiction over a supplemental claim whenever it forms part of the same constitutional case or controversy as the claim or claims that provide the basis of the district court's original jurisdiction,\" and in so doing codifies <i>Gibbs</i> and fills the statutory gap recognized in <i>Finley.</i> House Report, at 28-29, and n. 15. The Report then remarked that \u00a7 1367(b) \"is not intended to affect the jurisdictional requirements of [\u00a7 1332] in diversity-only class <span class=\"star-pagination\">*568</span> actions, as those requirements were interpreted prior to <i>Finley,</i>\" citing, without further elaboration, <i>Zahn</i> and <i>Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur</i> v. <i>Cauble,</i> 255 U. S. 356 (1921). House Report, at 29, and n. 17. The Report noted that the \"net effect\" of \u00a7 1367(b) was to implement the \"principal rationale\" of <i>Kroger,</i> House Report, at 29, and n. 16, effecting only \"one small change\" in pre-<i>Finley</i> practice with respect to diversity actions: \u00a7 1367(b) would exclude \"Rule 23(a) plaintiff-intervenors to the same extent as those sought to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19.\" House Report, at 29. (It is evident that the report here meant to refer to Rule 24, not Rule 23.)</p>\n<p>As we have repeatedly held, the authoritative statement is the statutory text, not the legislative history or any other extrinsic material. Extrinsic materials have a role in statutory interpretation only to the extent they shed a reliable light on the enacting Legislature's understanding of otherwise ambiguous terms. Not all extrinsic materials are reliable sources of insight into legislative understandings, however, and legislative history in particular is vulnerable to two serious criticisms. First, legislative history is itself often murky, ambiguous, and contradictory. Judicial investigation of legislative history has a tendency to become, to borrow Judge Leventhal's memorable phrase, an exercise in \"`looking over a crowd and picking out your friends.'\" See Wald, Some Observations on the Use of Legislative History in the 1981 Supreme Court Term, 68 Iowa L. Rev. 195, 214 (1983). Second, judicial reliance on legislative materials like committee reports, which are not themselves subject to the requirements of Article I, may give unrepresentative committee members\u0097or, worse yet, unelected staffers and lobbyists\u0097 both the power and the incentive to attempt strategic manipulations of legislative history to secure results they were unable to achieve through the statutory text. We need not comment here on whether these problems are sufficiently prevalent to render legislative history inherently unreliable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*569</span> in all circumstances, a point on which Members of this Court have disagreed. It is clear, however, that in this instance both criticisms are right on the mark.</p>\n<p>First of all, the legislative history of \u00a7 1367 is far murkier than selective quotation from the House Report would suggest. The text of \u00a7 1367 is based substantially on a draft proposal contained in a Federal Court Study Committee working paper, which was drafted by a Subcommittee chaired by Judge Posner. Report of the Subcommittee on the Role of the Federal Courts and Their Relationship to the States 567-568 (Mar. 12, 1990), reprinted in 1 Judicial Conference of the United States, Federal Courts Study Committee, Working Papers and Subcommittee Reports (July 1, 1990) (Subcommittee Working Paper). See also Judicial Conference of the United States, Report of the Federal Courts Study Committee 47-48 (Apr. 2, 1990) (Study Committee Report) (echoing, in brief summary form, the Subcommittee Working Paper proposal and noting that the Subcommittee Working Paper \"contains additional material on this subject\"); House Report, at 27 (\"[Section 1367] implements a recommendation of the Federal Courts Study Committee found on pages 47 and 48 of its Report\"). While the Subcommittee explained, in language echoed by the House Report, that its proposal \"basically restores the law as it existed prior to <i>Finley,</i>\" Subcommittee Working Paper, at 561, it observed in a footnote that its proposal would overrule <i>Zahn</i> and that this would be a good idea, Subcommittee Working Paper, at 561, n. 33. Although the Federal Courts Study Committee did not expressly adopt the Subcommittee's specific reference to <i>Zahn,</i> it neither explicitly disagreed with the Subcommittee's conclusion that this was the best reading of the proposed text nor substantially modified the proposal to avoid this result. Study Committee Report, at 47-48. Therefore, even if the House Report could fairly be read to reflect an understanding that the text of \u00a7 1367 did not overrule <i>Zahn,</i> the Subcommittee Working Paper on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*570</span> which \u00a7 1367 was based reflected the opposite understanding. The House Report is no more authoritative than the Subcommittee Working Paper. The utility of either can extend no further than the light it sheds on how the enacting Legislature understood the statutory text. Trying to figure out how to square the Subcommittee Working Paper's understanding with the House Report's understanding, or which is more reflective of the understanding of the enacting legislators, is a hopeless task.</p>\n<p>Second, the worst fears of critics who argue legislative history will be used to circumvent the Article I process were realized in this case. The telltale evidence is the statement, by three law professors who participated in drafting \u00a7 1367, see House Report, at 27, n. 13, that \u00a7 1367 \"on its face\" permits \"supplemental jurisdiction over claims of class members that do not satisfy section 1332's jurisdictional amount requirement, which would overrule <i>[Zahn].</i> [There is] a disclaimer of intent to accomplish this result in the legislative history. . . . It would have been better had the statute dealt explicitly with this problem, and the legislative history was an attempt to correct the oversight.\" Rowe, Burbank, &amp; Mengler, Compounding or Creating Confusion About Supplemental Jurisdiction? A Reply to Professor Freer, 40 Emory L. J. 943, 960, n. 90 (1991). The professors were frank to concede that if one refuses to consider the legislative history, one has no choice but to \"conclude that section 1367 has wiped <i>Zahn</i> off the books.\" <i>Ibid.</i> So there exists an acknowledgment, by parties who have detailed, specific knowledge of the statute and the drafting process, both that the plain text of \u00a7 1367 overruled <i>Zahn</i> and that language to the contrary in the House Report was a <i>post hoc</i> attempt to alter that result. One need not subscribe to the wholesale condemnation of legislative history to refuse to give any effect to such a deliberate effort to amend a statute through a committee report.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*571</span> In sum, even if we believed resort to legislative history were appropriate in these cases\u0097a point we do not concede\u0097we would not give significant weight to the House Report. The distinguished jurists who drafted the Subcommittee Working Paper, along with three of the participants in the drafting of \u00a7 1367, agree that this provision, on its face, overrules <i>Zahn.</i> This accords with the best reading of the statute's text, and nothing in the legislative history indicates directly and explicitly that Congress understood the phrase \"civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction\" to exclude cases in which some but not all of the diversity plaintiffs meet the amount-in-controversy requirement.</p>\n<p>No credence, moreover, can be given to the claim that, if Congress understood \u00a7 1367 to overrule <i>Zahn,</i> the proposal would have been more controversial. We have little sense whether any Member of Congress would have been particularly upset by this result. This is not a case where one can plausibly say that concerned legislators might not have realized the possible effect of the text they were adopting. Certainly, any competent legislative aide who studied the matter would have flagged this issue if it were a matter of importance to his or her boss, especially in light of the Subcommittee Working Paper. There are any number of reasons why legislators did not spend more time arguing over \u00a7 1367, none of which are relevant to our interpretation of what the words of the statute mean.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>Finally, we note that the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA), Pub. L. 109-2, 119 Stat. 4, enacted this year, has no bearing on our analysis of these cases. Subject to certain limitations, the CAFA confers federal diversity jurisdiction over class actions where the aggregate amount in controversy exceeds $5 million. It abrogates the rule against aggregating claims, a rule this Court recognized in <i>Ben-Hur</i> and reaffirmed in <i>Zahn.</i> The CAFA, however, is not retroactive, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*572</span> and the views of the 2005 Congress are not relevant to our interpretation of a text enacted by Congress in 1990. The CAFA, moreover, does not moot the significance of our interpretation of \u00a7 1367, as many proposed exercises of supplemental jurisdiction, even in the class-action context, might not fall within the CAFA's ambit. The CAFA, then, has no impact, one way or the other, on our interpretation of \u00a7 1367.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is affirmed. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE GINSBURG's carefully reasoned opinion, <i>post,</i> at 577 (dissenting opinion), demonstrates the error in the Court's rather ambitious reading of this opaque jurisdictional statute. She also has demonstrated that \"ambiguity\" is a term that may have different meanings for different judges, for the Court has made the remarkable declaration that its reading of the statute is so obviously correct\u0097and JUSTICE GINSBURG'S so obviously wrong\u0097that the text does not even qualify as \"ambiguous.\" See <i>ante,</i> at 567. Because ambiguity is apparently in the eye of the beholder, I remain convinced that it is unwise to treat the ambiguity <i>vel non</i> of a statute as determinative of whether legislative history is consulted. Indeed, I believe that we as judges are more, rather than less, constrained when we make ourselves accountable to <i>all</i> reliable evidence of legislative intent. See <i>Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc.</i> v. <i>Nigh,</i> 543 U. S. 50, 65-66, and n. 1 (2004) (Stevens, J., concurring).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*573</span> The legislative history of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1367 provides powerful confirmation of JUSTICE GINSBURG'S interpretation of that statute. It is helpful to consider in full the relevant portion of the House Report, which was also adopted by the Senate:</p>\n<blockquote>\"This section would authorize jurisdiction in a case like <i>Finley</i> [v. <i>United States,</i> 490 U. S. 545 (1989)], as well as essentially restore the pre-<i>Finley</i> understandings of the authorization for and limits on other forms of supplemental jurisdiction. In federal question cases, it broadly authorizes the district courts to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims, including claims involving the joinder of additional parties. In diversity cases, the district courts may exercise supplemental jurisdiction, except when doing so would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of the diversity statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Subsection 114(b) [\u00a7 1367(b)] prohibits a district court in a case over which it has jurisdiction founded solely on the general diversity provision, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1332, from exercising supplemental jurisdiction in specified circumstances. [Footnote 16: `The net effect of subsection (b) is to implement the principal rationale of <i>Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co.</i> v. <i>Kroger,</i> 437 U. S. 365 (1978)'.] In diversity-only actions the district courts may not hear plaintiffs' supplemental claims when exercising supplemental jurisdiction would encourage plaintiffs to evade the jurisdictional requirement of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1332 by the simple expedient of naming initially only those defendants whose joinder satisfies section 1332's requirements and later adding claims not within original federal jurisdiction against other defendants who have intervened or been joined on a supplemental basis. In accord with case law, the subsection <span class=\"star-pagination\">*574</span> also prohibits the joinder or intervention of persons or plaintiffs if adding them is inconsistent with section 1332's requirements. The section is not intended to affect the jurisdictional requirements of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1332 in diversity-only class actions, as those requirements were interpreted prior to Finley. [Footnote 17: `See <i>Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur</i> v. <i>Cauble,</i> 255 U. S. 356 (1921); <i>Zahn</i> v. <i>International Paper Co.,</i> 414 U. S. 291 (1973)'.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Subsection (b) makes one small change in pre-<i>Finley</i> practice. Anomalously, under current practice, the same party might intervene as of right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and take advantage of supplemental jurisdiction, but not come within supplemental jurisdiction if parties already in the action sought to effect the joinder under Rule 19. Subsection (b) would eliminate this anomaly, excluding Rule 23(a) plaintiff-intervenors to the same extent as those sought to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19.\" H. R. Rep. No. 101-734, pp. 28-29 (1990) (footnote omitted) (hereinafter House Report or Report).<sup>[1]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Not only does the House Report specifically say that \u00a7 1367 was not intended to upset <i>Zahn</i> v. <i>International Paper Co.,</i> 414 U. S. 291 (1973), but its entire explanation of the statute demonstrates that Congress had in mind a very specific and relatively modest task\u0097undoing this Court's 5-to-4 decision in <i>Finley</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 490 U. S. 545 (1989). In addition to overturning that unfortunate and much-criticized decision,<sup>[2]</sup> the statute, according to the Report, codifies and preserves \"the pre-<i>Finley</i> understandings of the authorization <span class=\"star-pagination\">*575</span> for and limits on other forms of supplemental jurisdiction,\" House Report, at 28, with the exception of making \"one small change in pre-<i>Finley</i> practice,\" <i>id.,</i> at 29, which is not relevant here.</p>\n<p>The sweeping purpose that the Court's decision imputes to Congress bears no resemblance to the House Report's description of the statute. But this does not seem to trouble the Court, for its decision today treats statutory interpretation as a pedantic exercise, divorced from any serious attempt at ascertaining congressional intent. Of course, there are situations in which we do not honor Congress' apparent intent unless that intent is made \"clear\" in the text of a statute\u0097in this way, we can be certain that Congress considered the issue and intended a disfavored outcome, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Landgraf</i> v. <i>USI Film Products,</i> 511 U. S. 244 (1994) (requiring clear statement for retroactive civil legislation). But that principle provides no basis for discounting the House Report, given that our cases have never recognized a presumption in <i>favor</i> of expansive diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>The Court's reasons for ignoring this virtual billboard of congressional intent are unpersuasive. That a subcommittee of the Federal Courts Study Committee believed that an earlier, substantially similar version of the statute overruled <i>Zahn,</i> see <i>ante,</i> at 569, only highlights the fact that the statute is ambiguous. What is determinative is that the House Report explicitly rejected that broad reading of the statutory text. Such a report has special significance as an indicator of legislative intent. In Congress, committee reports are normally considered the authoritative explication of a statute's text and purposes, and busy legislators and their assistants rely on that explication in casting their votes. Cf. <i>Garcia</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 469 U. S. 70, 76 (1984) (\"In surveying legislative history we have repeatedly stated that the authoritative source for finding the Legislature's intent lies in the Committee Reports on the bill, which `represen[t] the considered and collective understanding of those Congressmen <span class=\"star-pagination\">*576</span> involved in drafting and studying proposed legislation'\" (quoting <i>Zuber</i> v. <i>Allen,</i> 396 U. S. 168, 186 (1969); brackets in original)).</p>\n<p>The Court's second reason\u0097its comment on the three law professors who participated in drafting \u00a7 1367, see <i>ante,</i> at 570\u0097is similarly off the mark. In the law review article that the Court refers to, the professors were merely saying that the text of the statute was susceptible to an overly broad (and simplistic) reading, and that clarification in the House Report was therefore appropriate. See Rowe, Burbank, &amp; Mengler, Compounding or Creating Confusion About Supplemental Jurisdiction? A Reply to Professor Freer, 40 Emory L. J. 943, 960, n. 90 (1991).<sup>[3]</sup> Significantly, the reference to <i>Zahn</i> in the House Report does not at all appear to be tacked on or out of place; indeed, it is wholly consistent with the Report's broader explanation of Congress' goal of overruling <i>Finley</i> and preserving pre-<i>Finley</i> law. To suggest that these professors participated in a \"deliberate effort to amend a statute through a committee report,\" <i>ante,</i> at 570, reveals an unrealistic view of the legislative process, not to mention disrespect for three law professors who acted in the role of public servants. To be sure, legislative history can be manipulated. But, in the situation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*577</span> before us, there is little reason to fear that an unholy conspiracy of \"unrepresentative committee members,\" <i>ante,</i> at 568, law professors, and \"unelected staffers and lobbyists,\" <i>ibid.,</i> endeavored to torpedo Congress' attempt to overrule (without discussion) two longstanding features of this Court's diversity jurisprudence.</p>\n<p>After nearly 20 pages of complicated analysis, which explores subtle doctrinal nuances and coins various neologisms, the Court announces that \u00a7 1367 could not reasonably be read another way. See <i>ante,</i> at 567. That conclusion is difficult to accept. Given JUSTICE GINSBURG'S persuasive account of the statutory text and its jurisprudential backdrop, and given the uncommonly clear legislative history, I am confident that the majority's interpretation of \u00a7 1367 is mistaken. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE O'CONNOR, and JUSTICE BREYER join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>These cases present the question whether Congress, by enacting 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1367, overruled this Court's decisions in <i>Clark</i> v. <i>Paul Gray, Inc.,</i> 306 U. S. 583, 589 (1939) (reaffirming the holding of <i>Troy Bank</i> v. <i>G. A. Whitehead &amp; Co.,</i> 222 U. S. 39, 40 (1911)), and <i>Zahn</i> v. <i>International Paper Co.,</i> 414 U. S. 291 (1973). <i>Clark</i> held that, when federal-court jurisdiction is predicated on a specified amount in controversy, each plaintiff joined in the litigation must independently meet the jurisdictional amount requirement. <i>Zahn</i> confirmed that in class actions governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), \"[e]ach [class member] . . . must satisfy the jurisdictional amount, and any [class member] who does not must be dismissed from the case.\" 414 U. S., at 301.</p>\n<p>Section 1367, all agree, was designed to overturn this Court's decision in <i>Finley</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 490 U. S. 545 (1989). <i>Finley</i> concerned not diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction (28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1332), but original federal-court jurisdiction in cases arising under federal law (28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1331). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*578</span> The plaintiff in <i>Finley</i> sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1346(b), to recover for the death of her husband and children in an airplane crash. She alleged that the Federal Aviation Administration's negligence contributed to the fatal accident. She later amended her complaint to add state-law tort claims against two other defendants, a municipality and a utility company. 490 U. S., at 546-547. No independent basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction existed over the state-law claims. The plaintiff could not have brought her entire action in state court, because federal jurisdiction in FTCA actions is exclusive. \u00a7 1346(b). Hence, absent federal jurisdiction embracing the state-law claims, she would be obliged to pursue two discrete actions, one in federal court, the other in state court. This Court held, nevertheless, that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the \"pendent-party\" state-law claims. <i>Id.,</i> at 555-556. In so holding, the Court stressed that Congress held the control rein. <i>Id.,</i> at 547-549. Congress could reverse the result in <i>Finley,</i> and permit pendent jurisdiction over state-law claims against additional defendants, if it so chose. <i>Id.,</i> at 556. Congress did so in \u00a7 1367.</p>\n<p>What more \u00a7 1367 wrought is an issue on which courts of appeals have sharply divided. Compare <i>Stromberg Metal Works, Inc.</i> v. <i>Press Mechanical, Inc.,</i> 77 F. 3d 928, 930 (CA7 1996) (\u00a7 1367 \"supersedes <i>Clark</i> and allows pendent-party jurisdiction when the additional parties have claims worth less than [the jurisdictional minimum]\"), and <i>In re Abbott Labs.,</i> 51 F. 3d 524, 529 (CA5 1995) (\"[U]nder \u00a7 1367 a district court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over members of a class, although they did not meet the amount-in-controversy requirement, as did the class representatives.\"), with <i>Meritcare Inc.</i> v. <i>St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co.,</i> 166 F. 3d 214, 222 (CA3 1999) (\u00a7 1367 \"preserves the prohibition against aggregation outlined in <i>[Zahn</i> and <i>Clark]</i>\"), and <i>Leonhardt</i> v. <i>Western Sugar Co.,</i> 160 F. 3d 631, 641 (CA10 1998) (\u00a7 1367 does not alter \"the historical rules prohibiting aggregation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*579</span> of claims, including <i>Zahn</i>'s prohibition of such aggregation in diversity class actions\"). The Court today holds that \u00a7 1367, although prompted by <i>Finley,</i> a case in which original access to federal court was predicated on a federal question, notably enlarges federal diversity jurisdiction. The Court reads \u00a7 1367 to overrule <i>Clark</i> and <i>Zahn,</i> thereby allowing access to federal court by coplaintiffs or class members who do not meet the now in excess of $75,000 amount-in-controversy requirement, so long as at least one coplaintiff, or the named class representative, has a jurisdictionally sufficient claim. <i>Ante,</i> at 549.</p>\n<p>The Court adopts a plausibly broad reading of \u00a7 1367, a measure that is hardly a model of the careful drafter's art. There is another plausible reading, however, one less disruptive of our jurisprudence regarding supplemental jurisdiction. If one reads \u00a7 1367(a) to instruct, as the statute's text suggests, that the district court must first have \"original jurisdiction\" over a \"civil action\" before supplemental jurisdiction can attach, then <i>Clark</i> and <i>Zahn</i> are preserved, and supplemental jurisdiction does not open the way for joinder of plaintiffs, or inclusion of class members, who do not independently meet the amount-in-controversy requirement. For the reasons that follow, I conclude that this narrower construction is the better reading of \u00a7 1367.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Section 1367, captioned \"Supplemental jurisdiction,\" codifies court-recognized doctrines formerly labeled \"pendent\" and \"ancillary\" jurisdiction. Pendent jurisdiction involved the enlargement of federal-question litigation to include related state-law claims. Ancillary jurisdiction evolved primarily to protect defending parties, or others whose rights might be adversely affected if they could not air their claims in an ongoing federal-court action. Given jurisdiction over the principal action, federal courts entertained certain matters <span class=\"star-pagination\">*580</span> deemed ancillary regardless of the citizenship of the parties or the amount in controversy.</p>\n<p><i>Mine Workers</i> v. <i>Gibbs,</i> 383 U. S. 715 (1966), the leading pendent jurisdiction case, involved a claim against a union for wrongfully inducing the plaintiff's discharge. The plaintiff stated a federal claim under the Taft-Hartley Act, and an allied state-law claim of unlawful conspiracy to interfere with his employment contract. This Court upheld the joinder of federal and state claims. \"[T]here is <i>power</i> in federal courts to hear the whole,\" the Court said, when the state and federal claims \"derive from a common nucleus of operative fact\" and are so linked that the plaintiff \"would ordinarily be expected to try them all in one judicial proceeding.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 725.</p>\n<p><i>Gibbs</i> involved the linkage of federal and state claims against the same defendant. In <i>Finley</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 490 U. S. 545, the Court contained <i>Gibbs.</i> Without congressional authorization, the Court admonished, the pendent jurisdiction umbrella could not be stretched to cover the joinder of additional parties. <i>Gibbs</i> had departed from earlier decisions recognizing that \"jurisdiction [must] be explicitly conferred,\" the Court said. 490 U. S., at 556. <i>Aldinger</i> v. <i>Howard,</i> 427 U. S. 1 (1976), the Court observed, although resting \"on a much narrower basis,\" R. Fallon, D. Meltzer, &amp; D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 925 (5th ed. 2003) (hereinafter Hart &amp; Wechsler), had already signaled that \"the <i>Gibbs</i> approach would not be extended to the pendent-party field,\" <i>Finley,</i> 490 U. S., at 556. While the <i>Finley</i> Court did not \"limit or impair\" <i>Gibbs</i> itself, 490 U. S., at 556, for further development of pendent jurisdiction, the Court made it plain, the initiative would lie in Congress' domain, <i>id.,</i> at 555-556.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*581</span> Ancillary jurisdiction, which evolved as a more sprawling doctrine than pendent jurisdiction, was originally rooted in \"the notion that [when] federal jurisdiction in [a] principal suit effectively controls the property or fund under dispute, other claimants thereto should be allowed to intervene in order to protect their interests, without regard to jurisdiction.\" <i>Aldinger,</i> 427 U. S., at 11; see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Freeman</i> v. <i>Howe,</i> 24 How. 450 (1861). In <i>Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co.</i> v. <i>Kroger,</i> 437 U. S. 365 (1978), the Court addressed the permissible scope of the doctrine in relation to the liberal provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for joinder of parties and claims.</p>\n<p><i>Kroger</i> commenced as a suit between a citizen of Iowa and a Nebraska corporation. When the Nebraska defendant impleaded an Iowa corporation as a third-party defendant under Rule 14(a), the plaintiff asserted state-law claims against the impleaded party. No independent basis of federal jurisdiction existed over the newly asserted claims, for both plaintiff and impleaded defendant were citizens of Iowa. 437 U. S., at 370. The Court held that the plaintiff could not draw in a co-citizen defendant in this manner. <i>Id.,</i> at 377. Federal courts, by the time of <i>Kroger,</i> were routinely exercising ancillary jurisdiction over compulsory counterclaims, impleader claims, cross-claims among defendants, and claims of parties who intervened \"of right.\" See <i>id.,</i> at 375, n. 18 (collecting cases). In <i>Kroger,</i> however,</p>\n<blockquote>\"the nonfederal claim . . . was asserted by the plaintiff, who voluntarily chose to bring suit upon a state-law claim in a federal court. By contrast, ancillary jurisdiction typically involve[d] claims by a defending party haled into court against his will, or by another person whose rights might be irretrievably lost unless he could <span class=\"star-pagination\">*582</span> assert them in an ongoing action in a federal court.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 376.</blockquote>\n<p>Having \"chosen the federal rather than the state forum,\" the Court said, the plaintiff had to \"accept its limitations.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>In sum, in federal-question cases before \u00a7 1367's enactment, the Court recognized pendent-claim jurisdiction, <i>Gibbs,</i> 383 U. S., at 725, but not pendent-party jurisdiction, <i>Finley,</i> 490 U. S., at 555-556. As to ancillary jurisdiction, the Court adhered to the limitation that in diversity cases, throughout the litigation, all plaintiffs must remain diverse from all defendants. See <i>Kroger,</i> 437 U. S., at 374.</p>\n<p>Although pendent jurisdiction and ancillary jurisdiction evolved discretely,<sup>[2]</sup> the Court has recognized that they are \"two species of the same generic problem: Under what circumstances may a federal court hear and decide a state-law claim arising between citizens of the same State?\" <i>Id.,</i> at 370. <i>Finley</i> regarded that question as one properly addressed to Congress. See 490 U. S., at 549, 556; 13 Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 3523, p. 127 (2d ed., Supp. 2005); Hart &amp; Wechsler 924-926.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Shortly before the Court decided <i>Finley,</i> Congress had established the Federal Courts Study Committee to take up issues relating to \"the federal courts' congestion, delay, expense, and expansion.\" Judicial Conference of the United States, Report of the Federal Courts Study Committee 3 (Apr. 2, 1990) (hereinafter Committee Report). The Committee's charge was to conduct a study addressing the \"crisis\" in federal courts caused by the \"rapidly growing\" caseload. <i>Id.,</i> at 6 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*583</span> Among recommendations, the Committee urged Congress to \"authorize federal courts to assert pendent jurisdiction over parties without an independent federal jurisdictional base.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 47. If adopted, this recommendation would overrule <i>Finley.</i> Earlier, a Subcommittee had recommended that Congress overrule both <i>Finley</i> and <i>Zahn.</i> Report of the Subcommittee on the Role of the Federal Courts and Their Relationship to the States 547, 561, n. 33 (Mar. 12, 1990), reprinted in 1 Judicial Conference of the United States, Federal Courts Study Committee, Working Papers and Subcommittee Reports (July 1, 1990) (hereinafter Subcommittee Report). In the Subcommittee's view, \"[f]rom a policy standpoint,\" <i>Zahn</i> \"ma[de] little sense.\" Subcommittee Report, at 561, n. 33.<sup>[3]</sup> The full Committee, however, urged only the overruling of <i>Finley</i> and did not adopt the recommendation to overrule <i>Zahn.</i> Committee Report, at 47-48.</p>\n<p>As a separate matter, a substantial majority of the Committee \"strongly recommend[ed]\" the elimination of diversity jurisdiction, save for \"complex multi-state litigation, interpleader, and suits involving aliens.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 38-39; accord Subcommittee Report, at 454-458. \"[N]o other step,\" the Committee's Report maintained, \"will do anywhere nearly as much to reduce federal caseload pressures and contain the growth of the federal judiciary.\" Committee Report, at 39.</p>\n<p>Congress responded by adopting, as part of the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 5089,<sup>[4]</sup> recommendations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*584</span> of the Federal Courts Study Committee ranked by the House Committee on the Judiciary as \"modest\" and \"noncontroversial.\" H. R. Rep. No. 101-734, pp. 15-16 (1990) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.); see also 136 Cong. Rec. 36288 (1990). Congress did not take up the Study Committee's immodest proposal to curtail diversity jurisdiction. It did, however, enact a supplemental jurisdiction statute, codified as 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1367.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Section 1367, by its terms, operates only in civil actions \"of which the district courts have original jurisdiction.\" The \"original jurisdiction\" relevant here is diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction, conferred by \u00a7 1332. The character of that jurisdiction is the essential backdrop for comprehension of \u00a7 1367.</p>\n<p>The Constitution broadly provides for federal-court jurisdiction in controversies \"between Citizens of different States.\" Art. III, \u00a7 2, cl. 1. This Court has read that provision to demand no more than \"minimal diversity,\" <i>i. e.,</i> so long as one party on the plaintiffs' side and one party on the defendants' side are of diverse citizenship, Congress may authorize federal courts to exercise diversity jurisdiction. See <i>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co.</i> v. <i>Tashire,</i> 386 U. S. 523, 530-531 (1967). Further, the Constitution includes no amount-in-controversy limitation on the exercise of federal jurisdiction. But from the start, Congress, as its measures have been construed by this Court, has limited federal-court exercise of diversity jurisdiction in two principal ways. First, unless Congress specifies otherwise, diversity must be \"complete,\" <i>i. e.,</i> all parties on plaintiffs' side must be diverse from all parties on defendants' side. <i>Strawbridge</i> v. <i>Curtiss,</i> 3 Cranch 267 (1806); see 13B Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 3605 (2d ed. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*585</span> 1984). Second, each plaintiff's stake must independently meet the amount-in-controversy specification: \"When two or more plaintiffs, having separate and distinct demands, unite for convenience and economy in a single suit, it is essential that the demand of each be of the requisite jurisdictional amount.\" <i>Troy Bank,</i> 222 U. S., at 40.</p>\n<p>The statute today governing federal-court exercise of diversity jurisdiction in the generality of cases, \u00a7 1332, like all its predecessors, incorporates both a diverse-citizenship requirement and an amount-in-controversy specification.<sup>[5]</sup> As to the latter, the statute reads: \"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction [in diversity-of-citizenship cases] where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum . . . of $75,000.\" \u00a7 1332(a). This Court has long held that, in determining whether the amount-in-controversy requirement has been satisfied, a single plaintiff may aggregate two or more claims against a single defendant, even if the claims are unrelated. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Edwards</i> v. <i>Bates County,</i> 163 U. S. 269, 273 (1896). But in multiparty cases, including class actions, we have unyieldingly adhered to the nonaggregation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*586</span> rule stated in <i>Troy Bank.</i> See <i>Clark,</i> 306 U. S., at 589 (reaffirming the \"familiar rule that when several plaintiffs assert separate and distinct demands in a single suit, the amount involved in each separate controversy must be of the requisite amount to be within the jurisdiction of the district court, and that those amounts cannot be added together to satisfy jurisdictional requirements\"); <i>Snyder</i> v. <i>Harris,</i> 394 U. S. 332, 339-340 (1969) (abandonment of the nonaggregation rule in class actions would undercut the congressional \"purpose . . . to check, to some degree, the rising caseload of the federal courts\").</p>\n<p>This Court most recently addressed \"[t]he meaning of [\u00a7 1332's] `matter in controversy' language\" in <i>Zahn,</i> 414 U. S., at 298. <i>Zahn,</i> like <i>Snyder</i> decided four years earlier, was a class action. In <i>Snyder,</i> no class member had a claim large enough to satisfy the jurisdictional amount. But in <i>Zahn,</i> the named plaintiffs had such claims. 414 U. S., at 292. Nevertheless, the Court declined to depart from its \"longstanding construction of the `matter in controversy' requirement of \u00a7 1332.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 301. The <i>Zahn</i> Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"<i>Snyder</i> invoked the well-established rule that each of several plaintiffs asserting separate and distinct claims must satisfy the jurisdictional-amount requirement if his claim is to survive a motion to dismiss. This rule plainly mandates not only that there may be no aggregation and that the entire case must be dismissed where none of the plaintiffs claims [meets the amount-in-controversy requirement] but also requires that any plaintiff without the jurisdictional amount must be dismissed from the case, even though others allege jurisdictionally sufficient claims.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 300.</blockquote>\n<p>The rule that each plaintiff must independently satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement, unless Congress expressly orders otherwise, was thus the solidly established <span class=\"star-pagination\">*587</span> reading of \u00a7 1332 when Congress enacted the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990, which added \u00a7 1367 to Title 28.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>These cases present the question whether Congress abrogated the nonaggregation rule long tied to \u00a7 1332 when it enacted \u00a7 1367. In answering that question, \"context [should provide] a crucial guide.\" <i>Rosario Ortega</i> v. <i>Star-Kist Foods, Inc.,</i> 370 F. 3d 124, 135 (CA1 2004). The Court should assume, as it ordinarily does, that Congress legislated against a background of law already in place and the historical development of that law. See <i>National Archives and Records Admin.</i> v. <i>Favish,</i> 541 U. S. 157, 169 (2004). Here, that background is the statutory grant of diversity jurisdiction, the amount-in-controversy condition that Congress, from the start, has tied to the grant, and the nonaggregation rule this Court has long applied to the determination of the \"matter in controversy.\"</p>\n<p>Section 1367(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution. Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The Court is unanimous in reading \u00a7 1367(a) to permit pendent-party jurisdiction in federal-question cases, and thus, to overrule <i>Finley.</i> The basic jurisdictional grant, \u00a7 1331, provides that \"[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*588</span> laws, or treaties of the United States.\" Since 1980, \u00a7 1331 has contained no amount-in-controversy requirement. See 94 Stat. 2369 (eliminating \u00a7 1331's amount-in-controversy requirement). Once there is a civil action presenting a qualifying claim arising under federal law, \u00a7 1331's sole requirement is met. District courts, we have held, may then adjudicate, additionally, state-law claims \"deriv[ing] from a common nucleus of operative fact.\" <i>Gibbs,</i> 383 U. S., at 725. Section 1367(a) enlarges that category to include not only state-law claims against the defendant named in the federal claim, but also \"[state-law] claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.\"<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court divides, however, on the impact of \u00a7 1367(a) on diversity cases controlled by \u00a7 1332. Under the majority's reading, \u00a7 1367(a) permits the joinder of related claims cut loose from the nonaggregation rule that has long attended actions under \u00a7 1332. Only the claims specified in \u00a7 1367(b)<sup>[7]</sup> would be excluded from \u00a7 1367(a)'s expansion of \u00a7 1332's grant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*589</span> of diversity jurisdiction. And because \u00a7 1367(b) contains no exception for joinder of plaintiffs under Rule 20 or class actions under Rule 23, the Court concludes, <i>Clark</i> and <i>Zahn</i> have been overruled.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court's reading is surely plausible, especially if one detaches \u00a7 1367(a) from its context and attempts no reconciliation with prior interpretations of \u00a7 1332's amount-incontroversy requirement. But \u00a7 1367(a)'s text, as the First Circuit held, can be read another way, one that would involve no rejection of <i>Clark</i> and <i>Zahn.</i></p>\n<p>As explained by the First Circuit in <i>Ortega,</i> and applied to class actions by the Tenth Circuit in <i>Leonhardt,</i> see <i>supra,</i> at 578-579, \u00a7 1367(a) addresses \"civil action[s] of which the district courts have original jurisdiction,\" a formulation that, in diversity cases, is sensibly read to incorporate the rules on joinder and aggregation tightly tied to \u00a7 1332 at the time of \u00a7 1367's enactment. On this reading, a complaint must first meet that \"original jurisdiction\" measurement. If it does not, no supplemental jurisdiction is authorized. If it does, \u00a7 1367(a) authorizes \"supplemental jurisdiction\" over related claims. In other words, \u00a7 1367(a) would preserve undiminished, as part and parcel of \u00a7 1332 \"original jurisdiction\" determinations, both the \"complete diversity\" rule and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*590</span> the decisions restricting aggregation to arrive at the amount in controversy.<sup>[9]</sup> Section 1367(b)'s office, then, would be \"to prevent the erosion of the complete diversity [and amount-in-controversy] requirement[s] that might otherwise result from an expansive application of what was once termed the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction.\" See Pfander, Supplemental Jurisdiction and Section 1367: The Case for a Sympathetic Textualism, 148 U. Pa. L. Rev. 109, 114 (1999); <i>infra,</i> at 593-594. In contrast to the Court's construction of \u00a7 1367, which draws a sharp line between the diversity and amount-in-controversy components of \u00a7 1332, see <i>ante,</i> at 554; <i>supra,</i> at 585, n. 5, the interpretation presented here does not sever the two jurisdictional requirements.</p>\n<p>The more restrained reading of \u00a7 1367 just outlined would yield affirmance of the First Circuit's judgment in <i>Ortega,</i> and reversal of the Eleventh Circuit's judgment in <i>Exxon.</i> It would not discard entirely, as the Court does, the judicially developed doctrines of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction as they existed when <i>Finley</i> was decided.<sup>[10]</sup> Instead, it would recognize \u00a7 1367 essentially as a codification of those doctrines, placing them under a single heading, but largely retaining their substance, with overriding <i>Finley</i> the only basic change: Supplemental jurisdiction, once the district court has original jurisdiction, would now include \"claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.\" \u00a7 1367(a).</p>\n<p>Pendent jurisdiction, as earlier explained, see <i>supra,</i> at 579-580, applied only in federal-question cases and allowed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*591</span> plaintiffs to attach nonfederal claims to their jurisdiction-qualifying claims. Ancillary jurisdiction applied primarily, although not exclusively, in diversity cases and \"typically involve[d] claims <i>by a defending party</i> haled into court against his will.\" <i>Kroger,</i> 437 U. S., at 376 (emphasis added); see also <i>id.,</i> at 375, n. 18; <i>supra,</i> at 581-582. As the First Circuit observed, neither doctrine permitted a plaintiff to circumvent the dual requirements of \u00a7 1332 (diversity of citizenship and amount in controversy) \"simply by joining her [jurisdictionally inadequate] claim in an action brought by [a] jurisdictionally competent diversity plaintiff.\" <i>Ortega,</i> 370 F. 3d, at 138.</p>\n<p>Not only would the reading I find persuasive \"alig[n] statutory supplemental jurisdiction with the judicially developed doctrines of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction,\" <i>ibid.,</i> it would also synchronize \u00a7 1367 with the removal statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1441. As the First Circuit carefully explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Section 1441, like \u00a7 1367, applies only if the `civil action' in question is one `of which the district courts . . . have original jurisdiction.' \u00a7 1441(a). Relying on that language, the Supreme Court has interpreted \u00a7 1441 to prohibit removal unless the entire action, as it stands at the time of removal, could have been filed in federal court in the first instance. <i>See, e. g., </i><i>Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc. v. Henson,</i> 537 U. S. 28, 33 (2002); <i>Okla. Tax Comm'n v. Graham,</i> 489 U. S. 838, 840 (1989) (per curiam). Section 1441 has thus been held to incorporate the well-pleaded complaint rule, <i>see City of </i><i>Chicago</i> [v. <i>International College of Surgeons,</i> 522 U. S. 156, 163 (1997)];<sup>[11]</sup> the complete diversity rule, <i>see </i><i>Caterpillar,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*592</span> <i>Inc. v. Lewis,</i> 519 U. S. 61, 73 (1996); and rules for calculating the amount in controversy, <i>see </i><i>St. Paul Mercury Indem. Co. v. Red Cab Co.,</i> 303 U. S. 283, 291-292 (1938).\" 370 F. 3d, at 138 (citations omitted and footnote added).</blockquote>\n<p>The less disruptive view I take of \u00a7 1367 also accounts for the omission of Rule 20 plaintiffs and Rule 23 class actions in \u00a7 1367(b)'s text. If one reads \u00a7 1367(a) as a plenary grant of supplemental jurisdiction to federal courts sitting in diversity, one would indeed look for exceptions in \u00a7 1367(b). Finding none for permissive joinder of parties or class actions, one would conclude that Congress effectively, even if unintentionally, overruled <i>Clark</i> and <i>Zahn.</i> But if one recognizes that the nonaggregation rule delineated in <i>Clark</i> and <i>Zahn</i> forms part of the determination whether \"original jurisdiction\" exists in a diversity case, see <i>supra,</i> at 590, then plaintiffs who do not meet the amount-in-controversy requirement would fail at the \u00a7 1367(a) threshold. Congress would have no reason to resort to a \u00a7 1367(b) exception to turn such plaintiffs away from federal court, given that their claims, from the start, would fall outside the court's \u00a7 1332 jurisdiction. See Pfander, <i>supra,</i> at 148.</p>\n<p>Nor does the more moderate reading assign different meanings to \"original jurisdiction\" in diversity and federal-question cases. See <i>ante,</i> at 561. As the First Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"`[O]riginal jurisdiction' in \u00a7 1367(a) has the same meaning in every case: [An] underlying statutory grant of original jurisdiction must be satisfied. What differs between <span class=\"star-pagination\">*593</span> federal question and diversity cases is not the meaning of `original jurisdiction' but rather the [discrete] requirements of sections 1331 and 1332. Under \u00a7 1331, the sole issue is whether a federal question appears on the face of the plaintiff's well-pleaded complaint; the [citizenship] of the parties and the amounts they stand to recover [do not bear on that determination]. Section 1332, by contrast, predicates original jurisdiction on the identity of the parties (<i>i. e.,</i> [their] complete diversity) and their [satisfaction of the amount-in-controversy specification]. [In short,] the `original jurisdiction' language in \u00a7 1367 operates differently in federal-question and diversity cases not because the meaning of that term varies, but because the [jurisdiction-granting] statutes are different.\" 370 F. 3d, at 139-140.</blockquote>\n<p>What is the utility of \u00a7 1367(b) under my reading of \u00a7 1367(a)? Section 1367(a) allows parties other than the plaintiff to assert <i>reactive</i> claims once entertained under the heading ancillary jurisdiction. See <i>supra,</i> at 581 (listing claims, including compulsory counterclaims and impleader claims, over which federal courts routinely exercised ancillary jurisdiction). As earlier observed, see <i>supra,</i> at 590-591, \u00a7 1367(b) stops plaintiffs from circumventing \u00a7 1332's jurisdictional requirements by using another's claim as a hook to add a claim that the plaintiff could not have brought in the first instance. <i>Kroger</i> is the paradigm case. See <i>supra,</i> at 581-582. There, the Court held that ancillary jurisdiction did not extend to a plaintiff's claim against a nondiverse party who had been impleaded by the defendant under Rule 14. Section 1367(b), then, is corroborative of \u00a7 1367(a)'s coverage of claims formerly called ancillary, but provides exceptions to ensure that accommodation of added claims would not fundamentally alter \"the jurisdictional requirements of section 1332.\" See Pfander, 148 U. Pa. L.

Maynard, Mark B. Stern,</i> and <i>Alisa B.

Weiner.</i></p>\n<p>[1]  The last quoted paragraph was intended to refer to Rule 24, not Rule 23. See <i>ante,</i> at 568.</p>\n<p>[2]  As I pointed out in my dissent in <i>Finley,</i> the majority's decision was \"not faithful to our precedents,\" 490 U. S., at 558, and casually dismissed the accumulated wisdom of judges such as Henry Friendly, who had \"special learning and expertise in matters of federal jurisdiction,\" <i>id.,</i> at 565.</p>\n<p>[3]  The professors' account of the challenges they faced in drafting \u00a7 1367 gives some sense, I think, of why that statute has proved difficult to interpret: \"More broadly, codifying a complex area like supplemental jurisdiction\u0097as Professor Freer's discussion illustrates\u0097is itself complex business. A danger is that the result of the effort to deal with all the foreseeables will be a statute too prolix and baroque for everyday use and application by practitioners and judges. Section 1367 reflects an effort to provide sufficient detail without overdoing it. The statute is concededly not perfect. What it accomplishes, however, is to change the direction taken by the Supreme Court in <i>Finley,</i> to provide basic guidance (in particular the legislative history's general approval of pre-<i>Finley</i> case law, which has treated some specific issues Professor Freer raises), and then to trust the federal courts under the changed direction to interpret the statute sensibly. . . .\" 40 Emory L. J., at 961.</p>\n<p>[1]  \"[B]oth the Finley result and its implications\" sparked \"considerable criticism.\" Hart &amp; Wechsler 926; see also 13B C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, &amp; R. Freer, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3567.2, p. 91 (2d ed., Supp. 2005) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller) (characterizing the <i>Finley</i> decision as \"surprising\").</p>\n<p>[2]  See generally 13B Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7\u00a7 3567, 3567.1, 3567.2 (2d ed. 1984) (discussing pendent jurisdiction); 13 <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 3523 (discussing ancillary jurisdiction); Hart &amp; Wechsler 922-926 (discussing pendent jurisdiction); <i>id.,</i> at 1488-1490 (discussing ancillary jurisdiction).</p>\n<p>[3]  Anomalously, in holding that each class member \"must satisfy the jurisdictional amount,\" <i>Zahn</i> v. <i>International Paper Co.,</i> 414 U. S. 291, 301 (1973), the <i>Zahn</i> Court did not refer to <i>Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur</i> v. <i>Cauble,</i> 255 U. S. 356, 366 (1921), which established that in a class action, the citizenship of the named plaintiff is controlling. But see <i>Zahn,</i> 414 U. S., at 309-310 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (urging <i>Zahn</i>'s inconsistency with <i>Ben-Hur</i>).</p>\n<p>[4]  The omnibus Act encompassed the Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990 (Title I), the creation of new judgeships (Title II), the Federal Courts Study Committee Implementation Act of 1990 (Title III), and the establishment of the National Commission on Judicial Discipline and Removal (Title IV).</p>\n<p>[5]  Endeavoring to preserve the \"complete diversity\" rule first stated in <i>Strawbridge</i> v. <i>Curtiss,</i> 3 Cranch 267 (1806), the Court's opinion drives a wedge between the two components of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1332, treating the diversity-of-citizenship requirement as essential, the amount-incontroversy requirement as more readily disposable. See <i>ante,</i> at 553, 562. Section 1332 itself, however, does not rank order the two requirements. What \"[o]rdinary principl[e] of statutory construction\" or \"sound canon of interpretation,\" <i>ante,</i> at 558, allows the Court to slice up \u00a7 1332 this way? In partial explanation, the Court asserts that amount in controversy can be analyzed claim by claim, but the diversity requirement cannot. See <i>ante,</i> at 554. It is not altogether clear why that should be so. The cure for improper joinder of a nondiverse party is the same as the cure for improper joinder of a plaintiff who does not satisfy the jurisdictional amount. In both cases, original jurisdiction can be preserved by dismissing the nonqualifying party. See <i>Caterpillar Inc.</i> v. <i>Lewis,</i> 519 U. S. 61, 64 (1996) (diversity); <i>Newman-Green, Inc.</i> v. <i>Alfonzo-Larrain,</i> 490 U. S. 826, 836-838 (1989) (same); <i>Zahn,</i> 414 U. S., at 295, 300 (amount in controversy); <i>Clark</i> v. <i>Paul Gray, Inc.,</i> 306 U. S. 583, 590 (1939) (same).</p>\n<p>[6]  The Court noted in <i>Zahn,</i> 414 U. S., at 302, n. 11, that when the exercise of \u00a7 1331 federal-question jurisdiction and \u00a7 1332 diversity jurisdiction were conditioned on the same jurisdictional-amount limitation, the same nonaggregation rule applied under both heads of federal jurisdiction. But cf. <i>ante,</i> at 562. The Court added, however, that \"Congress ha[d] exempted major areas of federal-question jurisdiction from any jurisdictional-amount requirements,\" thus diminishing the impact of \u00a7 1331's \"matter in controversy\" specification in cases arising under federal law. <i>Zahn,</i> 414 U. S., at 302, n. 11.</p>\n<p>[7]  Title 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1367(b) provides:\n</p>\n<p>\"In any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332 of this title, the district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19 of such rules, or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 24 of such rules, when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section 1332.\"</p>\n<p>[8]  Under the Court's construction of \u00a7 1367, see <i>ante,</i> at 560, 566-567, Beatriz Ortega's family members can remain in the action because their joinder is merely permissive, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 20. If, however, their presence was \"needed for just adjudication,\" Rule 19, their dismissal would be required. The inclusion of those who may join, and exclusion of those who should or must join, defies rational explanation, but cf. <i>ante,</i> at 565, and others adopting the interpretation the Court embraces have so acknowledged, see <i>Stromberg Metal Works, Inc.</i> v. <i>Press Mechanical, Inc.,</i> 77 F. 3d 928, 932 (CA7 1996) (recognizing the anomaly and inquiring: \"What sense can this make?\"); cf. 14B Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 3704, p. 168 (3d ed. 1998) (distinction between Rule 19 and Rule 20 \"seems incongruous, and serves no apparent public policy purpose\").</p>\n<p>[9]  On this reading of \u00a7 1367(a), it is immaterial that \u00a7 1367(b) \"does not withdraw supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of the additional parties at issue here.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 560. Because those claims would not come within \u00a7 1367(a) in the first place, Congress would have had no reason to list them in \u00a7 1367(b). See <i>infra,</i> at 592-593.</p>\n<p>[10]  The Court's opinion blends the two doctrines, according no significance to their discrete development. See <i>ante,</i> at 552-557.</p>\n<p>[11]  The point of the Court's extended discussion of <i>Chicago</i> v. <i>International College of Surgeons,</i> 522 U. S. 156 (1997), in the instant cases, see <i>ante,</i> at 562-564, slips from my grasp. There was no disagreement in that case, and there is none now, that 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1367(a) is properly read to authorize the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction in removed cases. <i>International College of Surgeons</i> was unusual in that the federal court there was asked to review a decision of a local administrative agency. Such review, it was unsuccessfully argued, was \"appellate\" in character, and therefore outside the ken of a court empowered to exercise \"original\" jurisdiction. Compare 522 U. S., at 166-168, with <i>id.,</i> at 176-177 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>[12]  The Court notes the passage this year of the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA), Pub. L. 109-2, 119 Stat. 4, <i>ante,</i> at 571-572, only to dismiss that legislation as irrelevant. Subject to several exceptions and qualifications, CAFA provides for federal-court adjudication of state-law-based class actions in which diversity is \"minimal\" (one plaintiff's diversity from one defendant suffices), and the \"matter in controversy\" is an aggregate amount in excess of $5,000,000. Significant here, CAFA's enlargement of federal-court diversity jurisdiction was accomplished, \"clearly and conspicuously,\" by amending \u00a7 1332. Cf. <i>Rosario Ortega</i> v. <i>Star-Kist Foods, Inc.,</i> 370 F. 3d 124, 142 (CA1 2004).</p>\n<p>[13]  If \u00a7 1367(a) itself renders unnecessary the listing of Rule 20 plaintiffs and Rule 23 class actions in \u00a7 1367(b), see <i>supra,</i> at 592, then it is similarly unnecessary to refer, as \u00a7 1367(b) does, to \"persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19.\" On one account, Congress bracketed such persons with persons \"seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 24\" to modify pre-\u00a7 1367 practice. Before enactment of \u00a7 1367, courts entertained, under the heading ancillary jurisdiction, claims of Rule 24(a) intervenors \"of right,\" see <i>Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co.</i> v. <i>Kroger,</i> 437 U. S. 365, 375, n. 18 (1978), but denied ancillary jurisdiction over claims of \"necessary\" Rule 19 plaintiffs, see 13 Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 3523, p. 127 (2d ed., Supp. 2005). Congress may have sought simply to underscore that those seeking to join as plaintiffs, whether under Rule 19 or Rule 24, should be treated alike, <i>i. e.,</i> denied joinder when \"inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section 1332.\" See 370 F. 3d, at 140, and n. 15 (internal quotation marks omitted); H. R. Rep., at 29 (\"Subsection (b) makes one small change in pre-<i>Finley</i> practice,\" <i>i. e.,</i> it eliminates the Rule 19/Rule 24 anomaly.).</p>\n<p>[14]  While the interpretation of \u00a7 1367 described in this opinion does not rely on the measure's legislative history, that history, as JUSTICE STEVENS has shown, see <i>ante,</i> at 573 (dissenting opinion), is corroborative of the statutory reading set out above.</p>\n\n</div>",

Argued March 1, 2005\u2014Decided June 23, 2005*\nIn No. 04\u201370, Exxon dealers filed a class action against Exxon Corpora-\n  tion, invoking the Federal District Court\u2019s 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332(a) diver-\n  sity jurisdiction. After the dealers won a jury verdict, the court certi-\n  fied the case for interlocutory review on the question whether it had\n  properly exercised \u00a71367 supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of\n  class members who had not met \u00a71332(a)\u2019s minimum amount-in-\n  controversy requirement. The Eleventh Circuit upheld this extension\n  of supplemental jurisdiction. In No. 04\u201379, a girl and her family\n  sought damages from Star-Kist Foods, Inc., in a diversity action. The\n  District Court granted Star-Kist summary judgment, finding that\n  none of the plaintiffs had met the amount-in-controversy require-\n  ment. The First Circuit ruled that the girl, but not her family, had\n  alleged the requisite amount, and then held that supplemental juris-\n  diction over the family\u2019s claims was improper because original juris-\n  diction is lacking in a diversity case if one plaintiff fails to satisfy the\n  amount-in-controversy requirement.\nHeld: Where the other elements of jurisdiction are present and at least\n one named plaintiff in the action satisfies \u00a71332(a)\u2019s amount-in-\n controversy requirement, \u00a71367 authorizes supplemental jurisdiction\n over the claims of other plaintiffs in the same Article III case or con-\n troversy, even if those claims are for less than the requisite amount.\n Pp. 4\u201325.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 04\u201379, del Rosario Ortega et al. v.

ALLAPATTAH SERVICES, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       (a) Although district courts may not exercise jurisdiction absent a\n    statutory basis, once a court has original jurisdiction over some\n    claims in an action, it may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over\n    additional claims arising from the same case or controversy. See\n    Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U. S. 715. This expansive interpretation\n    does not apply to \u00a71332\u2019s complete diversity requirement, for incom-\n    plete diversity destroys original jurisdiction with respect to all\n    claims, leaving nothing to which supplemental claims can adhere.\n    But other statutory prerequisites, including the federal-question and\n    amount-in-controversy requirements, can be analyzed claim by claim.\n    Before \u00a71367 was enacted, every plaintiff had to separately satisfy\n    the amount-in-controversy requirement, Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., 306\n    U. S. 583; Zahn v. International Paper Co., 414 U. S. 291, and the\n    grant of original jurisdiction over claims involving particular parties\n    did not itself confer supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims\n    involving other parties, Finley v. United States, 490 U. S. 545, 556.\n    Pp. 4\u20139.\n       (b) All parties here agree that \u00a71367 overturned Finley, but there is\n    no warrant for assuming that is all it did. To determine \u00a71367\u2019s\n    scope requires examination of the statute\u2019s text in light of context,\n    structure, and related statutory provisions. Section 1367(a) is a\n    broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction over other claims within the\n    same case or controversy, as long as the action is one in which dis-\n    trict courts would have original jurisdiction. Its last sentence makes\n    clear that this grant extends to claims involving joinder or interven-\n    tion of additional parties. The question here is whether a diversity\n    case in which the claims of some, but not all, plaintiffs satisfy the\n    amount-in-controversy requirement qualifies as a \u201ccivil action of\n    which the district courts have original jurisdiction,\u201d \u00a71367(a). Pp. 9\u2013\n    11.\n       (c) The answer must be yes. When a well-pleaded complaint has at\n    least one claim satisfying the amount-in-controversy requirement,\n    and there are no other relevant jurisdictional defects, the district\n    court, beyond all question, has original jurisdiction over that claim.\n    A court with original jurisdiction over a single claim in the complaint\n    has original jurisdiction over a \u201ccivil action\u201d under \u00a71367(a), even if\n    that action comprises fewer claims than were included in the com-\n    plaint. Once a court has original jurisdiction over the action, it can\n    then decide whether it has a constitutional and statutory basis for\n    exercising supplemental jurisdiction over other claims in the action.\n    Section 1367(b), which contains exceptions to \u00a71367(a)\u2019s broad rule,\n    does not withdraw supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of the\n    additional parties here. In fact, its exceptions support this Court\u2019s\n    conclusion. Pp. 11\u201313.\n                     Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n     (d) The Court cannot accept the alternative view, or its supporting\n  theories, that a district court lacks original jurisdiction over a civil\n  action unless it has original jurisdiction over every claim in the com-\n  plaint. The \u201cindivisibility theory\u201d\u2014that all claims must stand or fall\n  as a single, indivisible action\u2014is inconsistent with the whole notion\n  of supplemental jurisdiction and is belied by this Court\u2019s practice of\n  allowing federal courts to cure jurisdictional defects by dismissing the\n  offending parties instead of the entire action. And the statute\u2019s broad\n  and general language does not permit the theory to apply in diversity\n  cases when it does not apply in federal-question cases. The \u201ccon-\n  tamination theory\u201d\u2014that inclusion of a claim or party falling outside\n  the district court\u2019s original jurisdiction contaminates every other\n  claim in the complaint\u2014makes sense with respect to the complete di-\n  versity requirement because a nondiverse party\u2019s presence eliminates\n  the justification for a federal forum. But it makes little sense with\n  regard to the amount-in-controversy requirement, which is meant to\n  ensure that a dispute is sufficiently important to warrant federal-\n  court attention. It is fallacious to suppose, simply from the proposi-\n  tion that \u00a71332 imposes both requirements, that the contamination\n  theory germane to the former also applies to the latter. This Court\n  has already considered and rejected a virtually identical argument in\n  the closely analogous removal-jurisdiction context. See Chicago v. In-\n  ternational College of Surgeons, 522 U. S. 156. Pp. 13\u201319.\n     (e) In light of the statute\u2019s text and structure, \u00a71367\u2019s only plausi-\n  ble reading is that a court has original jurisdiction over a civil action\n  comprising the claims for which there is no jurisdictional defect.\n  Though a single nondiverse party can contaminate every other claim\n  in a lawsuit, contamination does not occur with respect to jurisdic-\n  tional defects going only to the substantive importance of individual\n  claims. Thus, \u00a71367(a)\u2019s threshold requirement is satisfied in cases,\n  such as these, where some but not all of the plaintiffs in a diversity\n  action allege a sufficient amount in controversy. Section 1367 by its\n  plain text overruled Clark and Zahn and authorized supplemental\n  jurisdiction over all claims by diverse parties arising out of the same\n  case or controversy, subject only to enumerated exceptions not appli-\n  cable here. P. 19.\n     (f) Because \u00a71367 is not ambiguous, this Court need not examine\n  other interpretative tools, including legislative history. Even were it\n  appropriate to do so, the Court would not give the legislative history\n  significant weight.

S. ___ (2004).\n   We hold that, where the other elements of jurisdiction\nare present and at least one named plaintiff in the action\nsatisfies the amount-in-controversy requirement, \u00a71367\ndoes authorize supplemental jurisdiction over the claims\n2    EXXON MOBIL CORP. v. ALLAPATTAH SERVICES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof other plaintiffs in the same Article III case or contro-\nversy, even if those claims are for less than the jurisdic-\ntional amount specified in the statute setting forth the\nrequirements for diversity jurisdiction. We affirm the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\nin No. 04\u201370, and we reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the First Circuit in No. 04\u201379.\n                               I\n   In 1991, about 10,000 Exxon dealers filed a class-action\nsuit against the Exxon Corporation in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Florida. The\ndealers alleged an intentional and systematic scheme by\nExxon under which they were overcharged for fuel pur-\nchased from Exxon. The plaintiffs invoked the District\nCourt\u2019s \u00a71332(a) diversity jurisdiction. After a unanimous\njury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, the District Court\ncertified the case for interlocutory review, asking whether\nit had properly exercised \u00a71367 supplemental jurisdiction\nover the claims of class members who did not meet the\njurisdictional minimum amount in controversy.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld\nthe District Court\u2019s extension of supplemental jurisdiction\nto these class members. Allapattah Services, Inc. v. Exxon\nCorp., 333 F. 3d 1248 (2003). \u201c[W]e find,\u201d the court held,\n\u201cthat \u00a71367 clearly and unambiguously provides district\ncourts with the authority in diversity class actions to\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of class\nmembers who do not meet the minimum amount in con-\ntroversy as long as the district court has original jurisdic-\ntion over the claims of at least one of the class representa-\ntives.\u201d Id., at 1256. This decision accords with the views\nof the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Sixth, and Sev-\nenth Circuits. See Rosmer v. Pfizer, Inc., 263 F. 3d 110\n(CA4 2001); Olden v.

These decisions,\nhowever, are unclear on whether all the named plaintiffs\nmust satisfy this requirement. In re Abbott Labs., 51 F. 3d\n524 (CA5 1995); Gibson v. Chrysler Corp., 261 F. 3d 927\n(CA9 2001).\n   In the other case now before us the Court of Appeals for\nthe First Circuit took a different position on the meaning\nof \u00a71367(a). 370 F. 3d 124 (2004). In that case, a 9-year-\nold girl sued Star-Kist in a diversity action in the United\nStates District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, seek-\ning damages for unusually severe injuries she received\nwhen she sliced her finger on a tuna can. Her family\njoined in the suit, seeking damages for emotional distress\nand certain medical expenses. The District Court granted\nsummary judgment to Star-Kist, finding that none of the\nplaintiffs met the minimum amount-in-controversy re-\nquirement. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit,\nhowever, ruled that the injured girl, but not her family\nmembers, had made allegations of damages in the requi-\nsite amount.\n   The Court of Appeals then addressed whether, in light\nof the fact that one plaintiff met the requirements for\noriginal jurisdiction, supplemental jurisdiction over the\nremaining plaintiffs\u2019 claims was proper under \u00a71367. The\ncourt held that \u00a71367 authorizes supplemental jurisdiction\nonly when the district court has original jurisdiction over\nthe action, and that in a diversity case original jurisdiction\nis lacking if one plaintiff fails to satisfy the amount-in-\ncontroversy requirement. Although the Court of Appeals\nclaimed to \u201cexpress no view\u201d on whether the result would\n4    EXXON MOBIL CORP. v. ALLAPATTAH SERVICES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbe the same in a class action, id., at 143, n. 19, its analysis\nis inconsistent with that of the Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit. The Court of Appeals for the First\nCircuit\u2019s view of \u00a71367 is, however, shared by the Courts\nof Appeal for the Third, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits, and\nthe latter two Courts of Appeals have expressly applied\nthis rule to class actions. See Meritcare, Inc. v. St. Paul\nMercury Ins. Co., 166 F. 3d 214 (CA3 1999); Trimble v.\nAsarco, Inc., 232 F. 3d 946 (CA8 2000); Leonhardt v. West-\nern Sugar Co., 160 F. 3d 631 (CA10 1998).\n                              II\n                               A\n   The district courts of the United States, as we have said\nmany times, are \u201ccourts of limited jurisdiction. They\npossess only that power authorized by Constitution and\nstatute,\u201d Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America,\n511 U. S. 375, 377 (1994). In order to provide a federal\nforum for plaintiffs who seek to vindicate federal rights,\nCongress has conferred on the district courts original\njurisdiction in federal-question cases\u2014civil actions that\narise under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the\nUnited States. 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331. In order to provide a\nneutral forum for what have come to be known as diver-\nsity cases, Congress also has granted district courts origi-\nnal jurisdiction in civil actions between citizens of differ-\nent States, between U. S. citizens and foreign citizens, or\nby foreign states against U. S. citizens. \u00a71332. To ensure\nthat diversity jurisdiction does not flood the federal courts\nwith minor disputes, \u00a71332(a) requires that the matter in\ncontroversy in a diversity case exceed a specified amount,\ncurrently $75,000. \u00a71332(a).\n   Although the district courts may not exercise jurisdic-\ntion absent a statutory basis, it is well established\u2014in\ncertain classes of cases\u2014that, once a court has original\njurisdiction over some claims in the action, it may exercise\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over additional claims that are\npart of the same case or controversy. The leading modern\ncase for this principle is Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U. S.\n715 (1966). In Gibbs, the plaintiff alleged the defendant\u2019s\nconduct violated both federal and state law. The District\nCourt, Gibbs held, had original jurisdiction over the action\nbased on the federal claims. Gibbs confirmed that the\nDistrict Court had the additional power (though not the\nobligation) to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over\nrelated state claims that arose from the same Article III\ncase or controversy. Id., at 725 (\u201cThe federal claim must\nhave substance sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdic-\ntion on the court. . . . [A]ssuming substantiality of the\nfederal issues, there is power in federal courts to hear the\nwhole\u201d).\n   As we later noted, the decision allowing jurisdiction over\npendent state claims in Gibbs did not mention, let alone\ncome to grips with, the text of the jurisdictional statutes\nand the bedrock principle that federal courts have no\njurisdiction without statutory authorization. Finley v.\nUnited States, 490 U. S. 545, 548 (1989). In Finley, we\nnonetheless reaffirmed and rationalized Gibbs and its\nprogeny by inferring from it the interpretive principle\nthat, in cases involving supplemental jurisdiction over\nadditional claims between parties properly in federal\ncourt, the jurisdictional statutes should be read broadly,\non the assumption that in this context Congress intended\nto authorize courts to exercise their full Article III power\nto dispose of an \u201c \u2018entire action before the court [which]\ncomprises but one constitutional \u201ccase.\u201d\u2019 \u201d 490 U. S., at\n549 (quoting Gibbs, supra, at 725).\n   We have not, however, applied Gibbs\u2019 expansive inter-\npretive approach to other aspects of the jurisdictional\nstatutes. For instance, we have consistently interpreted\n\u00a71332 as requiring complete diversity: In a case with\nmultiple plaintiffs and multiple defendants, the presence\n6    EXXON MOBIL CORP. v. ALLAPATTAH SERVICES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin the action of a single plaintiff from the same State as a\nsingle defendant deprives the district court of original\ndiversity jurisdiction over the entire action. Strawbridge\nv. Curtiss, 3 Cranch 267 (1806); Owen Equipment & Erec-\ntion Co. v. Kroger, 437 U. S. 365, 375 (1978). The complete\ndiversity requirement is not mandated by the Constitu-\ntion, State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Tashire, 386 U. S.\n523, 530\u2013531 (1967), or by the plain text of \u00a71332(a). The\nCourt, nonetheless, has adhered to the complete diversity\nrule in light of the purpose of the diversity requirement,\nwhich is to provide a federal forum for important disputes\nwhere state courts might favor, or be perceived as favor-\ning, home-state litigants. The presence of parties from the\nsame State on both sides of a case dispels this concern,\neliminating a principal reason for conferring \u00a71332 juris-\ndiction over any of the claims in the action. See Wisconsin\nDept. of Corrections v. Schacht, 524 U. S. 381, 389 (1998);\nNewman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain, 490 U. S. 826, 829\n(1989). The specific purpose of the complete diversity rule\nexplains both why we have not adopted Gibbs\u2019 expansive\ninterpretive approach to this aspect of the jurisdictional\nstatute and why Gibbs does not undermine the complete\ndiversity rule. In order for a federal court to invoke sup-\nplemental jurisdiction under Gibbs, it must first have\noriginal jurisdiction over at least one claim in the action.\nIncomplete diversity destroys original jurisdiction with\nrespect to all claims, so there is nothing to which supple-\nmental jurisdiction can adhere.\n   In contrast to the diversity requirement, most of the\nother statutory prerequisites for federal jurisdiction,\nincluding the federal-question and amount-in-controversy\nrequirements, can be analyzed claim by claim. True, it\ndoes not follow by necessity from this that a district court\nhas authority to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over\nall claims provided there is original jurisdiction over just\none. Before the enactment of \u00a71367, the Court declined in\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncontexts other than the pendent-claim instance to follow\nGibbs\u2019 expansive approach to interpretation of the juris-\ndictional statutes. The Court took a more restrictive view\nof the proper interpretation of these statutes in so-called\npendent-party cases involving supplemental jurisdiction\nover claims involving additional parties\u2014plaintiffs or\ndefendants\u2014where the district courts would lack original\njurisdiction over claims by each of the parties standing\nalone.\n   Thus, with respect to plaintiff-specific jurisdictional\nrequirements, the Court held in Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc.,\n306 U. S. 583 (1939), that every plaintiff must separately\nsatisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement. Though\nClark was a federal-question case, at that time federal-\nquestion jurisdiction had an amount-in-controversy re-\nquirement analogous to the amount-in-controversy re-\nquirement for diversity cases. \u201cProper practice,\u201d Clark\nheld, \u201crequires that where each of several plaintiffs is\nbound to establish the jurisdictional amount with respect\nto his own claim, the suit should be dismissed as to those\nwho fail to show that the requisite amount is involved.\u201d\nId., at 590. The Court reaffirmed this rule, in the context\nof a class action brought invoking \u00a71332(a) diversity juris-\ndiction, in Zahn v. International Paper Co., 414 U. S. 291\n(1973). It follows \u201cinescapably\u201d from Clark, the Court held\nin Zahn, that \u201cany plaintiff without the jurisdictional\namount must be dismissed from the case, even though\nothers allege jurisdictionally sufficient claims.\u201d 414 U. S.,\nat 300.\n   The Court took a similar approach with respect to sup-\nplemental jurisdiction over claims against additional\ndefendants that fall outside the district courts\u2019 original\njurisdiction. In Aldinger v. Howard, 427 U. S. 1 (1976),\nthe plaintiff brought a 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 action against\ncounty officials in district court pursuant to the statutory\ngrant of jurisdiction in 28 U. S. C. \u00a71343(3) (1976 ed.).\n8    EXXON MOBIL CORP. v. ALLAPATTAH SERVICES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe plaintiff further alleged the court had supplemental\njurisdiction over her related state-law claims against the\ncounty, even though the county was not suable under\n\u00a71983 and so was not subject to \u00a71343(3)\u2019s original juris-\ndiction. The Court held that supplemental jurisdiction\ncould not be exercised because Congress, in enacting\n\u00a71343(3), had declined (albeit implicitly) to extend federal\njurisdiction over any party who could not be sued under\nthe federal civil rights statutes. 427 U. S., at 16\u201319.\n\u201cBefore it can be concluded that [supplemental] jurisdic-\ntion [over additional parties] exists,\u201d Aldinger held, \u201ca\nfederal court must satisfy itself not only that Art[icle] III\npermits it, but that Congress in the statutes conferring\njurisdiction has not expressly or by implication negated its\nexistence.\u201d Id., at 18.\n   In Finley v. United States, 490 U. S. 545 (1989), we\nconfronted a similar issue in a different statutory context.\nThe plaintiff in Finley brought a Federal Tort Claims Act\nnegligence suit against the Federal Aviation Administra-\ntion in District Court, which had original jurisdiction\nunder \u00a71346(b). The plaintiff tried to add related claims\nagainst other defendants, invoking the District Court\u2019s\nsupplemental jurisdiction over so-called pendent parties.\nWe held that the District Court lacked a sufficient statu-\ntory basis for exercising supplemental jurisdiction over\nthese claims. Relying primarily on Zahn, Aldinger, and\nKroger, we held in Finley that \u201ca grant of jurisdiction over\nclaims involving particular parties does not itself confer\njurisdiction over additional claims by or against different\nparties.\u201d 490 U. S., at 556. While Finley did not \u201climit or\nimpair\u201d Gibbs\u2019 liberal approach to interpreting the juris-\ndictional statutes in the context of supplemental jurisdic-\ntion over additional claims involving the same parties, 490\nU. S., at 556, Finley nevertheless declined to extend that\ninterpretive assumption to claims involving additional\nparties. Finley held that in the context of parties, in con-\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntrast to claims, \u201cwe will not assume that the full constitu-\ntional power has been congressionally authorized, and will\nnot read jurisdictional statutes broadly.\u201d Id., at 549.\n   As the jurisdictional statutes existed in 1989, then, here\nis how matters stood: First, the diversity requirement in\n\u00a71332(a) required complete diversity; absent complete\ndiversity, the district court lacked original jurisdiction\nover all of the claims in the action. Strawbridge, 3\nCranch, at 267\u2013268; Kroger, 437 U. S., at 373\u2013374. Sec-\nond, if the district court had original jurisdiction over at\nleast one claim, the jurisdictional statutes implicitly au-\nthorized supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims\nbetween the same parties arising out of the same Article\nIII case or controversy. Gibbs, 383 U. S., at 725. Third,\neven when the district court had original jurisdiction over\none or more claims between particular parties, the juris-\ndictional statutes did not authorize supplemental jurisdic-\ntion over additional claims involving other parties. Clark,\nsupra, at 590; Zahn, supra, at 300\u2013301; Finley, supra, at\n556.\n                             B\n  In Finley we emphasized that \u201c[w]hatever we say re-\ngarding the scope of jurisdiction conferred by a particular\nstatute can of course be changed by Congress.\u201d 490 U. S.,\nat 556. In 1990, Congress accepted the invitation. It\npassed the Judicial Improvements Act, 104 Stat. 5089,\nwhich enacted \u00a71367, the provision which controls these\ncases.\n  Section 1367 provides, in relevant part:\n    \u201c(a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as\n    expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute, in\n    any civil action of which the district courts have origi-\n    nal jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supple-\n    mental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so\n    related to claims in the action within such original ju-\n10   EXXON MOBIL CORP. v. ALLAPATTAH SERVICES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n     risdiction that they form part of the same case or con-\n     troversy under Article III of the United States Consti-\n     tution. Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include\n     claims that involve the joinder or intervention of addi-\n     tional parties.\n     \u201c(b) In any civil action of which the district courts\n     have original jurisdiction founded solely on section\n     1332 of this title, the district courts shall not have\n     supplemental jurisdiction under subsection (a) over\n     claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties un-\n     der Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil\n     Procedure, or over claims by persons proposed to be\n     joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19 of such rules, or\n     seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 24 of\n     such rules, when exercising supplemental jurisdiction\n     over such claims would be inconsistent with the juris-\n     dictional requirements of section 1332.\u201d\n  All parties to this litigation and all courts to consider\nthe question agree that \u00a71367 overturned the result in\nFinley. There is no warrant, however, for assuming that\n\u00a71367 did no more than to overrule Finley and otherwise\nto codify the existing state of the law of supplemental\njurisdiction. We must not give jurisdictional statutes a\nmore expansive interpretation than their text warrants,\n490 U. S., at 549, 556; but it is just as important not to\nadopt an artificial construction that is narrower than what\nthe text provides. No sound canon of interpretation re-\nquires Congress to speak with extraordinary clarity in\norder to modify the rules of federal jurisdiction within\nappropriate constitutional bounds. Ordinary principles of\nstatutory construction apply. In order to determine the\nscope of supplemental jurisdiction authorized by \u00a71367,\nthen, we must examine the statute\u2019s text in light of con-\ntext, structure, and related statutory provisions.\n  Section 1367(a) is a broad grant of supplemental juris-\n                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndiction over other claims within the same case or contro-\nversy, as long as the action is one in which the district\ncourts would have original jurisdiction. The last sentence\nof \u00a71367(a) makes it clear that the grant of supplemental\njurisdiction extends to claims involving joinder or inter-\nvention of additional parties. The single question before\nus, therefore, is whether a diversity case in which the\nclaims of some plaintiffs satisfy the amount-in-controversy\nrequirement, but the claims of others plaintiffs do not,\npresents a \u201ccivil action of which the district courts have\noriginal jurisdiction.\u201d If the answer is yes, \u00a71367(a) con-\nfers supplemental jurisdiction over all claims, including\nthose that do not independently satisfy the amount-in-\ncontroversy requirement, if the claims are part of the\nsame Article III case or controversy. If the answer is no,\n\u00a71367(a) is inapplicable and, in light of our holdings in\nClark and Zahn, the district court has no statutory basis\nfor exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the addi-\ntional claims.\n   We now conclude the answer must be yes. When the\nwell-pleaded complaint contains at least one claim that\nsatisfies the amount-in-controversy requirement, and\nthere are no other relevant jurisdictional defects, the\ndistrict court, beyond all question, has original jurisdiction\nover that claim. The presence of other claims in the com-\nplaint, over which the district court may lack original\njurisdiction, is of no moment. If the court has original\njurisdiction over a single claim in the complaint, it has\noriginal jurisdiction over a \u201ccivil action\u201d within the mean-\ning of \u00a71367(a), even if the civil action over which it has\njurisdiction comprises fewer claims than were included in\nthe complaint. Once the court determines it has original\njurisdiction over the civil action, it can turn to the ques-\ntion whether it has a constitutional and statutory basis for\nexercising supplemental jurisdiction over the other claims\nin the action.\n12   EXXON MOBIL CORP. v. ALLAPATTAH SERVICES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Section 1367(a) commences with the direction that\n\u00a7\u00a71367(b) and (c), or other relevant statutes, may provide\nspecific exceptions, but otherwise \u00a71367(a) is a broad\njurisdictional grant, with no distinction drawn between\npendent-claim and pendent-party cases. In fact, the last\nsentence of \u00a71367(a) makes clear that the provision grants\nsupplemental jurisdiction over claims involving joinder or\nintervention of additional parties. The terms of \u00a71367 do\nnot acknowledge any distinction between pendent jurisdic-\ntion and the doctrine of so-called ancillary jurisdiction.\nThough the doctrines of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction\ndeveloped separately as a historical matter, the Court has\nrecognized that the doctrines are \u201ctwo species of the same\ngeneric problem,\u201d Kroger, 437 U. S., at 370. Nothing in\n\u00a71367 indicates a congressional intent to recognize, pre-\nserve, or create some meaningful, substantive distinction\nbetween the jurisdictional categories we have historically\nlabeled pendent and ancillary.\n   If \u00a71367(a) were the sum total of the relevant statutory\nlanguage, our holding would rest on that language alone.\nThe statute, of course, instructs us to examine \u00a71367(b) to\ndetermine if any of its exceptions apply, so we proceed to\nthat section. While \u00a71367(b) qualifies the broad rule of\n\u00a71367(a), it does not withdraw supplemental jurisdiction\nover the claims of the additional parties at issue here. The\nspecific exceptions to \u00a71367(a) contained in \u00a71367(b),\nmoreover, provide additional support for our conclusion\nthat \u00a71367(a) confers supplemental jurisdiction over these\nclaims. Section 1367(b), which applies only to diversity\ncases, withholds supplemental jurisdiction over the claims\nof plaintiffs proposed to be joined as indispensable parties\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19, or who seek to\nintervene pursuant to Rule 24. Nothing in the text of\n\u00a71367(b), however, withholds supplemental jurisdiction\nover the claims of plaintiffs permissively joined under\nRule 20 (like the additional plaintiffs in No. 04\u201379) or\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncertified as class-action members pursuant to Rule 23 (like\nthe additional plaintiffs in No. 04\u201370). The natural, in-\ndeed the necessary, inference is that \u00a71367 confers sup-\nplemental jurisdiction over claims by Rule 20 and Rule 23\nplaintiffs. This inference, at least with respect to Rule 20\nplaintiffs, is strengthened by the fact that \u00a71367(b) explic-\nitly excludes supplemental jurisdiction over claims against\ndefendants joined under Rule 20.\n   We cannot accept the view, urged by some of the parties,\ncommentators, and Courts of Appeals, that a district court\nlacks original jurisdiction over a civil action unless the\ncourt has original jurisdiction over every claim in the\ncomplaint. As we understand this position, it requires\nassuming either that all claims in the complaint must\nstand or fall as a single, indivisible \u201ccivil action\u201d as a\nmatter of definitional necessity\u2014what we will refer to as\nthe \u201cindivisibility theory\u201d\u2014or else that the inclusion of a\nclaim or party falling outside the district court\u2019s original\njurisdiction somehow contaminates every other claim in\nthe complaint, depriving the court of original jurisdiction\nover any of these claims\u2014what we will refer to as the\n\u201ccontamination theory.\u201d\n   The indivisibility theory is easily dismissed, as it is\ninconsistent with the whole notion of supplemental juris-\ndiction. If a district court must have original jurisdiction\nover every claim in the complaint in order to have \u201corigi-\nnal jurisdiction\u201d over a \u201ccivil action,\u201d then in Gibbs there\nwas no civil action of which the district court could assume\noriginal jurisdiction under \u00a71331, and so no basis for\nexercising supplemental jurisdiction over any of the\nclaims. The indivisibility theory is further belied by our\npractice\u2014in both federal-question and diversity cases\u2014of\nallowing federal courts to cure jurisdictional defects by\ndismissing the offending parties rather than dismissing\nthe entire action. Clark, for example, makes clear that\nclaims that are jurisdictionally defective as to amount in\n14   EXXON MOBIL CORP. v. ALLAPATTAH SERVICES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncontroversy do not destroy original jurisdiction over other\nclaims. 306 U. S., at 590 (dismissing parties who failed to\nmeet the amount-in-controversy requirement but retain-\ning jurisdiction over the remaining party). If the presence\nof jurisdictionally problematic claims in the complaint\nmeant the district court was without original jurisdiction\nover the single, indivisible civil action before it, then the\ndistrict court would have to dismiss the whole action\nrather than particular parties.\n   We also find it unconvincing to say that the definitional\nindivisibility theory applies in the context of diversity\ncases but not in the context of federal-question cases. The\nbroad and general language of the statute does not permit\nthis result. The contention is premised on the notion that\nthe phrase \u201coriginal jurisdiction of all civil actions\u201d means\ndifferent things in \u00a71331 and \u00a71332. It is implausible,\nhowever, to say that the identical phrase means one thing\n(original jurisdiction in all actions where at least one claim\nin the complaint meets the following requirements) in\n\u00a71331 and something else (original jurisdiction in all\nactions where every claim in the complaint meets the\nfollowing requirements) in \u00a71332.\n   The contamination theory, as we have noted, can make\nsome sense in the special context of the complete diversity\nrequirement because the presence of nondiverse parties on\nboth sides of a lawsuit eliminates the justification for\nproviding a federal forum. The theory, however, makes\nlittle sense with respect to the amount-in-controversy\nrequirement, which is meant to ensure that a dispute is\nsufficiently important to warrant federal-court attention.\nThe presence of a single nondiverse party may eliminate\nthe fear of bias with respect to all claims, but the presence\nof a claim that falls short of the minimum amount in\ncontroversy does nothing to reduce the importance of the\nclaims that do meet this requirement.\n   It is fallacious to suppose, simply from the proposition\n                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat \u00a71332 imposes both the diversity requirement and the\namount-in-controversy requirement, that the contamina-\ntion theory germane to the former is also relevant to the\nlatter. There is no inherent logical connection between the\namount-in-controversy requirement and \u00a71332 diversity\njurisdiction. After all, federal-question jurisdiction once\nhad an amount-in-controversy requirement as well. If\nsuch a requirement were revived under \u00a71331, it is clear\nbeyond peradventure that \u00a71367(a) provides supplemental\njurisdiction over federal-question cases where some, but\nnot all, of the federal-law claims involve a sufficient\namount in controversy. In other words, \u00a71367(a) unambi-\nguously overrules the holding and the result in Clark. If\nthat is so, however, it would be quite extraordinary to say\nthat \u00a71367 did not also overrule Zahn, a case that was\npremised in substantial part on the holding in Clark.\n   In addition to the theoretical difficulties with the argu-\nment that a district court has original jurisdiction over a\ncivil action only if it has original jurisdiction over each\nindividual claim in the complaint, we have already consid-\nered and rejected a virtually identical argument in the\nclosely analogous context of removal jurisdiction. In Chi-\ncago v. International College of Surgeons, 522 U. S. 156\n(1997), the plaintiff brought federal- and state-law claims\nin state court. The defendant removed to federal court.\nThe plaintiff objected to removal, citing the text of the\nremoval statute, \u00a71441(a).        That statutory provision,\nwhich bears a striking similarity to the relevant portion of\n\u00a71367, authorizes removal of \u201cany civil action . . . of which\nthe district courts of the United States have original juris-\ndiction . . . .\u201d The College of Surgeons plaintiff urged that,\nbecause its state-law claims were not within the District\nCourt\u2019s original jurisdiction, \u00a71441(a) did not authorize\nremoval. We disagreed. The federal law claims, we held,\n\u201csuffice to make the actions \u2018civil actions\u2019 within the \u2018origi-\nnal jurisdiction\u2019 of the district courts . . . . Nothing in the\n16   EXXON MOBIL CORP. v. ALLAPATTAH SERVICES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\njurisdictional statutes suggests that the presence of re-\nlated state law claims somehow alters the fact that [the\nplaintiff\u2019s] complaints, by virtue of their federal claims,\nwere \u2018civil actions\u2019 within the federal courts\u2019 \u2018original\njurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 166. Once the case was removed, the\nDistrict Court had original jurisdiction over the federal\nlaw claims and supplemental jurisdiction under \u00a71367(a)\nover the state-law claims. Id., at 165.\n   The dissent in College of Surgeons argued that because\nthe plaintiff sought on-the-record review of a local admin-\nistrative agency decision, the review it sought was outside\nthe scope of the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction. Id., at 177\n(opinion of GINSBURG, J.). We rejected both the suggestion\nthat state-law claims involving administrative appeals are\nbeyond the scope of \u00a71367 supplemental jurisdiction, id.,\nat 168\u2013172 (opinion of the Court), and the claim that the\nadministrative review posture of the case deprived the\nDistrict Court of original jurisdiction over the federal-law\nclaims in the case, id., at 163\u2013168. More importantly for\npresent purposes, College of Surgeons stressed that a\ndistrict court has original jurisdiction of a civil action for\npurposes of \u00a71441(a) as long as it has original jurisdiction\nover a subset of the claims constituting the action. Even\nthe College of Surgeons dissent, which took issue with the\nCourt\u2019s interpretation of \u00a71367, did not appear to contest\nthis view of \u00a71441(a).\n   Although College of Surgeons involved additional claims\nbetween the same parties, its interpretation of \u00a71441(a)\napplies equally to cases involving additional parties whose\nclaims fall short of the jurisdictional amount. If we were\nto adopt the contrary view that the presence of additional\nparties means there is no \u201ccivil action . . . of which the\ndistrict courts . . . have original jurisdiction,\u201d those cases\nsimply would not be removable. To our knowledge, no\ncourt has issued a reasoned opinion adopting this view of\nthe removal statute. It is settled, of course, that absent\n                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncomplete diversity a case is not removable because the\ndistrict court would lack original jurisdiction. Caterpillar\nInc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, 73 (1996). This, however, is\naltogether consistent with our view of \u00a71441(a). A failure\nof complete diversity, unlike the failure of some claims to\nmeet the requisite amount in controversy, contaminates\nevery claim in the action.\n   We also reject the argument, similar to the attempted\ndistinction of College of Surgeons discussed above, that\nwhile the presence of additional claims over which the\ndistrict court lacks jurisdiction does not mean the civil\naction is outside the purview of \u00a71367(a), the presence of\nadditional parties does. The basis for this distinction is\nnot altogether clear, and it is in considerable tension with\nstatutory text. Section 1367(a) applies by its terms to any\ncivil action of which the district courts have original juris-\ndiction, and the last sentence of \u00a71367(a) expressly con-\ntemplates that the court may have supplemental jurisdic-\ntion over additional parties. So it cannot be the case that\nthe presence of those parties destroys the court\u2019s original\njurisdiction, within the meaning of \u00a71367(a), over a civil\naction otherwise properly before it. Also, \u00a71367(b) ex-\npressly withholds supplemental jurisdiction in diversity\ncases over claims by plaintiffs joined as indispensable\nparties under Rule 19. If joinder of such parties were\nsufficient to deprive the district court of original jurisdic-\ntion over the civil action within the meaning of \u00a71367(a),\nthis specific limitation on supplemental jurisdiction in\n\u00a71367(b) would be superfluous. The argument that the\npresence of additional parties removes the civil action\nfrom the scope of \u00a71367(a) also would mean that \u00a71367 left\nthe Finley result undisturbed. Finley, after all, involved a\nFederal Tort Claims Act suit against a federal defendant\nand state-law claims against additional defendants not\notherwise subject to federal jurisdiction. Yet all concede\nthat one purpose of \u00a71367 was to change the result\n18   EXXON MOBIL CORP. v. ALLAPATTAH SERVICES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nreached in Finley.\n   Finally, it is suggested that our interpretation of\n\u00a71367(a) creates an anomaly regarding the exceptions\nlisted in \u00a71367(b): It is not immediately obvious why Con-\ngress would withhold supplemental jurisdiction over\nplaintiffs joined as parties \u201cneeded for just adjudication\u201d\nunder Rule 19 but would allow supplemental jurisdiction\nover plaintiffs permissively joined under Rule 20. The\nomission of Rule 20 plaintiffs from the list of exceptions in\n\u00a71367(b) may have been an \u201cunintentional drafting gap,\u201d\nMeritcare, 166 F. 3d, at 221 and n. 6. If that is the case, it\nis up to Congress rather than the courts to fix it. The\nomission may seem odd, but it is not absurd. An alterna-\ntive explanation for the different treatment of Rule 19 and\nRule 20 is that Congress was concerned that extending\nsupplemental jurisdiction to Rule 19 plaintiffs would allow\ncircumvention of the complete diversity rule: A nondiverse\nplaintiff might be omitted intentionally from the original\naction, but joined later under Rule 19 as a necessary\nparty. See Stromberg Metal Works, 77 F. 3d, at 932. The\ncontamination theory described above, if applicable,\nmeans this ruse would fail, but Congress may have\nwanted to make assurance double sure. More generally,\nCongress may have concluded that federal jurisdiction is\nonly appropriate if the district court would have original\njurisdiction over the claims of all those plaintiffs who are\nso essential to the action that they could be joined under\nRule 19.\n   To the extent that the omission of Rule 20 plaintiffs\nfrom the list of \u00a71367(b) exceptions is anomalous, more-\nover, it is no more anomalous than the inclusion of Rule 19\nplaintiffs in that list would be if the alternative view of\n\u00a71367(a) were to prevail. If the district court lacks origi-\nnal jurisdiction over a civil diversity action where any\nplaintiff\u2019s claims fail to comply with all the requirements\nof \u00a71332, there is no need for a special \u00a71367(b) exception\n                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfor Rule 19 plaintiffs who do not meet these requirements.\nThough the omission of Rule 20 plaintiffs from \u00a71367(b)\npresents something of a puzzle on our view of the statute,\nthe inclusion of Rule 19 plaintiffs in this section is at least\nas difficult to explain under the alternative view.\n   And so we circle back to the original question. When the\nwell-pleaded complaint in district court includes multiple\nclaims, all part of the same case or controversy, and some,\nbut not all, of the claims are within the court\u2019s original\njurisdiction, does the court have before it \u201cany civil action\nof which the district courts have original jurisdiction\u201d? It\ndoes. Under \u00a71367, the court has original jurisdiction over\nthe civil action comprising the claims for which there is no\njurisdictional defect. No other reading of \u00a71367 is plausi-\nble in light of the text and structure of the jurisdictional\nstatute. Though the special nature and purpose of the\ndiversity requirement mean that a single nondiverse party\ncan contaminate every other claim in the lawsuit, the\ncontamination does not occur with respect to jurisdictional\ndefects that go only to the substantive importance of indi-\nvidual claims.\n   It follows from this conclusion that the threshold re-\nquirement of \u00a71367(a) is satisfied in cases, like those now\nbefore us, where some, but not all, of the plaintiffs in a\ndiversity action allege a sufficient amount in controversy.\nWe hold that \u00a71367 by its plain text overruled Clark and\nZahn and authorized supplemental jurisdiction over all\nclaims by diverse parties arising out of the same Article\nIII case or controversy, subject only to enumerated excep-\ntions not applicable in the cases now before us.\n                              C\n  The proponents of the alternative view of \u00a71367 insist\nthat the statute is at least ambiguous and that we should\nlook to other interpretive tools, including the legislative\nhistory of \u00a71367, which supposedly demonstrate Congress\n20   EXXON MOBIL CORP. v. ALLAPATTAH SERVICES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndid not intend \u00a71367 to overrule Zahn. We can reject this\nargument at the very outset simply because \u00a71367 is not\nambiguous. For the reasons elaborated above, interpret-\ning \u00a71367 to foreclose supplemental jurisdiction over\nplaintiffs in diversity cases who do not meet the minimum\namount in controversy is inconsistent with the text, read\nin light of other statutory provisions and our established\njurisprudence. Even if we were to stipulate, however, that\nthe reading these proponents urge upon us is textually\nplausible, the legislative history cited to support it would\nnot alter our view as to the best interpretation of \u00a71367.\n   Those who urge that the legislative history refutes our\ninterpretation rely primarily on the House Judiciary\nCommittee Report on the Judicial Improvements Act.\nH. R. Rep. No. 101\u2013734 (1990) (House Report or Report).\nThis Report explained that \u00a71367 would \u201cauthorize juris-\ndiction in a case like Finley, as well as essentially restore\nthe pre-Finley understandings of the authorization for and\nlimits on other forms of supplemental jurisdiction.\u201d House\nReport, at 28. The Report stated that \u00a71367(a) \u201cgenerally\nauthorizes the district court to exercise jurisdiction over a\nsupplemental claim whenever it forms part of the same\nconstitutional case or controversy as the claim or claims\nthat provide the basis of the district court\u2019s original juris-\ndiction,\u201d and in so doing codifies Gibbs and fills the statu-\ntory gap recognized in Finley. House Report, at 28\u201329,\nand n. 15. The Report then remarked that \u00a71367(b) \u201cis not\nintended to affect the jurisdictional requirements of\n[\u00a71332] in diversity-only class actions, as those require-\nments were interpreted prior to Finley,\u201d citing, without\nfurther elaboration, Zahn and Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur\nv.

(It is\nevident that the report here meant to refer to Rule 24, not\nRule 23.)\n   As we have repeatedly held, the authoritative statement\nis the statutory text, not the legislative history or any\nother extrinsic material. Extrinsic materials have a role\nin statutory interpretation only to the extent they shed a\nreliable light on the enacting Legislature\u2019s understanding\nof otherwise ambiguous terms. Not all extrinsic materials\nare reliable sources of insight into legislative understand-\nings, however, and legislative history in particular is\nvulnerable to two serious criticisms. First, legislative\nhistory is itself often murky, ambiguous, and contradic-\ntory. Judicial investigation of legislative history has a\ntendency to become, to borrow Judge Leventhal\u2019s memo-\nrable phrase, an exercise in \u201c \u2018looking over a crowd and\npicking out your friends.\u2019 \u201d See Wald, Some Observations\non the Use of Legislative History in the 1981 Supreme\nCourt Term, 68 Iowa L. Rev. 195, 214 (1983). Second,\njudicial reliance on legislative materials like committee\nreports, which are not themselves subject to the require-\nments of Article I, may give unrepresentative committee\nmembers\u2014or, worse yet, unelected staffers and lobby-\nists\u2014both the power and the incentive to attempt strate-\ngic manipulations of legislative history to secure results\nthey were unable to achieve through the statutory text.\nWe need not comment here on whether these problems are\nsufficiently prevalent to render legislative history inher-\nently unreliable in all circumstances, a point on which\nMembers of this Court have disagreed. It is clear, how-\never, that in this instance both criticisms are right on the\nmark.\n   First of all, the legislative history of \u00a71367 is far murk-\nier than selective quotation from the House Report would\n22   EXXON MOBIL CORP. v. ALLAPATTAH SERVICES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsuggest. The text of \u00a71367 is based substantially on a\ndraft proposal contained in a Federal Court Study Com-\nmittee working paper, which was drafted by a Subcommit-\ntee chaired by Judge Posner. Report of the Subcommittee\non the Role of the Federal Courts and Their Relationship\nto the States 567\u2013568 (Mar. 12, 1990), reprinted in Judi-\ncial Conference of the United States, 1 Federal Courts\nStudy Committee, Working Papers and Subcommittee\nReports (July 1, 1990). See also Judicial Conference of the\nUnited States, Report of the Federal Courts Study Com-\nmittee 47\u201348 (Apr. 2, 1990) (Study Committee Report)\n(echoing, in brief summary form, the Subcommittee Work-\ning Paper proposal and noting that the Subcommittee\nWorking Paper \u201ccontains additional material on this\nsubject\u201d); House Report, at 27 (\u201c[Section 1367] implements\na recommendation of the Federal Courts Study Committee\nfound on pages 47 and 48 of its report\u201d). While the Sub-\ncommittee explained, in language echoed by the House\nReport, that its proposal \u201cbasically restores the law as it\nexisted prior to Finley,\u201d Subcommittee Working Paper, at\n561, it observed in a footnote that its proposal would\noverrule Zahn and that this would be a good idea, Sub-\ncommittee Working Paper, at 561, n. 33. Although the\nFederal Courts Study Committee did not expressly adopt\nthe Subcommittee\u2019s specific reference to Zahn, it neither\nexplicitly disagreed with the Subcommittee\u2019s conclusion\nthat this was the best reading of the proposed text nor\nsubstantially modified the proposal to avoid this result.\nStudy Committee Report, at 47\u201348. Therefore, even if the\nHouse Report could fairly be read to reflect an under-\nstanding that the text of \u00a71367 did not overrule Zahn, the\nSubcommittee Working Paper on which \u00a71367 was based\nreflected the opposite understanding. The House Report is\nno more authoritative than the Subcommittee Working\nPaper. The utility of either can extend no further than the\nlight it sheds on how the enacting Legislature understood\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe statutory text. Trying to figure out how to square the\nSubcommittee Working Paper\u2019s understanding with the\nHouse Report\u2019s understanding, or which is more reflective\nof the understanding of the enacting legislators, is a hope-\nless task.\n   Second, the worst fears of critics who argue legislative\nhistory will be used to circumvent the Article I process\nwere realized in this case. The telltale evidence is the\nstatement, by three law professors who participated in\ndrafting \u00a71367, see House Report, at 27, n. 13, that \u00a71367\n\u201con its face\u201d permits \u201csupplemental jurisdiction over\nclaims of class members that do not satisfy section 1332\u2019s\njurisdictional amount requirement, which would overrule\n[Zahn]. [There is] a disclaimer of intent to accomplish this\nresult in the legislative history. . . . It would have been\nbetter had the statute dealt explicitly with this problem,\nand the legislative history was an attempt to correct the\noversight.\u201d Rowe, Burbank, & Mengler, Compounding or\nCreating Confusion About Supplemental Jurisdiction? A\nReply to Professor Freer, 40 Emory L. J. 943, 960, n. 90\n(1991). The professors were frank to concede that if one\nrefuses to consider the legislative history, one has no\nchoice but to \u201cconclude that section 1367 has wiped Zahn\noff the books.\u201d Ibid. So there exists an acknowledgment,\nby parties who have detailed, specific knowledge of the\nstatute and the drafting process, both that the plain text\nof \u00a71367 overruled Zahn and that language to the contrary\nin the House Report was a post hoc attempt to alter that\nresult. One need not subscribe to the wholesale condem-\nnation of legislative history to refuse to give any effect to\nsuch a deliberate effort to amend a statute through a\ncommittee report.\n   In sum, even if we believed resort to legislative history\nwere appropriate in these cases\u2014a point we do not con-\ncede\u2014we would not give significant weight to the House\nReport. The distinguished jurists who drafted the Sub-\n24   EXXON MOBIL CORP. v. ALLAPATTAH SERVICES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncommittee Working Paper, along with three of the partici-\npants in the drafting of \u00a71367, agree that this provision,\non its face, overrules Zahn. This accords with the best\nreading of the statute\u2019s text, and nothing in the legislative\nhistory indicates directly and explicitly that Congress\nunderstood the phrase \u201ccivil action of which the district\ncourts have original jurisdiction\u201d to exclude cases in which\nsome but not all of the diversity plaintiffs meet the\namount in controversy requirement.\n   No credence, moreover, can be given to the claim that, if\nCongress understood \u00a71367 to overrule Zahn, the proposal\nwould have been more controversial. We have little sense\nwhether any Member of Congress would have been par-\nticularly upset by this result. This is not a case where one\ncan plausibly say that concerned legislators might not\nhave realized the possible effect of the text they were\nadopting. Certainly, any competent legislative aide who\nstudied the matter would have flagged this issue if it were\na matter of importance to his or her boss, especially in\nlight of the Subcommittee Working Paper. There are any\nnumber of reasons why legislators did not spend more\ntime arguing over \u00a71367, none of which are relevant to our\ninterpretation of what the words of the statute mean.\n                             D\n  Finally, we note that the Class Action Fairness Act\n(CAFA), Pub. L. 109\u20132, 119 Stat. 4, enacted this year, has\nno bearing on our analysis of these cases. Subject to cer-\ntain limitations, the CAFA confers federal diversity juris-\ndiction over class actions where the aggregate amount in\ncontroversy exceeds $5 million. It abrogates the rule\nagainst aggregating claims, a rule this Court recognized in\nBen-Hur and reaffirmed in Zahn. The CAFA, however, is\nnot retroactive, and the views of the 2005 Congress are not\nrelevant to our interpretation of a text enacted by Con-\ngress in 1990. The CAFA, moreover, does not moot the\n                 Cite as: 545 U.

Because ambiguity is apparently in the eye of\nthe beholder, I remain convinced that it is unwise to treat\nthe ambiguity vel non of a statute as determinative of\nwhether legislative history is consulted.

C. \u00a71367 provides\npowerful confirmation of JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s interpreta-\ntion of that statute. It is helpful to consider in full the\nrelevant portion of the House Report, which was also\nadopted by the Senate:\n    \u201cThis section would authorize jurisdiction in a case\n    like Finley [v. United States, 490 U. S. 545 (1989)], as\n    well as essentially restore the pre-Finley understand-\n    ings of the authorization for and limits on other forms\n    of supplemental jurisdiction. In federal question\n    cases, it broadly authorizes the district courts to exer-\n    cise supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims,\n    including claims involving the joinder of additional\n    parties. In diversity cases, the district courts may ex-\n    ercise supplemental jurisdiction, except when doing so\n    would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional require-\n    ments of the diversity statute.\n         .           .          .           .           .\n       \u201cSubsection 114(b) [\u00a71367(b)] prohibits a district\n    court in a case over which it has jurisdiction founded\n    solely on the general diversity provision, 28 U. S. C.\n    \u00a71332, from exercising supplemental jurisdiction in\n    specified circumstances. [Footnote 16: \u2018The net effect\n    of subsection (b) is to implement the principal ration-\n    ale of Owen Equipment & Erection Co. v. Kroger, 437\n    U.

In accord with case\n     law, the subsection also prohibits the joinder or inter-\n     vention of persons a plaintiffs if adding them is incon-\n     sistent with section 1332\u2019s requirements. The section\n     is not intended to affect the jurisdictional require-\n     ments of 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332 in diversity-only class ac-\n     tions, as those requirements were interpreted prior to\n     Finley. [Footnote 17: \u2018See Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur\n     v. Cauble, 255 U.

Anomalously, under current practice,\n     the same party might intervene as of right under Fed-\n     eral Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and take advantage\n     of supplemental jurisdiction, but not come within\n     supplemental jurisdiction if parties already in the ac-\n     tion sought to effect the joinder under Rule 19. Sub-\n     section (b) would eliminate this anomaly, excluding\n     Rule 23(a) plaintiff-intervenors to the same extent as\n     those sought to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19.\u201d\n     H. R. Rep.

International Paper Co.,\n414 U. S. 291 (1973), but its entire explanation of the\nstatute demonstrates that Congress had in mind a very\nspecific and relatively modest task\u2014undoing this Court\u2019s\n5-to-4 decision in Finley v. United States, 490 U. S. 545\n(1989). In addition to overturning that unfortunate and\nmuch-criticized decision,2 the statute, according to the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The  last quoted paragraph was intended to refer to Rule 24, not\nRule 23. See ante, at 21.\n  2 As I pointed out in my dissent in Finley, the majority's decision was\n\n\u201cnot faithful to our precedents,\u201d 490 U.

But this does not seem to trou-\nble the Court, for its decision today treats statutory inter-\npretation as a pedantic exercise, divorced from any serious\nattempt at ascertaining congressional intent. Of course,\nthere are situations in which we do not honor Congress\u2019\napparent intent unless that intent is made \u201cclear\u201d in the\ntext of a statute\u2014in this way, we can be certain that\nCongress considered the issue and intended a disfavored\noutcome, see, e.g., Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S.\n244 (1994) (requiring clear statement for retroactive civil\nlegislation). But that principle provides no basis for dis-\ncounting the House Report, given that our cases have\nnever recognized a presumption in favor of expansive\ndiversity jurisdiction.\n   The Court\u2019s reasons for ignoring this virtual billboard of\ncongressional intent are unpersuasive. That a subcommit-\ntee of the Federal Courts Study Committee believed that\nan earlier, substantially similar version of the statute\noverruled Zahn, see ante, at 22, only highlights the fact\nthat the statute is ambiguous. What is determinative is\nthat the House Report explicitly rejected that broad read-\ning of the statutory text. Such a report has special signifi-\ncance as an indicator of legislative intent. In Congress,\ncommittee reports are normally considered the authorita-\ntive explication of a statute\u2019s text and purposes, and busy\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nmissed the accumulated wisdom of judges such as Henry Friendly, who \n\nhad \u201cspecial learning and expertise in matters of federal jurisdiction,\"\n\nid., at 565. \n\n                      Cite as: 545 U.

United States, 469 U. S.\n70, 76 (1984) (\u201cIn surveying legislative history we have\nrepeatedly stated that the authoritative source for finding\nthe Legislature\u2019s intent lies in the Committee Reports on\nthe bill, which \u2018represen[t] the considered and collective\nunderstanding of those Congressmen involved in drafting\nand studying proposed legislation\u2019 \u201d (quoting Zuber v.\nAllen, 396 U. S. 168, 186 (1969)) (brackets in original)).\n   The Court\u2019s second reason\u2014its comment on the three\nlaw professors who participated in drafting \u00a71367, see\nante, at 23\u2014is similarly off the mark. In the law review\narticle that the Court refers to, the professors were merely\nsaying that the text of the statute was susceptible to an\noverly broad (and simplistic) reading, and that clarifica-\ntion in the House Report was therefore appropriate. See\nRowe, Burbank, & Mengler, Compounding or Creating\nConfusion About Supplemental Jurisdiction? A Reply to\nProfessor Freer, 40 Emory L. J. 943, 960, n. 90 (1991).3\nSignificantly, the reference to Zahn in the House Report\ndoes not at all appear to be tacked-on or out of place;\nindeed, it is wholly consistent with the Report\u2019s broader\nexplanation of Congress\u2019 goal of overruling Finley and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The  professors\u2019 account of the challenges they faced in drafting\n\u00a71367 gives some sense, I think, of why that statute has proved difficult\nto interpret: \u201cMore broadly, codifying a complex area like supplemental\njurisdiction\u2014as Professor Freer\u2019s discussion illustrates\u2014is itself\ncomplex business. A danger is that that result of the effort to deal with\nall the foreseeables will be a statute too prolix and baroque for every-\nday use and application by practitioners and judges. Section 1367\nreflects an effort to provide sufficient detail without overdoing it. The\nstatute is concededly not perfect. What it accomplishes, however, is to\nchange the direction taken by the Supreme Court in Finley, to provide\nbasic guidance (in particular the legislative history\u2019s general approval\nof pre-Finley case law, which has treated some specific issues Professor\nFreer raises), and then to trust the federal courts under the changed\ndirection to interpret the statute sensibly. . . .\u201d 40 Emory L.

To suggest that these profes-\nsors participated in a \u201cdeliberate effort to amend a statute\nthrough a committee report,\u201d ante, at 23, reveals an unre-\nalistic view of the legislative process, not to mention disre-\nspect for three law professors who acted in the role of\npublic servants. To be sure, legislative history can be\nmanipulated.

S. 39, 40 (1911)), and Zahn v. International\nPaper Co., 414 U. S. 291 (1973). Clark held that, when\nfederal-court jurisdiction is predicated on a specified\namount in controversy, each plaintiff joined in the litiga-\ntion must independently meet the jurisdictional amount\nrequirement. Zahn confirmed that in class actions gov-\nerned by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), \u201c[e]ach\n[class member] . . . must satisfy the jurisdictional amount,\nand any [class member] who does not must be dismissed\nfrom the case.\u201d 414 U.

ALLAPATTAH SERVICES, INC.\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n(1989). Finley concerned not diversity-of-citizenship juris-\ndiction (28 U. S. C. \u00a71332), but original federal-court\njurisdiction in cases arising under federal law (28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71331). The plaintiff in Finley sued the United States\nunder the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71346(b), to recover for the death of her husband and\nchildren in an airplane crash. She alleged that the Fed-\neral Aviation Administration\u2019s negligence contributed to\nthe fatal accident. She later amended her complaint to\nadd state-law tort claims against two other defendants, a\nmunicipality and a utility company. 490 U. S., at 546\u2013\n547. No independent basis for federal subject-matter\njurisdiction existed over the state-law claims. The plain-\ntiff could not have brought her entire action in state court,\nbecause federal jurisdiction in FTCA actions is exclusive.\n\u00a71346(b). Hence, absent federal jurisdiction embracing\nthe state-law claims, she would be obliged to pursue two\ndiscrete actions, one in federal court, the other in state\ncourt. This Court held, nevertheless, that the District\nCourt lacked jurisdiction over the \u201cpendent-party\u201d state-\nlaw claims. Id., at 555\u2013556. In so holding, the Court\nstressed that Congress held the control rein. Id., at 547\u2013\n549. Congress could reverse the result in Finley, and\npermit pendent jurisdiction over state-law claims against\nadditional defendants, if it so chose. Id., at 556. Congress\ndid so in \u00a71367.\n   What more \u00a71367 wrought is an issue on which courts of\nappeals have sharply divided. Compare Stromberg Metal\nWorks, Inc. v. Press Mechanical, Inc., 77 F. 3d 928, 930\n(CA7 1996) (\u00a71367 \u201csupersedes Clark and allows pendent-\nparty jurisdiction when the additional parties have claims\nworth less than [the jurisdictional minimum]\u201d), and In re\nAbbott Labs., 51 F. 3d 524, 529 (CA5 1995) (\u201c[U]nder\n\u00a71367 a district court can exercise supplemental jurisdic-\ntion over members of a class, although they did not meet\nthe amount-in-controversy requirement, as did the class\n                 Cite as: 545 U.

Western Sugar Co., 160 F. 3d\n631, 641 (CA10 1998) (\u00a71367 does not alter \u201cthe historical\nrules prohibiting aggregation of claims, including Zahn\u2019s\nprohibition of such aggregation in diversity class actions\u201d).\nThe Court today holds that \u00a71367, although prompted by\nFinley, a case in which original access to federal court was\npredicated on a federal question, notably enlarges federal\ndiversity jurisdiction. The Court reads \u00a71367 to overrule\nClark and Zahn, thereby allowing access to federal court\nby co-plaintiffs or class members who do not meet the now\nin excess of $75,000 amount-in-controversy requirement,\nso long as at least one co-plaintiff, or the named class\nrepresentative, has a jurisdictionally sufficient claim.\nAnte, at 1\u20132.\n   The Court adopts a plausibly broad reading of \u00a71367, a\nmeasure that is hardly a model of the careful drafter\u2019s art.\nThere is another plausible reading, however, one less\ndisruptive of our jurisprudence regarding supplemental\njurisdiction. If one reads \u00a71367(a) to instruct, as the\nstatute\u2019s text suggests, that the district court must first\nhave \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d over a \u201ccivil action\u201d before\nsupplemental jurisdiction can attach, then Clark and\nZahn are preserved, and supplemental jurisdiction does\nnot open the way for joinder of plaintiffs, or inclusion of\nclass members, who do not independently meet the\namount-in-controversy requirement. For the reasons that\nfollow, I conclude that this narrower construction is the\nbetter reading of \u00a71367.\n                             I\n                            A\n  Section 1367, captioned \u201cSupplemental jurisdiction,\u201d\ncodifies court-recognized doctrines formerly labeled \u201cpen-\n4    EXXON MOBIL CORP. v.

Pendent jurisdiction\ninvolved the enlargement of federal-question litigation to\ninclude related state-law claims. Ancillary jurisdiction\nevolved primarily to protect defending parties, or others\nwhose rights might be adversely affected if they could not\nair their claims in an ongoing federal-court action. Given\njurisdiction over the principal action, federal courts enter-\ntained certain matters deemed ancillary regardless of the\ncitizenship of the parties or the amount in controversy.\n   Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U. S. 715 (1966), the leading\npendent jurisdiction case, involved a claim against a union\nfor wrongfully inducing the plaintiff\u2019s discharge. The\nplaintiff stated a federal claim under the Taft-Hartley Act,\nand an allied state-law claim of unlawful conspiracy to\ninterfere with his employment contract. This Court up-\nheld the joinder of federal and state claims. \u201c[T]here is\npower in federal courts to hear the whole,\u201d the Court said,\nwhen the state and federal claims \u201cderive from a common\nnucleus of operative fact\u201d and are so linked that the plaintiff\n\u201cwould ordinarily be expected to try them all in one judicial\nproceeding.\u201d Id., at 725.\n   Gibbs involved the linkage of federal and state claims\nagainst the same defendant. In Finley v. United States,\n490 U. S. 545, the Court contained Gibbs. Without con-\ngressional authorization, the Court admonished, the pen-\ndent jurisdiction umbrella could not be stretched to cover\nthe joinder of additional parties.

Congress did not take up the Study Com-\nmittee\u2019s immodest proposal to curtail diversity jurisdic-\ntion. It did, however, enact a supplemental jurisdiction\nstatute, codified as 28 U. S.

See State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Tashire, 386\nU. S. 523, 530\u2013531 (1967). Further, the Constitution in-\ncludes no amount-in-controversy limitation on the exercise\nof federal jurisdiction. But from the start, Congress, as its\nmeasures have been construed by this Court, has limited\nfederal court exercise of diversity jurisdiction in two prin-\ncipal ways. First, unless Congress specifies otherwise,\ndiversity must be \u201ccomplete,\u201d i.e., all parties on plaintiffs\u2019\nside must be diverse from all parties on defendants\u2019 side.\nStrawbridge v. Curtiss, 3 Cranch 267 (1806); see 13B\nWright & Miller \u00a73605 (2d ed. 1984). Second, each plain-\ntiff\u2019s stake must independently meet the amount-in-\ncontroversy specification: \u201cWhen two or more plaintiffs,\nhaving separate and distinct demands, unite for conven-\nience and economy in a single suit, it is essential that the\ndemand of each be of the requisite jurisdictional amount.\u201d\nTroy Bank, 222 U. S., at 40.\n   The statute today governing federal court exercise of\ndiversity jurisdiction in the generality of cases, \u00a71332, like\nall its predecessors, incorporates both a diverse-citizenship\nrequirement and an amount-in-controversy specification.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Endeavoring to preserve the \u201ccomplete diversity\u201d rule first stated in\n\nStrawbridge v. Curtiss, 3 Cranch 267 (1806), the Court\u2019s opinion drives a\nwedge between the two components of 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332, treating the\ndiversity-of-citizenship requirement as essential, the amount-in-\ncontroversy requirement as more readily disposable. See ante, at 6, 14\u2013\n15. Section 1332 itself, however, does not rank order the two require-\nments. What \u201c[o]rdinary principl[e] of statutory construction\u201d or \u201csound\ncanon of interpretation,\u201d ante, at 10, allows the Court to slice up \u00a71332\nthis way? In partial explanation, the Court asserts that amount in\ncontroversy can be analyzed claim-by-claim, but the diversity require-\nment cannot. See ante, at 6. It is not altogether clear why that should\nbe so. The cure for improper joinder of a nondiverse party is the same\nas the cure for improper joinder of a plaintiff who does not satisfy the\n10    EXXON MOBIL CORP. v. ALLAPATTAH SERVICES, INC.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nAs to the latter, the statute reads: \u201cThe district courts\nshall have original jurisdiction [in diversity-of-citizenship\ncases] where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum\n. . . of $75,000.\u201d \u00a71332(a). This Court has long held that,\nin determining whether the amount-in-controversy re-\nquirement has been satisfied, a single plaintiff may aggre-\ngate two or more claims against a single defendant, even if\nthe claims are unrelated. See, e.g., Edwards v. Bates\nCounty, 163 U. S. 269, 273 (1896). But in multiparty cases,\nincluding class actions, we have unyieldingly adhered to\nthe nonaggregation rule stated in Troy Bank. See Clark,\n306 U. S., at 589 (reaffirming the \u201cfamiliar rule that when\nseveral plaintiffs assert separate and distinct demands in\na single suit, the amount involved in each separate con-\ntroversy must be of the requisite amount to be within the\njurisdiction of the district court, and that those amounts\ncannot be added together to satisfy jurisdictional require-\nments\u201d); Snyder v. Harris, 394 U. S. 332, 339\u2013340 (1969)\n(abandonment of the nonaggregation rule in class actions\nwould undercut the congressional \u201cpurpose . . . to check, to\nsome degree, the rising caseload of the federal courts\u201d).\n    This Court most recently addressed \u201c[t]he meaning of\n[\u00a71332\u2019s] \u2018matter in controversy\u2019 language\u201d in Zahn, 414\nU.

In Snyder, no class member had a\nclaim large enough to satisfy the jurisdictional amount.\nBut in Zahn, the named plaintiffs had such claims. 414\nU. S., at 292. Nevertheless, the Court declined to depart\nfrom its \u201clongstanding construction of the \u2018matter in con-\ntroversy\u2019 requirement of \u00a71332.\u201d Id., at 301.

This rule plainly mandates not only that there\n    may be no aggregation and that the entire case must\n    be dismissed where none of the plaintiffs claims\n    [meets the amount-in-controversy requirement] but\n    also requires that any plaintiff without the jurisdic-\n    tional amount must be dismissed from the case, even\n    though others allege jurisdictionally sufficient\n    claims.\u201d Id., at 300.\nThe rule that each plaintiff must independently satisfy the\namount-in-controversy requirement, unless Congress ex-\npressly orders otherwise, was thus the solidly established\nreading of \u00a71332 when Congress enacted the Judicial\nImprovements Act of 1990, which added \u00a71367 to Title 28.\n                              B\n  These cases present the question whether Congress\nabrogated the nonaggregation rule long tied to \u00a71332\nwhen it enacted \u00a71367. In answering that question, \u201ccon-\ntext [should provide] a crucial guide.\u201d Rosario Ortega v.\nStar-Kist Foods, Inc., 370 F. 3d 124, 135 (2004). The\nCourt should assume, as it ordinarily does, that Congress\nlegislated against a background of law already in place\nand the historical development of that law. See National\nArchives and Records Admin. v. Favish, 541 U. S. 157, 169\n(2004). Here, that background is the statutory grant of\ndiversity jurisdiction, the amount-in-controversy condition\nthat Congress, from the start, has tied to the grant, and\nthe nonaggregation rule this Court has long applied to the\ndetermination of the \u201cmatter in controversy.\u201d\n  Section 1367(a) provides:\n12    EXXON MOBIL CORP. v. ALLAPATTAH SERVICES, INC.\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n     \u201cExcept as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as\n     expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute, in\n     any civil action of which the district courts have origi-\n     nal jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supple-\n     mental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so\n     related to claims in the action within such original ju-\n     risdiction that they form part of the same case or con-\n     troversy under Article III of the United States Consti-\n     tution. Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include\n     claims that involve the joinder or intervention of addi-\n     tional parties.\u201d\nThe Court is unanimous in reading \u00a71367(a) to permit\npendent-party jurisdiction in federal-question cases, and\nthus, to overrule Finley. The basic jurisdictional grant,\n\u00a71331, provides that \u201c[t]he district courts shall have origi-\nnal jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Con-\nstitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d Since\n1980, \u00a71331 has contained no amount-in-controversy\nrequirement. See 94 Stat. 2369 (eliminating \u00a71331\u2019s\namount-in-controversy requirement). Once there is a civil\naction presenting a qualifying claim arising under federal\nlaw, \u00a71331\u2019s sole requirement is met. District courts, we\nhave held, may then adjudicate, additionally, state-law\nclaims \u201cderiv[ing] from a common nucleus of operative\nfact.\u201d Gibbs, 383 U. S., at 725. Section 1367(a) enlarges\nthat category to include not only state-law claims against\nthe defendant named in the federal claim, but also \u201c[state-\nlaw] claims that involve the joinder or intervention of\nadditional parties.\u201d6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The Court noted in Zahn, 414 U.

Under the major-\nity\u2019s reading, \u00a71367(a) permits the joinder of related\nclaims cut loose from the nonaggregation rule that has\nlong attended actions under \u00a71332. Only the claims speci-\nfied in \u00a71367(b)7 would be excluded from \u00a71367(a)\u2019s expan-\nsion of \u00a71332\u2019s grant of diversity jurisdiction. And because\n\u00a71367(b) contains no exception for joinder of plaintiffs\nunder Rule 20 or class actions under Rule 23, the Court\nconcludes, Clark and Zahn have been overruled.8\n   The Court\u2019s reading is surely plausible, especially if one\ndetaches \u00a71367(a) from its context and attempts no recon-\nciliation with prior interpretations of \u00a71332\u2019s amount-in-\ncontroversy requirement. But \u00a71367(a)\u2019s text, as the First\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nimpact of \u00a71331\u2019s \u201cmatter in controversy\u201d specification in cases arising\nunder federal law.

Rule Civ. Proc. 20. If, however, their\npresence was \u201cneeded for just adjudication,\u201d Rule 19, their dismissal\nwould be required. The inclusion of those who may join, and exclusion\nof those who should or must join, defies rational explanation, but cf.\nante, at 18, and others adopting the interpretation the Court embraces\nhave so acknowledged, see Stromberg Metal Works, Inc. v. Press Me-\nchanical, Inc., 77 F. 3d 928, 932 (CA7 1996) (recognizing the anomaly\nand inquiring: \u201cWhat sense can this make?\u201d); cf. 14B Wright & Miller\n\u00a73704, p. 168 (3d ed. 1998) (distinction between Rule 19 and Rule 20\n\u201cseems incongruous, and serves no apparent public policy purpose\u201d).\n14    EXXON MOBIL CORP. v.

On this reading, a com-\nplaint must first meet that \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d meas-\nurement. If it does not, no supplemental jurisdiction is\nauthorized. If it does, \u00a71367(a) authorizes \u201csupplemental\njurisdiction\u201d over related claims. In other words, \u00a71367(a)\nwould preserve undiminished, as part and parcel of \u00a71332\n\u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d determinations, both the \u201ccomplete\ndiversity\u201d rule and the decisions restricting aggregation to\narrive at the amount in controversy.9 Section 1367(b)\u2019s\noffice, then, would be \u201cto prevent the erosion of the com-\nplete diversity [and amount-in-controversy] require-\nment[s] that might otherwise result from an expansive\napplication of what was once termed the doctrine of ancil-\nlary jurisdiction.\u201d See Pfander, Supplemental Jurisdiction\nand Section 1367: The Case for a Sympathetic Textualism,\n148 U.

In\ncontrast to the Court\u2019s construction of \u00a71367, which draws\na sharp line between the diversity and amount-in-\ncontroversy components of \u00a71332, see ante, at 6; supra, at\n9, n. 5, the interpretation presented here does not sever\nthe two jurisdictional requirements.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 On this reading of \u00a71367(a), it is immaterial that \u00a71367(b) \u201cdoes not\n\nwithdraw supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of the additional\nparties at issue here.\u201d Ante, at 12.

It would not discard entirely, as the Court does,\nthe judicially developed doctrines of pendent and ancillary\njurisdiction as they existed when Finley was decided.10\nInstead, it would recognize \u00a71367 essentially as a codifica-\ntion of those doctrines, placing them under a single head-\ning, but largely retaining their substance, with overriding\nFinley the only basic change: Supplemental jurisdiction,\nonce the district court has original jurisdiction, would now\ninclude \u201cclaims that involve the joinder or intervention of\nadditional parties.\u201d \u00a71367(a).\n   Pendent jurisdiction, as earlier explained, see supra, at\n4\u20135, applied only in federal-question cases and allowed\nplaintiffs to attach nonfederal claims to their jurisdiction-\nqualifying claims. Ancillary jurisdiction applied primarily,\nalthough not exclusively, in diversity cases and \u201ctypically\ninvolve[d] claims by a defending party haled into court\nagainst his will.\u201d Kroger, 437 U. S., at 376 (emphasis\nadded); see also id., at 375, n. 18; supra, at 5\u20136. As the\nFirst Circuit observed, neither doctrine permitted a plain-\ntiff to circumvent the dual requirements of \u00a71332 (diver-\nsity of citizenship and amount in controversy) \u201csimply by\njoining her [jurisdictionally inadequate] claim in an action\nbrought by [a] jurisdictionally competent diversity plain-\ntiff.\u201d Ortega, 370 F. 3d, at 138.\n   Not only would the reading I find persuasive \u201calig[n]\nstatutory supplemental jurisdiction with the judicially\ndeveloped doctrines of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction,\u201d\nibid., it would also synchronize \u00a71367 with the removal\nstatute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71441.

ALLAPATTAH SERVICES, INC.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n     \u201cSection 1441, like \u00a71367, applies only if the \u2018civil ac-\n     tion\u2019 in question is one \u2018of which the district courts . . .\n     have original jurisdiction.\u2019 \u00a71441(a). Relying on that\n     language, the Supreme Court has interpreted \u00a71441\n     to prohibit removal unless the entire action, as it\n     stands at the time of removal, could have been filed in\n     federal court in the first instance. See, e.g., Syngenta\n     Crop Protection, Inc. v. Henson, 537 U. S. 28, 33\n     (2002); Okla. Tax Comm\u2019n v. Graham, 489 U. S. 838,\n     840 (1989) (per curiam). Section 1441 has thus been\n     held to incorporate the well-pleaded complaint rule,\n     see City of Chicago [v. International College of Sur-\n     geons, 522 U. S. 156, 163 (1997)];11 the complete di-\n     versity rule, see Caterpillar, Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U.

If one reads \u00a71367(a) as a ple-\nnary grant of supplemental jurisdiction to federal courts\nsitting in diversity, one would indeed look for exceptions in\n\u00a71367(b). Finding none for permissive joinder of parties or\nclass actions, one would conclude that Congress effec-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 The  point of the Court\u2019s extended discussion of Chicago v.

There was no disagreement in that\ncase, and there is none now, that 28 U. S. C. \u00a71367(a) is properly read\nto authorize the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction in removed cases.\nInternational College of Surgeons was unusual in that the federal court\nthere was asked to review a decision of a local administrative agency.\nSuch review, it was unsuccessfully argued, was \u201cappellate\u201d in charac-\nter, and therefore outside the ken of a court empowered to exercise\n\u201coriginal\u201d jurisdiction. Compare 522 U. S., at 166\u2013168, with id., at 176\u2013\n177 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting).\n                  Cite as: 545 U.

Congress would have no reason to\nresort to a \u00a71367(b) exception to turn such plaintiffs away\nfrom federal court, given that their claims, from the start,\nwould fall outside the court\u2019s \u00a71332 jurisdiction. See\nPfander, 148 U. Pa. L. Rev., at 148.\n   Nor does the more moderate reading assign different\nmeanings to \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d in diversity and fed-\neral-question cases. See ante, at 14. As the First Circuit\nstated:\n    \u201c \u2018[O]riginal jurisdiction\u2019 in \u00a71367(a) has the same\n    meaning in every case: [An] underlying statutory\n    grant of original jurisdiction must be satisfied. What\n    differs between federal question and diversity cases is\n    not the meaning of \u2018original jurisdiction\u2019 but rather\n    the [discrete] requirements of sections 1331 and 1332.\n    Under \u00a71331, the sole issue is whether a federal ques-\n    tion appears on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s well-pleaded\n    complaint; the [citizenship] of the parties and the\n    amounts they stand to recover [do not bear on that de-\n    termination]. Section 1332, by contrast, predicates\n    original jurisdiction on the identity of the parties (i.e.,\n    [their] complete diversity) and their [satisfaction of\n    the amount-in-controversy specification]. [In short,]\n    the \u2018original jurisdiction\u2019 language in \u00a71367 operates\n    differently in federal-question and diversity cases not\n    because the meaning of that term varies, but because\n    the [jurisdiction-granting] statutes are different.\u201d Or-\n    tega, 370 F. 3d, at 139\u2013140.\n  What is the utility of \u00a71367(b) under my reading of\n18    EXXON MOBIL CORP. v. ALLAPATTAH SERVICES, INC.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n\u00a71367(a)? Section 1367(a) allows parties other than the\nplaintiff to assert reactive claims once entertained under\nthe heading ancillary jurisdiction. See supra, at 5 (listing\nclaims, including compulsory counterclaims and impleader\nclaims, over which federal courts routinely exercised\nancillary jurisdiction). As earlier observed, see supra, at\n14, \u00a71367(b) stops plaintiffs from circumventing \u00a71332\u2019s\njurisdictional requirements by using another\u2019s claim as a\nhook to add a claim that the plaintiff could not have\nbrought in the first instance. Kroger is the paradigm case.\nSee supra, at 5\u20136. There, the Court held that ancillary\njurisdiction did not extend to a plaintiff\u2019s claim against a\nnondiverse party who had been impleaded by the defen-\ndant under Rule 14. Section 1367(b), then, is corrobora-\ntive of \u00a71367(a)\u2019s coverage of claims formerly called ancil-\nlary, but provides exceptions to assure that accommo-\ndation of added claims would not fundamentally alter \u201cthe\njurisdictional requirements of section 1332.\u201d See Pfander,\nsupra, at 135\u2013137.\n   While \u00a71367\u2019s enigmatic text12 defies flawless interpre-\ntation, see supra, at 13, n. 8,13 the precedent-preservative\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 The Court notes the passage this year of the Class Action Fairness\n\nAct (CAFA), Pub. L. 109\u20132, 119 Stat. 4, ante, at 24\u201325, only to dismiss\nthat legislation as irrelevant. Subject to several exceptions and qualifi-\ncations, CAFA provides for federal-court adjudication of state-law-\nbased class actions in which diversity is \u201cminimal\u201d (one plaintiff\u2019s\ndiversity from one defendant suffices), and the \u201cmatter in controversy\u201d\nis an aggregate amount in excess of $5,000,000. Significant here,\nCAFA\u2019s enlargement of federal-court diversity jurisdiction was accom-\nplished, \u201cclearly and conspicuously,\u201d by amending \u00a71332. Cf. Rosario\nOrtega, 370 F. 3d 124, 142 (CA1 2004).\n   13 If \u00a71367(a) itself renders unnecessary the listing of Rule 20 plain-\n\ntiffs and Rule 23 class actions in \u00a71367(b), see supra, at 16\u201317, then it\nis similarly unnecessary to refer, as \u00a71367(b) does, to \u201cpersons proposed\nto be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19.\u201d On one account, Congress\nbracketed such persons with persons \u201cseeking to intervene as plaintiffs\nunder Rule 24\u201d to modify pre-\u00a71367 practice.

Our decision turns on the correct interpretation of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1367. The question has divided the Courts of Appeals, and we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 543 U. S. 924 (2004).</p>\n<p>We hold that, where the other elements of jurisdiction are present and at least one named plaintiff in the action satisfies the amount-in-controversy requirement, \u00a7 1367 does authorize supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of other plaintiffs in the same Article III case or controversy, even if those claims are for less than the jurisdictional amount specified in the statute setting forth the requirements for diversity jurisdiction. We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in No. 04-70, and we reverse <span class=\"star-pagination\">*550</span> the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in No. 04-79.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In 1991, about 10,000 Exxon dealers filed a class-action suit against the Exxon Corporation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida. The dealers alleged an intentional and systematic scheme by Exxon under which they were overcharged for fuel purchased from Exxon. The plaintiffs invoked the District Court's \u00a7 1332(a) diversity jurisdiction. After a unanimous jury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, the District Court certified the case for interlocutory review, asking whether it had properly exercised \u00a7 1367 supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of class members who did not meet the jurisdictional minimum amount in controversy.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld the District Court's extension of supplemental jurisdiction to these class members. <i>Allapattah Services, Inc.</i> v. <i>Exxon Corp.,</i> 333 F. 3d 1248 (2003). \"[W]e find,\" the court held, \"that \u00a7 1367 clearly and unambiguously provides district courts with the authority in diversity class actions to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of class members who do not meet the minimum amount in controversy as long as the district court has original jurisdiction over the claims of at least one of the class representatives.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1256. This decision accords with the views of the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits. See <i>Rosmer</i> v. <i>Pfizer, Inc.,</i> 263 F. 3d 110 (CA4 2001); <i>Olden</i> v. <i>LaFarge Corp.,</i> 383 F. 3d 495 (CA6 2004); <i>Stromberg Metal Works, Inc.</i> v. <i>Press Mechanical, Inc.,</i> 77 F. 3d 928 (CA7 1996); <i>In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litigation,</i> 123 F. 3d 599 (CA7 1997). The Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Ninth Circuits, adopting a similar analysis of the statute, have held that in a diversity class action the unnamed class members need not meet the amount-in-controversy requirement, provided the named class members <span class=\"star-pagination\">*551</span> do. These decisions, however, are unclear on whether all the named plaintiffs must satisfy this requirement. <i>In re Abbott Labs.,</i> 51 F. 3d 524 (CA5 1995); <i>Gibson</i> v. <i>Chrysler Corp.,</i> 261 F. 3d 927 (CA9 2001).</p>\n<p>In the other case now before us the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit took a different position on the meaning of \u00a7 1367(a). 370 F. 3d 124 (2004). In that case, a 9-year-old girl sued Star-Kist in a diversity action in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, seeking damages for unusually severe injuries she received when she sliced her finger on a tuna can. Her family joined in the suit, seeking damages for emotional distress and certain medical expenses. The District Court granted summary judgment to Star-Kist, finding that none of the plaintiffs met the minimum amount-in-controversy requirement. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, however, ruled that the injured girl, but not her family members, had made allegations of damages in the requisite amount.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals then addressed whether, in light of the fact that one plaintiff met the requirements for original jurisdiction, supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining plaintiffs' claims was proper under \u00a7 1367. The court held that \u00a7 1367 authorizes supplemental jurisdiction only when the district court has original jurisdiction over the action, and that in a diversity case original jurisdiction is lacking if one plaintiff fails to satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement. Although the Court of Appeals claimed to \"express no view\" on whether the result would be the same in a class action, <i>id.,</i> at 143, n. 19, its analysis is inconsistent with that of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit's view of \u00a7 1367 is, however, shared by the Courts of Appeals for the Third, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits, and the latter two Courts of Appeals have expressly applied this rule to class actions. See <i>Meritcare, Inc.</i> v. <i>St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co.,</i> 166 F. 3d 214 (CA3 1999); <i>Trimble</i> v. <i>Asarco, Inc.,</i> 232 F. 3d 946 (CA8 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*552</span> 2000); <i>Leonhardt</i> v. <i>Western Sugar Co.,</i> 160 F. 3d 631 (CA10 1998).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The district courts of the United States, as we have said many times, are \"courts of limited jurisdiction. They possess only that power authorized by Constitution and statute,\" <i>Kokkonen</i> v. <i>Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America,</i> 511 U. S. 375, 377 (1994). In order to provide a federal forum for plaintiffs who seek to vindicate federal rights, Congress has conferred on the district courts original jurisdiction in federal-question cases\u0097civil actions that arise under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1331. In order to provide a neutral forum for what have come to be known as diversity cases, Congress also has granted district courts original jurisdiction in civil actions between citizens of different States, between U. S. citizens and foreign citizens, or by foreign states against U. S. citizens. \u00a7 1332. To ensure that diversity jurisdiction does not flood the federal courts with minor disputes, \u00a7 1332(a) requires that the matter in controversy in a diversity case exceed a specified amount, currently $75,000.</p>\n<p>Although the district courts may not exercise jurisdiction absent a statutory basis, it is well established\u0097in certain classes of cases\u0097that, once a court has original jurisdiction over some claims in the action, it may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims that are part of the same case or controversy. The leading modern case for this principle is <i>Mine Workers</i> v. <i>Gibbs,</i> 383 U. S. 715 (1966). In <i>Gibbs,</i> the plaintiff alleged the defendant's conduct violated both federal and state law. The District Court, <i>Gibbs</i> held, had original jurisdiction over the action based on the federal claims. <i>Gibbs</i> confirmed that the District Court had the additional power (though not the obligation) to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over related state claims that arose from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*553</span> the same Article III case or controversy. <i>Id.,</i> at 725 (\"The federal claim must have substance sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the court. . . . [A]ssuming substantiality of the federal issues, there is <i>power</i> in federal courts to hear the whole\").</p>\n<p>As we later noted, the decision allowing jurisdiction over pendent state claims in <i>Gibbs</i> did not mention, let alone come to grips with, the text of the jurisdictional statutes and the bedrock principle that federal courts have no jurisdiction without statutory authorization. <i>Finley</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 490 U. S. 545, 548 (1989). In <i>Finley,</i> we nonetheless reaffirmed and rationalized <i>Gibbs</i> and its progeny by inferring from it the interpretive principle that, in cases involving supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims between parties properly in federal court, the jurisdictional statutes should be read broadly, on the assumption that in this context Congress intended to authorize courts to exercise their full Article III power to dispose of an \"`entire action before the court [which] comprises but one constitutional \"case.\"'\" 490 U. S., at 549 (quoting <i>Gibbs, supra,</i> at 725).</p>\n<p>We have not, however, applied <i>Gibbs'</i> expansive interpretive approach to other aspects of the jurisdictional statutes. For instance, we have consistently interpreted \u00a7 1332 as requiring complete diversity: In a case with multiple plaintiffs and multiple defendants, the presence in the action of a single plaintiff from the same State as a single defendant deprives the district court of original diversity jurisdiction over the entire action. <i>Strawbridge</i> v. <i>Curtiss,</i> 3 Cranch 267 (1806); <i>Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co.</i> v. <i>Kroger,</i> 437 U. S. 365, 375 (1978). The complete diversity requirement is not mandated by the Constitution, <i>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co.</i> v. <i>Tashire,</i> 386 U. S. 523, 530-531 (1967), or by the plain text of \u00a7 1332(a). The Court, nonetheless, has adhered to the complete diversity rule in light of the purpose of the diversity requirement, which is to provide a federal forum for important disputes where state courts might favor, or be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*554</span> perceived as favoring, home-state litigants. The presence of parties from the same State on both sides of a case dispels this concern, eliminating a principal reason for conferring \u00a7 1332 jurisdiction over any of the claims in the action. See <i>Wisconsin Dept. of Corrections</i> v. <i>Schacht,</i> 524 U. S. 381, 389 (1998); <i>Newman-Green, Inc.</i> v. <i>Alfonzo-Larrain,</i> 490 U. S. 826, 829 (1989). The specific purpose of the complete diversity rule explains both why we have not adopted <i>Gibbs'</i> expansive interpretive approach to this aspect of the jurisdictional statute and why <i>Gibbs</i> does not undermine the complete diversity rule. In order for a federal court to invoke supplemental jurisdiction under <i>Gibbs,</i> it must first have original jurisdiction over at least one claim in the action. Incomplete diversity destroys original jurisdiction with respect to all claims, so there is nothing to which supplemental jurisdiction can adhere.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the diversity requirement, most of the other statutory prerequisites for federal jurisdiction, including the federal-question and amount-in-controversy requirements, can be analyzed claim by claim. True, it does not follow by necessity from this that a district court has authority to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over all claims provided there is original jurisdiction over just one. Before the enactment of \u00a7 1367, the Court declined in contexts other than the pendent-claim instance to follow <i>Gibbs'</i> expansive approach to interpretation of the jurisdictional statutes. The Court took a more restrictive view of the proper interpretation of these statutes in so-called pendent-party cases involving supplemental jurisdiction over claims involving additional parties\u0097plaintiffs or defendants\u0097where the district courts would lack original jurisdiction over claims by each of the parties standing alone.</p>\n<p>Thus, with respect to plaintiff-specific jurisdictional requirements, the Court held in <i>Clark</i> v. <i>Paul Gray, Inc.,</i> 306 U. S. 583 (1939), that every plaintiff must separately satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement. Though <i>Clark</i> was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*555</span> a federal-question case, at that time federal-question jurisdiction had an amount-in-controversy requirement analogous to the amount-in-controversy requirement for diversity cases. \"Proper practice,\" <i>Clark</i> held, \"requires that where each of several plaintiffs is bound to establish the jurisdictional amount with respect to his own claim, the suit should be dismissed as to those who fail to show that the requisite amount is involved.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 590. The Court reaffirmed this rule, in the context of a class action brought invoking \u00a7 1332(a) diversity jurisdiction, in <i>Zahn</i> v. <i>International Paper Co.,</i> 414 U. S. 291 (1973). It follows \"inescapably\" from <i>Clark,</i> the Court held in <i>Zahn,</i> that \"any plaintiff without the jurisdictional amount must be dismissed from the case, even though others allege jurisdictionally sufficient claims.\" 414 U. S., at 300.</p>\n<p>The Court took a similar approach with respect to supplemental jurisdiction over claims against additional defendants that fall outside the district courts' original jurisdiction. In <i>Aldinger</i> v. <i>Howard,</i> 427 U. S. 1 (1976), the plaintiff brought a Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983, action against county officials in District Court pursuant to the statutory grant of jurisdiction in 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1343(3) (1976 ed.). The plaintiff further alleged the court had supplemental jurisdiction over her related state-law claims against the county, even though the county was not suable under \u00a7 1983 and so was not subject to \u00a7 1343(3)'s original jurisdiction. The Court held that supplemental jurisdiction could not be exercised because Congress, in enacting \u00a7 1343(3), had declined (albeit implicitly) to extend federal jurisdiction over any party who could not be sued under the federal civil rights statutes. 427 U. S., at 16-19. \"Before it can be concluded that [supplemental] jurisdiction [over additional parties] exists,\" <i>Aldinger</i> held, \"a federal court must satisfy itself not only that Art[icle] III permits it, but that Congress in the statutes conferring jurisdiction has not expressly or by implication negated its existence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 18.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*556</span> In <i>Finley</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 490 U. S. 545 (1989), we confronted a similar issue in a different statutory context. The plaintiff in <i>Finley</i> brought a Federal Tort Claims Act negligence suit against the Federal Aviation Administration in District Court, which had original jurisdiction under \u00a7 1346(b). The plaintiff tried to add related claims against other defendants, invoking the District Court's supplemental jurisdiction over so-called pendent parties. We held that the District Court lacked a sufficient statutory basis for exercising supplemental jurisdiction over these claims. Relying primarily on <i>Zahn, Aldinger,</i> and <i>Kroger,</i> we held in <i>Finley</i> that \"a grant of jurisdiction over claims involving particular parties does not itself confer jurisdiction over additional claims by or against different parties.\" 490 U. S., at 556. While <i>Finley</i> did not \"limit or impair\" <i>Gibbs'</i> liberal approach to interpreting the jurisdictional statutes in the context of supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims involving the same parties, 490 U. S., at 556, <i>Finley</i> nevertheless declined to extend that interpretive assumption to claims involving additional parties. <i>Finley</i> held that in the context of parties, in contrast to claims, \"we will not assume that the full constitutional power has been congressionally authorized, and will not read jurisdictional statutes broadly.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 549.</p>\n<p>As the jurisdictional statutes existed in 1989, then, here is how matters stood: First, the diversity requirement in \u00a7 1332(a) required complete diversity; absent complete diversity, the district court lacked original jurisdiction over all of the claims in the action. <i>Strawbridge,</i> 3 Cranch, at 267-268; <i>Kroger,</i> 437 U. S., at 373-374. Second, if the district court had original jurisdiction over at least one claim, the jurisdictional statutes implicitly authorized supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims between the same parties arising out of the same Article III case or controversy. <i>Gibbs,</i> 383 U. S., at 725. Third, even when the district court had original <span class=\"star-pagination\">*557</span> jurisdiction over one or more claims between particular parties, the jurisdictional statutes did not authorize supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims involving other parties. <i>Clark,</i> 306 U. S., at 590; <i>Zahn, supra,</i> at 300-301; <i>Finley, supra,</i> at 556.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In <i>Finley</i> we emphasized that \"[w]hatever we say regarding the scope of jurisdiction conferred by a particular statute can of course be changed by Congress.\" 490 U. S., at 556. In 1990, Congress accepted the invitation. It passed the Judicial Improvements Act, 104 Stat. 5089, which enacted \u00a7 1367, the provision which controls these cases.</p>\n<p>Section 1367 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution. Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) In any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332 of this title, the district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19 of such rules, or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 24 of such rules, when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section 1332.\"</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*558</span> All parties to this litigation and all courts to consider the question agree that \u00a7 1367 overturned the result in <i>Finley.</i> There is no warrant, however, for assuming that \u00a7 1367 did no more than to overrule <i>Finley</i> and otherwise to codify the existing state of the law of supplemental jurisdiction. We must not give jurisdictional statutes a more expansive interpretation than their text warrants, 490 U. S., at 549, 556; but it is just as important not to adopt an artificial construction that is narrower than what the text provides. No sound canon of interpretation requires Congress to speak with extraordinary clarity in order to modify the rules of federal jurisdiction within appropriate constitutional bounds. Ordinary principles of statutory construction apply. In order to determine the scope of supplemental jurisdiction authorized by \u00a7 1367, then, we must examine the statute's text in light of context, structure, and related statutory provisions.</p>\n<p>Section 1367(a) is a broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction over other claims within the same case or controversy, as long as the action is one in which the district courts would have original jurisdiction. The last sentence of \u00a7 1367(a) makes it clear that the grant of supplemental jurisdiction extends to claims involving joinder or intervention of additional parties. The single question before us, therefore, is whether a diversity case in which the claims of some plaintiffs satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement, but the claims of other plaintiffs do not, presents a \"civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction.\" If the answer is yes, \u00a7 1367(a) confers supplemental jurisdiction over all claims, including those that do not independently satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement, if the claims are part of the same Article III case or controversy. If the answer is no, \u00a7 1367(a) is inapplicable and, in light of our holdings in <i>Clark</i> and <i>Zahn,</i> the district court has no statutory basis for exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the additional claims.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*559</span> We now conclude the answer must be yes. When the well-pleaded complaint contains at least one claim that satisfies the amount-in-controversy requirement, and there are no other relevant jurisdictional defects, the district court, beyond all question, has original jurisdiction over that claim. The presence of other claims in the complaint, over which the district court may lack original jurisdiction, is of no moment. If the court has original jurisdiction over a single claim in the complaint, it has original jurisdiction over a \"civil action\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1367(a), even if the civil action over which it has jurisdiction comprises fewer claims than were included in the complaint. Once the court determines it has original jurisdiction over the civil action, it can turn to the question whether it has a constitutional and statutory basis for exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the other claims in the action.</p>\n<p>Section 1367(a) commences with the direction that \u00a7\u00a7 1367(b) and (c), or other relevant statutes, may provide specific exceptions, but otherwise \u00a7 1367(a) is a broad jurisdictional grant, with no distinction drawn between pendent-claim and pendent-party cases. In fact, the last sentence of \u00a7 1367(a) makes clear that the provision grants supplemental jurisdiction over claims involving joinder or intervention of additional parties. The terms of \u00a7 1367 do not acknowledge any distinction between pendent jurisdiction and the doctrine of so-called ancillary jurisdiction. Though the doctrines of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction developed separately as a historical matter, the Court has recognized that the doctrines are \"two species of the same generic problem,\" <i>Kroger,</i> 437 U. S., at 370. Nothing in \u00a7 1367 indicates a congressional intent to recognize, preserve, or create some meaningful, substantive distinction between the jurisdictional categories we have historically labeled pendent and ancillary.</p>\n<p>If \u00a7 1367(a) were the sum total of the relevant statutory language, our holding would rest on that language alone. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*560</span> The statute, of course, instructs us to examine \u00a7 1367(b) to determine if any of its exceptions apply, so we proceed to that section. While \u00a7 1367(b) qualifies the broad rule of \u00a7 1367(a), it does not withdraw supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of the additional parties at issue here. The specific exceptions to \u00a7 1367(a) contained in \u00a7 1367(b), moreover, provide additional support for our conclusion that \u00a7 1367(a) confers supplemental jurisdiction over these claims. Section 1367(b), which applies only to diversity cases, withholds supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of plaintiffs proposed to be joined as indispensable parties under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19, or who seek to intervene pursuant to Rule 24. Nothing in the text of \u00a7 1367(b), however, withholds supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of plaintiffs permissively joined under Rule 20 (like the additional plaintiffs in No. 04-79) or certified as class-action members pursuant to Rule 23 (like the additional plaintiffs in No. 04-70). The natural, indeed the necessary, inference is that \u00a7 1367 confers supplemental jurisdiction over claims by Rule 20 and Rule 23 plaintiffs. This inference, at least with respect to Rule 20 plaintiffs, is strengthened by the fact that \u00a7 1367(b) explicitly excludes supplemental jurisdiction over claims against defendants joined under Rule 20.</p>\n<p>We cannot accept the view, urged by some of the parties, commentators, and Courts of Appeals, that a district court lacks original jurisdiction over a civil action unless the court has original jurisdiction over every claim in the complaint. As we understand this position, it requires assuming either that all claims in the complaint must stand or fall as a single, indivisible \"civil action\" as a matter of definitional necessity \u0097what we will refer to as the \"indivisibility theory\"\u0097or else that the inclusion of a claim or party falling outside the district court's original jurisdiction somehow contaminates every other claim in the complaint, depriving the court of original jurisdiction over any of these claims\u0097what we will refer to as the \"contamination theory.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*561</span> The indivisibility theory is easily dismissed, as it is inconsistent with the whole notion of supplemental jurisdiction. If a district court must have original jurisdiction over every claim in the complaint in order to have \"original jurisdiction\" over a \"civil action,\" then in <i>Gibbs</i> there was no civil action of which the district court could assume original jurisdiction under \u00a7 1331, and so no basis for exercising supplemental jurisdiction over any of the claims. The indivisibility theory is further belied by our practice\u0097in both federal-question and diversity cases\u0097of allowing federal courts to cure jurisdictional defects by dismissing the offending parties rather than dismissing the entire action. <i>Clark,</i> for example, makes clear that claims that are jurisdictionally defective as to amount in controversy do not destroy original jurisdiction over other claims. 306 U. S., at 590 (dismissing parties who failed to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement but retaining jurisdiction over the remaining party). If the presence of jurisdictionally problematic claims in the complaint meant the district court was without original jurisdiction over the single, indivisible civil action before it, then the district court would have to dismiss the whole action rather than particular parties.</p>\n<p>We also find it unconvincing to say that the definitional indivisibility theory applies in the context of diversity cases but not in the context of federal-question cases. The broad and general language of the statute does not permit this result. The contention is premised on the notion that the phrase \"original jurisdiction of all civil actions\" means different things in \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1332. It is implausible, however, to say that the identical phrase means one thing (original jurisdiction in all actions where at least one claim in the complaint meets the following requirements) in \u00a7 1331 and something else (original jurisdiction in all actions where every claim in the complaint meets the following requirements) in \u00a7 1332.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*562</span> The contamination theory, as we have noted, can make some sense in the special context of the complete diversity requirement because the presence of nondiverse parties on both sides of a lawsuit eliminates the justification for providing a federal forum. The theory, however, makes little sense with respect to the amount-in-controversy requirement, which is meant to ensure that a dispute is sufficiently important to warrant federal-court attention. The presence of a single nondiverse party may eliminate the fear of bias with respect to all claims, but the presence of a claim that falls short of the minimum amount in controversy does nothing to reduce the importance of the claims that do meet this requirement.</p>\n<p>It is fallacious to suppose, simply from the proposition that \u00a7 1332 imposes both the diversity requirement and the amount-in-controversy requirement, that the contamination theory germane to the former is also relevant to the latter. There is no inherent logical connection between the amount-in-controversy requirement and \u00a7 1332 diversity jurisdiction. After all, federal-question jurisdiction once had an amount-in-controversy requirement as well. If such a requirement were revived under \u00a7 1331, it is clear beyond peradventure that \u00a7 1367(a) provides supplemental jurisdiction over federal-question cases where some, but not all, of the federal-law claims involve a sufficient amount in controversy. In other words, \u00a7 1367(a) unambiguously overrules the holding and the result in <i>Clark.</i> If that is so, however, it would be quite extraordinary to say that \u00a7 1367 did not also overrule <i>Zahn,</i> a case that was premised in substantial part on the holding in <i>Clark.</i></p>\n<p>In addition to the theoretical difficulties with the argument that a district court has original jurisdiction over a civil action only if it has original jurisdiction over each individual claim in the complaint, we have already considered and rejected a virtually identical argument in the closely analogous context of removal jurisdiction. In <i>Chicago</i> v. <i>International</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*563</span> <i>College of Surgeons,</i> 522 U. S. 156 (1997), the plaintiff brought federal- and state-law claims in state court. The defendant removed to federal court. The plaintiff objected to removal, citing the text of the removal statute, \u00a7 1441(a). That statutory provision, which bears a striking similarity to the relevant portion of \u00a7 1367, authorizes removal of \"any civil action . . . of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction . . . .\" The <i>College of Surgeons</i> plaintiff urged that, because its state-law claims were not within the District Court's original jurisdiction, \u00a7 1441(a) did not authorize removal. We disagreed. The federal-law claims, we held, \"suffice to make the actions `civil actions' within the `original jurisdiction' of the district courts . . . . Nothing in the jurisdictional statutes suggests that the presence of related state law claims somehow alters the fact that [the plaintiff's] complaints, by virtue of their federal claims, were `civil actions' within the federal courts' `original jurisdiction.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 166. Once the case was removed, the District Court had original jurisdiction over the federal-law claims and supplemental jurisdiction under \u00a7 1367(a) over the state-law claims. <i>Id.,</i> at 165.</p>\n<p>The dissent in <i>College of Surgeons</i> argued that because the plaintiff sought on-the-record review of a local administrative agency decision, the review it sought was outside the scope of the District Court's jurisdiction. <i>Id.,</i> at 177 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.). We rejected both the suggestion that state-law claims involving administrative appeals are beyond the scope of \u00a7 1367 supplemental jurisdiction, <i>id.,</i> at 168-172 (opinion of the Court), and the claim that the administrative review posture of the case deprived the District Court of original jurisdiction over the federal-law claims in the case, <i>id.,</i> at 163-168. More importantly for present purposes, <i>College of Surgeons</i> stressed that a district court has original jurisdiction of a civil action for purposes of \u00a7 1441(a) as long as it has original jurisdiction over a subset of the claims constituting the action. Even the <i>College of Surgeons</i> dissent, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*564</span> which took issue with the Court's interpretation of \u00a7 1367, did not appear to contest this view of \u00a7 1441(a).</p>\n<p>Although <i>College of Surgeons</i> involved additional claims between the same parties, its interpretation of \u00a7 1441(a) applies equally to cases involving additional parties whose claims fall short of the jurisdictional amount. If we were to adopt the contrary view that the presence of additional parties means there is no \"civil action . . . of which the district courts . . . have original jurisdiction,\" those cases simply would not be removable. To our knowledge, no court has issued a reasoned opinion adopting this view of the removal statute. It is settled, of course, that absent complete diversity a case is not removable because the district court would lack original jurisdiction. <i>Caterpillar Inc.</i> v. <i>Lewis,</i> 519 U. S. 61, 73 (1996). This, however, is altogether consistent with our view of \u00a7 1441(a). A failure of complete diversity, unlike the failure of some claims to meet the requisite amount in controversy, contaminates every claim in the action.</p>\n<p>We also reject the argument, similar to the attempted distinction of <i>College of Surgeons</i> discussed above, that while the presence of additional claims over which the district court lacks jurisdiction does not mean the civil action is outside the purview of \u00a7 1367(a), the presence of additional parties does. The basis for this distinction is not altogether clear, and it is in considerable tension with statutory text. Section 1367(a) applies by its terms to any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, and the last sentence of \u00a7 1367(a) expressly contemplates that the court may have supplemental jurisdiction over additional parties. So it cannot be the case that the presence of those parties destroys the court's original jurisdiction, within the meaning of \u00a7 1367(a), over a civil action otherwise properly before it. Also, \u00a7 1367(b) expressly withholds supplemental jurisdiction in diversity cases over claims by plaintiffs joined as indispensable parties under Rule 19. If joinder of such <span class=\"star-pagination\">*565</span> parties were sufficient to deprive the district court of original jurisdiction over the civil action within the meaning of \u00a7 1367(a), this specific limitation on supplemental jurisdiction in \u00a7 1367(b) would be superfluous. The argument that the presence of additional parties removes the civil action from the scope of \u00a7 1367(a) also would mean that \u00a7 1367 left the <i>Finley</i> result undisturbed. <i>Finley,</i> after all, involved a Federal Tort Claims Act suit against a federal defendant and state-law claims against additional defendants not otherwise subject to federal jurisdiction. Yet all concede that one purpose of \u00a7 1367 was to change the result reached in <i>Finley.</i></p>\n<p>Finally, it is suggested that our interpretation of \u00a7 1367(a) creates an anomaly regarding the exceptions listed in \u00a7 1367(b): It is not immediately obvious why Congress would withhold supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs joined as parties \"needed for just adjudication\" under Rule 19 but would allow supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs permissively joined under Rule 20. The omission of Rule 20 plaintiffs from the list of exceptions in \u00a7 1367(b) may have been an \"unintentional drafting gap,\" <i>Meritcare,</i> 166 F. 3d, at 221, and n. 6. If that is the case, it is up to Congress rather than the courts to fix it. The omission may seem odd, but it is not absurd. An alternative explanation for the different treatment of Rules 19 and 20 is that Congress was concerned that extending supplemental jurisdiction to Rule 19 plaintiffs would allow circumvention of the complete diversity rule: A nondiverse plaintiff might be omitted intentionally from the original action, but joined later under Rule 19 as a necessary party. See <i>Stromberg Metal Works,</i> 77 F. 3d, at 932. The contamination theory described above, if applicable, means this ruse would fail, but Congress may have wanted to make assurance double sure. More generally, Congress may have concluded that federal jurisdiction is only appropriate if the district court would have original jurisdiction over the claims of all those plaintiffs who are so essential to the action that they could be joined under Rule 19.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*566</span> To the extent that the omission of Rule 20 plaintiffs from the list of \u00a7 1367(b) exceptions is anomalous, moreover, it is no more anomalous than the inclusion of Rule 19 plaintiffs in that list would be if the alternative view of \u00a7 1367(a) were to prevail. If the district court lacks original jurisdiction over a civil diversity action where any plaintiff's claims fail to comply with all the requirements of \u00a7 1332, there is no need for a special \u00a7 1367(b) exception for Rule 19 plaintiffs who do not meet these requirements. Though the omission of Rule 20 plaintiffs from \u00a7 1367(b) presents something of a puzzle on our view of the statute, the inclusion of Rule 19 plaintiffs in this section is at least as difficult to explain under the alternative view.</p>\n<p>And so we circle back to the original question. When the well-pleaded complaint in district court includes multiple claims, all part of the same case or controversy, and some, but not all, of the claims are within the court's original jurisdiction, does the court have before it \"any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction\"? It does. Under \u00a7 1367, the court has original jurisdiction over the civil action comprising the claims for which there is no jurisdictional defect. No other reading of \u00a7 1367 is plausible in light of the text and structure of the jurisdictional statute. Though the special nature and purpose of the diversity requirement mean that a single nondiverse party can contaminate every other claim in the lawsuit, the contamination does not occur with respect to jurisdictional defects that go only to the substantive importance of individual claims.</p>\n<p>It follows from this conclusion that the threshold requirement of \u00a7 1367(a) is satisfied in cases, like those now before us, where some, but not all, of the plaintiffs in a diversity action allege a sufficient amount in controversy. We hold that \u00a7 1367 by its plain text overruled <i>Clark</i> and <i>Zahn</i> and authorized supplemental jurisdiction over all claims by diverse parties arising out of the same Article III case or controversy, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*567</span> subject only to enumerated exceptions not applicable in the cases now before us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The proponents of the alternative view of \u00a7 1367 insist that the statute is at least ambiguous and that we should look to other interpretive tools, including the legislative history of \u00a7 1367, which supposedly demonstrate Congress did not intend \u00a7 1367 to overrule <i>Zahn.</i> We can reject this argument at the very outset simply because \u00a7 1367 is not ambiguous. For the reasons elaborated above, interpreting \u00a7 1367 to foreclose supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs in diversity cases who do not meet the minimum amount in controversy is inconsistent with the text, read in light of other statutory provisions and our established jurisprudence. Even if we were to stipulate, however, that the reading these proponents urge upon us is textually plausible, the legislative history cited to support it would not alter our view as to the best interpretation of \u00a7 1367.</p>\n<p>Those who urge that the legislative history refutes our interpretation rely primarily on the House Judiciary Committee Report on the Judicial Improvements Act. H. R. Rep. No. 101-734 (1990) (House Report or Report). This Report explained that \u00a7 1367 would \"authorize jurisdiction in a case like <i>Finley,</i> as well as essentially restore the pre-<i>Finley</i> understandings of the authorization for and limits on other forms of supplemental jurisdiction.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 28. The Report stated that \u00a7 1367(a) \"generally authorizes the district court to exercise jurisdiction over a supplemental claim whenever it forms part of the same constitutional case or controversy as the claim or claims that provide the basis of the district court's original jurisdiction,\" and in so doing codifies <i>Gibbs</i> and fills the statutory gap recognized in <i>Finley.</i> House Report, at 28-29, and n. 15. The Report then remarked that \u00a7 1367(b) \"is not intended to affect the jurisdictional requirements of [\u00a7 1332] in diversity-only class <span class=\"star-pagination\">*568</span> actions, as those requirements were interpreted prior to <i>Finley,</i>\" citing, without further elaboration, <i>Zahn</i> and <i>Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur</i> v. <i>Cauble,</i> 255 U. S. 356 (1921). House Report, at 29, and n. 17. The Report noted that the \"net effect\" of \u00a7 1367(b) was to implement the \"principal rationale\" of <i>Kroger,</i> House Report, at 29, and n. 16, effecting only \"one small change\" in pre-<i>Finley</i> practice with respect to diversity actions: \u00a7 1367(b) would exclude \"Rule 23(a) plaintiff-intervenors to the same extent as those sought to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19.\" House Report, at 29. (It is evident that the report here meant to refer to Rule 24, not Rule 23.)</p>\n<p>As we have repeatedly held, the authoritative statement is the statutory text, not the legislative history or any other extrinsic material. Extrinsic materials have a role in statutory interpretation only to the extent they shed a reliable light on the enacting Legislature's understanding of otherwise ambiguous terms. Not all extrinsic materials are reliable sources of insight into legislative understandings, however, and legislative history in particular is vulnerable to two serious criticisms. First, legislative history is itself often murky, ambiguous, and contradictory. Judicial investigation of legislative history has a tendency to become, to borrow Judge Leventhal's memorable phrase, an exercise in \"`looking over a crowd and picking out your friends.'\" See Wald, Some Observations on the Use of Legislative History in the 1981 Supreme Court Term, 68 Iowa L. Rev. 195, 214 (1983). Second, judicial reliance on legislative materials like committee reports, which are not themselves subject to the requirements of Article I, may give unrepresentative committee members\u0097or, worse yet, unelected staffers and lobbyists\u0097 both the power and the incentive to attempt strategic manipulations of legislative history to secure results they were unable to achieve through the statutory text. We need not comment here on whether these problems are sufficiently prevalent to render legislative history inherently unreliable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*569</span> in all circumstances, a point on which Members of this Court have disagreed. It is clear, however, that in this instance both criticisms are right on the mark.</p>\n<p>First of all, the legislative history of \u00a7 1367 is far murkier than selective quotation from the House Report would suggest. The text of \u00a7 1367 is based substantially on a draft proposal contained in a Federal Court Study Committee working paper, which was drafted by a Subcommittee chaired by Judge Posner. Report of the Subcommittee on the Role of the Federal Courts and Their Relationship to the States 567-568 (Mar. 12, 1990), reprinted in 1 Judicial Conference of the United States, Federal Courts Study Committee, Working Papers and Subcommittee Reports (July 1, 1990) (Subcommittee Working Paper). See also Judicial Conference of the United States, Report of the Federal Courts Study Committee 47-48 (Apr. 2, 1990) (Study Committee Report) (echoing, in brief summary form, the Subcommittee Working Paper proposal and noting that the Subcommittee Working Paper \"contains additional material on this subject\"); House Report, at 27 (\"[Section 1367] implements a recommendation of the Federal Courts Study Committee found on pages 47 and 48 of its Report\"). While the Subcommittee explained, in language echoed by the House Report, that its proposal \"basically restores the law as it existed prior to <i>Finley,</i>\" Subcommittee Working Paper, at 561, it observed in a footnote that its proposal would overrule <i>Zahn</i> and that this would be a good idea, Subcommittee Working Paper, at 561, n. 33. Although the Federal Courts Study Committee did not expressly adopt the Subcommittee's specific reference to <i>Zahn,</i> it neither explicitly disagreed with the Subcommittee's conclusion that this was the best reading of the proposed text nor substantially modified the proposal to avoid this result. Study Committee Report, at 47-48. Therefore, even if the House Report could fairly be read to reflect an understanding that the text of \u00a7 1367 did not overrule <i>Zahn,</i> the Subcommittee Working Paper on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*570</span> which \u00a7 1367 was based reflected the opposite understanding. The House Report is no more authoritative than the Subcommittee Working Paper. The utility of either can extend no further than the light it sheds on how the enacting Legislature understood the statutory text. Trying to figure out how to square the Subcommittee Working Paper's understanding with the House Report's understanding, or which is more reflective of the understanding of the enacting legislators, is a hopeless task.</p>\n<p>Second, the worst fears of critics who argue legislative history will be used to circumvent the Article I process were realized in this case. The telltale evidence is the statement, by three law professors who participated in drafting \u00a7 1367, see House Report, at 27, n. 13, that \u00a7 1367 \"on its face\" permits \"supplemental jurisdiction over claims of class members that do not satisfy section 1332's jurisdictional amount requirement, which would overrule <i>[Zahn].</i> [There is] a disclaimer of intent to accomplish this result in the legislative history. . . . It would have been better had the statute dealt explicitly with this problem, and the legislative history was an attempt to correct the oversight.\" Rowe, Burbank, &amp; Mengler, Compounding or Creating Confusion About Supplemental Jurisdiction? A Reply to Professor Freer, 40 Emory L. J. 943, 960, n. 90 (1991). The professors were frank to concede that if one refuses to consider the legislative history, one has no choice but to \"conclude that section 1367 has wiped <i>Zahn</i> off the books.\" <i>Ibid.</i> So there exists an acknowledgment, by parties who have detailed, specific knowledge of the statute and the drafting process, both that the plain text of \u00a7 1367 overruled <i>Zahn</i> and that language to the contrary in the House Report was a <i>post hoc</i> attempt to alter that result. One need not subscribe to the wholesale condemnation of legislative history to refuse to give any effect to such a deliberate effort to amend a statute through a committee report.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*571</span> In sum, even if we believed resort to legislative history were appropriate in these cases\u0097a point we do not concede\u0097we would not give significant weight to the House Report. The distinguished jurists who drafted the Subcommittee Working Paper, along with three of the participants in the drafting of \u00a7 1367, agree that this provision, on its face, overrules <i>Zahn.</i> This accords with the best reading of the statute's text, and nothing in the legislative history indicates directly and explicitly that Congress understood the phrase \"civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction\" to exclude cases in which some but not all of the diversity plaintiffs meet the amount-in-controversy requirement.</p>\n<p>No credence, moreover, can be given to the claim that, if Congress understood \u00a7 1367 to overrule <i>Zahn,</i> the proposal would have been more controversial. We have little sense whether any Member of Congress would have been particularly upset by this result. This is not a case where one can plausibly say that concerned legislators might not have realized the possible effect of the text they were adopting. Certainly, any competent legislative aide who studied the matter would have flagged this issue if it were a matter of importance to his or her boss, especially in light of the Subcommittee Working Paper. There are any number of reasons why legislators did not spend more time arguing over \u00a7 1367, none of which are relevant to our interpretation of what the words of the statute mean.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>Finally, we note that the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA), Pub. L. 109-2, 119 Stat. 4, enacted this year, has no bearing on our analysis of these cases. Subject to certain limitations, the CAFA confers federal diversity jurisdiction over class actions where the aggregate amount in controversy exceeds $5 million. It abrogates the rule against aggregating claims, a rule this Court recognized in <i>Ben-Hur</i> and reaffirmed in <i>Zahn.</i> The CAFA, however, is not retroactive, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*572</span> and the views of the 2005 Congress are not relevant to our interpretation of a text enacted by Congress in 1990. The CAFA, moreover, does not moot the significance of our interpretation of \u00a7 1367, as many proposed exercises of supplemental jurisdiction, even in the class-action context, might not fall within the CAFA's ambit. The CAFA, then, has no impact, one way or the other, on our interpretation of \u00a7 1367.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is affirmed. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE GINSBURG's carefully reasoned opinion, <i>post,</i> at 577 (dissenting opinion), demonstrates the error in the Court's rather ambitious reading of this opaque jurisdictional statute. She also has demonstrated that \"ambiguity\" is a term that may have different meanings for different judges, for the Court has made the remarkable declaration that its reading of the statute is so obviously correct\u0097and JUSTICE GINSBURG'S so obviously wrong\u0097that the text does not even qualify as \"ambiguous.\" See <i>ante,</i> at 567. Because ambiguity is apparently in the eye of the beholder, I remain convinced that it is unwise to treat the ambiguity <i>vel non</i> of a statute as determinative of whether legislative history is consulted. Indeed, I believe that we as judges are more, rather than less, constrained when we make ourselves accountable to <i>all</i> reliable evidence of legislative intent. See <i>Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc.</i> v. <i>Nigh,</i> 543 U. S. 50, 65-66, and n. 1 (2004) (Stevens, J., concurring).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*573</span> The legislative history of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1367 provides powerful confirmation of JUSTICE GINSBURG'S interpretation of that statute. It is helpful to consider in full the relevant portion of the House Report, which was also adopted by the Senate:</p>\n<blockquote>\"This section would authorize jurisdiction in a case like <i>Finley</i> [v. <i>United States,</i> 490 U. S. 545 (1989)], as well as essentially restore the pre-<i>Finley</i> understandings of the authorization for and limits on other forms of supplemental jurisdiction. In federal question cases, it broadly authorizes the district courts to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims, including claims involving the joinder of additional parties. In diversity cases, the district courts may exercise supplemental jurisdiction, except when doing so would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of the diversity statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Subsection 114(b) [\u00a7 1367(b)] prohibits a district court in a case over which it has jurisdiction founded solely on the general diversity provision, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1332, from exercising supplemental jurisdiction in specified circumstances. [Footnote 16: `The net effect of subsection (b) is to implement the principal rationale of <i>Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co.</i> v. <i>Kroger,</i> 437 U. S. 365 (1978)'.] In diversity-only actions the district courts may not hear plaintiffs' supplemental claims when exercising supplemental jurisdiction would encourage plaintiffs to evade the jurisdictional requirement of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1332 by the simple expedient of naming initially only those defendants whose joinder satisfies section 1332's requirements and later adding claims not within original federal jurisdiction against other defendants who have intervened or been joined on a supplemental basis. In accord with case law, the subsection <span class=\"star-pagination\">*574</span> also prohibits the joinder or intervention of persons or plaintiffs if adding them is inconsistent with section 1332's requirements. The section is not intended to affect the jurisdictional requirements of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1332 in diversity-only class actions, as those requirements were interpreted prior to Finley. [Footnote 17: `See <i>Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur</i> v. <i>Cauble,</i> 255 U. S. 356 (1921); <i>Zahn</i> v. <i>International Paper Co.,</i> 414 U. S. 291 (1973)'.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Subsection (b) makes one small change in pre-<i>Finley</i> practice. Anomalously, under current practice, the same party might intervene as of right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and take advantage of supplemental jurisdiction, but not come within supplemental jurisdiction if parties already in the action sought to effect the joinder under Rule 19. Subsection (b) would eliminate this anomaly, excluding Rule 23(a) plaintiff-intervenors to the same extent as those sought to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19.\" H. R. Rep. No. 101-734, pp. 28-29 (1990) (footnote omitted) (hereinafter House Report or Report).<sup>[1]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Not only does the House Report specifically say that \u00a7 1367 was not intended to upset <i>Zahn</i> v. <i>International Paper Co.,</i> 414 U. S. 291 (1973), but its entire explanation of the statute demonstrates that Congress had in mind a very specific and relatively modest task\u0097undoing this Court's 5-to-4 decision in <i>Finley</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 490 U. S. 545 (1989). In addition to overturning that unfortunate and much-criticized decision,<sup>[2]</sup> the statute, according to the Report, codifies and preserves \"the pre-<i>Finley</i> understandings of the authorization <span class=\"star-pagination\">*575</span> for and limits on other forms of supplemental jurisdiction,\" House Report, at 28, with the exception of making \"one small change in pre-<i>Finley</i> practice,\" <i>id.,</i> at 29, which is not relevant here.</p>\n<p>The sweeping purpose that the Court's decision imputes to Congress bears no resemblance to the House Report's description of the statute. But this does not seem to trouble the Court, for its decision today treats statutory interpretation as a pedantic exercise, divorced from any serious attempt at ascertaining congressional intent. Of course, there are situations in which we do not honor Congress' apparent intent unless that intent is made \"clear\" in the text of a statute\u0097in this way, we can be certain that Congress considered the issue and intended a disfavored outcome, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Landgraf</i> v. <i>USI Film Products,</i> 511 U. S. 244 (1994) (requiring clear statement for retroactive civil legislation). But that principle provides no basis for discounting the House Report, given that our cases have never recognized a presumption in <i>favor</i> of expansive diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>The Court's reasons for ignoring this virtual billboard of congressional intent are unpersuasive. That a subcommittee of the Federal Courts Study Committee believed that an earlier, substantially similar version of the statute overruled <i>Zahn,</i> see <i>ante,</i> at 569, only highlights the fact that the statute is ambiguous. What is determinative is that the House Report explicitly rejected that broad reading of the statutory text. Such a report has special significance as an indicator of legislative intent. In Congress, committee reports are normally considered the authoritative explication of a statute's text and purposes, and busy legislators and their assistants rely on that explication in casting their votes. Cf. <i>Garcia</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 469 U. S. 70, 76 (1984) (\"In surveying legislative history we have repeatedly stated that the authoritative source for finding the Legislature's intent lies in the Committee Reports on the bill, which `represen[t] the considered and collective understanding of those Congressmen <span class=\"star-pagination\">*576</span> involved in drafting and studying proposed legislation'\" (quoting <i>Zuber</i> v. <i>Allen,</i> 396 U. S. 168, 186 (1969); brackets in original)).</p>\n<p>The Court's second reason\u0097its comment on the three law professors who participated in drafting \u00a7 1367, see <i>ante,</i> at 570\u0097is similarly off the mark. In the law review article that the Court refers to, the professors were merely saying that the text of the statute was susceptible to an overly broad (and simplistic) reading, and that clarification in the House Report was therefore appropriate. See Rowe, Burbank, &amp; Mengler, Compounding or Creating Confusion About Supplemental Jurisdiction? A Reply to Professor Freer, 40 Emory L. J. 943, 960, n. 90 (1991).<sup>[3]</sup> Significantly, the reference to <i>Zahn</i> in the House Report does not at all appear to be tacked on or out of place; indeed, it is wholly consistent with the Report's broader explanation of Congress' goal of overruling <i>Finley</i> and preserving pre-<i>Finley</i> law. To suggest that these professors participated in a \"deliberate effort to amend a statute through a committee report,\" <i>ante,</i> at 570, reveals an unrealistic view of the legislative process, not to mention disrespect for three law professors who acted in the role of public servants. To be sure, legislative history can be manipulated. But, in the situation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*577</span> before us, there is little reason to fear that an unholy conspiracy of \"unrepresentative committee members,\" <i>ante,</i> at 568, law professors, and \"unelected staffers and lobbyists,\" <i>ibid.,</i> endeavored to torpedo Congress' attempt to overrule (without discussion) two longstanding features of this Court's diversity jurisprudence.</p>\n<p>After nearly 20 pages of complicated analysis, which explores subtle doctrinal nuances and coins various neologisms, the Court announces that \u00a7 1367 could not reasonably be read another way. See <i>ante,</i> at 567. That conclusion is difficult to accept. Given JUSTICE GINSBURG'S persuasive account of the statutory text and its jurisprudential backdrop, and given the uncommonly clear legislative history, I am confident that the majority's interpretation of \u00a7 1367 is mistaken. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE O'CONNOR, and JUSTICE BREYER join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>These cases present the question whether Congress, by enacting 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1367, overruled this Court's decisions in <i>Clark</i> v. <i>Paul Gray, Inc.,</i> 306 U. S. 583, 589 (1939) (reaffirming the holding of <i>Troy Bank</i> v. <i>G. A. Whitehead &amp; Co.,</i> 222 U. S. 39, 40 (1911)), and <i>Zahn</i> v. <i>International Paper Co.,</i> 414 U. S. 291 (1973). <i>Clark</i> held that, when federal-court jurisdiction is predicated on a specified amount in controversy, each plaintiff joined in the litigation must independently meet the jurisdictional amount requirement. <i>Zahn</i> confirmed that in class actions governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), \"[e]ach [class member] . . . must satisfy the jurisdictional amount, and any [class member] who does not must be dismissed from the case.\" 414 U. S., at 301.</p>\n<p>Section 1367, all agree, was designed to overturn this Court's decision in <i>Finley</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 490 U. S. 545 (1989). <i>Finley</i> concerned not diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction (28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1332), but original federal-court jurisdiction in cases arising under federal law (28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1331). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*578</span> The plaintiff in <i>Finley</i> sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1346(b), to recover for the death of her husband and children in an airplane crash. She alleged that the Federal Aviation Administration's negligence contributed to the fatal accident. She later amended her complaint to add state-law tort claims against two other defendants, a municipality and a utility company. 490 U. S., at 546-547. No independent basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction existed over the state-law claims. The plaintiff could not have brought her entire action in state court, because federal jurisdiction in FTCA actions is exclusive. \u00a7 1346(b). Hence, absent federal jurisdiction embracing the state-law claims, she would be obliged to pursue two discrete actions, one in federal court, the other in state court. This Court held, nevertheless, that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the \"pendent-party\" state-law claims. <i>Id.,</i> at 555-556. In so holding, the Court stressed that Congress held the control rein. <i>Id.,</i> at 547-549. Congress could reverse the result in <i>Finley,</i> and permit pendent jurisdiction over state-law claims against additional defendants, if it so chose. <i>Id.,</i> at 556. Congress did so in \u00a7 1367.</p>\n<p>What more \u00a7 1367 wrought is an issue on which courts of appeals have sharply divided. Compare <i>Stromberg Metal Works, Inc.</i> v. <i>Press Mechanical, Inc.,</i> 77 F. 3d 928, 930 (CA7 1996) (\u00a7 1367 \"supersedes <i>Clark</i> and allows pendent-party jurisdiction when the additional parties have claims worth less than [the jurisdictional minimum]\"), and <i>In re Abbott Labs.,</i> 51 F. 3d 524, 529 (CA5 1995) (\"[U]nder \u00a7 1367 a district court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over members of a class, although they did not meet the amount-in-controversy requirement, as did the class representatives.\"), with <i>Meritcare Inc.</i> v. <i>St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co.,</i> 166 F. 3d 214, 222 (CA3 1999) (\u00a7 1367 \"preserves the prohibition against aggregation outlined in <i>[Zahn</i> and <i>Clark]</i>\"), and <i>Leonhardt</i> v. <i>Western Sugar Co.,</i> 160 F. 3d 631, 641 (CA10 1998) (\u00a7 1367 does not alter \"the historical rules prohibiting aggregation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*579</span> of claims, including <i>Zahn</i>'s prohibition of such aggregation in diversity class actions\"). The Court today holds that \u00a7 1367, although prompted by <i>Finley,</i> a case in which original access to federal court was predicated on a federal question, notably enlarges federal diversity jurisdiction. The Court reads \u00a7 1367 to overrule <i>Clark</i> and <i>Zahn,</i> thereby allowing access to federal court by coplaintiffs or class members who do not meet the now in excess of $75,000 amount-in-controversy requirement, so long as at least one coplaintiff, or the named class representative, has a jurisdictionally sufficient claim. <i>Ante,</i> at 549.</p>\n<p>The Court adopts a plausibly broad reading of \u00a7 1367, a measure that is hardly a model of the careful drafter's art. There is another plausible reading, however, one less disruptive of our jurisprudence regarding supplemental jurisdiction. If one reads \u00a7 1367(a) to instruct, as the statute's text suggests, that the district court must first have \"original jurisdiction\" over a \"civil action\" before supplemental jurisdiction can attach, then <i>Clark</i> and <i>Zahn</i> are preserved, and supplemental jurisdiction does not open the way for joinder of plaintiffs, or inclusion of class members, who do not independently meet the amount-in-controversy requirement. For the reasons that follow, I conclude that this narrower construction is the better reading of \u00a7 1367.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Section 1367, captioned \"Supplemental jurisdiction,\" codifies court-recognized doctrines formerly labeled \"pendent\" and \"ancillary\" jurisdiction. Pendent jurisdiction involved the enlargement of federal-question litigation to include related state-law claims. Ancillary jurisdiction evolved primarily to protect defending parties, or others whose rights might be adversely affected if they could not air their claims in an ongoing federal-court action. Given jurisdiction over the principal action, federal courts entertained certain matters <span class=\"star-pagination\">*580</span> deemed ancillary regardless of the citizenship of the parties or the amount in controversy.</p>\n<p><i>Mine Workers</i> v. <i>Gibbs,</i> 383 U. S. 715 (1966), the leading pendent jurisdiction case, involved a claim against a union for wrongfully inducing the plaintiff's discharge. The plaintiff stated a federal claim under the Taft-Hartley Act, and an allied state-law claim of unlawful conspiracy to interfere with his employment contract. This Court upheld the joinder of federal and state claims. \"[T]here is <i>power</i> in federal courts to hear the whole,\" the Court said, when the state and federal claims \"derive from a common nucleus of operative fact\" and are so linked that the plaintiff \"would ordinarily be expected to try them all in one judicial proceeding.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 725.</p>\n<p><i>Gibbs</i> involved the linkage of federal and state claims against the same defendant. In <i>Finley</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 490 U. S. 545, the Court contained <i>Gibbs.</i> Without congressional authorization, the Court admonished, the pendent jurisdiction umbrella could not be stretched to cover the joinder of additional parties. <i>Gibbs</i> had departed from earlier decisions recognizing that \"jurisdiction [must] be explicitly conferred,\" the Court said. 490 U. S., at 556. <i>Aldinger</i> v. <i>Howard,</i> 427 U. S. 1 (1976), the Court observed, although resting \"on a much narrower basis,\" R. Fallon, D. Meltzer, &amp; D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 925 (5th ed. 2003) (hereinafter Hart &amp; Wechsler), had already signaled that \"the <i>Gibbs</i> approach would not be extended to the pendent-party field,\" <i>Finley,</i> 490 U. S., at 556. While the <i>Finley</i> Court did not \"limit or impair\" <i>Gibbs</i> itself, 490 U. S., at 556, for further development of pendent jurisdiction, the Court made it plain, the initiative would lie in Congress' domain, <i>id.,</i> at 555-556.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*581</span> Ancillary jurisdiction, which evolved as a more sprawling doctrine than pendent jurisdiction, was originally rooted in \"the notion that [when] federal jurisdiction in [a] principal suit effectively controls the property or fund under dispute, other claimants thereto should be allowed to intervene in order to protect their interests, without regard to jurisdiction.\" <i>Aldinger,</i> 427 U. S., at 11; see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Freeman</i> v. <i>Howe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87425\"><a href=\"/opinion/87425/freeman-v-howe/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span> (1861). In <i>Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co.</i> v. <i>Kroger,</i> 437 U. S. 365 (1978), the Court addressed the permissible scope of the doctrine in relation to the liberal provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for joinder of parties and claims.</p>\n<p><i>Kroger</i> commenced as a suit between a citizen of Iowa and a Nebraska corporation. When the Nebraska defendant impleaded an Iowa corporation as a third-party defendant under Rule 14(a), the plaintiff asserted state-law claims against the impleaded party. No independent basis of federal jurisdiction existed over the newly asserted claims, for both plaintiff and impleaded defendant were citizens of Iowa. 437 U. S., at 370. The Court held that the plaintiff could not draw in a co-citizen defendant in this manner. <i>Id.,</i> at 377. Federal courts, by the time of <i>Kroger,</i> were routinely exercising ancillary jurisdiction over compulsory counterclaims, impleader claims, cross-claims among defendants, and claims of parties who intervened \"of right.\" See <i>id.,</i> at 375, n. 18 (collecting cases). In <i>Kroger,</i> however,</p>\n<blockquote>\"the nonfederal claim . . . was asserted by the plaintiff, who voluntarily chose to bring suit upon a state-law claim in a federal court. By contrast, ancillary jurisdiction typically involve[d] claims by a defending party haled into court against his will, or by another person whose rights might be irretrievably lost unless he could <span class=\"star-pagination\">*582</span> assert them in an ongoing action in a federal court.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 376.</blockquote>\n<p>Having \"chosen the federal rather than the state forum,\" the Court said, the plaintiff had to \"accept its limitations.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>In sum, in federal-question cases before \u00a7 1367's enactment, the Court recognized pendent-claim jurisdiction, <i>Gibbs,</i> 383 U. S., at 725, but not pendent-party jurisdiction, <i>Finley,</i> 490 U. S., at 555-556. As to ancillary jurisdiction, the Court adhered to the limitation that in diversity cases, throughout the litigation, all plaintiffs must remain diverse from all defendants. See <i>Kroger,</i> 437 U. S., at 374.</p>\n<p>Although pendent jurisdiction and ancillary jurisdiction evolved discretely,<sup>[2]</sup> the Court has recognized that they are \"two species of the same generic problem: Under what circumstances may a federal court hear and decide a state-law claim arising between citizens of the same State?\" <i>Id.,</i> at 370. <i>Finley</i> regarded that question as one properly addressed to Congress. See 490 U. S., at 549, 556; 13 Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 3523, p. 127 (2d ed., Supp. 2005); Hart &amp; Wechsler 924-926.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Shortly before the Court decided <i>Finley,</i> Congress had established the Federal Courts Study Committee to take up issues relating to \"the federal courts' congestion, delay, expense, and expansion.\" Judicial Conference of the United States, Report of the Federal Courts Study Committee 3 (Apr. 2, 1990) (hereinafter Committee Report). The Committee's charge was to conduct a study addressing the \"crisis\" in federal courts caused by the \"rapidly growing\" caseload. <i>Id.,</i> at 6 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*583</span> Among recommendations, the Committee urged Congress to \"authorize federal courts to assert pendent jurisdiction over parties without an independent federal jurisdictional base.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 47. If adopted, this recommendation would overrule <i>Finley.</i> Earlier, a Subcommittee had recommended that Congress overrule both <i>Finley</i> and <i>Zahn.</i> Report of the Subcommittee on the Role of the Federal Courts and Their Relationship to the States 547, 561, n. 33 (Mar. 12, 1990), reprinted in 1 Judicial Conference of the United States, Federal Courts Study Committee, Working Papers and Subcommittee Reports (July 1, 1990) (hereinafter Subcommittee Report). In the Subcommittee's view, \"[f]rom a policy standpoint,\" <i>Zahn</i> \"ma[de] little sense.\" Subcommittee Report, at 561, n. 33.<sup>[3]</sup> The full Committee, however, urged only the overruling of <i>Finley</i> and did not adopt the recommendation to overrule <i>Zahn.</i> Committee Report, at 47-48.</p>\n<p>As a separate matter, a substantial majority of the Committee \"strongly recommend[ed]\" the elimination of diversity jurisdiction, save for \"complex multi-state litigation, interpleader, and suits involving aliens.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 38-39; accord Subcommittee Report, at 454-458. \"[N]o other step,\" the Committee's Report maintained, \"will do anywhere nearly as much to reduce federal caseload pressures and contain the growth of the federal judiciary.\" Committee Report, at 39.</p>\n<p>Congress responded by adopting, as part of the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 5089,<sup>[4]</sup> recommendations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*584</span> of the Federal Courts Study Committee ranked by the House Committee on the Judiciary as \"modest\" and \"noncontroversial.\" H. R. Rep. No. 101-734, pp. 15-16 (1990) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.); see also 136 Cong. Rec. 36288 (1990). Congress did not take up the Study Committee's immodest proposal to curtail diversity jurisdiction. It did, however, enact a supplemental jurisdiction statute, codified as 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1367.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Section 1367, by its terms, operates only in civil actions \"of which the district courts have original jurisdiction.\" The \"original jurisdiction\" relevant here is diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction, conferred by \u00a7 1332. The character of that jurisdiction is the essential backdrop for comprehension of \u00a7 1367.</p>\n<p>The Constitution broadly provides for federal-court jurisdiction in controversies \"between Citizens of different States.\" Art. III, \u00a7 2, cl. 1. This Court has read that provision to demand no more than \"minimal diversity,\" <i>i. e.,</i> so long as one party on the plaintiffs' side and one party on the defendants' side are of diverse citizenship, Congress may authorize federal courts to exercise diversity jurisdiction. See <i>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co.</i> v. <i>Tashire,</i> 386 U. S. 523, 530-531 (1967). Further, the Constitution includes no amount-in-controversy limitation on the exercise of federal jurisdiction. But from the start, Congress, as its measures have been construed by this Court, has limited federal-court exercise of diversity jurisdiction in two principal ways. First, unless Congress specifies otherwise, diversity must be \"complete,\" <i>i. e.,</i> all parties on plaintiffs' side must be diverse from all parties on defendants' side. <i>Strawbridge</i> v. <i>Curtiss,</i> 3 Cranch 267 (1806); see 13B Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 3605 (2d ed. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*585</span> 1984). Second, each plaintiff's stake must independently meet the amount-in-controversy specification: \"When two or more plaintiffs, having separate and distinct demands, unite for convenience and economy in a single suit, it is essential that the demand of each be of the requisite jurisdictional amount.\" <i>Troy Bank,</i> 222 U. S., at 40.</p>\n<p>The statute today governing federal-court exercise of diversity jurisdiction in the generality of cases, \u00a7 1332, like all its predecessors, incorporates both a diverse-citizenship requirement and an amount-in-controversy specification.<sup>[5]</sup> As to the latter, the statute reads: \"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction [in diversity-of-citizenship cases] where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum . . . of $75,000.\" \u00a7 1332(a). This Court has long held that, in determining whether the amount-in-controversy requirement has been satisfied, a single plaintiff may aggregate two or more claims against a single defendant, even if the claims are unrelated. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Edwards</i> v. <i>Bates County,</i> 163 U. S. 269, 273 (1896). But in multiparty cases, including class actions, we have unyieldingly adhered to the nonaggregation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*586</span> rule stated in <i>Troy Bank.</i> See <i>Clark,</i> 306 U. S., at 589 (reaffirming the \"familiar rule that when several plaintiffs assert separate and distinct demands in a single suit, the amount involved in each separate controversy must be of the requisite amount to be within the jurisdiction of the district court, and that those amounts cannot be added together to satisfy jurisdictional requirements\"); <i>Snyder</i> v. <i>Harris,</i> 394 U. S. 332, 339-340 (1969) (abandonment of the nonaggregation rule in class actions would undercut the congressional \"purpose . . . to check, to some degree, the rising caseload of the federal courts\").</p>\n<p>This Court most recently addressed \"[t]he meaning of [\u00a7 1332's] `matter in controversy' language\" in <i>Zahn,</i> 414 U. S., at 298. <i>Zahn,</i> like <i>Snyder</i> decided four years earlier, was a class action. In <i>Snyder,</i> no class member had a claim large enough to satisfy the jurisdictional amount. But in <i>Zahn,</i> the named plaintiffs had such claims. 414 U. S., at 292. Nevertheless, the Court declined to depart from its \"longstanding construction of the `matter in controversy' requirement of \u00a7 1332.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 301. The <i>Zahn</i> Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"<i>Snyder</i> invoked the well-established rule that each of several plaintiffs asserting separate and distinct claims must satisfy the jurisdictional-amount requirement if his claim is to survive a motion to dismiss. This rule plainly mandates not only that there may be no aggregation and that the entire case must be dismissed where none of the plaintiffs claims [meets the amount-in-controversy requirement] but also requires that any plaintiff without the jurisdictional amount must be dismissed from the case, even though others allege jurisdictionally sufficient claims.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 300.</blockquote>\n<p>The rule that each plaintiff must independently satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement, unless Congress expressly orders otherwise, was thus the solidly established <span class=\"star-pagination\">*587</span> reading of \u00a7 1332 when Congress enacted the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990, which added \u00a7 1367 to Title 28.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>These cases present the question whether Congress abrogated the nonaggregation rule long tied to \u00a7 1332 when it enacted \u00a7 1367. In answering that question, \"context [should provide] a crucial guide.\" <i>Rosario Ortega</i> v. <i>Star-Kist Foods, Inc.,</i> 370 F. 3d 124, 135 (CA1 2004). The Court should assume, as it ordinarily does, that Congress legislated against a background of law already in place and the historical development of that law. See <i>National Archives and Records Admin.</i> v. <i>Favish,</i> 541 U. S. 157, 169 (2004). Here, that background is the statutory grant of diversity jurisdiction, the amount-in-controversy condition that Congress, from the start, has tied to the grant, and the nonaggregation rule this Court has long applied to the determination of the \"matter in controversy.\"</p>\n<p>Section 1367(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution. Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The Court is unanimous in reading \u00a7 1367(a) to permit pendent-party jurisdiction in federal-question cases, and thus, to overrule <i>Finley.</i> The basic jurisdictional grant, \u00a7 1331, provides that \"[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*588</span> laws, or treaties of the United States.\" Since 1980, \u00a7 1331 has contained no amount-in-controversy requirement. See 94 Stat. 2369 (eliminating \u00a7 1331's amount-in-controversy requirement). Once there is a civil action presenting a qualifying claim arising under federal law, \u00a7 1331's sole requirement is met. District courts, we have held, may then adjudicate, additionally, state-law claims \"deriv[ing] from a common nucleus of operative fact.\" <i>Gibbs,</i> 383 U. S., at 725. Section 1367(a) enlarges that category to include not only state-law claims against the defendant named in the federal claim, but also \"[state-law] claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.\"<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court divides, however, on the impact of \u00a7 1367(a) on diversity cases controlled by \u00a7 1332. Under the majority's reading, \u00a7 1367(a) permits the joinder of related claims cut loose from the nonaggregation rule that has long attended actions under \u00a7 1332. Only the claims specified in \u00a7 1367(b)<sup>[7]</sup> would be excluded from \u00a7 1367(a)'s expansion of \u00a7 1332's grant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*589</span> of diversity jurisdiction. And because \u00a7 1367(b) contains no exception for joinder of plaintiffs under Rule 20 or class actions under Rule 23, the Court concludes, <i>Clark</i> and <i>Zahn</i> have been overruled.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court's reading is surely plausible, especially if one detaches \u00a7 1367(a) from its context and attempts no reconciliation with prior interpretations of \u00a7 1332's amount-incontroversy requirement. But \u00a7 1367(a)'s text, as the First Circuit held, can be read another way, one that would involve no rejection of <i>Clark</i> and <i>Zahn.</i></p>\n<p>As explained by the First Circuit in <i>Ortega,</i> and applied to class actions by the Tenth Circuit in <i>Leonhardt,</i> see <i>supra,</i> at 578-579, \u00a7 1367(a) addresses \"civil action[s] of which the district courts have original jurisdiction,\" a formulation that, in diversity cases, is sensibly read to incorporate the rules on joinder and aggregation tightly tied to \u00a7 1332 at the time of \u00a7 1367's enactment. On this reading, a complaint must first meet that \"original jurisdiction\" measurement. If it does not, no supplemental jurisdiction is authorized. If it does, \u00a7 1367(a) authorizes \"supplemental jurisdiction\" over related claims. In other words, \u00a7 1367(a) would preserve undiminished, as part and parcel of \u00a7 1332 \"original jurisdiction\" determinations, both the \"complete diversity\" rule and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*590</span> the decisions restricting aggregation to arrive at the amount in controversy.<sup>[9]</sup> Section 1367(b)'s office, then, would be \"to prevent the erosion of the complete diversity [and amount-in-controversy] requirement[s] that might otherwise result from an expansive application of what was once termed the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction.\" See Pfander, Supplemental Jurisdiction and Section 1367: The Case for a Sympathetic Textualism, 148 U. Pa. L. Rev. 109, 114 (1999); <i>infra,</i> at 593-594. In contrast to the Court's construction of \u00a7 1367, which draws a sharp line between the diversity and amount-in-controversy components of \u00a7 1332, see <i>ante,</i> at 554; <i>supra,</i> at 585, n. 5, the interpretation presented here does not sever the two jurisdictional requirements.</p>\n<p>The more restrained reading of \u00a7 1367 just outlined would yield affirmance of the First Circuit's judgment in <i>Ortega,</i> and reversal of the Eleventh Circuit's judgment in <i>Exxon.</i> It would not discard entirely, as the Court does, the judicially developed doctrines of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction as they existed when <i>Finley</i> was decided.<sup>[10]</sup> Instead, it would recognize \u00a7 1367 essentially as a codification of those doctrines, placing them under a single heading, but largely retaining their substance, with overriding <i>Finley</i> the only basic change: Supplemental jurisdiction, once the district court has original jurisdiction, would now include \"claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.\" \u00a7 1367(a).</p>\n<p>Pendent jurisdiction, as earlier explained, see <i>supra,</i> at 579-580, applied only in federal-question cases and allowed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*591</span> plaintiffs to attach nonfederal claims to their jurisdiction-qualifying claims. Ancillary jurisdiction applied primarily, although not exclusively, in diversity cases and \"typically involve[d] claims <i>by a defending party</i> haled into court against his will.\" <i>Kroger,</i> 437 U. S., at 376 (emphasis added); see also <i>id.,</i> at 375, n. 18; <i>supra,</i> at 581-582. As the First Circuit observed, neither doctrine permitted a plaintiff to circumvent the dual requirements of \u00a7 1332 (diversity of citizenship and amount in controversy) \"simply by joining her [jurisdictionally inadequate] claim in an action brought by [a] jurisdictionally competent diversity plaintiff.\" <i>Ortega,</i> 370 F. 3d, at 138.</p>\n<p>Not only would the reading I find persuasive \"alig[n] statutory supplemental jurisdiction with the judicially developed doctrines of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction,\" <i>ibid.,</i> it would also synchronize \u00a7 1367 with the removal statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1441. As the First Circuit carefully explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Section 1441, like \u00a7 1367, applies only if the `civil action' in question is one `of which the district courts . . . have original jurisdiction.' \u00a7 1441(a). Relying on that language, the Supreme Court has interpreted \u00a7 1441 to prohibit removal unless the entire action, as it stands at the time of removal, could have been filed in federal court in the first instance. <i>See, e. g., </i><i>Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc. v. Henson,</i> 537 U. S. 28, 33 (2002); <i>Okla. Tax Comm'n v. Graham,</i> 489 U. S. 838, 840 (1989) (per curiam). Section 1441 has thus been held to incorporate the well-pleaded complaint rule, <i>see City of </i><i>Chicago</i> [v. <i>International College of Surgeons,</i> 522 U. S. 156, 163 (1997)];<sup>[11]</sup> the complete diversity rule, <i>see </i><i>Caterpillar,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*592</span> <i>Inc. v. Lewis,</i> 519 U. S. 61, 73 (1996); and rules for calculating the amount in controversy, <i>see </i><i>St. Paul Mercury Indem. Co. v. Red Cab Co.,</i> 303 U. S. 283, 291-292 (1938).\" 370 F. 3d, at 138 (citations omitted and footnote added).</blockquote>\n<p>The less disruptive view I take of \u00a7 1367 also accounts for the omission of Rule 20 plaintiffs and Rule 23 class actions in \u00a7 1367(b)'s text. If one reads \u00a7 1367(a) as a plenary grant of supplemental jurisdiction to federal courts sitting in diversity, one would indeed look for exceptions in \u00a7 1367(b). Finding none for permissive joinder of parties or class actions, one would conclude that Congress effectively, even if unintentionally, overruled <i>Clark</i> and <i>Zahn.</i> But if one recognizes that the nonaggregation rule delineated in <i>Clark</i> and <i>Zahn</i> forms part of the determination whether \"original jurisdiction\" exists in a diversity case, see <i>supra,</i> at 590, then plaintiffs who do not meet the amount-in-controversy requirement would fail at the \u00a7 1367(a) threshold. Congress would have no reason to resort to a \u00a7 1367(b) exception to turn such plaintiffs away from federal court, given that their claims, from the start, would fall outside the court's \u00a7 1332 jurisdiction. See Pfander, <i>supra,</i> at 148.</p>\n<p>Nor does the more moderate reading assign different meanings to \"original jurisdiction\" in diversity and federal-question cases. See <i>ante,</i> at 561. As the First Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"`[O]riginal jurisdiction' in \u00a7 1367(a) has the same meaning in every case: [An] underlying statutory grant of original jurisdiction must be satisfied. What differs between <span class=\"star-pagination\">*593</span> federal question and diversity cases is not the meaning of `original jurisdiction' but rather the [discrete] requirements of sections 1331 and 1332. Under \u00a7 1331, the sole issue is whether a federal question appears on the face of the plaintiff's well-pleaded complaint; the [citizenship] of the parties and the amounts they stand to recover [do not bear on that determination]. Section 1332, by contrast, predicates original jurisdiction on the identity of the parties (<i>i. e.,</i> [their] complete diversity) and their [satisfaction of the amount-in-controversy specification]. [In short,] the `original jurisdiction' language in \u00a7 1367 operates differently in federal-question and diversity cases not because the meaning of that term varies, but because the [jurisdiction-granting] statutes are different.\" 370 F. 3d, at 139-140.</blockquote>\n<p>What is the utility of \u00a7 1367(b) under my reading of \u00a7 1367(a)? Section 1367(a) allows parties other than the plaintiff to assert <i>reactive</i> claims once entertained under the heading ancillary jurisdiction. See <i>supra,</i> at 581 (listing claims, including compulsory counterclaims and impleader claims, over which federal courts routinely exercised ancillary jurisdiction). As earlier observed, see <i>supra,</i> at 590-591, \u00a7 1367(b) stops plaintiffs from circumventing \u00a7 1332's jurisdictional requirements by using another's claim as a hook to add a claim that the plaintiff could not have brought in the first instance. <i>Kroger</i> is the paradigm case. See <i>supra,</i> at 581-582. There, the Court held that ancillary jurisdiction did not extend to a plaintiff's claim against a nondiverse party who had been impleaded by the defendant under Rule 14. Section 1367(b), then, is corroborative of \u00a7 1367(a)'s coverage of claims formerly called ancillary, but provides exceptions to ensure that accommodation of added claims would not fundamentally alter \"the jurisdictional requirements of section 1332.\" See Pfander, 148 U. Pa. L. Rev., at 135-137.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*594</span> While \u00a7 1367's enigmatic text<sup>[12]</sup> defies flawless interpretation, see <i>supra,</i> at 589, n. 8,<sup>[13]</sup> the precedent-preservative reading, I am persuaded, better accords with the historical and legal context of Congress' enactment of the supplemental jurisdiction statute, see <i>supra,</i> at 582-584, 587, and the established limits on pendent and ancillary jurisdiction, see <i>supra,</i> at 580-582. It does not attribute to Congress a jurisdictional enlargement broader than the one to which the legislators adverted, cf. <i>Finley,</i> 490 U. S., at 549, and it follows the sound counsel that \"close questions of [statutory] construction should be resolved in favor of continuity and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*595</span> against change,\" Shapiro, Continuity and Change in Statutory Interpretation, 67 N.

A danger is that the result of the effort to deal with all the foreseeables will be a statute too prolix and baroque for everyday use and application by practitioners and judges. Section 1367 reflects an effort to provide sufficient detail without overdoing it. The statute is concededly not perfect. What it accomplishes, however, is to change the direction taken by the Supreme Court in <i>Finley,</i> to provide basic guidance (in particular the legislative history's general approval of pre-<i>Finley</i> case law, which has treated some specific issues Professor Freer raises), and then to trust the federal courts under the changed direction to interpret the statute sensibly. . . .\" 40 Emory L.

S. 291, 301 (1973), the <i>Zahn</i> Court did not refer to <i>Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur</i> v. <i>Cauble,</i> 255 U. S. 356, 366 (1921), which established that in a class action, the citizenship of the named plaintiff is controlling. But see <i>Zahn,</i> 414 U.

S. C. \u00a7 1332, treating the diversity-of-citizenship requirement as essential, the amount-incontroversy requirement as more readily disposable. See <i>ante,</i> at 553, 562. Section 1332 itself, however, does not rank order the two requirements. What \"[o]rdinary principl[e] of statutory construction\" or \"sound canon of interpretation,\" <i>ante,</i> at 558, allows the Court to slice up \u00a7 1332 this way? In partial explanation, the Court asserts that amount in controversy can be analyzed claim by claim, but the diversity requirement cannot. See <i>ante,</i> at 554. It is not altogether clear why that should be so. The cure for improper joinder of a nondiverse party is the same as the cure for improper joinder of a plaintiff who does not satisfy the jurisdictional amount. In both cases, original jurisdiction can be preserved by dismissing the nonqualifying party. See <i>Caterpillar Inc.</i> v. <i>Lewis,</i> 519 U. S. 61, 64 (1996) (diversity); <i>Newman-Green, Inc.</i> v. <i>Alfonzo-Larrain,</i> 490 U. S. 826, 836-838 (1989) (same); <i>Zahn,</i> 414 U. S., at 295, 300 (amount in controversy); <i>Clark</i> v. <i>Paul Gray, Inc.,</i> 306 U. S. 583, 590 (1939) (same).</p>\n<p>[6]  The Court noted in <i>Zahn,</i> 414 U. S., at 302, n. 11, that when the exercise of \u00a7 1331 federal-question jurisdiction and \u00a7 1332 diversity jurisdiction were conditioned on the same jurisdictional-amount limitation, the same nonaggregation rule applied under both heads of federal jurisdiction. But cf. <i>ante,</i> at 562. The Court added, however, that \"Congress ha[d] exempted major areas of federal-question jurisdiction from any jurisdictional-amount requirements,\" thus diminishing the impact of \u00a7 1331's \"matter in controversy\" specification in cases arising under federal law. <i>Zahn,</i> 414 U. S., at 302, n. 11.</p>\n<p>[7]  Title 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1367(b) provides:\n</p>\n<p>\"In any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332 of this title, the district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19 of such rules, or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 24 of such rules, when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section 1332.\"</p>\n<p>[8]  Under the Court's construction of \u00a7 1367, see <i>ante,</i> at 560, 566-567, Beatriz Ortega's family members can remain in the action because their joinder is merely permissive, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 20. If, however, their presence was \"needed for just adjudication,\" Rule 19, their dismissal would be required. The inclusion of those who may join, and exclusion of those who should or must join, defies rational explanation, but cf. <i>ante,</i> at 565, and others adopting the interpretation the Court embraces have so acknowledged, see <i>Stromberg Metal Works, Inc.</i> v. <i>Press Mechanical, Inc.,</i> 77 F. 3d 928, 932 (CA7 1996) (recognizing the anomaly and inquiring: \"What sense can this make?\"); cf. 14B Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 3704, p. 168 (3d ed. 1998) (distinction between Rule 19 and Rule 20 \"seems incongruous, and serves no apparent public policy purpose\").</p>\n<p>[9]  On this reading of \u00a7 1367(a), it is immaterial that \u00a7 1367(b) \"does not withdraw supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of the additional parties at issue here.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 560. Because those claims would not come within \u00a7 1367(a) in the first place, Congress would have had no reason to list them in \u00a7 1367(b). See <i>infra,</i> at 592-593.</p>\n<p>[10]  The Court's opinion blends the two doctrines, according no significance to their discrete development. See <i>ante,</i> at 552-557.</p>\n<p>[11]  The point of the Court's extended discussion of <i>Chicago</i> v. <i>International College of Surgeons,</i> 522 U. S. 156 (1997), in the instant cases, see <i>ante,</i> at 562-564, slips from my grasp. There was no disagreement in that case, and there is none now, that 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1367(a) is properly read to authorize the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction in removed cases. <i>International College of Surgeons</i> was unusual in that the federal court there was asked to review a decision of a local administrative agency. Such review, it was unsuccessfully argued, was \"appellate\" in character, and therefore outside the ken of a court empowered to exercise \"original\" jurisdiction. Compare 522 U. S., at 166-168, with <i>id.,</i> at 176-177 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>[12]  The Court notes the passage this year of the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA), Pub. L. 109-2, 119 Stat. 4, <i>ante,</i> at 571-572, only to dismiss that legislation as irrelevant. Subject to several exceptions and qualifications, CAFA provides for federal-court adjudication of state-law-based class actions in which diversity is \"minimal\" (one plaintiff's diversity from one defendant suffices), and the \"matter in controversy\" is an aggregate amount in excess of $5,000,000. Significant here, CAFA's enlargement of federal-court diversity jurisdiction was accomplished, \"clearly and conspicuously,\" by amending \u00a7 1332. Cf. <i>Rosario Ortega</i> v. <i>Star-Kist Foods, Inc.,</i> 370 F. 3d 124, 142 (CA1 2004).</p>\n<p>[13]  If \u00a7 1367(a) itself renders unnecessary the listing of Rule 20 plaintiffs and Rule 23 class actions in \u00a7 1367(b), see <i>supra,</i> at 592, then it is similarly unnecessary to refer, as \u00a7 1367(b) does, to \"persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19.\" On one account, Congress bracketed such persons with persons \"seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 24\" to modify pre-\u00a7 1367 practice. Before enactment of \u00a7 1367, courts entertained, under the heading ancillary jurisdiction, claims of Rule 24(a) intervenors \"of right,\" see <i>Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co.</i> v. <i>Kroger,</i> 437 U. S. 365, 375, n. 18 (1978), but denied ancillary jurisdiction over claims of \"necessary\" Rule 19 plaintiffs, see 13 Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 3523, p. 127 (2d ed., Supp. 2005). Congress may have sought simply to underscore that those seeking to join as plaintiffs, whether under Rule 19 or Rule 24, should be treated alike, <i>i. e.,</i> denied joinder when \"inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section 1332.\" See 370 F. 3d, at 140, and n. 15 (internal quotation marks omitted); H. R. Rep., at 29 (\"Subsection (b) makes one small change in pre-<i>Finley</i> practice,\" <i>i. e.,</i> it eliminates the Rule 19/Rule 24 anomaly.).</p>\n<p>[14]  While the interpretation of \u00a7 1367 described in this opinion does not rely on the measure's legislative history, that history, as JUSTICE STEVENS has shown, see <i>ante,</i> at 573 (dissenting opinion), is corroborative of the statutory reading set out above.</p>\n\n</div>",
