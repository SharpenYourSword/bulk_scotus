We hold that, even assuming a court may withhold its man- date after the denial of certiorari in some cases, the Court of Appeals' decision to do so here was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In 1985, Gregory Thompson and Joanna McNamara abducted Brenda Blanton Lane from a store parking lot in Shelbyville, Tennessee. After forcing Lane to drive them to a remote location, Thompson stabbed her to death. Thompson offered no evidence during the guilt phase of trial and was convicted by a jury of first-degree murder.</p>\n<p>Thompson's defense attorneys concentrated their efforts on persuading the sentencing jury that Thompson's posi- tive qualities and capacity to adjust to prison life provided good reasons for not imposing the death penalty. Before trial, Thompson's counsel had explored the issue of his mental condition. The trial judge referred Thompson to a state-run mental health facility for a 30-day evaluation. The resulting report indicated that Thompson was compe- tent at the time of the offense and at the time of the ex- amination. The defense team retained their own expert, Dr. George Copple, a clinical psychologist. At sentencing Copple testified that Thompson was remorseful and still had the ability to work and contribute while in prison. Thompson presented the character testimony of a number of witnesses, including former high school teachers, his grandparents, and two siblings. Arlene Cajulao, Thomp- son's girlfriend while he was stationed with the Navy in Hawaii, also testified on his behalf. She claimed that Thompson's behavior became erratic after he suffered head injuries during an attack by three of his fellow ser- vicemen. In rebuttal the State called Dr. Glenn Watson, a clinical psychologist who led the pretrial evaluation of Thompson's competence. Watson testified that his exami- nation of Thompson revealed no significant mental illness.</p>\n<p>The jury sentenced Thompson to death. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct review. <i>State</i> v. <i>Thompson</i>, 768 S. W. 2d 239 (Tenn. 1989), cert. denied, 497 U. S. 1031 (1990).</p>\n<p>In his state postconviction petition, Thompson claimed his trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to conduct an adequate investigation into his mental health. Thomp- son argued that his earlier head injuries had diminished his mental capacity and that evidence of his condition should have been presented as mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of trial. Under Tennessee law, mental illness that impairs a defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law is a mitigating factor in capital sentencing. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a739-2-203(j)(8) (1982) (re- pealed); \u00a7XX-XX-XXX(j)(8) (Lexis 2003). The postconviction court denied relief following an evidentiary hearing, and the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. <i>Thompson</i> v. <i>State</i>, 958 S. W. 2d 156 (1997). The Tennes- see Supreme Court denied discretionary review.</p>\n<p>Thompson renewed his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim on federal habeas. Thompson's attorneys retained a psychologist, Dr. Faye Sultan, to assist with the proceed- ings. At this point, 13 years had passed since Thompson's conviction. Sultan examined and interviewed Thompson three times, questioned his family members, and conducted an extensive review of his legal, military, medical, and prison records, App. 12, before diagnosing him as suffering from schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, <i>id.,</i> at 20. She contended that Thompson's symptoms indicated he was \"suffering serious mental illness at the time of the 1985 offense for which he has been convicted and sentenced. This mental illness would have substantially impaired Mr. Thompson's ability to conform his conduct to the require- ments of the law.\" <i>Ibid</i>. Sultan prepared an expert report on Thompson's behalf and was also deposed by the State.</p>\n<p>In February 2000, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee granted the State's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the habeas petition. The court held that Thompson failed to show that the state court's resolution of his claim rested on an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent or on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in state court. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d). The District Court also stated that Thompson had not presented \"any significant probative evidence that [he] was suffering from a significant mental disease that should have been presented to the jury during the pun- ishment phase as mitigation.\" No. 4:98\u0097CV006 (ED Tenn., Feb. 17, 2000), App. to Pet. for Cert. 270. Sultan's deposi- tion and report, however, had apparently not been in- cluded in the District Court record.</p>\n<p>While Thompson's appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit was pending, he filed a motion in the District Court under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) request- ing that the court supplement the record with Sultan's expert report and deposition. Thompson's habeas counsel at the time explained that the failure to include the Sultan evidence in the summary judgment record was an over- sight. Thompson also asked the Court of Appeals to hold his case in abeyance pending a ruling from the District Court and attached the Sultan evidence in support of his motion.</p>\n<p>The District Court denied the Rule 60(b) motion as untimely, and the Court of Appeals denied Thompson's motion to hold his appeal in abeyance. On January 9, 2003, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's denial of habeas relief. 315 F. 3d 566. The lead opinion, authored by Judge Suhrheinrich, rea- soned that there was no ineffective assistance of counsel because Thompson's attorneys were aware of his head injuries and made appropriate inquiries into his mental fitness. <i>Id.,</i> at 589-592. In particular, Thompson's attor- neys had requested that the trial court order a competency evaluation. A team of experts at the Middle Tennessee Mental Health Institute, a state-run facility, found \"no mental illness, mental defect, or insanity.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 589. Dr. George Copple, the clinical psychologist retained by Thompson's attorneys, also \"found no evidence of mental illness.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Judge Suhrheinrich emphasized that none of the experts retained by Thompson since trial had of- fered an opinion on his mental condition at the time of the crime. <i>Id.,</i> at 589-592. The lead opinion contained a passing reference to Thompson's unsuccessful Rule 60(b) motion, but did not discuss the Sultan deposition or expert report in any detail. <i>Id.,</i> at 583, n. 13. Judge Moore con- curred in the result based on Thompson's failure to pre- sent \"evidence that his counsel knew or should have known either that Thompson was mentally ill or that his mental condition was deteriorating at the time of his trial or at the time of his crime.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 595.</p>\n<p>Thompson filed a petition for rehearing. The petition placed substantial emphasis on the Sultan evidence, quot- ing from both her deposition and expert report. The Court of Appeals denied the petition for rehearing and stayed the issuance of its mandate pending the disposition of Thompson's petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p>This Court denied certiorari on December 1, 2003. 540 U. S. 1051. The following day, Thompson filed a motion in the Court of Appeals seeking to extend the stay of man- date pending disposition of his petition for rehearing in this Court. The Court of Appeals granted the motion and \"ordered that the mandate be stayed to allow appellant time to file a petition for rehearing from the denial of the writ of certiorari, and thereafter until the Supreme Court disposes of the case.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 348. On Janu- ary 20, 2004, this Court denied Thompson's petition for rehearing. 540 U. S. 1158. A copy of the order was filed with the Court of Appeals on January 23, 2004. The Court of Appeals, however, did not issue its mandate.</p>\n<p>The State, under the apparent assumption that the federal habeas corpus proceedings had terminated, filed a motion before the Tennessee Supreme Court requesting that an execution date be set. The court scheduled Thompson's execution for August 19, 2004.</p>\n<p>From February to June 2004, there were proceedings in both state and federal courts related to Thompson's pre- sent competency to be executed under <i>Ford</i> v. <i>Wainwright</i>, 477 U. S. 399 (1986). The state courts, after considering Sultan's testimony (which was based in part on followup observations after her initial 1998 examination) as well as that of other experts, found Thompson competent to be executed. <i>Thompson</i> v. <i>State</i>, 134 S. W. 3d 168 (Tenn. 2004). Thompson's <i>Ford</i> claim was still pending before the Federal District Court when on June 23, 2004, some seven months after this Court denied certiorari, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an amended opinion in Thompson's initial federal habeas case. 373 F. 3d 688. The new decision vacated the District Court's judgment denying habeas relief and remanded the case for an evi- dentiary hearing on Thompson's ineffective-assistance-of- counsel claim. <i>Id.,</i> at 691-692. The Court of Appeals relied on its equitable powers to supplement the record on appeal with Dr. Sultan's 1999 deposition after finding that it was \"apparently negligently omitted\" and \"probative of Thompson's mental state at the time of the crime.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 691. The court also explained its authority to issue an amended opinion five months after this Court denied a petition for rehearing: \"[W]e rely on our inherent power to reconsider our opinion prior to the issuance of the man- date, which has not yet issued in this case.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 691- 692. Judge Suhrheinrich authored a lengthy separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, which explained that his chambers initiated the <i>sua sponte</i> reconsideration of the case. He agreed with the majority about the probative value of the Sultan deposition, refer- ring to the evidence as \"critical.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 733. Unlike the majority, however, Judge Suhrheinrich would have relied upon fraud on the court to justify the decision to expand the record and issue an amended opinion. <i>Id.,</i> at 725-726, 729-742. He found \"implausible\" the explanation offered by Thompson's habeas counsel for his failure to include the Sultan deposition in the District Court record, <i>id.,</i> at 742, and speculated that counsel \"planned to unveil Dr. Sultan's opinion on the eve of Thompson's execution,\" <i>id</i>., at 738, n. 21.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari. 543 U. S. ___ (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>At issue in this case is the scope of the Court of Appeals' authority to withhold the mandate pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41. As relevant, the Rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(b) When Issued. The court's mandate must issue</blockquote>\n<blockquote>7 calendar days after the time to file a petition for re- hearing expires, or 7 calendar days after entry of an order denying a timely petition for panel rehearing, petition for rehearing en banc, or motion for stay of mandate, whichever is later. The court may shorten or extend the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(c) Effective Date. The mandate is effective when issued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(d) Staying the Mandate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) On Petition for Rehearing or Motion. The timely filing of a petition for panel rehearing, petition for rehearing en banc, or motion for stay of mandate, stays the mandate until disposition of the petition or motion, unless the court orders otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) Pending Petition for Certiorari.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(A) A party may move to stay the mandate pending the filing of a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court. The motion must be served on all parties and must show that the certiorari petition would present a substantial question and that there is good cause for a stay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) The stay must not exceed 90 days, unless the period is extended for good cause or unless the party who obtained the stay files a petition for the writ and so notifies the circuit clerk in writing within the pe- riod of the stay. In that case, the stay continues until the Supreme Court's final disposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(D) The court of appeals must issue the mandate immediately when a copy of a Supreme Court order denying the petition for writ of certiorari is filed.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Tennessee argues that the Court of Appeals was re- quired to issue the mandate following this Court's denial of Thompson's petition for certiorari. The State's position rests on Rule 41(d)(2)(D), which states that \"[t]he court of appeals must issue the mandate immediately when a copy of a Supreme Court order denying the petition for writ of certiorari is filed.\" This provision, the State points out, admits of no exceptions, so the mandate should have issued on the date that a copy of this Court's order deny- ing certiorari was filed with the Court of Appeals, <i>i.e.,</i> December 8, 2003.</p>\n<p>The State further contends that because the mandate should have issued in December 2003, the Court of Ap- peals' amended opinion was in essence a recall of the mandate. If this view is correct, the Court of Appeals' decision to revisit its earlier opinion must satisfy the standard established by <i>Calderon</i> v. <i>Thompson,</i> 523 U. S. 538 (1998). <i>Calderon</i> held that \"where a federal court of appeals <i>sua sponte</i> recalls its mandate to revisit the merits of an earlier decision denying habeas corpus relief to a state prisoner, the court abuses its discretion unless it acts to avoid a miscarriage of justice as defined by our habeas corpus jurisprudence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 558. See also <i>Schlup</i> v. <i>Delo,</i> 513 U. S. 298 (1995); <i>Sawyer</i> v. <i>Whitley,</i> 505 U. S. 333 (1992).</p>\n<p>Thompson counters by arguing that Rule 41(d)(2)(D) is determinative only when the court of appeals enters a stay of the mandate to allow the Supreme Court to dispose of a petition for certiorari. The provision, Thompson says, does not affect the court of appeals' broad discretion to enter a stay for other reasons. He relies on Rule 41(b), which provides the court of appeals may \"shorten or extend the time\" in which to issue the mandate. Because the author- ity vested by Rule 41(b) is not limited to the period before a petition for certiorari is denied, he argues that the Court of Appeals had the authority to stay its mandate following this Court's denial of certiorari and rehearing. Although the Court of Appeals failed to issue an order staying the mandate after we denied rehearing, Thompson asserts that the court exercised its Rule 41(b) powers by simply failing to issue it.</p>\n<p>To resolve this case, we need not adopt either party's interpretation of Rule 41. Instead, we hold that\u0097 assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> both that the Rule authorizes a stay of the mandate following the denial of certiorari and also that a court may stay the mandate without entering an order\u0097here the Court of Appeals abused its discretion in doing so.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>We find an abuse of discretion for the following reasons.</p>\n<p>Prominent among our concerns is the length of time between this Court's denial of certiorari and the Court of Appeals' issuance of its amended opinion. We denied Thompson's petition for certiorari in December 2003 and his petition for rehearing one month later. From this last denial, however, the Court of Appeals delayed issuing its mandate for over five months, releasing its amended opinion in June.</p>\n<p>The consequence of delay for the State's criminal justice system was compounded by the Court of Appeals' failure to issue an order or otherwise give notice to the parties that the court was reconsidering its earlier opinion. The Court of Appeals had issued two earlier orders staying its mandate. The first order stayed the mandate pending disposition of Thompson's petition for certiorari. The second order extended the stay to allow Thompson time to file a petition for rehearing with this Court and \"thereaf- ter until the Supreme Court disposes of the case.\" So by the express terms of the second order the mandate was not to be stayed after this Court acted; and when we denied rehearing on January 20, 2004, the Court of Appeals' second stay dissolved by operation of law. Tennessee, acting in reliance on the Court of Appeals' earlier orders and our denial of certiorari and rehearing, could assume that the mandate would\u0097indeed must\u0097issue. While it might have been prudent for the State to verify that the mandate had issued, it is understandable that it pro- ceeded to schedule an execution date. Thompson, after all, had not sought an additional stay of the mandate, and the Court of Appeals had given no indication that it might be revisiting its earlier decision.</p>\n<p>This latter point is important. It is an open question whether a court may exercise its Rule 41(b) authority to extend the time for the mandate to issue through mere inaction. Even assuming, however, that a court could effect a stay for a short period of time by withholding the mandate, a delay of five months is different in kind. \"Basic to the operation of the judicial system is the princi- ple that a court speaks through its judgments and orders.\" <i>Murdaugh Volkswagen, Inc.</i> v. <i>First National Bank of</i> <i>South Carolina</i>, 741 F. 2d 41, 44 (CA4 1984). Without a formal docket entry neither the parties nor this Court had, or have, any way to know whether the court had stayed the mandate or simply made a clerical mistake. Cf. <i>Bal-</i> <i>lard</i> v. <i>Commissioner</i>, 544 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 17). The dissent claims \"the failure to notify the parties was likely due to a simple clerical error\" on the part of the Clerk's office. <i>Post,</i> at 12-13 (opinion of BREYER, J.). The record lends no support to this speculation. The dissent also fails to explain why it is willing to apply a \"presump- tion of regularity\" to the panel's actions but not to the Clerk's. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals could have spared the parties and the state judicial system considerable time and resources if it had notified them that it was reviewing its original panel decision. After we denied Thompson's petition for rehearing, Tennessee scheduled his execution date. This, in turn, led to various proceedings in state and federal court to determine Thompson's present competency to be executed. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Thompson</i> v. <i>State</i>, 134 S. W. 3d 168 (Tenn. 2004). All of these steps were taken in reliance on the mistaken impression that Thompson's first federal habeas case was final. The State had begun to \"invok[e] its entire legal and moral authority in support of executing its judgment.\" <i>Calderon</i> v. <i>Thompson,</i> 523 U. S., at 556- 557.</p>\n<p>The parties' assumption that Thompson's habeas pro- ceedings were complete was all the more reasonable be- cause the Court of Appeals' delay in issuing its mandate took place after we had denied certiorari. As a practical matter, a decision by this Court denying discretionary review usually signals the end of litigation. While Rule 41(b) may authorize a court to stay the mandate after certiorari is denied, the circumstances where such a stay would be warranted are rare. See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>First Gibraltar</i> <i>Bank, FSB</i> v. <i>Morales</i>, 42 F. 3d 895 (CA5 1995); <i>Alphin</i> v. <i>Henson</i>, 552 F. 2d 1033 (CA4 1977). In the typical case, where the stay of mandate is entered solely to allow this Court time to consider a petition for certiorari, Rule 41(d)(2)(D) provides the default: \"The court of appeals must issue the mandate immediately when a copy of a Supreme Court order denying the petition for writ of certiorari is filed.\"</p>\n<p>By providing a mechanism for correcting errors in the courts of appeals before Supreme Court review is re- quested, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure ensure that litigation following the denial of certiorari will be infrequent. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 40(a) (\"Unless the time is shortened or extended by order or local rule, a petition for panel rehearing may be filed within 14 days after entry of judgment\"). See also Fed. Rules App. Proc. 35 (rehearing en banc), 40 (panel rehearing).</p>\n<p>Indeed, in this case Thompson's petition for rehearing and suggestion for rehearing en banc pressed the same arguments that eventually were adopted by the Court of Appeals in its amended opinion. The Sultan evidence, first presented to the Court of Appeals as an attachment to Thompson's motion to hold his appeal in abeyance, was quoted extensively in the petition for rehearing to the Court of Appeals. Pet. for Rehearing and Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc in No. 2:00-5516 (CA6), pp. 12-20, 28-31. After the request for rehearing was denied, the State could have assumed with good reason that the Court of Appeals was not impressed by Thompson's arguments based on the Sultan evidence. The court's opportunity to consider these arguments at the rehearing stage is yet another factor supporting our determination that the decision to withhold the mandate was in error. Cf. <i>Calderon</i> v. <i>Thompson, supra,</i> at 551-553 (questioning whether a \"mishandled law clerk transition\" and the \"failure of another judge to notice the action proposed by the original panel\" would justify recalling the mandate in a nonhabeas case).</p>\n<p>The dissent's explanation of how the Sultan evidence was overlooked is inaccurate in several respects. For example, the statements that the \"Sultan documents were not in the initial record on appeal,\" <i>post,</i> at 9, and that \"the panel previously had not seen these documents\" before the rehearing stage, <i>id.,</i> at 9, convey the wrong impression. Although the Sultan evidence was not part of the District Court's summary judgment record, the docu- ments were included in the certified record on appeal as attachments to Thompson's Rule 60(b) motion. Record 133; Docket Entry 4/5/02 in No. 98\u0097CV\u00976 (ED Tenn.); Docket Entry 4/10/02 in No. 00-5516 (CA6). The dissent also argues the petition for rehearing did not adequately bring the Sultan evidence to the attention of the Court of Appeals. <i>Post,</i> at 9-10, 13-14. This is simply untrue. The original panel opinion, which did not discuss the Sultan evidence in any detail, emphasized that Thompson had failed to produce any evidence that he was mentally ill at the time of his offense. 315 F. 3d, at 590; <i>id.,</i> at 595-596 (Moore, J., concurring). The petition for rehearing attacked this conclusion in no uncertain terms and placed the Sultan evidence front and center. Here, for example, is an excerpt from the petition's table of contents:</p>\n<blockquote>\"II. THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN THE RECORD OF THOMPSON'S MENTAL ILLESS AT THE TIME OF THE CRIME IS WRONG</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"A. Thompson Has Set Forth Above The Record Facts Demonstrating His Mental Illness At The Time of The Crime</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"B. The Majority Overlooks The Facts And Expert Opinion Set Forth In Dr. Sultan's Report and Deposi- tion.\" Pet. for Rehearing and Suggestion for Rehear- ing En Banc in No. 2:00-5516 (CA6), p. ii.</blockquote>\n<p>See also <i>id.,</i> at 1 (mentioning the Sultan evidence in thesecond paragraph of the statement in support of panel rehearing). The rehearing petition did not explain why Sultan's deposition and expert report had been omitted from the summary judgment record but that is beside the point. The petition acknowledged that the Sultan evi- dence was first presented to the District Court as an at- tachment to the Rule 60(b) motion, <i>id.,</i> at 29, and gave the Sultan evidence a prominent and explicit mention in the table of contents. It is difficult to see how Thompson's counsel could have been clearer in telling the Court of Appeals that it was wrong. The dissent's treatment of this issue assumes that judges forget even the basic details of a capital case only one month after issuing a 38-page opin- ion and that judges cannot be relied upon to read past the first page of a petition for rehearing. The problem is that the dissent cannot have it both ways: If the Sultan evi- dence is as crucial as the dissent claims, it would not easily have been overlooked by the Court of Appeals at the rehearing stage.</p>\n<p>Our review of the Sultan deposition reinforces our con- clusion that the Court of Appeals abused its discretion by withholding the mandate. Had the Sultan deposition and report been fully considered in the federal habeas proceed- ings, it no doubt would have been relevant to the District Court's analysis. Based on the Sultan deposition Thomp- son could have argued he suffered from mental illness at the time of his crime that would have been a mitigating factor under Tennessee law and that his trial attorneys were constitutionally ineffective for failing to conduct an adequate investigation into his mental health.</p>\n<p>Relevant though the Sultan evidence may be, however, it is not of such a character as to warrant the Court of Appeals' extraordinary departure from standard appellate procedures. There are ample grounds to conclude the evidence was unlikely to have altered the District Court's resolution of Thompson's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. Sultan examined Thompson for the first time on August 20, 1998, App. 37, some 13 years after Thompson's crime and conviction. She relied on the deterioration in Thompson's present mental health\u0097something that obvi- ously was not observable at the time of trial\u0097as evidence of his condition in 1985. (Indeed, there was a marked decline in his condition during the 6-month period be- tween Sultan's first two visits. <i>Id.,</i> at 51-58.) Sultan's findings regarding Thompson's condition in 1985 are contradicted by the testimony of two experts who exam- ined him at the time of trial, Dr. Watson and Dr. Copple. Watson performed a battery of tests at the Middle Tennes- see Mental Health Institute, where Thompson was re- ferred by the trial court for an examination, and concluded that Thompson \" '[did] not appear to be suffering from any complicated mental disorder which would impair his capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of the alleged offenses, or which would impair his capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.'\" 19 Tr. 164. Indeed, Watson presented substantial evidence supporting his conclusion that Thompson was malingering for mental illness. <i>Id.,</i> at 151-152; 20 <i>id.,</i> at 153-160. For example, Thompson claimed he could not read despite a B average in high school and one year's college credit. 19 <i>id.,</i> at 137; 20 <i>id.,</i> at 151. Thompson's test scores also indicated that he was attempting to fake schizophrenia. 20 <i>id.,</i> at 153- 154. Copple, the psychologist retained by Thompson's defense team, agreed with Watson that Thompson was not suffering from mental illness. 19 <i>id.,</i> at 58. Had the Sultan deposition been included in the District Court record, Thompson still would have faced an uphill battle to obtaining federal habeas relief. He would have had to argue that his trial attorneys should have continued to investigate his mental health even after both Watson and Copple had opined that there was nothing to uncover.</p>\n<p>Sultan's testimony does not negate Thompson's respon- sibility for committing the underlying offense, but it does bear upon an argument that Thompson's attorneys could have presented at sentencing. Sultan's ultimate conclu- sion\u0097that Thompson's mental illness substantially im- paired his ability to conform his conduct to the require- ments of the law\u0097is couched in the language of a mitigating factor under Tennessee law. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a739-2-203(j)(8) (1982). See also \u00a7XX-XX-XXX(j)(8) (Lexis 2003). Thompson's trial attorneys, however, chose not to pursue a mitigation strategy based on mental illness, stressing instead character evidence from family and friends and expert testimony that he had the capacity to adjust to prison. <i>Thompson</i> v. <i>State</i>, 958 S. W. 2d, at 164- 165. This strategic calculation, while ultimately unsuc- cessful, was based on a reasonable investigation into Thompson's background. Sultan relied on three witnesses in preparing her report: Thompson's grandmother, sister, and ex-girlfriend. These witnesses not only were inter- viewed by the defense attorneys; they testified at sentenc- ing. Consultation with these witnesses, when combined with the opinions of Watson and Copple, provided an adequate basis for Thompson's attorneys to conclude that focusing on Thompson's mental health was not the best strategy. As the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals noted, \"Because two experts did not detect brain damage, counsel cannot be faulted for discarding a strategy that could not be supported by a medical opinion.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 165.</p>\n<p>Without a single citation to the record, the dissent sug- gests that Thompson's attorneys failed to conduct ade- quate interviews of the defense witnesses on whom Sultan relied in her report. <i>Post,</i> at 14-15. Most of the informa- tion on Thompson's childhood was provided to Sultan by Nora Jean Wharton, Thompson's older sister. App. 16-18. Setting aside the fact that Thompson did not argue in state court that his counsel's interview of Wharton was inadequate, <i>Thompson</i> v. <i>State</i>, 958 S. W. 2d, at 160-169, Thompson's attorneys cannot be faulted for failing to elicit from her any details on Thompson's difficult home life. After all, Wharton testified at trial that Thompson's child- hood was \"poor,\" but \"very happy.\" 18 Tr. 3. The dissent also implies that the experts who examined Thompson lacked information necessary to reach an accurate as- sessment. The record refutes this assertion. In conduct- ing his examination, Watson had access to Thompson's social history and military records. 19 <i>id.,</i> at 149; 20 <i>id.,</i> at 186 (Exh. 102, pp. 11, 27-28). Watson was also aware of the prior head injuries as well as Thompson's claim that he heard voices. 19 <i>id.,</i> at 152; 20 <i>id.,</i> at 154-155. Never- theless, Watson, whose evaluation was contemporaneous with the trial, found no evidence that Thompson was mentally ill at the time of the crime. Watson's report was unequivocal on this point:</p>\n<blockquote>\" 'Mr. Thompson's speech and communication were coherent, rational, organized, relevant, and devoid of circumstantiality, tangentiality, looseness of associa- tions, paranoid ideation, ideas of reference, delusions, and other indicators of a thought disorder. His affect was appropriate to his thought content, and he exhib- ited no flight of ideas, manic, depressed, or bizarre behaviors, and his speech was not pressured nor rapid. He exhibited none of the signs of an affective illness. His judgment and insight are rather poor. Psychological testing revealed him to be functioning in the average range intellectually, to exhibit no signs of organicity or brain damage on the Bender-Gestalt Test and the Bender Interference Procedure. Person- ality profiles revealed no evidence of a psychosis, but indicated malingering in the mental illness direction. (For example, the schizophrenic score was at T 120, while clinical observations revealed no evidence of a thought disorder.) Mr. Thompson's memory for recent and remote events appeared unimpaired.'\" 20 <i>id.,</i> at 159-160.</blockquote>\n<p>Sultan's testimony provides some support for the argu- ment that the strategy of emphasizing Thompson's posi- tive attributes was a mistake in light of Thompson's dete- riorated condition 13 years after the trial. This evidence, however, would not come close to satisfying the miscar- riage of justice standard under <i>Calderon</i> had the Court of Appeals recalled the mandate. Neither, in our view, did this evidence justify the Court of Appeals' decision to withhold the mandate without notice to the parties, which in turn led the State to proceed for five months on the mistaken assumption that the federal habeas proceedings had terminated. The dissent suggests that failing to take account of the Sultan evidence would result in a \"miscar- riage of justice,\" <i>post,</i> at 1-2, 16, but the dissent uses that phrase in a way that is inconsistent with our precedents. In <i>Sawyer</i> v. <i>Whitley,</i> 505 U. S., at 545-547, this Court held that additional mitigating evidence could not meet the miscarriage of justice standard. Only evidence that affects a defendant's eligibility for the death penalty\u0097which the Sultan evidence is not\u0097can support a miscarriage of justice claim in the capital sentencing context. <i>Id.,</i> at 547; <i>Calderon,</i> 523 U. S., at 559-560.</p>\n<p>One last consideration informs our review of the Court of Appeals' actions. In <i>Calderon</i>, we held that federalism concerns, arising from the unique character of federal habeas review of state-court judgments, and the policies embodied in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Pen- alty Act of 1996 required an additional presumption against recalling the mandate. This case also arises from federal habeas corpus review of a state conviction. While the State's reliance interest is not as strong in a case where, unlike <i>Calderon</i>, the mandate has not issued, the finality and comity concerns that animated <i>Calderon</i> are implicated here. Here a dedicated judge discovered what he believed to have been an error, and we are respectful of the Court of Appeals' willingness to correct a decision that it perceived to have been mistaken. A court's discretion under Rule 41 must be exercised, however, in a way that is consistent with the \" 'State's interest in the finality of convictions that have survived direct review within the state court system.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 555 (quoting <i>Brecht</i> v. <i>Abra-</i> <i>hamson,</i> 507 U. S. 619, 635 (1993)). Tennessee expended considerable time and resources in seeking to enforce a capital sentence rendered 20 years ago, a sentence that reflects the judgment of the citizens of Tennessee that Thompson's crimes merit the ultimate punishment. By withholding the mandate for months\u0097based on evidence that supports only an arguable constitutional claim\u0097while the State prepared to carry out Thompson's sentence, the Court of Appeals did not accord the appropriate level of respect to that judgment. See <i>Calderon</i> v. <i>Thompson, su-</i> <i>pra,</i> at 554-557.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals may have been influenced by Sultan's unsettling account of Thompson's condition dur- ing one of her visits. She described Thompson as being in \"terrible psychological condition,\" \"physically filthy,\" and \"highly agitated.\" App. 51. This testimony raised ques- tions about Thompson's deteriorating mental health and perhaps his competence to be executed, but these concerns were properly addressed in separate proceedings. Based on the most recent state-court decision, which rejected the argument that Thompson is not competent to be executed, it appears that his condition has improved. <i>Thompson</i> v. <i>State</i>, 134 S. W. 3d, at 184-185. Proceedings on this issue were underway in the District Court when the Court of Appeals issued its second opinion. If those proceedings resume, the District Court will have an opportunity to address these matters again and in light of the current evidence.</p>\n<p>Taken together these considerations convince us that the Court of Appeals abused any discretion Rule 41 ar- guably granted it to stay its mandate, without entering a formal order, after this Court had denied certiorari. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for Sixth Circuit is re- versed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE SOUTER, and JUSTICE GINSBURG join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>This capital case arises out of unusual circumstances\u0097 circumstances of a kind that I have not previously experi- enced in the 25 years I have served on the federal bench. After an appellate court writes and releases an opinion, but before it issues its mandate, the writing judge, through happenstance, comes across a document that (he reasonably believes) shows not only that the court's initial decision is wrong but that the decision will lead to a seri- ous miscarriage of justice. What is the judge to do?</p>\n<p>What the judge did here was to spend time\u0097hundreds of hours (while a petition for certiorari was pending before this Court and during the five months following our denial of the petition for rehearing)\u0097reviewing the contents of the vast record with its many affidavits, reports, tran- scripts, and other documents accumulated in the course of numerous state and federal proceedings during the pre- ceding 20 years. The judge ultimately concluded that his initial instinct about the document was correct. The document was critically important. It could affect the outcome of what is, and has always been, the major issue in the case. To consider the case without reference to it could mean a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p>The judge consequently wrote a lengthy opinion (almost 30,000 words) explaining what had happened. The other members of the panel did not agree with everything in that opinion, but they did agree that their initial decision must be vacated.</p>\n<p>The Court commendably describes what occurred as follows: A \"dedicated judge discovered what he believed to have been an error, and we are respectful of the Court of Appeals' willingness to correct a decision that it perceived to have been mistaken.\" <i>Ante</i>, at 18. The Court, however, does not decide this case in a manner consistent with that observation. A somewhat more comprehensive account of the nature of the \"error\"\u0097of the matter at stake, of the importance of the document, of the mystery of its late appearance, of the potential for a miscarriage of justice\u0097 should help make apparent the difficult circumstance the panel believed it faced. It will also explain why there was no \"abuse\" of discretion in the panel's effort to \"correct a decision that it perceived to have been mistaken.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Judge Suhrheinrich, the panel member who investi- gated the record, is an experienced federal judge, serving since 1984 as a federal trial court judge and since 1990 as a federal appellate judge. He wrote a lengthy account of the circumstances present here. To understand this case, one must read that full account and then compare it with the Court's truncated version. I provide a rough summary of the matter based upon my own reading of his opinion. 373 F. 3d 688, 692-742 (CA6 2004).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The panel's initial decision, issued on January 9, 2003, focused upon an issue often raised when federal habeas courts review state proceedings in a capital case, namely, the effectiveness of counsel at the original trial. 315 F. 3d 566, 587-594 (CA6 2003). See <i>Strickland</i> v. <i>Washington</i>, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). In this instance, the federal ineffec- tive-assistance claim was that state trial counsel had not sufficiently investigated the background of the defendant, Gregory Thompson. Thompson claimed that an adequate investigation would have shown, to the satisfaction of testifying experts, that he suffered from episodes of schizophrenia at the time of the crime. The schizophre- nia\u0097though episodic\u0097would have proved a mitigating circumstance at the penalty phase. 373 F. 3d, at 697-698, and n. 4.</p>\n<p>Thompson's trial took place in a Tennessee state court, where he was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. His state-appointed counsel put on no defense at trial. At sentencing, however, counsel sought to show that Thompson was schizophrenic. State forensic psychologists examined Thompson and concluded that Thompson, probably \"malingering,\" did not show genuine and signifi- cant symptoms of schizophrenia at that time and was not mentally ill. A clinical psychologist hired by Thompson's counsel examined Thompson for eight hours and reached approximately the same conclusion: he said that Thomp- son was not <i>then</i> mentally ill. <i>Id</i>., at 692, 694-695.</p>\n<p>Thompson raised the issue of his mental condition in state postconviction proceedings, which he initiated in 1990. His expert witness, Dr. Gillian Blair, testified (with much supportive material) that Thompson was by that time clearly displaying serious schizophrenic symptoms\u0097 voice illusions, attempts at physical self-mutilation, and the like. Indeed, the State conceded that he was under a regime of major antipsychotic medication. But Dr. Blair said that she could not determine whether Thompson had been similarly afflicted (<i>i.e.</i>, suffering from episodes of schizophrenia) at the time of the crime without a thorough background investigation\u0097funds for which the state court declined to make available. The state court then ruled in the State's favor. <i>Id</i>., at 694-695.</p>\n<p>Thompson filed a habeas petition in Federal District Court about eight months after the state court's denial of postconviction relief became final. As I said above, see <i>supra</i>, at 3, he claimed ineffective assistance of counsel. The Federal District Court appointed counsel, an assistant federal public defender. Counsel then obtained the ser- vices of two experts, Dr. Barry Crown and Dr. Faye Sul- tan. Both examined Thompson, and the latter, Dr. Sultan, conducted the more thorough background investigation that Dr. Blair had earlier sought. The State, after depos- ing Dr. Sultan, moved for summary judgment. 373 F. 3d, at 696, 700-704, 711.</p>\n<p>The District Court granted that motion on the ground that \"Thompson has not provided this Court with anything other than factually unsupported allegations that he was incompetent at the time he committed the crime,\" nor \"has Thompson provided this Court with any significant proba- tive evidence that [he] was suffering from a significant mental disease that should have been presented to the jury during the punishment phase as mitigation evidence.\" <i>Id</i>., at 712-713 (quoting District Court's memorandum opinion (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>Thompson (now with a new public defender as counsel) appealed the District Court's grant of summary judgment in the State's favor. (A little over a year later, while the appeal was still pending, Thompson's new counsel, appar- ently having discovered that Dr. Sultan's deposition and report had not been included in the record before the District Court, filed a motion in that court for relief from judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), seeking to supplement the record with those documents. Counsel also filed a motion in the appellate court, with the Sultan deposition attached, requesting that the appeal be held in abeyance while the District Court considered the Rule 60(b) motion. Both motions were denied, and Thompson's counsel did not take an appeal from the Dis- trict Court's denial of the Rule 60(b) motion.) 373 F. 3d, at 714-715, and n. 10, 724-725.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals reviewed the District Court's grant of summary judgment. In doing so, the appellate panel examined the record before that court. It noted that Thompson's federal habeas counsel had hired two experts (Crown and Sultan), and had told the court (in an offer of proof) that they would provide evidence that Thompson suffered from mental illness <i>at the time of the crime</i>. But the appellate panel found that neither expert had done so. Indeed, said the panel, Thompson had \"never submitted to any court <i>any</i> proof that he suffered from severe mental illness at the time of the crime.\" 315 F. 3d, at 590 (em- phasis altered). Though Thompson's several attorneys had made the same allegation for many years in several different courts (said the panel), \"at each opportunity, counsel fail[ed] to secure an answer to the critical issue of whether Thompson was mentally ill at the time of the crime.\" <i>Ibid</i>. That fact, concluded the panel (over a dis- sent), was fatal to Thompson's basic ineffective-assistance- of-counsel claim. Obviously \"trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to discover something that does not appear to exist.\" <i>Ibid.;</i> see also <i>id</i>., at 595 (Moore, J., concurring in result) (\"Thompson has presented no evidence that his [trial] counsel knew or should have known either that Thompson was mentally ill or that his mental condition was deteriorating at the time of his trial or at the time of his crime\"). The dissenting judge thought Thompson had made out an ineffective-assistance claim by showing that his trial counsel had relied on an inadequate expert, that is, an expert without the necessary qualifica- tions to counter the State's experts' conclusions. <i>Id</i>., at 599-605 (opinion of Clay, J.).</p>\n<p>The appeals court issued its opinion on January 9, 2003. Thompson's appointed federal appeals counsel filed a rehearing petition, which the court denied on March 10, 2003. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 346 (Order in No. 00-5516 (CA6)). Thompson's counsel then sought Supreme Court review. This Court denied review (and rehearing) about one year later. 540 U. S. 1051 (2003) (denying certiorari); 540 U. S. 1158 (2004) (denying rehearing).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals, following ordinary appellate-court practice, withheld issuance of its mandate while the case was under review here, namely during calendar year 2003. During that time and in the months that followed, some- thing unusual happened. Judge Suhrheinrich realized that the panel, in reaching its decision, seemed to have overlooked documents provided by Dr. Sultan that likely were relevant. In September 2003, the appellate court called for the entire certified record. Upon reviewing that record, Judge Suhrheinrich found Dr. Sultan's deposition and accompanying report. 373 F. 3d, at 692-693; App. to Pet. for Cert. 347-348; see also Appendix, <i>infra</i>.</p>\n<p>The Sultan documents filled the evidentiary gap that underlay the District Court's and the appellate panel's determinations. These documents made clear that Dr. Sultan had investigated Thompson's background in depth and that in her (well-supported) opinion, Thompson <i>had</i> suffered from serious episodic bouts of schizophrenia <i>at</i> <i>the time the crime was committed</i>. Clearly the documents contained evidence supporting Thompson's claim regard- ing his mental state at the time of the offense. Why had the District Court denied the existence of <i>any</i> such evi- dence? Why had Judge Suhrheinrich, and the other mem- bers of the panel (and the State, which took Dr. Sultan's deposition) done the same?</p>\n<p>Judge Suhrheinrich then drafted an opinion that sought to answer three questions:</p>\n<p>Question One: Do these documents actually provide strong evidence that Thompson was schizophrenic (and seriously so) at the time of the crime?</p>\n<p>Question Two: If so, given the many previous opportuni- ties that Thompson has had to raise the issue of his men- tal health, to what extent would these documents be likely to matter in respect to the legal question raised in Thomp- son's federal proceedings, <i>i.e.</i>, would they likely lead a federal habeas court to hold that Thompson's trial counsel was ineffective for failing to undertake a background investigation akin to that performed by Dr. Sultan?</p>\n<p>Question Three: How did these documents previously escape our attention? 1</p>\n<p>The panel answered the first question\u0097regarding the importance of the documents\u0097unanimously. Sultan's report and deposition were critically important. As Judge Suhrheinrich's opinion explains, these documents detail Thompson's horrendous childhood, his family history of mental illness, his self-destructive schizophrenic behavior (including auditory hallucinations) as a child, his mood swings and bizarre behavior as a young adult, and a wors- ening of that behavior after a serious beating to his head that he suffered while in the Navy. For example, Dr. Sultan's examination of Thompson and her interviews with Thompson's family members and others revealed that as a child Thompson would repeatedly bang his head against the wall to \"knock the Devil out\" after his grand- mother yelled at him, \"You have the Devil in you.\" 373 F. 3d, at 716 (internal quotation marks omitted). These documents explain how Thompson, as a young adult, would talk to himself and scream and cry for no apparent reason. They suggest that he had bouts of paranoia.</p>\n<p>The documents provide strong support for the conclu- sion that Thompson suffered from episodes of schizophre- nia at the time of the offense. And they thereby offer significant support for the conclusion that, had earlier testifying experts had this information, they could have countered the State's experts' conclusion that Thompson was malingering at the time of trial. Thus, the Sultan materials seriously undermined the foundation of the State's position in respect to Thompson's mental condition.</p>\n<p>The Sultan materials also revealed that trial counsel failed to discover other mitigating evidence of importance. Interviews with family members revealed repeated inci- dents of violence in the family, including an episode in which, as a young boy, Thompson witnessed his father brutally beat and rape his mother. His grandmother, with whom Thompson and his siblings lived after their mother died, subjected them to abuse and neglect. She would forget to feed the children, leaving them to steal money from under her bed to buy food. These and other circum- stances are detailed in sections of the Sultan report and deposition reproduced in the Appendix, <i>infra</i>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>The panel also responded unanimously and affirma- tively to the second question: Would federal-court access to the Sultan documents likely have made a significant difference in respect to the federal legal question at issue in Thompson's habeas petition, namely, the failure of Thompson's trial counsel to investigate his background? Trial counsel had had important indications that some- thing was wrong. Indeed, counsel himself had sought an evaluation of Thompson's mental condition. He also was aware of Thompson's violent behavior in the military, and knew that Thompson had said he had had auditory hallu- cinations all his life. He was aware, too, of the changes in Thompson's behavior. Should counsel not then have investigated further?</p>\n<p>The Sultan documents make clear that, had he done so, he would have had a strong answer to the State's experts. Thus the documents were relevant to the outcome of the federal habeas proceedings. The Federal District Court based its grant of summary judgment on the premise that there was <i>no</i> evidence supporting Thompson's claim. The documents showed that precisely such evidence was then available.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3</h2>\n<p>The panel (while disagreeing about how to allocate blame) agreed in part about the answer to the third ques- tion: how these documents previously had escaped the panel's attention. The judges agreed that the Sultan documents were not in the initial record on appeal. The panel's original opinion, while mentioning both Dr. Sultan and Dr. Crown, assumed that neither expert had ad- dressed Thompson's mental condition at the time of the crime. 315 F. 3d, at 583, n. 13 (\"Sultan's affidavit does not discuss Thompson's mental state <i>at the time of the offense</i>\" (emphasis added)); <i>ibid</i>. (explaining that Thompson filed a Rule 60(b) motion to supplement the record with Dr. Sultan's report, but not mentioning that the report ad- dressed Thompson's mental condition at the time of the offense); see also <i>supra,</i> at 5.</p>\n<p>How had the panel overlooked the copies of the Sultan deposition attached to (1) the rehearing petition and (2) the (Rule 60(b)-related) motion to hold the appeal in abey- ance? As for the rehearing petition, the reason could well lie in the petition's (incorrect) suggestion that the panel had already considered the appended document as part of the original record. See Pet. for Rehearing and Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc in No. 2:00-5516 (CA6), p. 1 (\"A majority of this panel overlooked other proof in the record, including but not limited to, the expert opinion of Dr. Faye E. Sultan\"); see also <i>id</i>., at 28-32. While the petition explains the importance of the documents, it does not explain the circumstances, namely, that the panel previ- ously had not seen these documents. Instead, it gives the impression that counsel was simply reemphasizing a matter the panel had already considered. To that extent, the petition reduced the likelihood that the panel would make the connection it later made and fatally weakened its argument for <i>re-</i>hearing.</p>\n<p>As for the motion to hold the appeal in abeyance, the panel's failure to recognize the significance of the ap- pended Sultan materials is also understandable. The motion gives the impression that the appellate court would have been able to handle any problem arising from the exclusion of these materials in an appeal taken from the District Court's Rule 60(b) decision. The appellate court, however, never had any such opportunity because counsel did not appeal the District Court's denial of the Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Once the panel understood the significance of the Sultan report, it had to decide what to do. An appellate court exists to correct legal errors made in the trial court. What legal error had the District Court committed? The appeal concerned its grant of summary judgment in the State's favor. The District Court made that decision on the basis of the record before it, and that record apparently lacked the relevant documents. How then could an appeals court say that the District Court was wrong to grant the sum- mary judgment motion?</p>\n<p>The panel answered this question by <i>not</i> holding that the District Court had erred. Finding that the Sultan documents had been \"apparently negligently omitted\" from the record, it exercised its equitable powers to sup- plement the record with the deposition. 373 F. 3d, at 691. It also found that, since the State itself had helped to create that document (because the State had taken Sul- tan's deposition), the District Court's reconsideration of the matter would not unfairly prejudice the State. And it noted that this case is a death case. Then, relying on its \"inherent power to reconsider\" an opinion \"prior to the issuance of the mandate,\" the court issued a new opinion, vacating the District Court's grant of summary judgment to the State and remanding the case to the District Court for further proceedings on the matter. <i>Ibid</i>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The question before us is not whether we, as judges, would have come to the same conclusions as did the panel of the Court of Appeals. It is whether the three members of the appellate panel abused their discretion in reconsid- ering the matter and, after agreeing unanimously that they would have reached a different result had they con- sidered the overlooked evidence, vacating the District Court's judgment and remanding the case.</p>\n<p>The Court concludes that the panel's reconsideration of the matter and decision to vacate the District Court's judgment amounted to an \"abuse of discretion.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1. It therefore reverses the panel's unanimous interlocutory judgment remanding a capital case to the District Court for an evidentiary hearing. The Court lists five reasons why the Court of Appeals \"abused its discretion.\" None of these reasons, whether taken separately or considered together, stands up to examination.</p>\n<p><i>Reason One. During the 5-month period after this Court denied rehearing of Thompson's certiorari petition, during which time the Court of Appeals was reconsidering the matter, it gave \"no indication that it might be revisiting its earlier decision.\" Had it \"notified\" the parties, the court \"could have spared the parties and the state judicial system considerable time and resources.\" Ante</i>, at 10.</p>\n<p>If this consideration favors the Court's conclusion, it does so to a very modest degree. For one thing, the Fed- eral Rules themselves neither set an unchangeable dead- line for issuance of a mandate nor require notice when the court enlarges the time for issuance. Compare Fed. Rule App. Proc. 41(b) (2005) (\"The court may shorten or extend the time\"), with Rule 41(b) (1968) (mandate \"shall\" issue \"unless the time is shortened or extended <i>by order</i>\" (em- phasis added)). The Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 41 expressly contemplate that the parties will themselves check the docket to determine whether the mandate has issued. See Advisory Committee's 1998 Note on subd. (c) of Rule 41 (\"[T]he parties can easily calculate the antici- pated date of issuance and verify issuance of the man- date[;] the entry of the order on the docket alerts the parties to that fact\"). And Sixth Circuit Rules require the Circuit Clerk to provide all parties with copies of the mandate. See Internal Operating Procedure 41(a) (CA6 2005) (\"Copies of the mandate are distributed to all parties and the district court clerk's office\"). Thus, the State's attorneys knew, or certainly should have known, that the mandate had not issued, and, as experienced practitioners, they also knew, or certainly should have known, that a proceeding is not technically over until the court has issued its mandate. And if concerned by the delay (and some delay in such matters is not uncommon), they could have asked the Circuit Clerk why the mandate had not issued. If necessary, they could have filed a motion seek- ing that information or seeking the mandate's immediate issuance.</p>\n<p>For another thing, since notification is a clerical duty, the panel may have thought the parties <i>had</i> been notified. One of the judges on the panel could well have instructed the Circuit Clerk not to issue the mandate, and then simply have assumed that the Clerk would notify the parties of that fact (though the Clerk, perhaps inadver- tently, did not do so). Why would the court want to hide what it was doing from the parties? Once we apply a presumption of regularity to the panel's actions, we must assume that the failure to notify the parties was likely due to a simple clerical error.</p>\n<p>Further, the prejudice to the State that troubles the Court was likely small or nonexistent. The need to reset an execution date is not uncommon, and the state court's execution order explicitly foresaw that possibility. See 373 F. 3d, at 692 (Tennessee Supreme Court order set Thomp- son's execution date for August 19, 2004, \"unless other- wise ordered by this Court or other appropriate authority\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Moreover, the State has not even argued\u0097despite ample opportunity to do so\u0097that the further proceedings ordered by the panel would actually have required it to set a new date.</p>\n<p>Finally, the State did not, by way of a petition for re- hearing, make any of its \"failure to notify\" arguments to the Court of Appeals. Although the law does not require the State to seek rehearing, such a petition would have permitted the panel to explain why the State was not notified and possibly to explore the matter of prejudice. There is no reason to reward the State for not filing a petition by assuming prejudice where none appears to exist.</p>\n<p>Given the State's likely knowledge that the mandate had not issued, the existence of avenues for resolving any uncertainty, and the small likelihood of prejudice, the lack of notice does not significantly advance the Court's \"abuse of discretion\" finding. Indeed, if the Court believes that the Court of Appeals could have issued a revised opinion correcting its earlier judgment <i>if only it had given notice to</i> <i>the parties,</i> the sanction it now imposes\u0097outright rever- sal\u0097is far out of proportion to the crime.</p>\n<p><i>Reason Two. The court's \"opportunity to consider\" the</i> <i>Sultan evidence \"at the rehearing stage is yet another</i> <i>factor supporting\" the abuse-of-discretion \"determination.\"</i> <i>Ante</i>, at 12. I agree that it is unfortunate that, upon review of the rehearing petition, the panel failed to make the connection that would have allowed it, at that time, to reach the same conclusion it reached later. Still, the petition wrongly implied that the Sultan documents were part of the original appeal. Because it did not request rehearing on the ground that the documents were <i>not</i> in the record, it did not offer a genuine \"opportunity to con- sider\" the Sultan evidence.</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, I cannot agree that the court's opportunity to consider these documents at the rehearing stage should militate in favor of finding an abuse of discretion. To the contrary, I believe we should encourage, rather than discourage, an appellate panel, when it learns that it has made a serious mistake, to take advantage of an opportunity to correct it, rather than to ignore the problem.</p>\n<p><i>Reason Three. The \"Sultan evidence . . . is not of such a</i> <i>character as to warrant [a] . . . departure from standard</i> <i>appellate procedures\" because \"the evidence was unlikely to</i> <i>have altered the District Court's resolution of Thompson's</i> <i>ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.\" Ante,</i> at 14. <i>That</i> <i>is to say, given the expert testimony in the trial court, the</i> <i>Sultan evidence is unlikely meaningfully to have strength-</i> <i>ened Thompson's claim before the Federal District Court.</i> <i>Ante</i>, at 14-15.</p>\n<p>This conclusion is wrong. The Court argues the follow- ing: (1) Dr. Sultan's conclusion rests in significant part upon interviews with three witnesses, Thompson's grand- mother and sister (with whom Dr. Sultan spoke directly) and his girlfriend (whose interview with a defense investi- gator Dr. Sultan reviewed); (2) since all three of these witnesses testified at sentencing, Thompson's counsel must have consulted them at the time; and (3) \"[c]onsultation with these witnesses, when combined with the opinions of [the State's expert] and [Thompson's ex- pert], provided an adequate basis for Thompson's attor- neys to conclude that focusing on Thompson's mental health was not the best strategy.\" <i>Ante</i>, at 16. The Court then says that trial counsel's \"strategy\" may have been \"a mistake,\" <i>ante</i>, at 17, but apparently not enough of a mistake to amount to inadequate assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p>But how do the Court's conclusions follow from the premises? Dr. Sultan's interview of the three witnesses apparently turned up new information, indeed, crucial information. Why does that fact not tend show that trial counsel's own \"consultation\" with those witnesses was inadequate? Or, if trial counsel was aware of the informa- tion, why does that not tend to show that trial counsel hired an expert who was not qualified to assess Thomp- son's mental condition, or that counsel failed adequately to convey the critical information to that expert? This Court in <i>Wiggins</i> v. <i>Smith</i>, 539 U. S. 510, 523-525 (2003), found trial counsel inadequate for failing to conduct a reasonable investigation, given notice that such an investigation would likely turn up important mitigating evidence. See also <i>Rompilla</i> v. <i>Beard</i>, <i>ante</i>, p. ___. Why is the same not true here, where Thompson's trial counsel was fully aware of the need for a background investigation, and then either did not ask the right questions, or did not hire the right expert, or did not convey the right information to that expert? At the least, is there not a good argument to this effect\u0097an argument that the Sultan documents signifi- cantly strengthened? All three judges on the panel thought so: They concluded that they would have reached a different result on Thompson's ineffective-assistance-of- counsel claim had they been aware of the Sultan docu- ments. The Court does not satisfactorily explain its basis for second-guessing the panel on this point.</p>\n<p><i>Reason Four. The Sultan evidence does \"not come close</i> <i>to satisfying the miscarriage of justice standard under</i> <i>Calderon.\" Ante,</i> at 17 (referring to <i>Calderon</i> v. <i>Thomp-</i> <i>son</i>, 523 U. S. 538 (1998)). As the Court apparently agrees, see <i>ante</i>, at 8-9, <i>Calderon</i> does not apply here. And the panel's basic conclusion\u0097that consideration of Thompson's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim with- out the benefit of the Sultan evidence would constitute a grave miscarriage of justice\u0097survives <i>any</i> plausible stan- dard of review. I can find nothing in the Court's opinion that explains why the panel's conclusion is wrong.</p>\n<p><i>Reason Five. The Court of Appeals \"did not accord the</i> <i>appropriate level of respect\" to the State's \"judgment.\"</i> <i>Ante,</i> at 19. If by \"judgment\" the Court means to refer to the state court's original judgment of conviction, this reason simply repeats Reason Four. The panel carefully examined the entire record and determined that there is a significant likelihood the Sultan evidence would demon- strate a violation of the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p>If the Court means to refer to the state court's judgment not to set aside the conviction in state postconviction proceedings, the Court is clearly wrong. The state court on collateral review refused to authorize funds for a back- ground investigation, one for which Thompson's expert then showed a strong need, and which Thompson's expert now shows could well have demonstrated a significantly mitigating mental condition. How is it disrespectful of the State for a federal habeas court to identify a constitutional error that occurred in state-court proceedings in a capital case, by taking account of a key piece of evidence, mistak- enly omitted from the record?</p>\n<p>If the Court means to refer to the State's decision to proceed with the execution, I cannot possibly agree. The Court could not mean that <i>any</i> exercise by a federal court to correct an inadvertent, and important, evidentiary error is \"disrespectful\" of a State's effort to proceed to execution. But if it does not mean \"any\" exercise at all, then how can it say the present exercise is disrespectful? The present exercise embodies as thorough an examination of the record and as significant a piece of evidence as one is likely to find. The process\u0097the detail and care with which the Court of Appeals combed the record\u0097does not show \"disrespect.\" It shows the contrary.</p>\n<p>The upshot is that the Court's five reasons are uncon- vincing. The Court simply states those reasons as conclu- sions. It fails to show how, or why, the unanimous panel erred in reaching diametrically opposite conclusions, all supported with detailed evidence set forth in Judge Suhr- heinrich's opinion. It does not satisfactorily explain the evidentiary basis for its own conclusions. And, in the process, it loses sight of the question before us: again, <i>not</i> whether we, as judges, would have reached the same conclusion that the three judges on the panel reached, but rather whether they, having unanimously agreed that their earlier decision was wrong, abused their discretion in setting it right.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Ultimately this case presents three kinds of question. The first is a narrow legal question. Has the Court of Appeals abused its discretion? For the reasons I have set forth, the answer to that question, legally speaking, must be \"no.\"</p>\n<p>The second is an epistemological question. How, in respect to matters involving the legal impact of the Sultan report and deposition, can the Court replace the panel's judgment with its own? Judge Suhrheinrich's opinion demonstrates why any assessment of that legal impact must grow out of thorough knowledge of the record. He spent hundreds of hours with its numerous documents in order to make that assessment. Those of his conclusions that were shared by the other members of the panel are logical, rest upon record-based facts, and are nowhere refuted (in respect to those facts) by anything before us or by anything in the Court's opinion. How can the Court know that the panel is wrong?</p>\n<p>The third question is about basic jurisprudence. A legal system is based on rules; it also seeks justice in the indi- vidual case. Sometimes these ends conflict. To take ac- count of such conflict, the system often grants judges a degree of discretion, thereby providing oil for the rule- based gears. When we tell the Court of Appeals that it cannot exercise its discretion to correct the serious error it discovered here, we tell courts they are not to act to cure serious injustice in similar cases. The consequence is to divorce the rule-based result from the just result. The American judicial system has long sought to avoid that divorce. Today's decision takes an unfortunate step in the wrong direction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>APPENDIX TO OPINION OF BREYER, J.</h2>\n<p>Excerpts from the Gregory Thompson Psychological Report prepared by Dr. Faye E. Sultan at the River- bend Maximum Security Institution (RMSI) (July 22, 1999), App. 11-20.</p>\n<p>\"REFERRAL QUESTIONS:\"Mr. Gregory Thompson was referred for psychological evaluation in July, 1998 by attorney Mr. Stephen M. Kissinger of the Federal Defender Services of Eastern Tennessee Incorporated. Mr. Thompson was convicted of murder in 1985. This evaluation was requested to address the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote>\"1. Mr. Thompson's current psychological status[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"2. Mr. Thompson's likely psychological status and mental state before and surrounding the time of the 1985 offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"3. Social, environmental, psychological, and economic factors in the life of Mr. Thompson which might have be[en] considered to be mitigating in nature at the time of his trial.</blockquote>\n<p>\"PROCEDURE:\"Psychological evaluation of Mr. Thompson was initiated on August 20, 1998. This first evaluation session extended over a period of approximately four hours and consisted of clinical interview and the administration of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory\u00972 (MMPI\u00972). Some review of prior psychological evaluation records was con- ducted to establish what formal psychological and neuro- psychological testing had been administered to Mr. Thompson. Levels of current intellectual and neuropsy- chological functioning had been recently assessed by neu- ropsychologist, Barry Crown, Ph.D., so no attempt was made to replicate this type of assessment. \"Following the 8-20-98 initial evaluation session, a very extensive review of legal, military, medical, prison and psychiatric/psychological records was initiated. A list of the documents examined is attached to this report.</p>\n<p>. . . . .</p>\n<p>\". . . Two further interviews were conducted with Mr. Thompson for [the] limited purpose [of determining Thompson's competence to participate in habeas proceed- ings], on 2-2-99 and 4-7-99, totaling approximately six hours of additional observation. Voluminous Tennessee Department of Corrections mental health, medical, and administrative records were reviewed at this time as well.</p>\n<p>. . . . .</p>\n<p>\"[T]he extensive record review conducted, the ten hours of clinical observations made of Mr. Thompson during the preceding eleven months, the interviews conducted with collateral informants, and the recent and past psychologi- cal testing which had been administered provide enough data to make it possible to render professional opinions about Mr. Thompson's mental state at and around the time of the 1985 offense.</p>\n<p>\"CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS:</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Gregory Thompson was cooperative with the assess- ment procedure. He answered all questions posed to him and appeared to be alert, watchful and interested in the interview process. His speech was sometimes tangential and rambling. Although motor behavior appeared con- trolled there was a manic quality to his verbalizations. Mr. Thompson was oriented as to person, place and time, but he repeatedly expressed his firm belief that he had written each and every song which played on the radio. \"Mr. Thompson displayed symptoms of psychosis during the two subsequent meetings. The details of these ses- sions will not be reviewed here.</p>\n<p>\"FORMAL PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING:</p>\n<p>\"The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality lnventory\u00972 (MMPI\u00972) was administered to Mr. Thompson on 8-20- 98. It had been determined in other examination settings that Mr. Thompson's level of reading competence exceeded the necessary level of 8th grade ability required for proper administration of this test.</p>\n<p>\"The MMPI\u00972 profile produced by Mr. Thompson is con- sidered valid and appropriate for interpretation. Indi- viduals producing similar profiles are described as experi- encing significant psychological difficulties and chronic psychological maladjustment. Such individuals are con- sidered to be highly suspicious of others, often displaying paranoid features. There is indication in this profile of the presence of a thought disorder and the inability to manage emotions. The world is perceived as a threatening and dangerous place and fears are viewed as externally gener- ated and reality-based rather than as a product of an internally generated state. The behavior of such individu- als is often described as hostile, aggressive, and rebellious against authority. Poor impulse control, lack of trust in others, and low frustration tolerance may result in such individuals displaying rage in interpersonal relationships. \"Individuals producing this testing profile are also de- scribed as experiencing depressed mood. There is the strong possibility that such individuals have contemplated suicide and report preoccupation with feeling guilty and unworthy. Testing items were endorsed which suggest memory and concentration problems, and an inability to make decisions.</p>\n<p>\"RELEVANT PSYCHOLOGICAL/PSYCHIATRIC DATA CONTAINED IN RECORDS:</p>\n<p>\"The[re] is substantial documentation throughout the Tennessee Department of Corrections records that Mr. Greg Thompson has suffered from significant mental illness since at least the time of . . . his incarceration in 1985<i>.</i> He has been treated almost continuously with some combination of major tranquilizer and/or anti-depressant and/or anti-anxiety medications. He has received a vari- ety of diagnostic labels including Psychosis, Psychosis Not Otherwise Specified, Paranoid Schizophrenia, Mania, Mixed Substance Abuse, Schizophrenia, BiPolar Affective Disorder, Schizoaffective Disorder, Malingering, and Adult Antisocial Behavior. This is clearly indicative of the Ten- nessee DOC mental health staff's view that Mr. Thompson has experienced major mental illness throughout at least most of his period of incarceration. Further, there is extensive documentation contained in these records of many episodes of bizarre aggressive and/or self-destructive behavior.</p>\n<p>\"INTERVIEWS WITH COLLATERAL WITNESSES:</p>\n<p>\"Five individuals were interviewed (either by telephone or face-to-face) who provided significant supplemental infor- mation about the life circumstances and past/present psychological functioning of Mr. Gregory Thompson.</p>\n<p>\"Ms. Maybelle Lamar</p>\n<p>\"Ms. Lamar is Mr. Thompson's maternal grandmother. She was interviewed by telephone on July 21, 1999. Ms. Lamar assumed total responsibility for the care and rear- ing of Mr. Thompson and his two older siblings after his mother was killed when Mr. Thompson was approximately five years old. Mr. Thompson remained in her home until he entered the military as a young adult.</p>\n<p>\"Ms. Lamar recalls the period following her daughter's fatal automobile accident as one of tremendous strain and disruption for her. She was unable to describe the reac- tion of the three young children to their mother's death because she 'took to my bed' for approximately five or six weeks following the accident. Ms. Lamar was unable to attend to these children in any way at that time. She did not recall how they obtained food or clothing, or whether they were in any distress. Ms. Lamar reported that she was drinking alcohol quite heavily during this period and that she left her bed to resume household activities only because the children contracted a serious medical illness. \"Ms. Lamar described Mr. Thompson as displaying signifi- cantly 'different' behavior when he returned to visit her following his discharge from the U. S. Navy. 'Greg didn't act the same'. Unlike the 'eager to please', passive, some- times funny, gentle boy who she had reared, Mr. Thomp- son was 'angry', 'sometimes sad'. 'I don't think he wanted me to know what was going on with him. He mostly just stayed away from me.' Ms. Lamar reported that she no- ticed Mr. Thompson sometimes 'staring off into space' or 'talking to himself '. She would ask him about these be- haviors. 'He'd deny it. He acted like he didn't know what I was talking about.' Ms. Lamar recalls being quite con- cerned about her grandson's mental state during this time. She did not recall ever being asked these questions at any time before or during Mr. Thompson's trial.</p>\n<p>\"Ms. Nora Jean Hall Wharton</p>\n<p>\"Nora Jean Wharton is Mr. Thompson's older sister. A lengthy telephone interview was conducted with her on July 21, 1999. She grew up in the same home as Mr. Thompson and had continuous contact with him through- out his childhood. Mr. Thompson lived briefly in the home of his sister following his discharge from the military.</p>\n<p>\"Ms. Wharton described Mr. Greg Thompson as a highly sensitive, passive, timid, emotionally vulnerable child. She described a childhood of great hardship. According to her report, their grandmother, Ms. Maybelle Lamar[,] was verbally abusive, neglectful of the children's basic daily needs, highly critical, and unable to care properly for the children. Ms. Wharton described many instances of such abuse and neglect. She described the period following their mother's death as particularly chaotic and neglectful, recalling that often there was no food in the home and that the children would take money from under their grandmother's mattress to go and buy food. In the period following their mother's death, Ms. Wharton reported that her grandmother was continuously drunk and unable to care for her grandchildren. According to Ms. Wharton, Greg Thompson frequently witnessed his sister Nora being beaten by their grandmother.</p>\n<p>\"Ms. Wharton further recalled that she and her younger brother had witnessed the brutal beating and rape of their mother by their biological father. She recalls Greg stand- ing in the scene screaming and sobbing uncontrollably.</p>\n<p>\"Ms. Wharton reported that Greg would frequently cry at school during the early school years, and, as a result, was often the victim of intense mockery from his classmates. Because Ms. Wharton was in the same classroom as her brother she observed these behaviors and often intervened on her brother's behalf. She described Mr. Thompson's response to this abuse as quite passive.</p>\n<p>\"Of particular significance is Ms. Wharton's recollections about Mr. Thompson repeatedly banging his head against the wall of their home on many occasions during their early childhood. This behavior frequently followed their grandmother yelling at Greg 'You have the Devil in you.' Mr. Thompson would tell his sister that he was attempt- ing to 'knock the Devil out' of his head in this way. Ms. Wharton recalls believing that this behavior was quite odd.</p>\n<p>\"Following his discharge from military service, Ms. Whar- ton described Mr. Thompson's behavior as significantly different than his prior conduct and attitude. She re- ported several episodes of bizarre behavior which included a sudden intense emotional reaction without obvious external provocation. Mr. Thompson would become ex- tremely angry, would cry and scream for a len[g]thy period of time, would appear as if he might or actually become quite physically violent or aggressive, and then would suddenly retreat. Ms. Thompson reported this behavior and her concerns about it to her grandmother. Ms. Lamar suggested that Ms. Wharton take her brother to the psy- chiatric unit of the local hospital for treatment. Ms. Wharton did not attempt to get any treatment for Mr. Thompson and reports feeling quite guilty about this. \"Nora Jean Wharton described her own struggles with mental illness throughout the past fifteen years. She has received counseling to assist her in coping with the effects of her abusive childhood and she has been treated with a combination of a major tranquilizer (Stellazine) and anti- depressant medications. She reported that her younger half-sister Kim has also suffered from significant mental illness.</p>\n<p>\"CUSTODY OFFICERS AT RMSI</p>\n<p>\"Following the second interview conducted with Mr. Thompson on 2-2-99, I informally interviewed two cus- tody officers who escorted Mr. Thompson back to his cell. These officers have not as yet been identified by name. Both reported that they were aware that Mr. Thompson was quite mentally ill and that they were concerned about him. They further reported that they believed it would be in his best interest to be housed in a prison facility better equipped to deal with individuals experiencing severe mental illness.</p>\n<p>\"MICHAEL CHAVIS</p>\n<p>\"Federal Defender Services of Eastern Tennessee investi- gator, Mr. Michael Chavis, was interviewed about his July 29 through August 2, 1998 interview with Ms. Arlene Cajulao in Honolulu, Hawaii. Ms. Cajulao and Mr. Thompson had an intimate relationship and lived together for approximately four years, from 1980 to 1984.</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Chavis reported that Ms. Cajulao described Mr. Thompson as displaying increasingly bizarre behavior during the latter part of their relationship. Similar to descriptions proved by Ms. Nora Wharton, Ms. Cajulao reported several episodes of 'paranoid' and aggressive behavior which had no apparent external antecedent. She reported that Mr. Thompson sometimes thought that people were 'after' him. He would close all the curtains in the house because he did not want the person who was 'looking' for him to see him through the curtains. She remembers being quite concerned about Mr. Thompson's mental state.</p>\n<p>\"SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS:</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Gregory Thompson has experienced symptoms of major mental illness throughout his adult life. Indeed, there is information available which suggests that Mr. Thompson was displaying significant signs of mental illness from the time he was a small child. Self-injurious behavior is reported as early as six years old. There is extensive documentation contained within the records reviewed for this evaluation that Mr. Thompson has ex- perienced a thought disorder and/or an affective disorder of some type for many years.</p>\n<p>\"It is my opinion that Mr. Gregory Thompson is most appropriately diagnosed, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, as having Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type. As is typical of this illness, symptoms became apparent in early adulthood. Mr. Thompson was suffering serious mental illness at the time of the 1985 offense for which he has been convicted and sentenced. This mental illness would have substantially impaired Mr. Thompson's ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. \"Further, Mr. Thompson was the victim of severe child- hood emotional abuse and physical neglect. His family background is best described as highly neglectful and  economically deprived. Mr. Thompson repeatedly wit nessed episodes of violence during his childhood in which  one family member assaulted or brutalized another.  There are significant aspects of Mr. Thompson's social history that have been recognized as mitigating in other  capital cases </p>\n<p>\"It is important to note that all of the information related  to Mr. Thompson's early mental illness and social history  was available at the time of his 1985 trial. </p>\n<p>\"[signed]</p>\n<p>\"Faye E. Sultan, Ph.D.\" </p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Excerpts from the Deposition of Dr. Faye E. Sultan (July 22, 1999), <i>Id.,</i> at 71-73, 76-80.</p>\n<p>\"Q. What indicates to you or what indicia are there for you that suggest Mr. Thompson was displaying significant signs of mental illness from the time he was a small child? How do you arrive at that conclusion?</p>\n<p>\"A. .....</p>\n<p>\"By the time of the first grade, Mr. Thompson, when he was being yelled at by his grandmother, she was report- edly verbally abusive in the following fashion: She would yell at him you have the devil in you, boy. [His sister, Ms. Wharton] would then observe Mr. Thompson standing or sitting beside a wall repeatedly banging his head into the wall. She, in her role as protector of him, would ask him what was going on, and he would tell her he was trying to knock the devil out of his head. She recalls at the time, although she was quite young herself, being worried about his behavior and thinking of it as very odd.</p>\n<p>. . . . .</p>\n<p>\"Q. Sort of a self-punishment or a self-exorcism type thing?</p>\n<p>\"A. A self-injurious behavior is what we would call it I think. Mr. Thompson, when he was Greg, in the first and second and third grade had rather frequent hysterical crying episodes in classrooms that Ms. Wharton recalls also as very unusual in the context of his schoolroom situation. She describes him as being the subject of tor- ment on the part of the students because he behaved in an odd fashion. Sometimes he would simply begin to cry and wail and scream and apparently made a sound like a fire engine when he was sobbing and developed the nickname Fire Engine. That's reported in the trial transcript. She told me much more detail about actually the extent of those kind[s] of emotional outbursts.</p>\n<p>\"At home it was rather common for Mr. Thompson to begin to cry and scream during times when Ms. Wharton herself was being beaten by their grandmother. Ms. Wharton was the victim of physical abuse on the part of the grandmother. Mr. Thompson observed much of this since they were together virtually all of the time, and Nora Wharton was not really permitted much interaction out- side of their home.</p>\n<p>. . . . .</p>\n<p>\"Q. Your diagnosis for Mr. Thompson is schizoaffective disorder, comma, bipolar type. What leads you to that diagnosis from what you've reviewed and your testing results?</p>\n<p>\"A. What leads me to the diagnosis is that there is a long history, perhaps at this point almost a 20-year his- tory, of simultaneous thought disorder on the part of Mr. Thompson documented throughout all the records, and affective disorder, emotional disorder, being unable to regulate his emotions, sometimes falling into the pits of despair and becoming suicidal, sometimes becoming highly agitated and manic and having too much energy, too much exuberance, and grandiose thinking. The thought disorder is manifested in persecutory ideas, delu- sions of grandeur\u0097lots of different kinds of delusions actually\u0097auditory hallucinations that he sometimes admits to, sometimes suspected by the doctors who are doing the examination.</p>\n<p>\"The psychological testing early on in Mr. Thompson's incarceration confirm[s] the presence of a psychotic proc- ess. There was an MMPI administered to him by a prison psychologist in 1990 that is described as valid and indica- tive of psychotic process, and throughout the prison record he receives a variety of diagnoses that take into account both thought disorder and affective illness.</p>\n<p>\"The very best diagnosis to describe all of the complex of symptoms that I just talked to you about is schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type.</p>\n<p>\"Q. You note in your report Mr. Thompson was ob- served having a significant change in behavior after he was discharged from the Navy. What significance do you attach to that fact?</p>\n<p>\"A. Well. . . [p]rior to his entry into the military Mr. Thompson is described almost uniformly . . . as passive, as compliant, as eager to please, as gentle, as timid, as eager to run from attacks.</p>\n<p>\"At some point . . . he began to notice that people were trying to hurt him all the time, that officers and other people of his rank and slightly above his rank attempted to provoke him, that they sometimes physically assaulted him, that he thought he was being followed a lot, and that he sometimes struck out in what he thought was defense and then later found out from other people who he knew and trusted that there wasn't anything to defend against or that there might not have been anything to defend against.</p>\n<p>\"Q. This is what he related to you during your interview last August?</p>\n<p>\"A. Right. The people who saw him after the military each were struck by how very different he seemed. That was the word that kept being used, 'different.' Sometimes the people I was speaking to were not able to describe what different meant, but, for example, the grandmother said that he was different as in not right, that he wasn't himself. Ms. Wharton tells me that the grandmother was very well aware that he was in deep psychological distress, and, in fact, the grandmother suggested that he be taken to the psychiatric unit at Grady Hospital in Atlanta, I believe, for treatment. The grandmother observed him staring off into space for long periods of time. She ob- served him mumbling to himself. When she asked him what he was doing, he told her he had no idea what she was talking about. She said that was very different from the boy who left her to go into service.</p>\n<p>\"The sister has even a better glimpse of him than that, because he actually went to live with her for a while, and she said he was bizarre. She described him as paranoid. She said that he would explode for no reason at all, that she was afraid of him for the very first time in her life, that they had always been terribly close, the sort of close where if there was only one piece of bread to eat they would share it, that they always looked out for one an- other, and that suddenly he was behaving in ways that she simply could not identify. She described three very serious episodes of aggression and emotional upset that she said are what led her to approach her grandmother about what to do for treatment for him.</p>\n<p>. . . . .</p>\n<p>\"Q. You state that the schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, would substantially impair Mr. Thompson's ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. How so?</p>\n<p>\"A. There are points in time when Mr. Thompson is out of contact with reality. He is responding to situations that simply don't exist or that he perceives in extremely exag- gerated or different form. A person is not able to conform one's conduct to the law if you are frankly delusional or hallucinating in some way. Mr. Thompson over the years has had both of those symptoms.</p>\n<p>\"Q. So it's this delusional aspect of this disorder that is the main factor that would keep him from having the ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of law, if I understand you correctly?</p>\n<p>\"A. Is it the main factor? Let me say that I think it's at least as potent a factor if not more as the other aspect of his mental illness, which is that he has emotional disregu- lation.</p>\n<p>\"Q. Meaning?</p>\n<p>\"A. Meaning Mr. Thompson often is not in control of his emotions. He has episodes of rage, of aggression, that he doesn't understand or relate to very well. He's told about them later. Sometimes he remembers them, sometimes he doesn't. He is often embarrassed about his behavior af- terwards, but there are points at which I believe he's not in control of what he's doing.</p>\n<p>\"Q. When you say 'he's not in control of what he's do- ing,' are you saying that it's impulsive behavior?</p>\n<p>\"A. If I am emotionally disregulated, if I'm over-aroused and overreactive and I operate out of a faulty belief sys- tem, so that not only do I have the impulse to do things that I ordinarily wouldn't, but I also think things are going on that aren't, I have a combination in which yes, I suppose you could call it impulse, but you also have to take the notion into account that it might be an impulse to do something that doesn't make any sense.</p>\n<p>\"Q. Does this disorder prevent Mr. Thompson from planning his activities?</p>\n<p>\"A. Sometimes, yes, it does.</p>\n<p>\"Q. And so the inability to plan, would that be a factor that would prevent him from conforming his conduct to the requirements of the law?</p>\n<p>\"A. If that were in operation at some time. In the his- tory of the Department of Corrections' mental health records, when he's properly medicated I don't think that's true about him.</p>\n<p>\"Q. Is it your professional opinion, then, that when he is medicated he has the ability to plan, but when he is not medicated he does not always have the ability to plan?</p>\n<p>\"A. Those two things are true. It's also true that if he's inadequately medicated or improperly medicated he doesn't have the ability to plan anything. I don't know whether he has impulses. I think he's all impulse, so to have impulses implies that there's a part of you that's not impulsive. For example, when Mr. Chavis and I saw him during my second interview with him, he could not have planned anything at all, not beyond the nanosecond in which he was experiencing the world. But he was receiv- ing psychotropic medications at the time, so that's why I have to put that qualifier in there.\"</p>\n</div>",

THOMPSON\r\n\r\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\r\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\r\n\r\n       No. 04\u2013514.      Argued April 26, 2005\u2014Decided June 27, 2005\r\nAfter respondent Thompson was convicted of murder and sentenced to\r\n  death, Tennessee state courts denied postconviction relief on his\r\n  claim that his trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to ade-\r\n  quately investigate his mental health. His federal habeas attorneys\r\n  subsequently retained psychologist Dr. Sultan, whose report and\r\n  deposition contended that Thompson suffered from serious mental\r\n  illness at the time of his offense. The District Court dismissed the\r\n  petition, but apparently Thompson\u2019s habeas counsel had failed to in-\r\n  clude Sultan\u2019s deposition and report in the record. Upholding the\r\n  dismissal, the Sixth Circuit, inter alia, found no ineffective assistance\r\n  and did not discuss Sultan\u2019s report and deposition in detail. That\r\n  court later denied rehearing, but stayed issuance of its mandate\r\n  pending disposition of Thompson\u2019s certiorari petition. After this\r\n  Court denied certiorari on December 1, 2003, the Sixth Circuit stayed\r\n  its mandate again, pending disposition of a petition for rehearing,\r\n  which this Court denied on January 20, 2004. A copy of that order\r\n  was filed with the Sixth Circuit on January 23, but the court did not\r\n  issue its mandate. The State set Thompson\u2019s execution date, and\r\n  state and federal proceedings began on his competency to be exe-\r\n  cuted. Competency proceedings were pending in the Federal District\r\n  Court on June 23, 2004, when the Sixth Circuit issued an amended\r\n  opinion in the federal habeas case, vacating the District Court\u2019s ha-\r\n  beas judgment and remanding the case for an evidentiary hearing on\r\n  the ineffective-assistance claim. The Sixth Circuit supplemented the\r\n  record on appeal with Sultan\u2019s deposition and explained that its au-\r\n  thority to issue an amended opinion five months after this Court de-\r\n  nied rehearing was based on its inherent power to reconsider an opin-\r\n  ion before issuance of the mandate.\r\n2                        BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n                                Syllabus\r\n\r\nHeld: Assuming that Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41 authorizes\r\n a stay of a mandate following a denial of certiorari and that a court\r\n may stay the mandate without entering an order, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s\r\n decision to do so here was an abuse of discretion. Pp. 6\u201319.\r\n    (a) This Court need not decide the scope of the court of appeals\u2019\r\n Rule 41 authority to withhold a mandate in order to resolve this case.\r\n Pp. 6\u20139.\r\n    (b) Prominent among the reasons warranting the result here is\r\n that the Sixth Circuit did not release its amended opinion for more\r\n than five months after this Court denied rehearing. The consequence\r\n of delay for the State\u2019s criminal justice system was compounded by\r\n the Sixth Circuit\u2019s failure to issue an order or otherwise give notice to\r\n the parties that it was reconsidering its earlier opinion. The express\r\n terms of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s stay state that the mandate would be\r\n stayed until this Court acted on the rehearing petition. Thus, once\r\n rehearing was denied, the stay dissolved by operation of law. Ten-\r\n nessee, relying on the Sixth Circuit\u2019s earlier orders and this Court\u2019s\r\n certiorari and rehearing denials could assume that the mandate\r\n would issue, especially since Thompson sought no additional stay and\r\n the Sixth Circuit gave no indication that it might be revisting its ear-\r\n lier decision. The latter point is important, for it is an open question\r\n whether a court may exercise its Rule 41(b) authority to extend the\r\n time to issue a mandate through mere inaction. Without a formal\r\n docket entry neither the parties nor this Court had, or have, any way\r\n to know whether the Sixth Circuit had stayed the mandate or simply\r\n made a clerical mistake. That court could have spared the parties\r\n and state judicial system considerable time and resources had it noti-\r\n fied them that it was reviewing its decision. The scheduling of\r\n Thompson\u2019s execution and the resulting competency proceedings\r\n were steps taken in reliance on the assumption that the federal ha-\r\n beas case was final. That assumption was all the more reasonable\r\n because the delay in issuing the mandate took place after this Court\r\n had denied certiorari, which usually signals the end of litigation. See\r\n Fed. Rule App. Proc. 41(d)(2)(D). The fact that the Sixth Circuit had\r\n the opportunity at the rehearing stage to consider the same argu-\r\n ments it eventually adopted in its amended opinion is yet another\r\n factor supporting the determination here. A review of the Sultan\r\n deposition also reinforces this conclusion. While the evidence would\r\n have been relevant to the District Court\u2019s analysis, it is not of such a\r\n character as to warrant the Sixth Circuit\u2019s extraordinary departure\r\n from standard procedures. Finally, by withholding its mandate for\r\n months\u2014based on evidence supporting only an arguable constitu-\r\n tional claim\u2014while the State prepared to carry out Thompson\u2019s sen-\r\n tence, the Sixth Circuit did not accord the appropriate level of respect\r\n                     Cite as: 545 U.

GREGORY\r\n                 THOMPSON\r\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\r\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\r\n                                 [June 27, 2005]\r\n\r\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\r\n  This case requires us to consider whether, after we had\r\ndenied certiorari and a petition for rehearing, the Court of\r\nAppeals had the power to withhold its mandate for more\r\nthan five months without entering a formal order. We\r\nhold that, even assuming a court may withhold its man-\r\ndate after the denial of certiorari in some cases, the Court\r\nof Appeals\u2019 decision to do so here was an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.\r\n                              I\r\n   In 1985, Gregory Thompson and Joanna McNamara\r\nabducted Brenda Blanton Lane from a store parking lot in\r\nShelbyville, Tennessee. After forcing Lane to drive them\r\nto a remote location, Thompson stabbed her to death.\r\nThompson offered no evidence during the guilt phase of\r\ntrial and was convicted by a jury of first-degree murder.\r\n   Thompson\u2019s defense attorneys concentrated their efforts\r\non persuading the sentencing jury that Thompson\u2019s posi-\r\ntive qualities and capacity to adjust to prison life provided\r\ngood reasons for not imposing the death penalty. Before\r\ntrial, Thompson\u2019s counsel had explored the issue of his\r\n2                    BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nmental condition. The trial judge referred Thompson to a\r\nstate-run mental health facility for a 30-day evaluation.\r\nThe resulting report indicated that Thompson was compe-\r\ntent at the time of the offense and at the time of the ex-\r\namination. The defense team retained their own expert,\r\nDr. George Copple, a clinical psychologist. At sentencing\r\nCopple testified that Thompson was remorseful and still\r\nhad the ability to work and contribute while in prison.\r\nThompson presented the character testimony of a number\r\nof witnesses, including former high school teachers, his\r\ngrandparents, and two siblings. Arlene Cajulao, Thomp-\r\nson\u2019s girlfriend while he was stationed with the Navy in\r\nHawaii, also testified on his behalf. She claimed that\r\nThompson\u2019s behavior became erratic after he suffered\r\nhead injuries during an attack by three of his fellow ser-\r\nvicemen. In rebuttal the State called Dr. Glenn Watson, a\r\nclinical psychologist who led the pretrial evaluation of\r\nThompson\u2019s competence. Watson testified that his exami-\r\nnation of Thompson revealed no significant mental illness.\r\n   The jury sentenced Thompson to death. His conviction\r\nand sentence were affirmed on direct review. State v.\r\nThompson, 768 S. W. 2d 239 (Tenn. 1989), cert. denied,\r\n497 U. S. 1031 (1990).\r\n   In his state postconviction petition, Thompson claimed\r\nhis trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to conduct\r\nan adequate investigation into his mental health. Thomp-\r\nson argued that his earlier head injuries had diminished\r\nhis mental capacity and that evidence of his condition\r\nshould have been presented as mitigating evidence during\r\nthe penalty phase of trial. Under Tennessee law, mental\r\nillness that impairs a defendant\u2019s capacity to appreciate the\r\nwrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the\r\nrequirements of the law is a mitigating factor in capital\r\nsentencing. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a739\u20132\u2013203(j)(8) (1982) (re-\r\npealed); \u00a739\u201313\u2013204(j)(8) (Lexis 2003).

The Tennes-\r\nsee Supreme Court denied discretionary review.\r\n   Thompson renewed his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\r\nclaim on federal habeas. Thompson\u2019s attorneys retained a\r\npsychologist, Dr. Faye Sultan, to assist with the proceed-\r\nings. At this point, 13 years had passed since Thompson\u2019s\r\nconviction. Sultan examined and interviewed Thompson\r\nthree times, questioned his family members, and conducted\r\nan extensive review of his legal, military, medical, and\r\nprison records, App. 12, before diagnosing him as suffering\r\nfrom schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, id., at 20. She\r\ncontended that Thompson\u2019s symptoms indicated he was\r\n\u201csuffering serious mental illness at the time of the 1985\r\noffense for which he has been convicted and sentenced.\r\nThis mental illness would have substantially impaired Mr.\r\nThompson\u2019s ability to conform his conduct to the require-\r\nments of the law.\u201d Ibid. Sultan prepared an expert report\r\non Thompson\u2019s behalf and was also deposed by the State.\r\n   In February 2000, the United States District Court for\r\nthe Eastern District of Tennessee granted the State\u2019s\r\nmotion for summary judgment and dismissed the habeas\r\npetition. The court held that Thompson failed to show\r\nthat the state court\u2019s resolution of his claim rested on an\r\nunreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent or\r\non an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of\r\nthe evidence presented in state court. See 28 U. S. C.\r\n\u00a72254(d). The District Court also stated that Thompson\r\nhad not presented \u201cany significant probative evidence that\r\n[he] was suffering from a significant mental disease that\r\nshould have been presented to the jury during the pun-\r\nishment phase as mitigation.\u201d No. 4:98\u2013CV006 (ED Tenn.,\r\nFeb. 17, 2000), App. to Pet. for Cert. 270. Sultan\u2019s deposi-\r\ntion and report, however, had apparently not been in-\r\ncluded in the District Court record.\r\n   While Thompson\u2019s appeal to the Court of Appeals for the\r\n4                    BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nSixth Circuit was pending, he filed a motion in the District\r\nCourt under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) request-\r\ning that the court supplement the record with Sultan\u2019s\r\nexpert report and deposition. Thompson\u2019s habeas counsel\r\nat the time explained that the failure to include the Sultan\r\nevidence in the summary judgment record was an over-\r\nsight. Thompson also asked the Court of Appeals to hold\r\nhis case in abeyance pending a ruling from the District\r\nCourt and attached the Sultan evidence in support of his\r\nmotion.\r\n   The District Court denied the Rule 60(b) motion as\r\nuntimely, and the Court of Appeals denied Thompson\u2019s\r\nmotion to hold his appeal in abeyance. On January 9,\r\n2003, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the\r\nDistrict Court\u2019s denial of habeas relief. 315 F. 3d 566.\r\nThe lead opinion, authored by Judge Suhrheinrich, rea-\r\nsoned that there was no ineffective assistance of counsel\r\nbecause Thompson\u2019s attorneys were aware of his head\r\ninjuries and made appropriate inquiries into his mental\r\nfitness. Id., at 589\u2013592. In particular, Thompson\u2019s attor-\r\nneys had requested that the trial court order a competency\r\nevaluation. A team of experts at the Middle Tennessee\r\nMental Health Institute, a state-run facility, found \u201cno\r\nmental illness, mental defect, or insanity.\u201d Id., at 589. Dr.\r\nGeorge Copple, the clinical psychologist retained by\r\nThompson\u2019s attorneys, also \u201cfound no evidence of mental\r\nillness.\u201d Ibid. Judge Suhrheinrich emphasized that none\r\nof the experts retained by Thompson since trial had of-\r\nfered an opinion on his mental condition at the time of the\r\ncrime. Id., at 589\u2013592. The lead opinion contained a\r\npassing reference to Thompson\u2019s unsuccessful Rule 60(b)\r\nmotion, but did not discuss the Sultan deposition or expert\r\nreport in any detail. Id., at 583, n. 13. Judge Moore con-\r\ncurred in the result based on Thompson\u2019s failure to pre-\r\nsent \u201cevidence that his counsel knew or should have\r\nknown either that Thompson was mentally ill or that his\r\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           5\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nmental condition was deteriorating at the time of his trial\r\nor at the time of his crime.\u201d Id., at 595.\r\n   Thompson filed a petition for rehearing. The petition\r\nplaced substantial emphasis on the Sultan evidence, quot-\r\ning from both her deposition and expert report. The Court\r\nof Appeals denied the petition for rehearing and stayed\r\nthe issuance of its mandate pending the disposition of\r\nThompson\u2019s petition for certiorari.\r\n   This Court denied certiorari on December 1, 2003. 540\r\nU. S. 1051. The following day, Thompson filed a motion in\r\nthe Court of Appeals seeking to extend the stay of man-\r\ndate pending disposition of his petition for rehearing in\r\nthis Court. The Court of Appeals granted the motion and\r\n\u201cordered that the mandate be stayed to allow appellant\r\ntime to file a petition for rehearing from the denial of the\r\nwrit of certiorari, and thereafter until the Supreme Court\r\ndisposes of the case.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 348. On Janu-\r\nary 20, 2004, this Court denied Thompson\u2019s petition for\r\nrehearing. 540 U. S. 1158. A copy of the order was filed\r\nwith the Court of Appeals on January 23, 2004. The Court\r\nof Appeals, however, did not issue its mandate.\r\n   The State, under the apparent assumption that the\r\nfederal habeas corpus proceedings had terminated, filed a\r\nmotion before the Tennessee Supreme Court requesting\r\nthat an execution date be set. The court scheduled\r\nThompson\u2019s execution for August 19, 2004.\r\n   From February to June 2004, there were proceedings in\r\nboth state and federal courts related to Thompson\u2019s pre-\r\nsent competency to be executed under Ford v. Wainwright,\r\n477 U. S. 399 (1986). The state courts, after considering\r\nSultan\u2019s testimony (which was based in part on followup\r\nobservations after her initial 1998 examination) as well as\r\nthat of other experts, found Thompson competent to be\r\nexecuted. Thompson v. State, 134 S. W. 3d 168 (Tenn.\r\n2004). Thompson\u2019s Ford claim was still pending before the\r\nFederal District Court when on June 23, 2004, some seven\r\n6                    BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nmonths after this Court denied certiorari, the Court of\r\nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an amended opinion\r\nin Thompson\u2019s initial federal habeas case. 373 F. 3d 688.\r\nThe new decision vacated the District Court\u2019s judgment\r\ndenying habeas relief and remanded the case for an evi-\r\ndentiary hearing on Thompson\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-\r\ncounsel claim. Id., at 691\u2013692. The Court of Appeals\r\nrelied on its equitable powers to supplement the record on\r\nappeal with Dr. Sultan\u2019s 1999 deposition after finding that\r\nit was \u201capparently negligently omitted\u201d and \u201cprobative of\r\nThompson\u2019s mental state at the time of the crime.\u201d Id., at\r\n691. The court also explained its authority to issue an\r\namended opinion five months after this Court denied a\r\npetition for rehearing: \u201c[W]e rely on our inherent power to\r\nreconsider our opinion prior to the issuance of the man-\r\ndate, which has not yet issued in this case.\u201d Id., at 691\u2013\r\n692. Judge Suhrheinrich authored a lengthy separate\r\nopinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, which\r\nexplained that his chambers initiated the sua sponte\r\nreconsideration of the case. He agreed with the majority\r\nabout the probative value of the Sultan deposition, refer-\r\nring to the evidence as \u201ccritical.\u201d Id., at 733. Unlike the\r\nmajority, however, Judge Suhrheinrich would have relied\r\nupon fraud on the court to justify the decision to expand\r\nthe record and issue an amended opinion. Id., at 725\u2013726,\r\n729\u2013742. He found \u201cimplausible\u201d the explanation offered\r\nby Thompson\u2019s habeas counsel for his failure to include\r\nthe Sultan deposition in the District Court record, id., at\r\n742, and speculated that counsel \u201cplanned to unveil Dr.\r\nSultan\u2019s opinion on the eve of Thompson\u2019s execution,\u201d id.,\r\nat 738, n. 21.\r\n   We granted certiorari. 543 U. S. ___ (2005).\r\n                              II\r\n  At issue in this case is the scope of the Court of Appeals\u2019\r\nauthority to withhold the mandate pursuant to Federal\r\n                Cite as: 545 U.

The court\u2019s mandate must issue\r\n   7 calendar days after the time to file a petition for re-\r\n   hearing expires, or 7 calendar days after entry of an\r\n   order denying a timely petition for panel rehearing,\r\n   petition for rehearing en banc, or motion for stay of\r\n   mandate, whichever is later. The court may shorten\r\n   or extend the time.\r\n     \u201c(c) Effective Date. The mandate is effective when\r\n   issued.\r\n     \u201c(d) Staying the Mandate.\r\n     \u201c(1) On Petition for Rehearing or Motion. The\r\n   timely filing of a petition for panel rehearing, petition\r\n   for rehearing en banc, or motion for stay of mandate,\r\n   stays the mandate until disposition of the petition or\r\n   motion, unless the court orders otherwise.\r\n     \u201c(2) Pending Petition for Certiorari.\r\n     \u201c(A) A party may move to stay the mandate pending\r\n   the filing of a petition for a writ of certiorari in the\r\n   Supreme Court. The motion must be served on all\r\n   parties and must show that the certiorari petition\r\n   would present a substantial question and that there is\r\n   good cause for a stay.\r\n     \u201c(B) The stay must not exceed 90 days, unless the\r\n   period is extended for good cause or unless the party\r\n   who obtained the stay files a petition for the writ and\r\n   so notifies the circuit clerk in writing within the pe-\r\n   riod of the stay. In that case, the stay continues until\r\n   the Supreme Court\u2019s final disposition.\r\n        .           .           .          .              .\r\n     \u201c(D) The court of appeals must issue the mandate\r\n   immediately when a copy of a Supreme Court order\r\n   denying the petition for writ of certiorari is filed.\u201d\r\n Tennessee argues that the Court of Appeals was re-\r\n8                    BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nquired to issue the mandate following this Court\u2019s denial\r\nof Thompson\u2019s petition for certiorari. The State\u2019s position\r\nrests on Rule 41(d)(2)(D), which states that \u201c[t]he court of\r\nappeals must issue the mandate immediately when a copy\r\nof a Supreme Court order denying the petition for writ of\r\ncertiorari is filed.\u201d This provision, the State points out,\r\nadmits of no exceptions, so the mandate should have\r\nissued on the date that a copy of this Court\u2019s order deny-\r\ning certiorari was filed with the Court of Appeals, i.e.,\r\nDecember 8, 2003.\r\n   The State further contends that because the mandate\r\nshould have issued in December 2003, the Court of Ap-\r\npeals\u2019 amended opinion was in essence a recall of the\r\nmandate. If this view is correct, the Court of Appeals\u2019\r\ndecision to revisit its earlier opinion must satisfy the\r\nstandard established by Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U. S.\r\n538 (1998). Calderon held that \u201cwhere a federal court of\r\nappeals sua sponte recalls its mandate to revisit the merits\r\nof an earlier decision denying habeas corpus relief to a state\r\nprisoner, the court abuses its discretion unless it acts to\r\navoid a miscarriage of justice as defined by our habeas\r\ncorpus jurisprudence.\u201d Id., at 558. See also Schlup v. Delo,\r\n513 U. S. 298 (1995); Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333\r\n(1992).\r\n   Thompson counters by arguing that Rule 41(d)(2)(D) is\r\ndeterminative only when the court of appeals enters a stay\r\nof the mandate to allow the Supreme Court to dispose of a\r\npetition for certiorari. The provision, Thompson says, does\r\nnot affect the court of appeals\u2019 broad discretion to enter a\r\nstay for other reasons. He relies on Rule 41(b), which\r\nprovides the court of appeals may \u201cshorten or extend the\r\ntime\u201d in which to issue the mandate. Because the author-\r\nity vested by Rule 41(b) is not limited to the period before\r\na petition for certiorari is denied, he argues that the Court\r\nof Appeals had the authority to stay its mandate following\r\nthis Court\u2019s denial of certiorari and rehearing. Although\r\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            9\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nthe Court of Appeals failed to issue an order staying the\r\nmandate after we denied rehearing, Thompson asserts\r\nthat the court exercised its Rule 41(b) powers by simply\r\nfailing to issue it.\r\n  To resolve this case, we need not adopt either party\u2019s\r\ninterpretation of Rule 41.      Instead, we hold that\u2014\r\nassuming, arguendo, both that the Rule authorizes a stay\r\nof the mandate following the denial of certiorari and also\r\nthat a court may stay the mandate without entering an\r\norder\u2014here the Court of Appeals abused its discretion in\r\ndoing so.\r\n                             III\r\n   We find an abuse of discretion for the following reasons.\r\n   Prominent among our concerns is the length of time\r\nbetween this Court\u2019s denial of certiorari and the Court of\r\nAppeals\u2019 issuance of its amended opinion. We denied\r\nThompson\u2019s petition for certiorari in December 2003 and\r\nhis petition for rehearing one month later. From this last\r\ndenial, however, the Court of Appeals delayed issuing its\r\nmandate for over five months, releasing its amended\r\nopinion in June.\r\n   The consequence of delay for the State\u2019s criminal justice\r\nsystem was compounded by the Court of Appeals\u2019 failure\r\nto issue an order or otherwise give notice to the parties\r\nthat the court was reconsidering its earlier opinion. The\r\nCourt of Appeals had issued two earlier orders staying its\r\nmandate. The first order stayed the mandate pending\r\ndisposition of Thompson\u2019s petition for certiorari. The\r\nsecond order extended the stay to allow Thompson time to\r\nfile a petition for rehearing with this Court and \u201cthereaf-\r\nter until the Supreme Court disposes of the case.\u201d So by\r\nthe express terms of the second order the mandate was not\r\nto be stayed after this Court acted; and when we denied\r\nrehearing on January 20, 2004, the Court of Appeals\u2019\r\nsecond stay dissolved by operation of law. Tennessee,\r\n10                   BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nacting in reliance on the Court of Appeals\u2019 earlier orders\r\nand our denial of certiorari and rehearing, could assume\r\nthat the mandate would\u2014indeed must\u2014issue. While it\r\nmight have been prudent for the State to verify that the\r\nmandate had issued, it is understandable that it pro-\r\nceeded to schedule an execution date. Thompson, after all,\r\nhad not sought an additional stay of the mandate, and the\r\nCourt of Appeals had given no indication that it might be\r\nrevisiting its earlier decision.\r\n   This latter point is important. It is an open question\r\nwhether a court may exercise its Rule 41(b) authority to\r\nextend the time for the mandate to issue through mere\r\ninaction. Even assuming, however, that a court could\r\neffect a stay for a short period of time by withholding the\r\nmandate, a delay of five months is different in kind.\r\n\u201cBasic to the operation of the judicial system is the princi-\r\nple that a court speaks through its judgments and orders.\u201d\r\nMurdaugh Volkswagen, Inc. v. First National Bank of\r\nSouth Carolina, 741 F. 2d 41, 44 (CA4 1984). Without a\r\nformal docket entry neither the parties nor this Court had,\r\nor have, any way to know whether the court had stayed\r\nthe mandate or simply made a clerical mistake. Cf. Bal-\r\nlard v. Commissioner, 544 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at\r\n17). The dissent claims \u201cthe failure to notify the parties\r\nwas likely due to a simple clerical error\u201d on the part of the\r\nClerk\u2019s office. Post, at 12\u201313 (opinion of BREYER, J.). The\r\nrecord lends no support to this speculation. The dissent\r\nalso fails to explain why it is willing to apply a \u201cpresump-\r\ntion of regularity\u201d to the panel\u2019s actions but not to the\r\nClerk\u2019s. Ibid.\r\n   The Court of Appeals could have spared the parties and\r\nthe state judicial system considerable time and resources\r\nif it had notified them that it was reviewing its original\r\npanel decision. After we denied Thompson\u2019s petition for\r\nrehearing, Tennessee scheduled his execution date. This,\r\nin turn, led to various proceedings in state and federal\r\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           11\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ncourt to determine Thompson\u2019s present competency to be\r\nexecuted. See, e.g., Thompson v. State, 134 S. W. 3d 168\r\n(Tenn. 2004). All of these steps were taken in reliance on\r\nthe mistaken impression that Thompson\u2019s first federal\r\nhabeas case was final. The State had begun to \u201cinvok[e]\r\nits entire legal and moral authority in support of executing\r\nits judgment.\u201d Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U. S., at 556\u2013\r\n557.\r\n   The parties\u2019 assumption that Thompson\u2019s habeas pro-\r\nceedings were complete was all the more reasonable be-\r\ncause the Court of Appeals\u2019 delay in issuing its mandate\r\ntook place after we had denied certiorari. As a practical\r\nmatter, a decision by this Court denying discretionary\r\nreview usually signals the end of litigation. While Rule\r\n41(b) may authorize a court to stay the mandate after\r\ncertiorari is denied, the circumstances where such a stay\r\nwould be warranted are rare. See, e.g., First Gibraltar\r\nBank, FSB v. Morales, 42 F. 3d 895 (CA5 1995); Alphin v.\r\nHenson, 552 F. 2d 1033 (CA4 1977). In the typical case,\r\nwhere the stay of mandate is entered solely to allow this\r\nCourt time to consider a petition for certiorari, Rule\r\n41(d)(2)(D) provides the default: \u201cThe court of appeals\r\nmust issue the mandate immediately when a copy of a\r\nSupreme Court order denying the petition for writ of\r\ncertiorari is filed.\u201d\r\n   By providing a mechanism for correcting errors in the\r\ncourts of appeals before Supreme Court review is re-\r\nquested, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure ensure\r\nthat litigation following the denial of certiorari will be\r\ninfrequent. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 40(a) (\u201cUnless the\r\ntime is shortened or extended by order or local rule, a\r\npetition for panel rehearing may be filed within 14 days\r\nafter entry of judgment\u201d). See also Fed. Rules App. Proc.\r\n35 (rehearing en banc), 40 (panel rehearing).\r\n   Indeed, in this case Thompson\u2019s petition for rehearing\r\nand suggestion for rehearing en banc pressed the same\r\n12                   BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\narguments that eventually were adopted by the Court of\r\nAppeals in its amended opinion. The Sultan evidence,\r\nfirst presented to the Court of Appeals as an attachment\r\nto Thompson\u2019s motion to hold his appeal in abeyance, was\r\nquoted extensively in the petition for rehearing to the\r\nCourt of Appeals. Pet. for Rehearing and Suggestion for\r\nRehearing En Banc in No. 2:00\u20135516 (CA6), pp. 12\u201320,\r\n28\u201331. After the request for rehearing was denied, the\r\nState could have assumed with good reason that the Court\r\nof Appeals was not impressed by Thompson\u2019s arguments\r\nbased on the Sultan evidence. The court\u2019s opportunity to\r\nconsider these arguments at the rehearing stage is yet\r\nanother factor supporting our determination that the\r\ndecision to withhold the mandate was in error. Cf.\r\nCalderon v. Thompson, supra, at 551\u2013553 (questioning\r\nwhether a \u201cmishandled law clerk transition\u201d and the \u201cfailure\r\nof another judge to notice the action proposed by the original\r\npanel\u201d would justify recalling the mandate in a nonhabeas\r\ncase).\r\n   The dissent\u2019s explanation of how the Sultan evidence\r\nwas overlooked is inaccurate in several respects. For\r\nexample, the statements that the \u201cSultan documents were\r\nnot in the initial record on appeal,\u201d post, at 9, and that\r\n\u201cthe panel previously had not seen these documents\u201d\r\nbefore the rehearing stage, id., at 9, convey the wrong\r\nimpression. Although the Sultan evidence was not part of\r\nthe District Court\u2019s summary judgment record, the docu-\r\nments were included in the certified record on appeal as\r\nattachments to Thompson\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion. Record\r\n133; Docket Entry 4/5/02 in No. 98\u2013CV\u20136 (ED Tenn.);\r\nDocket Entry 4/10/02 in No. 00\u20135516 (CA6). The dissent\r\nalso argues the petition for rehearing did not adequately\r\nbring the Sultan evidence to the attention of the Court of\r\nAppeals. Post, at 9\u201310, 13\u201314. This is simply untrue. The\r\noriginal panel opinion, which did not discuss the Sultan\r\nevidence in any detail, emphasized that Thompson had\r\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)          13\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nfailed to produce any evidence that he was mentally ill at\r\nthe time of his offense. 315 F. 3d, at 590; id., at 595\u2013596\r\n(Moore, J., concurring). The petition for rehearing attacked\r\nthis conclusion in no uncertain terms and placed the Sultan\r\nevidence front and center. Here, for example, is an excerpt\r\nfrom the petition\u2019s table of contents:\r\n       \u201cII. THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE IS NO\r\n    EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN THE RECORD OF\r\n    THOMPSON\u2019S MENTAL ILLESS AT THE TIME OF\r\n    THE CRIME IS WRONG\r\n       \u201cA.

The rehearing petition did not explain why\r\nSultan\u2019s deposition and expert report had been omitted\r\nfrom the summary judgment record but that is beside the\r\npoint. The petition acknowledged that the Sultan evi-\r\ndence was first presented to the District Court as an at-\r\ntachment to the Rule 60(b) motion, id., at 29, and gave the\r\nSultan evidence a prominent and explicit mention in the\r\ntable of contents. It is difficult to see how Thompson\u2019s\r\ncounsel could have been clearer in telling the Court of\r\nAppeals that it was wrong. The dissent\u2019s treatment of this\r\nissue assumes that judges forget even the basic details of a\r\ncapital case only one month after issuing a 38-page opin-\r\nion and that judges cannot be relied upon to read past the\r\nfirst page of a petition for rehearing. The problem is that\r\nthe dissent cannot have it both ways: If the Sultan evi-\r\ndence is as crucial as the dissent claims, it would not\r\n14                  BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\neasily have been overlooked by the Court of Appeals at the\r\nrehearing stage.\r\n   Our review of the Sultan deposition reinforces our con-\r\nclusion that the Court of Appeals abused its discretion by\r\nwithholding the mandate. Had the Sultan deposition and\r\nreport been fully considered in the federal habeas proceed-\r\nings, it no doubt would have been relevant to the District\r\nCourt\u2019s analysis. Based on the Sultan deposition Thomp-\r\nson could have argued he suffered from mental illness at\r\nthe time of his crime that would have been a mitigating\r\nfactor under Tennessee law and that his trial attorneys\r\nwere constitutionally ineffective for failing to conduct an\r\nadequate investigation into his mental health.\r\n   Relevant though the Sultan evidence may be, however,\r\nit is not of such a character as to warrant the Court of\r\nAppeals\u2019 extraordinary departure from standard appellate\r\nprocedures. There are ample grounds to conclude the\r\nevidence was unlikely to have altered the District Court\u2019s\r\nresolution of Thompson\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\r\nclaim. Sultan examined Thompson for the first time on\r\nAugust 20, 1998, App. 37, some 13 years after Thompson\u2019s\r\ncrime and conviction. She relied on the deterioration in\r\nThompson\u2019s present mental health\u2014something that obvi-\r\nously was not observable at the time of trial\u2014as evidence\r\nof his condition in 1985. (Indeed, there was a marked\r\ndecline in his condition during the 6-month period be-\r\ntween Sultan\u2019s first two visits. Id., at 51\u201358.) Sultan\u2019s\r\nfindings regarding Thompson\u2019s condition in 1985 are\r\ncontradicted by the testimony of two experts who exam-\r\nined him at the time of trial, Dr. Watson and Dr. Copple.\r\nWatson performed a battery of tests at the Middle Tennes-\r\nsee Mental Health Institute, where Thompson was re-\r\nferred by the trial court for an examination, and concluded\r\nthat Thompson \u201c \u2018[did] not appear to be suffering from any\r\ncomplicated mental disorder which would impair his\r\ncapacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of the alleged\r\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           15\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\noffenses, or which would impair his capacity to conform\r\nhis conduct to the requirements of the law.\u2019 \u201d 19 Tr. 164.\r\nIndeed, Watson presented substantial evidence supporting\r\nhis conclusion that Thompson was malingering for mental\r\nillness. Id., at 151\u2013152; 20 id., at 153\u2013160. For example,\r\nThompson claimed he could not read despite a B average\r\nin high school and one year\u2019s college credit. 19 id., at 137;\r\n20 id., at 151. Thompson\u2019s test scores also indicated that\r\nhe was attempting to fake schizophrenia. 20 id., at 153\u2013\r\n154. Copple, the psychologist retained by Thompson\u2019s\r\ndefense team, agreed with Watson that Thompson was not\r\nsuffering from mental illness. 19 id., at 58. Had the\r\nSultan deposition been included in the District Court\r\nrecord, Thompson still would have faced an uphill battle to\r\nobtaining federal habeas relief. He would have had to\r\nargue that his trial attorneys should have continued to\r\ninvestigate his mental health even after both Watson and\r\nCopple had opined that there was nothing to uncover.\r\n   Sultan\u2019s testimony does not negate Thompson\u2019s respon-\r\nsibility for committing the underlying offense, but it does\r\nbear upon an argument that Thompson\u2019s attorneys could\r\nhave presented at sentencing. Sultan\u2019s ultimate conclu-\r\nsion\u2014that Thompson\u2019s mental illness substantially im-\r\npaired his ability to conform his conduct to the require-\r\nments of the law\u2014is couched in the language of a\r\nmitigating factor under Tennessee law. Tenn. Code Ann.\r\n\u00a739\u20132\u2013203(j)(8) (1982). See also \u00a739\u201313\u2013204(j)(8) (Lexis\r\n2003). Thompson\u2019s trial attorneys, however, chose not to\r\npursue a mitigation strategy based on mental illness,\r\nstressing instead character evidence from family and\r\nfriends and expert testimony that he had the capacity to\r\nadjust to prison. Thompson v. State, 958 S. W. 2d, at 164\u2013\r\n165. This strategic calculation, while ultimately unsuc-\r\ncessful, was based on a reasonable investigation into\r\nThompson\u2019s background. Sultan relied on three witnesses\r\nin preparing her report: Thompson\u2019s grandmother, sister,\r\n16                  BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nand ex-girlfriend. These witnesses not only were inter-\r\nviewed by the defense attorneys; they testified at sentenc-\r\ning. Consultation with these witnesses, when combined\r\nwith the opinions of Watson and Copple, provided an\r\nadequate basis for Thompson\u2019s attorneys to conclude that\r\nfocusing on Thompson\u2019s mental health was not the best\r\nstrategy. As the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals\r\nnoted, \u201cBecause two experts did not detect brain damage,\r\ncounsel cannot be faulted for discarding a strategy that\r\ncould not be supported by a medical opinion.\u201d Id., at 165.\r\n   Without a single citation to the record, the dissent sug-\r\ngests that Thompson\u2019s attorneys failed to conduct ade-\r\nquate interviews of the defense witnesses on whom Sultan\r\nrelied in her report. Post, at 14\u201315. Most of the informa-\r\ntion on Thompson\u2019s childhood was provided to Sultan by\r\nNora Jean Wharton, Thompson\u2019s older sister. App. 16\u201318.\r\nSetting aside the fact that Thompson did not argue in\r\nstate court that his counsel\u2019s interview of Wharton was\r\ninadequate, Thompson v. State, 958 S. W. 2d, at 160\u2013169,\r\nThompson\u2019s attorneys cannot be faulted for failing to elicit\r\nfrom her any details on Thompson\u2019s difficult home life.\r\nAfter all, Wharton testified at trial that Thompson\u2019s child-\r\nhood was \u201cpoor,\u201d but \u201cvery happy.\u201d 18 Tr. 3. The dissent\r\nalso implies that the experts who examined Thompson\r\nlacked information necessary to reach an accurate as-\r\nsessment. The record refutes this assertion. In conduct-\r\ning his examination, Watson had access to Thompson\u2019s\r\nsocial history and military records. 19 id., at 149; 20 id.,\r\nat 186 (Exh. 102, pp. 11, 27\u201328). Watson was also aware\r\nof the prior head injuries as well as Thompson\u2019s claim that\r\nhe heard voices. 19 id., at 152; 20 id., at 154\u2013155. Never-\r\ntheless, Watson, whose evaluation was contemporaneous\r\nwith the trial, found no evidence that Thompson was\r\nmentally ill at the time of the crime. Watson\u2019s report was\r\nunequivocal on this point:\r\n                  Cite as: 545 U.

His affect\r\n    was appropriate to his thought content, and he exhib-\r\n    ited no flight of ideas, manic, depressed, or bizarre\r\n    behaviors, and his speech was not pressured nor\r\n    rapid. He exhibited none of the signs of an affective\r\n    illness. His judgment and insight are rather poor.\r\n    Psychological testing revealed him to be functioning\r\n    in the average range intellectually, to exhibit no signs\r\n    of organicity or brain damage on the Bender-Gestalt\r\n    Test and the Bender Interference Procedure. Person-\r\n    ality profiles revealed no evidence of a psychosis, but\r\n    indicated malingering in the mental illness direction.\r\n    (For example, the schizophrenic score was at T 120,\r\n    while clinical observations revealed no evidence of a\r\n    thought disorder.) Mr. Thompson\u2019s memory for recent\r\n    and remote events appeared unimpaired.\u2019 \u201d 20 id., at\r\n    159\u2013160.\r\n   Sultan\u2019s testimony provides some support for the argu-\r\nment that the strategy of emphasizing Thompson\u2019s posi-\r\ntive attributes was a mistake in light of Thompson\u2019s dete-\r\nriorated condition 13 years after the trial. This evidence,\r\nhowever, would not come close to satisfying the miscar-\r\nriage of justice standard under Calderon had the Court of\r\nAppeals recalled the mandate. Neither, in our view, did\r\nthis evidence justify the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision to\r\nwithhold the mandate without notice to the parties, which\r\nin turn led the State to proceed for five months on the\r\nmistaken assumption that the federal habeas proceedings\r\nhad terminated. The dissent suggests that failing to take\r\naccount of the Sultan evidence would result in a \u201cmiscar-\r\nriage of justice,\u201d post, at 1\u20132, 16, but the dissent uses that\r\n18                   BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nphrase in a way that is inconsistent with our precedents.\r\nIn Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S., at 545\u2013547, this Court held\r\nthat additional mitigating evidence could not meet the\r\nmiscarriage of justice standard. Only evidence that affects\r\na defendant\u2019s eligibility for the death penalty\u2014which the\r\nSultan evidence is not\u2014can support a miscarriage of\r\njustice claim in the capital sentencing context. Id., at 547;\r\nCalderon, 523 U. S., at 559\u2013560.\r\n   One last consideration informs our review of the Court\r\nof Appeals\u2019 actions. In Calderon, we held that federalism\r\nconcerns, arising from the unique character of federal\r\nhabeas review of state-court judgments, and the policies\r\nembodied in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Pen-\r\nalty Act of 1996 required an additional presumption\r\nagainst recalling the mandate. This case also arises from\r\nfederal habeas corpus review of a state conviction. While\r\nthe State\u2019s reliance interest is not as strong in a case\r\nwhere, unlike Calderon, the mandate has not issued, the\r\nfinality and comity concerns that animated Calderon are\r\nimplicated here. Here a dedicated judge discovered what\r\nhe believed to have been an error, and we are respectful of\r\nthe Court of Appeals\u2019 willingness to correct a decision that\r\nit perceived to have been mistaken. A court\u2019s discretion\r\nunder Rule 41 must be exercised, however, in a way that\r\nis consistent with the \u201c \u2018State\u2019s interest in the finality of\r\nconvictions that have survived direct review within the\r\nstate court system.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 555 (quoting Brecht v. Abra-\r\nhamson, 507 U. S. 619, 635 (1993)). Tennessee expended\r\nconsiderable time and resources in seeking to enforce a\r\ncapital sentence rendered 20 years ago, a sentence that\r\nreflects the judgment of the citizens of Tennessee that\r\nThompson\u2019s crimes merit the ultimate punishment. By\r\nwithholding the mandate for months\u2014based on evidence\r\nthat supports only an arguable constitutional claim\u2014while\r\nthe State prepared to carry out Thompson\u2019s sentence, the\r\nCourt of Appeals did not accord the appropriate level of\r\n                 Cite as: 545 U.

Thompson, su-\r\npra, at 554\u2013557.\r\n   The Court of Appeals may have been influenced by\r\nSultan\u2019s unsettling account of Thompson\u2019s condition dur-\r\ning one of her visits. She described Thompson as being in\r\n\u201cterrible psychological condition,\u201d \u201cphysically filthy,\u201d and\r\n\u201chighly agitated.\u201d App. 51. This testimony raised ques-\r\ntions about Thompson\u2019s deteriorating mental health and\r\nperhaps his competence to be executed, but these concerns\r\nwere properly addressed in separate proceedings. Based\r\non the most recent state-court decision, which rejected the\r\nargument that Thompson is not competent to be executed,\r\nit appears that his condition has improved. Thompson v.\r\nState, 134 S. W. 3d, at 184\u2013185. Proceedings on this issue\r\nwere underway in the District Court when the Court of\r\nAppeals issued its second opinion. If those proceedings\r\nresume, the District Court will have an opportunity to\r\naddress these matters again and in light of the current\r\nevidence.\r\n   Taken together these considerations convince us that\r\nthe Court of Appeals abused any discretion Rule 41 ar-\r\nguably granted it to stay its mandate, without entering a\r\nformal order, after this Court had denied certiorari.

GREGORY\r\n                 THOMPSON\r\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\r\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\r\n                        [June 27, 2005]\r\n\r\n   JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE\r\nSOUTER, and JUSTICE GINSBURG join, dissenting.\r\n   This capital case arises out of unusual circumstances\u2014\r\ncircumstances of a kind that I have not previously experi-\r\nenced in the 25 years I have served on the federal bench.\r\nAfter an appellate court writes and releases an opinion,\r\nbut before it issues its mandate, the writing judge,\r\nthrough happenstance, comes across a document that (he\r\nreasonably believes) shows not only that the court\u2019s initial\r\ndecision is wrong but that the decision will lead to a seri-\r\nous miscarriage of justice. What is the judge to do?\r\n   What the judge did here was to spend time\u2014hundreds\r\nof hours (while a petition for certiorari was pending before\r\nthis Court and during the five months following our denial\r\nof the petition for rehearing)\u2014reviewing the contents of\r\nthe vast record with its many affidavits, reports, tran-\r\nscripts, and other documents accumulated in the course of\r\nnumerous state and federal proceedings during the pre-\r\nceding 20 years. The judge ultimately concluded that his\r\ninitial instinct about the document was correct. The\r\ndocument was critically important. It could affect the\r\noutcome of what is, and has always been, the major issue\r\nin the case. To consider the case without reference to it\r\ncould mean a miscarriage of justice.\r\n   The judge consequently wrote a lengthy opinion (almost\r\n2                    BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n30,000 words) explaining what had happened. The other\r\nmembers of the panel did not agree with everything in\r\nthat opinion, but they did agree that their initial decision\r\nmust be vacated.\r\n   The Court commendably describes what occurred as\r\nfollows: A \u201cdedicated judge discovered what he believed to\r\nhave been an error, and we are respectful of the Court of\r\nAppeals\u2019 willingness to correct a decision that it perceived\r\nto have been mistaken.\u201d Ante, at 18. The Court, however,\r\ndoes not decide this case in a manner consistent with that\r\nobservation. A somewhat more comprehensive account of\r\nthe nature of the \u201cerror\u201d\u2014of the matter at stake, of the\r\nimportance of the document, of the mystery of its late\r\nappearance, of the potential for a miscarriage of justice\u2014\r\nshould help make apparent the difficult circumstance the\r\npanel believed it faced. It will also explain why there was\r\nno \u201cabuse\u201d of discretion in the panel\u2019s effort to \u201ccorrect a\r\ndecision that it perceived to have been mistaken.\u201d\r\n                              I\r\n  Judge Suhrheinrich, the panel member who investi-\r\ngated the record, is an experienced federal judge, serving\r\nsince 1984 as a federal trial court judge and since 1990 as\r\na federal appellate judge. He wrote a lengthy account of\r\nthe circumstances present here. To understand this case,\r\none must read that full account and then compare it with\r\nthe Court\u2019s truncated version. I provide a rough summary\r\nof the matter based upon my own reading of his opinion.\r\n373 F. 3d 688, 692\u2013742 (CA6 2004).\r\n                              A\r\n  The panel\u2019s initial decision, issued on January 9, 2003,\r\nfocused upon an issue often raised when federal habeas\r\ncourts review state proceedings in a capital case, namely,\r\nthe effectiveness of counsel at the original trial. 315 F. 3d\r\n566, 587\u2013594 (CA6 2003). See Strickland v. Washington,\r\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           3\r\n\r\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n466 U. S. 668 (1984). In this instance, the federal ineffec-\r\ntive-assistance claim was that state trial counsel had not\r\nsufficiently investigated the background of the defendant,\r\nGregory Thompson. Thompson claimed that an adequate\r\ninvestigation would have shown, to the satisfaction of\r\ntestifying experts, that he suffered from episodes of\r\nschizophrenia at the time of the crime. The schizophre-\r\nnia\u2014though episodic\u2014would have proved a mitigating\r\ncircumstance at the penalty phase. 373 F. 3d, at 697\u2013698,\r\nand n. 4.\r\n   Thompson\u2019s trial took place in a Tennessee state court,\r\nwhere he was found guilty of murder and sentenced to\r\ndeath. His state-appointed counsel put on no defense at\r\ntrial. At sentencing, however, counsel sought to show that\r\nThompson was schizophrenic. State forensic psychologists\r\nexamined Thompson and concluded that Thompson,\r\nprobably \u201cmalingering,\u201d did not show genuine and signifi-\r\ncant symptoms of schizophrenia at that time and was not\r\nmentally ill. A clinical psychologist hired by Thompson\u2019s\r\ncounsel examined Thompson for eight hours and reached\r\napproximately the same conclusion: he said that Thomp-\r\nson was not then mentally ill. Id., at 692, 694\u2013695.\r\n   Thompson raised the issue of his mental condition in\r\nstate postconviction proceedings, which he initiated in\r\n1990. His expert witness, Dr. Gillian Blair, testified (with\r\nmuch supportive material) that Thompson was by that\r\ntime clearly displaying serious schizophrenic symptoms\u2014\r\nvoice illusions, attempts at physical self-mutilation, and\r\nthe like. Indeed, the State conceded that he was under a\r\nregime of major antipsychotic medication. But Dr. Blair\r\nsaid that she could not determine whether Thompson had\r\nbeen similarly afflicted (i.e., suffering from episodes of\r\nschizophrenia) at the time of the crime without a thorough\r\nbackground investigation\u2014funds for which the state court\r\ndeclined to make available. The state court then ruled in\r\nthe State\u2019s favor. Id., at 694\u2013695.\r\n4                   BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n   Thompson filed a habeas petition in Federal District\r\nCourt about eight months after the state court\u2019s denial of\r\npostconviction relief became final. As I said above, see\r\nsupra, at 3, he claimed ineffective assistance of counsel.\r\nThe Federal District Court appointed counsel, an assistant\r\nfederal public defender. Counsel then obtained the ser-\r\nvices of two experts, Dr. Barry Crown and Dr. Faye Sul-\r\ntan. Both examined Thompson, and the latter, Dr. Sultan,\r\nconducted the more thorough background investigation\r\nthat Dr. Blair had earlier sought. The State, after depos-\r\ning Dr. Sultan, moved for summary judgment. 373 F. 3d,\r\nat 696, 700\u2013704, 711.\r\n   The District Court granted that motion on the ground\r\nthat \u201cThompson has not provided this Court with anything\r\nother than factually unsupported allegations that he was\r\nincompetent at the time he committed the crime,\u201d nor \u201chas\r\nThompson provided this Court with any significant proba-\r\ntive evidence that [he] was suffering from a significant\r\nmental disease that should have been presented to the\r\njury during the punishment phase as mitigation evidence.\u201d\r\nId., at 712\u2013713 (quoting District Court\u2019s memorandum\r\nopinion (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted)).\r\n   Thompson (now with a new public defender as counsel)\r\nappealed the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment\r\nin the State\u2019s favor. (A little over a year later, while the\r\nappeal was still pending, Thompson\u2019s new counsel, appar-\r\nently having discovered that Dr. Sultan\u2019s deposition and\r\nreport had not been included in the record before the\r\nDistrict Court, filed a motion in that court for relief from\r\njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b),\r\nseeking to supplement the record with those documents.\r\nCounsel also filed a motion in the appellate court, with the\r\nSultan deposition attached, requesting that the appeal be\r\nheld in abeyance while the District Court considered the\r\nRule 60(b) motion.      Both motions were denied, and\r\nThompson\u2019s counsel did not take an appeal from the Dis-\r\n                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            5\r\n\r\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ntrict Court\u2019s denial of the Rule 60(b) motion.) 373 F. 3d, at\r\n714\u2013715, and n. 10, 724\u2013725.\r\n    The Court of Appeals reviewed the District Court\u2019s\r\ngrant of summary judgment. In doing so, the appellate\r\npanel examined the record before that court. It noted that\r\nThompson\u2019s federal habeas counsel had hired two experts\r\n(Crown and Sultan), and had told the court (in an offer of\r\nproof) that they would provide evidence that Thompson\r\nsuffered from mental illness at the time of the crime. But\r\nthe appellate panel found that neither expert had done so.\r\nIndeed, said the panel, Thompson had \u201cnever submitted to\r\nany court any proof that he suffered from severe mental\r\nillness at the time of the crime.\u201d 315 F. 3d, at 590 (em-\r\nphasis altered). Though Thompson\u2019s several attorneys\r\nhad made the same allegation for many years in several\r\ndifferent courts (said the panel), \u201cat each opportunity,\r\ncounsel fail[ed] to secure an answer to the critical issue of\r\nwhether Thompson was mentally ill at the time of the\r\ncrime.\u201d Ibid. That fact, concluded the panel (over a dis-\r\nsent), was fatal to Thompson\u2019s basic ineffective-assistance-\r\nof-counsel claim. Obviously \u201ctrial counsel cannot be\r\ndeemed ineffective for failing to discover something that\r\ndoes not appear to exist.\u201d Ibid.; see also id., at 595 (Moore,\r\nJ., concurring in result) (\u201cThompson has presented no\r\nevidence that his [trial] counsel knew or should have\r\nknown either that Thompson was mentally ill or that his\r\nmental condition was deteriorating at the time of his trial\r\nor at the time of his crime\u201d). The dissenting judge thought\r\nThompson had made out an ineffective-assistance claim by\r\nshowing that his trial counsel had relied on an inadequate\r\nexpert, that is, an expert without the necessary qualifica-\r\ntions to counter the State\u2019s experts\u2019 conclusions. Id., at\r\n599\u2013605 (opinion of Clay, J.).\r\n   The appeals court issued its opinion on January 9, 2003.\r\nThompson\u2019s appointed federal appeals counsel filed a\r\nrehearing petition, which the court denied on March 10,\r\n6                   BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n2003. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 346 (Order in No. 00\u20135516\r\n(CA6)). Thompson\u2019s counsel then sought Supreme Court\r\nreview. This Court denied review (and rehearing) about\r\none year later. 540 U. S. 1051 (2003) (denying certiorari);\r\n540 U. S. 1158 (2004) (denying rehearing).\r\n                               B\r\n  The Court of Appeals, following ordinary appellate-court\r\npractice, withheld issuance of its mandate while the case\r\nwas under review here, namely during calendar year 2003.\r\nDuring that time and in the months that followed, some-\r\nthing unusual happened. Judge Suhrheinrich realized\r\nthat the panel, in reaching its decision, seemed to have\r\noverlooked documents provided by Dr. Sultan that likely\r\nwere relevant. In September 2003, the appellate court\r\ncalled for the entire certified record. Upon reviewing that\r\nrecord, Judge Suhrheinrich found Dr. Sultan\u2019s deposition\r\nand accompanying report. 373 F. 3d, at 692\u2013693; App. to\r\nPet. for Cert. 347\u2013348; see also Appendix, infra.\r\n  The Sultan documents filled the evidentiary gap that\r\nunderlay the District Court\u2019s and the appellate panel\u2019s\r\ndeterminations. These documents made clear that Dr.\r\nSultan had investigated Thompson\u2019s background in depth\r\nand that in her (well-supported) opinion, Thompson had\r\nsuffered from serious episodic bouts of schizophrenia at\r\nthe time the crime was committed. Clearly the documents\r\ncontained evidence supporting Thompson\u2019s claim regard-\r\ning his mental state at the time of the offense. Why had\r\nthe District Court denied the existence of any such evi-\r\ndence? Why had Judge Suhrheinrich, and the other mem-\r\nbers of the panel (and the State, which took Dr. Sultan\u2019s\r\ndeposition) done the same?\r\n  Judge Suhrheinrich then drafted an opinion that sought\r\nto answer three questions:\r\n  Question One: Do these documents actually provide\r\nstrong evidence that Thompson was schizophrenic (and\r\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           7\r\n\r\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nseriously so) at the time of the crime?\r\n   Question Two: If so, given the many previous opportuni-\r\nties that Thompson has had to raise the issue of his men-\r\ntal health, to what extent would these documents be likely\r\nto matter in respect to the legal question raised in Thomp-\r\nson\u2019s federal proceedings, i.e., would they likely lead a\r\nfederal habeas court to hold that Thompson\u2019s trial counsel\r\nwas ineffective for failing to undertake a background\r\ninvestigation akin to that performed by Dr. Sultan?\r\n   Question Three: How did these documents previously\r\nescape our attention?\r\n                              1\r\n   The panel answered the first question\u2014regarding the\r\nimportance of the documents\u2014unanimously. Sultan\u2019s\r\nreport and deposition were critically important. As Judge\r\nSuhrheinrich\u2019s opinion explains, these documents detail\r\nThompson\u2019s horrendous childhood, his family history of\r\nmental illness, his self-destructive schizophrenic behavior\r\n(including auditory hallucinations) as a child, his mood\r\nswings and bizarre behavior as a young adult, and a wors-\r\nening of that behavior after a serious beating to his head\r\nthat he suffered while in the Navy. For example, Dr.\r\nSultan\u2019s examination of Thompson and her interviews\r\nwith Thompson\u2019s family members and others revealed that\r\nas a child Thompson would repeatedly bang his head\r\nagainst the wall to \u201cknock the Devil out\u201d after his grand-\r\nmother yelled at him, \u201cYou have the Devil in you.\u201d 373\r\nF. 3d, at 716 (internal quotation marks omitted). These\r\ndocuments explain how Thompson, as a young adult,\r\nwould talk to himself and scream and cry for no apparent\r\nreason. They suggest that he had bouts of paranoia.\r\n   The documents provide strong support for the conclu-\r\nsion that Thompson suffered from episodes of schizophre-\r\nnia at the time of the offense. And they thereby offer\r\nsignificant support for the conclusion that, had earlier\r\n8                   BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ntestifying experts had this information, they could have\r\ncountered the State\u2019s experts\u2019 conclusion that Thompson\r\nwas malingering at the time of trial. Thus, the Sultan\r\nmaterials seriously undermined the foundation of the\r\nState\u2019s position in respect to Thompson\u2019s mental condition.\r\n  The Sultan materials also revealed that trial counsel\r\nfailed to discover other mitigating evidence of importance.\r\nInterviews with family members revealed repeated inci-\r\ndents of violence in the family, including an episode in\r\nwhich, as a young boy, Thompson witnessed his father\r\nbrutally beat and rape his mother. His grandmother, with\r\nwhom Thompson and his siblings lived after their mother\r\ndied, subjected them to abuse and neglect. She would\r\nforget to feed the children, leaving them to steal money\r\nfrom under her bed to buy food. These and other circum-\r\nstances are detailed in sections of the Sultan report and\r\ndeposition reproduced in the Appendix, infra.\r\n                              2\r\n   The panel also responded unanimously and affirma-\r\ntively to the second question: Would federal-court access to\r\nthe Sultan documents likely have made a significant\r\ndifference in respect to the federal legal question at issue\r\nin Thompson\u2019s habeas petition, namely, the failure of\r\nThompson\u2019s trial counsel to investigate his background?\r\nTrial counsel had had important indications that some-\r\nthing was wrong. Indeed, counsel himself had sought an\r\nevaluation of Thompson\u2019s mental condition. He also was\r\naware of Thompson\u2019s violent behavior in the military, and\r\nknew that Thompson had said he had had auditory hallu-\r\ncinations all his life. He was aware, too, of the changes in\r\nThompson\u2019s behavior. Should counsel not then have\r\ninvestigated further?\r\n   The Sultan documents make clear that, had he done so,\r\nhe would have had a strong answer to the State\u2019s experts.\r\nThus the documents were relevant to the outcome of the\r\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)            9\r\n\r\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nfederal habeas proceedings. The Federal District Court\r\nbased its grant of summary judgment on the premise that\r\nthere was no evidence supporting Thompson\u2019s claim. The\r\ndocuments showed that precisely such evidence was then\r\navailable.\r\n                                3\r\n   The panel (while disagreeing about how to allocate\r\nblame) agreed in part about the answer to the third ques-\r\ntion: how these documents previously had escaped the\r\npanel\u2019s attention. The judges agreed that the Sultan\r\ndocuments were not in the initial record on appeal. The\r\npanel\u2019s original opinion, while mentioning both Dr. Sultan\r\nand Dr. Crown, assumed that neither expert had ad-\r\ndressed Thompson\u2019s mental condition at the time of the\r\ncrime. 315 F. 3d, at 583, n. 13 (\u201cSultan\u2019s affidavit does not\r\ndiscuss Thompson\u2019s mental state at the time of the offense\u201d\r\n(emphasis added)); ibid. (explaining that Thompson filed a\r\nRule 60(b) motion to supplement the record with Dr.\r\nSultan\u2019s report, but not mentioning that the report ad-\r\ndressed Thompson\u2019s mental condition at the time of the\r\noffense); see also supra, at 5.\r\n   How had the panel overlooked the copies of the Sultan\r\ndeposition attached to (1) the rehearing petition and (2)\r\nthe (Rule 60(b)-related) motion to hold the appeal in abey-\r\nance? As for the rehearing petition, the reason could well\r\nlie in the petition\u2019s (incorrect) suggestion that the panel\r\nhad already considered the appended document as part of\r\nthe original record. See Pet. for Rehearing and Suggestion\r\nfor Rehearing En Banc in No. 2:00\u20135516 (CA6), p. 1 (\u201cA\r\nmajority of this panel overlooked other proof in the record,\r\nincluding but not limited to, the expert opinion of Dr. Faye\r\nE. Sultan\u201d); see also id., at 28\u201332. While the petition\r\nexplains the importance of the documents, it does not\r\nexplain the circumstances, namely, that the panel previ-\r\nously had not seen these documents. Instead, it gives the\r\n10                  BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nimpression that counsel was simply reemphasizing a\r\nmatter the panel had already considered. To that extent,\r\nthe petition reduced the likelihood that the panel would\r\nmake the connection it later made and fatally weakened\r\nits argument for re-hearing.\r\n   As for the motion to hold the appeal in abeyance, the\r\npanel\u2019s failure to recognize the significance of the ap-\r\npended Sultan materials is also understandable. The\r\nmotion gives the impression that the appellate court\r\nwould have been able to handle any problem arising from\r\nthe exclusion of these materials in an appeal taken from\r\nthe District Court\u2019s Rule 60(b) decision. The appellate\r\ncourt, however, never had any such opportunity because\r\ncounsel did not appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of the\r\nRule 60(b) motion.\r\n                               C\r\n  Once the panel understood the significance of the Sultan\r\nreport, it had to decide what to do. An appellate court\r\nexists to correct legal errors made in the trial court. What\r\nlegal error had the District Court committed? The appeal\r\nconcerned its grant of summary judgment in the State\u2019s\r\nfavor. The District Court made that decision on the basis\r\nof the record before it, and that record apparently lacked\r\nthe relevant documents. How then could an appeals court\r\nsay that the District Court was wrong to grant the sum-\r\nmary judgment motion?\r\n  The panel answered this question by not holding that\r\nthe District Court had erred. Finding that the Sultan\r\ndocuments had been \u201capparently negligently omitted\u201d\r\nfrom the record, it exercised its equitable powers to sup-\r\nplement the record with the deposition. 373 F. 3d, at 691.\r\nIt also found that, since the State itself had helped to\r\ncreate that document (because the State had taken Sul-\r\ntan\u2019s deposition), the District Court\u2019s reconsideration of\r\nthe matter would not unfairly prejudice the State. And it\r\n                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           11\r\n\r\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nnoted that this case is a death case. Then, relying on its\r\n\u201cinherent power to reconsider\u201d an opinion \u201cprior to the\r\nissuance of the mandate,\u201d the court issued a new opinion,\r\nvacating the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment\r\nto the State and remanding the case to the District Court\r\nfor further proceedings on the matter. Ibid.\r\n                             II\r\n    The question before us is not whether we, as judges,\r\nwould have come to the same conclusions as did the panel\r\nof the Court of Appeals. It is whether the three members\r\nof the appellate panel abused their discretion in reconsid-\r\nering the matter and, after agreeing unanimously that\r\nthey would have reached a different result had they con-\r\nsidered the overlooked evidence, vacating the District\r\nCourt\u2019s judgment and remanding the case.\r\n   The Court concludes that the panel\u2019s reconsideration of\r\nthe matter and decision to vacate the District Court\u2019s\r\njudgment amounted to an \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d Ante, at 1.\r\nIt therefore reverses the panel\u2019s unanimous interlocutory\r\njudgment remanding a capital case to the District Court\r\nfor an evidentiary hearing. The Court lists five reasons\r\nwhy the Court of Appeals \u201cabused its discretion.\u201d None of\r\nthese reasons, whether taken separately or considered\r\ntogether, stands up to examination.\r\n   Reason One. During the 5-month period after this Court\r\ndenied rehearing of Thompson\u2019s certiorari petition, during\r\nwhich time the Court of Appeals was reconsidering the\r\nmatter, it gave \u201cno indication that it might be revisiting its\r\nearlier decision.\u201d Had it \u201cnotified\u201d the parties, the court\r\n\u201ccould have spared the parties and the state judicial system\r\nconsiderable time and resources.\u201d Ante, at 10.\r\n   If this consideration favors the Court\u2019s conclusion, it\r\ndoes so to a very modest degree. For one thing, the Fed-\r\neral Rules themselves neither set an unchangeable dead-\r\nline for issuance of a mandate nor require notice when the\r\n12                  BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ncourt enlarges the time for issuance. Compare Fed. Rule\r\nApp. Proc. 41(b) (2005) (\u201cThe court may shorten or extend\r\nthe time\u201d), with Rule 41(b) (1968) (mandate \u201cshall\u201d issue\r\n\u201cunless the time is shortened or extended by order\u201d (em-\r\nphasis added)). The Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 41\r\nexpressly contemplate that the parties will themselves\r\ncheck the docket to determine whether the mandate has\r\nissued. See Advisory Committee\u2019s 1998 Note on subd. (c)\r\nof Rule 41 (\u201c[T]he parties can easily calculate the antici-\r\npated date of issuance and verify issuance of the man-\r\ndate[;] the entry of the order on the docket alerts the\r\nparties to that fact\u201d). And Sixth Circuit Rules require the\r\nCircuit Clerk to provide all parties with copies of the\r\nmandate. See Internal Operating Procedure 41(a) (CA6\r\n2005) (\u201cCopies of the mandate are distributed to all parties\r\nand the district court clerk\u2019s office\u201d). Thus, the State\u2019s\r\nattorneys knew, or certainly should have known, that the\r\nmandate had not issued, and, as experienced practitioners,\r\nthey also knew, or certainly should have known, that a\r\nproceeding is not technically over until the court has\r\nissued its mandate. And if concerned by the delay (and\r\nsome delay in such matters is not uncommon), they could\r\nhave asked the Circuit Clerk why the mandate had not\r\nissued. If necessary, they could have filed a motion seek-\r\ning that information or seeking the mandate\u2019s immediate\r\nissuance.\r\n  For another thing, since notification is a clerical duty,\r\nthe panel may have thought the parties had been notified.\r\nOne of the judges on the panel could well have instructed\r\nthe Circuit Clerk not to issue the mandate, and then\r\nsimply have assumed that the Clerk would notify the\r\nparties of that fact (though the Clerk, perhaps inadver-\r\ntently, did not do so). Why would the court want to hide\r\nwhat it was doing from the parties? Once we apply a\r\npresumption of regularity to the panel\u2019s actions, we must\r\nassume that the failure to notify the parties was likely due\r\n                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           13\r\n\r\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nto a simple clerical error.\r\n   Further, the prejudice to the State that troubles the\r\nCourt was likely small or nonexistent. The need to reset\r\nan execution date is not uncommon, and the state court\u2019s\r\nexecution order explicitly foresaw that possibility. See 373\r\nF. 3d, at 692 (Tennessee Supreme Court order set Thomp-\r\nson\u2019s execution date for August 19, 2004, \u201cunless other-\r\nwise ordered by this Court or other appropriate authority\u201d\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). Moreover, the State\r\nhas not even argued\u2014despite ample opportunity to do\r\nso\u2014that the further proceedings ordered by the panel\r\nwould actually have required it to set a new date.\r\n   Finally, the State did not, by way of a petition for re-\r\nhearing, make any of its \u201cfailure to notify\u201d arguments to\r\nthe Court of Appeals. Although the law does not require\r\nthe State to seek rehearing, such a petition would have\r\npermitted the panel to explain why the State was not\r\nnotified and possibly to explore the matter of prejudice.\r\nThere is no reason to reward the State for not filing a\r\npetition by assuming prejudice where none appears to\r\nexist.\r\n   Given the State\u2019s likely knowledge that the mandate\r\nhad not issued, the existence of avenues for resolving any\r\nuncertainty, and the small likelihood of prejudice, the lack\r\nof notice does not significantly advance the Court\u2019s \u201cabuse\r\nof discretion\u201d finding. Indeed, if the Court believes that\r\nthe Court of Appeals could have issued a revised opinion\r\ncorrecting its earlier judgment if only it had given notice to\r\nthe parties, the sanction it now imposes\u2014outright rever-\r\nsal\u2014is far out of proportion to the crime.\r\n   Reason Two. The court\u2019s \u201copportunity to consider\u201d the\r\nSultan evidence \u201cat the rehearing stage is yet another\r\nfactor supporting\u201d the abuse-of-discretion \u201cdetermination.\u201d\r\nAnte, at 12. I agree that it is unfortunate that, upon\r\nreview of the rehearing petition, the panel failed to make\r\nthe connection that would have allowed it, at that time, to\r\n14                   BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nreach the same conclusion it reached later. Still, the\r\npetition wrongly implied that the Sultan documents were\r\npart of the original appeal. Because it did not request\r\nrehearing on the ground that the documents were not in\r\nthe record, it did not offer a genuine \u201copportunity to con-\r\nsider\u201d the Sultan evidence.\r\n   Under these circumstances, I cannot agree that the\r\ncourt\u2019s opportunity to consider these documents at the\r\nrehearing stage should militate in favor of finding an\r\nabuse of discretion. To the contrary, I believe we should\r\nencourage, rather than discourage, an appellate panel,\r\nwhen it learns that it has made a serious mistake, to take\r\nadvantage of an opportunity to correct it, rather than to\r\nignore the problem.\r\n   Reason Three. The \u201cSultan evidence . . . is not of such a\r\ncharacter as to warrant [a] . . . departure from standard\r\nappellate procedures\u201d because \u201cthe evidence was unlikely to\r\nhave altered the District Court\u2019s resolution of Thompson\u2019s\r\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.\u201d Ante, at 14. That\r\nis to say, given the expert testimony in the trial court, the\r\nSultan evidence is unlikely meaningfully to have strength-\r\nened Thompson\u2019s claim before the Federal District Court.\r\nAnte, at 14\u201315.\r\n   This conclusion is wrong. The Court argues the follow-\r\ning: (1) Dr. Sultan\u2019s conclusion rests in significant part\r\nupon interviews with three witnesses, Thompson\u2019s grand-\r\nmother and sister (with whom Dr. Sultan spoke directly)\r\nand his girlfriend (whose interview with a defense investi-\r\ngator Dr. Sultan reviewed); (2) since all three of these\r\nwitnesses testified at sentencing, Thompson\u2019s counsel\r\nmust have consulted them at the time; and (3)\r\n\u201c[c]onsultation with these witnesses, when combined with\r\nthe opinions of [the State\u2019s expert] and [Thompson\u2019s ex-\r\npert], provided an adequate basis for Thompson\u2019s attor-\r\nneys to conclude that focusing on Thompson\u2019s mental\r\nhealth was not the best strategy.\u201d Ante, at 16. The Court\r\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)          15\r\n\r\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nthen says that trial counsel\u2019s \u201cstrategy\u201d may have been \u201ca\r\nmistake,\u201d ante, at 17, but apparently not enough of a\r\nmistake to amount to inadequate assistance of counsel.\r\n   But how do the Court\u2019s conclusions follow from the\r\npremises? Dr. Sultan\u2019s interview of the three witnesses\r\napparently turned up new information, indeed, crucial\r\ninformation. Why does that fact not tend show that trial\r\ncounsel\u2019s own \u201cconsultation\u201d with those witnesses was\r\ninadequate? Or, if trial counsel was aware of the informa-\r\ntion, why does that not tend to show that trial counsel\r\nhired an expert who was not qualified to assess Thomp-\r\nson\u2019s mental condition, or that counsel failed adequately to\r\nconvey the critical information to that expert? This Court\r\nin Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 523\u2013525 (2003), found\r\ntrial counsel inadequate for failing to conduct a reasonable\r\ninvestigation, given notice that such an investigation\r\nwould likely turn up important mitigating evidence. See\r\nalso Rompilla v. Beard, ante, p. ___. Why is the same not\r\ntrue here, where Thompson\u2019s trial counsel was fully aware\r\nof the need for a background investigation, and then either\r\ndid not ask the right questions, or did not hire the right\r\nexpert, or did not convey the right information to that\r\nexpert? At the least, is there not a good argument to this\r\neffect\u2014an argument that the Sultan documents signifi-\r\ncantly strengthened? All three judges on the panel\r\nthought so: They concluded that they would have reached\r\na different result on Thompson\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-\r\ncounsel claim had they been aware of the Sultan docu-\r\nments. The Court does not satisfactorily explain its basis\r\nfor second-guessing the panel on this point.\r\n   Reason Four. The Sultan evidence does \u201cnot come close\r\nto satisfying the miscarriage of justice standard under\r\nCalderon.\u201d Ante, at 17 (referring to Calderon v. Thomp-\r\nson, 523 U. S. 538 (1998)). As the Court apparently\r\nagrees, see ante, at 8\u20139, Calderon does not apply here.\r\nAnd the panel\u2019s basic conclusion\u2014that consideration of\r\n16                   BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nThompson\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim with-\r\nout the benefit of the Sultan evidence would constitute a\r\ngrave miscarriage of justice\u2014survives any plausible stan-\r\ndard of review. I can find nothing in the Court\u2019s opinion\r\nthat explains why the panel\u2019s conclusion is wrong.\r\n   Reason Five. The Court of Appeals \u201cdid not accord the\r\nappropriate level of respect\u201d to the State\u2019s \u201cjudgment.\u201d\r\nAnte, at 19. If by \u201cjudgment\u201d the Court means to refer to\r\nthe state court\u2019s original judgment of conviction, this\r\nreason simply repeats Reason Four. The panel carefully\r\nexamined the entire record and determined that there is a\r\nsignificant likelihood the Sultan evidence would demon-\r\nstrate a violation of the Federal Constitution.\r\n   If the Court means to refer to the state court\u2019s judgment\r\nnot to set aside the conviction in state postconviction\r\nproceedings, the Court is clearly wrong. The state court\r\non collateral review refused to authorize funds for a back-\r\nground investigation, one for which Thompson\u2019s expert\r\nthen showed a strong need, and which Thompson\u2019s expert\r\nnow shows could well have demonstrated a significantly\r\nmitigating mental condition. How is it disrespectful of the\r\nState for a federal habeas court to identify a constitutional\r\nerror that occurred in state-court proceedings in a capital\r\ncase, by taking account of a key piece of evidence, mistak-\r\nenly omitted from the record?\r\n   If the Court means to refer to the State\u2019s decision to\r\nproceed with the execution, I cannot possibly agree. The\r\nCourt could not mean that any exercise by a federal court\r\nto correct an inadvertent, and important, evidentiary error\r\nis \u201cdisrespectful\u201d of a State\u2019s effort to proceed to execution.\r\nBut if it does not mean \u201cany\u201d exercise at all, then how can\r\nit say the present exercise is disrespectful? The present\r\nexercise embodies as thorough an examination of the\r\nrecord and as significant a piece of evidence as one is\r\nlikely to find. The process\u2014the detail and care with which\r\nthe Court of Appeals combed the record\u2014does not show\r\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           17\r\n\r\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n\u201cdisrespect.\u201d It shows the contrary.\r\n  The upshot is that the Court\u2019s five reasons are uncon-\r\nvincing. The Court simply states those reasons as conclu-\r\nsions. It fails to show how, or why, the unanimous panel\r\nerred in reaching diametrically opposite conclusions, all\r\nsupported with detailed evidence set forth in Judge Suhr-\r\nheinrich\u2019s opinion. It does not satisfactorily explain the\r\nevidentiary basis for its own conclusions. And, in the\r\nprocess, it loses sight of the question before us: again, not\r\nwhether we, as judges, would have reached the same\r\nconclusion that the three judges on the panel reached, but\r\nrather whether they, having unanimously agreed that\r\ntheir earlier decision was wrong, abused their discretion in\r\nsetting it right.\r\n                             III\r\n  Ultimately this case presents three kinds of question.\r\nThe first is a narrow legal question. Has the Court of\r\nAppeals abused its discretion? For the reasons I have set\r\nforth, the answer to that question, legally speaking, must\r\nbe \u201cno.\u201d\r\n  The second is an epistemological question. How, in\r\nrespect to matters involving the legal impact of the Sultan\r\nreport and deposition, can the Court replace the panel\u2019s\r\njudgment with its own? Judge Suhrheinrich\u2019s opinion\r\ndemonstrates why any assessment of that legal impact\r\nmust grow out of thorough knowledge of the record. He\r\nspent hundreds of hours with its numerous documents in\r\norder to make that assessment. Those of his conclusions\r\nthat were shared by the other members of the panel are\r\nlogical, rest upon record-based facts, and are nowhere\r\nrefuted (in respect to those facts) by anything before us or\r\nby anything in the Court\u2019s opinion. How can the Court\r\nknow that the panel is wrong?\r\n  The third question is about basic jurisprudence. A legal\r\nsystem is based on rules; it also seeks justice in the indi-\r\n18                   BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nvidual case. Sometimes these ends conflict. To take ac-\r\ncount of such conflict, the system often grants judges a\r\ndegree of discretion, thereby providing oil for the rule-\r\nbased gears. When we tell the Court of Appeals that it\r\ncannot exercise its discretion to correct the serious error it\r\ndiscovered here, we tell courts they are not to act to cure\r\nserious injustice in similar cases. The consequence is to\r\ndivorce the rule-based result from the just result. The\r\nAmerican judicial system has long sought to avoid that\r\ndivorce. Today\u2019s decision takes an unfortunate step in the\r\nwrong direction.\r\n                 Cite as: 545 U.

Sultan at the River-\r\n    bend Maximum Security Institution (RMSI) (July 22,\r\n    1999), App. 11\u201320.\r\n\r\n\u201cREFERRAL QUESTIONS:\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Gregory Thompson was referred for psychological\r\nevaluation in July, 1998 by attorney Mr. Stephen M.\r\nKissinger of the Federal Defender Services of Eastern\r\nTennessee Incorporated. Mr. Thompson was convicted of\r\nmurder in 1985. This evaluation was requested to address\r\nthe following questions:\r\n    \u201c1. Mr. Thompson\u2019s current psychological status[.]\r\n    \u201c2. Mr. Thompson\u2019s likely psychological status and\r\n    mental state before and surrounding the time of the\r\n    1985 offense.\r\n    \u201c3. Social, environmental, psychological, and economic\r\n    factors in the life of Mr. Thompson which might have\r\n    be[en] considered to be mitigating in nature at the\r\n    time of his trial.\r\n\u201cPROCEDURE:\r\n\u201cPsychological evaluation of Mr. Thompson was initiated\r\non August 20, 1998. This first evaluation session extended\r\nover a period of approximately four hours and consisted of\r\nclinical interview and the administration of the Minnesota\r\nMultiphasic Personality Inventory\u20132 (MMPI\u20132). Some\r\nreview of prior psychological evaluation records was con-\r\nducted to establish what formal psychological and neuro-\r\npsychological testing had been administered to Mr.\r\nThompson. Levels of current intellectual and neuropsy-\r\nchological functioning had been recently assessed by neu-\r\nropsychologist, Barry Crown, Ph.D., so no attempt was\r\n20                  BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n               Appendix to opinion of BREYER, J.\r\n\r\nmade to replicate this type of assessment.\r\n\u201cFollowing the 8\u201320\u201398 initial evaluation session, a very\r\nextensive review of legal, military, medical, prison and\r\npsychiatric/psychological records was initiated. A list of\r\nthe documents examined is attached to this report.\r\n      .          .            .            .          .\r\n\u201c. . . Two further interviews were conducted with Mr.\r\nThompson for [the] limited purpose [of determining\r\nThompson\u2019s competence to participate in habeas proceed-\r\nings], on 2\u20132\u201399 and 4\u20137\u201399, totaling approximately six\r\nhours of additional observation. Voluminous Tennessee\r\nDepartment of Corrections mental health, medical, and\r\nadministrative records were reviewed at this time as well.\r\n      .          .            .            .          .\r\n\u201c[T]he extensive record review conducted, the ten hours of\r\nclinical observations made of Mr. Thompson during the\r\npreceding eleven months, the interviews conducted with\r\ncollateral informants, and the recent and past psychologi-\r\ncal testing which had been administered provide enough\r\ndata to make it possible to render professional opinions\r\nabout Mr. Thompson\u2019s mental state at and around the\r\ntime of the 1985 offense.\r\n\u201cCLINICAL OBSERVATIONS:\r\n\u201cMr. Gregory Thompson was cooperative with the assess-\r\nment procedure. He answered all questions posed to him\r\nand appeared to be alert, watchful and interested in the\r\ninterview process. His speech was sometimes tangential\r\nand rambling. Although motor behavior appeared con-\r\ntrolled there was a manic quality to his verbalizations.\r\nMr. Thompson was oriented as to person, place and time,\r\nbut he repeatedly expressed his firm belief that he had\r\nwritten each and every song which played on the radio.\r\n\u201cMr. Thompson displayed symptoms of psychosis during\r\nthe two subsequent meetings. The details of these ses-\r\nsions will not be reviewed here.\r\n                 Cite as: 545 U.

It had been determined in other examination settings\r\nthat Mr. Thompson\u2019s level of reading competence exceeded\r\nthe necessary level of 8th grade ability required for proper\r\nadministration of this test.\r\n\u201cThe MMPI\u20132 profile produced by Mr. Thompson is con-\r\nsidered valid and appropriate for interpretation. Indi-\r\nviduals producing similar profiles are described as experi-\r\nencing significant psychological difficulties and chronic\r\npsychological maladjustment. Such individuals are con-\r\nsidered to be highly suspicious of others, often displaying\r\nparanoid features. There is indication in this profile of the\r\npresence of a thought disorder and the inability to manage\r\nemotions. The world is perceived as a threatening and\r\ndangerous place and fears are viewed as externally gener-\r\nated and reality-based rather than as a product of an\r\ninternally generated state. The behavior of such individu-\r\nals is often described as hostile, aggressive, and rebellious\r\nagainst authority. Poor impulse control, lack of trust in\r\nothers, and low frustration tolerance may result in such\r\nindividuals displaying rage in interpersonal relationships.\r\n\u201cIndividuals producing this testing profile are also de-\r\nscribed as experiencing depressed mood. There is the\r\nstrong possibility that such individuals have contemplated\r\nsuicide and report preoccupation with feeling guilty and\r\nunworthy. Testing items were endorsed which suggest\r\nmemory and concentration problems, and an inability to\r\nmake decisions.\r\n\u201cRELEVANT PSYCHOLOGICAL/PSYCHIATRIC DATA\r\nCONTAINED IN RECORDS:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe[re] is substantial documentation throughout the\r\n\r\nTennessee Department of Corrections records that Mr.\r\n\r\nGreg Thompson has suffered from significant mental\r\n\r\n22                   BELL v.

He has been treated almost continuously with some\r\ncombination of major tranquilizer and/or anti-depressant\r\nand/or anti-anxiety medications. He has received a vari-\r\nety of diagnostic labels including Psychosis, Psychosis Not\r\nOtherwise Specified, Paranoid Schizophrenia, Mania,\r\nMixed Substance Abuse, Schizophrenia, BiPolar Affective\r\nDisorder, Schizoaffective Disorder, Malingering, and Adult\r\nAntisocial Behavior. This is clearly indicative of the Ten-\r\nnessee DOC mental health staff\u2019s view that Mr. Thompson\r\nhas experienced major mental illness throughout at least\r\nmost of his period of incarceration. Further, there is\r\nextensive documentation contained in these records of\r\nmany episodes of bizarre aggressive and/or self-destructive\r\nbehavior.\r\n\u201cINTERVIEWS WITH COLLATERAL WITNESSES:\r\n\u201cFive individuals were interviewed (either by telephone or\r\nface-to-face) who provided significant supplemental infor-\r\nmation about the life circumstances and past/present\r\npsychological functioning of Mr. Gregory Thompson.\r\n\u201cMs. Maybelle Lamar\r\n\u201cMs. Lamar is Mr. Thompson\u2019s maternal grandmother.\r\nShe was interviewed by telephone on July 21, 1999. Ms.\r\nLamar assumed total responsibility for the care and rear-\r\ning of Mr. Thompson and his two older siblings after his\r\nmother was killed when Mr. Thompson was approximately\r\nfive years old. Mr. Thompson remained in her home until\r\nhe entered the military as a young adult.\r\n\u201cMs. Lamar recalls the period following her daughter\u2019s\r\nfatal automobile accident as one of tremendous strain and\r\ndisruption for her. She was unable to describe the reac-\r\ntion of the three young children to their mother\u2019s death\r\nbecause she \u2018took to my bed\u2019 for approximately five or six\r\nweeks following the accident. Ms. Lamar was unable to\r\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)          23\r\n\r\n               Appendix to opinion of BREYER, J.\r\n\r\nattend to these children in any way at that time. She did\r\nnot recall how they obtained food or clothing, or whether\r\nthey were in any distress. Ms. Lamar reported that she\r\nwas drinking alcohol quite heavily during this period and\r\nthat she left her bed to resume household activities only\r\nbecause the children contracted a serious medical illness.\r\n\u201cMs. Lamar described Mr. Thompson as displaying signifi-\r\ncantly \u2018different\u2019 behavior when he returned to visit her\r\nfollowing his discharge from the U. S. Navy. \u2018Greg didn\u2019t\r\nact the same\u2019. Unlike the \u2018eager to please\u2019, passive, some-\r\ntimes funny, gentle boy who she had reared, Mr. Thomp-\r\nson was \u2018angry\u2019, \u2018sometimes sad\u2019. \u2018I don\u2019t think he wanted\r\nme to know what was going on with him. He mostly just\r\nstayed away from me.\u2019 Ms. Lamar reported that she no-\r\nticed Mr. Thompson sometimes \u2018staring off into space\u2019 or\r\n\u2018talking to himself \u2019. She would ask him about these be-\r\nhaviors. \u2018He\u2019d deny it. He acted like he didn\u2019t know what\r\nI was talking about.\u2019 Ms. Lamar recalls being quite con-\r\ncerned about her grandson\u2019s mental state during this time.\r\nShe did not recall ever being asked these questions at any\r\ntime before or during Mr. Thompson\u2019s trial.\r\n\u201cMs. Nora Jean Hall Wharton\r\n\u201cNora Jean Wharton is Mr. Thompson\u2019s older sister. A\r\nlengthy telephone interview was conducted with her on\r\nJuly 21, 1999. She grew up in the same home as Mr.\r\nThompson and had continuous contact with him through-\r\nout his childhood. Mr. Thompson lived briefly in the home\r\nof his sister following his discharge from the military.\r\n\u201cMs. Wharton described Mr. Greg Thompson as a highly\r\nsensitive, passive, timid, emotionally vulnerable child.\r\nShe described a childhood of great hardship. According to\r\nher report, their grandmother, Ms. Maybelle Lamar[,] was\r\nverbally abusive, neglectful of the children\u2019s basic daily\r\nneeds, highly critical, and unable to care properly for the\r\nchildren. Ms. Wharton described many instances of such\r\n24                   BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of BREYER, J.\r\n\r\nabuse and neglect. She described the period following\r\ntheir mother\u2019s death as particularly chaotic and neglectful,\r\nrecalling that often there was no food in the home and\r\nthat the children would take money from under their\r\ngrandmother\u2019s mattress to go and buy food. In the period\r\nfollowing their mother\u2019s death, Ms. Wharton reported that\r\nher grandmother was continuously drunk and unable to\r\ncare for her grandchildren. According to Ms. Wharton,\r\nGreg Thompson frequently witnessed his sister Nora being\r\nbeaten by their grandmother.\r\n\u201cMs. Wharton further recalled that she and her younger\r\nbrother had witnessed the brutal beating and rape of their\r\nmother by their biological father. She recalls Greg stand-\r\ning in the scene screaming and sobbing uncontrollably.\r\n\u201cMs. Wharton reported that Greg would frequently cry at\r\nschool during the early school years, and, as a result, was\r\noften the victim of intense mockery from his classmates.\r\nBecause Ms. Wharton was in the same classroom as her\r\nbrother she observed these behaviors and often intervened\r\non her brother\u2019s behalf. She described Mr. Thompson\u2019s\r\nresponse to this abuse as quite passive.\r\n\u201cOf particular significance is Ms. Wharton\u2019s recollections\r\nabout Mr. Thompson repeatedly banging his head against\r\nthe wall of their home on many occasions during their\r\nearly childhood. This behavior frequently followed their\r\ngrandmother yelling at Greg \u2018You have the Devil in you.\u2019\r\nMr. Thompson would tell his sister that he was attempt-\r\ning to \u2018knock the Devil out\u2019 of his head in this way. Ms.\r\nWharton recalls believing that this behavior was quite\r\nodd.\r\n\u201cFollowing his discharge from military service, Ms. Whar-\r\nton described Mr. Thompson\u2019s behavior as significantly\r\ndifferent than his prior conduct and attitude. She re-\r\nported several episodes of bizarre behavior which included\r\na sudden intense emotional reaction without obvious\r\nexternal provocation. Mr. Thompson would become ex-\r\n                 Cite as: 545 U.

Ms. Thompson reported this behavior\r\nand her concerns about it to her grandmother. Ms. Lamar\r\nsuggested that Ms. Wharton take her brother to the psy-\r\nchiatric unit of the local hospital for treatment. Ms.\r\nWharton did not attempt to get any treatment for Mr.\r\nThompson and reports feeling quite guilty about this.\r\n\u201cNora Jean Wharton described her own struggles with\r\nmental illness throughout the past fifteen years. She has\r\nreceived counseling to assist her in coping with the effects\r\nof her abusive childhood and she has been treated with a\r\ncombination of a major tranquilizer (Stellazine) and anti-\r\ndepressant medications. She reported that her younger\r\nhalf-sister Kim has also suffered from significant mental\r\nillness.\r\n\u201cCUSTODY OFFICERS AT RMSI\r\n\u201cFollowing the second interview conducted with Mr.\r\nThompson on 2\u20132\u201399, I informally interviewed two cus-\r\ntody officers who escorted Mr. Thompson back to his cell.\r\nThese officers have not as yet been identified by name.\r\nBoth reported that they were aware that Mr. Thompson\r\nwas quite mentally ill and that they were concerned about\r\nhim. They further reported that they believed it would be\r\nin his best interest to be housed in a prison facility better\r\nequipped to deal with individuals experiencing severe\r\nmental illness.\r\n\u201cMICHAEL CHAVIS\r\n\u201cFederal Defender Services of Eastern Tennessee investi-\r\ngator, Mr. Michael Chavis, was interviewed about his July\r\n29 through August 2, 1998 interview with Ms. Arlene\r\nCajulao in Honolulu, Hawaii. Ms. Cajulao and Mr.\r\nThompson had an intimate relationship and lived together\r\n26                  BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n               Appendix to opinion of BREYER, J.\r\n\r\nfor approximately four years, from 1980 to 1984.\r\n\u201cMr. Chavis reported that Ms. Cajulao described Mr.\r\nThompson as displaying increasingly bizarre behavior\r\nduring the latter part of their relationship. Similar to\r\ndescriptions proved by Ms. Nora Wharton, Ms. Cajulao\r\nreported several episodes of \u2018paranoid\u2019 and aggressive\r\nbehavior which had no apparent external antecedent. She\r\nreported that Mr. Thompson sometimes thought that\r\npeople were \u2018after\u2019 him. He would close all the curtains in\r\nthe house because he did not want the person who was\r\n\u2018looking\u2019 for him to see him through the curtains. She\r\nremembers being quite concerned about Mr. Thompson\u2019s\r\nmental state.\r\n\u201cSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS:\r\n\u201cMr. Gregory Thompson has experienced symptoms of\r\nmajor mental illness throughout his adult life. Indeed,\r\nthere is information available which suggests that Mr.\r\nThompson was displaying significant signs of mental\r\nillness from the time he was a small child. Self-injurious\r\nbehavior is reported as early as six years old. There is\r\nextensive documentation contained within the records\r\nreviewed for this evaluation that Mr. Thompson has ex-\r\nperienced a thought disorder and/or an affective disorder\r\nof some type for many years.\r\n\u201cIt is my opinion that Mr. Gregory Thompson is most\r\nappropriately diagnosed, according to the Diagnostic and\r\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, as\r\nhaving Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type. As is\r\ntypical of this illness, symptoms became apparent in early\r\nadulthood. Mr. Thompson was suffering serious mental\r\nillness at the time of the 1985 offense for which he has\r\nbeen convicted and sentenced. This mental illness would\r\nhave substantially impaired Mr. Thompson\u2019s ability to\r\nconform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\r\n\u201cFurther, Mr. Thompson was the victim of severe child-\r\n                 Cite as: 545 U.

His family\r\nbackground is best described as highly neglectful and \r\n\r\neconomically deprived. Mr. Thompson repeatedly wit\r\n        -\r\nnessed episodes of violence during his childhood in which \r\n\r\none family member assaulted or brutalized another. \r\n\r\nThere are significant aspects of Mr. Thompson\u2019s social\r\n\r\nhistory that have been recognized as mitigating in other \r\n\r\ncapital cases \r\n\r\n\u201cIt is important to note that all of the information related \r\n\r\nto Mr. Thompson\u2019s early mental illness and social history \r\n\r\nwas available at the time of his 1985 trial. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u201c[signed]\r\n\r\n\u201cFaye E. Sultan, Ph.D.\u201d \r\n\r\n\r\n                         *     *      *\r\n\r\n    Excerpts from the Deposition of Dr. Faye E. Sultan\r\n    (July 22, 1999), Id., at 71\u201373, 76\u201380.\r\n   \u201cQ. What indicates to you or what indicia are there for\r\nyou that suggest Mr. Thompson was displaying significant\r\nsigns of mental illness from the time he was a small child?\r\nHow do you arrive at that conclusion?\r\n   \u201cA. .            .            .           .            .\r\n   \u201cBy the time of the first grade, Mr. Thompson, when he\r\nwas being yelled at by his grandmother, she was report-\r\nedly verbally abusive in the following fashion: She would\r\nyell at him you have the devil in you, boy. [His sister, Ms.\r\nWharton] would then observe Mr. Thompson standing or\r\nsitting beside a wall repeatedly banging his head into the\r\nwall. She, in her role as protector of him, would ask him\r\nwhat was going on, and he would tell her he was trying to\r\nknock the devil out of his head. She recalls at the time,\r\nalthough she was quite young herself, being worried about\r\nhis behavior and thinking of it as very odd.\r\n28                   BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of BREYER, J.\r\n\r\n     .            .           .             .           .\r\n   \u201cQ. Sort of a self-punishment or a self-exorcism type\r\nthing?\r\n   \u201cA. A self-injurious behavior is what we would call it I\r\nthink. Mr. Thompson, when he was Greg, in the first and\r\nsecond and third grade had rather frequent hysterical\r\ncrying episodes in classrooms that Ms. Wharton recalls\r\nalso as very unusual in the context of his schoolroom\r\nsituation. She describes him as being the subject of tor-\r\nment on the part of the students because he behaved in an\r\nodd fashion. Sometimes he would simply begin to cry and\r\nwail and scream and apparently made a sound like a fire\r\nengine when he was sobbing and developed the nickname\r\nFire Engine. That\u2019s reported in the trial transcript. She\r\ntold me much more detail about actually the extent of\r\nthose kind[s] of emotional outbursts.\r\n   \u201cAt home it was rather common for Mr. Thompson to\r\nbegin to cry and scream during times when Ms. Wharton\r\nherself was being beaten by their grandmother. Ms.\r\nWharton was the victim of physical abuse on the part of\r\nthe grandmother. Mr. Thompson observed much of this\r\nsince they were together virtually all of the time, and Nora\r\nWharton was not really permitted much interaction out-\r\nside of their home.\r\n     .            .           .             .           .\r\n   \u201cQ. Your diagnosis for Mr. Thompson is schizoaffective\r\ndisorder, comma, bipolar type. What leads you to that\r\ndiagnosis from what you\u2019ve reviewed and your testing\r\nresults?\r\n   \u201cA. What leads me to the diagnosis is that there is a\r\nlong history, perhaps at this point almost a 20-year his-\r\ntory, of simultaneous thought disorder on the part of Mr.\r\nThompson documented throughout all the records, and\r\naffective disorder, emotional disorder, being unable to\r\nregulate his emotions, sometimes falling into the pits of\r\ndespair and becoming suicidal, sometimes becoming\r\n                 Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           29\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of BREYER, J.\r\n\r\nhighly agitated and manic and having too much energy,\r\ntoo much exuberance, and grandiose thinking.             The\r\nthought disorder is manifested in persecutory ideas, delu-\r\nsions of grandeur\u2014lots of different kinds of delusions\r\nactually\u2014auditory hallucinations that he sometimes\r\nadmits to, sometimes suspected by the doctors who are\r\ndoing the examination.\r\n   \u201cThe psychological testing early on in Mr. Thompson\u2019s\r\nincarceration confirm[s] the presence of a psychotic proc-\r\ness. There was an MMPI administered to him by a prison\r\npsychologist in 1990 that is described as valid and indica-\r\ntive of psychotic process, and throughout the prison record\r\nhe receives a variety of diagnoses that take into account\r\nboth thought disorder and affective illness.\r\n   \u201cThe very best diagnosis to describe all of the complex of\r\nsymptoms that I just talked to you about is schizoaffective\r\ndisorder, bipolar type.\r\n   \u201cQ. You note in your report Mr. Thompson was ob-\r\nserved having a significant change in behavior after he\r\nwas discharged from the Navy. What significance do you\r\nattach to that fact?\r\n   \u201cA. Well. . . [p]rior to his entry into the military Mr.\r\nThompson is described almost uniformly . . . as passive, as\r\ncompliant, as eager to please, as gentle, as timid, as eager\r\nto run from attacks.\r\n   \u201cAt some point . . . he began to notice that people were\r\ntrying to hurt him all the time, that officers and other\r\npeople of his rank and slightly above his rank attempted\r\nto provoke him, that they sometimes physically assaulted\r\nhim, that he thought he was being followed a lot, and that\r\nhe sometimes struck out in what he thought was defense\r\nand then later found out from other people who he knew\r\nand trusted that there wasn\u2019t anything to defend against\r\nor that there might not have been anything to defend\r\nagainst.\r\n   \u201cQ. This is what he related to you during your interview\r\n30                  BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n               Appendix to opinion of BREYER, J.\r\n\r\nlast August?\r\n  \u201cA. Right. The people who saw him after the military\r\neach were struck by how very different he seemed. That\r\nwas the word that kept being used, \u2018different.\u2019 Sometimes\r\nthe people I was speaking to were not able to describe\r\nwhat different meant, but, for example, the grandmother\r\nsaid that he was different as in not right, that he wasn\u2019t\r\nhimself. Ms. Wharton tells me that the grandmother was\r\nvery well aware that he was in deep psychological distress,\r\nand, in fact, the grandmother suggested that he be taken\r\nto the psychiatric unit at Grady Hospital in Atlanta, I\r\nbelieve, for treatment. The grandmother observed him\r\nstaring off into space for long periods of time. She ob-\r\nserved him mumbling to himself. When she asked him\r\nwhat he was doing, he told her he had no idea what she\r\nwas talking about. She said that was very different from\r\nthe boy who left her to go into service.\r\n  \u201cThe sister has even a better glimpse of him than that,\r\nbecause he actually went to live with her for a while, and\r\nshe said he was bizarre. She described him as paranoid.\r\nShe said that he would explode for no reason at all, that\r\nshe was afraid of him for the very first time in her life,\r\nthat they had always been terribly close, the sort of close\r\nwhere if there was only one piece of bread to eat they\r\nwould share it, that they always looked out for one an-\r\nother, and that suddenly he was behaving in ways that\r\nshe simply could not identify. She described three very\r\nserious episodes of aggression and emotional upset that\r\nshe said are what led her to approach her grandmother\r\nabout what to do for treatment for him.\r\n    .            .            .          .            .\r\n  \u201cQ. You state that the schizoaffective disorder, bipolar\r\ntype, would substantially impair Mr. Thompson\u2019s ability to\r\nconform his conduct to the requirements of the law. How\r\nso?\r\n  \u201cA. There are points in time when Mr. Thompson is out\r\n                  Cite as: 545 U. S. ____ (2005)           31\r\n\r\n                Appendix to opinion of BREYER, J.\r\n\r\nof contact with reality. He is responding to situations that\r\nsimply don\u2019t exist or that he perceives in extremely exag-\r\ngerated or different form. A person is not able to conform\r\none\u2019s conduct to the law if you are frankly delusional or\r\nhallucinating in some way. Mr. Thompson over the years\r\nhas had both of those symptoms.\r\n   \u201cQ. So it\u2019s this delusional aspect of this disorder that is\r\nthe main factor that would keep him from having the\r\nability to conform his conduct to the requirements of law,\r\nif I understand you correctly?\r\n   \u201cA. Is it the main factor? Let me say that I think it\u2019s at\r\nleast as potent a factor if not more as the other aspect of\r\nhis mental illness, which is that he has emotional disregu-\r\nlation.\r\n   \u201cQ. Meaning?\r\n   \u201cA. Meaning Mr. Thompson often is not in control of his\r\nemotions. He has episodes of rage, of aggression, that he\r\ndoesn\u2019t understand or relate to very well. He\u2019s told about\r\nthem later. Sometimes he remembers them, sometimes he\r\ndoesn\u2019t. He is often embarrassed about his behavior af-\r\nterwards, but there are points at which I believe he\u2019s not\r\nin control of what he\u2019s doing.\r\n   \u201cQ. When you say \u2018he\u2019s not in control of what he\u2019s do-\r\ning,\u2019 are you saying that it\u2019s impulsive behavior?\r\n   \u201cA. If I am emotionally disregulated, if I\u2019m over-aroused\r\nand overreactive and I operate out of a faulty belief sys-\r\ntem, so that not only do I have the impulse to do things\r\nthat I ordinarily wouldn\u2019t, but I also think things are\r\ngoing on that aren\u2019t, I have a combination in which yes, I\r\nsuppose you could call it impulse, but you also have to\r\ntake the notion into account that it might be an impulse to\r\ndo something that doesn\u2019t make any sense.\r\n   \u201cQ. Does this disorder prevent Mr. Thompson from\r\nplanning his activities?\r\n   \u201cA. Sometimes, yes, it does.\r\n   \u201cQ. And so the inability to plan, would that be a factor\r\n32                  BELL v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n               Appendix to opinion of BREYER, J.\r\n\r\nthat would prevent him from conforming his conduct to\r\nthe requirements of the law?\r\n  \u201cA. If that were in operation at some time. In the his-\r\ntory of the Department of Corrections\u2019 mental health\r\nrecords, when he\u2019s properly medicated I don\u2019t think that\u2019s\r\ntrue about him.\r\n  \u201cQ. Is it your professional opinion, then, that when he is\r\nmedicated he has the ability to plan, but when he is not\r\nmedicated he does not always have the ability to plan?\r\n  \u201cA. Those two things are true. It\u2019s also true that if he\u2019s\r\ninadequately medicated or improperly medicated he\r\ndoesn\u2019t have the ability to plan anything. I don\u2019t know\r\nwhether he has impulses. I think he\u2019s all impulse, so to\r\nhave impulses implies that there\u2019s a part of you that\u2019s not\r\nimpulsive. For example, when Mr. Chavis and I saw him\r\nduring my second interview with him, he could not have\r\nplanned anything at all, not beyond the nanosecond in\r\nwhich he was experiencing the world. But he was receiv-\r\ning psychotropic medications at the time, so that\u2019s why I\r\nhave to put that qualifier in there.\u201d\r\n",

We hold that, even assuming a court may withhold its man- date after the denial of certiorari in some cases, the Court of Appeals' decision to do so here was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In 1985, Gregory Thompson and Joanna McNamara abducted Brenda Blanton Lane from a store parking lot in Shelbyville, Tennessee. After forcing Lane to drive them to a remote location, Thompson stabbed her to death. Thompson offered no evidence during the guilt phase of trial and was convicted by a jury of first-degree murder.</p>\n<p>Thompson's defense attorneys concentrated their efforts on persuading the sentencing jury that Thompson's posi- tive qualities and capacity to adjust to prison life provided good reasons for not imposing the death penalty. Before trial, Thompson's counsel had explored the issue of his mental condition. The trial judge referred Thompson to a state-run mental health facility for a 30-day evaluation. The resulting report indicated that Thompson was compe- tent at the time of the offense and at the time of the ex- amination. The defense team retained their own expert, Dr. George Copple, a clinical psychologist. At sentencing Copple testified that Thompson was remorseful and still had the ability to work and contribute while in prison. Thompson presented the character testimony of a number of witnesses, including former high school teachers, his grandparents, and two siblings. Arlene Cajulao, Thomp- son's girlfriend while he was stationed with the Navy in Hawaii, also testified on his behalf. She claimed that Thompson's behavior became erratic after he suffered head injuries during an attack by three of his fellow ser- vicemen. In rebuttal the State called Dr. Glenn Watson, a clinical psychologist who led the pretrial evaluation of Thompson's competence. Watson testified that his exami- nation of Thompson revealed no significant mental illness.</p>\n<p>The jury sentenced Thompson to death. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct review. <i>State</i> v. <i>Thompson</i>, 768 S. W. 2d 239 (Tenn. 1989), cert. denied, 497 U. S. 1031 (1990).</p>\n<p>In his state postconviction petition, Thompson claimed his trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to conduct an adequate investigation into his mental health. Thomp- son argued that his earlier head injuries had diminished his mental capacity and that evidence of his condition should have been presented as mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of trial. Under Tennessee law, mental illness that impairs a defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law is a mitigating factor in capital sentencing. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a739-2-203(j)(8) (1982) (re- pealed); \u00a7XX-XX-XXX(j)(8) (Lexis 2003). The postconviction court denied relief following an evidentiary hearing, and the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. <i>Thompson</i> v. <i>State</i>, 958 S. W. 2d 156 (1997). The Tennes- see Supreme Court denied discretionary review.</p>\n<p>Thompson renewed his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim on federal habeas. Thompson's attorneys retained a psychologist, Dr. Faye Sultan, to assist with the proceed- ings. At this point, 13 years had passed since Thompson's conviction. Sultan examined and interviewed Thompson three times, questioned his family members, and conducted an extensive review of his legal, military, medical, and prison records, App. 12, before diagnosing him as suffering from schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, <i>id.,</i> at 20. She contended that Thompson's symptoms indicated he was \"suffering serious mental illness at the time of the 1985 offense for which he has been convicted and sentenced. This mental illness would have substantially impaired Mr. Thompson's ability to conform his conduct to the require- ments of the law.\" <i>Ibid</i>. Sultan prepared an expert report on Thompson's behalf and was also deposed by the State.</p>\n<p>In February 2000, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee granted the State's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the habeas petition. The court held that Thompson failed to show that the state court's resolution of his claim rested on an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent or on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in state court. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d). The District Court also stated that Thompson had not presented \"any significant probative evidence that [he] was suffering from a significant mental disease that should have been presented to the jury during the pun- ishment phase as mitigation.\" No. 4:98\u0097CV006 (ED Tenn., Feb. 17, 2000), App. to Pet. for Cert. 270. Sultan's deposi- tion and report, however, had apparently not been in- cluded in the District Court record.</p>\n<p>While Thompson's appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit was pending, he filed a motion in the District Court under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) request- ing that the court supplement the record with Sultan's expert report and deposition. Thompson's habeas counsel at the time explained that the failure to include the Sultan evidence in the summary judgment record was an over- sight. Thompson also asked the Court of Appeals to hold his case in abeyance pending a ruling from the District Court and attached the Sultan evidence in support of his motion.</p>\n<p>The District Court denied the Rule 60(b) motion as untimely, and the Court of Appeals denied Thompson's motion to hold his appeal in abeyance. On January 9, 2003, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's denial of habeas relief. 315 F. 3d 566. The lead opinion, authored by Judge Suhrheinrich, rea- soned that there was no ineffective assistance of counsel because Thompson's attorneys were aware of his head injuries and made appropriate inquiries into his mental fitness. <i>Id.,</i> at 589-592. In particular, Thompson's attor- neys had requested that the trial court order a competency evaluation. A team of experts at the Middle Tennessee Mental Health Institute, a state-run facility, found \"no mental illness, mental defect, or insanity.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 589. Dr. George Copple, the clinical psychologist retained by Thompson's attorneys, also \"found no evidence of mental illness.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Judge Suhrheinrich emphasized that none of the experts retained by Thompson since trial had of- fered an opinion on his mental condition at the time of the crime. <i>Id.,</i> at 589-592. The lead opinion contained a passing reference to Thompson's unsuccessful Rule 60(b) motion, but did not discuss the Sultan deposition or expert report in any detail. <i>Id.,</i> at 583, n. 13. Judge Moore con- curred in the result based on Thompson's failure to pre- sent \"evidence that his counsel knew or should have known either that Thompson was mentally ill or that his mental condition was deteriorating at the time of his trial or at the time of his crime.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 595.</p>\n<p>Thompson filed a petition for rehearing. The petition placed substantial emphasis on the Sultan evidence, quot- ing from both her deposition and expert report. The Court of Appeals denied the petition for rehearing and stayed the issuance of its mandate pending the disposition of Thompson's petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p>This Court denied certiorari on December 1, 2003. 540 U. S. 1051. The following day, Thompson filed a motion in the Court of Appeals seeking to extend the stay of man- date pending disposition of his petition for rehearing in this Court. The Court of Appeals granted the motion and \"ordered that the mandate be stayed to allow appellant time to file a petition for rehearing from the denial of the writ of certiorari, and thereafter until the Supreme Court disposes of the case.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 348. On Janu- ary 20, 2004, this Court denied Thompson's petition for rehearing. 540 U. S. 1158. A copy of the order was filed with the Court of Appeals on January 23, 2004. The Court of Appeals, however, did not issue its mandate.</p>\n<p>The State, under the apparent assumption that the federal habeas corpus proceedings had terminated, filed a motion before the Tennessee Supreme Court requesting that an execution date be set. The court scheduled Thompson's execution for August 19, 2004.</p>\n<p>From February to June 2004, there were proceedings in both state and federal courts related to Thompson's pre- sent competency to be executed under <i>Ford</i> v. <i>Wainwright</i>, 477 U. S. 399 (1986). The state courts, after considering Sultan's testimony (which was based in part on followup observations after her initial 1998 examination) as well as that of other experts, found Thompson competent to be executed. <i>Thompson</i> v. <i>State</i>, 134 S. W. 3d 168 (Tenn. 2004). Thompson's <i>Ford</i> claim was still pending before the Federal District Court when on June 23, 2004, some seven months after this Court denied certiorari, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an amended opinion in Thompson's initial federal habeas case. 373 F. 3d 688. The new decision vacated the District Court's judgment denying habeas relief and remanded the case for an evi- dentiary hearing on Thompson's ineffective-assistance-of- counsel claim. <i>Id.,</i> at 691-692. The Court of Appeals relied on its equitable powers to supplement the record on appeal with Dr. Sultan's 1999 deposition after finding that it was \"apparently negligently omitted\" and \"probative of Thompson's mental state at the time of the crime.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 691. The court also explained its authority to issue an amended opinion five months after this Court denied a petition for rehearing: \"[W]e rely on our inherent power to reconsider our opinion prior to the issuance of the man- date, which has not yet issued in this case.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 691- 692. Judge Suhrheinrich authored a lengthy separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, which explained that his chambers initiated the <i>sua sponte</i> reconsideration of the case. He agreed with the majority about the probative value of the Sultan deposition, refer- ring to the evidence as \"critical.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 733. Unlike the majority, however, Judge Suhrheinrich would have relied upon fraud on the court to justify the decision to expand the record and issue an amended opinion. <i>Id.,</i> at 725-726, 729-742. He found \"implausible\" the explanation offered by Thompson's habeas counsel for his failure to include the Sultan deposition in the District Court record, <i>id.,</i> at 742, and speculated that counsel \"planned to unveil Dr. Sultan's opinion on the eve of Thompson's execution,\" <i>id</i>., at 738, n. 21.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari. 543 U. S. ___ (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>At issue in this case is the scope of the Court of Appeals' authority to withhold the mandate pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41. As relevant, the Rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(b) When Issued. The court's mandate must issue</blockquote>\n<blockquote>7 calendar days after the time to file a petition for re- hearing expires, or 7 calendar days after entry of an order denying a timely petition for panel rehearing, petition for rehearing en banc, or motion for stay of mandate, whichever is later. The court may shorten or extend the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(c) Effective Date. The mandate is effective when issued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(d) Staying the Mandate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) On Petition for Rehearing or Motion. The timely filing of a petition for panel rehearing, petition for rehearing en banc, or motion for stay of mandate, stays the mandate until disposition of the petition or motion, unless the court orders otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) Pending Petition for Certiorari.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(A) A party may move to stay the mandate pending the filing of a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court. The motion must be served on all parties and must show that the certiorari petition would present a substantial question and that there is good cause for a stay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) The stay must not exceed 90 days, unless the period is extended for good cause or unless the party who obtained the stay files a petition for the writ and so notifies the circuit clerk in writing within the pe- riod of the stay. In that case, the stay continues until the Supreme Court's final disposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(D) The court of appeals must issue the mandate immediately when a copy of a Supreme Court order denying the petition for writ of certiorari is filed.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Tennessee argues that the Court of Appeals was re- quired to issue the mandate following this Court's denial of Thompson's petition for certiorari. The State's position rests on Rule 41(d)(2)(D), which states that \"[t]he court of appeals must issue the mandate immediately when a copy of a Supreme Court order denying the petition for writ of certiorari is filed.\" This provision, the State points out, admits of no exceptions, so the mandate should have issued on the date that a copy of this Court's order deny- ing certiorari was filed with the Court of Appeals, <i>i.e.,</i> December 8, 2003.</p>\n<p>The State further contends that because the mandate should have issued in December 2003, the Court of Ap- peals' amended opinion was in essence a recall of the mandate. If this view is correct, the Court of Appeals' decision to revisit its earlier opinion must satisfy the standard established by <i>Calderon</i> v. <i>Thompson,</i> 523 U. S. 538 (1998). <i>Calderon</i> held that \"where a federal court of appeals <i>sua sponte</i> recalls its mandate to revisit the merits of an earlier decision denying habeas corpus relief to a state prisoner, the court abuses its discretion unless it acts to avoid a miscarriage of justice as defined by our habeas corpus jurisprudence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 558. See also <i>Schlup</i> v. <i>Delo,</i> 513 U. S. 298 (1995); <i>Sawyer</i> v. <i>Whitley,</i> 505 U. S. 333 (1992).</p>\n<p>Thompson counters by arguing that Rule 41(d)(2)(D) is determinative only when the court of appeals enters a stay of the mandate to allow the Supreme Court to dispose of a petition for certiorari. The provision, Thompson says, does not affect the court of appeals' broad discretion to enter a stay for other reasons. He relies on Rule 41(b), which provides the court of appeals may \"shorten or extend the time\" in which to issue the mandate. Because the author- ity vested by Rule 41(b) is not limited to the period before a petition for certiorari is denied, he argues that the Court of Appeals had the authority to stay its mandate following this Court's denial of certiorari and rehearing. Although the Court of Appeals failed to issue an order staying the mandate after we denied rehearing, Thompson asserts that the court exercised its Rule 41(b) powers by simply failing to issue it.</p>\n<p>To resolve this case, we need not adopt either party's interpretation of Rule 41. Instead, we hold that\u0097 assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> both that the Rule authorizes a stay of the mandate following the denial of certiorari and also that a court may stay the mandate without entering an order\u0097here the Court of Appeals abused its discretion in doing so.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>We find an abuse of discretion for the following reasons.</p>\n<p>Prominent among our concerns is the length of time between this Court's denial of certiorari and the Court of Appeals' issuance of its amended opinion. We denied Thompson's petition for certiorari in December 2003 and his petition for rehearing one month later. From this last denial, however, the Court of Appeals delayed issuing its mandate for over five months, releasing its amended opinion in June.</p>\n<p>The consequence of delay for the State's criminal justice system was compounded by the Court of Appeals' failure to issue an order or otherwise give notice to the parties that the court was reconsidering its earlier opinion. The Court of Appeals had issued two earlier orders staying its mandate. The first order stayed the mandate pending disposition of Thompson's petition for certiorari. The second order extended the stay to allow Thompson time to file a petition for rehearing with this Court and \"thereaf- ter until the Supreme Court disposes of the case.\" So by the express terms of the second order the mandate was not to be stayed after this Court acted; and when we denied rehearing on January 20, 2004, the Court of Appeals' second stay dissolved by operation of law. Tennessee, acting in reliance on the Court of Appeals' earlier orders and our denial of certiorari and rehearing, could assume that the mandate would\u0097indeed must\u0097issue. While it might have been prudent for the State to verify that the mandate had issued, it is understandable that it pro- ceeded to schedule an execution date. Thompson, after all, had not sought an additional stay of the mandate, and the Court of Appeals had given no indication that it might be revisiting its earlier decision.</p>\n<p>This latter point is important. It is an open question whether a court may exercise its Rule 41(b) authority to extend the time for the mandate to issue through mere inaction. Even assuming, however, that a court could effect a stay for a short period of time by withholding the mandate, a delay of five months is different in kind. \"Basic to the operation of the judicial system is the princi- ple that a court speaks through its judgments and orders.\" <i>Murdaugh Volkswagen, Inc.</i> v. <i>First National Bank of</i> <i>South Carolina</i>, 741 F. 2d 41, 44 (CA4 1984). Without a formal docket entry neither the parties nor this Court had, or have, any way to know whether the court had stayed the mandate or simply made a clerical mistake. Cf. <i>Bal-</i> <i>lard</i> v. <i>Commissioner</i>, 544 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 17). The dissent claims \"the failure to notify the parties was likely due to a simple clerical error\" on the part of the Clerk's office. <i>Post,</i> at 12-13 (opinion of BREYER, J.). The record lends no support to this speculation. The dissent also fails to explain why it is willing to apply a \"presump- tion of regularity\" to the panel's actions but not to the Clerk's. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals could have spared the parties and the state judicial system considerable time and resources if it had notified them that it was reviewing its original panel decision. After we denied Thompson's petition for rehearing, Tennessee scheduled his execution date. This, in turn, led to various proceedings in state and federal court to determine Thompson's present competency to be executed. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Thompson</i> v. <i>State</i>, 134 S. W. 3d 168 (Tenn. 2004). All of these steps were taken in reliance on the mistaken impression that Thompson's first federal habeas case was final. The State had begun to \"invok[e] its entire legal and moral authority in support of executing its judgment.\" <i>Calderon</i> v. <i>Thompson,</i> 523 U. S., at 556- 557.</p>\n<p>The parties' assumption that Thompson's habeas pro- ceedings were complete was all the more reasonable be- cause the Court of Appeals' delay in issuing its mandate took place after we had denied certiorari. As a practical matter, a decision by this Court denying discretionary review usually signals the end of litigation. While Rule 41(b) may authorize a court to stay the mandate after certiorari is denied, the circumstances where such a stay would be warranted are rare. See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>First Gibraltar</i> <i>Bank, FSB</i> v. <i>Morales</i>, 42 F. 3d 895 (CA5 1995); <i>Alphin</i> v. <i>Henson</i>, 552 F. 2d 1033 (CA4 1977). In the typical case, where the stay of mandate is entered solely to allow this Court time to consider a petition for certiorari, Rule 41(d)(2)(D) provides the default: \"The court of appeals must issue the mandate immediately when a copy of a Supreme Court order denying the petition for writ of certiorari is filed.\"</p>\n<p>By providing a mechanism for correcting errors in the courts of appeals before Supreme Court review is re- quested, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure ensure that litigation following the denial of certiorari will be infrequent. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 40(a) (\"Unless the time is shortened or extended by order or local rule, a petition for panel rehearing may be filed within 14 days after entry of judgment\"). See also Fed. Rules App. Proc. 35 (rehearing en banc), 40 (panel rehearing).</p>\n<p>Indeed, in this case Thompson's petition for rehearing and suggestion for rehearing en banc pressed the same arguments that eventually were adopted by the Court of Appeals in its amended opinion. The Sultan evidence, first presented to the Court of Appeals as an attachment to Thompson's motion to hold his appeal in abeyance, was quoted extensively in the petition for rehearing to the Court of Appeals. Pet. for Rehearing and Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc in No. 2:00-5516 (CA6), pp. 12-20, 28-31. After the request for rehearing was denied, the State could have assumed with good reason that the Court of Appeals was not impressed by Thompson's arguments based on the Sultan evidence. The court's opportunity to consider these arguments at the rehearing stage is yet another factor supporting our determination that the decision to withhold the mandate was in error. Cf. <i>Calderon</i> v. <i>Thompson, supra,</i> at 551-553 (questioning whether a \"mishandled law clerk transition\" and the \"failure of another judge to notice the action proposed by the original panel\" would justify recalling the mandate in a nonhabeas case).</p>\n<p>The dissent's explanation of how the Sultan evidence was overlooked is inaccurate in several respects. For example, the statements that the \"Sultan documents were not in the initial record on appeal,\" <i>post,</i> at 9, and that \"the panel previously had not seen these documents\" before the rehearing stage, <i>id.,</i> at 9, convey the wrong impression. Although the Sultan evidence was not part of the District Court's summary judgment record, the docu- ments were included in the certified record on appeal as attachments to Thompson's Rule 60(b) motion. Record 133; Docket Entry 4/5/02 in No. 98\u0097CV\u00976 (ED Tenn.); Docket Entry 4/10/02 in No. 00-5516 (CA6). The dissent also argues the petition for rehearing did not adequately bring the Sultan evidence to the attention of the Court of Appeals. <i>Post,</i> at 9-10, 13-14. This is simply untrue. The original panel opinion, which did not discuss the Sultan evidence in any detail, emphasized that Thompson had failed to produce any evidence that he was mentally ill at the time of his offense. 315 F. 3d, at 590; <i>id.,</i> at 595-596 (Moore, J., concurring). The petition for rehearing attacked this conclusion in no uncertain terms and placed the Sultan evidence front and center. Here, for example, is an excerpt from the petition's table of contents:</p>\n<blockquote>\"II. THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN THE RECORD OF THOMPSON'S MENTAL ILLESS AT THE TIME OF THE CRIME IS WRONG</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"A. Thompson Has Set Forth Above The Record Facts Demonstrating His Mental Illness At The Time of The Crime</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"B. The Majority Overlooks The Facts And Expert Opinion Set Forth In Dr. Sultan's Report and Deposi- tion.\" Pet. for Rehearing and Suggestion for Rehear- ing En Banc in No. 2:00-5516 (CA6), p. ii.</blockquote>\n<p>See also <i>id.,</i> at 1 (mentioning the Sultan evidence in thesecond paragraph of the statement in support of panel rehearing). The rehearing petition did not explain why Sultan's deposition and expert report had been omitted from the summary judgment record but that is beside the point. The petition acknowledged that the Sultan evi- dence was first presented to the District Court as an at- tachment to the Rule 60(b) motion, <i>id.,</i> at 29, and gave the Sultan evidence a prominent and explicit mention in the table of contents. It is difficult to see how Thompson's counsel could have been clearer in telling the Court of Appeals that it was wrong. The dissent's treatment of this issue assumes that judges forget even the basic details of a capital case only one month after issuing a 38-page opin- ion and that judges cannot be relied upon to read past the first page of a petition for rehearing. The problem is that the dissent cannot have it both ways: If the Sultan evi- dence is as crucial as the dissent claims, it would not easily have been overlooked by the Court of Appeals at the rehearing stage.</p>\n<p>Our review of the Sultan deposition reinforces our con- clusion that the Court of Appeals abused its discretion by withholding the mandate. Had the Sultan deposition and report been fully considered in the federal habeas proceed- ings, it no doubt would have been relevant to the District Court's analysis. Based on the Sultan deposition Thomp- son could have argued he suffered from mental illness at the time of his crime that would have been a mitigating factor under Tennessee law and that his trial attorneys were constitutionally ineffective for failing to conduct an adequate investigation into his mental health.</p>\n<p>Relevant though the Sultan evidence may be, however, it is not of such a character as to warrant the Court of Appeals' extraordinary departure from standard appellate procedures. There are ample grounds to conclude the evidence was unlikely to have altered the District Court's resolution of Thompson's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. Sultan examined Thompson for the first time on August 20, 1998, App. 37, some 13 years after Thompson's crime and conviction. She relied on the deterioration in Thompson's present mental health\u0097something that obvi- ously was not observable at the time of trial\u0097as evidence of his condition in 1985. (Indeed, there was a marked decline in his condition during the 6-month period be- tween Sultan's first two visits. <i>Id.,</i> at 51-58.) Sultan's findings regarding Thompson's condition in 1985 are contradicted by the testimony of two experts who exam- ined him at the time of trial, Dr. Watson and Dr. Copple. Watson performed a battery of tests at the Middle Tennes- see Mental Health Institute, where Thompson was re- ferred by the trial court for an examination, and concluded that Thompson \" '[did] not appear to be suffering from any complicated mental disorder which would impair his capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of the alleged offenses, or which would impair his capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.'\" 19 Tr. 164. Indeed, Watson presented substantial evidence supporting his conclusion that Thompson was malingering for mental illness. <i>Id.,</i> at 151-152; 20 <i>id.,</i> at 153-160. For example, Thompson claimed he could not read despite a B average in high school and one year's college credit. 19 <i>id.,</i> at 137; 20 <i>id.,</i> at 151. Thompson's test scores also indicated that he was attempting to fake schizophrenia. 20 <i>id.,</i> at 153- 154. Copple, the psychologist retained by Thompson's defense team, agreed with Watson that Thompson was not suffering from mental illness. 19 <i>id.,</i> at 58. Had the Sultan deposition been included in the District Court record, Thompson still would have faced an uphill battle to obtaining federal habeas relief. He would have had to argue that his trial attorneys should have continued to investigate his mental health even after both Watson and Copple had opined that there was nothing to uncover.</p>\n<p>Sultan's testimony does not negate Thompson's respon- sibility for committing the underlying offense, but it does bear upon an argument that Thompson's attorneys could have presented at sentencing. Sultan's ultimate conclu- sion\u0097that Thompson's mental illness substantially im- paired his ability to conform his conduct to the require- ments of the law\u0097is couched in the language of a mitigating factor under Tennessee law. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a739-2-203(j)(8) (1982). See also \u00a7XX-XX-XXX(j)(8) (Lexis 2003). Thompson's trial attorneys, however, chose not to pursue a mitigation strategy based on mental illness, stressing instead character evidence from family and friends and expert testimony that he had the capacity to adjust to prison. <i>Thompson</i> v. <i>State</i>, 958 S. W. 2d, at 164- 165. This strategic calculation, while ultimately unsuc- cessful, was based on a reasonable investigation into Thompson's background. Sultan relied on three witnesses in preparing her report: Thompson's grandmother, sister, and ex-girlfriend. These witnesses not only were inter- viewed by the defense attorneys; they testified at sentenc- ing. Consultation with these witnesses, when combined with the opinions of Watson and Copple, provided an adequate basis for Thompson's attorneys to conclude that focusing on Thompson's mental health was not the best strategy. As the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals noted, \"Because two experts did not detect brain damage, counsel cannot be faulted for discarding a strategy that could not be supported by a medical opinion.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 165.</p>\n<p>Without a single citation to the record, the dissent sug- gests that Thompson's attorneys failed to conduct ade- quate interviews of the defense witnesses on whom Sultan relied in her report. <i>Post,</i> at 14-15. Most of the informa- tion on Thompson's childhood was provided to Sultan by Nora Jean Wharton, Thompson's older sister. App. 16-18. Setting aside the fact that Thompson did not argue in state court that his counsel's interview of Wharton was inadequate, <i>Thompson</i> v. <i>State</i>, 958 S. W. 2d, at 160-169, Thompson's attorneys cannot be faulted for failing to elicit from her any details on Thompson's difficult home life. After all, Wharton testified at trial that Thompson's child- hood was \"poor,\" but \"very happy.\" 18 Tr. 3. The dissent also implies that the experts who examined Thompson lacked information necessary to reach an accurate as- sessment. The record refutes this assertion. In conduct- ing his examination, Watson had access to Thompson's social history and military records. 19 <i>id.,</i> at 149; 20 <i>id.,</i> at 186 (Exh. 102, pp. 11, 27-28). Watson was also aware of the prior head injuries as well as Thompson's claim that he heard voices. 19 <i>id.,</i> at 152; 20 <i>id.,</i> at 154-155. Never- theless, Watson, whose evaluation was contemporaneous with the trial, found no evidence that Thompson was mentally ill at the time of the crime. Watson's report was unequivocal on this point:</p>\n<blockquote>\" 'Mr. Thompson's speech and communication were coherent, rational, organized, relevant, and devoid of circumstantiality, tangentiality, looseness of associa- tions, paranoid ideation, ideas of reference, delusions, and other indicators of a thought disorder. His affect was appropriate to his thought content, and he exhib- ited no flight of ideas, manic, depressed, or bizarre behaviors, and his speech was not pressured nor rapid. He exhibited none of the signs of an affective illness. His judgment and insight are rather poor. Psychological testing revealed him to be functioning in the average range intellectually, to exhibit no signs of organicity or brain damage on the Bender-Gestalt Test and the Bender Interference Procedure. Person- ality profiles revealed no evidence of a psychosis, but indicated malingering in the mental illness direction. (For example, the schizophrenic score was at T 120, while clinical observations revealed no evidence of a thought disorder.) Mr. Thompson's memory for recent and remote events appeared unimpaired.'\" 20 <i>id.,</i> at 159-160.</blockquote>\n<p>Sultan's testimony provides some support for the argu- ment that the strategy of emphasizing Thompson's posi- tive attributes was a mistake in light of Thompson's dete- riorated condition 13 years after the trial. This evidence, however, would not come close to satisfying the miscar- riage of justice standard under <i>Calderon</i> had the Court of Appeals recalled the mandate. Neither, in our view, did this evidence justify the Court of Appeals' decision to withhold the mandate without notice to the parties, which in turn led the State to proceed for five months on the mistaken assumption that the federal habeas proceedings had terminated. The dissent suggests that failing to take account of the Sultan evidence would result in a \"miscar- riage of justice,\" <i>post,</i> at 1-2, 16, but the dissent uses that phrase in a way that is inconsistent with our precedents. In <i>Sawyer</i> v. <i>Whitley,</i> 505 U. S., at 545-547, this Court held that additional mitigating evidence could not meet the miscarriage of justice standard. Only evidence that affects a defendant's eligibility for the death penalty\u0097which the Sultan evidence is not\u0097can support a miscarriage of justice claim in the capital sentencing context. <i>Id.,</i> at 547; <i>Calderon,</i> 523 U. S., at 559-560.</p>\n<p>One last consideration informs our review of the Court of Appeals' actions. In <i>Calderon</i>, we held that federalism concerns, arising from the unique character of federal habeas review of state-court judgments, and the policies embodied in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Pen- alty Act of 1996 required an additional presumption against recalling the mandate. This case also arises from federal habeas corpus review of a state conviction. While the State's reliance interest is not as strong in a case where, unlike <i>Calderon</i>, the mandate has not issued, the finality and comity concerns that animated <i>Calderon</i> are implicated here. Here a dedicated judge discovered what he believed to have been an error, and we are respectful of the Court of Appeals' willingness to correct a decision that it perceived to have been mistaken. A court's discretion under Rule 41 must be exercised, however, in a way that is consistent with the \" 'State's interest in the finality of convictions that have survived direct review within the state court system.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 555 (quoting <i>Brecht</i> v. <i>Abra-</i> <i>hamson,</i> 507 U. S. 619, 635 (1993)). Tennessee expended considerable time and resources in seeking to enforce a capital sentence rendered 20 years ago, a sentence that reflects the judgment of the citizens of Tennessee that Thompson's crimes merit the ultimate punishment. By withholding the mandate for months\u0097based on evidence that supports only an arguable constitutional claim\u0097while the State prepared to carry out Thompson's sentence, the Court of Appeals did not accord the appropriate level of respect to that judgment. See <i>Calderon</i> v. <i>Thompson, su-</i> <i>pra,</i> at 554-557.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals may have been influenced by Sultan's unsettling account of Thompson's condition dur- ing one of her visits. She described Thompson as being in \"terrible psychological condition,\" \"physically filthy,\" and \"highly agitated.\" App. 51. This testimony raised ques- tions about Thompson's deteriorating mental health and perhaps his competence to be executed, but these concerns were properly addressed in separate proceedings. Based on the most recent state-court decision, which rejected the argument that Thompson is not competent to be executed, it appears that his condition has improved. <i>Thompson</i> v. <i>State</i>, 134 S. W. 3d, at 184-185. Proceedings on this issue were underway in the District Court when the Court of Appeals issued its second opinion. If those proceedings resume, the District Court will have an opportunity to address these matters again and in light of the current evidence.</p>\n<p>Taken together these considerations convince us that the Court of Appeals abused any discretion Rule 41 ar- guably granted it to stay its mandate, without entering a formal order, after this Court had denied certiorari. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for Sixth Circuit is re- versed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE SOUTER, and JUSTICE GINSBURG join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>This capital case arises out of unusual circumstances\u0097 circumstances of a kind that I have not previously experi- enced in the 25 years I have served on the federal bench. After an appellate court writes and releases an opinion, but before it issues its mandate, the writing judge, through happenstance, comes across a document that (he reasonably believes) shows not only that the court's initial decision is wrong but that the decision will lead to a seri- ous miscarriage of justice. What is the judge to do?</p>\n<p>What the judge did here was to spend time\u0097hundreds of hours (while a petition for certiorari was pending before this Court and during the five months following our denial of the petition for rehearing)\u0097reviewing the contents of the vast record with its many affidavits, reports, tran- scripts, and other documents accumulated in the course of numerous state and federal proceedings during the pre- ceding 20 years. The judge ultimately concluded that his initial instinct about the document was correct. The document was critically important. It could affect the outcome of what is, and has always been, the major issue in the case. To consider the case without reference to it could mean a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p>The judge consequently wrote a lengthy opinion (almost 30,000 words) explaining what had happened. The other members of the panel did not agree with everything in that opinion, but they did agree that their initial decision must be vacated.</p>\n<p>The Court commendably describes what occurred as follows: A \"dedicated judge discovered what he believed to have been an error, and we are respectful of the Court of Appeals' willingness to correct a decision that it perceived to have been mistaken.\" <i>Ante</i>, at 18. The Court, however, does not decide this case in a manner consistent with that observation. A somewhat more comprehensive account of the nature of the \"error\"\u0097of the matter at stake, of the importance of the document, of the mystery of its late appearance, of the potential for a miscarriage of justice\u0097 should help make apparent the difficult circumstance the panel believed it faced. It will also explain why there was no \"abuse\" of discretion in the panel's effort to \"correct a decision that it perceived to have been mistaken.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Judge Suhrheinrich, the panel member who investi- gated the record, is an experienced federal judge, serving since 1984 as a federal trial court judge and since 1990 as a federal appellate judge. He wrote a lengthy account of the circumstances present here. To understand this case, one must read that full account and then compare it with the Court's truncated version. I provide a rough summary of the matter based upon my own reading of his opinion. 373 F. 3d 688, 692-742 (CA6 2004).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The panel's initial decision, issued on January 9, 2003, focused upon an issue often raised when federal habeas courts review state proceedings in a capital case, namely, the effectiveness of counsel at the original trial. 315 F. 3d 566, 587-594 (CA6 2003). See <i>Strickland</i> v. <i>Washington</i>, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). In this instance, the federal ineffec- tive-assistance claim was that state trial counsel had not sufficiently investigated the background of the defendant, Gregory Thompson. Thompson claimed that an adequate investigation would have shown, to the satisfaction of testifying experts, that he suffered from episodes of schizophrenia at the time of the crime. The schizophre- nia\u0097though episodic\u0097would have proved a mitigating circumstance at the penalty phase. 373 F. 3d, at 697-698, and n. 4.</p>\n<p>Thompson's trial took place in a Tennessee state court, where he was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. His state-appointed counsel put on no defense at trial. At sentencing, however, counsel sought to show that Thompson was schizophrenic. State forensic psychologists examined Thompson and concluded that Thompson, probably \"malingering,\" did not show genuine and signifi- cant symptoms of schizophrenia at that time and was not mentally ill. A clinical psychologist hired by Thompson's counsel examined Thompson for eight hours and reached approximately the same conclusion: he said that Thomp- son was not <i>then</i> mentally ill. <i>Id</i>., at 692, 694-695.</p>\n<p>Thompson raised the issue of his mental condition in state postconviction proceedings, which he initiated in 1990. His expert witness, Dr. Gillian Blair, testified (with much supportive material) that Thompson was by that time clearly displaying serious schizophrenic symptoms\u0097 voice illusions, attempts at physical self-mutilation, and the like. Indeed, the State conceded that he was under a regime of major antipsychotic medication. But Dr. Blair said that she could not determine whether Thompson had been similarly afflicted (<i>i.e.</i>, suffering from episodes of schizophrenia) at the time of the crime without a thorough background investigation\u0097funds for which the state court declined to make available. The state court then ruled in the State's favor. <i>Id</i>., at 694-695.</p>\n<p>Thompson filed a habeas petition in Federal District Court about eight months after the state court's denial of postconviction relief became final. As I said above, see <i>supra</i>, at 3, he claimed ineffective assistance of counsel. The Federal District Court appointed counsel, an assistant federal public defender. Counsel then obtained the ser- vices of two experts, Dr. Barry Crown and Dr. Faye Sul- tan. Both examined Thompson, and the latter, Dr. Sultan, conducted the more thorough background investigation that Dr. Blair had earlier sought. The State, after depos- ing Dr. Sultan, moved for summary judgment. 373 F. 3d, at 696, 700-704, 711.</p>\n<p>The District Court granted that motion on the ground that \"Thompson has not provided this Court with anything other than factually unsupported allegations that he was incompetent at the time he committed the crime,\" nor \"has Thompson provided this Court with any significant proba- tive evidence that [he] was suffering from a significant mental disease that should have been presented to the jury during the punishment phase as mitigation evidence.\" <i>Id</i>., at 712-713 (quoting District Court's memorandum opinion (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>Thompson (now with a new public defender as counsel) appealed the District Court's grant of summary judgment in the State's favor. (A little over a year later, while the appeal was still pending, Thompson's new counsel, appar- ently having discovered that Dr. Sultan's deposition and report had not been included in the record before the District Court, filed a motion in that court for relief from judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), seeking to supplement the record with those documents. Counsel also filed a motion in the appellate court, with the Sultan deposition attached, requesting that the appeal be held in abeyance while the District Court considered the Rule 60(b) motion. Both motions were denied, and Thompson's counsel did not take an appeal from the Dis- trict Court's denial of the Rule 60(b) motion.) 373 F. 3d, at 714-715, and n. 10, 724-725.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals reviewed the District Court's grant of summary judgment. In doing so, the appellate panel examined the record before that court. It noted that Thompson's federal habeas counsel had hired two experts (Crown and Sultan), and had told the court (in an offer of proof) that they would provide evidence that Thompson suffered from mental illness <i>at the time of the crime</i>. But the appellate panel found that neither expert had done so. Indeed, said the panel, Thompson had \"never submitted to any court <i>any</i> proof that he suffered from severe mental illness at the time of the crime.\" 315 F. 3d, at 590 (em- phasis altered). Though Thompson's several attorneys had made the same allegation for many years in several different courts (said the panel), \"at each opportunity, counsel fail[ed] to secure an answer to the critical issue of whether Thompson was mentally ill at the time of the crime.\" <i>Ibid</i>. That fact, concluded the panel (over a dis- sent), was fatal to Thompson's basic ineffective-assistance- of-counsel claim. Obviously \"trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to discover something that does not appear to exist.\" <i>Ibid.;</i> see also <i>id</i>., at 595 (Moore, J., concurring in result) (\"Thompson has presented no evidence that his [trial] counsel knew or should have known either that Thompson was mentally ill or that his mental condition was deteriorating at the time of his trial or at the time of his crime\"). The dissenting judge thought Thompson had made out an ineffective-assistance claim by showing that his trial counsel had relied on an inadequate expert, that is, an expert without the necessary qualifica- tions to counter the State's experts' conclusions. <i>Id</i>., at 599-605 (opinion of Clay, J.).</p>\n<p>The appeals court issued its opinion on January 9, 2003. Thompson's appointed federal appeals counsel filed a rehearing petition, which the court denied on March 10, 2003. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 346 (Order in No. 00-5516 (CA6)). Thompson's counsel then sought Supreme Court review. This Court denied review (and rehearing) about one year later. 540 U. S. 1051 (2003) (denying certiorari); 540 U. S. 1158 (2004) (denying rehearing).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals, following ordinary appellate-court practice, withheld issuance of its mandate while the case was under review here, namely during calendar year 2003. During that time and in the months that followed, some- thing unusual happened. Judge Suhrheinrich realized that the panel, in reaching its decision, seemed to have overlooked documents provided by Dr. Sultan that likely were relevant. In September 2003, the appellate court called for the entire certified record. Upon reviewing that record, Judge Suhrheinrich found Dr. Sultan's deposition and accompanying report. 373 F. 3d, at 692-693; App. to Pet. for Cert. 347-348; see also Appendix, <i>infra</i>.</p>\n<p>The Sultan documents filled the evidentiary gap that underlay the District Court's and the appellate panel's determinations. These documents made clear that Dr. Sultan had investigated Thompson's background in depth and that in her (well-supported) opinion, Thompson <i>had</i> suffered from serious episodic bouts of schizophrenia <i>at</i> <i>the time the crime was committed</i>. Clearly the documents contained evidence supporting Thompson's claim regard- ing his mental state at the time of the offense. Why had the District Court denied the existence of <i>any</i> such evi- dence? Why had Judge Suhrheinrich, and the other mem- bers of the panel (and the State, which took Dr. Sultan's deposition) done the same?</p>\n<p>Judge Suhrheinrich then drafted an opinion that sought to answer three questions:</p>\n<p>Question One: Do these documents actually provide strong evidence that Thompson was schizophrenic (and seriously so) at the time of the crime?</p>\n<p>Question Two: If so, given the many previous opportuni- ties that Thompson has had to raise the issue of his men- tal health, to what extent would these documents be likely to matter in respect to the legal question raised in Thomp- son's federal proceedings, <i>i.e.</i>, would they likely lead a federal habeas court to hold that Thompson's trial counsel was ineffective for failing to undertake a background investigation akin to that performed by Dr. Sultan?</p>\n<p>Question Three: How did these documents previously escape our attention? 1</p>\n<p>The panel answered the first question\u0097regarding the importance of the documents\u0097unanimously. Sultan's report and deposition were critically important. As Judge Suhrheinrich's opinion explains, these documents detail Thompson's horrendous childhood, his family history of mental illness, his self-destructive schizophrenic behavior (including auditory hallucinations) as a child, his mood swings and bizarre behavior as a young adult, and a wors- ening of that behavior after a serious beating to his head that he suffered while in the Navy. For example, Dr. Sultan's examination of Thompson and her interviews with Thompson's family members and others revealed that as a child Thompson would repeatedly bang his head against the wall to \"knock the Devil out\" after his grand- mother yelled at him, \"You have the Devil in you.\" 373 F. 3d, at 716 (internal quotation marks omitted). These documents explain how Thompson, as a young adult, would talk to himself and scream and cry for no apparent reason. They suggest that he had bouts of paranoia.</p>\n<p>The documents provide strong support for the conclu- sion that Thompson suffered from episodes of schizophre- nia at the time of the offense. And they thereby offer significant support for the conclusion that, had earlier testifying experts had this information, they could have countered the State's experts' conclusion that Thompson was malingering at the time of trial. Thus, the Sultan materials seriously undermined the foundation of the State's position in respect to Thompson's mental condition.</p>\n<p>The Sultan materials also revealed that trial counsel failed to discover other mitigating evidence of importance. Interviews with family members revealed repeated inci- dents of violence in the family, including an episode in which, as a young boy, Thompson witnessed his father brutally beat and rape his mother. His grandmother, with whom Thompson and his siblings lived after their mother died, subjected them to abuse and neglect. She would forget to feed the children, leaving them to steal money from under her bed to buy food. These and other circum- stances are detailed in sections of the Sultan report and deposition reproduced in the Appendix, <i>infra</i>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>The panel also responded unanimously and affirma- tively to the second question: Would federal-court access to the Sultan documents likely have made a significant difference in respect to the federal legal question at issue in Thompson's habeas petition, namely, the failure of Thompson's trial counsel to investigate his background? Trial counsel had had important indications that some- thing was wrong. Indeed, counsel himself had sought an evaluation of Thompson's mental condition. He also was aware of Thompson's violent behavior in the military, and knew that Thompson had said he had had auditory hallu- cinations all his life. He was aware, too, of the changes in Thompson's behavior. Should counsel not then have investigated further?</p>\n<p>The Sultan documents make clear that, had he done so, he would have had a strong answer to the State's experts. Thus the documents were relevant to the outcome of the federal habeas proceedings. The Federal District Court based its grant of summary judgment on the premise that there was <i>no</i> evidence supporting Thompson's claim. The documents showed that precisely such evidence was then available.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3</h2>\n<p>The panel (while disagreeing about how to allocate blame) agreed in part about the answer to the third ques- tion: how these documents previously had escaped the panel's attention. The judges agreed that the Sultan documents were not in the initial record on appeal. The panel's original opinion, while mentioning both Dr. Sultan and Dr. Crown, assumed that neither expert had ad- dressed Thompson's mental condition at the time of the crime. 315 F. 3d, at 583, n. 13 (\"Sultan's affidavit does not discuss Thompson's mental state <i>at the time of the offense</i>\" (emphasis added)); <i>ibid</i>. (explaining that Thompson filed a Rule 60(b) motion to supplement the record with Dr. Sultan's report, but not mentioning that the report ad- dressed Thompson's mental condition at the time of the offense); see also <i>supra,</i> at 5.</p>\n<p>How had the panel overlooked the copies of the Sultan deposition attached to (1) the rehearing petition and (2) the (Rule 60(b)-related) motion to hold the appeal in abey- ance? As for the rehearing petition, the reason could well lie in the petition's (incorrect) suggestion that the panel had already considered the appended document as part of the original record. See Pet. for Rehearing and Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc in No. 2:00-5516 (CA6), p. 1 (\"A majority of this panel overlooked other proof in the record, including but not limited to, the expert opinion of Dr. Faye E. Sultan\"); see also <i>id</i>., at 28-32. While the petition explains the importance of the documents, it does not explain the circumstances, namely, that the panel previ- ously had not seen these documents. Instead, it gives the impression that counsel was simply reemphasizing a matter the panel had already considered. To that extent, the petition reduced the likelihood that the panel would make the connection it later made and fatally weakened its argument for <i>re-</i>hearing.</p>\n<p>As for the motion to hold the appeal in abeyance, the panel's failure to recognize the significance of the ap- pended Sultan materials is also understandable. The motion gives the impression that the appellate court would have been able to handle any problem arising from the exclusion of these materials in an appeal taken from the District Court's Rule 60(b) decision. The appellate court, however, never had any such opportunity because counsel did not appeal the District Court's denial of the Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Once the panel understood the significance of the Sultan report, it had to decide what to do. An appellate court exists to correct legal errors made in the trial court. What legal error had the District Court committed? The appeal concerned its grant of summary judgment in the State's favor. The District Court made that decision on the basis of the record before it, and that record apparently lacked the relevant documents. How then could an appeals court say that the District Court was wrong to grant the sum- mary judgment motion?</p>\n<p>The panel answered this question by <i>not</i> holding that the District Court had erred. Finding that the Sultan documents had been \"apparently negligently omitted\" from the record, it exercised its equitable powers to sup- plement the record with the deposition. 373 F. 3d, at 691. It also found that, since the State itself had helped to create that document (because the State had taken Sul- tan's deposition), the District Court's reconsideration of the matter would not unfairly prejudice the State. And it noted that this case is a death case. Then, relying on its \"inherent power to reconsider\" an opinion \"prior to the issuance of the mandate,\" the court issued a new opinion, vacating the District Court's grant of summary judgment to the State and remanding the case to the District Court for further proceedings on the matter. <i>Ibid</i>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The question before us is not whether we, as judges, would have come to the same conclusions as did the panel of the Court of Appeals. It is whether the three members of the appellate panel abused their discretion in reconsid- ering the matter and, after agreeing unanimously that they would have reached a different result had they con- sidered the overlooked evidence, vacating the District Court's judgment and remanding the case.</p>\n<p>The Court concludes that the panel's reconsideration of the matter and decision to vacate the District Court's judgment amounted to an \"abuse of discretion.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1. It therefore reverses the panel's unanimous interlocutory judgment remanding a capital case to the District Court for an evidentiary hearing. The Court lists five reasons why the Court of Appeals \"abused its discretion.\" None of these reasons, whether taken separately or considered together, stands up to examination.</p>\n<p><i>Reason One. During the 5-month period after this Court denied rehearing of Thompson's certiorari petition, during which time the Court of Appeals was reconsidering the matter, it gave \"no indication that it might be revisiting its earlier decision.\" Had it \"notified\" the parties, the court \"could have spared the parties and the state judicial system considerable time and resources.\" Ante</i>, at 10.</p>\n<p>If this consideration favors the Court's conclusion, it does so to a very modest degree. For one thing, the Fed- eral Rules themselves neither set an unchangeable dead- line for issuance of a mandate nor require notice when the court enlarges the time for issuance. Compare Fed. Rule App. Proc. 41(b) (2005) (\"The court may shorten or extend the time\"), with Rule 41(b) (1968) (mandate \"shall\" issue \"unless the time is shortened or extended <i>by order</i>\" (em- phasis added)). The Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 41 expressly contemplate that the parties will themselves check the docket to determine whether the mandate has issued. See Advisory Committee's 1998 Note on subd. (c) of Rule 41 (\"[T]he parties can easily calculate the antici- pated date of issuance and verify issuance of the man- date[;] the entry of the order on the docket alerts the parties to that fact\"). And Sixth Circuit Rules require the Circuit Clerk to provide all parties with copies of the mandate. See Internal Operating Procedure 41(a) (CA6 2005) (\"Copies of the mandate are distributed to all parties and the district court clerk's office\"). Thus, the State's attorneys knew, or certainly should have known, that the mandate had not issued, and, as experienced practitioners, they also knew, or certainly should have known, that a proceeding is not technically over until the court has issued its mandate. And if concerned by the delay (and some delay in such matters is not uncommon), they could have asked the Circuit Clerk why the mandate had not issued. If necessary, they could have filed a motion seek- ing that information or seeking the mandate's immediate issuance.</p>\n<p>For another thing, since notification is a clerical duty, the panel may have thought the parties <i>had</i> been notified. One of the judges on the panel could well have instructed the Circuit Clerk not to issue the mandate, and then simply have assumed that the Clerk would notify the parties of that fact (though the Clerk, perhaps inadver- tently, did not do so). Why would the court want to hide what it was doing from the parties? Once we apply a presumption of regularity to the panel's actions, we must assume that the failure to notify the parties was likely due to a simple clerical error.</p>\n<p>Further, the prejudice to the State that troubles the Court was likely small or nonexistent. The need to reset an execution date is not uncommon, and the state court's execution order explicitly foresaw that possibility. See 373 F. 3d, at 692 (Tennessee Supreme Court order set Thomp- son's execution date for August 19, 2004, \"unless other- wise ordered by this Court or other appropriate authority\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Moreover, the State has not even argued\u0097despite ample opportunity to do so\u0097that the further proceedings ordered by the panel would actually have required it to set a new date.</p>\n<p>Finally, the State did not, by way of a petition for re- hearing, make any of its \"failure to notify\" arguments to the Court of Appeals. Although the law does not require the State to seek rehearing, such a petition would have permitted the panel to explain why the State was not notified and possibly to explore the matter of prejudice. There is no reason to reward the State for not filing a petition by assuming prejudice where none appears to exist.</p>\n<p>Given the State's likely knowledge that the mandate had not issued, the existence of avenues for resolving any uncertainty, and the small likelihood of prejudice, the lack of notice does not significantly advance the Court's \"abuse of discretion\" finding. Indeed, if the Court believes that the Court of Appeals could have issued a revised opinion correcting its earlier judgment <i>if only it had given notice to</i> <i>the parties,</i> the sanction it now imposes\u0097outright rever- sal\u0097is far out of proportion to the crime.</p>\n<p><i>Reason Two. The court's \"opportunity to consider\" the</i> <i>Sultan evidence \"at the rehearing stage is yet another</i> <i>factor supporting\" the abuse-of-discretion \"determination.\"</i> <i>Ante</i>, at 12. I agree that it is unfortunate that, upon review of the rehearing petition, the panel failed to make the connection that would have allowed it, at that time, to reach the same conclusion it reached later. Still, the petition wrongly implied that the Sultan documents were part of the original appeal. Because it did not request rehearing on the ground that the documents were <i>not</i> in the record, it did not offer a genuine \"opportunity to con- sider\" the Sultan evidence.</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, I cannot agree that the court's opportunity to consider these documents at the rehearing stage should militate in favor of finding an abuse of discretion. To the contrary, I believe we should encourage, rather than discourage, an appellate panel, when it learns that it has made a serious mistake, to take advantage of an opportunity to correct it, rather than to ignore the problem.</p>\n<p><i>Reason Three. The \"Sultan evidence . . . is not of such a</i> <i>character as to warrant [a] . . . departure from standard</i> <i>appellate procedures\" because \"the evidence was unlikely to</i> <i>have altered the District Court's resolution of Thompson's</i> <i>ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.\" Ante,</i> at 14. <i>That</i> <i>is to say, given the expert testimony in the trial court, the</i> <i>Sultan evidence is unlikely meaningfully to have strength-</i> <i>ened Thompson's claim before the Federal District Court.</i> <i>Ante</i>, at 14-15.</p>\n<p>This conclusion is wrong. The Court argues the follow- ing: (1) Dr. Sultan's conclusion rests in significant part upon interviews with three witnesses, Thompson's grand- mother and sister (with whom Dr. Sultan spoke directly) and his girlfriend (whose interview with a defense investi- gator Dr. Sultan reviewed); (2) since all three of these witnesses testified at sentencing, Thompson's counsel must have consulted them at the time; and (3) \"[c]onsultation with these witnesses, when combined with the opinions of [the State's expert] and [Thompson's ex- pert], provided an adequate basis for Thompson's attor- neys to conclude that focusing on Thompson's mental health was not the best strategy.\" <i>Ante</i>, at 16. The Court then says that trial counsel's \"strategy\" may have been \"a mistake,\" <i>ante</i>, at 17, but apparently not enough of a mistake to amount to inadequate assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p>But how do the Court's conclusions follow from the premises? Dr. Sultan's interview of the three witnesses apparently turned up new information, indeed, crucial information. Why does that fact not tend show that trial counsel's own \"consultation\" with those witnesses was inadequate? Or, if trial counsel was aware of the informa- tion, why does that not tend to show that trial counsel hired an expert who was not qualified to assess Thomp- son's mental condition, or that counsel failed adequately to convey the critical information to that expert? This Court in <i>Wiggins</i> v. <i>Smith</i>, 539 U. S. 510, 523-525 (2003), found trial counsel inadequate for failing to conduct a reasonable investigation, given notice that such an investigation would likely turn up important mitigating evidence. See also <i>Rompilla</i> v. <i>Beard</i>, <i>ante</i>, p. ___. Why is the same not true here, where Thompson's trial counsel was fully aware of the need for a background investigation, and then either did not ask the right questions, or did not hire the right expert, or did not convey the right information to that expert? At the least, is there not a good argument to this effect\u0097an argument that the Sultan documents signifi- cantly strengthened? All three judges on the panel thought so: They concluded that they would have reached a different result on Thompson's ineffective-assistance-of- counsel claim had they been aware of the Sultan docu- ments. The Court does not satisfactorily explain its basis for second-guessing the panel on this point.</p>\n<p><i>Reason Four. The Sultan evidence does \"not come close</i> <i>to satisfying the miscarriage of justice standard under</i> <i>Calderon.\" Ante,</i> at 17 (referring to <i>Calderon</i> v. <i>Thomp-</i> <i>son</i>, 523 U. S. 538 (1998)). As the Court apparently agrees, see <i>ante</i>, at 8-9, <i>Calderon</i> does not apply here. And the panel's basic conclusion\u0097that consideration of Thompson's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim with- out the benefit of the Sultan evidence would constitute a grave miscarriage of justice\u0097survives <i>any</i> plausible stan- dard of review. I can find nothing in the Court's opinion that explains why the panel's conclusion is wrong.</p>\n<p><i>Reason Five. The Court of Appeals \"did not accord the</i> <i>appropriate level of respect\" to the State's \"judgment.\"</i> <i>Ante,</i> at 19. If by \"judgment\" the Court means to refer to the state court's original judgment of conviction, this reason simply repeats Reason Four. The panel carefully examined the entire record and determined that there is a significant likelihood the Sultan evidence would demon- strate a violation of the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p>If the Court means to refer to the state court's judgment not to set aside the conviction in state postconviction proceedings, the Court is clearly wrong. The state court on collateral review refused to authorize funds for a back- ground investigation, one for which Thompson's expert then showed a strong need, and which Thompson's expert now shows could well have demonstrated a significantly mitigating mental condition. How is it disrespectful of the State for a federal habeas court to identify a constitutional error that occurred in state-court proceedings in a capital case, by taking account of a key piece of evidence, mistak- enly omitted from the record?</p>\n<p>If the Court means to refer to the State's decision to proceed with the execution, I cannot possibly agree. The Court could not mean that <i>any</i> exercise by a federal court to correct an inadvertent, and important, evidentiary error is \"disrespectful\" of a State's effort to proceed to execution. But if it does not mean \"any\" exercise at all, then how can it say the present exercise is disrespectful? The present exercise embodies as thorough an examination of the record and as significant a piece of evidence as one is likely to find. The process\u0097the detail and care with which the Court of Appeals combed the record\u0097does not show \"disrespect.\" It shows the contrary.</p>\n<p>The upshot is that the Court's five reasons are uncon- vincing. The Court simply states those reasons as conclu- sions. It fails to show how, or why, the unanimous panel erred in reaching diametrically opposite conclusions, all supported with detailed evidence set forth in Judge Suhr- heinrich's opinion. It does not satisfactorily explain the evidentiary basis for its own conclusions. And, in the process, it loses sight of the question before us: again, <i>not</i> whether we, as judges, would have reached the same conclusion that the three judges on the panel reached, but rather whether they, having unanimously agreed that their earlier decision was wrong, abused their discretion in setting it right.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Ultimately this case presents three kinds of question. The first is a narrow legal question. Has the Court of Appeals abused its discretion? For the reasons I have set forth, the answer to that question, legally speaking, must be \"no.\"</p>\n<p>The second is an epistemological question. How, in respect to matters involving the legal impact of the Sultan report and deposition, can the Court replace the panel's judgment with its own? Judge Suhrheinrich's opinion demonstrates why any assessment of that legal impact must grow out of thorough knowledge of the record. He spent hundreds of hours with its numerous documents in order to make that assessment. Those of his conclusions that were shared by the other members of the panel are logical, rest upon record-based facts, and are nowhere refuted (in respect to those facts) by anything before us or by anything in the Court's opinion. How can the Court know that the panel is wrong?</p>\n<p>The third question is about basic jurisprudence. A legal system is based on rules; it also seeks justice in the indi- vidual case. Sometimes these ends conflict. To take ac- count of such conflict, the system often grants judges a degree of discretion, thereby providing oil for the rule- based gears. When we tell the Court of Appeals that it cannot exercise its discretion to correct the serious error it discovered here, we tell courts they are not to act to cure serious injustice in similar cases. The consequence is to divorce the rule-based result from the just result. The American judicial system has long sought to avoid that divorce. Today's decision takes an unfortunate step in the wrong direction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>APPENDIX TO OPINION OF BREYER, J.</h2>\n<p>Excerpts from the Gregory Thompson Psychological Report prepared by Dr. Faye E. Sultan at the River- bend Maximum Security Institution (RMSI) (July 22, 1999), App. 11-20.</p>\n<p>\"REFERRAL QUESTIONS:\"Mr. Gregory Thompson was referred for psychological evaluation in July, 1998 by attorney Mr. Stephen M. Kissinger of the Federal Defender Services of Eastern Tennessee Incorporated. Mr. Thompson was convicted of murder in 1985. This evaluation was requested to address the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote>\"1. Mr. Thompson's current psychological status[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"2. Mr. Thompson's likely psychological status and mental state before and surrounding the time of the 1985 offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"3. Social, environmental, psychological, and economic factors in the life of Mr. Thompson which might have be[en] considered to be mitigating in nature at the time of his trial.</blockquote>\n<p>\"PROCEDURE:\"Psychological evaluation of Mr. Thompson was initiated on August 20, 1998. This first evaluation session extended over a period of approximately four hours and consisted of clinical interview and the administration of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory\u00972 (MMPI\u00972). Some review of prior psychological evaluation records was con- ducted to establish what formal psychological and neuro- psychological testing had been administered to Mr. Thompson. Levels of current intellectual and neuropsy- chological functioning had been recently assessed by neu- ropsychologist, Barry Crown, Ph.D., so no attempt was made to replicate this type of assessment. \"Following the 8-20-98 initial evaluation session, a very extensive review of legal, military, medical, prison and psychiatric/psychological records was initiated. A list of the documents examined is attached to this report.</p>\n<p>. . . . .</p>\n<p>\". . . Two further interviews were conducted with Mr. Thompson for [the] limited purpose [of determining Thompson's competence to participate in habeas proceed- ings], on 2-2-99 and 4-7-99, totaling approximately six hours of additional observation. Voluminous Tennessee Department of Corrections mental health, medical, and administrative records were reviewed at this time as well.</p>\n<p>. . . . .</p>\n<p>\"[T]he extensive record review conducted, the ten hours of clinical observations made of Mr. Thompson during the preceding eleven months, the interviews conducted with collateral informants, and the recent and past psychologi- cal testing which had been administered provide enough data to make it possible to render professional opinions about Mr. Thompson's mental state at and around the time of the 1985 offense.</p>\n<p>\"CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS:</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Gregory Thompson was cooperative with the assess- ment procedure. He answered all questions posed to him and appeared to be alert, watchful and interested in the interview process. His speech was sometimes tangential and rambling. Although motor behavior appeared con- trolled there was a manic quality to his verbalizations. Mr. Thompson was oriented as to person, place and time, but he repeatedly expressed his firm belief that he had written each and every song which played on the radio. \"Mr. Thompson displayed symptoms of psychosis during the two subsequent meetings. The details of these ses- sions will not be reviewed here.</p>\n<p>\"FORMAL PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING:</p>\n<p>\"The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality lnventory\u00972 (MMPI\u00972) was administered to Mr. Thompson on 8-20- 98. It had been determined in other examination settings that Mr. Thompson's level of reading competence exceeded the necessary level of 8th grade ability required for proper administration of this test.</p>\n<p>\"The MMPI\u00972 profile produced by Mr. Thompson is con- sidered valid and appropriate for interpretation. Indi- viduals producing similar profiles are described as experi- encing significant psychological difficulties and chronic psychological maladjustment. Such individuals are con- sidered to be highly suspicious of others, often displaying paranoid features. There is indication in this profile of the presence of a thought disorder and the inability to manage emotions. The world is perceived as a threatening and dangerous place and fears are viewed as externally gener- ated and reality-based rather than as a product of an internally generated state. The behavior of such individu- als is often described as hostile, aggressive, and rebellious against authority. Poor impulse control, lack of trust in others, and low frustration tolerance may result in such individuals displaying rage in interpersonal relationships. \"Individuals producing this testing profile are also de- scribed as experiencing depressed mood. There is the strong possibility that such individuals have contemplated suicide and report preoccupation with feeling guilty and unworthy. Testing items were endorsed which suggest memory and concentration problems, and an inability to make decisions.</p>\n<p>\"RELEVANT PSYCHOLOGICAL/PSYCHIATRIC DATA CONTAINED IN RECORDS:</p>\n<p>\"The[re] is substantial documentation throughout the Tennessee Department of Corrections records that Mr. Greg Thompson has suffered from significant mental illness since at least the time of . . . his incarceration in 1985<i>.</i> He has been treated almost continuously with some combination of major tranquilizer and/or anti-depressant and/or anti-anxiety medications. He has received a vari- ety of diagnostic labels including Psychosis, Psychosis Not Otherwise Specified, Paranoid Schizophrenia, Mania, Mixed Substance Abuse, Schizophrenia, BiPolar Affective Disorder, Schizoaffective Disorder, Malingering, and Adult Antisocial Behavior. This is clearly indicative of the Ten- nessee DOC mental health staff's view that Mr. Thompson has experienced major mental illness throughout at least most of his period of incarceration. Further, there is extensive documentation contained in these records of many episodes of bizarre aggressive and/or self-destructive behavior.</p>\n<p>\"INTERVIEWS WITH COLLATERAL WITNESSES:</p>\n<p>\"Five individuals were interviewed (either by telephone or face-to-face) who provided significant supplemental infor- mation about the life circumstances and past/present psychological functioning of Mr. Gregory Thompson.</p>\n<p>\"Ms. Maybelle Lamar</p>\n<p>\"Ms. Lamar is Mr. Thompson's maternal grandmother. She was interviewed by telephone on July 21, 1999. Ms. Lamar assumed total responsibility for the care and rear- ing of Mr. Thompson and his two older siblings after his mother was killed when Mr. Thompson was approximately five years old. Mr. Thompson remained in her home until he entered the military as a young adult.</p>\n<p>\"Ms. Lamar recalls the period following her daughter's fatal automobile accident as one of tremendous strain and disruption for her. She was unable to describe the reac- tion of the three young children to their mother's death because she 'took to my bed' for approximately five or six weeks following the accident. Ms. Lamar was unable to attend to these children in any way at that time. She did not recall how they obtained food or clothing, or whether they were in any distress. Ms. Lamar reported that she was drinking alcohol quite heavily during this period and that she left her bed to resume household activities only because the children contracted a serious medical illness. \"Ms. Lamar described Mr. Thompson as displaying signifi- cantly 'different' behavior when he returned to visit her following his discharge from the U. S. Navy. 'Greg didn't act the same'. Unlike the 'eager to please', passive, some- times funny, gentle boy who she had reared, Mr. Thomp- son was 'angry', 'sometimes sad'. 'I don't think he wanted me to know what was going on with him. He mostly just stayed away from me.' Ms. Lamar reported that she no- ticed Mr. Thompson sometimes 'staring off into space' or 'talking to himself '. She would ask him about these be- haviors. 'He'd deny it. He acted like he didn't know what I was talking about.' Ms. Lamar recalls being quite con- cerned about her grandson's mental state during this time. She did not recall ever being asked these questions at any time before or during Mr. Thompson's trial.</p>\n<p>\"Ms. Nora Jean Hall Wharton</p>\n<p>\"Nora Jean Wharton is Mr. Thompson's older sister. A lengthy telephone interview was conducted with her on July 21, 1999. She grew up in the same home as Mr. Thompson and had continuous contact with him through- out his childhood. Mr. Thompson lived briefly in the home of his sister following his discharge from the military.</p>\n<p>\"Ms. Wharton described Mr. Greg Thompson as a highly sensitive, passive, timid, emotionally vulnerable child. She described a childhood of great hardship. According to her report, their grandmother, Ms. Maybelle Lamar[,] was verbally abusive, neglectful of the children's basic daily needs, highly critical, and unable to care properly for the children. Ms. Wharton described many instances of such abuse and neglect. She described the period following their mother's death as particularly chaotic and neglectful, recalling that often there was no food in the home and that the children would take money from under their grandmother's mattress to go and buy food. In the period following their mother's death, Ms. Wharton reported that her grandmother was continuously drunk and unable to care for her grandchildren. According to Ms. Wharton, Greg Thompson frequently witnessed his sister Nora being beaten by their grandmother.</p>\n<p>\"Ms. Wharton further recalled that she and her younger brother had witnessed the brutal beating and rape of their mother by their biological father. She recalls Greg stand- ing in the scene screaming and sobbing uncontrollably.</p>\n<p>\"Ms. Wharton reported that Greg would frequently cry at school during the early school years, and, as a result, was often the victim of intense mockery from his classmates. Because Ms. Wharton was in the same classroom as her brother she observed these behaviors and often intervened on her brother's behalf. She described Mr. Thompson's response to this abuse as quite passive.</p>\n<p>\"Of particular significance is Ms. Wharton's recollections about Mr. Thompson repeatedly banging his head against the wall of their home on many occasions during their early childhood. This behavior frequently followed their grandmother yelling at Greg 'You have the Devil in you.' Mr. Thompson would tell his sister that he was attempt- ing to 'knock the Devil out' of his head in this way. Ms. Wharton recalls believing that this behavior was quite odd.</p>\n<p>\"Following his discharge from military service, Ms. Whar- ton described Mr. Thompson's behavior as significantly different than his prior conduct and attitude. She re- ported several episodes of bizarre behavior which included a sudden intense emotional reaction without obvious external provocation. Mr. Thompson would become ex- tremely angry, would cry and scream for a len[g]thy period of time, would appear as if he might or actually become quite physically violent or aggressive, and then would suddenly retreat. Ms. Thompson reported this behavior and her concerns about it to her grandmother. Ms. Lamar suggested that Ms. Wharton take her brother to the psy- chiatric unit of the local hospital for treatment. Ms. Wharton did not attempt to get any treatment for Mr. Thompson and reports feeling quite guilty about this. \"Nora Jean Wharton described her own struggles with mental illness throughout the past fifteen years. She has received counseling to assist her in coping with the effects of her abusive childhood and she has been treated with a combination of a major tranquilizer (Stellazine) and anti- depressant medications. She reported that her younger half-sister Kim has also suffered from significant mental illness.</p>\n<p>\"CUSTODY OFFICERS AT RMSI</p>\n<p>\"Following the second interview conducted with Mr. Thompson on 2-2-99, I informally interviewed two cus- tody officers who escorted Mr. Thompson back to his cell. These officers have not as yet been identified by name. Both reported that they were aware that Mr. Thompson was quite mentally ill and that they were concerned about him. They further reported that they believed it would be in his best interest to be housed in a prison facility better equipped to deal with individuals experiencing severe mental illness.</p>\n<p>\"MICHAEL CHAVIS</p>\n<p>\"Federal Defender Services of Eastern Tennessee investi- gator, Mr. Michael Chavis, was interviewed about his July 29 through August 2, 1998 interview with Ms. Arlene Cajulao in Honolulu, Hawaii. Ms. Cajulao and Mr. Thompson had an intimate relationship and lived together for approximately four years, from 1980 to 1984.</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Chavis reported that Ms. Cajulao described Mr. Thompson as displaying increasingly bizarre behavior during the latter part of their relationship. Similar to descriptions proved by Ms. Nora Wharton, Ms. Cajulao reported several episodes of 'paranoid' and aggressive behavior which had no apparent external antecedent. She reported that Mr. Thompson sometimes thought that people were 'after' him. He would close all the curtains in the house because he did not want the person who was 'looking' for him to see him through the curtains. She remembers being quite concerned about Mr. Thompson's mental state.</p>\n<p>\"SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS:</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Gregory Thompson has experienced symptoms of major mental illness throughout his adult life. Indeed, there is information available which suggests that Mr. Thompson was displaying significant signs of mental illness from the time he was a small child. Self-injurious behavior is reported as early as six years old. There is extensive documentation contained within the records reviewed for this evaluation that Mr. Thompson has ex- perienced a thought disorder and/or an affective disorder of some type for many years.</p>\n<p>\"It is my opinion that Mr. Gregory Thompson is most appropriately diagnosed, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, as having Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type. As is typical of this illness, symptoms became apparent in early adulthood. Mr. Thompson was suffering serious mental illness at the time of the 1985 offense for which he has been convicted and sentenced. This mental illness would have substantially impaired Mr. Thompson's ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. \"Further, Mr. Thompson was the victim of severe child- hood emotional abuse and physical neglect. His family background is best described as highly neglectful and  economically deprived. Mr. Thompson repeatedly wit nessed episodes of violence during his childhood in which  one family member assaulted or brutalized another.  There are significant aspects of Mr. Thompson's social history that have been recognized as mitigating in other  capital cases </p>\n<p>\"It is important to note that all of the information related  to Mr. Thompson's early mental illness and social history  was available at the time of his 1985 trial. </p>\n<p>\"[signed]</p>\n<p>\"Faye E. Sultan, Ph.D.\" </p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Excerpts from the Deposition of Dr. Faye E. Sultan (July 22, 1999), <i>Id.,</i> at 71-73, 76-80.</p>\n<p>\"Q. What indicates to you or what indicia are there for you that suggest Mr. Thompson was displaying significant signs of mental illness from the time he was a small child? How do you arrive at that conclusion?</p>\n<p>\"A. .....</p>\n<p>\"By the time of the first grade, Mr. Thompson, when he was being yelled at by his grandmother, she was report- edly verbally abusive in the following fashion: She would yell at him you have the devil in you, boy. [His sister, Ms. Wharton] would then observe Mr. Thompson standing or sitting beside a wall repeatedly banging his head into the wall. She, in her role as protector of him, would ask him what was going on, and he would tell her he was trying to knock the devil out of his head. She recalls at the time, although she was quite young herself, being worried about his behavior and thinking of it as very odd.</p>\n<p>. . . . .</p>\n<p>\"Q. Sort of a self-punishment or a self-exorcism type thing?</p>\n<p>\"A. A self-injurious behavior is what we would call it I think. Mr. Thompson, when he was Greg, in the first and second and third grade had rather frequent hysterical crying episodes in classrooms that Ms. Wharton recalls also as very unusual in the context of his schoolroom situation. She describes him as being the subject of tor- ment on the part of the students because he behaved in an odd fashion. Sometimes he would simply begin to cry and wail and scream and apparently made a sound like a fire engine when he was sobbing and developed the nickname Fire Engine. That's reported in the trial transcript. She told me much more detail about actually the extent of those kind[s] of emotional outbursts.</p>\n<p>\"At home it was rather common for Mr. Thompson to begin to cry and scream during times when Ms. Wharton herself was being beaten by their grandmother. Ms. Wharton was the victim of physical abuse on the part of the grandmother. Mr. Thompson observed much of this since they were together virtually all of the time, and Nora Wharton was not really permitted much interaction out- side of their home.</p>\n<p>. . . . .</p>\n<p>\"Q. Your diagnosis for Mr. Thompson is schizoaffective disorder, comma, bipolar type. What leads you to that diagnosis from what you've reviewed and your testing results?</p>\n<p>\"A. What leads me to the diagnosis is that there is a long history, perhaps at this point almost a 20-year his- tory, of simultaneous thought disorder on the part of Mr. Thompson documented throughout all the records, and affective disorder, emotional disorder, being unable to regulate his emotions, sometimes falling into the pits of despair and becoming suicidal, sometimes becoming highly agitated and manic and having too much energy, too much exuberance, and grandiose thinking. The thought disorder is manifested in persecutory ideas, delu- sions of grandeur\u0097lots of different kinds of delusions actually\u0097auditory hallucinations that he sometimes admits to, sometimes suspected by the doctors who are doing the examination.</p>\n<p>\"The psychological testing early on in Mr. Thompson's incarceration confirm[s] the presence of a psychotic proc- ess. There was an MMPI administered to him by a prison psychologist in 1990 that is described as valid and indica- tive of psychotic process, and throughout the prison record he receives a variety of diagnoses that take into account both thought disorder and affective illness.</p>\n<p>\"The very best diagnosis to describe all of the complex of symptoms that I just talked to you about is schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type.</p>\n<p>\"Q. You note in your report Mr. Thompson was ob- served having a significant change in behavior after he was discharged from the Navy. What significance do you attach to that fact?</p>\n<p>\"A. Well. . . [p]rior to his entry into the military Mr. Thompson is described almost uniformly . . . as passive, as compliant, as eager to please, as gentle, as timid, as eager to run from attacks.</p>\n<p>\"At some point . . . he began to notice that people were trying to hurt him all the time, that officers and other people of his rank and slightly above his rank attempted to provoke him, that they sometimes physically assaulted him, that he thought he was being followed a lot, and that he sometimes struck out in what he thought was defense and then later found out from other people who he knew and trusted that there wasn't anything to defend against or that there might not have been anything to defend against.</p>\n<p>\"Q. This is what he related to you during your interview last August?</p>\n<p>\"A. Right. The people who saw him after the military each were struck by how very different he seemed. That was the word that kept being used, 'different.' Sometimes the people I was speaking to were not able to describe what different meant, but, for example, the grandmother said that he was different as in not right, that he wasn't himself. Ms. Wharton tells me that the grandmother was very well aware that he was in deep psychological distress, and, in fact, the grandmother suggested that he be taken to the psychiatric unit at Grady Hospital in Atlanta, I believe, for treatment. The grandmother observed him staring off into space for long periods of time. She ob- served him mumbling to himself. When she asked him what he was doing, he told her he had no idea what she was talking about. She said that was very different from the boy who left her to go into service.</p>\n<p>\"The sister has even a better glimpse of him than that, because he actually went to live with her for a while, and she said he was bizarre. She described him as paranoid. She said that he would explode for no reason at all, that she was afraid of him for the very first time in her life, that they had always been terribly close, the sort of close where if there was only one piece of bread to eat they would share it, that they always looked out for one an- other, and that suddenly he was behaving in ways that she simply could not identify. She described three very serious episodes of aggression and emotional upset that she said are what led her to approach her grandmother about what to do for treatment for him.</p>\n<p>. . . . .</p>\n<p>\"Q. You state that the schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, would substantially impair Mr. Thompson's ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. How so?</p>\n<p>\"A. There are points in time when Mr. Thompson is out of contact with reality. He is responding to situations that simply don't exist or that he perceives in extremely exag- gerated or different form. A person is not able to conform one's conduct to the law if you are frankly delusional or hallucinating in some way. Mr. Thompson over the years has had both of those symptoms.</p>\n<p>\"Q. So it's this delusional aspect of this disorder that is the main factor that would keep him from having the ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of law, if I understand you correctly?</p>\n<p>\"A. Is it the main factor? Let me say that I think it's at least as potent a factor if not more as the other aspect of his mental illness, which is that he has emotional disregu- lation.</p>\n<p>\"Q. Meaning?</p>\n<p>\"A. Meaning Mr. Thompson often is not in control of his emotions. He has episodes of rage, of aggression, that he doesn't understand or relate to very well. He's told about them later. Sometimes he remembers them, sometimes he doesn't. He is often embarrassed about his behavior af- terwards, but there are points at which I believe he's not in control of what he's doing.</p>\n<p>\"Q. When you say 'he's not in control of what he's do- ing,' are you saying that it's impulsive behavior?</p>\n<p>\"A. If I am emotionally disregulated, if I'm over-aroused and overreactive and I operate out of a faulty belief sys- tem, so that not only do I have the impulse to do things that I ordinarily wouldn't, but I also think things are going on that aren't, I have a combination in which yes, I suppose you could call it impulse, but you also have to take the notion into account that it might be an impulse to do something that doesn't make any sense.</p>\n<p>\"Q. Does this disorder prevent Mr. Thompson from planning his activities?</p>\n<p>\"A. Sometimes, yes, it does.</p>\n<p>\"Q. And so the inability to plan, would that be a factor that would prevent him from conforming his conduct to the requirements of the law?</p>\n<p>\"A. If that were in operation at some time. In the his- tory of the Department of Corrections' mental health records, when he's properly medicated I don't think that's true about him.</p>\n<p>\"Q. Is it your professional opinion, then, that when he is medicated he has the ability to plan, but when he is not medicated he does not always have the ability to plan?</p>\n<p>\"A. Those two things are true. It's also true that if he's inadequately medicated or improperly medicated he doesn't have the ability to plan anything. I don't know whether he has impulses. I think he's all impulse, so to have impulses implies that there's a part of you that's not impulsive. For example, when Mr. Chavis and I saw him during my second interview with him, he could not have planned anything at all, not beyond the nanosecond in which he was experiencing the world. But he was receiv- ing psychotropic medications at the time, so that's why I have to put that qualifier in there.\"</p>\n</div>",
