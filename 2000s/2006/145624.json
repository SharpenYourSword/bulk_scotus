ARIZONA\n\n      CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF ARIZONA\n\n      No. 05\u20135966. Argued April 19, 2006\u2014Decided June 29, 2006\nPetitioner Clark was charged with first-degree murder under an Ari\n  zona statute prohibiting \u201c[i]nten[tionally] or knowing[ly]\u201d killing a\n  police officer in the line of duty. At his bench trial, Clark did not con\n  test that he shot the officer or that the officer died, but relied on his\n  own undisputed paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the incident to\n  deny that he had the specific intent to shoot an officer or knowledge\n  that he was doing so. Accordingly, the prosecutor offered circumstan\n  tial evidence that Clark knew the victim was a police officer and tes\n  timony indicating that Clark had previously stated he wanted to\n  shoot police and had lured the victim to the scene to kill him. In pre\n  senting the defense case, Clark claimed mental illness, which he\n  sought to introduce for two purposes. First, he raised the affirmative\n  defense of insanity, putting the burden on himself to prove by clear\n  and convincing evidence that, in the words of another state statute,\n  \u201cat the time of the [crime, he] was afflicted with a mental disease or\n  defect of such severity that [he] did not know the criminal act was\n  wrong.\u201d Second, he aimed to rebut the prosecution\u2019s evidence of the\n  requisite mens rea, that he had acted intentionally or knowingly to\n  kill an officer.\n     Ruling that Clark could not rely on evidence bearing on insanity to\n  dispute the mens rea, the trial court cited the Arizona Supreme\n  Court\u2019s decision in State v. Mott, 187 Ariz. 536, 931 P. 2d 1046, which\n  refused to allow psychiatric testimony to negate specific intent and\n  held that Arizona does not allow evidence of a mental disorder short\n  of insanity to negate the mens rea element of a crime. As to his in\n  sanity, then, Clark presented lay testimony describing his increas\n  ingly bizarre behavior over the year before the shooting. Other lay\n  and expert testimony indicated, among other things, that Clark\n  thought that \u201caliens\u201d (some impersonating government agents) were\n2                           CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    trying to kill him and that bullets were the only way to stop them. A\n    psychiatrist testified that Clark was suffering from paranoid schizo\n    phrenia with delusions about \u201caliens\u201d when he killed the officer, and\n    concluded that Clark was incapable of luring the officer or under\n    standing right from wrong and was thus insane at the time of the\n    killing. In rebuttal, the State\u2019s psychiatrist gave his opinion that\n    Clark\u2019s paranoid schizophrenia did not keep him from appreciating\n    the wrongfulness of his conduct before and after the shooting. The\n    judge then issued a first-degree murder verdict, finding that in light\n    of that the facts of the crime, the expert evaluations, Clark\u2019s actions\n    and behavior both before and after the shooting, and the observations\n    of those who knew him, Clark had not established that his schizo\n    phrenia distorted his perception of reality so severely that he did not\n    know his actions were wrong.\n       Clark moved to vacate the judgment and life sentence, arguing,\n    among other things, that Arizona\u2019s insanity test and its Mott rule\n    each violate due process. He claimed that the Arizona Legislature\n    had impermissibly narrowed its insanity standard in 1993 when it\n    eliminated the first of the two parts of the traditional M\u2019Naghten in\n    sanity test. The trial court denied the motion. Affirming, the Ari\n    zona Court of Appeals held, among other things, that the State\u2019s in\n    sanity scheme was consistent with due process. The court read Mott\n    as barring the trial court\u2019s consideration of evidence of Clark\u2019s mental\n    illness and capacity directly on the element of mens rea.\nHeld:\n    1. Due process does not prohibit Arizona\u2019s use of an insanity test\n stated solely in terms of the capacity to tell whether an act charged\n as a crime was right or wrong. Pp. 6\u201315.\n       (a) The first part of the landmark English rule in M\u2019Naghten\u2019s\n Case asks about cognitive capacity: whether a mental defect leaves a\n defendant unable to understand what he was doing. The second part\n presents an ostensibly alternative basis for recognizing a defense of\n insanity understood as a lack of moral capacity: whether a mental\n disease or defect leaves a defendant unable to understand that his\n action was wrong. Although the Arizona Legislature at first adopted\n the full M\u2019Naghten statement, it later dropped the cognitive incapac\n ity part. Under current Arizona law, a defendant will not be ad\n judged insane unless he demonstrates that at the time of the crime,\n he was afflicted with a mental disease or defect of such severity that\n he did not know the criminal act was wrong. Pp. 6\u20137.\n       (b) Clark insists that the side-by-side M\u2019Naghten test represents\n the minimum that a government must provide, and he argues that\n eliminating the first part \u201c \u2018offends [a] principle of justice so rooted in\n the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as funda\n                   Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nmental,\u2019 \u201d Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 202. The claim entails\nno light burden, and Clark does not carry it. History shows no defer\nence to M\u2019Naghten that could elevate its formula to the level of fun\ndamental principle, so as to limit the traditional recognition of a\nState\u2019s capacity to define crimes and defenses. See, e.g., Patterson,\nsupra, at 210. Even a cursory examination of the traditional Anglo-\nAmerican approaches to insanity reveals significant differences a\nmong them, with four traditional strains variously combined to yield\na diversity of American standards. Although 17 States and the Fed\neral Government have adopted recognizable versions of the\nM\u2019Naghten test with both its components, other States have adopted\na variety of standards based on all or part of one or more of four vari\nants. The alternatives are multiplied further by variations in the\nprescribed insanity verdict. This varied background makes clear that\nno particular formulation has evolved into a baseline for due process,\nand that the insanity rule, like the conceptualization of criminal of\nfenses, is substantially open to state choice. Pp. 7\u201312.\n     (c) Nor does Arizona\u2019s abbreviation of the M\u2019Naghten statement\nraise a proper claim that some constitutional minimum has been\nshortchanged. Although Arizona\u2019s former statement of the full\nM\u2019Naghten rule was constitutionally adequate, the abbreviated rule\nis no less so, for cognitive incapacity is relevant under that state\nment, just as it was under the more extended formulation, and evi\ndence going to cognitive incapacity has the same significance under\nthe short form as it had under the long. Though Clark is correct that\napplying the moral incapacity test (telling right from wrong) does not\nnecessarily require evaluation of a defendant\u2019s cognitive capacity to\nappreciate the nature and quality of the acts charged against him,\nhis argument fails to recognize that cognitive incapacity is itself\nenough to demonstrate moral incapacity, so that evidence bearing on\nwhether the defendant knew the nature and quality of his actions is\nboth relevant and admissible. In practical terms, if a defendant did\nnot know what he was doing when he acted, he could not have known\nthat he was performing the wrongful act charged as a crime. The\nArizona appeals court acknowledged as much in this case. Clark\nadopted this very analysis in the trial court, which apparently agreed\nwhen it admitted his cognitive incapacity evidence for consideration\nunder the State\u2019s moral incapacity formulation. Clark can point to no\nevidence bearing on insanity that was excluded. Pp. 12\u201315.\n  2. The Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s Mott rule does not violate due\nprocess. Pp. 15\u201338.\n     (a) Mott held that testimony of a professional psychologist or psy\nchiatrist about a defendant\u2019s mental incapacity owing to mental dis\nease or defect was admissible, and could be considered, only for its\n4                           CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    bearing on an insanity defense, but could not be considered on the\n    element of mens rea. Of the three categories of evidence that poten\n    tially bear on mens rea\u2014(1) everyday \u201cobservation evidence\u201d either\n    by lay or expert witnesses of what Clark did or said, which may sup\n    port the professional diagnoses of disease and in any event is the\n    kind of evidence that can be relevant to show what was on Clark\u2019s\n    mind when he fired his gun; (2) \u201cmental-disease evidence,\u201d typically\n    from professional psychologists or psychiatrists based on factual re\n    ports, professional observations, and tests about Clark\u2019s mental dis\n    ease, with features described by the witness; and (3) \u201ccapacity evi\n    dence,\u201d typically by the same experts, about Clark\u2019s capacity for\n    cognition and moral judgment (and ultimately also his capacity to\n    form mens rea)\u2014Mott imposed no restriction on considering evidence\n    of the first sort, but applies to the latter two. Although the trial court\n    seems to have applied the Mott restriction to all three categories of\n    evidence Clark offered for the purpose of showing what he called his\n    inability to form the required mens rea, his objection to Mott\u2019s appli\n    cation does not turn on the distinction between lay and expert wit\n    nesses or the kinds of testimony they were competent to present.\n    Rather, the issue here is Clark\u2019s claim that the Mott rule violates due\n    process. Pp. 15\u201325.\n         (b) Clark\u2019s Mott challenge turns on the application of the pre\n    sumption of innocence in criminal cases, the presumption of sanity,\n    and the principle that a criminal defendant is entitled to present\n    relevant and favorable evidence on an element of the offense charged\n    against him. Pp. 25\u201330.\n           (i) The presumption of innocence is that a defendant is inno\n    cent unless and until the government proves beyond a reasonable\n    doubt each element of the offense changed, including the mental ele\n    ment or mens rea. The modern tendency is to describe the mens rea\n    required to prove particular offenses in specific terms, as shown in\n    the Arizona statute requiring the State to prove that in acting to kill\n    the victim, Clark intended to kill a law enforcement officer on duty or\n    knew that the victim was such an officer on duty. As applied to mens\n    rea (and every other element), the force of the presumption of inno\n    cence is measured by the force of the showing needed to overcome it,\n    which is proof beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant\u2019s state of\n    mind was in fact what the charge states. See In re Winship, 397\n    U. S. 358, 361\u2013363. Pp. 25\u201326.\n           (ii) The presumption of sanity dispenses with a requirement\n    that the government include as an element of every criminal charge\n    an allegation that the defendant had the capacity to form the mens\n    rea necessary for conviction and criminal responsibility. Unlike the\n    presumption of innocence, the presumption of sanity\u2019s force varies\n                    Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                      5\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nacross the many state and federal jurisdictions, and prior law has\nrecognized considerable leeway on the part of the legislative branch\nin defining the presumption\u2019s strength through the kind of evidence\nand degree of persuasiveness necessary to overcome it, see Fisher v.\nUnited States, 328 U. S. 463, 466\u2013476. There are two points where the\nsanity or capacity presumption may be placed in issue. First, a State\nmay allow a defendant to introduce (and a factfinder to consider) evi\ndence of mental disease or incapacity for the bearing it can have on\nthe government\u2019s burden to show mens rea. Second, the sanity pre\nsumption\u2019s force may be tested in the consideration of an insanity de\nfense raised by a defendant. Insanity rules like M\u2019Naghten and the\nvariants noted above are attempts to define or indicate the kinds of\nmental differences that overcome the presumption of sanity or capac\nity and therefore excuse a defendant from customary criminal re\nsponsibility, see, e.g., Jones v. United States, 463 U. S. 354, 373, n. 4,\neven if the prosecution has otherwise overcome the presumption of\ninnocence by convincing the factfinder of all the elements charged be\nyond a reasonable doubt. The burden a defendant raising the insan\nity issue must carry defines the strength of the sanity presumption.\nA State may, for example, place the burden of persuasion on a defen\ndant to prove insanity as the applicable law defines it, whether by a\npreponderance of the evidence or to some more convincing degree.\nSee, e.g., Leland v. Oregon, 343 U. S. 790, 798. Pp. 26\u201329.\n       (iii) A defendant has a due process right to present evidence\nfavorable to himself on an element that must be proven to convict\nhim. Evidence tending to show that a defendant suffers from mental\ndisease and lacks capacity to form mens rea is relevant to rebut evi\ndence that he did in fact form the required mens rea at the time in\nquestion. Thus, Clark claims a right to require the factfinder in this\ncase to consider testimony about his mental illness and his incapacity\ndirectly, when weighing the persuasiveness of other evidence tending\nto show mens rea, which the prosecution has the burden to prove.\nHowever, the right to introduce relevant evidence can be curtailed if\nthere is a good reason for doing so. For example, trial judges may\n\u201cexclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by certain other\nfactors such as unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or potential\nto mislead the jury.\u201d Holmes v. South Carolina, 547 U. S. ___, ___.\nAnd if evidence may be kept out entirely, its consideration may be\nsubject to limitation, which Arizona claims the power to impose here.\nUnder state law, mental-disease and capacity evidence may be con\nsidered only for its bearing on the insanity defense, and it will avail a\ndefendant only if it is persuasive enough to satisfy the defendant\u2019s\nburden as defined by the terms of that defense. Such evidence is thus\nbeing channeled or restricted to one issue; it is not being excluded en\n6                            CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    tirely, and the question is whether reasons for requiring it to be\n    channeled and restricted satisfy due process\u2019s fundamental fairness\n    standard. Pp. 29\u201330.\n          (c) The reasons supporting the Arizona rule satisfy due process.\n    Pp. 30\u201338.\n             (i) The first such reason is Arizona\u2019s authority to define its pre\n    sumption of sanity (or capacity or responsibility) by choosing an in\n    sanity definition and placing the burden of persuasion on criminal\n    defendants claiming incapacity as an excuse. Consistent with due\n    process, a State can require defendants to bear that burden, see\n    Leland, supra, at 797\u2013799, and Clark does not object to Arizona\u2019s deci\n    sion to require persuasion to a clear and convincing degree before the\n    presumption of sanity and normal responsibility is overcome. If a\n    State is to have this authority in practice as well as in theory, it must\n    be able to deny a defendant the opportunity to displace the sanity\n    presumption more easily when addressing a different issue during\n    the criminal trial. Yet just such an opportunity would be available if\n    expert testimony of mental disease and incapacity could be consid\n    ered for whatever a factfinder might think it was worth on the mens\n    rea issue. The sanity presumption would then be only as strong as\n    the evidence a factfinder would accept as enough to raise a reason\n    able doubt about mens rea; once reasonable doubt was found, acquit\n    tal would be required, and the standards established for the insanity\n    defense would go by the boards. What counts for due process is sim\n    ply that a State wishing to avoid a second avenue for exploring capac\n    ity, less stringent for a defendant, has a good reason for confining the\n    consideration of mental disease and incapacity evidence to the insan\n    ity defense. Pp. 30\u201332.\n             (ii) Arizona\u2019s rule also serves to avoid confusion and misunder\n    standing on the part of jurors. The controversial character of some\n    categories of mental disease, the potential of mental-disease evidence\n    to mislead, and the danger of according greater certainty to capacity\n    evidence than experts claim for it give rise to risks that may rea\n    sonably be hedged by channeling the consideration of such evidence\n    to the insanity issue on which, in States like Arizona, a defendant\n    has the burden of persuasion. First, the diagnosis may mask vigor\n    ous debate within the psychiatric profession about the very contours\n    of the mental disease itself. See, e.g., Jones, supra, at 364\u2013365, n. 13.\n    Though mental-disease evidence is certainly not condemned wholesale,\n    the consequence of this professional ferment is a general caution in\n    treating psychological classifications as predicates for excusing other\n    wise criminal conduct. Next, there is the potential of mental-disease\n    evidence to mislead jurors (when they are the factfinders) through\n    the power of this kind of evidence to suggest that a defendant suffer\n                      Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                      7\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  ing from a recognized mental disease lacks cognitive, moral, voli\n  tional, or other capacity, when that may not be a sound conclusion at\n  all. Even when a category of mental disease is broadly accepted and\n  the assignment of a defendant\u2019s behavior to that category is uncon\n  troversial, the classification may suggest something very significant\n  about a defendant\u2019s capacity, when in fact the classification tells little\n  or nothing about the defendant\u2019s ability to form mens rea or to exer\n  cise the cognitive, moral, or volitional capacities that define legal san\n  ity. The limits of the utility of a professional disease diagnosis are\n  evident in the dispute between the two testifying experts in this case;\n  they agree that Clark was schizophrenic, but they reach opposite con\n  clusions on whether his mental disease left him bereft of cognitive or\n  moral capacity. Finally, there are particular risks inherent in the\n  opinions of the experts who supplement the mental-disease classifica\n  tions with opinions on incapacity: on whether the mental disease\n  rendered a particular defendant incapable of the cognition necessary\n  for moral judgment or mens rea or otherwise incapable of under\n  standing the wrongfulness of the conduct charged. Unlike observa\n  tional evidence bearing on mens rea, capacity evidence consists of\n  judgment, and judgment is fraught with multiple perils. Although\n  such capacity judgments may be given in the utmost good faith, their\n  potentially tenuous character is indicated by the candor of the de\n  fense expert in this very case. He testified that Clark lacked the ca\n  pacity to appreciate the circumstances realistically and to under\n  stand the wrongfulness of what he was doing, but he admitted that\n  no one knew exactly what was on Clark\u2019s mind at the time of the\n  shooting. Even when an expert is confident that his understanding of\n  the mind is reliable, judgment addressing the basic categories of ca\n  pacity requires a leap from the concepts of psychology, which are de\n  vised for thinking about treatment, to the concepts of legal sanity,\n  which are devised for thinking about criminal responsibility. Pp. 33\u2013\n  38.\n       (d) For these reasons, there is also no cause to claim that chan\n  neling evidence on mental disease and capacity offends any \u201c \u2018princi\n  ple of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people\n  as to be ranked as fundamental,\u2019 \u201d Patterson, supra, at 202.

Ann. \u00a713\u20131105(A)(3) (West Supp. 2005) for\nintentionally or knowingly killing a law enforcement\nofficer in the line of duty.1 In March 2001, Clark was\nfound incompetent to stand trial and was committed to a\nstate hospital for treatment, but two years later the same\ntrial court found his competence restored and ordered him\nto be tried. Clark waived his right to a jury, and the case\nwas heard by the court.\n   At trial, Clark did not contest the shooting and death,\nbut relied on his undisputed paranoid schizophrenia at the\ntime of the incident in denying that he had the specific\nintent to shoot a law enforcement officer or knowledge\nthat he was doing so, as required by the statute. Accord\ningly, the prosecutor offered circumstantial evidence that\nClark knew Officer Moritz was a law enforcement officer.\nThe evidence showed that the officer was in uniform at the\ntime, that he caught up with Clark in a marked police car\nwith emergency lights and siren going, and that Clark\nacknowledged the symbols of police authority and stopped.\nThe testimony for the prosecution indicated that Clark\nhad intentionally lured an officer to the scene to kill him,\nhaving told some people a few weeks before the incident\nthat he wanted to shoot police officers. At the close of the\nState\u2019s evidence, the trial court denied Clark\u2019s motion for\njudgment of acquittal for failure to prove intent to kill a\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Section\n           13\u20131105(A)(3) provides that \u201c[a] person commits first degree\nmurder if . . . [i]ntending or knowing that the person\u2019s conduct will\ncause death to a law enforcement officer, the person causes the death of\na law enforcement officer who is in the line of duty.\u201d\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw enforcement officer or knowledge that Officer Moritz\nwas a law enforcement officer.\n   In presenting the defense case, Clark claimed mental\nillness, which he sought to introduce for two purposes.\nFirst, he raised the affirmative defense of insanity, putting\nthe burden on himself to prove by clear and convincing\nevidence, \u00a713\u2013502(C) (West 2001), that \u201cat the time of the\ncommission of the criminal act [he] was afflicted with a\nmental disease or defect of such severity that [he] did not\nknow the criminal act was wrong,\u201d \u00a713\u2013502(A).2 Second,\nhe aimed to rebut the prosecution\u2019s evidence of the requi\nsite mens rea, that he had acted intentionally or know\ningly to kill a law enforcement officer. See, e.g., Record in\nNo. CR 2000\u2013538 (Ariz. Super. Ct.), Doc. 374 (hereinafter\nRecord).\n   The trial court ruled that Clark could not rely on evi\ndence bearing on insanity to dispute the mens rea. The\ncourt cited State v. Mott, 187 Ariz. 536, 931 P. 2d 1046 (en\nbanc), cert. denied, 520 U. S. 1234 (1997), which \u201crefused\nto allow psychiatric testimony to negate specific intent,\u201d\n187 Ariz., at 541, 931 P. 2d, at 1051, and held that \u201cAri\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Section 13\u2013502(A) provides in full that\n\n\u201cA person may be found guilty except insane if at the time of the\ncommission of the criminal act the person was afflicted with a mental\ndisease or defect of such severity that the person did not know the\ncriminal act was wrong. A mental disease or defect constituting legal\ninsanity is an affirmative defense. Mental disease or defect does not\ninclude disorders that result from acute voluntary intoxication or\nwithdrawal from alcohol or drugs, character defects, psychosexual\ndisorders or impulse control disorders. Conditions that do not consti\ntute legal insanity include but are not limited to momentary, temporary\nconditions arising from the pressure of the circumstances, moral\ndecadence, depravity or passion growing out of anger, jealousy, revenge,\nhatred or other motives in a person who does not suffer from a mental\ndisease or defect or an abnormality that is manifested only by criminal\nconduct.\u201d\n  A defendant found \u201cguilty except insane\u201d is committed to a state\nmental health facility for treatment. See \u00a713\u2013502(D).\n4                        CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nzona does not allow evidence of a defendant\u2019s mental\ndisorder short of insanity . . . to negate the mens rea ele\nment of a crime,\u201d ibid.3\n   As to his insanity, then, Clark presented testimony from\nclassmates, school officials, and his family describing his\nincreasingly bizarre behavior over the year before the\nshooting. Witnesses testified, for example, that paranoid\ndelusions led Clark to rig a fishing line with beads and\nwind chimes at home to alert him to intrusion by invaders,\nand to keep a bird in his automobile to warn of airborne\npoison. There was lay and expert testimony that Clark\nthought Flagstaff was populated with \u201caliens\u201d (some im\npersonating government agents), the \u201caliens\u201d were trying\nto kill him, and bullets were the only way to stop them. A\npsychiatrist testified that Clark was suffering from para\nnoid schizophrenia with delusions about \u201caliens\u201d when he\nkilled Officer Moritz, and he concluded that Clark was\nincapable of luring the officer or understanding right from\nwrong and that he was thus insane at the time of the\nkilling. In rebuttal, a psychiatrist for the State gave his\nopinion that Clark\u2019s paranoid schizophrenia did not keep\nhim from appreciating the wrongfulness of his conduct, as\nshown by his actions before and after the shooting (such as\ncircling the residential block with music blaring as if to\nlure the police to intervene, evading the police after the\nshooting, and hiding the gun).\n   At the close of the defense case consisting of this evi\ndence bearing on mental illness, the trial court denied\nClark\u2019s renewed motion for a directed verdict grounded on\nfailure of the prosecution to show that Clark knew the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The trial court permitted Clark to introduce this evidence, whether\n\nprimarily going to insanity or lack of intent, \u201cbecause it goes to the\ninsanity issue and because we\u2019re not in front of a jury.\u201d App. 9. It also\nallowed him to make an offer of proof as to intent to preserve the issue\non appeal. Ibid.\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nvictim was a police officer.4 The judge then issued a spe\ncial verdict of first-degree murder, expressly finding that\nClark shot and caused the death of Officer Moritz beyond\na reasonable doubt and that Clark had not shown that he\nwas insane at the time. The judge noted that though\nClark was indisputably afflicted with paranoid schizo\nphrenia at the time of the shooting, the mental illness \u201cdid\nnot . . . distort his perception of reality so severely that he\ndid not know his actions were wrong.\u201d App. 334. For this\nconclusion, the judge expressly relied on \u201cthe facts of the\ncrime, the evaluations of the experts, [Clark\u2019s] actions and\nbehavior both before and after the shooting, and the ob\nservations of those that knew [Clark].\u201d Id., at 333. The\nsentence was life imprisonment without the possibility of\nrelease for 25 years.\n   Clark moved to vacate the judgment and sentence,\narguing, among other things, that Arizona\u2019s insanity test\nand its Mott rule each violate due process. As to the in\nsanity standard, Clark claimed (as he had argued earlier)\nthat the Arizona Legislature had impermissibly narrowed\nits standard in 1993 when it eliminated the first part of\nthe two-part insanity test announced in M\u2019Naghten\u2019s Case,\n10 Cl. & Fin. 200, 8 Eng. Rep. 718 (1843). The court de\nnied the motion.\n   The Court of Appeals of Arizona affirmed Clark\u2019s convic\ntion, treating the conclusion on sanity as supported by\nenough evidence to withstand review for abuse of discre\ntion, and holding the State\u2019s insanity scheme consistent\nwith due process. App. 336. As to the latter, the Court of\nAppeals reasoned that there is no constitutional require\nment to recognize an insanity defense at all, the bounds of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Clark did not at this time make an additional offer of proof, as con\ntemplated by the trial court when it ruled that it would consider\nevidence bearing on insanity as to insanity but not as to mens rea. See\nn. 3, supra.\n6                    CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich are left to the State\u2019s discretion. Beyond that, the\nappellate court followed Mott, reading it as barring the\ntrial court\u2019s consideration of evidence of Clark\u2019s mental\nillness and capacity directly on the element of mens rea.\nThe Supreme Court of Arizona denied further review.\n   We granted certiorari to decide whether due process\nprohibits Arizona from thus narrowing its insanity test or\nfrom excluding evidence of mental illness and incapacity\ndue to mental illness to rebut evidence of the requisite\ncriminal intent. 546 U. S. ___ (2005). We now affirm.\n                             II\n  Clark first says that Arizona\u2019s definition of insanity,\nbeing only a fragment of the Victorian standard from\nwhich it derives, violates due process. The landmark\nEnglish rule in M\u2019Naghten\u2019s Case, 10 Cl. & Fin. 200, 8\nEng. Rep. 718 (1843), states that\n    \u201cthe jurors ought to be told . . . that to establish a de\n    fence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly\n    proved that, at the time of the committing of the act,\n    the party accused was laboring under such a defect of\n    reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the\n    nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he\n    did know it, that he did not know he was doing what\n    was wrong.\u201d 10 Cl. & Fin., at 210, 8 Eng. Rep., at 722.\nThe first part asks about cognitive capacity: whether a\nmental defect leaves a defendant unable to understand\nwhat he is doing. The second part presents an ostensibly\nalternative basis for recognizing a defense of insanity\nunderstood as a lack of moral capacity: whether a mental\ndisease or defect leaves a defendant unable to understand\nthat his action is wrong.\n  When the Arizona Legislature first codified an insanity\nrule, it adopted the full M\u2019Naghten statement (subject to\nmodifications in details that do not matter here):\n                    Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                  7\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n     \u201cA person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at\n     the time of such conduct the person was suffering\n     from such a mental disease or defect as not to know\n     the nature and quality of the act or, if such person did\n     know, that such person did not know that what he\n     was doing was wrong.\u201d Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a713\u2013502\n     (West 1978).5\nIn 1993, the legislature dropped the cognitive incapacity\npart, leaving only moral incapacity as the nub of the\nstated definition. See 1993 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 256, \u00a7\u00a72\u2013\n3.6 Under current Arizona law, a defendant will not be\nadjudged insane unless he demonstrates that \u201cat the time\nof the commission of the criminal act [he] was afflicted\nwith a mental disease or defect of such severity that [he]\ndid not know the criminal act was wrong,\u201d Ariz. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. \u00a713\u2013502(A) (West 2001).\n                              A\n  Clark challenges the 1993 amendment excising the\nexpress reference to the cognitive incapacity element. He\ninsists that the side-by-side M\u2019Naghten test represents the\nminimum that a government must provide in recognizing\nan alternative to criminal responsibility on grounds of\nmental illness or defect, and he argues that elimination of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 This statutory standard followed the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s dec\n\nlaration that Arizona has \u201cuniformly adhered\u201d to the two-part\nM\u2019Naghten standard. State v. Schantz, 98 Ariz. 200, 206, 403 P. 2d\n521, 525 (1965) (citing cases), cert. denied, 382 U. S. 1015 (1966).\n  6 This change was accompanied by others, principally an enumeration\n\nof mental states excluded from the category of \u201cmental disease or\ndefect,\u201d such as voluntary intoxication and other conditions, and a\nchange of the insanity verdict from \u201cnot responsible for criminal con\nduct\u201d by reason of insanity to \u201cguilty except insane.\u201d See 1993 Ariz.\nSess. Laws ch. 256, \u00a7\u00a72\u20133. The 1993 amendments were prompted, at\nleast in part, by an acquittal by reason of insanity in a murder case.\nSee Note, Arizona\u2019s Insane Response to Insanity, 40 Ariz. L. Rev. 287,\n290 (1998).\n8                        CLARK v.

New York, 432 U. S. 197, 202 (1977) (quoting\nSpeiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513, 523 (1958)); see also\nLeland v. Oregon, 343 U. S. 790, 798 (1952).\n  The claim entails no light burden, see Montana v. Egel\nhoff, 518 U. S. 37, 43 (1996) (plurality opinion), and Clark\ndoes not carry it.        History shows no deference to\nM\u2019Naghten that could elevate its formula to the level of\nfundamental principle, so as to limit the traditional recog\nnition of a State\u2019s capacity to define crimes and defenses,\nsee Patterson, supra, at 210; see also Foucha v. Louisiana,\n504 U. S. 71, 96 (1992) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).\n  Even a cursory examination of the traditional Anglo-\nAmerican approaches to insanity reveals significant dif\nferences among them, with four traditional strains vari\nously combined to yield a diversity of American standards.\nThe main variants are the cognitive incapacity, the moral\nincapacity, the volitional incapacity, and the product-of\nmental-illness tests.7 The first two emanate from the\nalternatives stated in the M\u2019Naghten rule. The volitional\nincapacity or irresistible-impulse test, which surfaced over\ntwo centuries ago (first in England,8 then in this country9),\nasks whether a person was so lacking in volition due to a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 \u201cCapacity\u201d is understood to mean the ability to form a certain state\n\nof mind or motive, understand or evaluate one\u2019s actions, or control\nthem.\n  8 See Queen v. Oxford, 9 Car. & P. 525, 546, 173 Eng. Rep. 941, 950\n\n(1840) (\u201cIf some controlling disease was, in truth, the acting power\nwithin [the defendant] which he could not resist, then he will not be\nresponsible\u201d); Hadfield\u2019s Case, 27 How.

And the product-of-mental-illness test was\nused as early as 1870,10 and simply asks whether a per\nson\u2019s action was a product of a mental disease or defect.11\nSeventeen States and the Federal Government have\nadopted a recognizable version of the M\u2019Naghten test with\nboth its cognitive incapacity and moral incapacity compo\nnents.12 One State has adopted only M\u2019Naghten\u2019s cogni\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 State v.

H. 399\n\n(1870).\n  11 This distillation of the Anglo-American insanity standards into\n\ncombinations of four building blocks should not be read to signify that\nno other components contribute to these insanity standards or that\nthere are no material distinctions between jurisdictions testing insanity\nwith the same building blocks. For example, the jurisdictions limit, in\nvarying degrees, which sorts of mental illness or defect can give rise to\na successful insanity defense. Compare, e.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a713\u2013\n502(A) (West 2001) (excluding from definition of \u201cmental disease or\ndefect\u201d acute voluntary intoxication, withdrawal from alcohol or drugs,\ncharacter defects, psychosexual disorders, and impulse control disor\nders) with, e.g., Ind.

ARIZONA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwith the medical concepts of mental abnormality that\ninfluence the expert opinion testimony by psychologists\nand psychiatrists commonly introduced to support or\ncontest insanity claims. For medical definitions devised to\njustify treatment, like legal ones devised to excuse from\nconventional criminal responsibility, are subject to flux\nand disagreement. See infra, at 31\u201333; cf. Leland, 343\nU. S., at 800\u2013801 (no due process violation for adopting the\nM\u2019Naghten standard rather than the irresistible-impulse\ntest because scientific knowledge does not require other\nwise and choice of test is a matter of policy). There being\nsuch fodder for reasonable debate about what the cognate\nlegal and medical tests should be, due process imposes no\nsingle canonical formulation of legal insanity.\n                             B\n   Nor does Arizona\u2019s abbreviation of the M\u2019Naghten\nstatement raise a proper claim that some constitutional\nminimum has been shortchanged. Clark\u2019s argument of\ncourse assumes that Arizona\u2019s former statement of the\nM\u2019Naghten rule, with its express alternative of cognitive\nincapacity, was constitutionally adequate (as we agree).\nThat being so, the abbreviated rule is no less so, for cogni\ntive incapacity is relevant under that statement, just as it\nwas under the more extended formulation, and evidence\ngoing to cognitive incapacity has the same significance\nunder the short form as it had under the long.\n   Though Clark is correct that the application of the\nmoral incapacity test (telling right from wrong) does not\nnecessarily require evaluation of a defendant\u2019s cognitive\ncapacity to appreciate the nature and quality of the acts\ncharged against him, see Brief for Petitioner 46\u201347, his\nargument fails to recognize that cognitive incapacity is\nitself enough to demonstrate moral incapacity. Cognitive\nincapacity, in other words, is a sufficient condition for\nestablishing a defense of insanity, albeit not a necessary\n                    Cite as: 548 U.

As a defendant can therefore make out moral inca\npacity by demonstrating cognitive incapacity, evidence\nbearing on whether the defendant knew the nature and\nquality of his actions is both relevant and admissible. In\npractical terms, if a defendant did not know what he was\ndoing when he acted, he could not have known that he was\nperforming the wrongful act charged as a crime.23 Indeed,\nwhen the two-part rule was still in effect, the Supreme\nCourt of Arizona held that a jury instruction on insanity\ncontaining the moral incapacity part but not a full recita\ntion of the cognitive incapacity part was fine, as the cogni\ntive incapacity part might be \u201c \u2018treated as adding nothing\nto the requirement that the accused know his act was\nwrong.\u2019 \u201d State v. Chavez, 143 Ariz. 238, 239, 693 P. 2d\n893, 894 (1984) (quoting A. Goldstein, The Insanity De\nfense 50 (1967)).\n   The Court of Appeals of Arizona acknowledged as much\nin this case, too, see App. 350 (\u201cIt is difficult to imagine\nthat a defendant who did not appreciate the \u2018nature and\nquality\u2019 of the act he committed would reasonably be able\nto perceive that the act was \u2018wrong\u2019 \u201d), and thus aligned\nitself with the long-accepted understanding that the cogni\ntively incapacitated are a subset of the morally incapaci\ntated within the meaning of the standard M\u2019Naghten rule,\nsee, e.g., Goldstein, supra, at 51 (\u201cIn those situations\nwhere the accused does not know the nature and quality of\nhis act, in the broad sense, he will not know that it was\nwrong, no matter what construction \u2018wrong\u2019 is given\u201d); 1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  23He  might, of course, have thought delusively he was doing some\nthing just as wrongful as the act charged against him, but this is not\nthe test: he must have understood that he was committing the act\ncharged and that it was wrongful, see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a713\u2013502(A)\n(West 2001) (\u201cA person may be found guilty except insane if at the time\nof the commission of the criminal act the person was afflicted with a\nmental disease or defect of such severity that the person did not know\nthe criminal act was wrong\u201d).\n14                         CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nW. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a77.2(b)(3), p. 536\n(2d ed. 2003) (\u201cMany courts feel that knowledge of \u2018the\nnature and quality of the act\u2019 is the mere equivalent of the\nability to know that the act was wrong\u201d (citing cases)); id.,\n\u00a77.2(b)(4), at 537 (\u201cIf the defendant does not know the\nnature and quality of his act, then quite obviously he does\nnot know that his act is \u2018wrong,\u2019 and this is true without\nregard to the interpretation given to the word \u2018wrong\u2019 \u201d); cf.\n1 R. Gerber, Criminal Law of Arizona 502\u20137, n. 1 (2d ed.\n1993).24\n  Clark, indeed, adopted this very analysis himself in the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   24 We think this logic holds true in the face of the usual rule of statu\n\ntory construction of \u201c \u2018 \u201cgiv[ing] effect, if possible, to every clause and\nword of a statute,\u201d \u2019 \u201d Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001) (quot\ning United States v. Menasche, 348 U. S. 528, 538\u2013539 (1955)); see also 2\nJ. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a74705 (3d ed. 1943).\nInsanity standards are formulated to guide the factfinder to determine the\nblameworthiness of a mentally ill defendant. See, e.g., Jones v. United\nStates, 463 U. S. 354, 373, n. 4 (1983) (Brennan, J., dissenting). The\nM\u2019Naghten test is a sequential test, first asking the factfinder to conduct\nthe easier enquiry whether a defendant knew the nature and quality of\nhis actions. If not, the defendant is to be considered insane and there is no\nneed to pass to the harder and broader enquiry whether the defendant\nknew his actions were wrong. And, because, owing to this sequence, the\nfactfinder is to ask whether a defendant lacks moral capacity only when\nhe possesses cognitive capacity, the only defendants who will be found to\nlack moral capacity are those possessing cognitive capacity. Cf. 2 C.\nTorcia, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7101 (15th ed. 1994). Though, before\n1993, Arizona had in place the full M\u2019Naghten test with this sequential\nenquiry, see, e.g., Schantz, 98 Ariz., at 207, 403 P. 2d, at 525, it would\nappear that the legislature eliminated the cognitive capacity part not to\nchange the meaning of the insanity standard but to implement its judg\nment that a streamlined standard with only the moral capacity part\nwould be easier for the jury to apply, see Arizona House of Representative\nJudiciary Committee Notes 3 (Mar. 18, 1993); 1 R. Gerber, Criminal Law\nof Arizona 502\u20136, 502\u201311 (2d ed. 1993 and Supp. 2000). This is corrobo\nrated by the State\u2019s choice for many years against revising the applicable\nrecommended jury instruction (enumerating the complete M\u2019Naghten test)\nin order to match the amended statutory standard.

S. ____ (2006)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntrial court: \u201c[I]f [Clark] did not know he was shooting at a\npolice officer, or believed he had to shoot or be shot, even\nthough his belief was not based in reality, this would\nestablish that he did not know what he was doing was\nwrong.\u201d Record, Doc. 374, at 1. The trial court apparently\nagreed, for the judge admitted Clark\u2019s evidence of cogni\ntive incapacity for consideration under the State\u2019s moral\nincapacity formulation. And Clark can point to no evi\ndence bearing on insanity that was excluded. His psychi\natric expert and a number of lay witnesses testified to his\ndelusions, and this evidence tended to support a descrip\ntion of Clark as lacking the capacity to understand that\nthe police officer was a human being. There is no doubt\nthat the trial judge considered the evidence as going to an\nissue of cognitive capacity, for in finding insanity not\nproven he said that Clark\u2019s mental illness \u201cdid not . . .\ndistort his perception of reality so severely that he did not\nknow his actions were wrong,\u201d App. 334.\n   We are satisfied that neither in theory nor in practice\ndid Arizona\u2019s 1993 abridgment of the insanity formulation\ndeprive Clark of due process.\n                             III\n  Clark\u2019s second claim of a due process violation chal\nlenges the rule adopted by the Supreme Court of Arizona\nin State v. Mott, 187 Ariz. 536, 931 P. 2d 1046 (en banc),\ncert. denied, 520 U. S. 1234 (1997). This case ruled on the\nadmissibility of testimony from a psychologist offered to\nshow that the defendant suffered from battered women\u2019s\nsyndrome and therefore lacked the capacity to form the\nmens rea of the crime charged against her. The opinion\nvariously referred to the testimony in issue as \u201cpsychologi\ncal testimony,\u201d 187 Ariz., at 541, 931 P. 2d, at 1051, and\n\u201cexpert testimony,\u201d ibid., and implicitly equated it with\n\u201cexpert psychiatric evidence,\u201d id., at 540, 931 P. 2d, at\n1050 (internal quotation marks omitted), and \u201cpsychiatric\n16                       CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntestimony,\u201d id., at 541, 931 P. 2d, at 1051.25 The state\ncourt held that testimony of a professional psychologist or\npsychiatrist about a defendant\u2019s mental incapacity owing\nto mental disease or defect was admissible, and could be\nconsidered, only for its bearing on an insanity defense;\nsuch evidence could not be considered on the element of\nmens rea, that is, what the State must show about a de\nfendant\u2019s mental state (such as intent or understanding)\nwhen he performed the act charged against him. See id.,\nat 541, 544, 931 P. 2d, at 1051, 1054.26\n                             A\n   Understanding Clark\u2019s claim requires attention to the\ncategories of evidence with a potential bearing on mens\nrea. First, there is \u201cobservation evidence\u201d in the everyday\nsense, testimony from those who observed what Clark did\nand heard what he said; this category would also include\ntestimony that an expert witness might give about Clark\u2019s\ntendency to think in a certain way and his behavioral\ncharacteristics. This evidence may support a professional\ndiagnosis of mental disease and in any event is the kind of\nevidence that can be relevant to show what in fact was on\nClark\u2019s mind when he fired the gun. Observation evidence\nin the record covers Clark\u2019s behavior at home and with\nfriends, his expressions of belief around the time of the\nkilling that \u201caliens\u201d were inhabiting the bodies of local\npeople (including government agents),27 his driving around\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  25 We thus think the dissent reads Mott too broadly. See post, at 6\u20137\n\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (no distinction between observation and\nmental-disease testimony, see infra, at 16\u201317, or lay and expert).\n  26 The more natural reading of Mott suggests to us that this evidence\n\ncannot be considered as to mens rea even if the defendant establishes\nhis insanity, though one might read Mott otherwise.\n  27 Clark\u2019s parents testified that, in the months before the shooting\n\nand even days beforehand, Clark called them \u201caliens\u201d and thought that\n\u201caliens\u201d were out to get him. See, e.g., Tr. of Bench Trial in No. CR\n2000\u2013538, pp. 110\u2013112, 136, 226\u2013228 (Aug. 20, 2003). One night before\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

As was\ntrue here, this evidence characteristically but not always28\ncomes from professional psychologists or psychiatrists who\ntestify as expert witnesses and base their opinions in part\non examination of a defendant, usually conducted after the\nevents in question. The thrust of this evidence was that,\nbased on factual reports, professional observations, and\ntests, Clark was psychotic at the time in question, with a\ncondition that fell within the category of schizophrenia.\n  Third, there is evidence we will refer to as \u201ccapacity\nevidence\u201d about a defendant\u2019s capacity for cognition and\nmoral judgment (and ultimately also his capacity to form\nmens rea). This, too, is opinion evidence. Here, as it\nusually does,29 this testimony came from the same experts\nand concentrated on those specific details of the mental\ncondition that make the difference between sanity and\ninsanity under the Arizona definition.30 In their respec\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe shooting, according to Clark\u2019s mother, Clark repeatedly viewed a\npopular film characterized by her as telling a story about \u201caliens\u201d\nmasquerading as government agents, a story Clark insisted was real\ndespite his mother\u2019s protestations to the contrary. See id., at 59\u201360\n(Aug. 21, 2003). And two months after the shooting, Clark purportedly\ntold his parents that his hometown, Flagstaff, was inhabited principally\nby \u201caliens,\u201d who had to be stopped, and that the only way to stop them\nwas with bullets. See, e.g., id., at 131\u2013132 (Aug. 20, 2003); id., at 24\u201325\n(Aug. 21, 2003).\n  28 This is contrary to the dissent\u2019s understanding. See post, at 2\u20133\n\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.).\n  29 In conflict with the dissent\u2019s characterization, see post, at 2 (opin\n\nion of KENNEDY, J.), it does not always, however, come from experts.\n  30Arizona permits capacity evidence, see, e.g., State v. Sanchez, 117\n18                        CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntive testimony on these details the experts disagreed: the\ndefense expert gave his opinion that the symptoms or\neffects of the disease in Clark\u2019s case included inability to\nappreciate the nature of his action and to tell that it was\nwrong, whereas the State\u2019s psychiatrist was of the view\nthat Clark was a schizophrenic who was still sufficiently\nable to appreciate the reality of shooting the officer and to\nknow that it was wrong to do that.31\n   A caveat about these categories is in order. They at\ntempt to identify different kinds of testimony offered in\nthis case in terms of explicit and implicit distinctions\nmade in Mott. What we can say about these categories\ngoes to their cores, however, not their margins. Exact\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAriz. 369, 373, 573 P. 2d 60, 64 (1977); see also Ariz.

See, e.g., Fed.

See State v. Bay, 150 Ariz. 112, 116, 722\nP. 2d 280, 284 (1986). According to Bay, \u201c[f]oundationally, a lay wit\nness must have had an opportunity to observe the past conduct and\nhistory of a defendant; the fact that he is a lay witness goes not to the\nadmissibility of the testimony but rather to its weight.\u201d Ibid. (citation\nomitted); see also State v. Hughes, 193 Ariz. 72, 83, 969 P. 2d 1184,\n1195 (1998). In fact, a defendant can theoretically establish insanity\nsolely via lay testimony.

We read the Mott restriction to apply, rather, to\nevidence addressing the two issues in testimony that\ncharacteristically comes only from psychologists or psy\nchiatrists qualified to give opinions as expert witnesses:\nmental-disease evidence (whether at the time of the crime\na defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect, such\nas schizophrenia) and capacity evidence (whether the\ndisease or defect left him incapable of performing or ex\nperiencing a mental process defined as necessary for san\nity such as appreciating the nature and quality of his act\nand knowing that it was wrong).\n   Mott was careful to distinguish this kind of opinion\nevidence from observation evidence generally and even\nfrom observation evidence that an expert witness might\noffer, such as descriptions of a defendant\u2019s tendency to\nthink in a certain way or his behavioral characteristics;\nthe Arizona court made it clear that this sort of testimony\nwas perfectly admissible to rebut the prosecution\u2019s evi\ndence of mens rea, 187 Ariz., at 544, 931 P. 2d, at 1054.\nThus, only opinion testimony going to mental defect or\ndisease, and its effect on the cognitive or moral capaci\nties on which sanity depends under the Arizona rule, is\nrestricted.\n20                       CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  In this case, the trial court seems to have applied the\nMott restriction to all evidence offered by Clark for the\npurpose of showing what he called his inability to form the\nrequired mens rea, see, e.g., Record, Doc. 406, pp. 7\u201310,\n(that is, an intent to kill a police officer on duty, or an\nunderstanding that he was engaging in the act of killing\nsuch an officer, see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a713\u20131105(A)(3)\n(West Supp. 2005)). Thus, the trial court\u2019s restriction may\nhave covered not only mental-disease and capacity evi\ndence as just defined, but also observation evidence of\nfered by lay (and expert) witnesses who described Clark\u2019s\nunusual behavior. Clark\u2019s objection to the application of\nthe Mott rule does not, however, turn on the distinction\nbetween lay and expert witnesses or the kinds of testi\nmony they were competent to present.32\n                              C\n   There is some, albeit limited, disagreement between the\ndissent and ourselves about the scope of the claim of error\nproperly before us. To start with matters of agreement, all\nMembers of the Court agree that Clark\u2019s general attack on\nthe Mott rule covers its application in confining considera\ntion of capacity evidence to the insanity defense.\n   In practical terms, our agreement on issues presented\nextends to a second point. JUSTICE KENNEDY understands\nthat Clark raised an objection to confining mental-disease\nevidence to the insanity issue. As he sees it, Clark in\neffect claimed that in dealing with the issue of mens rea\nthe trial judge should have considered expert testimony on\nwhat may characteristically go through the mind of a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  32 With respect to \u201cthe limited factual issues the trial court held it\n\ncould consider under [Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7]13\u2013502 and Mott, defense\ncounsel made no additional \u2018offer of proof\u2019 at the conclusion of the case\nbut preserved [Clark\u2019s] legal contentions by asking the court to consider\nall of the evidence presented in determining whether the state had\nproved its case.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 10, n. 20 (citations omitted).\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nschizophrenic, when the judge considered what in fact was\nin Clark\u2019s mind at the time of the shooting. See post, at 3\n(dissenting opinion) (\u201c[T]he opinion that Clark had para\nnoid schizophrenia\u2014an opinion shared by experts for both\nthe prosecution and defense\u2014bears on efforts to deter\nmine, as a factual matter, whether he knew he was killing\na police officer\u201d). He thus understands that defense coun\nsel claimed a right to rebut the State\u2019s mens rea demon\nstration with testimony about how schizophrenics may\nhallucinate voices and other sounds, about their character\nistic failure to distinguish the content of their imagination\nfrom what most people perceive as exterior reality, and so\non. It is important to be clear that this supposed objection\nwas not about dealing with testimony based on observa\ntion of Clark showing that he had auditory hallucinations\nwhen he was driving around, or failed in fact to appreciate\nobjective reality when he shot; this objection went to use of\ntestimony about schizophrenics, not about Clark in par\nticular. While we might dispute how clearly Clark raised\nthis objection, we have no doubt that the objection falls\nwithin a general challenge to the Mott rule; we understand\nthat Mott is meant to confine to the insanity defense any\nconsideration of characteristic behavior associated with\nmental disease, see 187 Ariz., at 544, 931 P. 2d, at 1054\n(contrasting State v. Christensen, 129 Ariz. 32, 628 P. 2d\n580 (1991), and State v. Gonzales, 140 Ariz. 349, 681 P. 2d\n1368 (1984)). We will therefore assume for argument that\nClark raised this claim, as we consider the due process\nchallenge to the Mott rule.\n   The point on which we disagree with the dissent, how\never, is this: did Clark apprise the Arizona courts that he\nbelieved the trial judge had erroneously limited the con\nsideration of observation evidence, whether from lay wit\nnesses like Clark\u2019s mother or (possibly) the expert wit\nnesses who observed him? This sort of evidence was not\ncovered by the Mott restriction, and confining it to the\n22                        CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ninsanity issue would have been an erroneous application\nof Mott as a matter of Arizona law. For the following\nreasons we think no such objection was made in a way the\nArizona courts could have understood it, and that no such\nissue is before us now. We think the only issue properly\nbefore us is the challenge to Mott on due process grounds,\ncomprising objections to limits on the use of mental-\ndisease and capacity evidence.\n  It is clear that the trial judge intended to apply Mott:\n     \u201c[R]ecognizing that much of the evidence that [the de\n     fense is] going to be submitting, in fact all of it, as far\n     as I know . . . that has to do with the insanity could\n     also arguably be made along the lines of the Mott is\n     sue as to form and intent and his capacity for the in\n     tent. I\u2019m going to let you go ahead and get all that\n     stuff in because it goes to the insanity issue and be\n     cause we\u2019re not in front of a jury. At the end, I\u2019ll let\n     you make an offer of proof as to the intent, the Mott\n     issues, but I still think the supreme court decision is\n     the law of the land in this state.\u201d App. 9.\n  At no point did the trial judge specify any particular\nevidence that he refused to consider on the mens rea issue.\nNor did defense counsel specify any observation or other\nparticular evidence that he claimed was admissible but\nwrongly excluded on the issue of mens rea, so as to pro\nduce a clearer ruling on what evidence was being re\nstricted on the authority of Mott and what was not. He\nmade no \u201coffer of proof\u201d in the trial court;33 and although\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  33 We do not agree with the State\u2019s argument that the failure to make\n\nan offer of proof, see n. 4, supra, is a bar to pressing Clark\u2019s claim about\nthe admissibility of mental-illness or capacity evidence as to mens rea,\nsee Brief for Respondent 27\u201329, especially when the Arizona Court of\nAppeals rejected Clark\u2019s argument on the merits rather than clearly on\nthis ground, see App. 351\u2013353; see also Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S.\n1032, 1042 (1983) (\u201c[I]t is not clear from the opinion itself that the state\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

Ct. App.), pp. 48\u201349 (hereinafter Appellant\u2019s\nOpening Brief), he was no more specific than that, see,\ne.g., id., at 52 (\u201cThe Court\u2019s ruling in Mott and the trial\ncourt\u2019s refusal to consider whether as a result of suffering\nfrom paranoid schizophrenia [Clark] could not formulate\nthe mens rea necessary for first degree murder violated his\nright to due process\u201d). Similarly, we read the Arizona\nCourt of Appeals to have done nothing more than rely on\nMott to reject the claim that due process forbids restricting\nevidence bearing on \u201c[a]bility to [f]orm [m]ens [r]ea,\u201d App.\n351 (emphasis in original), (i.e., mental-disease and capac\nity evidence) to the insanity determination. See id., at\n351\u2013353.\n   This failure in the state courts to raise any clear claim\nabout observation evidence, see Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief\n46\u201352, is reflected in the material addressed to us, see\nBrief for Petitioner 13\u201332. In this Court both the question\npresented and the following statement of his position were\ncouched in similarly worded general terms:\n     \u201cI. ERIC WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS WHEN THE\n     TRIAL    COURT    REFUSED  TO   CONSIDER\n     EVIDENCE OF HIS SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS IN\n     DETERMINING FACTUALLY WHETHER THE\n     PROSECUTION      PROVED    THE   MENTAL\n     ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME CHARGED.\u201d Id., at 13.\nBut as his counsel made certain beyond doubt in his reply\nbrief, \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ncourt relied upon an adequate and independent state ground and . . . it \n\nfairly appears that the state court rested its decision primarily on\nfederal law\u201d).\n24                        CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n     \u201cEric\u2019s Point I is and always has been an attack on the\n     rule of State v. Mott, which both courts below held ap\n     plicable and binding. Mott announced a categorical\n     \u2018rejection of the use of psychological testimony to chal\n     lenge the mens rea element of a crime,\u2019 and upheld\n     this rule against federal due process challenge.\u201d Re\n     ply Brief for Petitioner 2 (citations omitted).\nThis explanation is supported by other statements in\nClark\u2019s briefs in both the State Court of Appeals and this\nCourt, replete with the consistently maintained claim that\nit was error to limit evidence of mental illness and inca\npacity to its bearing on the insanity defense, excluding it\nfrom consideration on the element of mens rea. See, e.g.,\nAppellant\u2019s Opening Brief 46, 47, 51; Brief for Petitioner\n11, 13, 16, 20\u201323.\n   In sum, the trial court\u2019s ruling, with its uncertain edges,\nmay have restricted observation evidence admissible on\nmens rea to the insanity defense alone, but we cannot be\nsure.34 But because a due process challenge to such a\nrestriction of observation evidence was, by our measure,\nneither pressed nor passed upon in the Arizona Court of\nAppeals, we do not consider it. See, e.g., Kentucky v. Stin\ncer, 482 U. S. 730, 747, n. 22 (1987); Illinois v. Gates, 462\nU. S. 213, 217\u2013224 (1983). What we do know, and now\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  34We therefore have no reason to believe that the courts of Arizona\n\nwould have failed to restrict their application of Mott to the professional\ntestimony the Mott opinion was stated to cover, if Clark\u2019s counsel had\nspecified any observation evidence he claimed to be generally admissi\nble and relevant to mens rea. Nothing that we hold here is authority\nfor restricting a factfinder\u2019s consideration of observation evidence\nindicating state of mind at the time of a criminal offense (conventional\nmens rea evidence) as distinct from professional mental-disease or\ncapacity evidence going to ability to form a certain state of mind during\na period that includes the time of the offense charged. And, of course,\nnothing held here prevents Clark from raising this discrete claim when\nthe case returns to the courts of Arizona, if consistent with the State\u2019s\nprocedural rules.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           25\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconsider, is Clark\u2019s claim that Mott denied due process\nbecause it \u201cpreclude[d] Eric from contending that . . .\nfactual inferences\u201d of the \u201cmental states which were neces\nsary elements of the crime charged\u201d \u201cshould not be drawn\nbecause the behavior was explainable, instead, as a mani\nfestation of his chronic paranoid schizophrenia.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner 13 (emphasis in original). We consider the\nclaim, as Clark otherwise puts it, that \u201cArizona\u2019s prohibi\ntion of \u2018diminished capacity\u2019 evidence by criminal defen\ndants violates\u201d due process, ibid.\n                            D\n  Clark\u2019s argument that the Mott rule violates the Four\nteenth Amendment guarantee of due process turns on the\napplication of the presumption of innocence in criminal\ncases, the presumption of sanity, and the principle that a\ncriminal defendant is entitled to present relevant and\nfavorable evidence on an element of the offense charged\nagainst him.\n                             1\n  The first presumption is that a defendant is innocent\nunless and until the government proves beyond a reason\nable doubt each element of the offense charged, see Patter\nson, 432 U. S., at 210\u2013211; In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358,\n361\u2013364 (1970), including the mental element or mens rea.\nBefore the last century, the mens rea required to be proven\nfor particular offenses was often described in general\nterms like \u201cmalice,\u201d see, e.g., In re Eckart, 166 U. S. 481\n(1897); 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *21 (\u201c[A]n unwar\nrantable act without a vicious will is no crime at all\u201d), but\nthe modern tendency has been toward more specific de\nscriptions, as shown in the Arizona statute defining the\nmurder charged against Clark: the State had to prove that\nin acting to kill the victim, Clark intended to kill a law\nenforcement officer on duty or knew that the victim was\n26                        CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsuch an officer on duty. See generally Gardner, The Mens\nRea Enigma: Observations on the Role of Motive in the\nCriminal Law Past and Present, 1993 Utah L. Rev. 635.\nAs applied to mens rea (and every other element), the force\nof the presumption of innocence is measured by the force\nof the showing needed to overcome it, which is proof be\nyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant\u2019s state of mind\nwas in fact what the charge states. See Winship, supra, at\n361\u2013363.\n                              2\n   The presumption of sanity is equally universal in some\nvariety or other, being (at least) a presumption that a\ndefendant has the capacity to form the mens rea necessary\nfor a verdict of guilt and the consequent criminal respon\nsibility. See Leland, 343 U. S., at 799; Davis v. United\nStates, 160 U. S. 469, 486\u2013487 (1895); M\u2019Naghten\u2019s Case, 10\nCl. & Fin., at 210, 8 Eng. Rep., at 722; see generally 1\nLaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a78.3(a), at 598\u2013599,\nand n. 1. This presumption dispenses with a requirement\non the government\u2019s part to include as an element of every\ncriminal charge an allegation that the defendant had such\na capacity.35 The force of this presumption, like the pre\nsumption of innocence, is measured by the quantum of\nevidence necessary to overcome it; unlike the presumption\nof innocence, however, the force of the presumption of\nsanity varies across the many state and federal jurisdic\ntions, and prior law has recognized considerable leeway on\nthe part of the legislative branch in defining the presump\ntion\u2019s strength through the kind of evidence and degree of\npersuasiveness necessary to overcome it, see Fisher v.\n\nUnited States, 328 U. S. 463, 466\u2013476 (1946).36\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n  35 A  legislature is nonetheless free to require affirmative proof of san\nity by the way it describes a criminal offense, see Dixon v.

First, a State may allow\na defendant to introduce (and a factfinder to consider)\nevidence of mental disease or incapacity for the bearing it\ncan have on the government\u2019s burden to show mens rea.\nSee, e.g., State v. Perez, 882 A. 2d 574, 584 (R. I. 2005).37\nIn such States the evidence showing incapacity to form the\nguilty state of mind, for example, qualifies the probative\nforce of other evidence, which considered alone indicates\nthat the defendant actually formed the guilty state of\nmind. If it is shown that a defendant with mental disease\nthinks all blond people are robots, he could not have in\ntended to kill a person when he shot a man with blond\nhair, even though he seemed to act like a man shooting\nanother man.38 In jurisdictions that allow mental-disease\nand capacity evidence to be considered on par with any\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nlent to a Sandstrom presumption. See Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S.\n510, 514\u2013524 (1979) (due process forbids use of presumption that relieves\nthe prosecution of burden of proving mental state by inference of intent\nfrom an act).\n   37 In fact, Oregon had this scheme in place when we decided Leland v.\n\nOregon, 343 U. S. 790, 794\u2013796 (1952). We do not, however, read any\npart of Leland to require as a matter of due process that evidence of\nincapacity be considered to rebut the mens rea element of a crime.\n   38We reject the State\u2019s argument that mens rea and insanity, as cur\n\nrently understood, are entirely distinguishable, so that mental-disease\nand capacity evidence relevant to insanity is simply irrelevant to mens\nrea. Not only does evidence accepted as showing insanity trump mens\nrea, but evidence of behavior close to the time of the act charged may\nindicate both the actual state of mind at that time and also an enduring\nincapacity to form the criminal state of mind necessary to the offense\ncharged. See Brief for American Psychiatric Association et al. as Amici\nCuriae 12\u201313; Arenella, The Diminished Capacity and Diminished\nResponsibility Defenses: Two Children of a Doomed Marriage, 77\nColum. L. Rev. 827, 834\u2013835 (1977); cf. Powell v. Texas, 392 U. S. 514,\n535\u2013536 (1968) (plurality opinion) (the \u201cdoctrines of actus reus, mens rea,\ninsanity, mistake, justification, and duress\u201d are a \u201ccollection of interlock\ning and overlapping concepts which the common law has utilized to assess\nthe moral accountability of an individual for his antisocial deeds\u201d).\n28                   CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nother relevant evidence when deciding whether the prose\ncution has proven mens rea beyond a reasonable doubt,\nthe evidence of mental disease or incapacity need only\nsupport what the factfinder regards as a reasonable doubt\nabout the capacity to form (or the actual formation of) the\nmens rea, in order to require acquittal of the charge.\nThus, in these States the strength of the presumption of\nsanity is no greater than the strength of the evidence of\nabnormal mental state that the factfinder thinks is\nenough to raise a reasonable doubt.\n   The second point where the force of the presumption of\nsanity may be tested is in the consideration of a defense of\ninsanity raised by a defendant.          Insanity rules like\nM\u2019Naghten and the variants discussed in Part II, supra,\nare attempts to define, or at least to indicate, the kinds of\nmental differences that overcome the presumption of\nsanity or capacity and therefore excuse a defendant from\ncustomary criminal responsibility, see Jones, 463 U. S., at\n373, n. 4 (Brennan, J., dissenting); D. Hermann, The Insan\nity Defense: Philosophical, Historical and Legal Perspec\ntives 4 (1983) (\u201cA central significance of the insanity de\nfense . . . is the separation of nonblameworthy from\nblameworthy offenders\u201d), even if the prosecution has\notherwise overcome the presumption of innocence by\nconvincing the factfinder of all the elements charged be\nyond a reasonable doubt. The burden that must be carried\nby a defendant who raises the insanity issue, again, de\nfines the strength of the sanity presumption. A State may\nprovide, for example, that whenever the defendant raises\na claim of insanity by some quantum of credible evidence,\nthe presumption disappears and the government must\nprove sanity to a specified degree of certainty (whether\nbeyond reasonable doubt or something less). See, e.g.,\nCommonwealth v. Keita, 429 Mass. 843, 846, 712 N. E. 2d\n65, 68 (1999).

Rev.\nStat. Ann. \u00a713\u2013502(C) (West 2001); Leland, 343 U. S., at\n798. In any case, the defendant\u2019s burden defines the\npresumption of sanity, whether that burden be to burst a\nbubble or to show something more.\n                             3\n  The third principle implicated by Clark\u2019s argument is a\ndefendant\u2019s right as a matter of simple due process to\npresent evidence favorable to himself on an element that\nmust be proven to convict him.39 As already noted, evi\ndence tending to show that a defendant suffers from men\ntal disease and lacks capacity to form mens rea is relevant\nto rebut evidence that he did in fact form the required\nmens rea at the time in question; this is the reason that\nClark claims a right to require the factfinder in this case\nto consider testimony about his mental illness and his\nincapacity directly, when weighing the persuasiveness of\nother evidence tending to show mens rea, which the prose\ncution has the burden to prove.\n  As Clark recognizes, however, the right to introduce\nrelevant evidence can be curtailed if there is a good reason\nfor doing that. \u201cWhile the Constitution . . . prohibits the\nexclusion of defense evidence under rules that serve no\nlegitimate purpose or that are disproportionate to the ends\nthat they are asserted to promote, well-established rules of\nevidence permit trial judges to exclude evidence if its\nprobative value is outweighed by certain other factors\nsuch as unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or poten\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  39 Clark\u2019s argument assumes that Arizona\u2019s rule is a rule of evidence,\n\nrather than a redefinition of mens rea, see Montana v.

State law says that evidence of\nmental disease and incapacity may be introduced and\nconsidered, and if sufficiently forceful to satisfy the defen\ndant\u2019s burden of proof under the insanity rule it will dis\nplace the presumption of sanity and excuse from criminal\nresponsibility. But mental-disease and capacity evidence\nmay be considered only for its bearing on the insanity\ndefense, and it will avail a defendant only if it is persua\nsive enough to satisfy the defendant\u2019s burden as defined\nby the terms of that defense. The mental-disease and\ncapacity evidence is thus being channeled or restricted to\none issue and given effect only if the defendant carries the\nburden to convince the factfinder of insanity; the evidence\nis not being excluded entirely, and the question is whether\nreasons for requiring it to be channeled and restricted are\ngood enough to satisfy the standard of fundamental fair\nness that due process requires. We think they are.\n                             E\n                             1\n  The first reason supporting the Mott rule is Arizona\u2019s\nauthority to define its presumption of sanity (or capacity\nor responsibility) by choosing an insanity definition, as\ndiscussed in Part II, supra, and by placing the burden of\npersuasion on defendants who claim incapacity as an\nexcuse from customary criminal responsibility. No one,\ncertainly not Clark here, denies that a State may place a\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

And Clark presses no objection to Arizona\u2019s\ndecision to require persuasion to a clear and convincing\ndegree before the presumption of sanity and normal re\nsponsibility is overcome. See Brief for Petitioner 18, n. 25.\n   But if a State is to have this authority in practice as\nwell as in theory, it must be able to deny a defendant the\nopportunity to displace the presumption of sanity more\neasily when addressing a different issue in the course of\nthe criminal trial. Yet, as we have explained, just such an\nopportunity would be available if expert testimony of\nmental disease and incapacity could be considered for\nwhatever a factfinder might think it was worth on the\nissue of mens rea.40 As we mentioned, the presumption of\nsanity would then be only as strong as the evidence a\nfactfinder would accept as enough to raise a reasonable\ndoubt about mens rea for the crime charged; once reason\nable doubt was found, acquittal would be required, and the\nstandards established for the defense of insanity would go\nby the boards.\n   Now, a State is of course free to accept such a possibility\nin its law. After all, it is free to define the insanity de\nfense by treating the presumption of sanity as a bursting\nbubble, whose disappearance shifts the burden to the\nprosecution to prove sanity whenever a defendant pre\nsents any credible evidence of mental disease or incapac\nity. In States with this kind of insanity rule, the legisla\nture may well be willing to allow such evidence to be\nconsidered on the mens rea element for whatever the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   40 Cf. post, at 3 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe psychiatrist\u2019s explana\n\ntion of Clark\u2019s condition was essential to understanding how he proc\nesses sensory data and therefore to deciding what information was in\nhis mind at the time of the shooting.

What counts for due process,\nhowever, is simply that a State that wishes to avoid a\nsecond avenue for exploring capacity, less stringent for a\ndefendant, has a good reason for confining the considera\ntion of evidence of mental disease and incapacity to the\ninsanity defense.\n   It is obvious that Arizona\u2019s Mott rule reflects such a\nchoice. The State Supreme Court pointed out that the\nState had declined to adopt a defense of diminished capac\nity (allowing a jury to decide when to excuse a defendant\nbecause of greater than normal difficulty in conforming to\nthe law).41 The court reasoned that the State\u2019s choice\nwould be undercut if evidence of incapacity could be con\nsidered for whatever a jury might think sufficient to raise\na reasonable doubt about mens rea, even if it did not show\ninsanity. 187 Ariz., at 541, 931 P. 2d, at 1051. In other\nwords, if a jury were free to decide how much evidence of\nmental disease and incapacity was enough to counter\nevidence of mens rea to the point of creating a reasonable\ndoubt, that would in functional terms be analogous to\nallowing jurors to decide upon some degree of diminished\ncapacity to obey the law, a degree set by them, that would\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   41 Though the term \u201cdiminished capacity\u201d has been given different\n\nmeanings, see, e.g., Morse, Undiminished Confusion in Diminished\nCapacity, 75 J.

See post, at 10\u201318 (opinion of\nKENNEDY, J.). An insanity rule gives a defendant already\nfound guilty the opportunity to excuse his conduct by\nshowing he was insane when he acted, that is, that he did\nnot have the mental capacity for conventional guilt and\ncriminal responsibility. But, as the dissent argues, if the\nsame evidence that affirmatively shows he was not guilty\nby reason of insanity (or \u201cguilty except insane\u201d under\nArizona law, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a713\u2013502(A) (West\n2001)) also shows it was at least doubtful that he could\nform mens rea, then he should not be found guilty in the\nfirst place; it thus violates due process when the State\nimpedes him from using mental-disease and capacity\nevidence directly to rebut the prosecution\u2019s evidence that\nhe did form mens rea.\n   Are there, then, characteristics of mental-disease and\ncapacity evidence giving rise to risks that may reasonably\nbe hedged by channeling the consideration of such evi\ndence to the insanity issue on which, in States like Ari\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   42 It is beyond question that Arizona may preclude such a defense, see\n\nFisher v.

See, e.g., American Psychiatric Associa\ntion, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor\nders xxxiii (4th ed. text rev. 2000) (hereinafter DSM\u2013IV\u2013\nTR) (\u201cDSM\u2013IV reflects a consensus about the classification\nand diagnosis of mental disorders derived at the time of its\ninitial publication.

Even when a category of mental\ndisease is broadly accepted and the assignment of a defen\ndant\u2019s behavior to that category is uncontroversial, the\nclassification may suggest something very significant\nabout a defendant\u2019s capacity, when in fact the classifica\ntion tells us little or nothing about the ability of the defen\ndant to form mens rea or to exercise the cognitive, moral,\nor volitional capacities that define legal sanity.43 See\nDSM\u2013IV\u2013TR xxxii\u2013xxxiii (\u201cWhen the DSM\u2013IV categories,\ncriteria, and textual descriptions are employed for forensic\npurposes, there are significant risks that diagnostic infor\nmation will be misused or misunderstood.

Evidence of\nmental disease, then, can easily mislead; it is very easy to\nslide from evidence that an individual with a profession\nally recognized mental disease is very different, into\ndoubting that he has the capacity to form mens rea,\nwhereas that doubt may not be justified. And of course, in\nthe cases mentioned before, in which the categorization is\ndoubtful or the category of mental disease is itself subject\nto controversy, the risks are even greater that opinions\nabout mental disease may confuse a jury into thinking the\nopinions show more than they do. Because allowing men\ntal-disease evidence on mens rea can thus easily mislead,\nit is not unreasonable to address that tendency by con-\nfining consideration of this kind of evidence to insanity,\non which a defendant may be assigned the burden of\npersuasion.\n   There are, finally, particular risks inherent in the opin\nions of the experts who supplement the mental-disease\nclassifications with opinions on incapacity: on whether the\nmental disease rendered a particular defendant incapable\nof the cognition necessary for moral judgment or mens rea\nor otherwise incapable of understanding the wrongfulness\nof the conduct charged. Unlike observational evidence\nbearing on mens rea, capacity evidence consists of judg\nment, and judgment fraught with multiple perils: a defen\ndant\u2019s state of mind at the crucial moment can be elusive\nno matter how conscientious the enquiry, and the law\u2019s\ncategories that set the terms of the capacity judgment are\nnot the categories of psychology that govern the expert\u2019s\nprofessional thinking. Although such capacity judgments\nmay be given in the utmost good faith, their potentially\ntenuous character is indicated by the candor of the defense\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

Contrary to the State\u2019s expert, he\ntestified that Clark lacked the capacity to appreciate the\ncircumstances realistically and to understand the wrong\nfulness of what he was doing, App. 48\u201349, but he said that\n\u201cno one knows exactly what was on [his] mind\u201d at the time\nof the shooting, id., at 48. And even when an expert is\nconfident that his understanding of the mind is reliable,\njudgment addressing the basic categories of capacity\nrequires a leap from the concepts of psychology, which are\ndevised for thinking about treatment, to the concepts of\nlegal sanity, which are devised for thinking about criminal\nresponsibility. See Insanity Defense Work Group, Ameri\ncan Psychiatric Association Statement on the Insanity\nDefense, 140 Am. J.

In sum, these empirical and\nconceptual problems add up to a real risk that an expert\u2019s\njudgment in giving capacity evidence will come with an\napparent authority that psychologists and psychiatrists do\nnot claim to have. We think that this risk, like the diffi\nculty in assessing the significance of mental-disease evi\ndence, supports the State\u2019s decision to channel such expert\ntestimony to consideration on the insanity defense, on\nwhich the party seeking the benefit of this evidence has\nthe burden of persuasion.\n   It bears repeating that not every State will find it\nworthwhile to make the judgment Arizona has made, and\nthe choices the States do make about dealing with the\nrisks posed by mental-disease and capacity evidence will\nreflect their varying assessments about the presumption\nof sanity as expressed in choices of insanity rules.44 The\npoint here simply is that Arizona has sensible reasons\nto assign the risks as it has done by channeling the\nevidence.45\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   44 A State in which the burden of persuasion as to a defendant\u2019s san\n\nity lies with the prosecution might also be justified in restricting\nmental-disease and capacity evidence to insanity determinations owing\nto the potential of mental-disease evidence to mislead and the risk of\nmisjudgment inherent in capacity evidence. We need not, in the\ncontext of this case, address that issue.\n   45 Arizona\u2019s rule is supported by a further practical reason, though\n\nnot as weighty as those just considered. As mentioned before, if sub\nstantial mental-disease and capacity evidence is accepted as rebutting\nmens rea in a given case, the affirmative defense of insanity will proba\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

But if a defendant succeeds in showing himself insane, Arizona\nlaw (and presumably that of every other State with an insanity rule)\nwill require commitment and treatment as a consequence of that\nfinding without more. It makes sense, then, to channel capacity evi\ndence to the issue structured to deal with mental incapacity when such\na claim is raised successfully. See, e.g., Jones, 463 U.

Ante, at 16\u201318.\n   I agree with the Court\u2019s basic categorization. I also\nagree that the Constitution permits a State to provide for\nconsideration of the second and third types of evidence\nsolely in conjunction with the insanity defense. A State\nmight reasonably fear that, without such a rule, the types\nof evidence as to intent would become confused in the\njury\u2019s mind, indeed that in some cases the insanity ques\ntion would displace the intent question as the parties\nlitigate both simultaneously.\n   Nonetheless, I believe the distinction among these\nkinds of evidence will be unclear in some cases.

I would also reserve the ques\ntion (as I believe the Court has done) as to the burden of\npersuasion in a case where the defendant produces suffi\ncient evidence of the second kind as to raise a reasonable\ndoubt suggesting that he suffered from a mental illness so\nsevere as to prevent him from forming any relevant intent\nat all.\n   For this reason, I dissent only from Parts III\u2013B and III\u2013\nC of the Court\u2019s opinion and the ultimate disposition of\nthis case, and I join the remainder.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

ARIZONA\n  ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF\n\n                ARIZONA, DIVISION ONE\n\n                        [June 29, 2006]\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS and\nJUSTICE GINSBURG join, dissenting.\n  In my submission the Court is incorrect in holding that\nArizona may convict petitioner Eric Clark of first-degree\nmurder for the intentional or knowing killing of a police\nofficer when Clark was not permitted to introduce critical\nand reliable evidence showing he did not have that intent\nor knowledge. The Court is wrong, too, when it concludes\nthe issue cannot be reached because of an error by Clark\u2019s\ncounsel. Its reasons and conclusions lead me to file this\nrespectful dissent.\n  Since I would reverse the judgment of the Arizona Court\nof Appeals on this ground, and the Arizona courts might\nwell alter their interpretation of the State\u2019s criminal re\nsponsibility statute were my rationale to prevail, it is\nunnecessary for me to address the argument that Ari\nzona\u2019s definition of insanity violates due process.\n                             I\n  Clark claims that the trial court erred in refusing to\nconsider evidence of his chronic paranoid schizophrenia in\ndeciding whether he possessed the knowledge or intent\nrequired for first-degree murder. Seizing upon a theory\ninvented here by the Court itself, the Court narrows\nClark\u2019s claim so he cannot raise the point everyone else\nthought was involved in the case. The Court says the only\n2                    CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nissue before us is whether there is a right to introduce\nmental-disease evidence or capacity evidence, not a right\nto introduce observation evidence. See ante, at 15\u201325.\nThis restructured evidentiary universe, with no convincing\nauthority to support it, is unworkable on its own terms.\nEven were that not so, however, the Court\u2019s tripartite\nstructure is something not addressed by the state trial\ncourt, the state appellate court, counsel on either side in\nthose proceedings, or the briefs the parties filed with us.\nThe Court refuses to consider the key part of Clark\u2019s claim\nbecause his counsel did not predict the Court\u2019s own inven\ntion. It is unrealistic, and most unfair, to hold that Clark\u2019s\ncounsel erred in failing to anticipate so novel an approach.\nIf the Court is to insist on its approach, at a minimum the\ncase should be remanded to determine whether Clark is\nbound by his counsel\u2019s purported waiver.\n   The Court\u2019s error, of course, has significance beyond this\ncase. It adopts an evidentiary framework that, in my\nview, will be unworkable in many cases. The Court classi\nfies Clark\u2019s behavior and expressed beliefs as observation\nevidence but insists that its description by experts must be\nmental-disease evidence or capacity evidence. See ante, at\n16\u201318. These categories break down quickly when it is\nunderstood how the testimony would apply to the question\nof intent and knowledge at issue here. The most common\ntype of schizophrenia, and the one Clark suffered from, is\nparanoid schizophrenia. See P. Berner et al., Diagnostic\nCriteria for Functional Psychoses 37 (2d ed. 1992). The\nexistence of this functional psychosis is beyond dispute,\nbut that does not mean the lay witness understands it or\nthat a disputed issue of fact concerning its effect in a\nparticular instance is not something for the expert to\naddress. Common symptoms of the condition are delu\nsions accompanied by hallucinations, often of the auditory\ntype, which can cause disturbances of perception. Ibid.\nClark\u2019s expert testified that people with schizophrenia\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\noften play radios loudly to drown out the voices in their\nheads. See App. 32. Clark\u2019s attorney argued to the trial\ncourt that this, rather than a desire to lure a policeman to\nthe scene, explained Clark\u2019s behavior just before the kill\ning. Id., at 294\u2013295. The observation that schizophrenics\nplay radios loudly is a fact regarding behavior, but it is\nonly a relevant fact if Clark has schizophrenia.\n   Even if this evidence were, to use the Court\u2019s term,\nmental-disease evidence, because it relies on an expert\nopinion, what would happen if the expert simply were to\ntestify, without mentioning schizophrenia, that people\nwith Clark\u2019s symptoms often play the radio loudly? This\nseems to be factual evidence, as the term is defined by the\nCourt, yet it differs from mental-disease evidence only in\nforcing the witness to pretend that no one has yet come up\nwith a way to classify the set of symptoms being described.\nMore generally, the opinion that Clark had paranoid\nschizophrenia\u2014an opinion shared by experts for both the\nprosecution and defense\u2014bears on efforts to determine, as\na factual matter, whether he knew he was killing a police\nofficer. The psychiatrist\u2019s explanation of Clark\u2019s condition\nwas essential to understanding how he processes sensory\ndata and therefore to deciding what information was in his\nmind at the time of the shooting. Simply put, knowledge\nrelies on cognition, and cognition can be affected by\nschizophrenia. See American Psychiatric Association,\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\n299 (4th ed. text rev. 2000) (\u201cThe characteristic symptoms\nof Schizophrenia involve a range of cognitive and emo\ntional dysfunctions that include perception\u201d); ibid. (Symp\ntoms include delusions, which are \u201cerroneous beliefs that\nusually involve a misinterpretation of perceptions or\nexperiences\u201d). The mental-disease evidence at trial was\nalso intertwined with the observation evidence because it\nlent needed credibility. Clark\u2019s parents and friends testi\nfied Clark thought the people in his town were aliens\n4                    CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ntrying to kill him. These claims might not be believable\nwithout a psychiatrist confirming the story based on his\nexperience with people who have exhibited similar behav\niors. It makes little sense to divorce the observation evi\ndence from the explanation that makes it comprehensible.\n   Assuming the Court\u2019s tripartite structure were feasible,\nthe Court is incorrect when it narrows Clark\u2019s claim to\nexclude any concern about observation evidence. In decid\ning Clark\u2019s counsel failed to raise this issue, the Court\nrelies on a series of perceived ambiguities regarding how\nthe claim fits within the Court\u2019s own categories. See ante,\nat 15\u201325. The Court cites no precedent for construing\nthese ambiguities against the claimant and no prudential\nreason for ignoring the breadth of Clark\u2019s claim. It is\nparticularly surprising that the Court does so to the det\nriment of a criminal defendant asserting the fundamental\nchallenge that the trier of fact refused to consider critical\nevidence showing he is innocent of the crime charged.\n   The alleged ambiguities are, in any event, illusory. The\nevidence at trial addressed more than the question of\ngeneral incapacity or opinions regarding mental illness; it\nwent further, as it included so-called observation evidence\nrelevant to Clark\u2019s mental state at the moment he shot the\nofficer. There was testimony, for example, that Clark\nthought the people in his town, particularly government\nofficials, were not human beings but aliens who were\ntrying to kill him. See App. 119\u2013121, 131\u2013132, 192\u2013197,\n249\u2013256; Tr. of Bench Trial in No. CR\u20132000\u2013538, pp. 110\u2013\n112, 131\u2013132, 136, 226\u2013228 (Aug. 20, 2003); id., at 24\u201325,\n59\u201360 (Aug. 21, 2003). The Court recognizes the existence\nof this essential observation evidence. See ante, at 16\u201317.\n   The Court holds, nonetheless, that \u201cwe cannot be sure\u201d\nwhether the trial court failed to consider this evidence.\nAnte, at 24. It is true the trial court ruling was not per\nfectly clear. Its language does strongly suggest, though,\nthat it did not consider any of this testimony in deciding\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            5\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nwhether Clark had the knowledge or intent required for\nfirst-degree murder. After recognizing that \u201cmuch of the\nevidence that [the defense is] going to be submitting, in\nfact all of it, as far as I know . . . that has to do with the\ninsanity could also arguably be made . . . as to form and\nintent and his capacity for the intent,\u201d the court concluded\n\u201cwe will be focusing, as far as I\u2019m concerned, strictly on\nthe insanity defense.\u201d App. 9. In announcing its verdict,\nthe trial court did not mention any of the mental-illness\nevidence, observation or otherwise, in deciding Clark\u2019s\nguilt. Id., at 331\u2013335. The most reasonable assumption,\nthen, would seem to be that the trial court did not consider\nit, and the Court does not hold otherwise. See ante, at 20.\n   Clark\u2019s objection to this refusal by the trier of fact to\nconsider the evidence as it bore on his key defense was\nmade at all stages of the proceeding. In his post-trial\nmotion to vacate the judgment, Clark argued that \u201cprohib\niting consideration of any evidence reflecting upon a men\ntally ill criminal defendant\u2019s ability to form the necessary\nmens rea violates due process.\u201d Record, Doc. 406, p. 8.\nClark pressed the same argument in the Arizona Court of\nAppeals. See Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief in No. 1CA\u2013CR\u2013\n03\u20130851 etc., pp. 46\u201352 (hereinafter Appellant\u2019s Opening\nBrief). He also noted that the trial judge had erred in\nrefusing to consider non-expert testimony\u2014presumably\nwhat the Court would call observation evidence\u2014on\nClark\u2019s mental illness. Id., at 47\u201348. (\u201cThe trial court\ntherefore violated [Clark\u2019s] right to present a defense\nbecause [the] court refused to consider any evidence, in\ncluding the multiple testimonials of lay witnesses . . . in\ndeciding whether he could form the requisite mens rea\u201d).\nThe appeals court decided the issue on the merits, holding\nthat the trial court was correct not to consider the evi\ndence of mental illness in determining whether Clark had\nthe mens rea for first-degree murder. See App. 351\u2013353.\nIt offered no distinction at all between observation or\n6                     CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nmental-disease evidence.\n    Notwithstanding the appeals court\u2019s decision, the Court\nstates that the issue was not clearly presented to the state\ncourts. See ante, at 21\u201324. According to the Court, Clark\nonly raised an objection based on State v. Mott, 187 Ariz.\n536, 931 P. 2d 1046 (1997) (en banc), see ante, at 21\u201324,\nand Mott\u2019s holding was limited to the exclusion of mental-\ndisease and capacity evidence, see ante, at 19. The Court\nis incorrect, and on both counts.\n    First, Clark\u2019s claim goes well beyond an objection to\nMott. In fact, he specifically attempted to distinguish Mott\nby noting that the trial court in this case refused to con\nsider all evidence of mental illness. See Record, Doc. 406,\nat 8; see also Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief 48. The Court\nnotices these arguments but criticizes Clark\u2019s counsel for\nnot being specific about the observation evidence he\nwanted the trial court to consider. See ante, at 22. There\nwas no reason, though, for Clark\u2019s counsel to believe addi\ntional specificity was required, since there was no evident\ndistinction in Arizona law between observation evidence\nand mental-disease testimony.\n    Second, Mott\u2019s holding was not restricted to mental-\ndisease evidence. The Arizona Supreme Court did not\nrefer to any distinction between observation and mental-\ndisease evidence, or lay and expert testimony. Its holding\nwas stated in broad terms: \u201cArizona does not allow evi\ndence of a defendant\u2019s mental disorder short of insanity\neither as an affirmative defense or to negate the mens rea\nelement of a crime.\u201d 187 Ariz., at 541, 931 P. 2d, at 1051;\nsee id., at 540, 931 P. 2d, at 1050 (\u201cThe legislature\u2019s decision\n. . . evidences its rejection of the use of psychological testi\nmony to challenge the mens rea element of a crime\u201d). The\nCourt attempts to divine a fact/opinion distinction in Mott\nbased on Mott\u2019s distinguishing a case, State v. Christensen,\n129 Ariz. 32, 628 P. 2d 580 (1981) (in banc), where evidence\nabout behavioral tendencies was deemed admissible. See\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nante, at 19. Christensen, though, also addressed an expert\nopinion; the difference was that the evidence there con\ncerned a \u201ccharacter trait of acting reflexively in response to\nstress,\u201d not a mental illness. Mott, supra, at 544, 931 P. 2d,\nat 1054. Since the Court recognizes the Arizona Court of\nAppeals relied on Mott, the expansive rule of exclusion in\nMott\u2014without any suggestion of a limitation depending on\nthe kind of evidence\u2014should suffice for us to reach the so-\ncalled observation-evidence issue. Even if, as the Court\ncontends, see ante, at 15, Mott is limited to expert testi\nmony, the Court\u2019s categories still do not properly interpret\nMott, because the Court\u2019s own definition of observation\nevidence includes some expert testimony, see ante, at 17.\n   It makes no difference that in the appeals court Clark\nreferred to the issue as inability to form knowledge or\nintent. See Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief 46\u201352. He did not\ninsist on some vague, general incapacity. He stated,\ninstead, that he \u201csuffered from a major mental illness and\nwas psychotic at the time of the offense.\u201d Id., at 48. Even\nif Clark\u2019s arguments were insufficient to apprise the state\ncourt of the argument, \u201c[o]ur traditional rule is that \u2018[o]nce\na federal claim is properly presented, a party can make\nany argument in support of that claim; parties are not\nlimited to the precise arguments they made below.\u2019 \u201d\nLebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513\nU. S. 374, 379 (1995) (quoting Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S.\n519, 534 (1992)). The claim is clear. Though it seems to be\nobscure to this Court, it was understood by the Arizona\nCourt of Appeals, which stated: \u201cClark argues that the trial\ncourt erred in refusing to consider evidence of his mental\ndisease or defect in determining whether he had the req\nuisite mens rea to commit first-degree murder.\u201d App. 351.\nWhen the question is what the state court held, it is not\ninstructive for this Court to recast the words the state\ncourt used.\n   The razor-thin distinction the Court draws between\n8                    CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nevidence being used to show incapacity and evidence being\nused to show lack of mens rea directly does not identify\ntwo different claims. Clark\u2019s single claim, however char\nacterized, involves the use of the same mental-illness\nevidence to decide whether he had the requisite knowledge\nor intent. The various ways in which the evidence is\nrelevant in disproving mens rea hardly qualify as separate\nclaims. The new arguments allowed in Lebron and Yee, by\ncomparison, were far more disconnected from the initial\nbases for the alleged violations. See Lebron, supra, at 378,\n379 (for purposes of showing state action, petitioner could\nargue that Amtrak was a Government entity even though\nhe argued below only that it was a private entity with\nclose connections to Government entities, because the\nclaim was simply \u201cthat Amtrak did not accord him the\nrights it was obliged to provide by the First Amendment\u201d);\nYee, supra, at 534, 535 (petitioners could argue that an\nordinance constituted a regulatory taking, even though they\narguably asserted in the Court of Appeals only a physical\ntaking, because the claim was simply \u201cthat the ordinance\neffects an unconstitutional taking\u201d). If we give this latitude\nto litigants in civil cases, surely we must do so here. Fur\nthermore, to the extent any ambiguity remains on whether\nthe claim was raised, the proper course is to remand. See\nBradshaw v. Richey, 546 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 6)\n(per curiam). Unless the state court clearly decides an\nissue on state-law grounds, which the Court does not\ncontend occurred here, there is no bar to our review of the\nfederal question. See Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255, 261\u2013\n262 (1989).\n   Before this Court Clark framed the issue in broad terms\nthat encompass the question whether the evidence of his\nmental illness should have been considered to show he did\nnot at the time of the offense have the knowledge or intent\nto shoot a police officer.

An entire section of Clark\u2019s\nopening brief argues that the evidence of mental illness\nshould have been considered to rebut the prosecution\u2019s\ninference of knowledge or intent from the factual circum\nstances of the crime. See Brief for Petitioner 13\u201321. This\nline of argument concerns facts of behavior and amounts\nto more than a claim of general incapacity.\n   Clark seeks resolution of issues that can be complex and\nsomewhat overlapping. In the end, however, we must\ndecide whether he had the right to introduce evidence\nshowing he lacked the intent or knowledge the statute\nitself sets forth in describing a basic element of the crime.\nClark has preserved this issue at all stages, including in\nthis Court.\n                            II\n  Clark was charged with first-degree murder for the shoot\n10                   CLARK v.

Rev.\nStat. Ann. \u00a713\u20131105(A)(3) (West Supp. 2005).

See App. 9; see also Mott, 187 Ariz., at 541, 931\nP. 2d, at 1051.\n   States have substantial latitude under the Constitution\nto define rules for the exclusion of evidence and to apply\nthose rules to criminal defendants.

If the trier\nof fact were to find Clark\u2019s evidence sufficient to discount\nthe case made by the State, which has the burden to prove\nknowledge or intent as an element of the offense, Clark\nwould not be guilty of first-degree murder under Arizona\nlaw.\n   The Court attempts to diminish Clark\u2019s interest by treat\ning mental-illness evidence as concerning only \u201cjudgment,\u201d\nrather than fact. Ante, at 36. This view appears to derive\nfrom the Court\u2019s characterization of Clark\u2019s claim as rais\ning only general incapacity. See ibid. This is wrong for\nthe reasons already discussed. It fails to recognize, more\nover, the meaning of the offense element in question here.\nThe mens rea element of intent or knowledge may, at some\nlevel, comprise certain moral choices, but it rests in the\nfirst instance on a factual determination. That is the fact\nClark sought to put in issue. Either Clark knew he was\nkilling a police officer or he did not.\n   The issue is not, as the Court insists, whether Clark\u2019s\nmental illness acts as an \u201cexcuse from customary criminal\nresponsibility,\u201d ante, at 30, but whether his mental illness,\nas a factual matter, made him unaware that he was shoot\ning a police officer. If it did, Clark needs no excuse, as\nthen he did not commit the crime as Arizona defines it.\nFor the elements of first-degree murder, where the ques\ntion is knowledge of particular facts\u2014that one is killing a\npolice officer\u2014the determination depends not on moral\nresponsibility but on empirical fact. Clark\u2019s evidence of\nmental illness had a direct and substantial bearing upon\nwhat he knew, or thought he knew, to be the facts when\nhe pulled the trigger; this lay at the heart of the matter.\n   The trial court\u2019s exclusion was all the more severe be\ncause it barred from consideration on the issue of mens rea\nall this evidence, from any source, thus preventing Clark\nfrom showing he did not commit the crime as defined by\n12                   CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nArizona law. Quite apart from due process principles, we\nhave held that a bar of this sort can be inconsistent with\nthe Confrontation Clause. See Delaware v. Van Arsdall,\n475 U. S. 673 (1986). In Van Arsdall the Court held a state\ncourt erred in making a ruling that \u201cprohibited all inquiry\ninto\u201d an event. Id., at 679. At issue was a line of defense\nquestioning designed to show the bias of a prosecution\nwitness. In the instant case the ruling in question bars from\nconsideration all testimony from all witnesses necessary to\npresent the argument that was central to the whole case for\nthe defense: a challenge to the State\u2019s own proof on an\nelement of the crime. The Due Process and Compulsory\nProcess Clauses, and not the Confrontation Clause, may be\nthe controlling standard; but the disability imposed on the\naccused is every bit as substantial and pervasive here as it\nwas in Van Arsdall.\n   Arizona\u2019s rule is problematic because it excludes evi\ndence no matter how credible and material it may be in\ndisproving an element of the offense. The Court\u2019s cases\nhave noted the potential arbitrariness of per se exclusions\nand, on this rationale, have invalidated various state\nprohibitions. See Holmes, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 9)\n(rule excluding, in certain cases, evidence that a third\nparty may have committed the crime \u201ceven if that evi\ndence, if viewed independently, would have great proba\ntive value and even if it would not pose an undue risk of\nharassment, prejudice, or confusion of the issues\u201d); Rock,\nsupra, at 56 (rule excluding all hypnotically refreshed\ntestimony \u201coperates to the detriment of any defendant who\nundergoes hypnosis, without regard to the reasons for it,\nthe circumstances under which it took place, or any inde\npendent verification of the information it produced\u201d);\nWashington v. Texas, 388 U. S. 14, 22 (1967) (rule excluding\naccomplice testimony \u201cprevent[s] whole categories of de\nfense witnesses from testifying on the basis of a priori\ncategories that presume them unworthy of belief\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           13\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n   This is not to suggest all general rules on the exclusion\nof certain types of evidence are invalid. If the rule does\nnot substantially burden the defense, then it is likely\npermissible. See Scheffer, 523 U. S., at 316\u2013317 (uphold\ning exclusion of polygraph evidence in part because this\nrule \u201cdoes not implicate any significant interest of the\naccused\u201d); id., at 318 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment) (\u201c[S]ome later case might present\na more compelling case for introduction of the testimony\nthan this one does\u201d). Where, however, the burden is sub\nstantial, the State must present a valid reason for its per\nse evidentiary rule.\n   In the instant case Arizona\u2019s proposed reasons are insuf\nficient to support its categorical exclusion. While the\nState contends that testimony regarding mental illness\nmay be too incredible or speculative for the jury to con\nsider, this does not explain why the exclusion applies in all\ncases to all evidence of mental illness. \u201cA State\u2019s legiti\nmate interest in barring unreliable evidence does not\nextend to per se exclusions that may be reliable in an\nindividual case.\u201d Rock, 483 U. S., at 61. States have\ncertain discretion to bar unreliable or speculative testi\nmony and to adopt rules to ensure the reliability of expert\ntestimony. Arizona has done so, and there is no reason to\nbelieve its rules are insufficient to avoid speculative evi\ndence of mental illness. See Ariz. Rules of Evid. 403, 702\n(West 2005). This is particularly true because Arizona\napplies its usual case-by-case approach to permit admis\nsion of evidence of mental illness for a variety of other\npurposes. See, e.g., State v. Lindsey, 149 Ariz. 472, 474\u2013\n475, 720 P. 2d 73, 74\u201375 (1986) (en banc) (psychological\ncharacteristics of molestation victims); State v. Hamilton,\n177 Ariz. 403, 408\u2013410, 868 P. 2d 986, 991\u2013993 (App.\n1993) (psychological evidence of child abuse accommoda\ntion syndrome); Horan v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, 167 Ariz. 322,\n325\u2013326, 806 P. 2d 911, 914\u2013915 (App. 1991) (psychiatric\n14                    CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ntestimony regarding neurological deficits).\n   The risk of jury confusion also fails to justify the rule.\nThe State defends its rule as a means to avoid the com\nplexities of determining how and to what degree a mental\nillness affects a person\u2019s mental state. The difficulty of\nresolving a factual issue, though, does not present a suffi\ncient reason to take evidence away from the jury even\nwhen it is crucial for the defense. \u201cWe have always\ntrusted juries to sort through complex facts in various\nareas of law.\u201d United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 289\n(2005) (STEVENS, J., dissenting in part). Even were the risk\nof jury confusion real enough to justify excluding evidence in\nmost cases, this would provide little basis for prohibiting all\nevidence of mental illness without any inquiry into its likely\neffect on the jury or its role in deciding the linchpin issue of\nknowledge and intent. Indeed, Arizona has a rule in place\nto serve this very purpose. See Ariz. Rule of Evid. 403.\n   Even assuming the reliability and jury-confusion justifi\ncations were persuasive in some cases, they would not\nsuffice here. It does not overcome the constitutional objec\ntion to say that an evidentiary rule that is reasonable on\nits face can be applied as well to bar significant defense\nevidence without any rational basis for doing so. In Van\nArsdall, for example, the Court rejected the application of\nDelaware Rule of Evidence 403, which allows relevant\nevidence to be excluded where its probative value is sub\nstantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice or other\nharms to the trial process. 475 U. S., at 676, and n. 2.\nWhile the Rule is well established and designed for a legiti\nmate function, the Constitution prevented an application\nthat deprived the defendant of all inquiry into an important\nissue. Id., at 679. Other cases have applied this same case-\nspecific analysis in deciding the legitimacy of an exclusion.\nSee, e.g., Rock, supra, at 62 (the \u201ccircumstances present an\nargument for admissibility of petitioner\u2019s testimony in this\nparticular case, an argument that must be considered by the\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           15\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ntrial court\u201d); Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U. S. 284, 302\n(1973) (\u201cIn these circumstances, where constitutional rights\ndirectly affecting the ascertainment of guilt are implicated,\nthe hearsay rule may not be applied mechanistically\nto defeat the ends of justice\u201d); cf. Scheffer, 523 U. S., at\n318 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment).\n   The Court undertakes little analysis of the interests\nparticular to this case. By proceeding in this way it de\nvalues Clark\u2019s constitutional rights. The reliability ra\ntionale has minimal applicability here. The Court is\ncorrect that many mental diseases are difficult to define\nand the subject of great debate. See ante, at 33\u201334.\nSchizophrenia, however, is a well-documented mental\nillness, and no one seriously disputes either its definition\nor its most prominent clinical manifestations. The State\u2019s\nown expert conceded that Clark had paranoid schizophre\nnia and was actively psychotic at the time of the killing.\nSee App. 254\u2013257. The jury-confusion rationale, if it is at\nall applicable here, is the result of the Court\u2019s own insis\ntence on conflating the insanity defense and the question\nof intent. Considered on its own terms, the issue of intent\nand knowledge is a straightforward factual question. A\ntrier of fact is quite capable of weighing defense testimony\nand then determining whether the accused did or did not\nintend to kill or knowingly kill a human being who was a\npolice officer. True, the issue can be difficult to decide in\nparticular instances, but no more so than many matters\njuries must confront.\n   The Court says mental-illness evidence \u201ccan easily\nmislead,\u201d ante, at 36, and may \u201ctel[l] us little or nothing\nabout the ability of the defendant to form mens rea,\u201d ante,\nat 35. These generalities do not, however, show how\nrelevant or misleading the evidence in this case would be\n(or explain why Arizona Rule of Evidence 403 is insuffi\ncient for weighing these factors). As explained above, the\n16                   CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nevidence of Clark\u2019s mental illness bears directly on mens\nrea, for it suggests Clark may not have known he was\nkilling a human being. It is striking that while the Court\ndiscusses at length the likelihood of misjudgment from\nplacing too much emphasis on evidence of mental illness,\nsee ante, at 33\u201338, it ignores the risk of misjudging an\ninnocent man guilty from refusing to consider this highly\nrelevant evidence at all. Clark\u2019s expert, it is true, said no\none could know exactly what was on Clark\u2019s mind at the\ntime of the shooting. See ante, at 37. The expert testified\nextensively, however, about the effect of Clark\u2019s delusions\non his perceptions of the world around him, and about\nwhether Clark\u2019s behavior around the time of the shooting\nwas consistent with delusional thinking. This testimony\nwas relevant to determining whether Clark knew he was\nkilling a human being. It also bolstered the testimony of\nlay witnesses, none of which was deemed unreliable or\nmisleading by the state courts.\n   For the same reasons, the Court errs in seeking support\nfrom the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s statement\nthat a psychiatrist may be justifiably reluctant to reach\nlegal conclusions regarding the defendant\u2019s mental state.\nSee ante, at 37. In this very case, the American Psychiat\nric Association made clear that psychiatric evidence plays\na crucial role regardless of whether the psychiatrist testi\nfies on the ultimate issue: \u201cExpert evidence of mental\ndisorders, presented by qualified professionals and subject\nto adversarial testing, is both relevant to the mental-state\nissues raised by mens rea requirements and reliable. . . .\nSuch evidence could not be condemned wholesale without\nunsettling the legal system\u2019s central reliance on such\nevidence.\u201d Brief for American Psychiatric Association\net al. as Amici Curiae 15.\n   Contrary to the Court\u2019s suggestion, see ante, at 35\u201336,\nthe fact that the state and defense experts drew different\nconclusions about the effect of Clark\u2019s mental illness on\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           17\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nhis mental state only made Clark\u2019s evidence contested; it\ndid not make the evidence irrelevant or misleading. The\ntrial court was capable of evaluating the competing con\nclusions, as factfinders do in countless cases where there\nis a dispute among witnesses. In fact, the potential to\nmislead will be far greater under the Court\u2019s new eviden\ntiary system, where jurors will receive observation evi\ndence without the necessary explanation from experts.\n   The fact that mental-illness evidence may be considered\nin deciding criminal responsibility does not compensate for\nits exclusion from consideration on the mens rea elements\nof the crime. Cf. ante, at 33. The evidence addresses\ndifferent issues in the two instances. Criminal responsi\nbility involves an inquiry into whether the defendant\nknew right from wrong, not whether he had the mens rea\nelements of the offense. While there may be overlap be\ntween the two issues, \u201cthe existence or nonexistence of\nlegal insanity bears no necessary relationship to the exis\ntence or nonexistence of the required mental elements of\nthe crime.\u201d Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 706 (1975)\n(Rehnquist, J., concurring).\n   Even if the analyses were equivalent, there is a different\nburden of proof for insanity than there is for mens rea.\nArizona requires the defendant to prove his insanity by\nclear and convincing evidence. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a713\u2013502(C) (West 2001). The prosecution, however, must\nprove all elements of the offense beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. See Mullaney, supra, at 703\u2013704; In re Winship,\n397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970). The shift in the burden on the\ncriminal responsibility issue, while permissible under our\nprecedent, see Leland v. Oregon, 343 U. S. 790 (1952),\ncannot be applied to the question of intent or knowledge\nwithout relieving the State of its responsibility to establish\nthis element of the offense. See Sandstrom v. Montana, 442\nU. S. 510, 524 (1979) (jury instruction that had the effect of\nplacing the burden on the defendant to disprove that he had\n18                    CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nthe requisite mental state violates due process). While\nevidentiary rules do not generally shift the burden\nimpermissibly, where there is a right to have evidence\nconsidered on an element of the offense, the right is not\nrespected by allowing the evidence to come in only on an\nissue for which the defendant bears the burden of proof.\nSee Cool v. United States, 409 U. S. 100, 103 (1972) (per\ncuriam) (jury instruction that allowed jury to consider\naccomplice\u2019s testimony only if it was true beyond a rea\nsonable doubt \u201cplaces an improper burden on the defense\nand allows the jury to convict despite its failure to find\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d); Martin v. Ohio, 480\nU. S. 228, 233\u2013234 (1987) (State can shift the burden on a\nclaim of self-defense, but if the jury were disallowed from\nconsidering self-defense evidence for purposes of deciding\nthe elements of the offense, it \u201cwould relieve the State of its\nburden and plainly run afoul of Winship\u2019s mandate\u201d). By\nviewing the Arizona rule as creating merely a \u201cpresump\ntion of sanity (or capacity or responsibility),\u201d ante, at 30,\nrather than a presumption that the mens rea elements\nwere not affected by mental illness, the Court fails to\nappreciate the implications for Winship.\n   The State attempts to sidestep the evidentiary issue\nentirely by claiming that its mental-illness exclusion\nsimply alters one element of the crime. The evidentiary\nrule at issue here, however, cannot be considered a valid\nredefinition of the offense. Under the State\u2019s logic, a\nperson would be guilty of first-degree murder if he know\ningly or intentionally killed a police officer or committed\nthe killing under circumstances that would show knowl\nedge or intent but for the defendant\u2019s mental illness. To\nbegin with, Arizona law does not say this. And if it did, it\nwould be impermissible. States have substantial discretion\nin defining criminal offenses. In some instances they may\nprovide that the accused has the burden of persuasion\nwith respect to affirmative defenses. See Patterson v. New\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          19\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nYork, 432 U. S. 197, 210 (1977). \u201cBut there are obviously\nconstitutional limits beyond which the States may not go\nin this regard.\u201d Ibid. If it were otherwise, States could\nlabel all evidentiary exclusions as redefinitions and so\nevade constitutional requirements. There is no rational\nbasis, furthermore, for criminally punishing a person who\ncommits a killing without knowledge or intent only if that\nperson has a mental illness. Cf. Robinson v. California,\n370 U. S. 660, 666 (1962). The State attempts to bring the\ninstant case within the ambit of Montana v. Egelhoff, 518\nU. S. 37 (1996); but in Egelhoff the excluded evidence con\ncerned voluntary intoxication, for which a person can be\nheld responsible. Viewed either as an evidentiary rule or a\nredefinition of the offense, it was upheld because it \u201ccom\nports with and implements society\u2019s moral perception that\none who has voluntarily impaired his own faculties should\nbe responsible for the consequences.\u201d Id., at 50 (plurality\nopinion). An involuntary mental illness does not implicate\nthis justification.\n   Future dangerousness is not, as the Court appears to\nconclude, see ante, at 38\u201339, n. 45, a rational basis for\nconvicting mentally ill individuals of crimes they did not\ncommit. Civil commitment proceedings can ensure that\nindividuals who present a danger to themselves or others\nreceive proper treatment without unfairly treating them\nas criminals. The State presents no evidence to the con\ntrary, and the Court ought not to imply otherwise.\n   The State gains little support from Fisher v. United\nStates, 328 U. S. 463 (1946). There the defendant re\nquested an instruction from the trial court that the jury\nconsider his mental deficiencies in determining his capac\nity for premeditation and deliberation. Id., at 470. The\nCourt noted that \u201c[i]n view of the status of the defense of\npartial responsibility in the District and the nation no\ncontention is or could be made of the denial of due proc\ness.\u201d Id., at 466. This dictum may be attributable to the\n20                    CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nfact that the cases recognizing a defendant\u2019s evidentiary\nrights and the prosecution\u2019s duty to prove all elements\nbeyond a reasonable doubt were still decades away. It\nmay also reflect the fact that the jury instructions as given\ndid seem to allow the jury to consider evidence of mental\ndeficiency if it disproved the elements of the offense. See\nid., at 467, n. 3 (The jury instructions stated, \u201c \u2018It is further\ncontended that even if sane and responsible, there was no\ndeliberate intent to kill, nor in fact any actual intent to\nkill. Therefore if not guilty by reason of insanity, the\ndefendant at most is guilty only of second degree murder\nor manslaughter\u2019 \u201d). Even further ambiguity comes from\nthe fact that the defense in Fisher concerned a claim that\nthe petitioner was \u201cmentally somewhat below the average\u201d\nwith a \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d of aggression. Id., at\n467. This general claim of mental deficiencies was rele\nvant to the \u201ctheory of partial responsibility,\u201d id., at 470, he\nwanted the jury to consider. Unlike the mental illness\nhere, though, which concerns inadequacy of perception\nand information processing, the petitioner\u2019s claim may not\nhave been relevant to mens rea unless mens rea were\nredefined to include an element of responsibility. Fisher\u2019s\nlanguage, then, does not control this case.\n   While Arizona\u2019s rule is not unique, either historically or\nin contemporary practice, this fact does not dispose of\nClark\u2019s constitutional argument. To the extent Fisher\nmay have suggested the contrary, subsequent cases make\nclear that while the existence of the rule in some jurisdic\ntions is a significant factor to consider, see Egelhoff, supra,\nat 43 (plurality opinion), it is not dispositive for evaluation\nof a claim that the accused was foreclosed from introduc\ning evidence crucial to the defense. The evidentiary exclu\nsion of accomplice testimony the Court invalidated in\nWashington was, in fact, well established. See 388 U. S.,\nat 21\u201322. The exclusion of hypnotically refreshed testi\nmony likewise had some support when the Court held it\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           21\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nunconstitutional as applied to a defendant\u2019s own testi\nmony. Rock, 483 U. S., at 57. While 13 States still impose\nsignificant restrictions on the use of mental-illness evi\ndence to negate mens rea, a substantial majority of the\nStates currently allow it. Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 22\u201323, and n. 13. The fact that a reason\nable number of States restrict this evidence weighs into\nthe analysis, but applying the rule as a per se bar, as\nArizona does, is so plainly unreasonable that it cannot be\nsustained.\n   Putting aside the lack of any legitimate state interest\nfor application of the rule in this case, its irrationality is\napparent when considering the evidence that is allowed.\nSee Washington, supra, at 22 (\u201cThe absurdity of the rule is\namply demonstrated by the exceptions that have been\nmade to it\u201d). Arizona permits the defendant to introduce,\nfor example, evidence of \u201cbehavioral tendencies\u201d to show\nhe did not have the required mental state. See Mott, 187\nAriz., at 544, 931 P. 2d, at 1054; Christensen, 129 Ariz., at\n35\u201336, 628 P. 2d, at 583\u2013584. While defining mental\nillness is a difficult matter, the State seems to exclude the\nevidence one would think most reliable by allowing unex\nplained and uncategorized tendencies to be introduced\nwhile excluding relatively well-understood psychiatric\ntestimony regarding well-documented mental illnesses. It\nis unclear, moreover, what would have happened in this\ncase had the defendant wanted to testify that he thought\nOfficer Moritz was an alien. If disallowed, it would be\ntantamount to barring Clark from testifying on his behalf\nto explain his own actions. If allowed, then Arizona\u2019s rule\nwould simply prohibit the corroboration necessary to make\nsense of Clark\u2019s explanation. In sum, the rule forces the\njury to decide guilt in a fictional world with undefined and\nunexplained behaviors but without mental illness. This\nrule has no rational justification and imposes a significant\nburden upon a straightforward defense: He did not commit\n22                  CLARK v.

Argued April 19, 2006\u2014Decided June 29, 2006\nPetitioner Clark was charged with first-degree murder under an Ari\n  zona statute prohibiting \u201c[i]nten[tionally] or knowing[ly]\u201d killing a\n  police officer in the line of duty. At his bench trial, Clark did not con\n  test that he shot the officer or that the officer died, but relied on his\n  own undisputed paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the incident to\n  deny that he had the specific intent to shoot an officer or knowledge\n  that he was doing so. Accordingly, the prosecutor offered circumstan\n  tial evidence that Clark knew the victim was a police officer and tes\n  timony indicating that Clark had previously stated he wanted to\n  shoot police and had lured the victim to the scene to kill him. In pre\n  senting the defense case, Clark claimed mental illness, which he\n  sought to introduce for two purposes. First, he raised the affirmative\n  defense of insanity, putting the burden on himself to prove by clear\n  and convincing evidence that, in the words of another state statute,\n  \u201cat the time of the [crime, he] was afflicted with a mental disease or\n  defect of such severity that [he] did not know the criminal act was\n  wrong.\u201d Second, he aimed to rebut the prosecution\u2019s evidence of the\n  requisite mens rea, that he had acted intentionally or knowingly to\n  kill an officer.\n     Ruling that Clark could not rely on evidence bearing on insanity to\n  dispute the mens rea, the trial court cited the Arizona Supreme\n  Court\u2019s decision in State v. Mott, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1169823\"><a href=\"/opinion/1169823/state-v-mott/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 931 P. 2d 1046, which\n  refused to allow psychiatric testimony to negate specific intent and\n  held that Arizona does not allow evidence of a mental disorder short\n  of insanity to negate the mens rea element of a crime. As to his in\n  sanity, then, Clark presented lay testimony describing his increas\n  ingly bizarre behavior over the year before the shooting. Other lay\n  and expert testimony indicated, among other things, that Clark\n  thought that \u201caliens\u201d (some impersonating government agents) were\n2                           CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    trying to kill him and that bullets were the only way to stop them. A\n    psychiatrist testified that Clark was suffering from paranoid schizo\n    phrenia with delusions about \u201caliens\u201d when he killed the officer, and\n    concluded that Clark was incapable of luring the officer or under\n    standing right from wrong and was thus insane at the time of the\n    killing. In rebuttal, the State\u2019s psychiatrist gave his opinion that\n    Clark\u2019s paranoid schizophrenia did not keep him from appreciating\n    the wrongfulness of his conduct before and after the shooting. The\n    judge then issued a first-degree murder verdict, finding that in light\n    of that the facts of the crime, the expert evaluations, Clark\u2019s actions\n    and behavior both before and after the shooting, and the observations\n    of those who knew him, Clark had not established that his schizo\n    phrenia distorted his perception of reality so severely that he did not\n    know his actions were wrong.\n       Clark moved to vacate the judgment and life sentence, arguing,\n    among other things, that Arizona\u2019s insanity test and its Mott rule\n    each violate due process. He claimed that the Arizona Legislature\n    had impermissibly narrowed its insanity standard in 1993 when it\n    eliminated the first of the two parts of the traditional M\u2019Naghten in\n    sanity test. The trial court denied the motion. Affirming, the Ari\n    zona Court of Appeals held, among other things, that the State\u2019s in\n    sanity scheme was consistent with due process. The court read Mott\n    as barring the trial court\u2019s consideration of evidence of Clark\u2019s mental\n    illness and capacity directly on the element of mens rea.\nHeld:\n    1. Due process does not prohibit Arizona\u2019s use of an insanity test\n stated solely in terms of the capacity to tell whether an act charged\n as a crime was right or wrong. Pp. 6\u201315.\n       (a) The first part of the landmark English rule in M\u2019Naghten\u2019s\n Case asks about cognitive capacity: whether a mental defect leaves a\n defendant unable to understand what he was doing. The second part\n presents an ostensibly alternative basis for recognizing a defense of\n insanity understood as a lack of moral capacity: whether a mental\n disease or defect leaves a defendant unable to understand that his\n action was wrong. Although the Arizona Legislature at first adopted\n the full M\u2019Naghten statement, it later dropped the cognitive incapac\n ity part. Under current Arizona law, a defendant will not be ad\n judged insane unless he demonstrates that at the time of the crime,\n he was afflicted with a mental disease or defect of such severity that\n he did not know the criminal act was wrong. Pp. 6\u20137.\n       (b) Clark insists that the side-by-side M\u2019Naghten test represents\n the minimum that a government must provide, and he argues that\n eliminating the first part \u201c \u2018offends [a] principle of justice so rooted in\n the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as funda\n                   Cite as: 548 U.

The claim entails\nno light burden, and Clark does not carry it. History shows no defer\nence to M\u2019Naghten that could elevate its formula to the level of fun\ndamental principle, so as to limit the traditional recognition of a\nState\u2019s capacity to define crimes and defenses. See, e.g., Patterson,\nsupra, at 210. Even a cursory examination of the traditional Anglo-\nAmerican approaches to insanity reveals significant differences a\nmong them, with four traditional strains variously combined to yield\na diversity of American standards. Although 17 States and the Fed\neral Government have adopted recognizable versions of the\nM\u2019Naghten test with both its components, other States have adopted\na variety of standards based on all or part of one or more of four vari\nants. The alternatives are multiplied further by variations in the\nprescribed insanity verdict. This varied background makes clear that\nno particular formulation has evolved into a baseline for due process,\nand that the insanity rule, like the conceptualization of criminal of\nfenses, is substantially open to state choice. Pp. 7\u201312.\n     (c) Nor does Arizona\u2019s abbreviation of the M\u2019Naghten statement\nraise a proper claim that some constitutional minimum has been\nshortchanged. Although Arizona\u2019s former statement of the full\nM\u2019Naghten rule was constitutionally adequate, the abbreviated rule\nis no less so, for cognitive incapacity is relevant under that state\nment, just as it was under the more extended formulation, and evi\ndence going to cognitive incapacity has the same significance under\nthe short form as it had under the long. Though Clark is correct that\napplying the moral incapacity test (telling right from wrong) does not\nnecessarily require evaluation of a defendant\u2019s cognitive capacity to\nappreciate the nature and quality of the acts charged against him,\nhis argument fails to recognize that cognitive incapacity is itself\nenough to demonstrate moral incapacity, so that evidence bearing on\nwhether the defendant knew the nature and quality of his actions is\nboth relevant and admissible. In practical terms, if a defendant did\nnot know what he was doing when he acted, he could not have known\nthat he was performing the wrongful act charged as a crime. The\nArizona appeals court acknowledged as much in this case. Clark\nadopted this very analysis in the trial court, which apparently agreed\nwhen it admitted his cognitive incapacity evidence for consideration\nunder the State\u2019s moral incapacity formulation. Clark can point to no\nevidence bearing on insanity that was excluded. Pp. 12\u201315.\n  2. The Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s Mott rule does not violate due\nprocess. Pp. 15\u201338.\n     (a) Mott held that testimony of a professional psychologist or psy\nchiatrist about a defendant\u2019s mental incapacity owing to mental dis\nease or defect was admissible, and could be considered, only for its\n4                           CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    bearing on an insanity defense, but could not be considered on the\n    element of mens rea. Of the three categories of evidence that poten\n    tially bear on mens rea\u2014(1) everyday \u201cobservation evidence\u201d either\n    by lay or expert witnesses of what Clark did or said, which may sup\n    port the professional diagnoses of disease and in any event is the\n    kind of evidence that can be relevant to show what was on Clark\u2019s\n    mind when he fired his gun; (2) \u201cmental-disease evidence,\u201d typically\n    from professional psychologists or psychiatrists based on factual re\n    ports, professional observations, and tests about Clark\u2019s mental dis\n    ease, with features described by the witness; and (3) \u201ccapacity evi\n    dence,\u201d typically by the same experts, about Clark\u2019s capacity for\n    cognition and moral judgment (and ultimately also his capacity to\n    form mens rea)\u2014Mott imposed no restriction on considering evidence\n    of the first sort, but applies to the latter two. Although the trial court\n    seems to have applied the Mott restriction to all three categories of\n    evidence Clark offered for the purpose of showing what he called his\n    inability to form the required mens rea, his objection to Mott\u2019s appli\n    cation does not turn on the distinction between lay and expert wit\n    nesses or the kinds of testimony they were competent to present.\n    Rather, the issue here is Clark\u2019s claim that the Mott rule violates due\n    process. Pp. 15\u201325.\n         (b) Clark\u2019s Mott challenge turns on the application of the pre\n    sumption of innocence in criminal cases, the presumption of sanity,\n    and the principle that a criminal defendant is entitled to present\n    relevant and favorable evidence on an element of the offense charged\n    against him. Pp. 25\u201330.\n           (i) The presumption of innocence is that a defendant is inno\n    cent unless and until the government proves beyond a reasonable\n    doubt each element of the offense changed, including the mental ele\n    ment or mens rea. The modern tendency is to describe the mens rea\n    required to prove particular offenses in specific terms, as shown in\n    the Arizona statute requiring the State to prove that in acting to kill\n    the victim, Clark intended to kill a law enforcement officer on duty or\n    knew that the victim was such an officer on duty. As applied to mens\n    rea (and every other element), the force of the presumption of inno\n    cence is measured by the force of the showing needed to overcome it,\n    which is proof beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant\u2019s state of\n    mind was in fact what the charge states. See In re Winship, 397\n    U. S. 358, 361\u2013363. Pp. 25\u201326.\n           (ii) The presumption of sanity dispenses with a requirement\n    that the government include as an element of every criminal charge\n    an allegation that the defendant had the capacity to form the mens\n    rea necessary for conviction and criminal responsibility. Unlike the\n    presumption of innocence, the presumption of sanity\u2019s force varies\n                    Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                      5\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nacross the many state and federal jurisdictions, and prior law has\nrecognized considerable leeway on the part of the legislative branch\nin defining the presumption\u2019s strength through the kind of evidence\nand degree of persuasiveness necessary to overcome it, see Fisher v.\nUnited States, 328 U. S. 463, 466\u2013476. There are two points where the\nsanity or capacity presumption may be placed in issue. First, a State\nmay allow a defendant to introduce (and a factfinder to consider) evi\ndence of mental disease or incapacity for the bearing it can have on\nthe government\u2019s burden to show mens rea. Second, the sanity pre\nsumption\u2019s force may be tested in the consideration of an insanity de\nfense raised by a defendant. Insanity rules like M\u2019Naghten and the\nvariants noted above are attempts to define or indicate the kinds of\nmental differences that overcome the presumption of sanity or capac\nity and therefore excuse a defendant from customary criminal re\nsponsibility, see, e.g., Jones v. United States, 463 U. S. 354, 373, n. 4,\neven if the prosecution has otherwise overcome the presumption of\ninnocence by convincing the factfinder of all the elements charged be\nyond a reasonable doubt. The burden a defendant raising the insan\nity issue must carry defines the strength of the sanity presumption.\nA State may, for example, place the burden of persuasion on a defen\ndant to prove insanity as the applicable law defines it, whether by a\npreponderance of the evidence or to some more convincing degree.\nSee, e.g., Leland v. Oregon, 343 U. S. 790, 798. Pp. 26\u201329.\n       (iii) A defendant has a due process right to present evidence\nfavorable to himself on an element that must be proven to convict\nhim. Evidence tending to show that a defendant suffers from mental\ndisease and lacks capacity to form mens rea is relevant to rebut evi\ndence that he did in fact form the required mens rea at the time in\nquestion. Thus, Clark claims a right to require the factfinder in this\ncase to consider testimony about his mental illness and his incapacity\ndirectly, when weighing the persuasiveness of other evidence tending\nto show mens rea, which the prosecution has the burden to prove.\nHowever, the right to introduce relevant evidence can be curtailed if\nthere is a good reason for doing so. For example, trial judges may\n\u201cexclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by certain other\nfactors such as unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or potential\nto mislead the jury.\u201d Holmes v. South Carolina, 547 U. S. ___, ___.\nAnd if evidence may be kept out entirely, its consideration may be\nsubject to limitation, which Arizona claims the power to impose here.\nUnder state law, mental-disease and capacity evidence may be con\nsidered only for its bearing on the insanity defense, and it will avail a\ndefendant only if it is persuasive enough to satisfy the defendant\u2019s\nburden as defined by the terms of that defense. Such evidence is thus\nbeing channeled or restricted to one issue; it is not being excluded en\n6                            CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    tirely, and the question is whether reasons for requiring it to be\n    channeled and restricted satisfy due process\u2019s fundamental fairness\n    standard. Pp. 29\u201330.\n          (c) The reasons supporting the Arizona rule satisfy due process.\n    Pp. 30\u201338.\n             (i) The first such reason is Arizona\u2019s authority to define its pre\n    sumption of sanity (or capacity or responsibility) by choosing an in\n    sanity definition and placing the burden of persuasion on criminal\n    defendants claiming incapacity as an excuse. Consistent with due\n    process, a State can require defendants to bear that burden, see\n    Leland, supra, at 797\u2013799, and Clark does not object to Arizona\u2019s deci\n    sion to require persuasion to a clear and convincing degree before the\n    presumption of sanity and normal responsibility is overcome. If a\n    State is to have this authority in practice as well as in theory, it must\n    be able to deny a defendant the opportunity to displace the sanity\n    presumption more easily when addressing a different issue during\n    the criminal trial. Yet just such an opportunity would be available if\n    expert testimony of mental disease and incapacity could be consid\n    ered for whatever a factfinder might think it was worth on the mens\n    rea issue. The sanity presumption would then be only as strong as\n    the evidence a factfinder would accept as enough to raise a reason\n    able doubt about mens rea; once reasonable doubt was found, acquit\n    tal would be required, and the standards established for the insanity\n    defense would go by the boards. What counts for due process is sim\n    ply that a State wishing to avoid a second avenue for exploring capac\n    ity, less stringent for a defendant, has a good reason for confining the\n    consideration of mental disease and incapacity evidence to the insan\n    ity defense. Pp. 30\u201332.\n             (ii) Arizona\u2019s rule also serves to avoid confusion and misunder\n    standing on the part of jurors. The controversial character of some\n    categories of mental disease, the potential of mental-disease evidence\n    to mislead, and the danger of according greater certainty to capacity\n    evidence than experts claim for it give rise to risks that may rea\n    sonably be hedged by channeling the consideration of such evidence\n    to the insanity issue on which, in States like Arizona, a defendant\n    has the burden of persuasion. First, the diagnosis may mask vigor\n    ous debate within the psychiatric profession about the very contours\n    of the mental disease itself. See, e.g., Jones, supra, at 364\u2013365, n. 13.\n    Though mental-disease evidence is certainly not condemned wholesale,\n    the consequence of this professional ferment is a general caution in\n    treating psychological classifications as predicates for excusing other\n    wise criminal conduct. Next, there is the potential of mental-disease\n    evidence to mislead jurors (when they are the factfinders) through\n    the power of this kind of evidence to suggest that a defendant suffer\n                      Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                      7\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  ing from a recognized mental disease lacks cognitive, moral, voli\n  tional, or other capacity, when that may not be a sound conclusion at\n  all. Even when a category of mental disease is broadly accepted and\n  the assignment of a defendant\u2019s behavior to that category is uncon\n  troversial, the classification may suggest something very significant\n  about a defendant\u2019s capacity, when in fact the classification tells little\n  or nothing about the defendant\u2019s ability to form mens rea or to exer\n  cise the cognitive, moral, or volitional capacities that define legal san\n  ity. The limits of the utility of a professional disease diagnosis are\n  evident in the dispute between the two testifying experts in this case;\n  they agree that Clark was schizophrenic, but they reach opposite con\n  clusions on whether his mental disease left him bereft of cognitive or\n  moral capacity. Finally, there are particular risks inherent in the\n  opinions of the experts who supplement the mental-disease classifica\n  tions with opinions on incapacity: on whether the mental disease\n  rendered a particular defendant incapable of the cognition necessary\n  for moral judgment or mens rea or otherwise incapable of under\n  standing the wrongfulness of the conduct charged. Unlike observa\n  tional evidence bearing on mens rea, capacity evidence consists of\n  judgment, and judgment is fraught with multiple perils. Although\n  such capacity judgments may be given in the utmost good faith, their\n  potentially tenuous character is indicated by the candor of the de\n  fense expert in this very case. He testified that Clark lacked the ca\n  pacity to appreciate the circumstances realistically and to under\n  stand the wrongfulness of what he was doing, but he admitted that\n  no one knew exactly what was on Clark\u2019s mind at the time of the\n  shooting. Even when an expert is confident that his understanding of\n  the mind is reliable, judgment addressing the basic categories of ca\n  pacity requires a leap from the concepts of psychology, which are de\n  vised for thinking about treatment, to the concepts of legal sanity,\n  which are devised for thinking about criminal responsibility. Pp. 33\u2013\n  38.\n       (d) For these reasons, there is also no cause to claim that chan\n  neling evidence on mental disease and capacity offends any \u201c \u2018princi\n  ple of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people\n  as to be ranked as fundamental,\u2019 \u201d Patterson, supra, at 202.

When he located the\ntruck, the officer turned on the emergency lights and siren\nof his marked patrol car, which prompted petitioner Eric\nClark, the truck\u2019s driver (then 17), to pull over. Officer\nMoritz got out of the patrol car and told Clark to stay\nwhere he was. Less than a minute later, Clark shot the\n2                        CLARK v.

Clark ran away on foot but was ar\nrested later that day with gunpowder residue on his\nhands; the gun that killed the officer was found nearby,\nstuffed into a knit cap.\n   Clark was charged with first-degree murder under Ariz.\nRev. Stat. Ann. \u00a713\u20131105(A)(3) (West Supp. 2005) for\nintentionally or knowingly killing a law enforcement\nofficer in the line of duty.1 In March 2001, Clark was\nfound incompetent to stand trial and was committed to a\nstate hospital for treatment, but two years later the same\ntrial court found his competence restored and ordered him\nto be tried. Clark waived his right to a jury, and the case\nwas heard by the court.\n   At trial, Clark did not contest the shooting and death,\nbut relied on his undisputed paranoid schizophrenia at the\ntime of the incident in denying that he had the specific\nintent to shoot a law enforcement officer or knowledge\nthat he was doing so, as required by the statute. Accord\ningly, the prosecutor offered circumstantial evidence that\nClark knew Officer Moritz was a law enforcement officer.\nThe evidence showed that the officer was in uniform at the\ntime, that he caught up with Clark in a marked police car\nwith emergency lights and siren going, and that Clark\nacknowledged the symbols of police authority and stopped.\nThe testimony for the prosecution indicated that Clark\nhad intentionally lured an officer to the scene to kill him,\nhaving told some people a few weeks before the incident\nthat he wanted to shoot police officers.

Witnesses testified, for example, that paranoid\ndelusions led Clark to rig a fishing line with beads and\nwind chimes at home to alert him to intrusion by invaders,\nand to keep a bird in his automobile to warn of airborne\npoison. There was lay and expert testimony that Clark\nthought Flagstaff was populated with \u201caliens\u201d (some im\npersonating government agents), the \u201caliens\u201d were trying\nto kill him, and bullets were the only way to stop them. A\npsychiatrist testified that Clark was suffering from para\nnoid schizophrenia with delusions about \u201caliens\u201d when he\nkilled Officer Moritz, and he concluded that Clark was\nincapable of luring the officer or understanding right from\nwrong and that he was thus insane at the time of the\nkilling. In rebuttal, a psychiatrist for the State gave his\nopinion that Clark\u2019s paranoid schizophrenia did not keep\nhim from appreciating the wrongfulness of his conduct, as\nshown by his actions before and after the shooting (such as\ncircling the residential block with music blaring as if to\nlure the police to intervene, evading the police after the\nshooting, and hiding the gun).\n   At the close of the defense case consisting of this evi\ndence bearing on mental illness, the trial court denied\nClark\u2019s renewed motion for a directed verdict grounded on\nfailure of the prosecution to show that Clark knew the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The trial court permitted Clark to introduce this evidence, whether\n\nprimarily going to insanity or lack of intent, \u201cbecause it goes to the\ninsanity issue and because we\u2019re not in front of a jury.\u201d App. 9. It also\nallowed him to make an offer of proof as to intent to preserve the issue\non appeal. Ibid.\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nvictim was a police officer.4 The judge then issued a spe\ncial verdict of first-degree murder, expressly finding that\nClark shot and caused the death of Officer Moritz beyond\na reasonable doubt and that Clark had not shown that he\nwas insane at the time. The judge noted that though\nClark was indisputably afflicted with paranoid schizo\nphrenia at the time of the shooting, the mental illness \u201cdid\nnot . . . distort his perception of reality so severely that he\ndid not know his actions were wrong.\u201d App. 334. For this\nconclusion, the judge expressly relied on \u201cthe facts of the\ncrime, the evaluations of the experts, [Clark\u2019s] actions and\nbehavior both before and after the shooting, and the ob\nservations of those that knew [Clark].\u201d Id., at 333. The\nsentence was life imprisonment without the possibility of\nrelease for 25 years.\n   Clark moved to vacate the judgment and sentence,\narguing, among other things, that Arizona\u2019s insanity test\nand its Mott rule each violate due process. As to the in\nsanity standard, Clark claimed (as he had argued earlier)\nthat the Arizona Legislature had impermissibly narrowed\nits standard in 1993 when it eliminated the first part of\nthe two-part insanity test announced in M\u2019Naghten\u2019s Case,\n10 Cl. & Fin. 200, 8 Eng. Rep. 718 (1843). The court de\nnied the motion.\n   The Court of Appeals of Arizona affirmed Clark\u2019s convic\ntion, treating the conclusion on sanity as supported by\nenough evidence to withstand review for abuse of discre\ntion, and holding the State\u2019s insanity scheme consistent\nwith due process. App. 336. As to the latter, the Court of\nAppeals reasoned that there is no constitutional require\nment to recognize an insanity defense at all, the bounds of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Clark did not at this time make an additional offer of proof, as con\ntemplated by the trial court when it ruled that it would consider\nevidence bearing on insanity as to insanity but not as to mens rea. See\nn. 3, supra.\n6                    CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich are left to the State\u2019s discretion. Beyond that, the\nappellate court followed Mott, reading it as barring the\ntrial court\u2019s consideration of evidence of Clark\u2019s mental\nillness and capacity directly on the element of mens rea.\nThe Supreme Court of Arizona denied further review.\n   We granted certiorari to decide whether due process\nprohibits Arizona from thus narrowing its insanity test or\nfrom excluding evidence of mental illness and incapacity\ndue to mental illness to rebut evidence of the requisite\ncriminal intent. 546 U. S. ___ (2005). We now affirm.\n                             II\n  Clark first says that Arizona\u2019s definition of insanity,\nbeing only a fragment of the Victorian standard from\nwhich it derives, violates due process. The landmark\nEnglish rule in M\u2019Naghten\u2019s Case, 10 Cl. & Fin. 200, 8\nEng. Rep. 718 (1843), states that\n    \u201cthe jurors ought to be told . . . that to establish a de\n    fence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly\n    proved that, at the time of the committing of the act,\n    the party accused was laboring under such a defect of\n    reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the\n    nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he\n    did know it, that he did not know he was doing what\n    was wrong.\u201d 10 Cl. & Fin., at 210, 8 Eng. Rep., at 722.\nThe first part asks about cognitive capacity: whether a\nmental defect leaves a defendant unable to understand\nwhat he is doing. The second part presents an ostensibly\nalternative basis for recognizing a defense of insanity\nunderstood as a lack of moral capacity: whether a mental\ndisease or defect leaves a defendant unable to understand\nthat his action is wrong.\n  When the Arizona Legislature first codified an insanity\nrule, it adopted the full M\u2019Naghten statement (subject to\nmodifications in details that do not matter here):\n                    Cite as: 548 U.

Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a713\u2013502\n     (West 1978).5\nIn 1993, the legislature dropped the cognitive incapacity\npart, leaving only moral incapacity as the nub of the\nstated definition. See 1993 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 256, \u00a7\u00a72\u2013\n3.6 Under current Arizona law, a defendant will not be\nadjudged insane unless he demonstrates that \u201cat the time\nof the commission of the criminal act [he] was afflicted\nwith a mental disease or defect of such severity that [he]\ndid not know the criminal act was wrong,\u201d Ariz. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. \u00a713\u2013502(A) (West 2001).\n                              A\n  Clark challenges the 1993 amendment excising the\nexpress reference to the cognitive incapacity element. He\ninsists that the side-by-side M\u2019Naghten test represents the\nminimum that a government must provide in recognizing\nan alternative to criminal responsibility on grounds of\nmental illness or defect, and he argues that elimination of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 This statutory standard followed the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s dec\n\nlaration that Arizona has \u201cuniformly adhered\u201d to the two-part\nM\u2019Naghten standard.

Louisiana,\n504 U.

The volitional\nincapacity or irresistible-impulse test, which surfaced over\ntwo centuries ago (first in England,8 then in this country9),\nasks whether a person was so lacking in volition due to a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 \u201cCapacity\u201d is understood to mean the ability to form a certain state\n\nof mind or motive, understand or evaluate one\u2019s actions, or control\nthem.\n  8 See Queen v.

ARIZONA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwith the medical concepts of mental abnormality that\ninfluence the expert opinion testimony by psychologists\nand psychiatrists commonly introduced to support or\ncontest insanity claims. For medical definitions devised to\njustify treatment, like legal ones devised to excuse from\nconventional criminal responsibility, are subject to flux\nand disagreement. See infra, at 31\u201333; cf. Leland, 343\nU. S., at 800\u2013801 (no due process violation for adopting the\nM\u2019Naghten standard rather than the irresistible-impulse\ntest because scientific knowledge does not require other\nwise and choice of test is a matter of policy). There being\nsuch fodder for reasonable debate about what the cognate\nlegal and medical tests should be, due process imposes no\nsingle canonical formulation of legal insanity.\n                             B\n   Nor does Arizona\u2019s abbreviation of the M\u2019Naghten\nstatement raise a proper claim that some constitutional\nminimum has been shortchanged. Clark\u2019s argument of\ncourse assumes that Arizona\u2019s former statement of the\nM\u2019Naghten rule, with its express alternative of cognitive\nincapacity, was constitutionally adequate (as we agree).\nThat being so, the abbreviated rule is no less so, for cogni\ntive incapacity is relevant under that statement, just as it\nwas under the more extended formulation, and evidence\ngoing to cognitive incapacity has the same significance\nunder the short form as it had under the long.\n   Though Clark is correct that the application of the\nmoral incapacity test (telling right from wrong) does not\nnecessarily require evaluation of a defendant\u2019s cognitive\ncapacity to appreciate the nature and quality of the acts\ncharged against him, see Brief for Petitioner 46\u201347, his\nargument fails to recognize that cognitive incapacity is\nitself enough to demonstrate moral incapacity. Cognitive\nincapacity, in other words, is a sufficient condition for\nestablishing a defense of insanity, albeit not a necessary\n                    Cite as: 548 U.

As a defendant can therefore make out moral inca\npacity by demonstrating cognitive incapacity, evidence\nbearing on whether the defendant knew the nature and\nquality of his actions is both relevant and admissible. In\npractical terms, if a defendant did not know what he was\ndoing when he acted, he could not have known that he was\nperforming the wrongful act charged as a crime.23 Indeed,\nwhen the two-part rule was still in effect, the Supreme\nCourt of Arizona held that a jury instruction on insanity\ncontaining the moral incapacity part but not a full recita\ntion of the cognitive incapacity part was fine, as the cogni\ntive incapacity part might be \u201c \u2018treated as adding nothing\nto the requirement that the accused know his act was\nwrong.\u2019 \u201d State v.

Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a74705 (3d ed. 1943).\nInsanity standards are formulated to guide the factfinder to determine the\nblameworthiness of a mentally ill defendant. See, e.g., Jones v. United\nStates, 463 U. S. 354, 373, n. 4 (1983) (Brennan, J., dissenting). The\nM\u2019Naghten test is a sequential test, first asking the factfinder to conduct\nthe easier enquiry whether a defendant knew the nature and quality of\nhis actions. If not, the defendant is to be considered insane and there is no\nneed to pass to the harder and broader enquiry whether the defendant\nknew his actions were wrong. And, because, owing to this sequence, the\nfactfinder is to ask whether a defendant lacks moral capacity only when\nhe possesses cognitive capacity, the only defendants who will be found to\nlack moral capacity are those possessing cognitive capacity. Cf. 2 C.\nTorcia, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7101 (15th ed. 1994). Though, before\n1993, Arizona had in place the full M\u2019Naghten test with this sequential\nenquiry, see, e.g., Schantz, 98 Ariz., at 207, 403 P. 2d, at 525, it would\nappear that the legislature eliminated the cognitive capacity part not to\nchange the meaning of the insanity standard but to implement its judg\nment that a streamlined standard with only the moral capacity part\nwould be easier for the jury to apply, see Arizona House of Representative\nJudiciary Committee Notes 3 (Mar. 18, 1993); 1 R. Gerber, Criminal Law\nof Arizona 502\u20136, 502\u201311 (2d ed. 1993 and Supp. 2000). This is corrobo\nrated by the State\u2019s choice for many years against revising the applicable\nrecommended jury instruction (enumerating the complete M\u2019Naghten test)\nin order to match the amended statutory standard.

The trial court apparently\nagreed, for the judge admitted Clark\u2019s evidence of cogni\ntive incapacity for consideration under the State\u2019s moral\nincapacity formulation. And Clark can point to no evi\ndence bearing on insanity that was excluded. His psychi\natric expert and a number of lay witnesses testified to his\ndelusions, and this evidence tended to support a descrip\ntion of Clark as lacking the capacity to understand that\nthe police officer was a human being. There is no doubt\nthat the trial judge considered the evidence as going to an\nissue of cognitive capacity, for in finding insanity not\nproven he said that Clark\u2019s mental illness \u201cdid not . . .\ndistort his perception of reality so severely that he did not\nknow his actions were wrong,\u201d App. 334.\n   We are satisfied that neither in theory nor in practice\ndid Arizona\u2019s 1993 abridgment of the insanity formulation\ndeprive Clark of due process.\n                             III\n  Clark\u2019s second claim of a due process violation chal\nlenges the rule adopted by the Supreme Court of Arizona\nin State v.

S. 1234 (1997). This case ruled on the\nadmissibility of testimony from a psychologist offered to\nshow that the defendant suffered from battered women\u2019s\nsyndrome and therefore lacked the capacity to form the\nmens rea of the crime charged against her. The opinion\nvariously referred to the testimony in issue as \u201cpsychologi\ncal testimony,\u201d 187 Ariz., at 541, 931 P. 2d, at 1051, and\n\u201cexpert testimony,\u201d ibid., and implicitly equated it with\n\u201cexpert psychiatric evidence,\u201d id., at 540, 931 P. 2d, at\n1050 (internal quotation marks omitted), and \u201cpsychiatric\n16                       CLARK v.

See id.,\nat 541, 544, 931 P. 2d, at 1051, 1054.26\n                             A\n   Understanding Clark\u2019s claim requires attention to the\ncategories of evidence with a potential bearing on mens\nrea. First, there is \u201cobservation evidence\u201d in the everyday\nsense, testimony from those who observed what Clark did\nand heard what he said; this category would also include\ntestimony that an expert witness might give about Clark\u2019s\ntendency to think in a certain way and his behavioral\ncharacteristics. This evidence may support a professional\ndiagnosis of mental disease and in any event is the kind of\nevidence that can be relevant to show what in fact was on\nClark\u2019s mind when he fired the gun. Observation evidence\nin the record covers Clark\u2019s behavior at home and with\nfriends, his expressions of belief around the time of the\nkilling that \u201caliens\u201d were inhabiting the bodies of local\npeople (including government agents),27 his driving around\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  25 We thus think the dissent reads Mott too broadly. See post, at 6\u20137\n\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (no distinction between observation and\nmental-disease testimony, see infra, at 16\u201317, or lay and expert).\n  26 The more natural reading of Mott suggests to us that this evidence\n\ncannot be considered as to mens rea even if the defendant establishes\nhis insanity, though one might read Mott otherwise.\n  27 Clark\u2019s parents testified that, in the months before the shooting\n\nand even days beforehand, Clark called them \u201caliens\u201d and thought that\n\u201caliens\u201d were out to get him. See, e.g., Tr. of Bench Trial in No. CR\n2000\u2013538, pp. 110\u2013112, 136, 226\u2013228 (Aug. 20, 2003). One night before\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

As was\ntrue here, this evidence characteristically but not always28\ncomes from professional psychologists or psychiatrists who\ntestify as expert witnesses and base their opinions in part\non examination of a defendant, usually conducted after the\nevents in question. The thrust of this evidence was that,\nbased on factual reports, professional observations, and\ntests, Clark was psychotic at the time in question, with a\ncondition that fell within the category of schizophrenia.\n  Third, there is evidence we will refer to as \u201ccapacity\nevidence\u201d about a defendant\u2019s capacity for cognition and\nmoral judgment (and ultimately also his capacity to form\nmens rea). This, too, is opinion evidence. Here, as it\nusually does,29 this testimony came from the same experts\nand concentrated on those specific details of the mental\ncondition that make the difference between sanity and\ninsanity under the Arizona definition.30 In their respec\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe shooting, according to Clark\u2019s mother, Clark repeatedly viewed a\npopular film characterized by her as telling a story about \u201caliens\u201d\nmasquerading as government agents, a story Clark insisted was real\ndespite his mother\u2019s protestations to the contrary. See id., at 59\u201360\n(Aug. 21, 2003). And two months after the shooting, Clark purportedly\ntold his parents that his hometown, Flagstaff, was inhabited principally\nby \u201caliens,\u201d who had to be stopped, and that the only way to stop them\nwas with bullets. See, e.g., id., at 131\u2013132 (Aug. 20, 2003); id., at 24\u201325\n(Aug. 21, 2003).\n  28 This is contrary to the dissent\u2019s understanding. See post, at 2\u20133\n\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.).\n  29 In conflict with the dissent\u2019s characterization, see post, at 2 (opin\n\nion of KENNEDY, J.), it does not always, however, come from experts.\n  30Arizona permits capacity evidence, see, e.g., State v. Sanchez, 117\n18                        CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntive testimony on these details the experts disagreed: the\ndefense expert gave his opinion that the symptoms or\neffects of the disease in Clark\u2019s case included inability to\nappreciate the nature of his action and to tell that it was\nwrong, whereas the State\u2019s psychiatrist was of the view\nthat Clark was a schizophrenic who was still sufficiently\nable to appreciate the reality of shooting the officer and to\nknow that it was wrong to do that.31\n   A caveat about these categories is in order. They at\ntempt to identify different kinds of testimony offered in\nthis case in terms of explicit and implicit distinctions\nmade in Mott. What we can say about these categories\ngoes to their cores, however, not their margins. Exact\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAriz. 369, 373, 573 P. 2d 60, 64 (1977); see also Ariz.

Necessarily,\nthen, our own decision can address only core issues, leav\ning for other cases any due process claims that may be\nraised about the treatment of evidence whose categoriza\ntion is subject to dispute.\n                             B\n   It is clear that Mott itself imposed no restriction on\nconsidering evidence of the first sort, the observation\nevidence. We read the Mott restriction to apply, rather, to\nevidence addressing the two issues in testimony that\ncharacteristically comes only from psychologists or psy\nchiatrists qualified to give opinions as expert witnesses:\nmental-disease evidence (whether at the time of the crime\na defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect, such\nas schizophrenia) and capacity evidence (whether the\ndisease or defect left him incapable of performing or ex\nperiencing a mental process defined as necessary for san\nity such as appreciating the nature and quality of his act\nand knowing that it was wrong).\n   Mott was careful to distinguish this kind of opinion\nevidence from observation evidence generally and even\nfrom observation evidence that an expert witness might\noffer, such as descriptions of a defendant\u2019s tendency to\nthink in a certain way or his behavioral characteristics;\nthe Arizona court made it clear that this sort of testimony\nwas perfectly admissible to rebut the prosecution\u2019s evi\ndence of mens rea, 187 Ariz., at 544, 931 P. 2d, at 1054.\nThus, only opinion testimony going to mental defect or\ndisease, and its effect on the cognitive or moral capaci\nties on which sanity depends under the Arizona rule, is\nrestricted.\n20                       CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  In this case, the trial court seems to have applied the\nMott restriction to all evidence offered by Clark for the\npurpose of showing what he called his inability to form the\nrequired mens rea, see, e.g., Record, Doc. 406, pp. 7\u201310,\n(that is, an intent to kill a police officer on duty, or an\nunderstanding that he was engaging in the act of killing\nsuch an officer, see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a713\u20131105(A)(3)\n(West Supp. 2005)). Thus, the trial court\u2019s restriction may\nhave covered not only mental-disease and capacity evi\ndence as just defined, but also observation evidence of\nfered by lay (and expert) witnesses who described Clark\u2019s\nunusual behavior. Clark\u2019s objection to the application of\nthe Mott rule does not, however, turn on the distinction\nbetween lay and expert witnesses or the kinds of testi\nmony they were competent to present.32\n                              C\n   There is some, albeit limited, disagreement between the\ndissent and ourselves about the scope of the claim of error\nproperly before us. To start with matters of agreement, all\nMembers of the Court agree that Clark\u2019s general attack on\nthe Mott rule covers its application in confining considera\ntion of capacity evidence to the insanity defense.\n   In practical terms, our agreement on issues presented\nextends to a second point. JUSTICE KENNEDY understands\nthat Clark raised an objection to confining mental-disease\nevidence to the insanity issue. As he sees it, Clark in\neffect claimed that in dealing with the issue of mens rea\nthe trial judge should have considered expert testimony on\nwhat may characteristically go through the mind of a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  32 With respect to \u201cthe limited factual issues the trial court held it\n\ncould consider under [Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7]13\u2013502 and Mott, defense\ncounsel made no additional \u2018offer of proof\u2019 at the conclusion of the case\nbut preserved [Clark\u2019s] legal contentions by asking the court to consider\nall of the evidence presented in determining whether the state had\nproved its case.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 10, n. 20 (citations omitted).\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nschizophrenic, when the judge considered what in fact was\nin Clark\u2019s mind at the time of the shooting. See post, at 3\n(dissenting opinion) (\u201c[T]he opinion that Clark had para\nnoid schizophrenia\u2014an opinion shared by experts for both\nthe prosecution and defense\u2014bears on efforts to deter\nmine, as a factual matter, whether he knew he was killing\na police officer\u201d). He thus understands that defense coun\nsel claimed a right to rebut the State\u2019s mens rea demon\nstration with testimony about how schizophrenics may\nhallucinate voices and other sounds, about their character\nistic failure to distinguish the content of their imagination\nfrom what most people perceive as exterior reality, and so\non. It is important to be clear that this supposed objection\nwas not about dealing with testimony based on observa\ntion of Clark showing that he had auditory hallucinations\nwhen he was driving around, or failed in fact to appreciate\nobjective reality when he shot; this objection went to use of\ntestimony about schizophrenics, not about Clark in par\nticular. While we might dispute how clearly Clark raised\nthis objection, we have no doubt that the objection falls\nwithin a general challenge to the Mott rule; we understand\nthat Mott is meant to confine to the insanity defense any\nconsideration of characteristic behavior associated with\nmental disease, see 187 Ariz., at 544, 931 P. 2d, at 1054\n(contrasting State v. Christensen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 628 P. 2d\n580 (1991), and State v.

We will therefore assume for argument that\nClark raised this claim, as we consider the due process\nchallenge to the Mott rule.\n   The point on which we disagree with the dissent, how\never, is this: did Clark apprise the Arizona courts that he\nbelieved the trial judge had erroneously limited the con\nsideration of observation evidence, whether from lay wit\nnesses like Clark\u2019s mother or (possibly) the expert wit\nnesses who observed him? This sort of evidence was not\ncovered by the Mott restriction, and confining it to the\n22                        CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ninsanity issue would have been an erroneous application\nof Mott as a matter of Arizona law. For the following\nreasons we think no such objection was made in a way the\nArizona courts could have understood it, and that no such\nissue is before us now. We think the only issue properly\nbefore us is the challenge to Mott on due process grounds,\ncomprising objections to limits on the use of mental-\ndisease and capacity evidence.\n  It is clear that the trial judge intended to apply Mott:\n     \u201c[R]ecognizing that much of the evidence that [the de\n     fense is] going to be submitting, in fact all of it, as far\n     as I know . . . that has to do with the insanity could\n     also arguably be made along the lines of the Mott is\n     sue as to form and intent and his capacity for the in\n     tent. I\u2019m going to let you go ahead and get all that\n     stuff in because it goes to the insanity issue and be\n     cause we\u2019re not in front of a jury. At the end, I\u2019ll let\n     you make an offer of proof as to the intent, the Mott\n     issues, but I still think the supreme court decision is\n     the law of the land in this state.\u201d App. 9.\n  At no point did the trial judge specify any particular\nevidence that he refused to consider on the mens rea issue.\nNor did defense counsel specify any observation or other\nparticular evidence that he claimed was admissible but\nwrongly excluded on the issue of mens rea, so as to pro\nduce a clearer ruling on what evidence was being re\nstricted on the authority of Mott and what was not. He\nmade no \u201coffer of proof\u201d in the trial court;33 and although\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  33 We do not agree with the State\u2019s argument that the failure to make\n\nan offer of proof, see n. 4, supra, is a bar to pressing Clark\u2019s claim about\nthe admissibility of mental-illness or capacity evidence as to mens rea,\nsee Brief for Respondent 27\u201329, especially when the Arizona Court of\nAppeals rejected Clark\u2019s argument on the merits rather than clearly on\nthis ground, see App. 351\u2013353; see also Michigan v.

Ct. App.), pp. 48\u201349 (hereinafter Appellant\u2019s\nOpening Brief), he was no more specific than that, see,\ne.g., id., at 52 (\u201cThe Court\u2019s ruling in Mott and the trial\ncourt\u2019s refusal to consider whether as a result of suffering\nfrom paranoid schizophrenia [Clark] could not formulate\nthe mens rea necessary for first degree murder violated his\nright to due process\u201d). Similarly, we read the Arizona\nCourt of Appeals to have done nothing more than rely on\nMott to reject the claim that due process forbids restricting\nevidence bearing on \u201c[a]bility to [f]orm [m]ens [r]ea,\u201d App.\n351 (emphasis in original), (i.e., mental-disease and capac\nity evidence) to the insanity determination. See id., at\n351\u2013353.\n   This failure in the state courts to raise any clear claim\nabout observation evidence, see Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief\n46\u201352, is reflected in the material addressed to us, see\nBrief for Petitioner 13\u201332. In this Court both the question\npresented and the following statement of his position were\ncouched in similarly worded general terms:\n     \u201cI. ERIC WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS WHEN THE\n     TRIAL    COURT    REFUSED  TO   CONSIDER\n     EVIDENCE OF HIS SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS IN\n     DETERMINING FACTUALLY WHETHER THE\n     PROSECUTION      PROVED    THE   MENTAL\n     ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME CHARGED.\u201d Id., at 13.\nBut as his counsel made certain beyond doubt in his reply\nbrief, \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ncourt relied upon an adequate and independent state ground and . . . it \n\nfairly appears that the state court rested its decision primarily on\nfederal law\u201d).\n24                        CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n     \u201cEric\u2019s Point I is and always has been an attack on the\n     rule of State v. Mott, which both courts below held ap\n     plicable and binding. Mott announced a categorical\n     \u2018rejection of the use of psychological testimony to chal\n     lenge the mens rea element of a crime,\u2019 and upheld\n     this rule against federal due process challenge.\u201d Re\n     ply Brief for Petitioner 2 (citations omitted).\nThis explanation is supported by other statements in\nClark\u2019s briefs in both the State Court of Appeals and this\nCourt, replete with the consistently maintained claim that\nit was error to limit evidence of mental illness and inca\npacity to its bearing on the insanity defense, excluding it\nfrom consideration on the element of mens rea. See, e.g.,\nAppellant\u2019s Opening Brief 46, 47, 51; Brief for Petitioner\n11, 13, 16, 20\u201323.\n   In sum, the trial court\u2019s ruling, with its uncertain edges,\nmay have restricted observation evidence admissible on\nmens rea to the insanity defense alone, but we cannot be\nsure.34 But because a due process challenge to such a\nrestriction of observation evidence was, by our measure,\nneither pressed nor passed upon in the Arizona Court of\nAppeals, we do not consider it. See, e.g., Kentucky v. Stin\ncer, 482 U. S. 730, 747, n. 22 (1987); Illinois v. Gates, 462\nU. S. 213, 217\u2013224 (1983). What we do know, and now\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  34We therefore have no reason to believe that the courts of Arizona\n\nwould have failed to restrict their application of Mott to the professional\ntestimony the Mott opinion was stated to cover, if Clark\u2019s counsel had\nspecified any observation evidence he claimed to be generally admissi\nble and relevant to mens rea. Nothing that we hold here is authority\nfor restricting a factfinder\u2019s consideration of observation evidence\nindicating state of mind at the time of a criminal offense (conventional\nmens rea evidence) as distinct from professional mental-disease or\ncapacity evidence going to ability to form a certain state of mind during\na period that includes the time of the offense charged. And, of course,\nnothing held here prevents Clark from raising this discrete claim when\nthe case returns to the courts of Arizona, if consistent with the State\u2019s\nprocedural rules.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           25\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconsider, is Clark\u2019s claim that Mott denied due process\nbecause it \u201cpreclude[d] Eric from contending that . . .\nfactual inferences\u201d of the \u201cmental states which were neces\nsary elements of the crime charged\u201d \u201cshould not be drawn\nbecause the behavior was explainable, instead, as a mani\nfestation of his chronic paranoid schizophrenia.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner 13 (emphasis in original). We consider the\nclaim, as Clark otherwise puts it, that \u201cArizona\u2019s prohibi\ntion of \u2018diminished capacity\u2019 evidence by criminal defen\ndants violates\u201d due process, ibid.\n                            D\n  Clark\u2019s argument that the Mott rule violates the Four\nteenth Amendment guarantee of due process turns on the\napplication of the presumption of innocence in criminal\ncases, the presumption of sanity, and the principle that a\ncriminal defendant is entitled to present relevant and\nfavorable evidence on an element of the offense charged\nagainst him.\n                             1\n  The first presumption is that a defendant is innocent\nunless and until the government proves beyond a reason\nable doubt each element of the offense charged, see Patter\nson, 432 U. S., at 210\u2013211; In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358,\n361\u2013364 (1970), including the mental element or mens rea.\nBefore the last century, the mens rea required to be proven\nfor particular offenses was often described in general\nterms like \u201cmalice,\u201d see, e.g., In re Eckart, 166 U. S. 481\n(1897); 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *21 (\u201c[A]n unwar\nrantable act without a vicious will is no crime at all\u201d), but\nthe modern tendency has been toward more specific de\nscriptions, as shown in the Arizona statute defining the\nmurder charged against Clark: the State had to prove that\nin acting to kill the victim, Clark intended to kill a law\nenforcement officer on duty or knew that the victim was\n26                        CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsuch an officer on duty. See generally Gardner, The Mens\nRea Enigma: Observations on the Role of Motive in the\nCriminal Law Past and Present, 1993 Utah L. Rev. 635.\nAs applied to mens rea (and every other element), the force\nof the presumption of innocence is measured by the force\nof the showing needed to overcome it, which is proof be\nyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant\u2019s state of mind\nwas in fact what the charge states. See Winship, supra, at\n361\u2013363.\n                              2\n   The presumption of sanity is equally universal in some\nvariety or other, being (at least) a presumption that a\ndefendant has the capacity to form the mens rea necessary\nfor a verdict of guilt and the consequent criminal respon\nsibility. See Leland, 343 U. S., at 799; Davis v. United\nStates, 160 U. S. 469, 486\u2013487 (1895); M\u2019Naghten\u2019s Case, 10\nCl. & Fin., at 210, 8 Eng. Rep., at 722; see generally 1\nLaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a78.3(a), at 598\u2013599,\nand n. 1. This presumption dispenses with a requirement\non the government\u2019s part to include as an element of every\ncriminal charge an allegation that the defendant had such\na capacity.35 The force of this presumption, like the pre\nsumption of innocence, is measured by the quantum of\nevidence necessary to overcome it; unlike the presumption\nof innocence, however, the force of the presumption of\nsanity varies across the many state and federal jurisdic\ntions, and prior law has recognized considerable leeway on\nthe part of the legislative branch in defining the presump\ntion\u2019s strength through the kind of evidence and degree of\npersuasiveness necessary to overcome it, see Fisher v.\n\nUnited States, 328 U. S. 463, 466\u2013476 (1946).36\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n  35 A  legislature is nonetheless free to require affirmative proof of san\nity by the way it describes a criminal offense, see Dixon v.

First, a State may allow\na defendant to introduce (and a factfinder to consider)\nevidence of mental disease or incapacity for the bearing it\ncan have on the government\u2019s burden to show mens rea.\nSee, e.g., State v. Perez, 882 A. 2d 574, 584 (R. I. 2005).37\nIn such States the evidence showing incapacity to form the\nguilty state of mind, for example, qualifies the probative\nforce of other evidence, which considered alone indicates\nthat the defendant actually formed the guilty state of\nmind. If it is shown that a defendant with mental disease\nthinks all blond people are robots, he could not have in\ntended to kill a person when he shot a man with blond\nhair, even though he seemed to act like a man shooting\nanother man.38 In jurisdictions that allow mental-disease\nand capacity evidence to be considered on par with any\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nlent to a Sandstrom presumption. See Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S.\n510, 514\u2013524 (1979) (due process forbids use of presumption that relieves\nthe prosecution of burden of proving mental state by inference of intent\nfrom an act).\n   37 In fact, Oregon had this scheme in place when we decided Leland v.\n\nOregon, 343 U. S. 790, 794\u2013796 (1952). We do not, however, read any\npart of Leland to require as a matter of due process that evidence of\nincapacity be considered to rebut the mens rea element of a crime.\n   38We reject the State\u2019s argument that mens rea and insanity, as cur\n\nrently understood, are entirely distinguishable, so that mental-disease\nand capacity evidence relevant to insanity is simply irrelevant to mens\nrea. Not only does evidence accepted as showing insanity trump mens\nrea, but evidence of behavior close to the time of the act charged may\nindicate both the actual state of mind at that time and also an enduring\nincapacity to form the criminal state of mind necessary to the offense\ncharged. See Brief for American Psychiatric Association et al. as Amici\nCuriae 12\u201313; Arenella, The Diminished Capacity and Diminished\nResponsibility Defenses: Two Children of a Doomed Marriage, 77\nColum. L. Rev. 827, 834\u2013835 (1977); cf. Powell v. Texas, 392 U. S. 514,\n535\u2013536 (1968) (plurality opinion) (the \u201cdoctrines of actus reus, mens rea,\ninsanity, mistake, justification, and duress\u201d are a \u201ccollection of interlock\ning and overlapping concepts which the common law has utilized to assess\nthe moral accountability of an individual for his antisocial deeds\u201d).\n28                   CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nother relevant evidence when deciding whether the prose\ncution has proven mens rea beyond a reasonable doubt,\nthe evidence of mental disease or incapacity need only\nsupport what the factfinder regards as a reasonable doubt\nabout the capacity to form (or the actual formation of) the\nmens rea, in order to require acquittal of the charge.\nThus, in these States the strength of the presumption of\nsanity is no greater than the strength of the evidence of\nabnormal mental state that the factfinder thinks is\nenough to raise a reasonable doubt.\n   The second point where the force of the presumption of\nsanity may be tested is in the consideration of a defense of\ninsanity raised by a defendant.          Insanity rules like\nM\u2019Naghten and the variants discussed in Part II, supra,\nare attempts to define, or at least to indicate, the kinds of\nmental differences that overcome the presumption of\nsanity or capacity and therefore excuse a defendant from\ncustomary criminal responsibility, see Jones, 463 U. S., at\n373, n. 4 (Brennan, J., dissenting); D. Hermann, The Insan\nity Defense: Philosophical, Historical and Legal Perspec\ntives 4 (1983) (\u201cA central significance of the insanity de\nfense . . . is the separation of nonblameworthy from\nblameworthy offenders\u201d), even if the prosecution has\notherwise overcome the presumption of innocence by\nconvincing the factfinder of all the elements charged be\nyond a reasonable doubt. The burden that must be carried\nby a defendant who raises the insanity issue, again, de\nfines the strength of the sanity presumption. A State may\nprovide, for example, that whenever the defendant raises\na claim of insanity by some quantum of credible evidence,\nthe presumption disappears and the government must\nprove sanity to a specified degree of certainty (whether\nbeyond reasonable doubt or something less).

Rev.\nStat. Ann. \u00a713\u2013502(C) (West 2001); Leland, 343 U. S., at\n798. In any case, the defendant\u2019s burden defines the\npresumption of sanity, whether that burden be to burst a\nbubble or to show something more.\n                             3\n  The third principle implicated by Clark\u2019s argument is a\ndefendant\u2019s right as a matter of simple due process to\npresent evidence favorable to himself on an element that\nmust be proven to convict him.39 As already noted, evi\ndence tending to show that a defendant suffers from men\ntal disease and lacks capacity to form mens rea is relevant\nto rebut evidence that he did in fact form the required\nmens rea at the time in question; this is the reason that\nClark claims a right to require the factfinder in this case\nto consider testimony about his mental illness and his\nincapacity directly, when weighing the persuasiveness of\nother evidence tending to show mens rea, which the prose\ncution has the burden to prove.\n  As Clark recognizes, however, the right to introduce\nrelevant evidence can be curtailed if there is a good reason\nfor doing that. \u201cWhile the Constitution . . . prohibits the\nexclusion of defense evidence under rules that serve no\nlegitimate purpose or that are disproportionate to the ends\nthat they are asserted to promote, well-established rules of\nevidence permit trial judges to exclude evidence if its\nprobative value is outweighed by certain other factors\nsuch as unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or poten\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  39 Clark\u2019s argument assumes that Arizona\u2019s rule is a rule of evidence,\n\nrather than a redefinition of mens rea, see Montana v. Egelhoff, 518\nU. S. 37, 58\u201359 (1996) (GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 71\n(O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting). We have no reason to view the rule otherwise,\nand on this assumption, it does not violate due process, see infra, at 31\u2013\n39.\n30                   CLARK v.

S. 284, 302 (1973).\nAnd if evidence may be kept out entirely, its consideration\nmay be subject to limitation, which Arizona claims the\npower to impose here. State law says that evidence of\nmental disease and incapacity may be introduced and\nconsidered, and if sufficiently forceful to satisfy the defen\ndant\u2019s burden of proof under the insanity rule it will dis\nplace the presumption of sanity and excuse from criminal\nresponsibility. But mental-disease and capacity evidence\nmay be considered only for its bearing on the insanity\ndefense, and it will avail a defendant only if it is persua\nsive enough to satisfy the defendant\u2019s burden as defined\nby the terms of that defense. The mental-disease and\ncapacity evidence is thus being channeled or restricted to\none issue and given effect only if the defendant carries the\nburden to convince the factfinder of insanity; the evidence\nis not being excluded entirely, and the question is whether\nreasons for requiring it to be channeled and restricted are\ngood enough to satisfy the standard of fundamental fair\nness that due process requires. We think they are.\n                             E\n                             1\n  The first reason supporting the Mott rule is Arizona\u2019s\nauthority to define its presumption of sanity (or capacity\nor responsibility) by choosing an insanity definition, as\ndiscussed in Part II, supra, and by placing the burden of\npersuasion on defendants who claim incapacity as an\nexcuse from customary criminal responsibility.

And Clark presses no objection to Arizona\u2019s\ndecision to require persuasion to a clear and convincing\ndegree before the presumption of sanity and normal re\nsponsibility is overcome. See Brief for Petitioner 18, n. 25.\n   But if a State is to have this authority in practice as\nwell as in theory, it must be able to deny a defendant the\nopportunity to displace the presumption of sanity more\neasily when addressing a different issue in the course of\nthe criminal trial. Yet, as we have explained, just such an\nopportunity would be available if expert testimony of\nmental disease and incapacity could be considered for\nwhatever a factfinder might think it was worth on the\nissue of mens rea.40 As we mentioned, the presumption of\nsanity would then be only as strong as the evidence a\nfactfinder would accept as enough to raise a reasonable\ndoubt about mens rea for the crime charged; once reason\nable doubt was found, acquittal would be required, and the\nstandards established for the defense of insanity would go\nby the boards.\n   Now, a State is of course free to accept such a possibility\nin its law. After all, it is free to define the insanity de\nfense by treating the presumption of sanity as a bursting\nbubble, whose disappearance shifts the burden to the\nprosecution to prove sanity whenever a defendant pre\nsents any credible evidence of mental disease or incapac\nity. In States with this kind of insanity rule, the legisla\nture may well be willing to allow such evidence to be\nconsidered on the mens rea element for whatever the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   40 Cf. post, at 3 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe psychiatrist\u2019s explana\n\ntion of Clark\u2019s condition was essential to understanding how he proc\nesses sensory data and therefore to deciding what information was in\nhis mind at the time of the shooting.

What counts for due process,\nhowever, is simply that a State that wishes to avoid a\nsecond avenue for exploring capacity, less stringent for a\ndefendant, has a good reason for confining the considera\ntion of evidence of mental disease and incapacity to the\ninsanity defense.\n   It is obvious that Arizona\u2019s Mott rule reflects such a\nchoice. The State Supreme Court pointed out that the\nState had declined to adopt a defense of diminished capac\nity (allowing a jury to decide when to excuse a defendant\nbecause of greater than normal difficulty in conforming to\nthe law).41 The court reasoned that the State\u2019s choice\nwould be undercut if evidence of incapacity could be con\nsidered for whatever a jury might think sufficient to raise\na reasonable doubt about mens rea, even if it did not show\ninsanity. 187 Ariz., at 541, 931 P. 2d, at 1051. In other\nwords, if a jury were free to decide how much evidence of\nmental disease and incapacity was enough to counter\nevidence of mens rea to the point of creating a reasonable\ndoubt, that would in functional terms be analogous to\nallowing jurors to decide upon some degree of diminished\ncapacity to obey the law, a degree set by them, that would\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   41 Though the term \u201cdiminished capacity\u201d has been given different\n\nmeanings, see, e.g., Morse, Undiminished Confusion in Diminished\nCapacity, 75 J.

See post, at 10\u201318 (opinion of\nKENNEDY, J.). An insanity rule gives a defendant already\nfound guilty the opportunity to excuse his conduct by\nshowing he was insane when he acted, that is, that he did\nnot have the mental capacity for conventional guilt and\ncriminal responsibility. But, as the dissent argues, if the\nsame evidence that affirmatively shows he was not guilty\nby reason of insanity (or \u201cguilty except insane\u201d under\nArizona law, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a713\u2013502(A) (West\n2001)) also shows it was at least doubtful that he could\nform mens rea, then he should not be found guilty in the\nfirst place; it thus violates due process when the State\nimpedes him from using mental-disease and capacity\nevidence directly to rebut the prosecution\u2019s evidence that\nhe did form mens rea.\n   Are there, then, characteristics of mental-disease and\ncapacity evidence giving rise to risks that may reasonably\nbe hedged by channeling the consideration of such evi\ndence to the insanity issue on which, in States like Ari\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   42 It is beyond question that Arizona may preclude such a defense, see\n\nFisher v. United States, 328 U. S. 463, 466\u2013476 (1946), and there is no\ndoubt that the Arizona Legislature meant to do so, see Ariz. Rev.

We think\nthere are: in the controversial character of some categories\nof mental disease, in the potential of mental-disease evi\ndence to mislead, and in the danger of according greater\ncertainty to capacity evidence than experts claim for it.\n   To begin with, the diagnosis may mask vigorous debate\nwithin the profession about the very contours of the men\ntal disease itself. See, e.g., American Psychiatric Associa\ntion, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor\nders xxxiii (4th ed. text rev. 2000) (hereinafter DSM\u2013IV\u2013\nTR) (\u201cDSM\u2013IV reflects a consensus about the classification\nand diagnosis of mental disorders derived at the time of its\ninitial publication. New knowledge generated by research\nor clinical experience will undoubtedly lead to an in\ncreased understanding of the disorders included in DSM\u2013\nIV, to the identification of new disorders, and to the re\nmoval of some disorders in future classifications.

Even when a category of mental\ndisease is broadly accepted and the assignment of a defen\ndant\u2019s behavior to that category is uncontroversial, the\nclassification may suggest something very significant\nabout a defendant\u2019s capacity, when in fact the classifica\ntion tells us little or nothing about the ability of the defen\ndant to form mens rea or to exercise the cognitive, moral,\nor volitional capacities that define legal sanity.43 See\nDSM\u2013IV\u2013TR xxxii\u2013xxxiii (\u201cWhen the DSM\u2013IV categories,\ncriteria, and textual descriptions are employed for forensic\npurposes, there are significant risks that diagnostic infor\nmation will be misused or misunderstood. These dangers\narise because of the imperfect fit between the questions of\nultimate concern to the law and the information contained\nin a clinical diagnosis. In most situations, the clinical\ndiagnosis of a DSM\u2013IV mental disorder is not sufficient to\nestablish the existence for legal purposes of . . . \u2018mental\ndiseas[e]\u2019 or \u2018mental defect.\u2019 In determining whether an\nindividual meets a specified legal standard (e.g., for . . .\ncriminal responsibility . . .), additional information is\nusually required beyond that contained in the DSM\u2013IV\ndiagnosis\u201d).

ARIZONA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndisease diagnosis are evident in the dispute between the\ntwo testifying experts in this case; they agree that Clark\nwas schizophrenic, but they come to opposite conclusions\non whether the mental disease in his particular case left\nhim bereft of cognitive or moral capacity. Evidence of\nmental disease, then, can easily mislead; it is very easy to\nslide from evidence that an individual with a profession\nally recognized mental disease is very different, into\ndoubting that he has the capacity to form mens rea,\nwhereas that doubt may not be justified. And of course, in\nthe cases mentioned before, in which the categorization is\ndoubtful or the category of mental disease is itself subject\nto controversy, the risks are even greater that opinions\nabout mental disease may confuse a jury into thinking the\nopinions show more than they do. Because allowing men\ntal-disease evidence on mens rea can thus easily mislead,\nit is not unreasonable to address that tendency by con-\nfining consideration of this kind of evidence to insanity,\non which a defendant may be assigned the burden of\npersuasion.\n   There are, finally, particular risks inherent in the opin\nions of the experts who supplement the mental-disease\nclassifications with opinions on incapacity: on whether the\nmental disease rendered a particular defendant incapable\nof the cognition necessary for moral judgment or mens rea\nor otherwise incapable of understanding the wrongfulness\nof the conduct charged. Unlike observational evidence\nbearing on mens rea, capacity evidence consists of judg\nment, and judgment fraught with multiple perils: a defen\ndant\u2019s state of mind at the crucial moment can be elusive\nno matter how conscientious the enquiry, and the law\u2019s\ncategories that set the terms of the capacity judgment are\nnot the categories of psychology that govern the expert\u2019s\nprofessional thinking. Although such capacity judgments\nmay be given in the utmost good faith, their potentially\ntenuous character is indicated by the candor of the defense\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

Contrary to the State\u2019s expert, he\ntestified that Clark lacked the capacity to appreciate the\ncircumstances realistically and to understand the wrong\nfulness of what he was doing, App. 48\u201349, but he said that\n\u201cno one knows exactly what was on [his] mind\u201d at the time\nof the shooting, id., at 48. And even when an expert is\nconfident that his understanding of the mind is reliable,\njudgment addressing the basic categories of capacity\nrequires a leap from the concepts of psychology, which are\ndevised for thinking about treatment, to the concepts of\nlegal sanity, which are devised for thinking about criminal\nresponsibility. See Insanity Defense Work Group, Ameri\ncan Psychiatric Association Statement on the Insanity\nDefense, 140 Am. J. Psychiatry 681, 686 (1983), reprinted\nin 2 The Role of Mental Illness in Criminal Trials 117, 122\n(J.

R. Slovenko, Psy\nchiatry and Criminal Culpability 55 (1995) (\u201cThe scope of\nthe DSM is wide-ranging and includes \u2018conduct disorders\u2019\nbut \u2018evil\u2019 is not mentioned\u201d). In sum, these empirical and\nconceptual problems add up to a real risk that an expert\u2019s\njudgment in giving capacity evidence will come with an\napparent authority that psychologists and psychiatrists do\nnot claim to have. We think that this risk, like the diffi\nculty in assessing the significance of mental-disease evi\ndence, supports the State\u2019s decision to channel such expert\ntestimony to consideration on the insanity defense, on\nwhich the party seeking the benefit of this evidence has\nthe burden of persuasion.\n   It bears repeating that not every State will find it\nworthwhile to make the judgment Arizona has made, and\nthe choices the States do make about dealing with the\nrisks posed by mental-disease and capacity evidence will\nreflect their varying assessments about the presumption\nof sanity as expressed in choices of insanity rules.44 The\npoint here simply is that Arizona has sensible reasons\nto assign the risks as it has done by channeling the\nevidence.45\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   44 A State in which the burden of persuasion as to a defendant\u2019s san\n\nity lies with the prosecution might also be justified in restricting\nmental-disease and capacity evidence to insanity determinations owing\nto the potential of mental-disease evidence to mislead and the risk of\nmisjudgment inherent in capacity evidence. We need not, in the\ncontext of this case, address that issue.\n   45 Arizona\u2019s rule is supported by a further practical reason, though\n\nnot as weighty as those just considered. As mentioned before, if sub\nstantial mental-disease and capacity evidence is accepted as rebutting\nmens rea in a given case, the affirmative defense of insanity will proba\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

But if a defendant succeeds in showing himself insane, Arizona\nlaw (and presumably that of every other State with an insanity rule)\nwill require commitment and treatment as a consequence of that\nfinding without more. It makes sense, then, to channel capacity evi\ndence to the issue structured to deal with mental incapacity when such\na claim is raised successfully. See, e.g., Jones, 463 U.

Ante, at 16\u201318.\n   I agree with the Court\u2019s basic categorization.

Its reasons and conclusions lead me to file this\nrespectful dissent.\n  Since I would reverse the judgment of the Arizona Court\nof Appeals on this ground, and the Arizona courts might\nwell alter their interpretation of the State\u2019s criminal re\nsponsibility statute were my rationale to prevail, it is\nunnecessary for me to address the argument that Ari\nzona\u2019s definition of insanity violates due process.\n                             I\n  Clark claims that the trial court erred in refusing to\nconsider evidence of his chronic paranoid schizophrenia in\ndeciding whether he possessed the knowledge or intent\nrequired for first-degree murder. Seizing upon a theory\ninvented here by the Court itself, the Court narrows\nClark\u2019s claim so he cannot raise the point everyone else\nthought was involved in the case. The Court says the only\n2                    CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nissue before us is whether there is a right to introduce\nmental-disease evidence or capacity evidence, not a right\nto introduce observation evidence. See ante, at 15\u201325.\nThis restructured evidentiary universe, with no convincing\nauthority to support it, is unworkable on its own terms.\nEven were that not so, however, the Court\u2019s tripartite\nstructure is something not addressed by the state trial\ncourt, the state appellate court, counsel on either side in\nthose proceedings, or the briefs the parties filed with us.\nThe Court refuses to consider the key part of Clark\u2019s claim\nbecause his counsel did not predict the Court\u2019s own inven\ntion. It is unrealistic, and most unfair, to hold that Clark\u2019s\ncounsel erred in failing to anticipate so novel an approach.\nIf the Court is to insist on its approach, at a minimum the\ncase should be remanded to determine whether Clark is\nbound by his counsel\u2019s purported waiver.\n   The Court\u2019s error, of course, has significance beyond this\ncase. It adopts an evidentiary framework that, in my\nview, will be unworkable in many cases. The Court classi\nfies Clark\u2019s behavior and expressed beliefs as observation\nevidence but insists that its description by experts must be\nmental-disease evidence or capacity evidence. See ante, at\n16\u201318. These categories break down quickly when it is\nunderstood how the testimony would apply to the question\nof intent and knowledge at issue here. The most common\ntype of schizophrenia, and the one Clark suffered from, is\nparanoid schizophrenia. See P. Berner et al., Diagnostic\nCriteria for Functional Psychoses 37 (2d ed. 1992). The\nexistence of this functional psychosis is beyond dispute,\nbut that does not mean the lay witness understands it or\nthat a disputed issue of fact concerning its effect in a\nparticular instance is not something for the expert to\naddress. Common symptoms of the condition are delu\nsions accompanied by hallucinations, often of the auditory\ntype, which can cause disturbances of perception. Ibid.\nClark\u2019s expert testified that people with schizophrenia\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\noften play radios loudly to drown out the voices in their\nheads. See App. 32. Clark\u2019s attorney argued to the trial\ncourt that this, rather than a desire to lure a policeman to\nthe scene, explained Clark\u2019s behavior just before the kill\ning. Id., at 294\u2013295. The observation that schizophrenics\nplay radios loudly is a fact regarding behavior, but it is\nonly a relevant fact if Clark has schizophrenia.\n   Even if this evidence were, to use the Court\u2019s term,\nmental-disease evidence, because it relies on an expert\nopinion, what would happen if the expert simply were to\ntestify, without mentioning schizophrenia, that people\nwith Clark\u2019s symptoms often play the radio loudly? This\nseems to be factual evidence, as the term is defined by the\nCourt, yet it differs from mental-disease evidence only in\nforcing the witness to pretend that no one has yet come up\nwith a way to classify the set of symptoms being described.\nMore generally, the opinion that Clark had paranoid\nschizophrenia\u2014an opinion shared by experts for both the\nprosecution and defense\u2014bears on efforts to determine, as\na factual matter, whether he knew he was killing a police\nofficer. The psychiatrist\u2019s explanation of Clark\u2019s condition\nwas essential to understanding how he processes sensory\ndata and therefore to deciding what information was in his\nmind at the time of the shooting. Simply put, knowledge\nrelies on cognition, and cognition can be affected by\nschizophrenia. See American Psychiatric Association,\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\n299 (4th ed. text rev. 2000) (\u201cThe characteristic symptoms\nof Schizophrenia involve a range of cognitive and emo\ntional dysfunctions that include perception\u201d); ibid. (Symp\ntoms include delusions, which are \u201cerroneous beliefs that\nusually involve a misinterpretation of perceptions or\nexperiences\u201d). The mental-disease evidence at trial was\nalso intertwined with the observation evidence because it\nlent needed credibility. Clark\u2019s parents and friends testi\nfied Clark thought the people in his town were aliens\n4                    CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ntrying to kill him. These claims might not be believable\nwithout a psychiatrist confirming the story based on his\nexperience with people who have exhibited similar behav\niors. It makes little sense to divorce the observation evi\ndence from the explanation that makes it comprehensible.\n   Assuming the Court\u2019s tripartite structure were feasible,\nthe Court is incorrect when it narrows Clark\u2019s claim to\nexclude any concern about observation evidence. In decid\ning Clark\u2019s counsel failed to raise this issue, the Court\nrelies on a series of perceived ambiguities regarding how\nthe claim fits within the Court\u2019s own categories. See ante,\nat 15\u201325. The Court cites no precedent for construing\nthese ambiguities against the claimant and no prudential\nreason for ignoring the breadth of Clark\u2019s claim. It is\nparticularly surprising that the Court does so to the det\nriment of a criminal defendant asserting the fundamental\nchallenge that the trier of fact refused to consider critical\nevidence showing he is innocent of the crime charged.\n   The alleged ambiguities are, in any event, illusory. The\nevidence at trial addressed more than the question of\ngeneral incapacity or opinions regarding mental illness; it\nwent further, as it included so-called observation evidence\nrelevant to Clark\u2019s mental state at the moment he shot the\nofficer. There was testimony, for example, that Clark\nthought the people in his town, particularly government\nofficials, were not human beings but aliens who were\ntrying to kill him. See App. 119\u2013121, 131\u2013132, 192\u2013197,\n249\u2013256; Tr. of Bench Trial in No. CR\u20132000\u2013538, pp. 110\u2013\n112, 131\u2013132, 136, 226\u2013228 (Aug. 20, 2003); id., at 24\u201325,\n59\u201360 (Aug. 21, 2003). The Court recognizes the existence\nof this essential observation evidence. See ante, at 16\u201317.\n   The Court holds, nonetheless, that \u201cwe cannot be sure\u201d\nwhether the trial court failed to consider this evidence.\nAnte, at 24. It is true the trial court ruling was not per\nfectly clear. Its language does strongly suggest, though,\nthat it did not consider any of this testimony in deciding\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            5\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nwhether Clark had the knowledge or intent required for\nfirst-degree murder. After recognizing that \u201cmuch of the\nevidence that [the defense is] going to be submitting, in\nfact all of it, as far as I know . . . that has to do with the\ninsanity could also arguably be made . . . as to form and\nintent and his capacity for the intent,\u201d the court concluded\n\u201cwe will be focusing, as far as I\u2019m concerned, strictly on\nthe insanity defense.\u201d App. 9. In announcing its verdict,\nthe trial court did not mention any of the mental-illness\nevidence, observation or otherwise, in deciding Clark\u2019s\nguilt. Id., at 331\u2013335. The most reasonable assumption,\nthen, would seem to be that the trial court did not consider\nit, and the Court does not hold otherwise. See ante, at 20.\n   Clark\u2019s objection to this refusal by the trier of fact to\nconsider the evidence as it bore on his key defense was\nmade at all stages of the proceeding. In his post-trial\nmotion to vacate the judgment, Clark argued that \u201cprohib\niting consideration of any evidence reflecting upon a men\ntally ill criminal defendant\u2019s ability to form the necessary\nmens rea violates due process.\u201d Record, Doc. 406, p. 8.\nClark pressed the same argument in the Arizona Court of\nAppeals. See Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief in No. 1CA\u2013CR\u2013\n03\u20130851 etc., pp. 46\u201352 (hereinafter Appellant\u2019s Opening\nBrief). He also noted that the trial judge had erred in\nrefusing to consider non-expert testimony\u2014presumably\nwhat the Court would call observation evidence\u2014on\nClark\u2019s mental illness. Id., at 47\u201348. (\u201cThe trial court\ntherefore violated [Clark\u2019s] right to present a defense\nbecause [the] court refused to consider any evidence, in\ncluding the multiple testimonials of lay witnesses . . . in\ndeciding whether he could form the requisite mens rea\u201d).\nThe appeals court decided the issue on the merits, holding\nthat the trial court was correct not to consider the evi\ndence of mental illness in determining whether Clark had\nthe mens rea for first-degree murder. See App. 351\u2013353.\nIt offered no distinction at all between observation or\n6                     CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nmental-disease evidence.\n    Notwithstanding the appeals court\u2019s decision, the Court\nstates that the issue was not clearly presented to the state\ncourts. See ante, at 21\u201324. According to the Court, Clark\nonly raised an objection based on State v. Mott, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1169823\"><a href=\"/opinion/1169823/state-v-mott/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">536</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 931 P. 2d 1046 (1997) (en banc), see ante, at 21\u201324,\nand Mott\u2019s holding was limited to the exclusion of mental-\ndisease and capacity evidence, see ante, at 19. The Court\nis incorrect, and on both counts.\n    First, Clark\u2019s claim goes well beyond an objection to\nMott. In fact, he specifically attempted to distinguish Mott\nby noting that the trial court in this case refused to con\nsider all evidence of mental illness. See Record, Doc. 406,\nat 8; see also Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief 48. The Court\nnotices these arguments but criticizes Clark\u2019s counsel for\nnot being specific about the observation evidence he\nwanted the trial court to consider. See ante, at 22. There\nwas no reason, though, for Clark\u2019s counsel to believe addi\ntional specificity was required, since there was no evident\ndistinction in Arizona law between observation evidence\nand mental-disease testimony.\n    Second, Mott\u2019s holding was not restricted to mental-\ndisease evidence. The Arizona Supreme Court did not\nrefer to any distinction between observation and mental-\ndisease evidence, or lay and expert testimony. Its holding\nwas stated in broad terms: \u201cArizona does not allow evi\ndence of a defendant\u2019s mental disorder short of insanity\neither as an affirmative defense or to negate the mens rea\nelement of a crime.\u201d 187 Ariz., at 541, 931 P. 2d, at 1051;\nsee id., at 540, 931 P. 2d, at 1050 (\u201cThe legislature\u2019s decision\n. . . evidences its rejection of the use of psychological testi\nmony to challenge the mens rea element of a crime\u201d). The\nCourt attempts to divine a fact/opinion distinction in Mott\nbased on Mott\u2019s distinguishing a case, State v. Christensen,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 628 P. 2d 580 (1981) (in banc), where evidence\nabout behavioral tendencies was deemed admissible. See\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nante, at 19. Christensen, though, also addressed an expert\nopinion; the difference was that the evidence there con\ncerned a \u201ccharacter trait of acting reflexively in response to\nstress,\u201d not a mental illness. Mott, supra, at 544, 931 P. 2d,\nat 1054. Since the Court recognizes the Arizona Court of\nAppeals relied on Mott, the expansive rule of exclusion in\nMott\u2014without any suggestion of a limitation depending on\nthe kind of evidence\u2014should suffice for us to reach the so-\ncalled observation-evidence issue. Even if, as the Court\ncontends, see ante, at 15, Mott is limited to expert testi\nmony, the Court\u2019s categories still do not properly interpret\nMott, because the Court\u2019s own definition of observation\nevidence includes some expert testimony, see ante, at 17.\n   It makes no difference that in the appeals court Clark\nreferred to the issue as inability to form knowledge or\nintent. See Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief 46\u201352. He did not\ninsist on some vague, general incapacity. He stated,\ninstead, that he \u201csuffered from a major mental illness and\nwas psychotic at the time of the offense.\u201d Id., at 48. Even\nif Clark\u2019s arguments were insufficient to apprise the state\ncourt of the argument, \u201c[o]ur traditional rule is that \u2018[o]nce\na federal claim is properly presented, a party can make\nany argument in support of that claim; parties are not\nlimited to the precise arguments they made below.\u2019 \u201d\nLebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513\nU. S. 374, 379 (1995) (quoting Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S.\n519, 534 (1992)). The claim is clear. Though it seems to be\nobscure to this Court, it was understood by the Arizona\nCourt of Appeals, which stated: \u201cClark argues that the trial\ncourt erred in refusing to consider evidence of his mental\ndisease or defect in determining whether he had the req\nuisite mens rea to commit first-degree murder.\u201d App. 351.\nWhen the question is what the state court held, it is not\ninstructive for this Court to recast the words the state\ncourt used.\n   The razor-thin distinction the Court draws between\n8                    CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nevidence being used to show incapacity and evidence being\nused to show lack of mens rea directly does not identify\ntwo different claims. Clark\u2019s single claim, however char\nacterized, involves the use of the same mental-illness\nevidence to decide whether he had the requisite knowledge\nor intent. The various ways in which the evidence is\nrelevant in disproving mens rea hardly qualify as separate\nclaims. The new arguments allowed in Lebron and Yee, by\ncomparison, were far more disconnected from the initial\nbases for the alleged violations. See Lebron, supra, at 378,\n379 (for purposes of showing state action, petitioner could\nargue that Amtrak was a Government entity even though\nhe argued below only that it was a private entity with\nclose connections to Government entities, because the\nclaim was simply \u201cthat Amtrak did not accord him the\nrights it was obliged to provide by the First Amendment\u201d);\nYee, supra, at 534, 535 (petitioners could argue that an\nordinance constituted a regulatory taking, even though they\narguably asserted in the Court of Appeals only a physical\ntaking, because the claim was simply \u201cthat the ordinance\neffects an unconstitutional taking\u201d). If we give this latitude\nto litigants in civil cases, surely we must do so here. Fur\nthermore, to the extent any ambiguity remains on whether\nthe claim was raised, the proper course is to remand. See\nBradshaw v. Richey, 546 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 6)\n(per curiam). Unless the state court clearly decides an\nissue on state-law grounds, which the Court does not\ncontend occurred here, there is no bar to our review of the\nfederal question. See Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255, 261\u2013\n262 (1989).\n   Before this Court Clark framed the issue in broad terms\nthat encompass the question whether the evidence of his\nmental illness should have been considered to show he did\nnot at the time of the offense have the knowledge or intent\nto shoot a police officer. See Brief for Petitioner i (\u201cQues\ntions Presented for Review: (1) Whether Arizona\u2019s blanket\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

An entire section of Clark\u2019s\nopening brief argues that the evidence of mental illness\nshould have been considered to rebut the prosecution\u2019s\ninference of knowledge or intent from the factual circum\nstances of the crime. See Brief for Petitioner 13\u201321. This\nline of argument concerns facts of behavior and amounts\nto more than a claim of general incapacity.\n   Clark seeks resolution of issues that can be complex and\nsomewhat overlapping. In the end, however, we must\ndecide whether he had the right to introduce evidence\nshowing he lacked the intent or knowledge the statute\nitself sets forth in describing a basic element of the crime.\nClark has preserved this issue at all stages, including in\nthis Court.\n                            II\n  Clark was charged with first-degree murder for the shoot\n10                   CLARK v.

Rev.\nStat. Ann. \u00a713\u20131105(A)(3) (West Supp. 2005). Clark chal\nlenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to consider any evidence of\nmental illness, from lay or expert testimony, in determining\nwhether he acted with the knowledge or intent element of\nthe crime. See App. 9; see also Mott, 187 Ariz., at 541, 931\nP. 2d, at 1051.\n   States have substantial latitude under the Constitution\nto define rules for the exclusion of evidence and to apply\nthose rules to criminal defendants.

If the trier\nof fact were to find Clark\u2019s evidence sufficient to discount\nthe case made by the State, which has the burden to prove\nknowledge or intent as an element of the offense, Clark\nwould not be guilty of first-degree murder under Arizona\nlaw.\n   The Court attempts to diminish Clark\u2019s interest by treat\ning mental-illness evidence as concerning only \u201cjudgment,\u201d\nrather than fact. Ante, at 36. This view appears to derive\nfrom the Court\u2019s characterization of Clark\u2019s claim as rais\ning only general incapacity. See ibid. This is wrong for\nthe reasons already discussed. It fails to recognize, more\nover, the meaning of the offense element in question here.\nThe mens rea element of intent or knowledge may, at some\nlevel, comprise certain moral choices, but it rests in the\nfirst instance on a factual determination. That is the fact\nClark sought to put in issue. Either Clark knew he was\nkilling a police officer or he did not.\n   The issue is not, as the Court insists, whether Clark\u2019s\nmental illness acts as an \u201cexcuse from customary criminal\nresponsibility,\u201d ante, at 30, but whether his mental illness,\nas a factual matter, made him unaware that he was shoot\ning a police officer. If it did, Clark needs no excuse, as\nthen he did not commit the crime as Arizona defines it.\nFor the elements of first-degree murder, where the ques\ntion is knowledge of particular facts\u2014that one is killing a\npolice officer\u2014the determination depends not on moral\nresponsibility but on empirical fact. Clark\u2019s evidence of\nmental illness had a direct and substantial bearing upon\nwhat he knew, or thought he knew, to be the facts when\nhe pulled the trigger; this lay at the heart of the matter.\n   The trial court\u2019s exclusion was all the more severe be\ncause it barred from consideration on the issue of mens rea\nall this evidence, from any source, thus preventing Clark\nfrom showing he did not commit the crime as defined by\n12                   CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nArizona law. Quite apart from due process principles, we\nhave held that a bar of this sort can be inconsistent with\nthe Confrontation Clause. See Delaware v. Van Arsdall,\n475 U. S. 673 (1986). In Van Arsdall the Court held a state\ncourt erred in making a ruling that \u201cprohibited all inquiry\ninto\u201d an event. Id., at 679. At issue was a line of defense\nquestioning designed to show the bias of a prosecution\nwitness. In the instant case the ruling in question bars from\nconsideration all testimony from all witnesses necessary to\npresent the argument that was central to the whole case for\nthe defense: a challenge to the State\u2019s own proof on an\nelement of the crime. The Due Process and Compulsory\nProcess Clauses, and not the Confrontation Clause, may be\nthe controlling standard; but the disability imposed on the\naccused is every bit as substantial and pervasive here as it\nwas in Van Arsdall.\n   Arizona\u2019s rule is problematic because it excludes evi\ndence no matter how credible and material it may be in\ndisproving an element of the offense. The Court\u2019s cases\nhave noted the potential arbitrariness of per se exclusions\nand, on this rationale, have invalidated various state\nprohibitions.

If the rule does\nnot substantially burden the defense, then it is likely\npermissible. See Scheffer, 523 U. S., at 316\u2013317 (uphold\ning exclusion of polygraph evidence in part because this\nrule \u201cdoes not implicate any significant interest of the\naccused\u201d); id., at 318 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment) (\u201c[S]ome later case might present\na more compelling case for introduction of the testimony\nthan this one does\u201d). Where, however, the burden is sub\nstantial, the State must present a valid reason for its per\nse evidentiary rule.\n   In the instant case Arizona\u2019s proposed reasons are insuf\nficient to support its categorical exclusion. While the\nState contends that testimony regarding mental illness\nmay be too incredible or speculative for the jury to con\nsider, this does not explain why the exclusion applies in all\ncases to all evidence of mental illness. \u201cA State\u2019s legiti\nmate interest in barring unreliable evidence does not\nextend to per se exclusions that may be reliable in an\nindividual case.\u201d Rock, 483 U. S., at 61. States have\ncertain discretion to bar unreliable or speculative testi\nmony and to adopt rules to ensure the reliability of expert\ntestimony. Arizona has done so, and there is no reason to\nbelieve its rules are insufficient to avoid speculative evi\ndence of mental illness. See Ariz. Rules of Evid. 403, 702\n(West 2005). This is particularly true because Arizona\napplies its usual case-by-case approach to permit admis\nsion of evidence of mental illness for a variety of other\npurposes. See, e.g., State v.

ARIZONA\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ntestimony regarding neurological deficits).\n   The risk of jury confusion also fails to justify the rule.\nThe State defends its rule as a means to avoid the com\nplexities of determining how and to what degree a mental\nillness affects a person\u2019s mental state. The difficulty of\nresolving a factual issue, though, does not present a suffi\ncient reason to take evidence away from the jury even\nwhen it is crucial for the defense. \u201cWe have always\ntrusted juries to sort through complex facts in various\nareas of law.\u201d United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 289\n(2005) (STEVENS, J., dissenting in part). Even were the risk\nof jury confusion real enough to justify excluding evidence in\nmost cases, this would provide little basis for prohibiting all\nevidence of mental illness without any inquiry into its likely\neffect on the jury or its role in deciding the linchpin issue of\nknowledge and intent. Indeed, Arizona has a rule in place\nto serve this very purpose. See Ariz. Rule of Evid. 403.\n   Even assuming the reliability and jury-confusion justifi\ncations were persuasive in some cases, they would not\nsuffice here. It does not overcome the constitutional objec\ntion to say that an evidentiary rule that is reasonable on\nits face can be applied as well to bar significant defense\nevidence without any rational basis for doing so. In Van\nArsdall, for example, the Court rejected the application of\nDelaware Rule of Evidence 403, which allows relevant\nevidence to be excluded where its probative value is sub\nstantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice or other\nharms to the trial process. 475 U. S., at 676, and n. 2.\nWhile the Rule is well established and designed for a legiti\nmate function, the Constitution prevented an application\nthat deprived the defendant of all inquiry into an important\nissue. Id., at 679. Other cases have applied this same case-\nspecific analysis in deciding the legitimacy of an exclusion.\nSee, e.g., Rock, supra, at 62 (the \u201ccircumstances present an\nargument for admissibility of petitioner\u2019s testimony in this\nparticular case, an argument that must be considered by the\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           15\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ntrial court\u201d); Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U. S. 284, 302\n(1973) (\u201cIn these circumstances, where constitutional rights\ndirectly affecting the ascertainment of guilt are implicated,\nthe hearsay rule may not be applied mechanistically\nto defeat the ends of justice\u201d); cf. Scheffer, 523 U. S., at\n318 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment).\n   The Court undertakes little analysis of the interests\nparticular to this case. By proceeding in this way it de\nvalues Clark\u2019s constitutional rights. The reliability ra\ntionale has minimal applicability here. The Court is\ncorrect that many mental diseases are difficult to define\nand the subject of great debate. See ante, at 33\u201334.\nSchizophrenia, however, is a well-documented mental\nillness, and no one seriously disputes either its definition\nor its most prominent clinical manifestations. The State\u2019s\nown expert conceded that Clark had paranoid schizophre\nnia and was actively psychotic at the time of the killing.\nSee App. 254\u2013257. The jury-confusion rationale, if it is at\nall applicable here, is the result of the Court\u2019s own insis\ntence on conflating the insanity defense and the question\nof intent. Considered on its own terms, the issue of intent\nand knowledge is a straightforward factual question. A\ntrier of fact is quite capable of weighing defense testimony\nand then determining whether the accused did or did not\nintend to kill or knowingly kill a human being who was a\npolice officer. True, the issue can be difficult to decide in\nparticular instances, but no more so than many matters\njuries must confront.\n   The Court says mental-illness evidence \u201ccan easily\nmislead,\u201d ante, at 36, and may \u201ctel[l] us little or nothing\nabout the ability of the defendant to form mens rea,\u201d ante,\nat 35. These generalities do not, however, show how\nrelevant or misleading the evidence in this case would be\n(or explain why Arizona Rule of Evidence 403 is insuffi\ncient for weighing these factors). As explained above, the\n16                   CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nevidence of Clark\u2019s mental illness bears directly on mens\nrea, for it suggests Clark may not have known he was\nkilling a human being. It is striking that while the Court\ndiscusses at length the likelihood of misjudgment from\nplacing too much emphasis on evidence of mental illness,\nsee ante, at 33\u201338, it ignores the risk of misjudging an\ninnocent man guilty from refusing to consider this highly\nrelevant evidence at all. Clark\u2019s expert, it is true, said no\none could know exactly what was on Clark\u2019s mind at the\ntime of the shooting. See ante, at 37. The expert testified\nextensively, however, about the effect of Clark\u2019s delusions\non his perceptions of the world around him, and about\nwhether Clark\u2019s behavior around the time of the shooting\nwas consistent with delusional thinking. This testimony\nwas relevant to determining whether Clark knew he was\nkilling a human being. It also bolstered the testimony of\nlay witnesses, none of which was deemed unreliable or\nmisleading by the state courts.\n   For the same reasons, the Court errs in seeking support\nfrom the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s statement\nthat a psychiatrist may be justifiably reluctant to reach\nlegal conclusions regarding the defendant\u2019s mental state.\nSee ante, at 37. In this very case, the American Psychiat\nric Association made clear that psychiatric evidence plays\na crucial role regardless of whether the psychiatrist testi\nfies on the ultimate issue: \u201cExpert evidence of mental\ndisorders, presented by qualified professionals and subject\nto adversarial testing, is both relevant to the mental-state\nissues raised by mens rea requirements and reliable. . . .\nSuch evidence could not be condemned wholesale without\nunsettling the legal system\u2019s central reliance on such\nevidence.\u201d Brief for American Psychiatric Association\net al. as Amici Curiae 15.\n   Contrary to the Court\u2019s suggestion, see ante, at 35\u201336,\nthe fact that the state and defense experts drew different\nconclusions about the effect of Clark\u2019s mental illness on\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           17\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nhis mental state only made Clark\u2019s evidence contested; it\ndid not make the evidence irrelevant or misleading. The\ntrial court was capable of evaluating the competing con\nclusions, as factfinders do in countless cases where there\nis a dispute among witnesses. In fact, the potential to\nmislead will be far greater under the Court\u2019s new eviden\ntiary system, where jurors will receive observation evi\ndence without the necessary explanation from experts.\n   The fact that mental-illness evidence may be considered\nin deciding criminal responsibility does not compensate for\nits exclusion from consideration on the mens rea elements\nof the crime. Cf. ante, at 33. The evidence addresses\ndifferent issues in the two instances. Criminal responsi\nbility involves an inquiry into whether the defendant\nknew right from wrong, not whether he had the mens rea\nelements of the offense. While there may be overlap be\ntween the two issues, \u201cthe existence or nonexistence of\nlegal insanity bears no necessary relationship to the exis\ntence or nonexistence of the required mental elements of\nthe crime.\u201d Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 706 (1975)\n(Rehnquist, J., concurring).\n   Even if the analyses were equivalent, there is a different\nburden of proof for insanity than there is for mens rea.\nArizona requires the defendant to prove his insanity by\nclear and convincing evidence. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a713\u2013502(C) (West 2001). The prosecution, however, must\nprove all elements of the offense beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. See Mullaney, supra, at 703\u2013704; In re Winship,\n397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970). The shift in the burden on the\ncriminal responsibility issue, while permissible under our\nprecedent, see Leland v. Oregon, 343 U. S. 790 (1952),\ncannot be applied to the question of intent or knowledge\nwithout relieving the State of its responsibility to establish\nthis element of the offense. See Sandstrom v. Montana, 442\nU. S. 510, 524 (1979) (jury instruction that had the effect of\nplacing the burden on the defendant to disprove that he had\n18                    CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nthe requisite mental state violates due process). While\nevidentiary rules do not generally shift the burden\nimpermissibly, where there is a right to have evidence\nconsidered on an element of the offense, the right is not\nrespected by allowing the evidence to come in only on an\nissue for which the defendant bears the burden of proof.\nSee Cool v. United States, 409 U. S. 100, 103 (1972) (per\ncuriam) (jury instruction that allowed jury to consider\naccomplice\u2019s testimony only if it was true beyond a rea\nsonable doubt \u201cplaces an improper burden on the defense\nand allows the jury to convict despite its failure to find\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d); Martin v. Ohio, 480\nU. S. 228, 233\u2013234 (1987) (State can shift the burden on a\nclaim of self-defense, but if the jury were disallowed from\nconsidering self-defense evidence for purposes of deciding\nthe elements of the offense, it \u201cwould relieve the State of its\nburden and plainly run afoul of Winship\u2019s mandate\u201d). By\nviewing the Arizona rule as creating merely a \u201cpresump\ntion of sanity (or capacity or responsibility),\u201d ante, at 30,\nrather than a presumption that the mens rea elements\nwere not affected by mental illness, the Court fails to\nappreciate the implications for Winship.\n   The State attempts to sidestep the evidentiary issue\nentirely by claiming that its mental-illness exclusion\nsimply alters one element of the crime. The evidentiary\nrule at issue here, however, cannot be considered a valid\nredefinition of the offense. Under the State\u2019s logic, a\nperson would be guilty of first-degree murder if he know\ningly or intentionally killed a police officer or committed\nthe killing under circumstances that would show knowl\nedge or intent but for the defendant\u2019s mental illness. To\nbegin with, Arizona law does not say this. And if it did, it\nwould be impermissible. States have substantial discretion\nin defining criminal offenses. In some instances they may\nprovide that the accused has the burden of persuasion\nwith respect to affirmative defenses. See Patterson v. New\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          19\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nYork, 432 U. S. 197, 210 (1977). \u201cBut there are obviously\nconstitutional limits beyond which the States may not go\nin this regard.\u201d Ibid. If it were otherwise, States could\nlabel all evidentiary exclusions as redefinitions and so\nevade constitutional requirements. There is no rational\nbasis, furthermore, for criminally punishing a person who\ncommits a killing without knowledge or intent only if that\nperson has a mental illness. Cf. Robinson v. California,\n370 U. S. 660, 666 (1962). The State attempts to bring the\ninstant case within the ambit of Montana v. Egelhoff, 518\nU. S. 37 (1996); but in Egelhoff the excluded evidence con\ncerned voluntary intoxication, for which a person can be\nheld responsible. Viewed either as an evidentiary rule or a\nredefinition of the offense, it was upheld because it \u201ccom\nports with and implements society\u2019s moral perception that\none who has voluntarily impaired his own faculties should\nbe responsible for the consequences.\u201d Id., at 50 (plurality\nopinion). An involuntary mental illness does not implicate\nthis justification.\n   Future dangerousness is not, as the Court appears to\nconclude, see ante, at 38\u201339, n. 45, a rational basis for\nconvicting mentally ill individuals of crimes they did not\ncommit. Civil commitment proceedings can ensure that\nindividuals who present a danger to themselves or others\nreceive proper treatment without unfairly treating them\nas criminals. The State presents no evidence to the con\ntrary, and the Court ought not to imply otherwise.\n   The State gains little support from Fisher v. United\nStates, 328 U. S. 463 (1946). There the defendant re\nquested an instruction from the trial court that the jury\nconsider his mental deficiencies in determining his capac\nity for premeditation and deliberation. Id., at 470. The\nCourt noted that \u201c[i]n view of the status of the defense of\npartial responsibility in the District and the nation no\ncontention is or could be made of the denial of due proc\ness.\u201d Id., at 466. This dictum may be attributable to the\n20                    CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nfact that the cases recognizing a defendant\u2019s evidentiary\nrights and the prosecution\u2019s duty to prove all elements\nbeyond a reasonable doubt were still decades away. It\nmay also reflect the fact that the jury instructions as given\ndid seem to allow the jury to consider evidence of mental\ndeficiency if it disproved the elements of the offense. See\nid., at 467, n. 3 (The jury instructions stated, \u201c \u2018It is further\ncontended that even if sane and responsible, there was no\ndeliberate intent to kill, nor in fact any actual intent to\nkill. Therefore if not guilty by reason of insanity, the\ndefendant at most is guilty only of second degree murder\nor manslaughter\u2019 \u201d). Even further ambiguity comes from\nthe fact that the defense in Fisher concerned a claim that\nthe petitioner was \u201cmentally somewhat below the average\u201d\nwith a \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d of aggression. Id., at\n467. This general claim of mental deficiencies was rele\nvant to the \u201ctheory of partial responsibility,\u201d id., at 470, he\nwanted the jury to consider. Unlike the mental illness\nhere, though, which concerns inadequacy of perception\nand information processing, the petitioner\u2019s claim may not\nhave been relevant to mens rea unless mens rea were\nredefined to include an element of responsibility. Fisher\u2019s\nlanguage, then, does not control this case.\n   While Arizona\u2019s rule is not unique, either historically or\nin contemporary practice, this fact does not dispose of\nClark\u2019s constitutional argument. To the extent Fisher\nmay have suggested the contrary, subsequent cases make\nclear that while the existence of the rule in some jurisdic\ntions is a significant factor to consider, see Egelhoff, supra,\nat 43 (plurality opinion), it is not dispositive for evaluation\nof a claim that the accused was foreclosed from introduc\ning evidence crucial to the defense. The evidentiary exclu\nsion of accomplice testimony the Court invalidated in\nWashington was, in fact, well established. See 388 U. S.,\nat 21\u201322. The exclusion of hypnotically refreshed testi\nmony likewise had some support when the Court held it\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           21\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nunconstitutional as applied to a defendant\u2019s own testi\nmony. Rock, 483 U. S., at 57. While 13 States still impose\nsignificant restrictions on the use of mental-illness evi\ndence to negate mens rea, a substantial majority of the\nStates currently allow it. Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 22\u201323, and n. 13. The fact that a reason\nable number of States restrict this evidence weighs into\nthe analysis, but applying the rule as a per se bar, as\nArizona does, is so plainly unreasonable that it cannot be\nsustained.\n   Putting aside the lack of any legitimate state interest\nfor application of the rule in this case, its irrationality is\napparent when considering the evidence that is allowed.\nSee Washington, supra, at 22 (\u201cThe absurdity of the rule is\namply demonstrated by the exceptions that have been\nmade to it\u201d). Arizona permits the defendant to introduce,\nfor example, evidence of \u201cbehavioral tendencies\u201d to show\nhe did not have the required mental state. See Mott, 187\nAriz., at 544, 931 P. 2d, at 1054; Christensen, 129 Ariz., at\n35\u201336, 628 P. 2d, at 583\u2013584. While defining mental\nillness is a difficult matter, the State seems to exclude the\nevidence one would think most reliable by allowing unex\nplained and uncategorized tendencies to be introduced\nwhile excluding relatively well-understood psychiatric\ntestimony regarding well-documented mental illnesses. It\nis unclear, moreover, what would have happened in this\ncase had the defendant wanted to testify that he thought\nOfficer Moritz was an alien. If disallowed, it would be\ntantamount to barring Clark from testifying on his behalf\nto explain his own actions. If allowed, then Arizona\u2019s rule\nwould simply prohibit the corroboration necessary to make\nsense of Clark\u2019s explanation. In sum, the rule forces the\njury to decide guilt in a fictional world with undefined and\nunexplained behaviors but without mental illness. This\nrule has no rational justification and imposes a significant\nburden upon a straightforward defense: He did not commit\n22                  CLARK v. ARIZONA\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nthe crime with which he was charged.\n  These are the reasons for my respectful dissent.\n</pre>",
