Argued March 28, 2006\u2014Decided June 29, 2006\nPursuant to Congress\u2019 Joint Resolution authorizing the President to\n  \u201cuse all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, or\n  ganizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, commit\n  ted or aided\u201d the September 11, 2001, al Qaeda terrorist attacks\n  (AUMF), U. S. Armed Forces invaded Afghanistan. During the hos\n  tilities, in 2001, militia forces captured petitioner Hamdan, a Yemeni\n  national, and turned him over to the U. S. military, which, in 2002,\n  transported him to prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Over a year\n  later, the President deemed Hamdan eligible for trial by military\n  commission for then-unspecified crimes. After another year, he was\n  charged with conspiracy \u201cto commit . . . offenses triable by military\n  commission.\u201d In habeas and mandamus petitions, Hamdan asserted\n  that the military commission lacks authority to try him because (1)\n  neither congressional Act nor the common law of war supports trial\n  by this commission for conspiracy, an offense that, Hamdan says, is\n  not a violation of the law of war; and (2) the procedures adopted to\n  try him violate basic tenets of military and international law, includ\n  ing the principle that a defendant must be permitted to see and hear\n  the evidence against him.\n     The District Court granted habeas relief and stayed the commis\n  sion\u2019s proceedings, concluding that the President\u2019s authority to estab\n  lish military commissions extends only to offenders or offenses triable\n  by such a commission under the law of war; that such law includes\n  the Third Geneva Convention; that Hamdan is entitled to that Con\n  vention\u2019s full protections until adjudged, under it, not to be a prisoner\n  of war; and that, whether or not Hamdan is properly classified a pris\n  oner of war, the commission convened to try him was established in\n2                        HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    violation of both the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10\n    U. S. C. \u00a7801 et seq., and Common Article 3 of the Third Geneva Con\n    vention because it had the power to convict based on evidence the ac\n    cused would never see or hear. The D. C. Circuit reversed. Although\n    it declined the Government\u2019s invitation to abstain from considering\n    Hamdan\u2019s challenge, cf. Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 U. S. 738, the\n    appeals court ruled, on the merits, that Hamdan was not entitled to re\n    lief because the Geneva Conventions are not judicially enforceable. The\n    court also concluded that Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1, foreclosed any\n    separation-of-powers objection to the military commission\u2019s jurisdiction,\n    and that Hamdan\u2019s trial before the commission would violate neither\n    the UCMJ nor Armed Forces regulations implementing the Geneva\n    Conventions.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n415 F. 3d 33, reversed and remanded.\n     JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to\n  Parts V and VI\u2013D\u2013iv, concluding:\n     1. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss, based on the Detainee\n  Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), is denied. DTA \u00a71005(e)(1) provides\n  that \u201cno court . . . shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider . . . an\n  application for . . . habeas corpus filed by . . . an alien detained . . . at\n  Guantanamo Bay.\u201d Section 1005(h)(2) provides that \u00a7\u00a71005(e)(2) and\n  (3)\u2014which give the D. C. Circuit \u201cexclusive\u201d jurisdiction to review the\n  final decisions of, respectively, combatant status review tribunals\n  and military commissions\u2014\u201cshall apply with respect to any claim\n  whose review is . . . pending on\u201d the DTA\u2019s effective date, as was\n  Hamdan\u2019s case. The Government\u2019s argument that \u00a7\u00a71005(e)(1) and\n  (h) repeal this Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the decision below is re\n  butted by ordinary principles of statutory construction. A negative\n  inference may be drawn from Congress\u2019 failure to include \u00a71005(e)(1)\n  within the scope of \u00a71005(h)(2). Cf., e.g., Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S.\n  320, 330. \u201cIf . . . Congress was reasonably concerned to ensure that\n  [\u00a7\u00a71005(e)(2) and (3)] be applied to pending cases, it should have been\n  just as concerned about [\u00a71005(e)(1)], unless it had the different in\n  tent that the latter [section] not be applied to the general run of\n  pending cases.\u201d Id., at 329. If anything, the evidence of deliberate\n  omission is stronger here than it was in Lindh. The legislative his\n  tory shows that Congress not only considered the respective temporal\n  reaches of \u00a7\u00a71005(e)(1), (2), and (3) together at every stage, but omit\n  ted paragraph (1) from its directive only after having rejected earlier\n  proposed versions of the statute that would have included what is\n  now paragraph (1) within that directive\u2019s scope. Congress\u2019 rejection\n  of the very language that would have achieved the result the Gov\n  ernment urges weighs heavily against the Government\u2019s interpreta\n                   Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ntion. See Doe v. Chao, 540 U. S. 614, 621\u2013623. Pp. 7\u201320.\n   2. The Government argues unpersuasively that abstention is ap\npropriate under Councilman, which concluded that, as a matter of\ncomity, federal courts should normally abstain from intervening in\npending courts-martial against service members, see 420 U. S., at\n740. Neither of the comity considerations Councilman identified\nweighs in favor of abstention here. First, the assertion that military\ndiscipline and, therefore, the Armed Forces\u2019 efficient operation, are\nbest served if the military justice system acts without regular inter\nference from civilian courts, see id., at 752, is inapt because Hamdan\nis not a service member. Second, the view that federal courts should\nrespect the balance Congress struck when it created \u201can integrated\nsystem of military courts and review procedures\u201d is inapposite, since\nthe tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of that integrated\nsystem. Rather than Councilman, the most relevant precedent is Ex\nparte Quirin, where the Court, far from abstaining pending the con\nclusion of ongoing military proceedings, expedited its review because\nof (1) the public importance of the questions raised, (2) the Court\u2019s\nduty, in both peace and war, to preserve the constitutional safe\nguards of civil liberty, and (3) the public interest in a decision on\nthose questions without delay, 317 U. S, at 19. The Government has\nidentified no countervailing interest that would permit federal courts\nto depart from their general duty to exercise the jurisdiction Con\ngress has conferred on them. Pp. 20\u201325.\n   3. The military commission at issue is not expressly authorized by\nany congressional Act. Quirin held that Congress had, through Arti\ncle of War 15, sanctioned the use of military commissions to try of\nfenders or offenses against the law of war. 317 U. S., at 28. UCMJ\nArt. 21, which is substantially identical to the old Art. 15, reads: \u201cThe\njurisdiction [of] courts-martial shall not be construed as depriving\nmilitary commissions . . . of concurrent jurisdiction in respect of of\nfenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried\nby such . . . commissions.\u201d 10 U. S. C. \u00a7821. Contrary to the Gov\nernment\u2019s assertion, even Quirin did not view that authorization as a\nsweeping mandate for the President to invoke military commissions\nwhenever he deems them necessary. Rather, Quirin recognized that\nCongress had simply preserved what power, under the Constitution\nand the common law of war, the President already had to convene\nmilitary commissions\u2014with the express condition that he and those\nunder his command comply with the law of war. See 317 U. S., at\n28\u201329. Neither the AUMF nor the DTA can be read to provide spe\ncific, overriding authorization for the commission convened to try\nHamdan. Assuming the AUMF activated the President\u2019s war powers,\nsee Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, and that those powers include\n4                         HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    authority to convene military commissions in appropriate circum\n    stances, see, e.g., id., at 518, there is nothing in the AUMF\u2019s text or leg\n    islative history even hinting that Congress intended to expand or alter\n    the authorization set forth in UCMJ Art. 21. Cf. Ex parte Yerger, 8\n    Wall. 85, 105. Likewise, the DTA cannot be read to authorize this\n    commission. Although the DTA, unlike either Art. 21 or the AUMF,\n    was enacted after the President convened Hamdan\u2019s commission, it\n    contains no language authorizing that tribunal or any other at Guan\n    tanamo Bay. Together, the UCMJ, the AUMF, and the DTA at most\n    acknowledge a general Presidential authority to convene military\n    commissions in circumstances where justified under the Constitution\n    and laws, including the law of war. Absent a more specific congres\n    sional authorization, this Court\u2019s task is, as it was in Quirin, to de\n    cide whether Hamdan\u2019s military commission is so justified. Pp. 25\u2013\n    30.\n       4. The military commission at issue lacks the power to proceed be\n    cause its structure and procedures violate both the UCMJ and the\n    four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949. Pp. 49\u201372.\n          (a) The commission\u2019s procedures, set forth in Commission Order\n    No. 1, provide, among other things, that an accused and his civilian\n    counsel may be excluded from, and precluded from ever learning\n    what evidence was presented during, any part of the proceeding the\n    official who appointed the commission or the presiding officer decides\n    to \u201cclose.\u201d Grounds for closure include the protection of classified in\n    formation, the physical safety of participants and witnesses, the pro\n    tection of intelligence and law enforcement sources, methods, or ac\n    tivities, and \u201cother national security interests.\u201d Appointed military\n    defense counsel must be privy to these closed sessions, but may, at\n    the presiding officer\u2019s discretion, be forbidden to reveal to the client\n    what took place therein. Another striking feature is that the rules\n    governing Hamdan\u2019s commission permit the admission of any evi\n    dence that, in the presiding officer\u2019s opinion, would have probative\n    value to a reasonable person. Moreover, the accused and his civilian\n    counsel may be denied access to classified and other \u201cprotected in\n    formation,\u201d so long as the presiding officer concludes that the evi\n    dence is \u201cprobative\u201d and that its admission without the accused\u2019s\n    knowledge would not result in the denial of a full and fair trial. Pp.\n    49\u201352.\n          (b) The Government objects to this Court\u2019s consideration of a pro\n    cedural challenge at this stage on the grounds, inter alia, that Ham\n    dan will be able to raise such a challenge following a final decision\n    under the DTA, and that there is no basis to presume, before the trial\n    has even commenced, that it will not be conducted in good faith and\n    according to law. These contentions are unsound. First, because\n                   Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                      5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nHamdan apparently is not subject to the death penalty (at least as\nmatters now stand) and may receive a prison sentence shorter than\n10 years, he has no automatic right to federal-court review of the\ncommission\u2019s \u201cfinal decision\u201d under DTA \u00a71005(e)(3). Second, there is\na basis to presume that the procedures employed during Hamdan\u2019s\ntrial will violate the law: He will be, and indeed already has been, ex\ncluded from his own trial. Thus, review of the procedures in advance\nof a \u201cfinal decision\u201d is appropriate. Pp. 52\u201353.\n     (c) Because UCMJ Article 36 has not been complied with here,\nthe rules specified for Hamdan\u2019s commission trial are illegal. The\nprocedures governing such trials historically have been the same as\nthose governing courts-martial. Although this uniformity principle is\nnot inflexible and does not preclude all departures from courts-\nmartial procedures, any such departure must be tailored to the exi\ngency that necessitates it. That understanding is reflected in Art.\n36(b), which provides that the procedural rules the President prom\nulgates for courts-martial and military commissions alike must be\n\u201cuniform insofar as practicable,\u201d 10 U. S. C. \u00a7836(b). The \u201cpractica\nbility\u201d determination the President has made is insufficient to justify\nvariances from the procedures governing courts-martial. The Presi\ndent here has determined, pursuant to the requirement of Art. 36(a),\nthat it is impracticable to apply the rules and principles of law that\ngovern \u201cthe trial of criminal cases in the United States district\ncourts\u201d to Hamdan\u2019s commission. The President has not, however,\nmade a similar official determination that it is impracticable to apply\nthe rules for courts-martial. And even if subsection (b)\u2019s require\nments could be satisfied without an official practicability determina\ntion, that subsection\u2019s requirements are not satisfied here. Nothing\nin the record demonstrates that it would be impracticable to apply\ncourt-martial rules here. There is no suggestion, e.g., of any logistical\ndifficulty in securing properly sworn and authenticated evidence or in\napplying the usual principles of relevance and admissibility. It is not\nevident why the danger posed by international terrorism, consider\nable though it is, should require, in the case of Hamdan\u2019s trial, any\nvariance from the courts-martial rules. The absence of any showing\nof impracticability is particularly disturbing when considered in light\nof the clear and admitted failure to apply one of the most fundamen\ntal protections afforded not just by the Manual for Courts-Martial but\nalso by the UCMJ itself: The right to be present. See 10 U. S. C. A.\n\u00a7839(c). Because the jettisoning of so basic a right cannot lightly be\nexcused as \u201cpracticable,\u201d the courts-martial rules must apply. Since\nit is undisputed that Commission Order No. 1 deviates in many sig\nnificant respects from those rules, it necessarily violates Art. 36(b).\nPp. 53\u201362.\n6                        HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n          (d) The procedures adopted to try Hamdan also violate the Ge\n    neva Conventions. The D. C. Circuit dismissed Hamdan\u2019s challenge\n    in this regard on the grounds, inter alia, that the Conventions are not\n    judicially enforceable and that, in any event, Hamdan is not entitled\n    to their protections. Neither of these grounds is persuasive. Pp. 62\u2013\n    68.\n             (i) The appeals court relied on a statement in Johnson v. Eisen\n    trager, 339 U. S. 763, 789, n. 14, suggesting that this Court lacked\n    power even to consider the merits of a Convention argument because\n    the political and military authorities had sole responsibility for ob\n    serving and enforcing prisoners\u2019 rights under the Convention. How\n    ever, Eisentrager does not control here because, regardless of the na\n    ture of the rights conferred on Hamdan, cf. United States v. Rauscher,\n    119 U. S. 407, they are indisputably part of the law of war, see\n    Hamdi, 542 U. S., at 520\u2013521, compliance with which is the condition\n    upon which UCMJ Art. 21 authority is granted. Pp. 63\u201365.\n             (ii) Alternatively, the appeals court agreed with the Govern\n    ment that the Conventions do not apply because Hamdan was cap\n    tured during the war with al Qaeda, which is not a Convention signa\n    tory, and that conflict is distinct from the war with signatory\n    Afghanistan. The Court need not decide the merits of this argument\n    because there is at least one provision of the Geneva Conventions\n    that applies here even if the relevant conflict is not between signato\n    ries. Common Article 3, which appears in all four Conventions, pro\n    vides that, in a \u201cconflict not of an international character occurring in\n    the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties [i.e., signatories],\n    each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum,\u201d\n    certain provisions protecting \u201c[p]ersons . . . placed hors de combat by\n    . . . detention,\u201d including a prohibition on \u201cthe passing of sentences\n    . . . without previous judgment . . . by a regularly constituted court af\n    fording all the judicial guarantees . . . recognized as indispensable by\n    civilized peoples.\u201d The D. C. Circuit ruled Common Article 3 inappli\n    cable to Hamdan because the conflict with al Qaeda is international\n    in scope and thus not a \u201cconflict not of an international character. \u201d\n    That reasoning is erroneous. That the quoted phrase bears its literal\n    meaning and is used here in contradistinction to a conflict between\n    nations is demonstrated by Common Article 2, which limits its own\n    application to any armed conflict between signatories and provides\n    that signatories must abide by all terms of the Conventions even if\n    another party to the conflict is a nonsignatory, so long as the nonsig\n    natory \u201caccepts and applies\u201d those terms. Common Article 3, by con\n    trast, affords some minimal protection, falling short of full protection\n    under the Conventions, to individuals associated with neither a sig\n    natory nor even a nonsignatory who are involved in a conflict \u201cin the\n                   Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                      7\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nterritory of\u201d a signatory. The latter kind of conflict does not involve a\nclash between nations (whether signatories or not). Pp. 65\u201368.\n        (iii) While Common Article 3 does not define its \u201cregularly con\nstituted court\u201d phrase, other sources define the words to mean an\n\u201cordinary military cour[t]\u201d that is \u201cestablished and organized in ac\ncordance with the laws and procedures already in force in a country.\u201d\nThe regular military courts in our system are the courts-martial es\ntablished by congressional statute. At a minimum, a military com\nmission can be \u201cregularly constituted\u201d only if some practical need ex\nplains deviations from court-martial practice. No such need has been\ndemonstrated here. Pp. 69\u201370.\n        (iv) Common Article 3\u2019s requirements are general, crafted to\naccommodate a wide variety of legal systems, but they are require\nments nonetheless. The commission convened to try Hamdan does\nnot meet those requirements. P. 72.\n      (d) Even assuming that Hamden is a dangerous individual who\nwould cause great harm or death to innocent civilians given the op\nportunity, the Executive nevertheless must comply with the prevail\ning rule of law in undertaking to try him and subject him to criminal\npunishment. P. 72.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by JUSTICE SOUTER, JUSTICE GINSBURG,\nand JUSTICE BREYER, concluded in Parts V and VI\u2013D\u2013iv:\n   1. The Government has not charged Hamdan with an \u201coffense . . .\nthat by the law of war may be tried by military commission,\u201d 10\nU. S. C. \u00a7821. Of the three sorts of military commissions used his\ntorically, the law-of-war type used in Quirin and other cases is the\nonly model available to try Hamdan. Among the preconditions, in\ncorporated in Article of War 15 and, later, UCMJ Art. 21, for such a\ntribunal\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction are, inter alia, that it must be lim\nited to trying offenses committed within the convening commander\u2019s\nfield of command, i.e., within the theater of war, and that the offense\ncharged must have been committed during, not before or after, the\nwar. Here, Hamdan is not alleged to have committed any overt act in\na theater of war or on any specified date after September 11, 2001.\nMore importantly, the offense alleged is not triable by law-of-war\nmilitary commission. Although the common law of war may render\ntriable by military commission certain offenses not defined by stat\nute, Quirin, 317 U. S., at 30, the precedent for doing so with respect\nto a particular offense must be plain and unambiguous, cf., e.g., Lov\ning v. United States, 517 U. S. 748, 771. That burden is far from satis\nfied here. The crime of \u201cconspiracy\u201d has rarely if ever been tried as\nsuch in this country by any law-of-war military commission not exer\ncising some other form of jurisdiction, and does not appear in either\nthe Geneva Conventions or the Hague Conventions\u2014the major trea\n8                        HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ties on the law of war. Moreover, that conspiracy is not a recognized\n    violation of the law of war is confirmed by other international\n    sources, including, e.g., the International Military Tribunal at Nur\n    emberg, which pointedly refused to recognize conspiracy to commit\n    war crimes as such a violation. Because the conspiracy charge does\n    not support the commission\u2019s jurisdiction, the commission lacks au\n    thority to try Hamdan. Pp. 30\u201349.\n       2.

The procedures adopted to try Hamdan deviate from those gov\n    erning courts-martial in ways not justified by practical need, and\n    thus fail to afford the requisite guarantees.

DONALD\n  H. RUMSFELD, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 29, 2006] \n\n\n  JUSTICE STEVENS announced the judgment of the Court\nand delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\nParts I through IV, Parts VI through VI\u2013D\u2013iii, Part VI\u2013D\u2013\nv, and Part VII, and an opinion with respect to Parts V\nand VI\u2013D\u2013iv, in which JUSTICE SOUTER, JUSTICE\nGINSBURG, and JUSTICE BREYER join.\n  Petitioner Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni national, is\nin custody at an American prison in Guantanamo Bay,\nCuba. In November 2001, during hostilities between the\nUnited States and the Taliban (which then governed\nAfghanistan), Hamdan was captured by militia forces and\nturned over to the U. S. military. In June 2002, he was\ntransported to Guantanamo Bay. Over a year later, the\nPresident deemed him eligible for trial by military com\nmission for then-unspecified crimes. After another year\nhad passed, Hamdan was charged with one count of con\nspiracy \u201cto commit . . . offenses triable by military com\nmission.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a.\n  Hamdan filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus and\nmandamus to challenge the Executive Branch\u2019s intended\nmeans of prosecuting this charge. He concedes that a\n2                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt-martial constituted in accordance with the Uniform\nCode of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S. C. \u00a7801 et seq.\n(2000 ed. and Supp. III), would have authority to try him.\nHis objection is that the military commission the Presi\ndent has convened lacks such authority, for two principal\nreasons: First, neither congressional Act nor the common\nlaw of war supports trial by this commission for the crime\nof conspiracy\u2014an offense that, Hamdan says, is not a\nviolation of the law of war. Second, Hamdan contends, the\nprocedures that the President has adopted to try him\nviolate the most basic tenets of military and international\nlaw, including the principle that a defendant must be\npermitted to see and hear the evidence against him.\n  The District Court granted Hamdan\u2019s request for a writ\nof habeas corpus. 344 F. Supp. 2d 152 (DC 2004). The\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\nreversed. 415 F. 3d 33 (2005). Recognizing, as we did over\na half-century ago, that trial by military commission is an\nextraordinary measure raising important questions about\nthe balance of powers in our constitutional structure,\nEx parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1, 19 (1942), we granted certio\nrari. 546 U. S. ___ (2005).\n  For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the mili\ntary commission convened to try Hamdan lacks power to\nproceed because its structure and procedures violate both\nthe UCMJ and the Geneva Conventions. Four of us also\nconclude, see Part V, infra, that the offense with which\nHamdan has been charged is not an \u201coffens[e] that by . . .\nthe law of war may be tried by military commissions.\u201d 10\nU. S. C. \u00a7821.\n                            I\n   On September 11, 2001, agents of the al Qaeda terrorist\norganization hijacked commercial airplanes and attacked\nthe World Trade Center in New York City and the na\ntional headquarters of the Department of Defense in\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nArlington, Virginia. Americans will never forget the dev\nastation wrought by these acts. Nearly 3,000 civilians\nwere killed.\n   Congress responded by adopting a Joint Resolution\nauthorizing the President to \u201cuse all necessary and appro\npriate force against those nations, organizations, or per\nsons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or\naided the terrorist attacks . . . in order to prevent any\nfuture acts of international terrorism against the United\nStates by such nations, organizations or persons.\u201d Au\nthorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), 115 Stat.\n224, note following 50 U. S. C. \u00a71541 (2000 ed., Supp. III).\nActing pursuant to the AUMF, and having determined\nthat the Taliban regime had supported al Qaeda, the\nPresident ordered the Armed Forces of the United States\nto invade Afghanistan. In the ensuing hostilities, hun\ndreds of individuals, Hamdan among them, were captured\nand eventually detained at Guantanamo Bay.\n   On November 13, 2001, while the United States was\nstill engaged in active combat with the Taliban, the Presi\ndent issued a comprehensive military order intended to\ngovern the \u201cDetention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain\nNon-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism,\u201d 66 Fed. Reg.\n57833 (hereinafter November 13 Order or Order). Those\nsubject to the November 13 Order include any noncitizen\nfor whom the President determines \u201cthere is reason to\nbelieve\u201d that he or she (1) \u201cis or was\u201d a member of al\nQaeda or (2) has engaged or participated in terrorist ac\ntivities aimed at or harmful to the United States. Id., at\n57834. Any such individual \u201cshall, when tried, be tried by\nmilitary commission for any and all offenses triable by\nmilitary commission that such individual is alleged to\nhave committed, and may be punished in accordance with\nthe penalties provided under applicable law, including\nimprisonment or death.\u201d Ibid. The November 13 Order\nvested in the Secretary of Defense the power to appoint\n4                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmilitary commissions to try individuals subject to the\nOrder, but that power has since been delegated to John D.\nAltenberg, Jr., a retired Army major general and longtime\nmilitary lawyer who has been designated \u201cAppointing\nAuthority for Military Commissions.\u201d\n   On July 3, 2003, the President announced his determi\nnation that Hamdan and five other detainees at Guan\ntanamo Bay were subject to the November 13 Order and\nthus triable by military commission. In December 2003,\nmilitary counsel was appointed to represent Hamdan.\nTwo months later, counsel filed demands for charges and\nfor a speedy trial pursuant to Article 10 of the UCMJ, 10\nU. S. C. \u00a7810. On February 23, 2004, the legal adviser to\nthe Appointing Authority denied the applications, ruling\nthat Hamdan was not entitled to any of the protections of\nthe UCMJ. Not until July 13, 2004, after Hamdan had\ncommenced this action in the United States District Court\nfor the Western District of Washington, did the Govern\nment finally charge him with the offense for which, a year\nearlier, he had been deemed eligible for trial by military\ncommission.\n   The charging document, which is unsigned, contains 13\nnumbered paragraphs. The first two paragraphs recite\nthe asserted bases for the military commission\u2019s jurisdic\ntion\u2014namely, the November 13 Order and the President\u2019s\nJuly 3, 2003, declaration that Hamdan is eligible for trial\nby military commission. The next nine paragraphs, collec\ntively entitled \u201cGeneral Allegations,\u201d describe al Qaeda\u2019s\nactivities from its inception in 1989 through 2001 and\nidentify Osama bin Laden as the group\u2019s leader. Hamdan\nis not mentioned in these paragraphs.\n   Only the final two paragraphs, entitled \u201cCharge: Con\nspiracy,\u201d contain allegations against Hamdan. Paragraph\n12 charges that \u201cfrom on or about February 1996 to on or\nabout November 24, 2001,\u201d Hamdan \u201cwillfully and know\ningly joined an enterprise of persons who shared a com\n                    Cite as: 548 U.

Id., at 65a\u201367a.\n  After this formal charge was filed, the United States\nDistrict Court for the Western District of Washington\ntransferred Hamdan\u2019s habeas and mandamus petitions to\nthe United States District Court for the District of Colum\nbia. Meanwhile, a Combatant Status Review Tribunal\n(CSRT) convened pursuant to a military order issued on\nJuly 7, 2004, decided that Hamdan\u2019s continued detention\nat Guantanamo Bay was warranted because he was an\n\u201cenemy combatant.\u201d1 Separately, proceedings before the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 An \u201cenemy combatant\u201d is defined by the military order as \u201can indi\n\nvidual who was part of or supporting Taliban or al Qaeda forces, or\nassociated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United\n6                    HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nmilitary commission commenced.\n   On November 8, 2004, however, the District Court\ngranted Hamdan\u2019s petition for habeas corpus and stayed\nthe commission\u2019s proceedings. It concluded that the\nPresident\u2019s authority to establish military commissions\nextends only to \u201coffenders or offenses triable by military\n[commission] under the law of war,\u201d 344 F. Supp. 2d, at\n158; that the law of war includes the Geneva Convention\n(III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug.\n12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316, T. I. A. S. No. 3364 (Third\nGeneva Convention); that Hamdan is entitled to the full\nprotections of the Third Geneva Convention until ad\njudged, in compliance with that treaty, not to be a prisoner\nof war; and that, whether or not Hamdan is properly\nclassified as a prisoner of war, the military commission\nconvened to try him was established in violation of both\nthe UCMJ and Common Article 3 of the Third Geneva\nConvention because it had the power to convict based on\nevidence the accused would never see or hear. 344\nF. Supp. 2d, at 158\u2013172.\n   The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Cir\ncuit reversed. Like the District Court, the Court of Ap\npeals declined the Government\u2019s invitation to abstain from\nconsidering Hamdan\u2019s challenge. Cf. Schlesinger v. Coun\ncilman, 420 U. S. 738 (1975). On the merits, the panel\nrejected the District Court\u2019s further conclusion that Ham\ndan was entitled to relief under the Third Geneva Conven\ntion. All three judges agreed that the Geneva Conventions\nwere not \u201cjudicially enforceable,\u201d 415 F. 3d, at 38, and two\nthought that the Conventions did not in any event apply to\nHamdan, id., at 40\u201342; but see id., at 44 (Williams, J.,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nStates or its coalition partners.\u201d Memorandum from Deputy Secretary\nof Defense Paul Wolfowitz re: Order Establishing Combatant Status\nReview Tribunal \u00a7a (Jul. 7, 2004), available at http://www.defense\nlink.mil/news/Jul2004/d20040707review.pdf (all Internet materials as\nvisited June 26, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

In other portions of its opinion, the court con\ncluded that our decision in Quirin foreclosed any separation-\nof-powers objection to the military commission\u2019s jurisdiction,\nand held that Hamdan\u2019s trial before the contemplated com\nmission would violate neither the UCMJ nor U. S. Armed\nForces regulations intended to implement the Geneva Con\nventions. 415 F. 3d, at 38, 42\u201343.\n   On November 7, 2005, we granted certiorari to decide\nwhether the military commission convened to try Hamdan\nhas authority to do so, and whether Hamdan may rely on\nthe Geneva Conventions in these proceedings.\n                              II\n  On February 13, 2006, the Government filed a motion to\ndismiss the writ of certiorari. The ground cited for dis\nmissal was the recently enacted Detainee Treatment Act\nof 2005 (DTA), Pub. L. 109\u2013148, 119 Stat. 2739. We post\nponed our ruling on that motion pending argument on the\nmerits, 546 U. S. ___ (2006), and now deny it.\n  The DTA, which was signed into law on December 30,\n2005, addresses a broad swath of subjects related to de\ntainees. It places restrictions on the treatment and inter\nrogation of detainees in U. S. custody, and it furnishes\nprocedural protections for U. S. personnel accused of\nengaging in improper interrogation. DTA \u00a7\u00a71002\u20131004,\n119 Stat. 2739\u20132740.          It also sets forth certain\n\u201cPROCEDURES FOR STATUS REVIEW OF DETAINEES OUTSIDE\nTHE UNITED STATES.\u201d \u00a71005, id., at 2740. Subsections (a)\nthrough (d) of \u00a71005 direct the Secretary of Defense to\nreport to Congress the procedures being used by CSRTs to\ndetermine the proper classification of detainees held in\nGuantanamo Bay, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and to adopt\ncertain safeguards as part of those procedures.\n  Subsection (e) of \u00a71005, which is entitled \u201cJUDICIAL\nREVIEW OF DETENTION OF ENEMY COMBATANTS,\u201d supplies\nthe basis for the Government\u2019s jurisdictional argument.\n8                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe subsection contains three numbered paragraphs. The\nfirst paragraph amends the judicial code as follows:\n      \u201c(1) IN GENERAL.\u2014Section 2241 of title 28, United\n    States Code, is amended by adding at the end the\n    following:\n         .         .        .          .          .\n       \u201c \u2018(e) Except as provided in section 1005 of the De\n    tainee Treatment Act of 2005, no court, justice, or\n    judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider\u2014\n       \u201c \u2018(1) an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed\n    by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Depart\n    ment of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; or\n       \u201c \u2018(2) any other action against the United States or\n    its agents relating to any aspect of the detention by\n    the Department of Defense of an alien at Guantanamo\n    Bay, Cuba, who\u2014\n       \u201c \u2018(A) is currently in military custody; or\n       \u201c \u2018(B) has been determined by the United States\n    Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\n    in accordance with the procedures set forth in section\n    1005(e) of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 to have\n    been properly detained as an enemy combatant.\u2019 \u201d\n    \u00a71005(e), id., at 2741\u20132742.\n   Paragraph (2) of subsection (e) vests in the Court of\nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit the \u201cexclusive\njurisdiction to determine the validity of any final decision\nof a [CSRT] that an alien is properly designated as an\nenemy combatant.\u201d Paragraph (2) also delimits the scope\nof that review.

RUMSFELD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nenactment.\n   The Government argues that \u00a7\u00a71005(e)(1) and 1005(h)\nhad the immediate effect, upon enactment, of repealing\nfederal jurisdiction not just over detainee habeas actions\nyet to be filed but also over any such actions then pending\nin any federal court\u2014including this Court. Accordingly, it\nargues, we lack jurisdiction to review the Court of Appeals\u2019\ndecision below.\n   Hamdan objects to this theory on both constitutional\nand statutory grounds. Principal among his constitutional\narguments is that the Government\u2019s preferred reading\nraises grave questions about Congress\u2019 authority to im\npinge upon this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction, particularly\nin habeas cases. Support for this argument is drawn from\nEx parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85 (1869), in which, having ex\nplained that \u201cthe denial to this court of appellate jurisdic\ntion\u201d to consider an original writ of habeas corpus would\n\u201cgreatly weaken the efficacy of the writ,\u201d id., at 102\u2013103,\nwe held that Congress would not be presumed to have\neffected such denial absent an unmistakably clear state\nment to the contrary.

Hamdan also suggests that, if the Gov\nernment\u2019s reading is correct, Congress has unconstitution\nally suspended the writ of habeas corpus.\n   We find it unnecessary to reach either of these argu\nments. Ordinary principles of statutory construction suffice\nto rebut the Government\u2019s theory\u2014at least insofar as this\ncase, which was pending at the time the DTA was enacted,\nis concerned.\n   The Government acknowledges that only paragraphs (2)\nand (3) of subsection (e) are expressly made applicable to\npending cases, see \u00a71005(h)(2), 119 Stat. 2743\u20132744, but\nargues that the omission of paragraph (1) from the scope\nof that express statement is of no moment. This is so, we\nare told, because Congress\u2019 failure to expressly reserve\nfederal courts\u2019 jurisdiction over pending cases erects a\npresumption against jurisdiction, and that presumption is\nrebutted by neither the text nor the legislative history of\nthe DTA.\n   The first part of this argument is not entirely without\nsupport in our precedents. We have in the past \u201capplied\nintervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction,\nwhether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying con\nduct occurred or when the suit was filed.\u201d Landgraf v.\nUSI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 274 (1994) (citing\nBruner v. United States, 343 U. S. 112 (1952); Hallowell v.\nCommons, 239 U. S. 506 (1916)); see Republic of Austria v.\nAltmann, 541 U. S. 677, 693 (2004). But the \u201cpresump\ntion\u201d that these cases have applied is more accurately\nviewed as the nonapplication of another presumption\u2014\nviz., the presumption against retroactivity\u2014in certain\nlimited circumstances.5 If a statutory provision \u201cwould\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntaken, be, and the same is hereby repealed.\u2019 \u201d 7 Wall., at 508.\n  5 See Hughes Aircraft Co. v.

S., at 280. We have explained, however, that,\nunlike other intervening changes in the law, a jurisdiction-\nconferring or jurisdiction-stripping statute usually \u201ctakes\naway no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal\nthat is to hear the case.\u201d Hallowell, 239 U. S., at 508. If\nthat is truly all the statute does, no retroactivity problem\narises because the change in the law does not \u201cimpair\nrights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party\u2019s\nliability for past conduct, or impose new duties with re\nspect to transactions already completed.\u201d Landgraf, 511\nU. S., at 280.6 And if a new rule has no retroactive effect,\nthe presumption against retroactivity will not prevent its\napplication to a case that was already pending when the\nnew rule was enacted.\n   That does not mean, however, that all jurisdiction-\nstripping provisions\u2014or even all such provisions that\ntruly lack retroactive effect\u2014must apply to cases pending\nat the time of their enactment.7 \u201c[N]ormal rules of con\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\napplicable presumption against retroactivity . . .\u201d).\n   6 Cf.

None of those cases says that the\nabsence of an express provision reserving jurisdiction over pending\ncases trumps or renders irrelevant any other indications of congres\nsional intent. Indeed, Bruner itself relied on such other indications\u2013\nincluding a negative inference drawn from the statutory text, cf. infra,\nat 13\u2013to support its conclusion that jurisdiction was not available.

Murphy, 521\nU. S. 320, 326 (1997).8 A familiar principle of statutory\nconstruction, relevant both in Lindh and here, is that a\nnegative inference may be drawn from the exclusion of\nlanguage from one statutory provision that is included in\nother provisions of the same statute. See id., at 330; see\nalso, e.g., Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983)\n(\u201c \u2018[W]here Congress includes particular language in one\nsection of a statute but omits it in another section of the\nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts\nintentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or\nexclusion\u2019 \u201d). The Court in Lindh relied on this reasoning\nto conclude that certain limitations on the availability of\nhabeas relief imposed by AEDPA applied only to cases\nfiled after that statute\u2019s effective date. Congress\u2019 failure to\nidentify the temporal reach of those limitations, which\ngoverned noncapital cases, stood in contrast to its express\ncommand in the same legislation that new rules governing\nhabeas petitions in capital cases \u201capply to cases pending\non or after the date of enactment.\u201d \u00a7107(c), 110 Stat. 1226;\nsee Lindh, 521 U. S., at 329\u2013330. That contrast, combined\nwith the fact that the amendments at issue \u201caffect[ed]\nsubstantive entitlement to relief,\u201d id., at 327, warranted\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncourt cases addressing the Tucker Act that it ought to specifically\nreserve jurisdiction over pending cases, see 343 U. S., at 115, and (2) in\ncontrast to the congressional silence concerning reservation of jurisdic\ntion, reservation had been made of \u201c \u2018any rights or liabilities\u2019 existing at\nthe effective date of the Act\u201d repealed by another provision of the Act,\nibid., n. 7.\n   8 The question in Lindh was whether new limitations on the avail\n\nability of habeas relief imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective\nDeath Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, applied to habeas\nactions pending on the date of AEDPA\u2019s enactment. We held that they\ndid not. At the outset, we rejected the State\u2019s argument that, in the\nabsence of a clear congressional statement to the contrary, a \u201cproce\ndural\u201d rule must apply to pending cases. 521 U. S., at 326.\n14                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndrawing a negative inference.\n  A like inference follows a fortiori from Lindh in this\ncase. \u201cIf . . . Congress was reasonably concerned to ensure\nthat [\u00a7\u00a71005(e)(2) and (3)] be applied to pending cases, it\nshould have been just as concerned about [\u00a71005(e)(1)],\nunless it had the different intent that the latter [section]\nnot be applied to the general run of pending cases.\u201d Id., at\n329. If anything, the evidence of deliberate omission is\nstronger here than it was in Lindh. In Lindh, the provi\nsions to be contrasted had been drafted separately but\nwere later \u201cjoined together and . . . considered simultane\nously when the language raising the implication was\ninserted.\u201d Id., at 330. We observed that Congress\u2019 tandem\nreview and approval of the two sets of provisions strength\nened the presumption that the relevant omission was\ndeliberate. Id., at 331; see also Field v. Mans, 516 U. S.\n59, 75 (1995) (\u201cThe more apparently deliberate the con\ntrast, the stronger the inference, as applied, for example,\nto contrasting statutory sections originally enacted simul\ntaneously in relevant respects\u201d). Here, Congress not only\nconsidered the respective temporal reaches of paragraphs\n(1), (2), and (3) of subsection (e) together at every stage,\nbut omitted paragraph (1) from its directive that para\ngraphs (2) and (3) apply to pending cases only after having\nrejected earlier proposed versions of the statute that would\nhave included what is now paragraph (1) within the scope\nof that directive. Compare DTA \u00a71005(h)(2), 119 Stat.\n2743\u20132744, with 151 Cong. Rec. S12655 (Nov. 10, 2005) (S.\nAmdt. 2515); see id., at S14257\u2013S14258 (Dec. 21, 2005)\n(discussing similar language proposed in both the House\nand the Senate).9 Congress\u2019 rejection of the very language\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 That paragraph (1), along with paragraphs (2) and (3), is to \u201ctake\n\neffect on the date of enactment,\u201d DTA \u00a71005(h)(1), 119 Stat. 2743, is not\ndispositive; \u201ca \u2018statement that a statute will become effective on a\ncertain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application\nto conduct that occurred at an earlier date.\u2019 \u201d INS v.

Certainly, the \u201ceffective date\u201d provision cannot bear the\nweight JUSTICE SCALIA would place on it. See post, at 5, and n. 1.\nCongress deemed that provision insufficient, standing alone, to render\nsubsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applicable to pending cases; hence its\nadoption of subsection (h)(2). JUSTICE SCALIA seeks to avoid reducing\nsubsection (h)(2) to a mere redundancy\u2014a consequence he seems to\nacknowledge must otherwise follow from his interpretation\u2014by specu\nlating that Congress had special reasons, not also relevant to subsec\ntion (e)(1), to worry that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) would be ruled\ninapplicable to pending cases. As we explain infra, at 17, and n. 12,\nthat attempt fails.\n   10 We note that statements made by Senators preceding passage of\n\nthe Act lend further support to what the text of the DTA and its draft\ning history already make plain. Senator Levin, one of the sponsors of\nthe final bill, objected to earlier versions of the Act\u2019s \u201ceffective date\u201d\nprovision that would have made subsection (e)(1) applicable to pending\ncases. See, e.g., 151 Cong. Rec. S12667 (Nov. 10, 2005) (amendment\nproposed by Sen. Graham that would have rendered what is now\nsubsection (e)(1) applicable to \u201cany application or other action that is\npending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act\u201d). Senator\nLevin urged adoption of an alternative amendment that \u201cwould apply\nonly to new habeas cases filed after the date of enactment.\u201d Id., at\nS12802 (Nov. 15, 2005). That alternative amendment became the text\nof subsection (h)(2). (In light of the extensive discussion of the DTA\u2019s\neffect on pending cases prior to passage of the Act, see, e.g., id., at\nS12664 (Nov. 10, 2005); id., at S12755 (Nov. 14, 2005); id., at S12799\u2013\nS12802 (Nov. 15, 2005); id., at S14245, S14252\u2013S14253, S14257\u2013\nS14258, S14274\u2013S14275 (Dec. 21, 2005), it cannot be said that the\nchanges to subsection (h)(2) were inconsequential. Cf. post, at 14\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting).)\n   While statements attributed to the final bill\u2019s two other sponsors,\nSenators Graham and Kyl, arguably contradict Senator Levin\u2019s conten\ntion that the final version of the Act preserved jurisdiction over pending\nhabeas cases, see 151 Cong. Rec. S14263\u2013S14264 (Dec. 21, 2005), those\nstatements appear to have been inserted into the Congressional Record\nafter the Senate debate.

First, it asserts that Lindh is inapposite\nbecause \u201cSection 1005(e)(1) and (h)(1) remove jurisdiction,\nwhile Section 1005(e)(2), (3) and (h)(2) create an exclusive\nreview mechanism and define the nature of that review.\u201d\nReply Brief in Support of Respondents\u2019 Motion to Dismiss\n4. Because the provisions being contrasted \u201caddress\nwholly distinct subject matters,\u201d Martin v. Hadix, 527\nU. S. 343, 356 (1999), the Government argues, Congress\u2019\ndifferent treatment of them is of no significance.\n   This argument must fail because it rests on a false dis\ntinction between the \u201cjurisdictional\u201d nature of subsection\n(e)(1) and the \u201cprocedural\u201d character of subsections (e)(2)\nand (e)(3). In truth, all three provisions govern jurisdic\ntion over detainees\u2019 claims; subsection (e)(1) addresses\njurisdiction in habeas cases and other actions \u201crelating to\nany aspect of the detention,\u201d while subsections (e)(2) and\n(3) vest exclusive,11 but limited, jurisdiction in the Court of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nfor fiscal year 2006\u201d (emphasis added)). All statements made during\nthe debate itself support Senator Levin\u2019s understanding that the final\ntext of the DTA would not render subsection (e)(1) applicable to pend\ning cases.

RUMSFELD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity ques\ntions under our precedents. The provisions impose no\nadditional liability or obligation on any private party or\neven on the United States, unless one counts the burden of\nlitigating an appeal\u2014a burden not a single one of our\ncases suggests triggers retroactivity concerns.13 Moreover,\nit strains credulity to suggest that the desire to reinforce\nthe application of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) to pending\ncases drove Congress to exclude subsection (e)(1) from\n\u00a71005(h)(2).\n   The Government\u2019s second objection is that applying\nsubsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) but not (e)(1) to pending cases\n\u201cproduces an absurd result\u201d because it grants (albeit only\ntemporarily) dual jurisdiction over detainees\u2019 cases in\ncircumstances where the statute plainly envisions that the\nDistrict of Columbia Circuit will have \u201cexclusive\u201d and\nimmediate jurisdiction over such cases. Reply Brief in\nSupport of Respondents\u2019 Motion to Dismiss 7. But the\npremise here is faulty; subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) grant\njurisdiction only over actions to \u201cdetermine the validity of\nany final decision\u201d of a CSRT or commission. Because\nHamdan, at least, is not contesting any \u201cfinal decision\u201d of\na CSRT or military commission, his action does not fall\nwithin the scope of subsection (e)(2) or (e)(3).

There is nothing absurd about a scheme under\nwhich pending habeas actions\u2014particularly those, like\nthis one, that challenge the very legitimacy of the tribu\nnals whose judgments Congress would like to have re\nviewed\u2014are preserved, and more routine challenges to\nfinal decisions rendered by those tribunals are carefully\nchanneled to a particular court and through a particular\nlens of review.\n   Finally, we cannot leave unaddressed JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s\ncontentions that the \u201cmeaning of \u00a71005(e)(1) is entirely\nclear,\u201d post, at 6, and that \u201cthe plain import of a statute\nrepealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider\nand render judgment\u2014in an already pending case no less\nthan in a case yet to be filed,\u201d post, at 3 (emphasis in\noriginal). Only by treating the Bruner rule as an inflexible\ntrump (a thing it has never been, see n. 7, supra) and\nignoring both the rest of \u00a71005\u2019s text and its drafting\nhistory can one conclude as much. Congress here ex\npressly provided that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applied\nto pending cases. It chose not to so provide\u2014after having\nbeen presented with the option\u2014for subsection (e)(1). The\nomission is an integral part of the statutory scheme that\nmuddies whatever \u201cplain meaning\u201d may be discerned from\nblinkered study of subsection (e)(1) alone. The dissent\u2019s\nspeculation about what Congress might have intended by\nthe omission not only is counterfactual, cf. n. 10, supra\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe time the DTA was enacted that do qualify as challenges to \u201cfinal\ndecision[s]\u201d within the meaning of subsection (e)(2) or (e)(3). We\nexpress no view about whether the DTA would require transfer of such\nan action to the District of Columbia Circuit.\n20                    HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n(recounting legislative history), but rests on both a mis\nconstruction of the DTA and an erroneous view our prece\ndents, see supra, at 17, and n. 12.\n  For these reasons, we deny the Government\u2019s motion to\ndismiss.15\n                              III\n  Relying on our decision in Councilman, 420 U. S. 738,\nthe Government argues that, even if we have statutory\njurisdiction, we should apply the \u201cjudge-made rule that\ncivilian courts should await the final outcome of on-going\nmilitary proceedings before entertaining an attack on\nthose proceedings.\u201d Brief for Respondents 12. Like the\nDistrict Court and the Court of Appeals before us, we\nreject this argument.\n  In Councilman, an army officer on active duty was\nreferred to a court-martial for trial on charges that he\nviolated the UCMJ by selling, transferring, and possessing\nmarijuana. 420 U. S., at 739\u2013740. Objecting that the\nalleged offenses were not \u201c \u2018service connected,\u2019 \u201d id., at 740,\nthe officer filed suit in Federal District Court to enjoin the\nproceedings. He neither questioned the lawfulness of\ncourts-martial or their procedures nor disputed that, as a\nserviceman, he was subject to court-martial jurisdiction.\nHis sole argument was that the subject matter of his case\ndid not fall within the scope of court-martial authority.\nSee id., at 741, 759. The District Court granted his re\nquest for injunctive relief, and the Court of Appeals\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 Because we conclude that \u00a71005(e)(1) does not strip federal courts\u2019\n\njurisdiction over cases pending on the date of the DTA\u2019s enactment, we\ndo not decide whether, if it were otherwise, this Court would nonethe\nless retain jurisdiction to hear Hamdan\u2019s appeal. Cf. supra, at 10. Nor\ndo we decide the manner in which the canon of constitutional avoidance\nshould affect subsequent interpretation of the DTA. See, e.g., St. Cyr,\n533 U. S., at 300 (a construction of a statute \u201cthat would entirely\npreclude review of a pure question of law by any court would give rise\nto substantial constitutional questions\u201d).\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                  21\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\naffirmed.\n   We granted certiorari and reversed. Id., at 761. We did\nnot reach the merits of whether the marijuana charges\nwere sufficiently \u201cservice connected\u201d to place them within\nthe subject-matter jurisdiction of a court-martial. Instead,\nwe concluded that, as a matter of comity, federal courts\nshould normally abstain from intervening in pending\ncourt-martial proceedings against members of the Armed\nForces,16 and further that there was nothing in the par\nticular circumstances of the officer\u2019s case to displace that\ngeneral rule. See id., at 740, 758.\n   Councilman identifies two considerations of comity that\ntogether favor abstention pending completion of ongoing\ncourt-martial proceedings against service personnel. See\nNew v. Cohen, 129 F. 3d 639, 643 (CADC 1997); see also\n415 F. 3d, at 36\u201337 (discussing Councilman and New).\nFirst, military discipline and, therefore, the efficient op\neration of the Armed Forces are best served if the military\njustice system acts without regular interference from\ncivilian courts. See Councilman, 420 U. S., at 752. Sec\nond, federal courts should respect the balance that Con\ngress struck between military preparedness and fairness\nto individual service members when it created \u201can inte\ngrated system of military courts and review procedures, a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  16 Councilman   distinguished service personnel from civilians, whose\nchallenges to ongoing military proceedings are cognizable in federal\ncourt. See, e.g., United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11\n(1955). As we explained in Councilman, abstention is not appropriate\nin cases in which individuals raise \u201c \u2018substantial arguments denying the\nright of the military to try them at all,\u2019 \u201d and in which the legal chal\nlenge \u201cturn[s] on the status of the persons as to whom the military\nasserted its power.\u201d 420 U. S., at 759 (quoting Noyd v. Bond, 395 U. S.\n683, 696, n. 8 (1969)). In other words, we do not apply Councilman\nabstention when there is a substantial question whether a military\ntribunal has personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Because we\nconclude that abstention is inappropriate for a more basic reason, we\nneed not consider whether the jurisdictional exception recognized in\nCouncilman applies here.\n22                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncritical element of which is the Court of Military Appeals,\nconsisting of civilian judges \u2018completely removed from all\nmilitary influence or persuasion . . . .\u2019 \u201d Id., at 758 (quot\ning H. R. Rep. No. 491, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., p. 7 (1949)).\nJust as abstention in the face of ongoing state criminal\nproceedings is justified by our expectation that state\ncourts will enforce federal rights, so abstention in the face\nof ongoing court-martial proceedings is justified by our\nexpectation that the military court system established by\nCongress\u2014with its substantial procedural protections and\nprovision for appellate review by independent civilian\njudges\u2014\u201cwill vindicate servicemen\u2019s constitutional rights,\u201d\n420 U. S., at 758. See id., at 755\u2013758.17\n  The same cannot be said here; indeed, neither of the\ncomity considerations identified in Councilman weighs in\nfavor of abstention in this case. First, Hamdan is not a\nmember of our Nation\u2019s Armed Forces, so concerns about\nmilitary discipline do not apply. Second, the tribunal\nconvened to try Hamdan is not part of the integrated\nsystem of military courts, complete with independent\nreview panels, that Congress has established. Unlike the\nofficer in Councilman, Hamdan has no right to appeal any\nconviction to the civilian judges of the Court of Military\nAppeals (now called the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Armed Forces, see Pub. L. 103\u2013337, 108 Stat.\n2831). Instead, under Dept. of Defense Military Commis\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  17 See also Noyd, 395 U.

Commis\nsion Order No. 1 \u00a76(H)(4). Commission Order No. 1 pro\nvides that appeal of a review panel\u2019s decision may be had\nonly to the Secretary of Defense himself, \u00a76(H)(5), and\nthen, finally, to the President, \u00a76(H)(6).18\n   We have no doubt that the various individuals assigned\nreview power under Commission Order No. 1 would strive\nto act impartially and ensure that Hamdan receive all\nprotections to which he is entitled. Nonetheless, these\nreview bodies clearly lack the structural insulation from\nmilitary influence that characterizes the Court of Appeals\nfor the Armed Forces, and thus bear insufficient concep\ntual similarity to state courts to warrant invocation of\nabstention principles.19\n   In sum, neither of the two comity considerations under\nlying our decision to abstain in Councilman applies to the\ncircumstances of this case. Instead, this Court\u2019s decision\nin Quirin is the most relevant precedent. In Quirin, seven\nGerman saboteurs were captured upon arrival by subma\nrine in New York and Florida. 317 U. S., at 21. The Presi\ndent convened a military commission to try the saboteurs,\nwho then filed habeas corpus petitions in the United\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  18 If he chooses, the President may delegate this ultimate decision-\n\nmaking authority to the Secretary of Defense.

See post, at 22.\nWhether or not the limited review permitted under the DTA may be\ntreated as akin to the plenary review exercised by the Court of Appeals\nfor the Armed Forces, petitioner here is not afforded a right to such\nreview. See infra, at 52; \u00a71005(e)(3), 119 Stat. 2743.\n24                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nStates District Court for the District of Columbia challeng\ning their trial by commission. We granted the saboteurs\u2019\npetition for certiorari to the Court of Appeals before judg\nment. See id., at 19. Far from abstaining pending the\nconclusion of military proceedings, which were ongoing,\nwe convened a special Term to hear the case and expedited\nour review. That course of action was warranted, we\nexplained, \u201c[i]n view of the public importance of the ques\ntions raised by [the cases] and of the duty which rests on\nthe courts, in time of war as well as in time of peace, to\npreserve unimpaired the constitutional safeguards of civil\nliberty, and because in our opinion the public interest\nrequired that we consider and decide those questions\nwithout any avoidable delay.\u201d Ibid.\n   As the Court of Appeals here recognized, Quirin \u201cpro\nvides a compelling historical precedent for the power of\ncivilian courts to entertain challenges that seek to inter\nrupt the processes of military commissions.\u201d 415 F. 3d, at\n36.20 The circumstances of this case, like those in Quirin,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   20 Having correctly declined to abstain from addressing Hamdan\u2019s\n\nchallenge to the lawfulness of the military commission convened to try\nhim, the Court of Appeals suggested that Councilman abstention\nnonetheless applied to bar its consideration of one of Hamdan\u2019s argu\nments\u2014namely, that his commission violated Article 3 of the Third\nGeneva Convention, 6 U. S. T. 3316, 3318. See Part VI, infra. Al\nthough the Court of Appeals rejected the Article 3 argument on the\nmerits, it also stated that, because the challenge was not \u201cjurisdic\ntional,\u201d it did not fall within the exception that Schlesinger v. Council\nman, 420 U. S. 738 (1975), recognized for defendants who raise sub\nstantial arguments that a military tribunal lacks personal jurisdiction\nover them. See 415 F. 3d, at 42.\n   In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals conflated two\ndistinct inquiries: (1) whether Hamdan has raised a substantial argu\nment that the military commission lacks authority to try him; and,\nmore fundamentally, (2) whether the comity considerations underlying\nCouncilman apply to trigger the abstention principle in the first place.\nAs the Court of Appeals acknowledged at the beginning of its opinion,\nthe first question warrants consideration only if the answer to the\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                  25\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nsimply do not implicate the \u201cobligations of comity\u201d that,\nunder appropriate circumstances, justify abstention.\nQuackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U. S. 706, 733 (1996)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring).\n   Finally, the Government has identified no other \u201cimpor\ntant countervailing interest\u201d that would permit federal\ncourts to depart from their general \u201cduty to exercise the\njurisdiction that is conferred upon them by Congress.\u201d Id.,\nat 716 (majority opinion). To the contrary, Hamdan and\nthe Government both have a compelling interest in know\ning in advance whether Hamdan may be tried by a mili\ntary commission that arguably is without any basis in law\nand operates free from many of the procedural rules pre\nscribed by Congress for courts-martial\u2014rules intended to\nsafeguard the accused and ensure the reliability of any\nconviction. While we certainly do not foreclose the possi\nbility that abstention may be appropriate in some cases\nseeking review of ongoing military commission proceed\nings (such as military commissions convened on the battle\nfield), the foregoing discussion makes clear that, under our\nprecedent, abstention is not justified here. We therefore\nproceed to consider the merits of Hamdan\u2019s challenge.\n                           IV\n  The military commission, a tribunal neither mentioned\nin the Constitution nor created by statute, was born of\nmilitary necessity. See W. Winthrop, Military Law and\nPrecedents 831 (rev. 2d ed. 1920) (hereinafter Winthrop).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsecond is yes. See 415 F. 3d, at 36\u201337. Since, as the Court of Appeals\nproperly concluded, the answer to the second question is in fact no,\nthere is no need to consider any exception.\n   At any rate, it appears that the exception would apply here. As\ndiscussed in Part VI, infra, Hamdan raises a substantial argument\nthat, because the military commission that has been convened to try\nhim is not a \u201c \u2018regularly constituted court\u2019 \u201d under the Geneva Conven\ntions, it is ultra vires and thus lacks jurisdiction over him. Brief for\nPetitioner 5.\n26                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThough foreshadowed in some respects by earlier tribu\nnals like the Board of General Officers that General Wash\nington convened to try British Major John Andr\u00e9 for spy\ning during the Revolutionary War, the commission \u201cas\nsuch\u201d was inaugurated in 1847. Id., at 832; G. Davis, A\nTreatise on the Military Law of the United States 308 (2d\ned. 1909) (hereinafter Davis). As commander of occupied\nMexican territory, and having available to him no other\ntribunal, General Winfield Scott that year ordered the\nestablishment of both \u201c \u2018military commissions\u2019 \u201d to try\nordinary crimes committed in the occupied territory and a\n\u201ccouncil of war\u201d to try offenses against the law of war.\nWinthrop 832 (emphases in original).\n   When the exigencies of war next gave rise to a need for\nuse of military commissions, during the Civil War, the\ndual system favored by General Scott was not adopted.\nInstead, a single tribunal often took jurisdiction over\nordinary crimes, war crimes, and breaches of military\norders alike. As further discussed below, each aspect of\nthat seemingly broad jurisdiction was in fact supported by\na separate military exigency. Generally, though, the need\nfor military commissions during this period\u2014as during the\nMexican War\u2014was driven largely by the then very limited\njurisdiction of courts-martial: \u201cThe occasion for the mili\ntary commission arises principally from the fact that the\njurisdiction of the court-martial proper, in our law, is\nrestricted by statute almost exclusively to members of the\nmilitary force and to certain specific offences defined in a\nwritten code.\u201d Id., at 831 (emphasis in original).\n   Exigency alone, of course, will not justify the establish\nment and use of penal tribunals not contemplated by\nArticle I, \u00a78 and Article III, \u00a71 of the Constitution unless\nsome other part of that document authorizes a response to\nthe felt need.

RUMSFELD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Whether Chief Justice Chase was correct in suggesting\nthat the President may constitutionally convene military\ncommissions \u201cwithout the sanction of Congress\u201d in cases of\n\u201ccontrolling necessity\u201d is a question this Court has not\nanswered definitively, and need not answer today. For we\nheld in Quirin that Congress had, through Article of War\n15, sanctioned the use of military commissions in such\ncircumstances. 317 U. S., at 28 (\u201cBy the Articles of War,\nand especially Article 15, Congress has explicitly provided,\nso far as it may constitutionally do so, that military tribu\nnals shall have jurisdiction to try offenders or offenses\nagainst the law of war in appropriate cases\u201d). Article 21 of\nthe UCMJ, the language of which is substantially identical\nto the old Article 15 and was preserved by Congress after\nWorld War II,22 reads as follows:\n     \u201cJurisdiction of courts-martial not exclusive.\n     \u201cThe provisions of this code conferring jurisdiction\n     upon courts-martial shall not be construed as depriv\n     ing military commissions, provost courts, or other\n     military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction in respect\n     of offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of\n     war may be tried by such military commissions, pro\n     vost courts, or other military tribunals.\u201d 64 Stat. 115.\n  We have no occasion to revisit Quirin\u2019s controversial\ncharacterization of Article of War 15 as congressional\nauthorization for military commissions.

S., at 28\u201329.23 That much\nis evidenced by the Court\u2019s inquiry, following its conclu\nsion that Congress had authorized military commissions,\ninto whether the law of war had indeed been complied\nwith in that case. See ibid.\n   The Government would have us dispense with the in\nquiry that the Quirin Court undertook and find in either\nthe AUMF or the DTA specific, overriding authorization\nfor the very commission that has been convened to try\nHamdan. Neither of these congressional Acts, however,\nexpands the President\u2019s authority to convene military\ncommissions. First, while we assume that the AUMF\nactivated the President\u2019s war powers, see Hamdi v. Rums\nfeld, 542 U. S. 507 (2004) (plurality opinion), and that\nthose powers include the authority to convene military\ncommissions in appropriate circumstances, see id., at 518;\nQuirin, 317 U. S., at 28\u201329; see also Yamashita, 327 U. S.,\nat 11, there is nothing in the text or legislative history of\nthe AUMF even hinting that Congress intended to expand\nor alter the authorization set forth in Article 21 of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  23 Whether or not the President has independent power, absent con\n\ngressional authorization, to convene military commissions, he may not\ndisregard limitations that Congress has, in proper exercise of its own\nwar powers, placed on his powers. See Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v.\nSawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). The\nGovernment does not argue otherwise.\n30                    HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nUCMJ. Cf. Yerger, 8 Wall., at 105 (\u201cRepeals by implica\ntion are not favored\u201d).24\n   Likewise, the DTA cannot be read to authorize this\ncommission. Although the DTA, unlike either Article 21\nor the AUMF, was enacted after the President had con\nvened Hamdan\u2019s commission, it contains no language\nauthorizing that tribunal or any other at Guantanamo\nBay. The DTA obviously \u201crecognize[s]\u201d the existence of the\nGuantanamo Bay commissions in the weakest sense, Brief\nfor Respondents 15, because it references some of the\nmilitary orders governing them and creates limited judi\ncial review of their \u201cfinal decision[s],\u201d DTA \u00a71005(e)(3),\n119 Stat. 2743. But the statute also pointedly reserves\njudgment on whether \u201cthe Constitution and laws of the\nUnited States are applicable\u201d in reviewing such decisions\nand whether, if they are, the \u201cstandards and procedures\u201d\nused to try Hamdan and other detainees actually violate\nthe \u201cConstitution and laws.\u201d Ibid.\n   Together, the UCMJ, the AUMF, and the DTA at most\nacknowledge a general Presidential authority to convene\nmilitary commissions in circumstances where justified\nunder the \u201cConstitution and laws,\u201d including the law of\nwar. Absent a more specific congressional authorization,\nthe task of this Court is, as it was in Quirin, to decide\nwhether Hamdan\u2019s military commission is so justified. It\nis to that inquiry we now turn.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  24 On this point, it is noteworthy that the Court in Ex parte Quirin,\n\n317 U. S. 1 (1942), looked beyond Congress\u2019 declaration of war and\naccompanying authorization for use of force during World War II, and\nrelied instead on Article of War 15 to find that Congress had authorized\nthe use of military commissions in some circumstances. See id., at 26\u2013\n29. JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019 assertion that we commit \u201cerror\u201d in reading\nArticle 21 of the UCMJ to place limitations upon the President\u2019s use of\nmilitary commissions, see post, at 5 (dissenting opinion), ignores the\nreasoning in Quirin.\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

Commissions historically have been used in\nthree situations. See Bradley & Goldsmith, Congressional\nAuthorization and the War on Terrorism, 118 Harv.\nL. Rev. 2048, 2132\u20132133 (2005); Winthrop 831\u2013846; Hear\nings on H. R. 2498 before the Subcommittee of the House\nCommittee on Armed Services, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 975\n(1949). First, they have substituted for civilian courts at\ntimes and in places where martial law has been declared.\nTheir use in these circumstances has raised constitutional\nquestions, see Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 327 U. S. 304\n(1946); Milligan, 4 Wall., at 121\u2013122, but is well recog\nnized.25 See Winthrop 822, 836\u2013839. Second, commis\nsions have been established to try civilians \u201cas part of a\ntemporary military government over occupied enemy\nterritory or territory regained from an enemy where civil\nian government cannot and does not function.\u201d Duncan,\n327 U. S., at 314; see Milligan, 4 Wall., at 141\u2013142 (Chase,\nC. J., concurring in judgment) (distinguishing \u201cMARTIAL\nLAW PROPER\u201d from \u201cMILITARY GOVERNMENT\u201d in occupied\nterritory). Illustrative of this second kind of commission is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  25 The    justification for, and limitations on, these commissions were\nsummarized in Milligan:\n   \u201cIf, in foreign invasion or civil war, the courts are actually closed, and\nit is impossible to administer criminal justice according to law, then, on\nthe theatre of active military operations, where war really prevails,\nthere is a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority, thus\noverthrown, to preserve the safety of the army and society; and as no\npower is left but the military, it is allowed to govern by martial rule\nuntil the laws can have their free course. As necessity creates the rule,\nso it limits its duration; for, if this government is continued after the\ncourts are reinstated, it is a gross usurpation of power. Martial rule\ncan never exist where the courts are open, and in the proper and\nunobstructed exercise of their jurisdiction. It is also confined to the\nlocality of actual war.\u201d 4 Wall., at 127 (emphases in original).\n32                    HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nthe one that was established, with jurisdiction to apply the\nGerman Criminal Code, in occupied Germany following\nthe end of World War II. See Madsen v. Kinsella, 343\nU. S. 341, 356 (1952).26\n  The third type of commission, convened as an \u201cincident\nto the conduct of war\u201d when there is a need \u201cto seize and\nsubject to disciplinary measures those enemies who in\ntheir attempt to thwart or impede our military effort have\nviolated the law of war,\u201d Quirin, 317 U. S., at 28\u201329, has\nbeen described as \u201cutterly different\u201d from the other two.\nBickers, Military Commissions are Constitutionally Sound:\nA Response to Professors Katyal and Tribe, 34 Tex. Tech.\nL. Rev. 899, 902 (2002\u20132003).27 Not only is its jurisdiction\nlimited to offenses cognizable during time of war, but its\nrole is primarily a factfinding one\u2014to determine, typically\non the battlefield itself, whether the defendant has vio\nlated the law of war.

Armed Forces\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   26 The limitations on these occupied territory or military government\n\ncommissions are tailored to the tribunals\u2019 purpose and the exigencies\nthat necessitate their use. They may be employed \u201cpending the estab\nlishment of civil government,\u201d Madsen, 343 U. S., at 354\u2013355, which\nmay in some cases extend beyond the \u201ccessation of hostilities,\u201d id., at\n348.\n   27 So much may not be evident on cold review of the Civil War trials\n\noften cited as precedent for this kind of tribunal because the commis\nsions established during that conflict operated as both martial law or\nmilitary government tribunals and law-of-war commissions. Hence,\n\u201cmilitary commanders began the practice [during the Civil War] of\nusing the same name, the same rules, and often the same tribunals\u201d to\ntry both ordinary crimes and war crimes. Bickers, 34 Tex. Tech. L. Rev.,\nat 908. \u201cFor the first time, accused horse thieves and alleged saboteurs\nfound themselves subject to trial by the same military commission.\u201d\nId., at 909. The Civil War precedents must therefore be considered\nwith caution; as we recognized in Quirin, 317 U. S., at 29, and as\nfurther discussed below, commissions convened during time of war but\nunder neither martial law nor military government may try only\noffenses against the law of war.\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                   33\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nused the law-of-war military commission was during\nWorld War II. In Quirin, this Court sanctioned President\nRoosevelt\u2019s use of such a tribunal to try Nazi saboteurs\ncaptured on American soil during the War. 317 U. S. 1.\nAnd in Yamashita, we held that a military commission\nhad jurisdiction to try a Japanese commander for failing to\nprevent troops under his command from committing\natrocities in the Philippines. 327 U. S. 1.\n   Quirin is the model the Government invokes most fre\nquently to defend the commission convened to try Ham\ndan. That is both appropriate and unsurprising. Since\nGuantanamo Bay is neither enemy-occupied territory nor\nunder martial law, the law-of-war commission is the only\nmodel available. At the same time, no more robust model\nof executive power exists; Quirin represents the high-\nwater mark of military power to try enemy combatants for\nwar crimes.\n   The classic treatise penned by Colonel William Win\nthrop, whom we have called \u201cthe \u2018Blackstone of Military\nLaw,\u2019 \u201d Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 19, n. 38 (1957) (plural\nity opinion), describes at least four preconditions for exer\ncise of jurisdiction by a tribunal of the type convened to try\nHamdan. First, \u201c[a] military commission, (except where\notherwise authorized by statute), can legally assume\njurisdiction only of offenses committed within the field of\nthe command of the convening commander.\u201d Winthrop\n836. The \u201cfield of command\u201d in these circumstances means\nthe \u201ctheatre of war.\u201d Ibid. Second, the offense charged\n\u201cmust have been committed within the period of the\nwar.\u201d28 Id., at 837. No jurisdiction exists to try offenses\n\u201ccommitted either before or after the war.\u201d Ibid. Third, a\nmilitary commission not established pursuant to martial\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  28 If the commission is established pursuant to martial law or military\n\ngovernment, its jurisdiction extends to offenses committed within \u201cthe\nexercise of military government or martial law.\u201d Winthrop 837.\n34                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nlaw or an occupation may try only \u201c[i]ndividuals of the\nenemy\u2019s army who have been guilty of illegitimate warfare\nor other offences in violation of the laws of war\u201d and mem\nbers of one\u2019s own army \u201cwho, in time of war, become\nchargeable with crimes or offences not cognizable, or\ntriable, by the criminal courts or under the Articles of\nwar.\u201d Id., at 838. Finally, a law-of-war commission has\njurisdiction to try only two kinds of offense: \u201cViolations of\nthe laws and usages of war cognizable by military tribu\nnals only,\u201d and \u201c[b]reaches of military orders or regula\ntions for which offenders are not legally triable by court-\nmartial under the Articles of war.\u201d Id., at 839.29\n   All parties agree that Colonel Winthrop\u2019s treatise accu\nrately describes the common law governing military com\nmissions, and that the jurisdictional limitations he identi\nfies were incorporated in Article of War 15 and, later,\nArticle 21 of the UCMJ. It also is undisputed that Ham\ndan\u2019s commission lacks jurisdiction to try him unless the\ncharge \u201cproperly set[s] forth, not only the details of the\nact charged, but the circumstances conferring jurisdic\ntion.\u201d Id., at 842 (emphasis in original). The question is\nwhether the preconditions designed to ensure that a mili\ntary necessity exists to justify the use of this extraordi\nnary tribunal have been satisfied here.\n   The charge against Hamdan, described in detail in Part\nI, supra, alleges a conspiracy extending over a number of\nyears, from 1996 to November 2001.30 All but two months\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  29 Winthrop adds as a fifth, albeit not-always-complied-with, criterion\n\nthat \u201cthe trial must be had within the theatre of war . . . ; that, if held\nelsewhere, and where the civil courts are open and available, the\nproceedings and sentence will be coram non judice.\u201d Id., at 836. The\nGovernment does not assert that Guantanamo Bay is a theater of war,\nbut instead suggests that neither Washington, D. C., in 1942 nor the\nPhilippines in 1945 qualified as a \u201cwar zone\u201d either. Brief for Respon\ndents 27; cf. Quirin, 317 U. S. 1; In re Yamashita, 327 U. S. 1 (1946).\n  30 The elements of this conspiracy charge have been defined not by\n\nCongress but by the President. See Military Commission Instruction\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

See post, at 7\u201310\n(dissenting opinion). But even the Government does not go so far;\nalthough the United States had for some time prior to the attacks of\nSeptember 11, 2001, been aggressively pursuing al Qaeda, neither in\nthe charging document nor in submissions before this Court has the\nGovernment asserted that the President\u2019s war powers were activated\nprior to September 11, 2001. Cf. Brief for Respondents 25 (describing\nthe events of September 11, 2001, as \u201can act of war\u201d that \u201ctriggered a\nright to deploy military forces abroad to defend the United States by\ncombating al Qaeda\u201d). JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019 further argument that the\nAUMF is \u201cbackward looking\u201d and therefore authorizes trial by military\ncommission of crimes that occurred prior to the inception of war is\ninsupportable. See post, at 8, n. 3. If nothing else, Article 21 of the\nUCMJ requires that the President comply with the law of war in his\nuse of military commissions. As explained in the text, the law of war\npermits trial only of offenses \u201ccommitted within the period of the war.\u201d\nWinthrop 837; see also Quirin, 317 U. S., at 28\u201329 (observing that law-\nof-war military commissions may be used to try \u201cthose enemies who in\ntheir attempt to thwart or impede our military effort have violated the\nlaw of war\u201d (emphasis added)). The sources that JUSTICE THOMAS relies\non to suggest otherwise simply do not support his position. Colonel\nGreen\u2019s short exegesis on military commissions cites Howland for the\nproposition that \u201c[o]ffenses committed before a formal declaration of\nwar or before the declaration of martial law may be tried by military\ncommission.\u201d The Military Commission, 42 Am. J. Int\u2019l L. 832, 848\n(1948) (emphases added) (cited post, at 9\u201310). Assuming that to be\ntrue, nothing in our analysis turns on the admitted absence of either a\nformal declaration of war or a declaration of martial law. Our focus\ninstead is on the September 11, 2001 attacks that the Government\ncharacterizes as the relevant \u201cact[s] of war,\u201d and on the measure that\nauthorized the President\u2019s deployment of military force\u2014the AUMF.\nBecause we do not question the Government\u2019s position that the war\ncommenced with the events of September 11, 2001, the Prize Cases, 2\nBlack 635 (1863) (cited post, at 2, 7, 8, and 10 (THOMAS, J., dissenting)),\n36                    HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nagreement with Osama bin Laden and others to commit\nwar crimes, nor a single overt act, is alleged to have oc\ncurred in a theater of war or on any specified date after\nSeptember 11, 2001. None of the overt acts that Hamdan is\nalleged to have committed violates the law of war.\n  These facts alone cast doubt on the legality of the charge\nand, hence, the commission; as Winthrop makes plain, the\noffense alleged must have been committed both in a thea\nter of war and during, not before, the relevant conflict.\nBut the deficiencies in the time and place allegations also\nunderscore\u2014indeed are symptomatic of\u2014the most serious\ndefect of this charge: The offense it alleges is not triable by\nlaw-of-war military commission. See Yamashita, 327 U. S.,\nat 13 (\u201cNeither congressional action nor the military or\nders constituting the commission authorized it to place\npetitioner on trial unless the charge proffered against him\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nare not germane to the analysis.\n   Finally, JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019 assertion that Julius Otto Kuehn\u2019s trial by\nmilitary commission \u201cfor conspiring with Japanese officials to betray\nthe United States fleet to the Imperial Japanese Government prior to\nits attack on Pearl Harbor\u201d stands as authoritative precedent for\nHamdan\u2019s trial by commission, post, at 9, misses the mark in three\ncritical respects. First, Kuehn was tried for the federal espionage\ncrimes under what were then 50 U. S C. \u00a7\u00a731, 32, and 34, not with\ncommon-law violations of the law of war. See Hearings before the Joint\nCommittee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, 79th Cong.,\n1st Sess., pt. 30, pp. 3067\u20133069 (1946). Second, he was tried by martial\nlaw commission (a kind of commission JUSTICE THOMAS acknowledges is\nnot relevant to the analysis here, and whose jurisdiction extends to\noffenses committed within \u201cthe exercise of . . . martial law,\u201d Winthrop\n837, see supra, n. 28), not a commission established exclusively to try\nviolations of the law of war. See ibid. Third, the martial law commis\nsions established to try crimes in Hawaii were ultimately declared\nillegal by this Court. See Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 327 U. S. 304, 324\n(1946) (\u201cThe phrase \u2018martial law\u2019 as employed in [the Hawaiian Organic\nAct], while intended to authorize the military to act vigorously for the\nmaintenance of an orderly civil government and for the defense of the\nIslands against actual or threatened rebellion or invasion, was not in\ntended to authorize the supplanting of courts by military tribunals\u201d).\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

See post, at 16\u201321, and n. 9. There\nare innumerable problems with this approach.\n   First, the crimes JUSTICE THOMAS identifies were not actually\ncharged. It is one thing to observe that charges before a military\ncommission \u201c \u2018need not be stated with the precision of a common law\nindictment,\u2019 \u201d post, at 15, n. 7 (citation omitted); it is quite another to\nsay that a crime not charged may nonetheless be read into an indict\nment. Second, the Government plainly had available to it the tools and\nthe time it needed to charge petitioner with the various crimes JUSTICE\nTHOMAS refers to, if it believed they were supported by the allegations.\nAs JUSTICE THOMAS himself observes, see post, at 21, the crime of aiding\nthe enemy may, in circumstances where the accused owes allegiance to\nthe party whose enemy he is alleged to have aided, be triable by mili\ntary commission pursuant to Article 104 of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. \u00a7904.\nIndeed, the Government has charged detainees under this provision\nwhen it has seen fit to do so. See Brief for David Hicks as Amicus\nCuriae 7.\n   Third, the cases JUSTICE THOMAS relies on to show that Hamdan may\nbe guilty of violations of the law of war not actually charged do not\nsupport his argument. JUSTICE THOMAS begins by blurring the distinc\ntion between those categories of \u201coffender\u201d who may be tried by military\ncommission (e.g., jayhawkers and the like) with the \u201coffenses\u201d that may\nbe so tried. Even when it comes to \u201c \u2018being a guerilla,\u2019 \u201d cf. post, at 18,\nn. 9 (citation omitted), a label alone does not render a person suscepti\nble to execution or other criminal punishment; the charge of \u201c \u2018being a\nguerilla\u2019 \u201d invariably is accompanied by the allegation that the defen\ndant \u201c \u2018took up arms\u2019 \u201d as such. This is because, as explained by Judge\nAdvocate General Holt in a decision upholding the charge of \u201c \u2018being a\nguerilla\u2019 \u201d as one recognized by \u201cthe universal usage of the times,\u201d the\ncharge is simply shorthand (akin to \u201cbeing a spy\u201d) for \u201cthe perpetration\nof a succession of similar acts\u201d of violence. Record Books of the Judge\nAdvocate General Office, R. 3, 590.         The sources cited by JUSTICE\nTHOMAS confirm as much. See cases cited post, at 18, n. 9.\n   Likewise, the suggestion that the Nuremberg precedents support\nHamdan\u2019s conviction for the (uncharged) crime of joining a criminal\norganization must fail. Cf. post, at 19\u201321. The convictions of certain\nhigh-level Nazi officials for \u201cmembership in a criminal organization\u201d\n38                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n   There is no suggestion that Congress has, in exercise of\nits constitutional authority to \u201cdefine and punish . . .\nOffences against the Law of Nations,\u201d U. S. Const., Art. I,\n\u00a78, cl. 10, positively identified \u201cconspiracy\u201d as a war\ncrime.33 As we explained in Quirin, that is not necessarily\nfatal to the Government\u2019s claim of authority to try the\nalleged offense by military commission; Congress, through\nArticle 21 of the UCMJ, has \u201cincorporated by reference\u201d\nthe common law of war, which may render triable by\nmilitary commission certain offenses not defined by stat\nute. 317 U. S., at 30. When, however, neither the ele\nments of the offense nor the range of permissible punish\nments is defined by statute or treaty, the precedent must\nbe plain and unambiguous. To demand any less would be\nto risk concentrating in military hands a degree of adjudi\ncative and punitive power in excess of that contemplated\neither by statute or by the Constitution. Cf.

Tennessee, 532 U. S. 451, 472\u2013\n478 (2001) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). The caution that must be exercised\nin the incremental development of common-law crimes by the judiciary\nis, for the reasons explained in the text, all the more critical when\nreviewing developments that stem from military action.\n40                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\ndefendant by military commission is acknowledged to be\nan offense against the law of war. That burden is far from\nsatisfied here. The crime of \u201cconspiracy\u201d has rarely if ever\nbeen tried as such in this country by any law-of-war mili\ntary commission not exercising some other form of juris\ndiction,35 and does not appear in either the Geneva Con\nventions or the Hague Conventions\u2014the major treaties on\nthe law of war.36 Winthrop explains that under the com\nmon law governing military commissions, it is not enough\nto intend to violate the law of war and commit overt acts\nin furtherance of that intention unless the overt acts\neither are themselves offenses against the law of war or\nconstitute steps sufficiently substantial to qualify as an\nattempt. See Winthrop 841 (\u201c[T]he jurisdiction of the\nmilitary commission should be restricted to cases of of\nfence consisting in overt acts, i.e., in unlawful commissions\nor actual attempts to commit, and not in intentions\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   35 The 19th-century trial of the \u201cLincoln conspirators,\u201d even if prop\n\nerly classified as a trial by law-of-war commission, cf. W. Rehnquist, All\nthe Laws But One: Civil Liberties in Wartime 165\u2013167 (1998) (analyz\ning the conspiracy charges in light of ordinary criminal law principles\nat the time), is at best an equivocal exception. Although the charge\nagainst the defendants in that case accused them of \u201ccombining, con\nfederating, and conspiring together\u201d to murder the President, they were\nalso charged (as we read the indictment, cf. post, at 23, n. 14 (THOMAS,\nJ., dissenting)) with \u201cmaliciously, unlawfully, and traitorously murder\ning the said Abraham Lincoln.\u201d H. R. Doc. No. 314, 55th Cong., 1st\nSess., 696 (1899). Moreover, the Attorney General who wrote the\nopinion defending the trial by military commission treated the charge\nas if it alleged the substantive offense of assassination. See 11 Op.\nAtty. Gen. 297 (1865) (analyzing the propriety of trying by military\ncommission \u201cthe offence of having assassinated the President\u201d); see also\nMudd v. Caldera, 134 F. Supp. 2d 138, 140 (DC 2001).\n   36 By contrast, the Geneva Conventions do extend liability for sub\n\nstantive war crimes to those who \u201corde[r]\u201d their commission, see Third\nGeneva Convention, Art. 129, 6 U. S. T., at 3418, and this Court has\nread the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907 to impose \u201ccommand\nresponsibility\u201d on military commanders for acts of their subordinates,\nsee Yamshita, 327 U.

First, it points out that the Nazi saboteurs in\nQuirin were charged with conspiracy. See Brief for Re\nspondents 27. Second, it observes that Winthrop at one\npoint in his treatise identifies conspiracy as an offense\n\u201cprosecuted by military commissions.\u201d Ibid. (citing Win\nthrop 839, and n. 5). Finally, it notes that another mili\ntary historian, Charles Roscoe Howland, lists conspiracy\n\u201c \u2018to violate the laws of war by destroying life or property\nin aid of the enemy\u2019 \u201d as an offense that was tried as a\nviolation of the law of war during the Civil War. Brief for\nRespondents 27\u201328 (citing C. Howland, Digest of Opinions\nof the Judge Advocates General of the Army 1071 (1912)\n(hereinafter Howland)). On close analysis, however, these\nsources at best lend little support to the Government\u2019s\nposition and at worst undermine it. By any measure, they\nfail to satisfy the high standard of clarity required to\njustify the use of a military commission.\n    That the defendants in Quirin were charged with con\nspiracy is not persuasive, since the Court declined to\naddress whether the offense actually qualified as a viola\ntion of the law of war\u2014let alone one triable by military\ncommission. The Quirin defendants were charged with\nthe following offenses:\n    \u201c[I.] Violation of the law of war. \n\n    \u201c[II.] Violation of Article 81 of the Articles of War, de\n\n    fining the offense of relieving or attempting to relieve, \n\n    or corresponding with or giving intelligence to, the\n\n    enemy.\n\n    \u201c[III.] Violation of Article 82, defining the offense of\n\n    spying.\n\n    \u201c[IV.] Conspiracy to commit the offenses alleged in\n\n    charges [I, II, and III].\u201d 317 U. S., at 23. \n\nThe Government, defending its charge, argued that the\n42                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nconspiracy alleged \u201cconstitute[d] an additional violation of\nthe law of war.\u201d Id., at 15. The saboteurs disagreed; they\nmaintained that \u201c[t]he charge of conspiracy can not stand\nif the other charges fall.\u201d Id., at 8. The Court, however,\ndeclined to resolve the dispute. It concluded, first, that\nthe specification supporting Charge I adequately alleged a\n\u201cviolation of the law of war\u201d that was not \u201cmerely colorable\nor without foundation.\u201d Id., at 36. The facts the Court\ndeemed sufficient for this purpose were that the defen\ndants, admitted enemy combatants, entered upon U. S.\nterritory in time of war without uniform \u201cfor the purpose\nof destroying property used or useful in prosecuting the\nwar.\u201d That act was \u201ca hostile and warlike\u201d one. Id., at 36,\n37. The Court was careful in its decision to identify an\novert, \u201ccomplete\u201d act. Responding to the argument that\nthe saboteurs had \u201cnot actually committed or attempted to\ncommit any act of depredation or entered the theatre or\nzone of active military operations\u201d and therefore had not\nviolated the law of war, the Court responded that they had\nactually \u201cpassed our military and naval lines and defenses\nor went behind those lines, in civilian dress and with\nhostile purpose.\u201d Id., at 38. \u201cThe offense was complete\nwhen with that purpose they entered\u2014or, having so en\ntered, they remained upon\u2014our territory in time of war\nwithout uniform or other appropriate means of identifica\ntion.\u201d Ibid.\n   Turning to the other charges alleged, the Court ex\nplained that \u201c[s]ince the first specification of Charge I sets\nforth a violation of the law of war, we have no occasion to\npass on the adequacy of the second specification of Charge\nI, or to construe the 81st and 82nd Articles of War for the\npurpose of ascertaining whether the specifications under\nCharges II and III allege violations of those Articles or\nwhether if so construed they are constitutional.\u201d Id., at\n46. No mention was made at all of Charge IV\u2014the con\nspiracy charge.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           43\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n  If anything, Quirin supports Hamdan\u2019s argument that\nconspiracy is not a violation of the law of war. Not only\ndid the Court pointedly omit any discussion of the con\nspiracy charge, but its analysis of Charge I placed special\nemphasis on the completion of an offense; it took seriously\nthe saboteurs\u2019 argument that there can be no violation of a\nlaw of war\u2014at least not one triable by military commis\nsion\u2014without the actual commission of or attempt to\ncommit a \u201chostile and warlike act.\u201d Id., at 37\u201338.\n  That limitation makes eminent sense when one consid\ners the necessity from whence this kind of military com\nmission grew: The need to dispense swift justice, often in\nthe form of execution, to illegal belligerents captured on\nthe battlefield. See S. Rep. No. 130, 64th Cong., 1st Sess.,\np. 40 (1916) (testimony of Brig. Gen. Enoch H. Crowder)\n(observing that Article of War 15 preserves the power of\n\u201cthe military commander in the field in time of war\u201d to use\nmilitary commissions (emphasis added)). The same ur\ngency would not have been felt vis-\u00e0-vis enemies who had\ndone little more than agree to violate the laws of war. Cf.\n31 Op. Atty. Gen. 356, 357, 361 (1918) (opining that a\nGerman spy could not be tried by military commission\nbecause, having been apprehended before entering \u201cany\ncamp, fortification or other military premises of the\nUnited States,\u201d he had \u201ccommitted [his offenses] outside of\nthe field of military operations\u201d). The Quirin Court ac\nknowledged as much when it described the President\u2019s\nauthority to use law-of-war military commissions as the\npower to \u201cseize and subject to disciplinary measures those\nenemies who in their attempt to thwart or impede our\nmilitary effort have violated the law of war.\u201d 317 U. S., at\n28\u201329 (emphasis added).\n  Winthrop and Howland are only superficially more\nhelpful to the Government. Howland, granted, lists \u201ccon\nspiracy by two or more to violate the laws of war by de\nstroying life or property in aid of the enemy\u201d as one of over\n44                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n20 \u201coffenses against the laws and usages of war\u201d \u201cpassed\nupon and punished by military commissions.\u201d Howland\n1071. But while the records of cases that Howland cites\nfollowing his list of offenses against the law of war support\ninclusion of the other offenses mentioned, they provide no\nsupport for the inclusion of conspiracy as a violation of the\nlaw of war. See ibid. (citing Record Books of the Judge\nAdvocate General Office, R. 2, 144; R. 3, 401, 589, 649; R.\n4, 320; R. 5, 36, 590; R. 6, 20; R. 7, 413; R. 8, 529; R. 9,\n149, 202, 225, 481, 524, 535; R. 10, 567; R. 11, 473, 513; R.\n13, 125, 675; R. 16, 446; R. 21, 101, 280). Winthrop, ap\nparently recognizing as much, excludes conspiracy of any\nkind from his own list of offenses against the law of war.\nSee Winthrop 839\u2013840.\n   Winthrop does, unsurprisingly, include \u201ccriminal con\nspiracies\u201d in his list of \u201c[c]rimes and statutory offenses\ncognizable by State or U. S. courts\u201d and triable by martial\nlaw or military government commission. See id., at 839.\nAnd, in a footnote, he cites several Civil War examples of\n\u201cconspiracies of this class, or of the first and second classes\ncombined.\u201d Id., at 839, n. 5 (emphasis added). The Gov\nernment relies on this footnote for its contention that\nconspiracy was triable both as an ordinary crime (a crime\nof the \u201cfirst class\u201d) and, independently, as a war crime (a\ncrime of the \u201csecond class\u201d). But the footnote will not\nsupport the weight the Government places on it.\n   As we have seen, the military commissions convened\nduring the Civil War functioned at once as martial law or\nmilitary government tribunals and as law-of-war commis\nsions. See n. 27, supra. Accordingly, they regularly tried\nwar crimes and ordinary crimes together. Indeed, as\nHowland observes, \u201c[n]ot infrequently the crime, as\ncharged and found, was a combination of the two species of\noffenses.\u201d Howland 1071; see also Davis 310, n. 2; Win\nthrop 842. The example he gives is \u201c \u2018murder in violation\nof the laws of war.\u2019 \u201d Howland 1071\u20131072. Winthrop\u2019s\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

It is not a stand-alone\noffense against the law of war. Winthrop confirms this\nunderstanding later in his discussion, when he empha\nsizes that \u201covert acts\u201d constituting war crimes are the only\nproper subject at least of those military tribunals not\nconvened to stand in for local courts. Winthrop 841, and\nnn. 22, 23 (emphasis in original) (citing W. Finlason,\nMartial Law 130 (1867)).\n   JUSTICE THOMAS cites as evidence that conspiracy is a\nrecognized violation of the law of war the Civil War in\ndictment against Henry Wirz, which charged the defen\ndant with \u201c \u2018[m]aliciously, willfully, and traitorously . . .\ncombining, confederating, and conspiring [with others] to\ninjure the health and destroy the lives of soldiers in the\nmilitary service of the United States . . . to the end that\nthe armies of the United States might be weakened and\nimpaired, in violation of the laws and customs of war.\u2019 \u201d\nPost, at 24\u201325 (dissenting opinion) (quoting H. R. Doc. No.\n314, 55th Cong., 3d Sess., 785 (1865); emphasis deleted).\nAs shown by the specification supporting that charge,\nhowever, Wirz was alleged to have personally committed a\nnumber of atrocities against his victims, including torture,\ninjection of prisoners with poison, and use of \u201cferocious\nand bloodthirsty dogs\u201d to \u201cseize, tear, mangle, and maim\nthe bodies and limbs\u201d of prisoners, many of whom died as\na result. Id., at 789\u2013790. Crucially, Judge Advocate\nGeneral Holt determined that one of Wirz\u2019s alleged co\nconspirators, R. B. Winder, should not be tried by military\ncommission because there was as yet insufficient evidence\nof his own personal involvement in the atrocities: \u201c[I]n the\ncase of R. B. Winder, while the evidence at the trial of Wirz\nwas deemed by the court to implicate him in the conspiracy\nagainst the lives of all Federal prisoners in rebel hands, no\n46                     HAMDAN v.

And the only \u201cconspiracy\u201d\ncrimes that have been recognized by international war\ncrimes tribunals (whose jurisdiction often extends beyond\nwar crimes proper to crimes against humanity and crimes\nagainst the peace) are conspiracy to commit genocide and\ncommon plan to wage aggressive war, which is a crime\nagainst the peace and requires for its commission actual\nparticipation in a \u201cconcrete plan to wage war.\u201d 1 Trial of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   37 The other examples JUSTICE THOMAS offers are no more availing.\n\nThe Civil War indictment against Robert Louden, cited post, at 25,\nalleged a conspiracy, but not one in violation of the law of war. See War\nDept., General Court Martial Order No. 41, p. 20 (1864). A separate\ncharge of \u201c \u2018[t]ransgression of the laws and customs of war\u2019 \u201d made no\nmention of conspiracy. Id., at 17. The charge against Lenger Grenfel\nand others for conspiring to release rebel prisoners held in Chicago only\nsupports the observation, made in the text, that the Civil War tribunals\noften charged hybrid crimes mixing elements of crimes ordinarily\ntriable in civilian courts (like treason) and violations of the law of war.\nJudge Advocate General Holt, in recommending that Grenfel\u2019s death\nsentence be upheld (it was in fact commuted by Presidential decree, see\nH. R. Doc. No. 314, at 725), explained that the accused \u201cunited himself\nwith traitors and malefactors for the overthrow of our Republic in the\ninterest of slavery.\u201d Id., at 689.\n   38 The Court in Quirin \u201cassume[d] that there are acts regarded in\n\nother countries, or by some writers on international law, as offenses\nagainst the law of war which would not be triable by military tribunal\nhere, either because they are not recognized by our courts as violations\nof the law of war or because they are of that class of offenses constitu\ntionally triable only by a jury.\u201d 317 U. S., at 29. We need not test the\nvalidity of that assumption here because the international sources only\ncorroborate the domestic ones.\n                    Cite as: 548 U.

The International Military Tribunal\nat Nuremberg, over the prosecution\u2019s objections, pointedly\nrefused to recognize as a violation of the law of war con\nspiracy to commit war crimes, see, e.g., 22 id., at 469,39\nand convicted only Hitler\u2019s most senior associates of con\nspiracy to wage aggressive war, see S. Pomorski, Conspir\nacy and Criminal Organization, in the Nuremberg Trial\nand International Law 213, 233\u2013235 (G. Ginsburgs & V.\nKudriavtsev eds. 1990). As one prominent figure from the\nNuremberg trials has explained, members of the Tribunal\nobjected to recognition of conspiracy as a violation of the\nlaw of war on the ground that \u201c[t]he Anglo-American\nconcept of conspiracy was not part of European legal\nsystems and arguably not an element of the internation\nally recognized laws of war.\u201d T. Taylor, Anatomy of the\nNuremberg Trials: A Personal Memoir 36 (1992); see also\nid., at 550 (observing that Francis Biddle, who as Attorney\nGeneral prosecuted the defendants in Quirin, thought the\nFrench judge had made a \u201c \u2018persuasive argument that\nconspiracy in the truest sense is not known to interna\ntional law\u2019 \u201d).40\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  39 Accordingly,    the Tribunal determined to \u201cdisregard the\ncharges . . . that the defendants conspired to commit War Crimes and\nCrimes against Humanity.\u201d 22 Trial of the Major War Criminals\nBefore the International Military Tribunal 469 (1947); see also ibid.\n(\u201c[T]he Charter does not define as a separate crime any conspiracy\nexcept the one to commit acts of aggressive war\u201d).\n   40 See also 15 United Nations War Crimes Commissions, Law Reports\n\nof Trials of War Criminals 90\u201391 (1949) (observing that, although a few\nindividuals were charged with conspiracy under European domestic\ncriminal codes following World War II, \u201cthe United States Military\nTribunals\u201d established at that time did not \u201crecognis[e] as a separate\noffence conspiracy to commit war crimes or crimes against humanity\u201d).\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY),\ndrawing on the Nuremberg precedents, has adopted a \u201cjoint criminal\n48                     HAMDAN v.

Far from making the\nrequisite substantial showing, the Government has failed\neven to offer a \u201cmerely colorable\u201d case for inclusion of\nconspiracy among those offenses cognizable by law-of-war\nmilitary commission. Cf. Quirin, 317 U. S., at 36. Be\ncause the charge does not support the commission\u2019s juris\ndiction, the commission lacks authority to try Hamdan.\n   The charge\u2019s shortcomings are not merely formal, but\nare indicative of a broader inability on the Executive\u2019s part\nhere to satisfy the most basic precondition\u2014at least in the\nabsence of specific congressional authorization\u2014for estab\nlishment of military commissions: military necessity.\nHamdan\u2019s tribunal was appointed not by a military com\nmander in the field of battle, but by a retired major gen\neral stationed away from any active hostilities. Cf. Rasul\nv. Bush, 542 U. S., at 487 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in\njudgment) (observing that \u201cGuantanamo Bay is . . . far\nremoved from any hostilities\u201d). Hamdan is charged not\nwith an overt act for which he was caught redhanded in a\ntheater of war and which military efficiency demands be\ntried expeditiously, but with an agreement the inception of\nwhich long predated the attacks of September 11, 2001\nand the AUMF. That may well be a crime,41 but it is not\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nenterprise\u201d theory of liability, but that is a species of liability for the\nsubstantive offense (akin to aiding and abetting), not a crime on its\nown.

None of the\novert acts alleged to have been committed in furtherance\nof the agreement is itself a war crime, or even necessarily\noccurred during time of, or in a theater of, war. Any ur\ngent need for imposition or execution of judgment is ut\nterly belied by the record; Hamdan was arrested in No\nvember 2001 and he was not charged until mid-2004.\nThese simply are not the circumstances in which, by any\nstretch of the historical evidence or this Court\u2019s prece\ndents, a military commission established by Executive\nOrder under the authority of Article 21 of the UCMJ may\nlawfully try a person and subject him to punishment.\n                              VI\n   Whether or not the Government has charged Hamdan\nwith an offense against the law of war cognizable by mili\ntary commission, the commission lacks power to proceed.\nThe UCMJ conditions the President\u2019s use of military\ncommissions on compliance not only with the American\ncommon law of war, but also with the rest of the UCMJ\nitself, insofar as applicable, and with the \u201crules and pre\ncepts of the law of nations,\u201d Quirin, 317 U. S., at 28\u2014\nincluding, inter alia, the four Geneva Conventions signed\nin 1949. See Yamashita, 327 U. S., at 20\u201321, 23\u201324. The\nprocedures that the Government has decreed will govern\nHamdan\u2019s trial by commission violate these laws.\n                          A\n  The commission\u2019s procedures are set forth in Commis\nsion Order No. 1, which was amended most recently on\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nterrorism is therefore wide of the mark. See post, at 8, n. 3; 28\u201330.\n\nThat conspiracy is not a violation of the law of war triable by military\n\ncommission does not mean the Government may not, for example,\n\nprosecute by court-martial or in federal court those caught \u201cplotting\n\nterrorist atrocities like the bombing of the Khobar Towers.\u201d Post, at 29. \n\n50                   HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nAugust 31, 2005\u2014after Hamdan\u2019s trial had already begun.\nEvery commission established pursuant to Commission\nOrder No. 1 must have a presiding officer and at least\nthree other members, all of whom must be commissioned\nofficers. \u00a74(A)(1). The presiding officer\u2019s job is to rule on\nquestions of law and other evidentiary and interlocutory\nissues; the other members make findings and, if applica\nble, sentencing decisions. \u00a74(A)(5). The accused is enti\ntled to appointed military counsel and may hire civilian\ncounsel at his own expense so long as such counsel is a\nU. S. citizen with security clearance \u201cat the level SECRET\nor higher.\u201d \u00a7\u00a74(C)(2)\u2013(3).\n   The accused also is entitled to a copy of the charge(s)\nagainst him, both in English and his own language (if\ndifferent), to a presumption of innocence, and to certain\nother rights typically afforded criminal defendants in\ncivilian courts and courts-martial. See \u00a7\u00a75(A)\u2013(P). These\nrights are subject, however, to one glaring condition: The\naccused and his civilian counsel may be excluded from,\nand precluded from ever learning what evidence was\npresented during, any part of the proceeding that either\nthe Appointing Authority or the presiding officer decides\nto \u201cclose.\u201d Grounds for such closure \u201cinclude the protec\ntion of information classified or classifiable . . . ; informa\ntion protected by law or rule from unauthorized disclosure;\nthe physical safety of participants in Commission proceed\nings, including prospective witnesses; intelligence and law\nenforcement sources, methods, or activities; and other\nnational security interests.\u201d \u00a76(B)(3).42 Appointed mili\ntary defense counsel must be privy to these closed ses\nsions, but may, at the presiding officer\u2019s discretion, be\nforbidden to reveal to his or her client what took place\ntherein. Ibid.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  42 The accused also may be excluded from the proceedings if he \u201cen\n\ngages in disruptive conduct.\u201d \u00a75(K).\n                    Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                  51\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  Another striking feature of the rules governing Ham\ndan\u2019s commission is that they permit the admission of any\nevidence that, in the opinion of the presiding officer,\n\u201cwould have probative value to a reasonable person.\u201d\n\u00a76(D)(1). Under this test, not only is testimonial hearsay\nand evidence obtained through coercion fully admissible,\nbut neither live testimony nor witnesses\u2019 written state\nments need be sworn. See \u00a7\u00a76(D)(2)(b), (3). Moreover, the\naccused and his civilian counsel may be denied access to\nevidence in the form of \u201cprotected information\u201d (which\nincludes classified information as well as \u201cinformation\nprotected by law or rule from unauthorized disclosure\u201d and\n\u201cinformation concerning other national security interests,\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a76(B)(3), 6(D)(5)(a)(v)), so long as the presiding officer\nconcludes that the evidence is \u201cprobative\u201d under \u00a76(D)(1)\nand that its admission without the accused\u2019s knowledge\nwould not \u201cresult in the denial of a full and fair trial.\u201d\n\u00a76(D)(5)(b).43 Finally, a presiding officer\u2019s determination\nthat evidence \u201cwould not have probative value to a rea\nsonable person\u201d may be overridden by a majority of the\nother commission members. \u00a76(D)(1).\n  Once all the evidence is in, the commission members (not\nincluding the presiding officer) must vote on the accused\u2019s\nguilt. A two-thirds vote will suffice for both a verdict of\nguilty and for imposition of any sentence not including\ndeath (the imposition of which requires a unanimous vote).\n\u00a76(F). Any appeal is taken to a three-member review\npanel composed of military officers and designated by the\nSecretary of Defense, only one member of which need have\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  43 As the District Court observed, this section apparently permits\n\nreception of testimony from a confidential informant in circumstances\nwhere \u201cHamdan will not be permitted to hear the testimony, see the\nwitness\u2019s face, or learn his name. If the government has information\ndeveloped by interrogation of witnesses in Afghanistan or elsewhere, it\ncan offer such evidence in transcript form, or even as summaries of\ntranscripts.\u201d 344 F. Supp. 2d 152, 168 (DC 2004).\n52                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexperience as a judge. \u00a76(H)(4). The review panel is\ndirected to \u201cdisregard any variance from procedures speci\nfied in this Order or elsewhere that would not materially\nhave affected the outcome of the trial before the Commis\nsion.\u201d Ibid. Once the panel makes its recommendation to\nthe Secretary of Defense, the Secretary can either remand\nfor further proceedings or forward the record to the Presi\ndent with his recommendation as to final disposition.\n\u00a76(H)(5). The President then, unless he has delegated the\ntask to the Secretary, makes the \u201cfinal decision.\u201d \u00a76(H)(6).\nHe may change the commission\u2019s findings or sentence only\nin a manner favorable to the accused. Ibid.\n                              B\n   Hamdan raises both general and particular objections to\nthe procedures set forth in Commission Order No. 1. His\ngeneral objection is that the procedures\u2019 admitted devia\ntion from those governing courts-martial itself renders the\ncommission illegal. Chief among his particular objections\nare that he may, under the Commission Order, be con\nvicted based on evidence he has not seen or heard, and\nthat any evidence admitted against him need not comply\nwith the admissibility or relevance rules typically applica\nble in criminal trials and court-martial proceedings.\n   The Government objects to our consideration of any\nprocedural challenge at this stage on the grounds that (1)\nthe abstention doctrine espoused in Councilman, 420 U. S.\n738, precludes pre-enforcement review of procedural rules,\n(2) Hamdan will be able to raise any such challenge follow\ning a \u201cfinal decision\u201d under the DTA, and (3) \u201cthere is . . .\nno basis to presume, before the trial has even commenced,\nthat the trial will not be conducted in good faith and ac\ncording to law.\u201d Brief for Respondents 45\u201346, nn. 20\u201321.\nThe first of these contentions was disposed of in Part III,\nsupra, and neither of the latter two is sound.\n   First, because Hamdan apparently is not subject to the\n                    Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                 53\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ndeath penalty (at least as matters now stand) and may\nreceive a sentence shorter than 10 years\u2019 imprisonment,\nhe has no automatic right to review of the commission\u2019s\n\u201cfinal decision\u201d44 before a federal court under the DTA.\nSee \u00a71005(e)(3), 119 Stat. 2743. Second, contrary to the\nGovernment\u2019s assertion, there is a \u201cbasis to presume\u201d that\nthe procedures employed during Hamdan\u2019s trial will vio\nlate the law: The procedures are described with particular\nity in Commission Order No. 1, and implementation of\nsome of them has already occurred. One of Hamdan\u2019s\ncomplaints is that he will be, and indeed already has been,\nexcluded from his own trial. See Reply Brief for Petitioner\n12; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a. Under these circumstances,\nreview of the procedures in advance of a \u201cfinal decision\u201d\u2014\nthe timing of which is left entirely to the discretion of the\nPresident under the DTA\u2014is appropriate. We turn, then,\nto consider the merits of Hamdan\u2019s procedural challenge.\n                              C\n  In part because the difference between military commis\nsions and courts-martial originally was a difference of\njurisdiction alone, and in part to protect against abuse and\nensure evenhandedness under the pressures of war, the\nprocedures governing trials by military commission his\ntorically have been the same as those governing courts-\nmartial. See, e.g., 1 The War of the Rebellion 248 (2d\nseries 1894) (General Order 1 issued during the Civil War\nrequired military commissions to \u201cbe constituted in a\nsimilar manner and their proceedings be conducted ac\ncording to the same general rules as courts-martial in\norder to prevent abuses which might otherwise arise\u201d).\nAccounts of commentators from Winthrop through Gen\neral Crowder\u2014who drafted Article of War 15 and whose\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  44 Any decision of the commission is not \u201cfinal\u201d until the President\n\nrenders it so. See Commission Order No. 1 \u00a76(H)(6).\n54                    HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nviews have been deemed \u201cauthoritative\u201d by this Court,\nMadsen, 343 U. S., at 353\u2014confirm as much.45 As re\ncently as the Korean and Vietnam wars, during which use\nof military commissions was contemplated but never\nmade, the principle of procedural parity was espoused as a\nbackground assumption. See Paust, Antiterrorism Mili\ntary Commissions: Courting Illegality, 23 Mich. J. Int\u2019l L.\n1, 3\u20135 (2001\u20132002).\n   There is a glaring historical exception to this general\nrule. The procedures and evidentiary rules used to try\nGeneral Yamashita near the end of World War II deviated\nin significant respects from those then governing courts-\nmartial. See 327 U. S. 1. The force of that precedent,\nhowever, has been seriously undermined by post-World\nWar II developments.\n   Yamashita, from late 1944 until September 1945, was\nCommanding General of the Fourteenth Army Group of\nthe Imperial Japanese Army, which had exercised control\nover the Philippine Islands. On September 3, 1945, after\nAmerican forces regained control of the Philippines, Ya\nmashita surrendered. Three weeks later, he was charged\nwith violations of the law of war. A few weeks after that,\nhe was arraigned before a military commission convened\nin the Philippines. He pleaded not guilty, and his trial\nlasted for two months. On December 7, 1945, Yamashita\nwas convicted and sentenced to hang. See id., at 5; id., at\n31\u201334 (Murphy, J., dissenting). This Court upheld the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  45 See Winthrop 835, and n. 81 (\u201cmilitary commissions are constituted\n\nand composed, and their proceedings are conducted, similarly to gen\neral courts-martial\u201d); id., at 841\u2013842; S.

See\nid., at 41\u201381 (Rutledge, J., joined by Murphy, J., dissent\ning).46 Among the dissenters\u2019 primary concerns was that\nthe commission had free rein to consider all evidence\n\u201cwhich in the commission\u2019s opinion \u2018would be of assistance\nin proving or disproving the charge,\u2019 without any of the\nusual modes of authentication.\u201d Id., at 49 (Rutledge, J.).\n  The majority, however, did not pass on the merits of\nYamashita\u2019s procedural challenges because it concluded\nthat his status disentitled him to any protection under the\nArticles of War (specifically, those set forth in Article 38,\nwhich would become Article 36 of the UCMJ) or the Ge\nneva Convention of 1929, 47 Stat. 2021 (1929 Geneva\nConvention). The Court explained that Yamashita was\nneither a \u201cperson made subject to the Articles of War by\nArticle 2\u201d thereof, 327 U. S., at 20, nor a protected pris\noner of war being tried for crimes committed during his\ndetention, id., at 21.\n  At least partially in response to subsequent criticism of\nGeneral Yamashita\u2019s trial, the UCMJ\u2019s codification of the\nArticles of War after World War II expanded the category\nof persons subject thereto to include defendants in Yama\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  46 The  dissenters\u2019 views are summarized in the following passage:\n   \u201cIt is outside our basic scheme to condemn men without giving\nreasonable opportunity for preparing defense; in capital or other\nserious crimes to convict on \u2018official documents . . .; affidavits; . . .\ndocuments or translations thereof; diaries . . ., photographs, motion\npicture films, and . . . newspapers\u201d or on hearsay, once, twice or thrice\nremoved, more particularly when the documentary evidence or some of\nit is prepared ex parte by the prosecuting authority and includes not\nonly opinion but conclusions of guilt. Nor in such cases do we deny the\nrights of confrontation of witnesses and cross-examination.\u201d Yama\nshita, 327 U. S., at 44 (footnotes omitted).\n56                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nshita\u2019s (and Hamdan\u2019s) position,47 and the Third Geneva\nConvention of 1949 extended prisoner-of-war protections\nto individuals tried for crimes committed before their\ncapture. See 3 Int\u2019l Comm. of Red Cross,48 Commentary:\nGeneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners\nof War 413 (1960) (hereinafter GCIII Commentary) (ex\nplaining that Article 85, which extends the Convention\u2019s\nprotections to \u201c[p]risoners of war prosecuted under the\nlaws of the Detaining Power for acts committed prior to\ncapture,\u201d was adopted in response to judicial interpreta\ntions of the 1929 Convention, including this Court\u2019s deci\nsion in Yamashita). The most notorious exception to the\nprinciple of uniformity, then, has been stripped of its\nprecedential value.\n   The uniformity principle is not an inflexible one; it does\nnot preclude all departures from the procedures dictated\nfor use by courts-martial. But any departure must be\ntailored to the exigency that necessitates it. See Winthrop\n835, n. 81. That understanding is reflected in Article 36 of\nthe UCMJ, which provides:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  47 Article2 of the UCMJ now reads:\n  \u201c(a) The following persons are subject to [the UCMJ]:\n  \u201c(9) Prisoners of war in custody of the armed forces.\n   \u201c(12) Subject to any treaty or agreement to which the United States is\nor may be a party or to any accepted rule of international law, persons\nwithin an area leased by or otherwise reserved or acquired for the use\nof the United States which is under the control of the Secretary con\ncerned and which is outside the United States and outside the Com\nmonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands.\u201d 10 U.

S. ____ (2006)          57\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n      \u201c(a) The procedure, including modes of proof, in\n    cases before courts-martial, courts of inquiry, military\n    commissions, and other military tribunals may be\n    prescribed by the President by regulations which\n    shall, so far as he considers practicable, apply the\n    principles of law and the rules of evidence generally\n    recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United\n    States district courts, but which may not be contrary\n    to or inconsistent with this chapter.\n      \u201c(b) All rules and regulations made under this arti\n    cle shall be uniform insofar as practicable and shall be\n    reported to Congress.\u201d 70A Stat. 50.\n  Article 36 places two restrictions on the President\u2019s\npower to promulgate rules of procedure for courts-martial\nand military commissions alike. First, no procedural rule\nhe adopts may be \u201ccontrary to or inconsistent with\u201d the\nUCMJ\u2014however practical it may seem. Second, the rules\nadopted must be \u201cuniform insofar as practicable.\u201d That is,\nthe rules applied to military commissions must be the\nsame as those applied to courts-martial unless such uni\nformity proves impracticable.\n  Hamdan argues that Commission Order No. 1 violates\nboth of these restrictions; he maintains that the proce\ndures described in the Commission Order are inconsistent\nwith the UCMJ and that the Government has offered no\nexplanation for their deviation from the procedures gov\nerning courts-martial, which are set forth in the Manual\nfor Courts-Martial, United States (2005 ed.) (Manual for\nCourts-Martial).    Among the inconsistencies Hamdan\nidentifies is that between \u00a76 of the Commission Order,\nwhich permits exclusion of the accused from proceedings\nand denial of his access to evidence in certain circum\nstances, and the UCMJ\u2019s requirement that \u201c[a]ll . . . pro\nceedings\u201d other than votes and deliberations by courts-\nmartial \u201cshall be made a part of the record and shall be in\n58                     HAMDAN v.

Hamdan also observes that the Commission Order\ndispenses with virtually all evidentiary rules applicable in\ncourts-martial.\n  The Government has three responses. First, it argues,\nonly 9 of the UCMJ\u2019s 158 Articles\u2014the ones that expressly\nmention \u201cmilitary commissions\u201d49\u2014actually apply to com\nmissions, and Commission Order No. 1 sets forth no pro\ncedure that is \u201ccontrary to or inconsistent with\u201d those 9\nprovisions. Second, the Government contends, military\ncommissions would be of no use if the President were\nhamstrung by those provisions of the UCMJ that govern\ncourts-martial. Finally, the President\u2019s determination\nthat \u201cthe danger to the safety of the United States and the\nnature of international terrorism\u201d renders it impracticable\n\u201cto apply in military commissions . . . the principles of law\nand rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of\ncriminal cases in the United States district courts,\u201d No\nvember 13 Order \u00a71(f), is, in the Government\u2019s view, ex\nplanation enough for any deviation from court-martial\nprocedures.

S. ____ (2006)                    59\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Hamdan has the better of this argument. Without\nreaching the question whether any provision of Commis\nsion Order No. 1 is strictly \u201ccontrary to or inconsistent\nwith\u201d other provisions of the UCMJ, we conclude that the\n\u201cpracticability\u201d determination the President has made is\ninsufficient to justify variances from the procedures gov\nerning courts-martial. Subsection (b) of Article 36 was\nadded after World War II, and requires a different show\ning of impracticability from the one required by subsection\n(a). Subsection (a) requires that the rules the President\npromulgates for courts-martial, provost courts, and mili\ntary commissions alike conform to those that govern pro\ncedures in Article III courts, \u201cso far as he considers practi\ncable.\u201d 10 U. S. C. \u00a7836(a) (emphasis added). Subsection\n(b), by contrast, demands that the rules applied in courts-\nmartial, provost courts, and military commissions\u2014\nwhether or not they conform with the Federal Rules of\nEvidence\u2014be \u201cuniform insofar as practicable.\u201d \u00a7836(b)\n(emphasis added). Under the latter provision, then, the\nrules set forth in the Manual for Courts-Martial must\napply to military commissions unless impracticable.50\n   The President here has determined, pursuant to subsec\ntion (a), that it is impracticable to apply the rules and\nprinciples of law that govern \u201cthe trial of criminal cases in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   50 JUSTICE THOMAS relies on the legislative history of the UCMJ to\n\nargue that Congress\u2019 adoption of Article 36(b) in the wake of World War\nII was \u201cmotivated\u201d solely by a desire for \u201cuniformity across the separate\nbranches of the armed services.\u201d Post, at 35. But even if Congress was\nconcerned with ensuring uniformity across service branches, that does\nnot mean it did not also intend to codify the longstanding practice of\nprocedural parity between courts-martial and other military tribunals.\nIndeed, the suggestion that Congress did not intend uniformity across\ntribunal types is belied by the textual proximity of subsection (a) (which\nrequires that the rules governing criminal trials in federal district\ncourts apply, absent the President\u2019s determination of impracticability,\nto courts-martial, provost courts, and military commissions alike) and\nsubsection (b) (which imposes the uniformity requirement).\n60                    HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe United States district courts,\u201d \u00a7836(a), to Hamdan\u2019s\ncommission. We assume that complete deference is owed\nthat determination. The President has not, however,\nmade a similar official determination that it is impractica\nble to apply the rules for courts-martial.51 And even if\nsubsection (b)\u2019s requirements may be satisfied without\nsuch an official determination, the requirements of that\nsubsection are not satisfied here.\n  Nothing in the record before us demonstrates that it\nwould be impracticable to apply court-martial rules in this\ncase. There is no suggestion, for example, of any logistical\ndifficulty in securing properly sworn and authenticated\nevidence or in applying the usual principles of relevance\nand admissibility. Assuming arguendo that the reasons\narticulated in the President\u2019s Article 36(a) determination\nought to be considered in evaluating the impracticability\nof applying court-martial rules, the only reason offered in\nsupport of that determination is the danger posed by\ninternational terrorism.52 Without for one moment under\nestimating that danger, it is not evident to us why it\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  51 We  may assume that such a determination would be entitled to a\nmeasure of deference. For the reasons given by JUSTICE KENNEDY, see\npost, at 5 (opinion concurring in part), however, the level of deference\naccorded to a determination made under subsection (b) presum\nably would not be as high as that accorded to a determination under\nsubsection (a).\n  52 JUSTICE THOMAS looks not to the President\u2019s official Article 36(a)\n\ndetermination, but instead to press statements made by the Secretary\nof Defense and the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. See post, at\n36\u201338 (dissenting opinion). We have not heretofore, in evaluating the\nlegality of Executive action, deferred to comments made by such offi\ncials to the media. Moreover, the only additional reason the comments\nprovide\u2014aside from the general danger posed by international terror\nism\u2014for departures from court-martial procedures is the need to\nprotect classified information. As we explain in the text, and as\nJUSTICE KENNEDY elaborates in his separate opinion, the structural and\nprocedural defects of Hamdan\u2019s commission extend far beyond rules\npreventing access to classified information.\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)               61\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nshould require, in the case of Hamdan\u2019s trial, any variance\nfrom the rules that govern courts-martial.\n   The absence of any showing of impracticability is par\nticularly disturbing when considered in light of the clear\nand admitted failure to apply one of the most fundamental\nprotections afforded not just by the Manual for Courts-\nMartial but also by the UCMJ itself: the right to be pre\nsent. See 10 U. S. C. A. \u00a7839(c) (Supp. 2006). Whether or\nnot that departure technically is \u201ccontrary to or inconsis\ntent with\u201d the terms of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. \u00a7836(a), the\njettisoning of so basic a right cannot lightly be excused as\n\u201cpracticable.\u201d\n   Under the circumstances, then, the rules applicable in\ncourts-martial must apply. Since it is undisputed that\nCommission Order No. 1 deviates in many significant\nrespects from those rules, it necessarily violates Article\n36(b).\n   The Government\u2019s objection that requiring compliance\nwith the court-martial rules imposes an undue burden\nboth ignores the plain meaning of Article 36(b) and mis\nunderstands the purpose and the history of military com\nmissions. The military commission was not born of a\ndesire to dispense a more summary form of justice than is\nafforded by courts-martial; it developed, rather, as a tri\nbunal of necessity to be employed when courts-martial\nlacked jurisdiction over either the accused or the subject\nmatter. See Winthrop 831. Exigency lent the commission\nits legitimacy, but did not further justify the wholesale\njettisoning of procedural protections. That history ex\nplains why the military commission\u2019s procedures typically\nhave been the ones used by courts-martial. That the\njurisdiction of the two tribunals today may sometimes\noverlap, see Madsen, 343 U. S., at 354, does not detract\nfrom the force of this history;53 Article 21 did not trans\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 53 JUSTICE   THOMAS relies extensively on Madsen for the proposition\n62                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nform the military commission from a tribunal of true\nexigency into a more convenient adjudicatory tool. Article\n36, confirming as much, strikes a careful balance between\nuniform procedure and the need to accommodate exigen\ncies that may sometimes arise in a theater of war. That\nArticle not having been complied with here, the rules\nspecified for Hamdan\u2019s trial are illegal.54\n                             D\n  The procedures adopted to try Hamdan also violate the\nGeneva Conventions. The Court of Appeals dismissed\nHamdan\u2019s Geneva Convention challenge on three inde\npendent grounds: (1) the Geneva Conventions are not judi\ncially enforceable; (2) Hamdan in any event is not entitled\nto their protections; and (3) even if he is entitled to their\nprotections, Councilman abstention is appropriate. Judge\nWilliams, concurring, rejected the second ground but\nagreed with the majority respecting the first and the last.\nAs we explained in Part III, supra, the abstention rule\napplied in Councilman, 420 U. S. 738, is not applicable\nhere.55 And for the reasons that follow, we hold that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthat the President has free rein to set the procedures that govern\nmilitary commissions. See post, at 30, 31, 33, n. 16, 34, and 45. That\nreliance is misplaced. Not only did Madsen not involve a law-of-war\nmilitary commission, but (1) the petitioner there did not challenge the\nprocedures used to try her, (2) the UCMJ, with its new Article 36(b),\ndid not become effective until May 31, 1951, after the petitioner\u2019s trial,\nsee 343 U. S., at 345, n. 6, and (3) the procedures used to try the peti\ntioner actually afforded more protection than those used in courts-\nmartial, see id., at 358\u2013360; see also id., at 358 (\u201c[T]he Military Gov\nernment Courts for Germany . . . have had a less military character\nthan that of courts-martial\u201d).\n   54 Prior to the enactment of Article 36(b), it may well have been the\n\ncase that a deviation from the rules governing courts-martial would not\nhave rendered the military commission \u201c \u2018illegal.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 30\u201331, n. 16\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting Winthrop 841).

S. ____ (2006)                  63\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nneither of the other grounds the Court of Appeals gave for\nits decision is persuasive.\n                              i\n   The Court of Appeals relied on Johnson v. Eisentrager,\n339 U. S. 763 (1950), to hold that Hamdan could not in\nvoke the Geneva Conventions to challenge the Govern\nment\u2019s plan to prosecute him in accordance with Commis\nsion Order No. 1. Eisentrager involved a challenge by 21\nGerman nationals to their 1945 convictions for war crimes\nby a military tribunal convened in Nanking, China, and to\ntheir subsequent imprisonment in occupied Germany. The\npetitioners argued, inter alia, that the 1929 Geneva Con\nvention rendered illegal some of the procedures employed\nduring their trials, which they said deviated impermissi\nbly from the procedures used by courts-martial to try\nAmerican soldiers. See id., at 789. We rejected that claim\non the merits because the petitioners (unlike Hamdan\nhere) had failed to identify any prejudicial disparity \u201cbe\ntween the Commission that tried [them] and those that\nwould try an offending soldier of the American forces of\nlike rank,\u201d and in any event could claim no protection,\nunder the 1929 Convention, during trials for crimes that\noccurred before their confinement as prisoners of war. Id.,\nat 790.56\n   Buried in a footnote of the opinion, however, is this\ncurious statement suggesting that the Court lacked power\neven to consider the merits of the Geneva Convention\nargument:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nGeneva Convention challenge is not yet \u201cripe\u201d because he has yet to be\nsentenced. See post, at 43\u201345. This is really just a species of the\nabstention argument we have already rejected. See Part III, supra.\nThe text of the Geneva Conventions does not direct an accused to wait\nuntil sentence is imposed to challenge the legality of the tribunal that\nis to try him.\n   56 As explained in Part VI\u2013C, supra, that is no longer true under the\n\n1949 Conventions.\n64                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n     \u201cWe are not holding that these prisoners have no right\n     which the military authorities are bound to respect.\n     The United States, by the Geneva Convention of July\n     27, 1929, 47 Stat. 2021, concluded with forty-six other\n     countries, including the German Reich, an agreement\n     upon the treatment to be accorded captives. These\n     prisoners claim to be and are entitled to its protection.\n     It is, however, the obvious scheme of the Agreement\n     that responsibility for observance and enforcement of\n     these rights is upon political and military authorities.\n     Rights of alien enemies are vindicated under it only\n     through protests and intervention of protecting pow\n     ers as the rights of our citizens against foreign gov\n     ernments are vindicated only by Presidential inter\n     vention.\u201d Id., at 789, n. 14.\nThe Court of Appeals, on the strength of this footnote, held\nthat \u201cthe 1949 Geneva Convention does not confer upon\nHamdan a right to enforce its provisions in court.\u201d 415\nF. 3d, at 40.\n  Whatever else might be said about the Eisentrager\nfootnote, it does not control this case. We may assume\nthat \u201cthe obvious scheme\u201d of the 1949 Conventions is\nidentical in all relevant respects to that of the 1929 Con\nvention,57 and even that that scheme would, absent some\nother provision of law, preclude Hamdan\u2019s invocation of\nthe Convention\u2019s provisions as an independent source of\nlaw binding the Government\u2019s actions and furnishing\npetitioner with any enforceable right.58 For, regardless of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  57 But   see, e.g., 4 Int\u2019l Comm. of Red Cross, Commentary: Geneva\nConvention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of\nWar 21 (1958) (hereinafter GCIV Commentary) (the 1949 Geneva\nConventions were written \u201cfirst and foremost to protect individuals,\nand not to serve State interests\u201d); GCIII Commentary 91 (\u201cIt was not\n. . . until the Conventions of 1949 . . . that the existence of \u2018rights\u2019\nconferred in prisoners of war was affirmed\u201d).\n    58 But see generally Brief for Louis Henkin et al. as Amici Curiae; 1\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

S. 407 (1886), they are, as the\nGovernment does not dispute, part of the law of war. See\nHamdi, 542 U. S., at 520\u2013521 (plurality opinion). And\ncompliance with the law of war is the condition upon\nwhich the authority set forth in Article 21 is granted.\n                               ii\n   For the Court of Appeals, acknowledgment of that condi\ntion was no bar to Hamdan\u2019s trial by commission. As an\nalternative to its holding that Hamdan could not invoke\nthe Geneva Conventions at all, the Court of Appeals con\ncluded that the Conventions did not in any event apply to\nthe armed conflict during which Hamdan was captured.\nThe court accepted the Executive\u2019s assertions that Ham\ndan was captured in connection with the United States\u2019\nwar with al Qaeda and that that war is distinct from the\nwar with the Taliban in Afghanistan. It further reasoned\nthat the war with al Qaeda evades the reach of the Geneva\nConventions. See 415 F. 3d, at 41\u201342. We, like Judge\nWilliams, disagree with the latter conclusion.\n   The conflict with al Qaeda is not, according to the Gov\nernment, a conflict to which the full protections afforded\ndetainees under the 1949 Geneva Conventions apply\nbecause Article 2 of those Conventions (which appears in\nall four Conventions) renders the full protections applica\nble only to \u201call cases of declared war or of any other armed\nconflict which may arise between two or more of the High\nContracting Parties.\u201d 6 U.

RUMSFELD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwas captured and detained incident to the conflict with al\nQaeda and not the conflict with the Taliban, and since al\nQaeda, unlike Afghanistan, is not a \u201cHigh Contracting\nParty\u201d\u2014i.e., a signatory of the Conventions, the protec\ntions of those Conventions are not, it is argued, applicable\nto Hamdan.60\n   We need not decide the merits of this argument because\nthere is at least one provision of the Geneva Conventions\nthat applies here even if the relevant conflict is not one\nbetween signatories.61 Article 3, often referred to as Com\nmon Article 3 because, like Article 2, it appears in all four\nGeneva Conventions, provides that in a \u201cconflict not of an\ninternational character occurring in the territory of one of\nthe High Contracting Parties, each Party62 to the conflict\nshall be bound to apply, as a minimum,\u201d certain provisions\nprotecting \u201c[p]ersons taking no active part in the hostili\nties, including members of armed forces who have laid\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   60 The President has stated that the conflict with the Taliban is a con\n\nflict to which the Geneva Conventions apply. See White House Memo\nrandum, Humane Treatment of Taliban and al Qaeda Detainees 2\n(Feb. 7, 2002), available at http://www.justicescholars.org/pegc/archive/\nWhite_House/bush_memo_20020207_ed.pdf (hereinafter White House\nMemorandum).\n   61 Hamdan observes that Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention\n\nrequires that if there be \u201cany doubt\u201d whether he is entitled to prisoner-\nof-war protections, he must be afforded those protections until his\nstatus is determined by a \u201ccompetent tribunal.\u201d 6 U.

Because we\nhold that Hamdan may not, in any event, be tried by the military\ncommission the President has convened pursuant to the November 13\nOrder and Commission Order No. 1, the question whether his potential\nstatus as a prisoner of war independently renders illegal his trial by\nmilitary commission may be reserved.\n   62 The term \u201cParty\u201d here has the broadest possible meaning; a Party\n\nneed neither be a signatory of the Convention nor \u201ceven represent a\nlegal entity capable of undertaking international obligations.\u201d GCIII\nCommentary 37.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

One such provision prohibits \u201cthe\npassing of sentences and the carrying out of executions\nwithout previous judgment pronounced by a regularly\nconstituted court affording all the judicial guarantees\nwhich are recognized as indispensable by civilized peo\nples.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Court of Appeals thought, and the Government\nasserts, that Common Article 3 does not apply to Hamdan\nbecause the conflict with al Qaeda, being \u201c \u2018international in\nscope,\u2019 \u201d does not qualify as a \u201c \u2018conflict not of an interna\ntional character.\u2019 \u201d 415 F. 3d, at 41. That reasoning is\nerroneous. The term \u201cconflict not of an international\ncharacter\u201d is used here in contradistinction to a conflict\nbetween nations. So much is demonstrated by the \u201cfun\ndamental logic [of] the Convention\u2019s provisions on its\napplication.\u201d Id., at 44 (Williams, J., concurring). Com\nmon Article 2 provides that \u201cthe present Convention shall\napply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed\nconflict which may arise between two or more of the High\nContracting Parties.\u201d 6 U. S. T., at 3318 (Art. 2, \u00b61). High\nContracting Parties (signatories) also must abide by all\nterms of the Conventions vis-\u00e0-vis one another even if one\nparty to the conflict is a nonsignatory \u201cPower,\u201d and must\nso abide vis-\u00e0-vis the nonsignatory if \u201cthe latter accepts\nand applies\u201d those terms. Ibid. (Art. 2, \u00b63). Common\nArticle 3, by contrast, affords some minimal protection,\nfalling short of full protection under the Conventions, to\nindividuals associated with neither a signatory nor even a\nnonsignatory \u201cPower\u201d who are involved in a conflict \u201cin the\nterritory of\u201d a signatory. The latter kind of conflict is\ndistinguishable from the conflict described in Common\nArticle 2 chiefly because it does not involve a clash be\ntween nations (whether signatories or not). In context,\nthen, the phrase \u201cnot of an international character\u201d bears\nits literal meaning. See, e.g., J. Bentham, Introduction to\n68                     HAMDAN v.

While the\nterm \u201cregularly constituted court\u201d is not specifically de\nfined in either Common Article 3 or its accompanying\ncommentary, other sources disclose its core meaning.

But it\nmust be understood to incorporate at least the barest of\nthose trial protections that have been recognized by cus\ntomary international law. Many of these are described in\nArticle 75 of Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1949,\nadopted in 1977 (Protocol I). Although the United States\ndeclined to ratify Protocol I, its objections were not to\nArticle 75 thereof. Indeed, it appears that the Govern\nment \u201cregard[s] the provisions of Article 75 as an articula\ntion of safeguards to which all persons in the hands of an\nenemy are entitled.\u201d Taft, The Law of Armed Conflict\nAfter 9/11: Some Salient Features, 28 Yale J.

See post, at 8, 11\u201317. We\nadd only that, as noted in Part VI\u2013A, supra, various provi\nsions of Commission Order No. 1 dispense with the princi\nples, articulated in Article 75 and indisputably part of the\ncustomary international law, that an accused must, absent\ndisruptive conduct or consent, be present for his trial and\nmust be privy to the evidence against him. See \u00a7\u00a76(B)(3),\n(D).67 That the Government has a compelling interest in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsignatory include the same basic protections set forth in Article 75.\nSee, e.g., International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Art. 14,\n\u00b63(d), Mar. 23, 1976, 999 U. N. T. S. 171 (setting forth the right of an\naccused \u201c[t]o be tried in his presence, and to defend himself in person or\nthrough legal assistance of his own choosing\u201d). Following World War II,\nseveral defendants were tried and convicted by military commission for\nviolations of the law of war in their failure to afford captives fair trials\nbefore imposition and execution of sentence. In two such trials, the\nprosecutors argued that the defendants\u2019 failure to apprise accused\nindividuals of all evidence against them constituted violations of the\nlaw of war. See 5 U. N. War Crimes Commission 30 (trial of Sergeant-\nMajor Shigeru Ohashi), 75 (trial of General Tanaka Hisakasu).\n   67 The Government offers no defense of these procedures other than to\n\nobserve that the defendant may not be barred from access to evidence if\nsuch action would deprive him of a \u201cfull and fair trial.\u201d Commission\nOrder No. 1, \u00a76(D)(5)(b). But the Government suggests no circum\nstances in which it would be \u201cfair\u201d to convict the accused based on\nevidence he has not seen or heard. Cf. Crawford v. Washington, 541\nU.

But re\nquirements they are nonetheless. The commission that\nthe President has convened to try Hamdan does not meet\nthose requirements.\n                            VII\n  We have assumed, as we must, that the allegations\nmade in the Government\u2019s charge against Hamdan are\ntrue. We have assumed, moreover, the truth of the mes\nsage implicit in that charge\u2014viz., that Hamdan is a dan\ngerous individual whose beliefs, if acted upon, would cause\ngreat harm and even death to innocent civilians, and who\nwould act upon those beliefs if given the opportunity. It\nbears emphasizing that Hamdan does not challenge, and\nwe do not today address, the Government\u2019s power to de\ntain him for the duration of active hostilities in order to\nprevent such harm. But in undertaking to try Hamdan\nand subject him to criminal punishment, the Executive is\nbound to comply with the Rule of Law that prevails in this\njurisdiction.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nplea that evidence of guilt must be secret is abhorrent to free men\u201d\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).

That claim leads me to\nstate briefly what I believe the majority sets forth both\nexplicitly and implicitly at greater length. The Court\u2019s\nconclusion ultimately rests upon a single ground: Congress\nhas not issued the Executive a \u201cblank check.\u201d Cf. Hamdi\nv. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 536 (2004) (plurality opinion).\nIndeed, Congress has denied the President the legisla-\ntive authority to create military commissions of the kind\nat issue here. Nothing prevents the President from re\nturning to Congress to seek the authority he believes\nnecessary.\n   Where, as here, no emergency prevents consultation\nwith Congress, judicial insistence upon that consultation\ndoes not weaken our Nation\u2019s ability to deal with danger.\nTo the contrary, that insistence strengthens the Nation\u2019s\nability to determine\u2014through democratic means\u2014how\nbest to do so. The Constitution places its faith in those\ndemocratic means. Our Court today simply does the same.\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

This is not a\ncase, then, where the Executive can assert some unilateral\nauthority to fill a void left by congressional inaction. It is\na case where Congress, in the proper exercise of its powers\nas an independent branch of government, and as part of a\nlong tradition of legislative involvement in matters of\nmilitary justice, has considered the subject of military\ntribunals and set limits on the President\u2019s authority.\nWhere a statute provides the conditions for the exercise of\ngovernmental power, its requirements are the result of a\ndeliberative and reflective process engaging both of the\npolitical branches. Respect for laws derived from the\ncustomary operation of the Executive and Legislative\nBranches gives some assurance of stability in time of\ncrisis. The Constitution is best preserved by reliance on\nstandards tested over time and insulated from the pres\nsures of the moment.\n   These principles seem vindicated here, for a case that\n2                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                 KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\n\nmay be of extraordinary importance is resolved by ordi\nnary rules. The rules of most relevance here are those\npertaining to the authority of Congress and the interpre\ntation of its enactments.\n   It seems appropriate to recite these rather fundamental\npoints because the Court refers, as it should in its exposi\ntion of the case, to the requirement of the Geneva Conven\ntions of 1949 that military tribunals be \u201cregularly consti\ntuted\u201d ante, at 69\u2014a requirement that controls here, if for\nno other reason, because Congress requires that military\ncommissions like the ones at issue conform to the \u201claw of\nwar,\u201d 10 U. S. C. \u00a7821. Whatever the substance and con\ntent of the term \u201cregularly constituted\u201d as interpreted in\nthis and any later cases, there seems little doubt that it\nrelies upon the importance of standards deliberated upon\nand chosen in advance of crisis, under a system where the\nsingle power of the Executive is checked by other constitu\ntional mechanisms. All of which returns us to the point of\nbeginning\u2014that domestic statutes control this case. If\nCongress, after due consideration, deems it appropriate to\nchange the controlling statutes, in conformance with the\nConstitution and other laws, it has the power and preroga\ntive to do so.\n   I join the Court\u2019s opinion, save Parts V and VI\u2013D\u2013iv. To\nstate my reasons for this reservation, and to show my\nagreement with the remainder of the Court\u2019s analysis by\nidentifying particular deficiencies in the military commis\nsions at issue, this separate opinion seems appropriate.\n                              I\n  Trial by military commission raises separation-of\npowers concerns of the highest order. Located within a\nsingle branch, these courts carry the risk that offenses will\nbe defined, prosecuted, and adjudicated by executive\nofficials without independent review. Cf. Loving v.

It is imperative, then, that when military\ntribunals are established, full and proper authority exists\nfor the Presidential directive.\n   The proper framework for assessing whether Executive\nactions are authorized is the three-part scheme used by\nJustice Jackson in his opinion in Youngstown Sheet & Tube\nCo. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579 (1952). \u201cWhen the President\nacts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of\nCongress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all\nthat he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can\ndelegate.\u201d Id., at 635. \u201cWhen the President acts in absence\nof either a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can\nonly rely upon his own independent powers, but there is a\nzone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concur\nrent authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain.\u201d\nId., at 637. And \u201c[w]hen the President takes measures\nincompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress,\nhis power is at its lowest ebb.\u201d Ibid.\n   In this case, as the Court observes, the President has\nacted in a field with a history of congressional participa\ntion and regulation. Ante, at 28\u201330, 55\u201357. In the Uni\nform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S. C. \u00a7801 et\nseq., which Congress enacted, building on earlier statutes,\nin 1950, see Act of May 5, 1950, ch. 169, 64 Stat. 107, and\nlater amended, see, e.g., Military Justice Act of 1968, 82\nStat. 1335, Congress has set forth governing principles for\nmilitary courts. The UCMJ as a whole establishes an\nintricate system of military justice. It authorizes courts-\nmartial in various forms, 10 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7816\u2013820 (2000 ed.\nand Supp. III); it regulates the organization and procedure\nof those courts, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7822\u2013835, 851\u2013854; it defines of\nfenses, \u00a7\u00a7877\u2013934, and rights for the accused, e.g.,\n\u00a7\u00a7827(b)\u2013(c), 831, 844, 846, 855 (2000 ed.); and it provides\nmechanisms for appellate review, \u00a7\u00a7859\u2013876b (2000 ed.\n4                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\n\nand Supp. III). As explained below, the statute further\nrecognizes that special military commissions may be\nconvened to try war crimes. See infra, at 5\u20136; \u00a7821 (2000\ned.). While these laws provide authority for certain forms\nof military courts, they also impose limitations, at least\ntwo of which control this case. If the President has ex\nceeded these limits, this becomes a case of conflict between\nPresidential and congressional action\u2014a case within\nJustice Jackson\u2019s third category, not the second or first.\n  One limit on the President\u2019s authority is contained in\n\u00a7836 of the UCMJ. That section provides:\n    \u201c(a) Pretrial, trial, and post-trial procedures, including\n    modes of proof, for cases arising under this chapter\n    triable in courts-martial, military commissions and\n    other military tribunals, and procedures for courts of\n    inquiry, may be prescribed by the President by regu\n    lations which shall, so far as he considers practicable,\n    apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence\n    generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in\n    the United States district courts, but which may not\n    be contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter.\n    \u201c(b) All rules and regulations made under this article\n    shall be uniform insofar as practicable.\u201d 10 U.

C.\n    \u00a7836 (2000 ed.).\nIn this provision the statute allows the President to im\nplement and build on the UCMJ\u2019s framework by adopting\nprocedural regulations, subject to three requirements: (1)\nProcedures for military courts must conform to district-\ncourt rules insofar as the President \u201cconsiders practica\nble\u201d; (2) the procedures may not be contrary to or inconsis\ntent with the provisions of the UCMJ; and (3) \u201cinsofar as\npracticable\u201d all rules and regulations under \u00a7836 must be\nuniform, a requirement, as the Court points out, that\nindicates the rules must be the same for military commis\nsions as for courts-martial unless such uniformity is im\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

Ante, at 59\u201362. Although we can\nassume the President\u2019s practicability judgments are enti\ntled to some deference, the Court observes that Congress\u2019\nchoice of language in the uniformity provision of 10\nU. S. C. \u00a7836(b) contrasts with the language of \u00a7836(a).\nThis difference suggests, at the least, a lower degree of\ndeference for \u00a7836(b) determinations. Ante, at 59\u201360. The\nrules for military courts may depart from federal-court\nrules whenever the President \u201cconsiders\u201d conformity im\npracticable, \u00a7836(a); but the statute requires procedural\nuniformity across different military courts \u201cinsofar as\n[uniformity is] practicable,\u201d \u00a7836(b), not insofar as the\nPresident considers it to be so. The Court is right to con\nclude this is of relevance to our decision. Further, as the\nCourt is also correct to conclude, ante, at 60, the term\n\u201cpracticable\u201d cannot be construed to permit deviations\nbased on mere convenience or expedience. \u201cPracticable\u201d\nmeans \u201cfeasible,\u201d that is, \u201cpossible to practice or perform\u201d\nor \u201ccapable of being put into practice, done, or accom\nplished.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary\n1780 (1961). Congress\u2019 chosen language, then, is best\nunderstood to allow the selection of procedures based on\nlogistical constraints, the accommodation of witnesses, the\nsecurity of the proceedings, and the like. Insofar as the\n\u201c[p]retrial, trial, and post-trial procedures\u201d for the military\ncommissions at issue deviate from court-martial practice,\nthe deviations must be explained by some such practical\nneed.\n   In addition to \u00a7836, a second UCMJ provision, 10\n6                   HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                 KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\n\nU. S. C. \u00a7821, requires us to compare the commissions at\nissue to courts-martial. This provision states:\n    \u201cThe provisions of this chapter conferring jurisdiction\n    upon courts-martial do not deprive military commis\n    sions, provost courts, or other military tribunals of\n    concurrent jurisdiction with respect to offenders or of\n    fenses that by statute or by the law of war may be\n    tried by military commissions, provost courts, or other\n    military tribunals.\u201d\n   In \u00a7821 Congress has addressed the possibility that\nspecial military commissions\u2014criminal courts other than\ncourts-martial\u2014may at times be convened. At the same\ntime, however, the President\u2019s authority to convene mili\ntary commissions is limited: It extends only to \u201coffenders\nor offenses\u201d that \u201cby statute or by the law of war may be\ntried by\u201d such military commissions. Ibid.; see also ante,\nat 28\u201329. The Government does not claim to base the\ncharges against Hamdan on a statute; instead it invokes\nthe law of war. That law, as the Court explained in Ex\nparte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942), derives from \u201crules and\nprecepts of the law of nations\u201d; it is the body of international\nlaw governing armed conflict. Id., at 28. If the military\ncommission at issue is illegal under the law of war, then\nan offender cannot be tried \u201cby the law of war\u201d before that\ncommission.\n   The Court is correct to concentrate on one provision of\nthe law of war that is applicable to our Nation\u2019s armed\nconflict with al Qaeda in Afghanistan and, as a result, to\nthe use of a military commission to try Hamdan. Ante, at\n65\u201370; see also 415 F. 3d 33, 44 (CADC 2005) (Williams,\nJ., concurring). That provision is Common Article 3 of the\nfour Geneva Conventions of 1949. It prohibits, as relevant\nhere, \u201c[t]he passing of sentences and the carrying out of\nexecutions without previous judgment pronounced by a\nregularly constituted court affording all the judicial guar\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                 KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\n\nantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized\npeoples.\u201d See, e.g., Article 3 of the Geneva Convention\n(III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug.\n12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316, 3318, T. I. A. S. No. 3364.\nThe provision is part of a treaty the United States has\nratified and thus accepted as binding law. See id., at\n3316. By Act of Congress, moreover, violations of Common\nArticle 3 are considered \u201cwar crimes,\u201d punishable as fed\neral offenses, when committed by or against United States\nnationals and military personnel. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a72441.\nThere should be no doubt, then, that Common Article 3 is\npart of the law of war as that term is used in \u00a7821.\n   The dissent by JUSTICE THOMAS argues that Common\nArticle 3 nonetheless is irrelevant to this case because in\nJohnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763 (1950), it was said to\nbe the \u201cobvious scheme\u201d of the 1929 Geneva Convention\nthat \u201c[r]ights of alien enemies are vindicated under it only\nthrough protests and intervention of protecting powers,\u201d\ni.e., signatory states, id., at 789, n. 14. As the Court ex\nplains, ante, at 63\u201365, this language from Eisentrager is\nnot controlling here. Even assuming the Eisentrager\nanalysis has some bearing upon the analysis of the\nbroader 1949 Conventions and that, in consequence, rights\nare vindicated \u201cunder [those Conventions]\u201d only through\nprotests and intervention, 339 U. S., at 789, n. 14, Com\nmon Article 3 is nonetheless relevant to the question of\nauthorization under \u00a7821. Common Article 3 is part of the\nlaw of war that Congress has directed the President to\nfollow in establishing military commissions. Ante, at 66\u2013\n67. Consistent with that view, the Eisentrager Court itself\nconsidered on the merits claims that \u201cprocedural irregu\nlarities\u201d under the 1929 Convention \u201cdeprive[d] the Mili\ntary Commission of jurisdiction.\u201d 339 U. S., at 789, 790.\n   In another military commission case, In re Yamashita,\n327 U. S. 1 (1946), the Court likewise considered on the\nmerits\u2014without any caveat about remedies under the\n8                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\n\nConvention\u2014a claim that an alleged violation of the 1929\nConvention \u201cestablish[ed] want of authority in the com\nmission to proceed with the trial.\u201d Id., at 23, 24. That is\nthe precise inquiry we are asked to perform here.\n   Assuming the President has authority to establish a\nspecial military commission to try Hamdan, the commis\nsion must satisfy Common Article 3\u2019s requirement of a\n\u201cregularly constituted court affording all the judicial guar\nantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized\npeoples,\u201d 6 U. S. T., at 3318. The terms of this general\nstandard are yet to be elaborated and further defined, but\nCongress has required compliance with it by referring to\nthe \u201claw of war\u201d in \u00a7821. The Court correctly concludes\nthat the military commission here does not comply with\nthis provision.\n   Common Article 3\u2019s standard of a \u201cregularly constituted\ncourt affording all the judicial guarantees which are rec\nognized as indispensable by civilized peoples,\u201d ibid., sup\nports, at the least, a uniformity principle similar to that\ncodified in \u00a7836(b). The concept of a \u201cregularly constituted\ncourt\u201d providing \u201cindispensable\u201d judicial guarantees re\nquires consideration of the system of justice under which\nthe commission is established, though no doubt certain\nminimum standards are applicable. See ante, at 69\u201370; 1\nInt\u2019l Committee of the Red Cross, Customary Interna\ntional Humanitarian Law 355 (2005) (explaining that\ncourts are \u201cregularly constituted\u201d under Common Article 3\nif they are \u201cestablished and organised in accordance with\nthe laws and procedures already in force in a country\u201d).\n   The regular military courts in our system are the courts-\nmartial established by congressional statutes. Acts of\nCongress confer on those courts the jurisdiction to try \u201cany\nperson\u201d subject to war crimes prosecution. 10 U. S. C.\n\u00a7818. As the Court explains, moreover, while special\nmilitary commissions have been convened in previous\narmed conflicts\u2014a practice recognized in \u00a7821\u2014those\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

See, e.g., 1 The War\nof the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of\nthe Union and Confederate Armies 248 (2d series 1894)\n(Civil War general order requiring that military commis\nsions \u201cbe constituted in a similar manner and their pro\nceedings be conducted according to the same general rules\nas courts-martial in order to prevent abuses which might\notherwise arise\u201d); W. Winthrop, Military Law and Prece\ndents 835, n. 81 (rev. 2d ed. 1920) (\u201c[M]ilitary commissions\nare constituted and composed, and their proceedings are\nconducted, similarly to general courts-martial\u201d); 1 United\nNations War Crimes Commission, Law Reports of Trials of\nWar Criminals 116\u2013117 (1947) (reprint 1997) (hereinafter\nLaw Reports) (discussing post-World War II regulations\nrequiring that military commissions \u201chav[e] regard for\u201d\nrules of procedure and evidence applicable in general\ncourts-martial); see also ante, at 53\u201357; post, at 31, n. 15\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting). Today, moreover, \u00a7836(b)\u2014\nwhich took effect after the military trials in the World War\nII cases invoked by the dissent, see Madsen v. Kinsella, 343\nU. S. 341, 344\u2013345, and n. 6 (1952); Yamashita, supra, at 5;\nQuirin, 317 U. S., at 23\u2014codifies this presumption of uni\nformity at least as to \u201c[p]retrial, trial, and post-trial proce\ndures.\u201d Absent more concrete statutory guidance, this\nhistorical and statutory background\u2014which suggests that\nsome practical need must justify deviations from the\ncourt-martial model\u2014informs the understanding of which\nmilitary courts are \u201cregularly constituted\u201d under United\nStates law.\n   In addition, whether or not the possibility, contemplated\nby the regulations here, of midtrial procedural changes\ncould by itself render a military commission impermissibly\nirregular, ante, at 70, n. 65; see also Military Commission\nOrder No. 1, \u00a711 (Aug. 31, 2005), App. to Brief for Peti\ntioner 46a\u201372a (hereinafter MCO), an acceptable degree of\n10                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                 KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\n\nindependence from the Executive is necessary to render a\ncommission \u201cregularly constituted\u201d by the standards of our\nNation\u2019s system of justice. And any suggestion of Execu\ntive power to interfere with an ongoing judicial process\nraises concerns about the proceedings\u2019 fairness. Again,\nhowever, courts-martial provide the relevant benchmark.\nSubject to constitutional limitations, see Ex parte Milligan,\n4 Wall. 2 (1866), Congress has the power and responsibility\nto determine the necessity for military courts, and to\nprovide the jurisdiction and procedures applicable to them.\nThe guidance Congress has provided with respect to\ncourts-martial indicates the level of independence and\nprocedural rigor that Congress has deemed necessary, at\nleast as a general matter, in the military context.\n   At a minimum a military commission like the one at\nissue\u2014a commission specially convened by the President\nto try specific persons without express congressional au\nthorization\u2014can be \u201cregularly constituted\u201d by the stan\ndards of our military justice system only if some practical\nneed explains deviations from court-martial practice. In\nthis regard the standard of Common Article 3, applied\nhere in conformity with \u00a7821, parallels the practicability\nstandard of \u00a7836(b). Section 836, however, is limited by\nits terms to matters properly characterized as proce\ndural\u2014that is, \u201c[p]retrial, trial, and post-trial proce\ndures\u201d\u2014while Common Article 3 permits broader consid\neration of matters of structure, organization, and\nmechanisms to promote the tribunal\u2019s insulation from\ncommand influence. Thus the combined effect of the two\nstatutes discussed here\u2014\u00a7\u00a7836 and 821\u2014is that consid\nerations of practicability must support departures from\ncourt-martial practice. Relevant concerns, as noted ear\nlier, relate to logistical constraints, accommodation of\nwitnesses, security of the proceedings, and the like, not\nmere expedience or convenience. This determination, of\ncourse, must be made with due regard for the constitu\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a\u2013\n67a. Nevertheless, the circumstances of Hamdan\u2019s trial\npresent no exigency requiring special speed or precluding\ncareful consideration of evidence. For roughly four years,\nHamdan has been detained at a permanent United States\nmilitary base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. And regardless\nof the outcome of the criminal proceedings at issue, the\nGovernment claims authority to continue to detain him\nbased on his status as an enemy combatant.\n   Against this background, the Court is correct to con\nclude that the military commission the President has\nconvened to try Hamdan is unauthorized. Ante, at 62, 69\u2013\n70, 72. The following analysis, which expands on the\nCourt\u2019s discussion, explains my reasons for reaching this\nconclusion.\n   To begin with, the structure and composition of the\nmilitary commission deviate from conventional court-\nmartial standards. Although these deviations raise ques\ntions about the fairness of the trial, no evident practical\n12                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                 KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\n\nneed explains them.\n   Under the UCMJ, courts-martial are organized by a\n\u201cconvening authority\u201d\u2014either a commanding officer, the\nSecretary of Defense, the Secretary concerned, or the\nPresident. 10 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7822\u2013824 (2000 ed. and Supp. III).\nThe convening authority refers charges for trial, Manual\nfor Courts-Martial, United States, Rule for Courts-Martial\n401 (2005 ed.) (hereinafter R. C. M.), and selects the court-\nmartial members who vote on the guilt or innocence of the\naccused and determine the sentence, 10 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a7825(d)(2), 851\u2013852 (2000 ed.); R. C. M. 503(a).

In addition\nthe Appointing Authority determines the number of com\nmission members (at least three), oversees the chief prose\ncutor, provides \u201cinvestigative or other resources\u201d to the\ndefense insofar as he or she \u201cdeems necessary for a full\nand fair trial,\u201d approves or rejects plea agreements, ap\nproves or disapproves communications with news media\nby prosecution or defense counsel (a function shared by\nthe General Counsel of the Department of Defense), and\nissues supplementary commission regulations (subject to\napproval by the General Counsel of the Department of\nDefense, unless the Appointing Authority is the Secretary\nof Defense).

At a general court-\nmartial\u2014the only type authorized to impose penalties of\nmore than one year\u2019s incarceration or to adjudicate of\nfenses against the law of war, R. C. M. 201(f); 10 U.

C. \u00a7819 (2000 ed. and Supp. III) (same).\nA military judge is an officer who is a member of a state or\nfederal bar and has been specially certified for judicial\nduties by the Judge Advocate General for the officer\u2019s\nArmed Service. R. C. M. 502(c); 10 U. S. C. \u00a7826(b). To\nprotect their independence, military judges at general\ncourts-martial are \u201cassigned and directly responsible to\nthe Judge Advocate General or the Judge Advocate Gen\neral\u2019s designee.\u201d R. C. M. 502(c). They must be detailed to\nthe court, in accordance with applicable regulations, \u201cby a\nperson assigned as a military judge and directly responsi\nble to the Judge Advocate General or the Judge Advocate\nGeneral\u2019s designee.\u201d R.

Here, by contrast, the\nAppointing Authority selects the presiding officer, MCO\nNo. 1, \u00a7\u00a74(A)(1), (A)(4); and that officer need only be a\njudge advocate, that is, a military lawyer, \u00a74(A)(4).\n14                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                 KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\n\n   The Appointing Authority, moreover, exercises supervi\nsory powers that continue during trial. Any interlocutory\nquestion \u201cthe disposition of which would effect a termina\ntion of proceedings with respect to a charge\u201d is subject to\ndecision not by the presiding officer, but by the Appointing\nAuthority. \u00a74(A)(5)(e) (stating that the presiding officer\n\u201cshall certify\u201d such questions to the Appointing Authority).\nOther interlocutory questions may be certified to the\nAppointing Authority as the presiding officer \u201cdeems\nappropriate.\u201d Ibid. While in some circumstances the\nGovernment may appeal certain rulings at a court-\nmartial\u2014including \u201can order or ruling that terminates the\nproceedings with respect to a charge or specification,\u201d\nR. C. M. 908(a); see also 10 U. S. C. \u00a7862(a)\u2014the appeals\ngo to a body called the Court of Criminal Appeals, not to\nthe convening authority. R. C. M. 908; 10 U. S. C. \u00a7862(b);\nsee also R. C. M. 1107 (requiring the convening authority\nto approve or disapprove the findings and sentence of a\ncourt-martial but providing for such action only after\nentry of sentence and restricting actions that increase\npenalties); 10 U.

R. C. M. 1203; 10 U. S. C. \u00a7866. This is\nanother means in which, by structure and tradition, the\ncourt-martial process is insulated from those who have an\ninterest in the outcome of the proceedings.\n   Finally, in addition to these powers with respect to the\npresiding officer, the Appointing Authority has greater\nflexibility in appointing commission members. While a\ngeneral court-martial requires, absent a contrary election\nby the accused, at least five members, R. C. M. 501(a)(1);\n10 U. S.

This difference may affect\nthe deliberative process and the prosecution\u2019s burden of\npersuasion.\n   As compared to the role of the convening authority in a\ncourt-martial, the greater powers of the Appointing Au\nthority here\u2014including even the resolution of dispositive\nissues in the middle of the trial\u2014raise concerns that the\ncommission\u2019s decisionmaking may not be neutral. If the\ndifferences are supported by some practical need beyond\nthe goal of constant and ongoing supervision, that need is\nneither apparent from the record nor established by the\nGovernment\u2019s submissions.\n   It is no answer that, at the end of the day, the Detainee\nTreatment Act of 2005 (DTA), 119 Stat. 2739, affords\nmilitary-commission defendants the opportunity for judi\ncial review in federal court. As the Court is correct to\nobserve, the scope of that review is limited, DTA\n\u00a71005(e)(3)(D), id., at 2743; see also ante, at 8\u20139, and the\nreview is not automatic if the defendant\u2019s sentence is\nunder 10 years, \u00a71005(e)(3)(B), ibid. Also, provisions for\nreview of legal issues after trial cannot correct for struc\ntural defects, such as the role of the Appointing Authority,\nthat can cast doubt on the factfinding process and the\npresiding judge\u2019s exercise of discretion during trial. Before\nmilitary-commission defendants may obtain judicial re\nview, furthermore, they must navigate a military review\nprocess that again raises fairness concerns. At the outset,\nthe Appointing Authority (unless the Appointing Author\nity is the Secretary of Defense) performs an \u201cadministra\ntive review\u201d of undefined scope, ordering any \u201csupplemen\ntary proceedings\u201d deemed necessary. MCO No. 1 \u00a76(H)(3).\nAfter that the case is referred to a three-member\nReview Panel composed of officers selected by the\nSecretary of Defense. \u00a76(H)(4); MCI No. 9, \u00a74(B) (Oct. 11,\n2005), available at www.defenselink.mil/news/Oct2005/\nd20051014MCI9.pdf.

C. \u00a7\u00a7862,\n864, 866, 867, 869, the review process here lacks struc\ntural protections designed to help ensure impartiality.\n   These structural differences between the military com\nmissions and courts-martial\u2014the concentration of func\ntions, including legal decisionmaking, in a single executive\nofficial; the less rigorous standards for composition of the\ntribunal; and the creation of special review procedures in\nplace of institutions created and regulated by Congress\u2014\nremove safeguards that are important to the fairness of\nthe proceedings and the independence of the court. Con\ngress has prescribed these guarantees for courts-martial;\nand no evident practical need explains the departures\nhere. For these reasons the commission cannot be consid\nered regularly constituted under United States law and\nthus does not satisfy Congress\u2019 requirement that military\ncommissions conform to the law of war.\n   Apart from these structural issues, moreover, the basic\nprocedures for the commissions deviate from procedures\nfor courts-martial, in violation of \u00a7836(b). As the Court\nexplains, ante, at 51, 61, the Military Commission Order\nabandons the detailed Military Rules of Evidence, which\nare modeled on the Federal Rules of Evidence in confor\nmity with \u00a7836(a)\u2019s requirement of presumptive compli\nance with district-court rules.\n   Instead, the order imposes just one evidentiary rule:\n\u201cEvidence shall be admitted if . . . the evidence would have\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

Although it is true some military commissions\napplied an amorphous evidence standard in the past, see,\ne.g., 1 Law Reports 117\u2013118 (discussing World War II\nmilitary commission orders); Exec. Order No. 9185, 7 Fed.\nReg. 5103 (1942) (order convening military commission to\ntry Nazi saboteurs), the evidentiary rules for those com\nmissions were adopted before Congress enacted the uni\nformity requirement of 10 U. S. C. \u00a7836(b) as part of the\nUCMJ, see Act of May 5, 1950, ch. 169, 64 Stat. 107, 120,\n149. And while some flexibility may be necessary to per\nmit trial of battlefield captives like Hamdan, military\nstatutes and rules already provide for introduction of\ndeposition testimony for absent witnesses, 10 U. S. C.\n\u00a7849(d); R. C. M. 702, and use of classified information,\nMilitary Rule Evid. 505. Indeed, the deposition-testimony\nprovision specifically mentions military commissions and\nthus is one of the provisions the Government concedes\nmust be followed by the commission at issue. See ante, at\n58. That provision authorizes admission of deposition\ntestimony only if the witness is absent for specified rea\nsons, \u00a7849(d)\u2014a requirement that makes no sense if\nmilitary commissions may consider all probative evidence.\nWhether or not this conflict renders the rules at issue\n\u201ccontrary to or inconsistent with\u201d the UCMJ under\n\u00a7836(a), it creates a uniformity problem under \u00a7836(b).\n   The rule here could permit admission of multiple hear\nsay and other forms of evidence generally prohibited on\ngrounds of unreliability. Indeed, the commission regula\ntions specifically contemplate admission of unsworn writ\nten statements, MCO No. 1, \u00a76(D)(3); and they make no\nprovision for exclusion of coerced declarations save those\n\u201cestablished to have been made as a result of torture,\u201d\nMCI No. 10, \u00a73(A) (Mar. 24, 2006), available at www.\ndefenselink.mil/news/Mar2006/d20060327MCI10.pdf; cf.\nMilitary Rule Evid. 304(c)(3) (generally barring use of\n18                 HAMDAN v.

C.\n\u00a7831(d) (same). Besides, even if evidence is deemed non-\nprobative by the presiding officer at Hamdan\u2019s trial, the\nmilitary-commission members still may view it. In an\nother departure from court-martial practice the military\ncommission members may object to the presiding officer\u2019s\nevidence rulings and determine themselves, by majority\nvote, whether to admit the evidence. MCO No. 1, \u00a76(D)(1);\ncf. R. C. M. 801(a)(4), (e)(1) (providing that the military\njudge at a court-martial determines all questions of law).\n   As the Court explains, the Government has made no\ndemonstration of practical need for these special rules and\nprocedures, either in this particular case or as to the\nmilitary commissions in general, ante, at 59\u201361; nor is any\nsuch need self-evident. For all the Government\u2019s regula\ntions and submissions reveal, it would be feasible for most,\nif not all, of the conventional military evidence rules and\nprocedures to be followed.\n   In sum, as presently structured, Hamdan\u2019s military\ncommission exceeds the bounds Congress has placed on\nthe President\u2019s authority in \u00a7\u00a7836 and 821 of the UCMJ.\nBecause Congress has prescribed these limits, Congress\ncan change them, requiring a new analysis consistent with\nthe Constitution and other governing laws. At this time,\nhowever, we must apply the standards Congress has\nprovided. By those standards the military commission is\ndeficient.\n                            III\n  In light of the conclusion that the military commission\nhere is unauthorized under the UCMJ, I see no need to\nconsider several further issues addressed in the plurality\nopinion by JUSTICE STEVENS and the dissent by JUSTICE\nTHOMAS.\n  First, I would not decide whether Common Article 3\u2019s\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

S. T., at 3320 (\u00b6(1)(d))\u2014\nnecessarily requires that the accused have the right to be\npresent at all stages of a criminal trial. As JUSTICE\nSTEVENS explains, Military Commission Order No. 1\nauthorizes exclusion of the accused from the proceedings if\nthe presiding officer determines that, among other things,\nprotection of classified information so requires.         See\n\u00a7\u00a76(B)(3), (D)(5); ante, at 50. JUSTICE STEVENS observes\nthat these regulations create the possibility of a conviction\nand sentence based on evidence Hamdan has not seen or\nheard\u2014a possibility the plurality is correct to consider\ntroubling. Ante, at 71\u201372, n. 67 (collecting cases); see also\nIn re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257, 277 (1948) (finding \u201cno support\nfor sustaining petitioner\u2019s conviction of contempt of court\nupon testimony given in petitioner\u2019s absence\u201d).\n  As the dissent by JUSTICE THOMAS points out, however,\nthe regulations bar the presiding officer from admitting\nsecret evidence if doing so would deprive the accused of a\n\u201cfull and fair trial.\u201d MCO No. 1, \u00a76(D)(5)(b); see also post,\nat 47. This fairness determination, moreover, is unambi\nguously subject to judicial review under the DTA. See\n\u00a71005(e)(3)(D)(i), 119 Stat. 2743 (allowing review of com\npliance with the \u201cstandards and procedures\u201d in Military\nCommission Order No. 1). The evidentiary proceedings at\nHamdan\u2019s trial have yet to commence, and it remains to be\nseen whether he will suffer any prejudicial exclusion.\n  There should be reluctance, furthermore, to reach un\nnecessarily the question whether, as the plurality seems to\nconclude, ante, at 70, Article 75 of Protocol I to the Geneva\nConventions is binding law notwithstanding the earlier\ndecision by our Government not to accede to the Protocol.\nFor all these reasons, and without detracting from the\nimportance of the right of presence, I would rely on other\ndeficiencies noted here and in the opinion by the Court\u2014\n20                HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\n\ndeficiencies that relate to the structure and procedure of\nthe commission and that inevitably will affect the proceed\nings\u2014as the basis for finding the military commissions\nlack authorization under 10 U. S. C. \u00a7836 and fail to be\nregularly constituted under Common Article 3 and \u00a7821.\n  I likewise see no need to address the validity of the\nconspiracy charge against Hamdan\u2014an issue addressed at\nlength in Part V of JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 opinion and in Part\nII\u2013C of JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019 dissent. See ante, at 36\u201349; post,\nat 12\u201328. In light of the conclusion that the military\ncommissions at issue are unauthorized Congress may\nchoose to provide further guidance in this area. Congress,\nnot the Court, is the branch in the better position to un\ndertake the \u201csensitive task of establishing a principle not\ninconsistent with the national interest or international\njustice.\u201d Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U. S.\n398, 428 (1964).\n  Finally, for the same reason, I express no view on the\nmerits of other limitations on military commissions de\nscribed as elements of the common law of war in Part V of\nJUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 opinion.

DONALD\n  H. RUMSFELD, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n                        [June 29, 2006] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS and\nJUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting.\n   On December 30, 2005, Congress enacted the Detainee\nTreatment Act (DTA). It unambiguously provides that, as\nof that date, \u201cno court, justice, or judge\u201d shall have juris\ndiction to consider the habeas application of a Guan\ntanamo Bay detainee. Notwithstanding this plain direc\ntive, the Court today concludes that, on what it calls the\nstatute\u2019s most natural reading, every \u201ccourt, justice, or\njudge\u201d before whom such a habeas application was pend\ning on December 30 has jurisdiction to hear, consider, and\nrender judgment on it. This conclusion is patently errone\nous. And even if it were not, the jurisdiction supposedly\nretained should, in an exercise of sound equitable discre\ntion, not be exercised.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n  The DTA provides: \u201c[N]o court, justice, or judge shall\nhave jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a\nwrit of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien\ndetained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo\nBay, Cuba.\u201d \u00a71005(e)(1), 119 Stat. 2742 (internal division\nomitted). This provision \u201ct[ook] effect on the date of the\nenactment of this Act,\u201d \u00a71005(h)(1), id., at 2743, which was\n2                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nDecember 30, 2005. As of that date, then, no court had\njurisdiction to \u201chear or consider\u201d the merits of petitioner\u2019s\nhabeas application. This repeal of jurisdiction is simply\nnot ambiguous as between pending and future cases. It\nprohibits any exercise of jurisdiction, and it became effec\ntive as to all cases last December 30. It is also perfectly\nclear that the phrase \u201cno court, justice, or judge\u201d includes\nthis Court and its Members, and that by exercising our\nappellate jurisdiction in this case we are \u201chear[ing] or\nconsider[ing] . . . an application for a writ of habeas\ncorpus.\u201d\n   An ancient and unbroken line of authority attests that\nstatutes ousting jurisdiction unambiguously apply to cases\npending at their effective date. For example, in Bruner v.\nUnited States, 343 U. S. 112 (1952), we granted certiorari\nto consider whether the Tucker Act\u2019s provision denying\ndistrict court jurisdiction over suits by \u201cofficers\u201d of the\nUnited States barred a suit by an employee of the United\nStates. After we granted certiorari, Congress amended\nthe Tucker Act by adding suits by \u201c \u2018employees\u2019 \u201d to the\nprovision barring jurisdiction over suits by officers. Id., at\n114. This statute narrowing the jurisdiction of the district\ncourts \u201cbecame effective\u201d while the case was pending\nbefore us, ibid., and made no explicit reference to pending\ncases. Because the statute \u201cdid not reserve jurisdiction\nover pending cases,\u201d id., at 115, we held that it clearly\nousted jurisdiction over them. Summarizing centuries of\npractice, we said: \u201cThis rule\u2014that, when a law conferring\njurisdiction is repealed without any reservation as to\npending cases, all cases fall with the law\u2014has been ad\nhered to consistently by this Court.\u201d Id., at 116\u2013117. See\nalso Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 274\n(1994) (opinion for the Court by STEVENS, J.) (\u201cWe have\nregularly applied intervening statutes conferring or oust\ning jurisdiction, whether or not jurisdiction lay when the\nunderlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n  This venerable rule that statutes ousting jurisdiction\nterminate jurisdiction in pending cases is not, as today\u2019s\nopinion for the Court would have it, a judge-made \u201cpre\nsumption against jurisdiction,\u201d ante, at 11, that we have\ninvented to resolve an ambiguity in the statutes. It is\nsimple recognition of the reality that the plain import of a\nstatute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to\nconsider and render judgment\u2014in an already pending\ncase no less than in a case yet to be filed.\n    \u201cWithout jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all\n    in any cause. Jurisdiction is power to declare the law,\n    and when it ceases to exist, the only function remain\n    ing to the court is that of announcing the fact and\n    dismissing the cause. And this is not less clear upon\n    authority than upon principle.\u201d Ex parte McCardle,\n    7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869) (emphasis added).\n  To alter this plain meaning, our cases have required an\nexplicit reservation of pending cases in the jurisdiction-\nrepealing statute. For example, Bruner, as mentioned,\nlooked to whether Congress made \u201cany reservation as to\npending cases.\u201d 343 U. S., at 116\u2013117; see also id., at 115\n(\u201cCongress made no provision for cases pending at the\neffective date of the Act withdrawing jurisdiction and, for\nthis reason, Courts of Appeals ordered pending cases\nterminated for want of jurisdiction\u201d). Likewise, in Hallo\nwell v. Commons, 239 U. S. 506 (1916), Justice Holmes\nrelied on the fact that the jurisdiction-ousting provision\n\u201cmade no exception for pending litigation, but purported to\nbe universal,\u201d id., at 508. And in Insurance Co. v. Ritchie,\n5 Wall. 541 (1867), we again relied on the fact that the\njurisdictional repeal was made \u201cwithout any saving of\nsuch causes as that before us,\u201d id., at 544. As in Bruner,\nHallowell, and Ritchie, the DTA\u2019s directive that \u201cno court,\njustice, or judge shall have jurisdiction,\u201d \u00a71005(e)(1), 119\nStat. 2742, is made \u201cwithout any reservation as to pending\n4                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncases\u201d and \u201cpurport[s] to be universal.\u201d What we stated in\nan earlier case remains true here: \u201c[W]hen, if it had been\nthe intention to confine the operation of [the jurisdictional\nrepeal] . . . to cases not pending, it would have been so\neasy to have said so, we must presume that Congress\nmeant the language employed should have its usual and\nordinary signification, and that the old law should be\nunconditionally repealed.\u201d Railroad Co. v. Grant, 98 U. S.\n398, 403 (1879).\n   The Court claims that I \u201crea[d] too much into\u201d the\nBruner line of cases, ante, at 12, n. 7, and that \u201cthe Bruner\nrule\u201d has never been \u201can inflexible trump,\u201d ante, at 19.\nBut the Court sorely misdescribes Bruner\u2014as if it were a\nkind of early-day Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320 (1997),\nresolving statutory ambiguity by oblique negative infer\nence. On the contrary, as described above, Bruner stated\nits holding as an unqualified \u201crule,\u201d which \u201chas been ad\nhered to consistently by this Court.\u201d 343 U. S., at 116\u2013\n117. Though Bruner referred to an express savings clause\nelsewhere in the statute, id., at 115, n. 7, it disavowed any\nreliance on such oblique indicators to vary the plain mean\ning, quoting Ritchie at length: \u201c \u2018It is quite possible that\nthis effect of the [jurisdiction-stripping statute] was not\ncontemplated by Congress. . . . [B]ut when terms are\nunambiguous we may not speculate on probabilities of\nintention.\u2019 \u201d 343 U. S., at 116 (quoting 5 Wall., at 544\u2013\n545).\n   The Court also attempts to evade the Bruner line of\ncases by asserting that \u201cthe \u2018presumption\u2019 [of application\nto pending cases] that these cases have applied is more\naccurately viewed as the nonapplication of another pre\nsumption\u2014viz., the presumption against retroactivity\u2014in\ncertain limited circumstances.\u201d Ante, at 11. I have al\nready explained that what the Court calls a \u201cpresumption\u201d\nis simply the acknowledgment of the unambiguous mean\ning of such provisions. But even taking it to be what the\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

Prospective applications of a statute are \u201ceffective\u201d\nupon the statute\u2019s effective date; that is what an effective-\ndate provision like \u00a71005(h)(1) means.1 \u201c \u2018[S]hall take\neffect upon enactment\u2019 is presumed to mean \u2018shall have\nprospective effect upon enactment,\u2019 and that presumption\nis too strong to be overcome by any negative inference\n[drawn from other provisions of the statute].\u201d Landgraf,\n511 U. S., at 288 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgments).\nThe Court\u2019s \u201cnonapplication of . . . the presumption\nagainst retroactivity\u201d to \u00a71005(e)(1) is thus just another\nway of stating that the statute takes immediate effect in\npending cases.\n  Though the Court resists the Bruner rule, it cannot cite\na single case in the history of Anglo-American law (before\ntoday) in which a jurisdiction-stripping provision was\ndenied immediate effect in pending cases, absent an ex\nplicit statutory reservation. By contrast, the cases grant\ning such immediate effect are legion, and they repeatedly\nrely on the plain language of the jurisdictional repeal as\nan \u201cinflexible trump,\u201d ante, at 19, by requiring an express\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Court apparently believes that the effective-date provision\n\nmeans nothing at all. \u201cThat paragraph (1), along with paragraphs (2)\nand (3), is to \u2018take effect on the date of enactment,\u2019 DTA \u00a71005(h)(1),\n119 Stat. 2743, is not dispositive,\u201d says the Court, ante, at 14, n. 9. The\nCourt\u2019s authority for this conclusion is its quote from INS v. St. Cyr,\n533 U. S. 289, 317 (2001), to the effect that \u201ca statement that a statute\nwill become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest\nthat it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.\u201d\nAnte, at 14, n. 9 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted).\nBut this quote merely restates the obvious: An effective-date provision\ndoes not render a statute applicable to \u201cconduct that occurred at an\nearlier date,\u201d but of course it renders the statute applicable to conduct\nthat occurs on the effective date and all future dates\u2014such as the\nCourt\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction here. The Court seems to suggest that,\nbecause the effective-date provision does not authorize retroactive\napplication, it also fails to authorize prospective application (and is\nthus useless verbiage). This cannot be true.\n6                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nreservation to save pending cases. See, e.g., Bruner, su\npra, at 115; Kline v.

Specifically, it appeals to the fact that\n\u00a71005(e)(2) and (e)(3) are explicitly made applicable to\npending cases (by \u00a71005(h)(2)). A negative inference of the\nsort the Court relies upon might clarify the meaning of an\nambiguous provision, but since the meaning of \u00a71005(e)(1)\nis entirely clear, the omitted language in that context\nwould have been redundant.\n   Even if \u00a71005(e)(1) were at all ambiguous in its applica\ntion to pending cases, the \u201cnegative inference\u201d from\n\u00a71005(h)(2) touted by the Court would have no force. The\nnumerous cases in the Bruner line would at least create a\npowerful default \u201cpresumption against jurisdiction,\u201d ante,\nat 11.

Murphy,\n521 U. S. 320 (1997), is utterly misplaced. Lindh involved\ntwo provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA): a set of amendments to\nchapter 153 of the federal habeas statute that redefined\nthe scope of collateral review by federal habeas courts; and\na provision creating a new chapter 154 in the habeas\nstatute specially to govern federal collateral review of\nstate capital cases. See 521 U. S., at 326\u2013327. The latter\nprovision explicitly rendered the new chapter 154 applica\nble to cases pending at the time of AEDPA\u2019s enactment;\nthe former made no specific reference to pending cases.\nId., at 327. In Lindh, we drew a negative inference from\nchapter 154\u2019s explicit reference to pending cases, to con\nclude that the chapter 153 amendments did not apply in\npending cases. It was essential to our reasoning, however,\nthat both provisions appeared to be identically difficult to\nclassify under our retroactivity cases. First, we noted\nthat, after Landgraf, there was reason for Congress to\nsuppose that an explicit statement was required to render\nthe amendments to chapter 154 applicable in pending\ncases, because the new chapter 154 \u201cwill have substantive\nas well as purely procedural effects.\u201d 521 U. S., at 327.\nThe next step\u2014and the critical step\u2014in our reasoning was\nthat Congress had identical reason to suppose that an\nexplicit statement would be required to apply the chapter\n153 amendments to pending cases, but did not provide it.\nId., at 329. The negative inference of Lindh rested on the\nfact that \u201c[n]othing . . . but a different intent explain[ed]\nthe different treatment.\u201d Ibid.\n8                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   Here, by contrast, there is ample reason for the different\ntreatment. The exclusive-review provisions of the DTA,\nunlike both \u00a71005(e)(1) and the AEDPA amendments in\nLindh, confer new jurisdiction (in the D. C. Circuit) where\nthere was none before. For better or for worse, our recent\ncases have contrasted jurisdiction-creating provisions with\njurisdiction-ousting provisions, retaining the venerable\nrule that the latter are not retroactive even when applied\nin pending cases, but strongly indicating that the former\nare typically retroactive. For example, we stated in\nHughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer, 520\nU. S. 939, 951 (1997), that a statute \u201cthat creates jurisdic\ntion where none previously existed\u201d is \u201cas much subject to\nour presumption against retroactivity as any other.\u201d See\nalso Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U. S. 677, 695\n(2004) (opinion for the Court by STEVENS, J.); id., at 722\n(KENNEDY, J., dissenting). The Court gives our retroactiv\nity jurisprudence a dazzling clarity in asserting that \u201csub\nsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) \u2018confer\u2019 jurisdiction in a manner\nthat cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions\nunder our precedents.\u201d2 Ante, at 17\u201318.

Any\n     test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement\n     in hard cases, and is unlikely to classify the enormous\n     variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical\n     clarity. However, retroactivity is a matter on which\n     judges tend to have \u2018sound . . . instinct[s],\u2019 . . . and fa\n     miliar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reli\n     ance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance.\u201d\n     Landgraf, 511 U.

S. 1, 8 (1946) (emphasis\nadded). See also Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763, 786\u2013787 (1950).\nThus, contrary to the Court\u2019s suggestion, ante, at 17, subsections (e)(2)\nand (e)(3) confer new jurisdiction: They impose judicial oversight on a\ntraditionally unreviewable exercise of military authority by the Com\nmander in Chief. They arguably \u201cspea[k] not just to the power of a\nparticular court but to . . . substantive rights . . . as well,\u201d Hughes\nAircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Shumer, 520 U. S. 939, 951 (1997)\u2014\nnamely, the unreviewable powers of the President. Our recent cases\nhad reiterated that the Executive is protected by the presumption\nagainst retroactivity in such comparatively trivial contexts as suits for\ntax refunds and increased pay, see Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511\nU. S. 244, 271, n. 25 (1994).\n10                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nCourt stubbornly disregards. It is utterly beyond question\nthat \u00a71005(e)(2)\u2019s and (3)\u2019s application to pending cases\n(without explicit specification) was not as clear as\n\u00a71005(e)(1)\u2019s. That is alone enough to explain the differ\nence in treatment.\n   Another obvious reason for the specification was to stave\noff any Suspension Clause problems raised by the imme\ndiately effective ouster of jurisdiction brought about by\nsubsection (e)(1). That is to say, specification of the im\nmediate effectiveness of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3)\n(which, unlike subsection (e)(1), would not fall within the\nBruner rule and would not automatically be deemed appli\ncable in pending cases) could reasonably have been\nthought essential to be sure of replacing the habeas juris\ndiction that subsection (e)(1) eliminated in pending cases\nwith an adequate substitute. See infra, at 16\u201318.\n   These considerations by no means prove that an explicit\nstatement would be required to render subsections (e)(2)\nand (e)(3) applicable in pending cases. But they surely\ngave Congress ample reason to doubt that their applica\ntion in pending cases would unfold as naturally as the\nCourt glibly assumes. In any event, even if it were true\nthat subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) \u201c \u2018confer\u2019 jurisdiction in a\nmanner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity\nquestions,\u201d ante, at 17\u201318, this would merely establish\nthat subsection (h)(2)\u2019s reference to pending cases was\nwholly superfluous when applied to subsections (e)(2) and\n(e)(3), just as it would have been for subsection (e)(1).\nLindh\u2019s negative inference makes sense only when Con\ngress would have perceived \u201cthe wisdom of being explicit\u201d\nwith respect to the immediate application of both of two\nstatutory provisions, 521 U. S., at 328, but chose to be\nexplicit only for one of them\u2014not when it would have\nperceived no need to be explicit for both, but enacted a\nredundancy only for one.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           11\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   In short, it is simply untrue that Congress \u201c \u2018should have\nbeen just as concerned about\u2019 \u201d specifying the application\nof \u00a71005(e)(1) to pending cases, ante, at 14 (quoting Lindh,\n521 U. S., at 329). In fact, the negative-inference ap\nproach of Lindh is particularly inappropriate in this case,\nbecause the negative inference from \u00a71005(h)(2) would\ntend to defeat the purpose of the very provisions that are\nexplicitly rendered applicable in pending cases, \u00a71005(e)(2)\nand (3). Those provisions purport to vest \u201cexclusive\u201d\njurisdiction in the D. C. Circuit to consider the claims\nraised by petitioners here. See infra, at 16\u201318. By draw\ning a negative inference \u00e0 la Lindh, the Court supplants\nthis exclusive-review mechanism with a dual-review\nmechanism for petitioners who were expeditious enough to\nfile applications challenging the CSRTs or military com\nmissions before December 30, 2005. Whatever the force of\nLindh\u2019s negative inference in other cases, it surely should\nnot apply here to defeat the purpose of the very provision\nfrom which the negative inference is drawn.\n                             C\n   Worst of all is the Court\u2019s reliance on the legislative\nhistory of the DTA to buttress its implausible reading of\n\u00a71005(e)(1). We have repeatedly held that such reliance is\nimpermissible where, as here, the statutory language is\nunambiguous. But the Court nevertheless relies both on\nfloor statements from the Senate and (quite heavily) on\nthe drafting history of the DTA. To begin with floor\nstatements: The Court urges that some \u201cstatements made\nby Senators preceding passage of the Act lend further\nsupport to\u201d the Court\u2019s interpretation, citing excerpts from\nthe floor debate that support its view, ante, 15\u201316, n. 10.\nThe Court immediately goes on to discount numerous floor\nstatements by the DTA\u2019s sponsors that flatly contradict its\nview, because \u201cthose statements appear to have been\ninserted into the Congressional Record after the Senate\n12                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ndebate.\u201d Ibid. Of course this observation, even if true,\nmakes no difference unless one indulges the fantasy that\nSenate floor speeches are attended (like the Philippics of\nDemosthenes) by throngs of eager listeners, instead of\nbeing delivered (like Demosthenes\u2019 practice sessions on\nthe beach) alone into a vast emptiness. Whether the floor\nstatements are spoken where no Senator hears, or written\nwhere no Senator reads, they represent at most the views\nof a single Senator. In any event, the Court greatly exag\ngerates the one-sidedness of the portions of the floor de\nbate that clearly occurred before the DTA\u2019s enactment.\nSome of the statements of Senator Graham, a sponsor of\nthe bill, only make sense on the assumption that pending\ncases are covered.3 And at least one opponent of the DTA\nunmistakably expressed his understanding that it would\nterminate our jurisdiction in this very case.4 (Of course in\nits discussion of legislative history the Court wholly ig\nnores the President\u2019s signing statement, which explicitly\nset forth his understanding that the DTA ousted jurisdic\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 \u201cBecause I have described how outrageous these claims are\u2014about\n\nthe exercise regime, the reading materials\u2014most Americans would be\nhighly offended to know that terrorists are suing us in our own courts\nabout what they read.\u201d 151 Cong.

These state\nments were made when Members of Congress were fully\naware that our continuing jurisdiction over this very case\nwas at issue. The question was divisive, and floor state\nments made on both sides were undoubtedly opportunistic\nand crafted solely for use in the briefs in this very litiga\ntion. See, e.g., 151 Cong. Rec. S14257\u2013S14258 (Dec. 21,\n2005) (statement of Sen. Levin) (arguing against a reading\nthat would \u201cstri[p] the Federal courts of jurisdiction to\nconsider pending cases, including the Hamdan case now\npending in the Supreme Court,\u201d and urging that Lindh\nrequires the same negative inference that the Court in\ndulges today (emphasis added)). The Court\u2019s reliance on\nsuch statements cannot avoid the appearance of similar\nopportunism. In a virtually identical context, the author\nof today\u2019s opinion has written for the Court that \u201c[t]he\nlegislative history discloses some frankly partisan state\nments about the meaning of the final effective date lan\nguage, but those statements cannot plausibly be read as\nreflecting any general agreement.\u201d Landgraf, 511 U.

Likewise, the\nhandful of floor statements that the Court treats as au\nthoritative do not \u201creflec[t] any general agreement.\u201d They\nreflect the now-common tactic\u2014which the Court once\nagain rewards\u2014of pursuing through floor-speech ipse dixit\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 \u201c[T]he executive branch shall construe section 1005 to preclude the\n\nFederal courts from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over any\nexisting or future action, including applications for writs of habeas\ncorpus, described in section 1005.\u201d President\u2019s Statement on Signing\nof H.

Not so for its\nreliance on the DTA\u2019s drafting history, which is displayed\nprominently, see ante, at 14\u201315. I have explained else\nwhere that such drafting history is no more legitimate or\nreliable an indicator of the objective meaning of a statute\nthan any other form of legislative history. This case pre\nsents a textbook example of its unreliability. The Court,\nante, at 14, trumpets the fact that a bill considered in the\nSenate included redundant language, not included in the\nDTA as passed, reconfirming that the abolition of habeas\njurisdiction \u201cshall apply to any application or other action\nthat is pending on or after the date of the enactment of\nthis Act.\u201d 151 Cong. Rec. S12655 (Nov. 10, 2005). But this\nearlier version of the bill also differed from the DTA in\nother material respects. Most notably, it provided for\npostdecision review by the D. C. Circuit only of the deci\nsions of CSRTs, not military commissions, ibid.; and it\nlimited that review to whether \u201cthe status determination\n. . . was consistent with the procedures and standards\nspecified by the Secretary of Defense,\u201d ibid., not whether\n\u201cthe use of such standards and procedures . . . is consistent\nwith the Constitution and laws of the United States,\u201d DTA\n\u00a71005(e)(2)(C)(ii), 119 Stat. 2742. To say that what moved\nSenators to reject this earlier bill was the \u201caction that is\npending\u201d provision surpasses the intuitive powers of even\nthis Court\u2019s greatest Justices.6 And to think that the\nHouse and the President also had this rejection firmly in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The Court asserts that \u201cit cannot be said that the changes to subsec\n\ntion (h)(2) were inconsequential,\u201d ante, at 15, n. 10, but the Court\u2019s sole\nevidence is the self-serving floor statements that it selectively cites.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

As always\u2014but especially in the context\nof strident, partisan legislative conflict of the sort that\ncharacterized enactment of this legislation\u2014the language\nof the statute that was actually passed by both Houses of\nCongress and signed by the President is our only authori\ntative and only reliable guidepost.\n                              D\n   A final but powerful indication of the fact that the Court\nhas made a mess of this statute is the nature of the conse\nquences that ensue. Though this case concerns a habeas\napplication challenging a trial by military commission,\nDTA \u00a71005(e)(1) strips the courts of jurisdiction to hear or\nconsider any \u201capplication for a writ of habeas corpus filed\nby or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of\nDefense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\u201d The vast majority of\npending petitions, no doubt, do not relate to military\ncommissions at all, but to more commonly challenged\naspects of \u201cdetention\u201d such as the terms and conditions of\nconfinement. See Rasul v. Bush, 542 U. S. 466, 498 (2004)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting). The Solicitor General represents\nthat \u201c[h]abeas petitions have been filed on behalf of a\npurported 600 [Guantanamo Bay] detainees,\u201d including\none that \u201cseek[s] relief on behalf of every Guantanamo\ndetainee who has not already filed an action,\u201d Respon\ndents\u2019 Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction 20, n. 10\n(hereinafter Motion to Dismiss). The Court\u2019s interpreta\ntion transforms a provision abolishing jurisdiction over all\nGuantanamo-related habeas petitions into a provision that\nretains jurisdiction over cases sufficiently numerous to\nkeep the courts busy for years to come.\n                            II\n  Because I would hold that \u00a71005(e)(1) unambiguously\nterminates the jurisdiction of all courts to \u201chear or con\nsider\u201d pending habeas applications, I must confront peti\n16                 HAMDAN v.

S.\n763, 768 (1950):\n     \u201cWe are cited to no instance where a court, in this or\n     any other country where the writ is known, has issued\n     it on behalf of an alien enemy who, at no relevant\n     time and in no stage of his captivity, has been within\n     its territorial jurisdiction. Nothing in the text of the\n     Constitution extends such a right, nor does anything\n     in our statutes.\u201d\nNotwithstanding the ill-considered dicta in the Court\u2019s\nopinion in Rasul, 542 U. S., at 480\u2013481, it is clear that\nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba, is outside the sovereign \u201cterrito\nrial jurisdiction\u201d of the United States. See id., at 500\u2013505\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting). Petitioner, an enemy alien de\ntained abroad, has no rights under the Suspension Clause.\n  But even if petitioner were fully protected by the\nClause, the DTA would create no suspension problem.\nThis Court has repeatedly acknowledged that \u201cthe substi\ntution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate\nnor ineffective to test the legality of a person\u2019s detention\ndoes not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas\ncorpus.\u201d Swain v.

Order No. 1 establishes commis\nsions, \u00a72; delineates their jurisdiction, \u00a73; provides for\ntheir officers, \u00a74(A); provides for their prosecution and\ndefense counsel, \u00a74(B), (C); lays out all their procedures,\nboth pretrial and trial, \u00a75(A)\u2013(P), \u00a76(A)\u2013(G); and provides\nfor posttrial military review through the Secretary of\nDefense and the President, \u00a76(H). In short, the \u201cstandards\nand procedures specified in\u201d Order No. 1 include every\naspect of the military commissions, including the fact of\ntheir existence and every respect in which they differ from\ncourts-martial. Petitioner\u2019s claims that the President\nlacks legal authority to try him before a military commis\nsion constitute claims that \u201cthe use of such standards and\nprocedures,\u201d as specified in Order No. 1, is \u201c[in]consistent\nwith the Constitution and laws of the United States,\u201d DTA\n\u00a71005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 119 Stat. 2743. The D. C. Circuit thus\nretains jurisdiction to consider these claims on postdeci\nsion review, and the Government does not dispute that the\nDTA leaves unaffected our certiorari jurisdiction under 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71254(1) to review the D. C. Circuit\u2019s decisions.\nMotion to Dismiss 16, n. 8. Thus, the DTA merely defers\n18                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nour jurisdiction to consider petitioner\u2019s claims; it does not\neliminate that jurisdiction. It constitutes neither an\n\u201cinadequate\u201d nor an \u201cineffective\u201d substitute for petitioner\u2019s\npending habeas application.7\n   Though it does not squarely address the issue, the Court\nhints ominously that \u201cthe Government\u2019s preferred read\ning\u201d would \u201crais[e] grave questions about Congress\u2019 au\nthority to impinge upon this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction,\nparticularly in habeas cases.\u201d Ante, at 10\u201311 (citing Ex\nparte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85 (1869); Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S.\n651 (1996); Durousseau v. United States, 6 Cranch 307\n(1810); United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128 (1872); and Ex\nparte McCardle, 7 Wall. 506). It is not clear how there\ncould be any such lurking questions, in light of the aptly\nnamed \u201cExceptions Clause\u201d of Article III, \u00a72, which, in\nmaking our appellate jurisdiction subject to \u201csuch Excep\ntions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall\nmake,\u201d explicitly permits exactly what Congress has done\nhere. But any doubt our prior cases might have created on\nthis score is surely chimerical in this case. As just noted,\nthe exclusive-review provisions provide a substitute for\nhabeas review adequate to satisfy the Suspension Clause,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 Petitioner also urges that he could be subject to indefinite delay if\n\nmilitary officials and the President are deliberately dilatory in review\ning the decision of his commission. In reviewing the constitutionality of\nlegislation, we generally presume that the Executive will implement its\nprovisions in good faith. And it is unclear in any event that delay\nwould inflict any injury on petitioner, who (after an adverse determina\ntion by his CSRT, see 344 F. Supp. 2d 152, 161 (DC 2004)) is already\nsubject to indefinite detention under our decision in Hamdi v. Rums\nfeld, 542 U. S. 507 (2004). Moreover, the mere possibility of delay does\nnot render an alternative remedy \u201cinadequate [o]r ineffective to test the\nlegality\u201d of a military commission trial. Swain v. Pressley, 430 U. S.\n372, 381 (1977). In an analogous context, we discounted the notion that\npostponement of relief until postconviction review inflicted any cogni\nzable injury on a serviceman charged before a military court-martial.\nSchlesinger v. Councilman, 420 U. S. 738, 754\u2013755 (1975); see also\nYounger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, 46 (1971).\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

Traditionally,\nequitable principles govern both the exercise of habeas\njurisdiction and the granting of the injunctive relief sought\nby petitioner. See Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 U. S.\n738, 754 (1975); Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S.\n305, 311 (1982). In light of Congress\u2019s provision of an\nalternate avenue for petitioner\u2019s claims in \u00a71005(e)(3),\nthose equitable principles counsel that we abstain from\nexercising jurisdiction in this case.\n   In requesting abstention, the Government relies princi\npally on Councilman, in which we abstained from consid\nering a serviceman\u2019s claim that his charge for marijuana\npossession was not sufficiently \u201cservice-connected\u201d to\ntrigger the subject-matter jurisdiction of the military\ncourts-martial. See 420 U. S., at 740, 758. Admittedly,\nCouncilman does not squarely control petitioner\u2019s case,\nbut it provides the closest analogue in our jurisprudence.\nAs the Court describes, ante, at 21, Councilman \u201cidenti\nfie[d] two considerations of comity that together favor[ed]\nabstention pending completion of ongoing court-martial\nproceedings against service personnel.\u201d But the Court\nerrs in finding these considerations inapplicable to this\ncase. Both of them, and a third consideration not empha\nsized in Councilman, all cut in favor of abstention here.\n   First, the Court observes that Councilman rested in\npart on the fact that \u201cmilitary discipline and, therefore,\nthe efficient operation of the Armed Forces are best served\n20                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nif the military justice system acts without regular inter\nference from civilian courts,\u201d and concludes that \u201cHamdan\nis not a member of our Nation\u2019s Armed Forces, so concerns\nabout military discipline do not apply.\u201d Ante, at 22. This\nis true enough. But for some reason, the Court fails to\nmake any inquiry into whether military commission trials\nmight involve other \u201cmilitary necessities\u201d or \u201cunique mili\ntary exigencies,\u201d 420 U. S., at 757, comparable in gravity\nto those at stake in Councilman. To put this in context:\nThe charge against the respondent in Councilman was the\noff-base possession and sale of marijuana while he was\nstationed in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, see id., at 739\u2013740. The\ncharge against the petitioner here is joining and actively\nabetting the murderous conspiracy that slaughtered thou\nsands of innocent American civilians without warning on\nSeptember 11, 2001. While Councilman held that the\nprosecution of the former charge involved \u201cmilitary neces\nsities\u201d counseling against our interference, the Court does\nnot even ponder the same question for the latter charge.\n   The reason for the Court\u2019s \u201cblinkered study\u201d of this\nquestion, ante, at 19, is not hard to fathom. The principal\nopinion on the merits makes clear that it does not believe\nthat the trials by military commission involve any \u201cmili\ntary necessity\u201d at all: \u201cThe charge\u2019s shortcomings . . . are\nindicative of a broader inability on the Executive\u2019s part\nhere to satisfy the most basic precondition . . . for estab\nlishment of military commissions: military necessity.\u201d\nAnte, at 48. This is quite at odds with the views on this\nsubject expressed by our political branches. Because of\n\u201cmilitary necessity,\u201d a joint session of Congress authorized\nthe President to \u201cuse all necessary and appropriate force,\u201d\nincluding military commissions, \u201cagainst those nations,\norganizations, or persons [such as petitioner] he deter\nmines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terror\nist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.\u201d Au\nthorization for Use of Military Force, \u00a72(a), 115 Stat. 224,\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            21\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nnote following 50 U. S. C. \u00a71541 (2000 ed., Supp. III). In\nkeeping with this authority, the President has determined\nthat \u201c[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and\nfor the effective conduct of military operations and preven\ntion of terrorist attacks, it is necessary for individuals\nsubject to this order . . . to be detained, and, when tried, to\nbe tried for violations of the laws of war and other appli\ncable laws by military tribunals.\u201d Military Order of Nov.\n13, 2001, 3 CFR \u00a7918(e) (2002). It is not clear where the\nCourt derives the authority\u2014or the audacity\u2014to contra\ndict this determination. If \u201cmilitary necessities\u201d relating\nto \u201cduty\u201d and \u201cdiscipline\u201d required abstention in Council\nman, supra, at 757, military necessities relating to the\ndisabling, deterrence, and punishment of the mass-\nmurdering terrorists of September 11 require abstention\nall the more here.\n   The Court further seeks to distinguish Councilman on\nthe ground that \u201cthe tribunal convened to try Hamdan is\nnot part of the integrated system of military courts, com\nplete with independent review panels, that Congress has\nestablished.\u201d Ante, at 22. To be sure, Councilman empha\nsized that \u201cCongress created an integrated system of\nmilitary courts and review procedures, a critical element\nof which is the Court of Military Appeals consisting of\ncivilian judges completely removed from all military influ\nence or persuasion, who would gain over time thorough\nfamiliarity with military problems.\u201d 420 U. S., at 758\n(internal quotation marks and footnote omitted). The\nCourt contrasts this \u201cintegrated system\u201d insulated from\nmilitary influence with the review scheme established by\nOrder No. 1, which \u201cprovides that appeal of a review\npanel\u2019s decision may be had only to the Secretary of De\nfense himself, \u00a76(H)(5), and then, finally, to the President,\n\u00a76(H)(6).\u201d Ante, at 23.\n   Even if we were to accept the Court\u2019s extraordinary\nassumption that the President \u201clack[s] the structural\n22                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ninsulation from military influence that characterizes the\nCourt of Appeals for the Armed Forces,\u201d ante, at 23,8 the\nCourt\u2019s description of the review scheme here is anachro\nnistic. As of December 30, 2005, the \u201cfina[l]\u201d review of\ndecisions by military commissions is now conducted by the\nD. C. Circuit pursuant to \u00a71005(e)(3) of the DTA, and by\nthis Court under 28 U. S. C. \u00a71254(1). This provision for\nreview by Article III courts creates, if anything, a review\nscheme more insulated from Executive control than that in\nCouncilman.9 At the time we decided Councilman, Con\ngress had not \u201cconferred on any Art[icle] III court jurisdic\ntion directly to review court-martial determinations.\u201d 420\nU. S., at 746. The final arbiter of direct appeals was the\nCourt of Military Appeals (now the Court of Appeals for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The  very purpose of Article II\u2019s creation of a civilian Commander in\nChief in the President of the United States was to generate \u201cstructural\ninsulation from military influence.\u201d See The Federalist No. 28 (A. Hamil\nton); id., No. 69 (same). We do not live under a military junta. It is a\ndisservice to both those in the Armed Forces and the President to suggest\nthat the President is subject to the undue control of the military.\n   9 In rejecting our analysis, the Court observes that appeals to the\n\nD. C. Circuit under subsection (e)(3) are discretionary, rather than as of\nright, when the military commission imposes a sentence less than 10\nyears\u2019 imprisonment, see ante, at 23, n. 19, 52\u201353; \u00a71005(e)(3)(B), 119\nStat. 2743. The relevance of this observation to the abstention question\nis unfathomable. The fact that Article III review is discretionary does\nnot mean that it lacks \u201cstructural insulation from military influence,\u201d\nante, at 23, and its discretionary nature presents no obstacle to the\ncourts\u2019 future review these cases.\n   The Court might more cogently have relied on the discretionary na\nture of review to argue that the statute provides an inadequate substi\ntute for habeas review under the Suspension Clause. See supra, at 16\u2013\n18. But this argument would have no force, even if all appeals to the\nD. C. Circuit were discretionary. The exercise of habeas jurisdiction\nhas traditionally been entirely a matter of the court\u2019s equitable discre\ntion, see Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 715\u2013718 (1993) (SCALIA,\nJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part), so the fact that habeas\njurisdiction is replaced by discretionary appellate review does not\nrender the substitution \u201cinadequate.\u201d Swain, 430 U. S., at 381.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           23\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe Armed Forces), an Article I court whose members\npossessed neither life tenure, nor salary protection, nor\nthe constitutional protection from removal provided to\nfederal judges in Article III, \u00a71. See 10 U. S. C. \u00a7867(a)(2)\n(1970 ed.).\n  Moreover, a third consideration counsels strongly in\nfavor of abstention in this case. Councilman reasoned\nthat the \u201cconsiderations of comity, the necessity of respect\nfor coordinate judicial systems\u201d that motivated our deci\nsion in Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971), were inap\nplicable to courts-martial, because \u201cthe particular de\nmands of federalism are not implicated.\u201d 420 U. S., at\n756, 757. Though military commissions likewise do not\nimplicate \u201cthe particular demands of federalism,\u201d consid\nerations of interbranch comity at the federal level weigh\nheavily against our exercise of equity jurisdiction in this\ncase. Here, apparently for the first time in history, see\nMotion to Dismiss 6, a District Court enjoined ongoing\nmilitary commission proceedings, which had been deemed\n\u201cnecessary\u201d by the President \u201c[t]o protect the United\nStates and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of\nmilitary operations and prevention of terrorist attacks.\u201d\nMilitary Order of Nov. 13, 3 CFR \u00a7918(e). Such an order\nbrings the Judicial Branch into direct conflict with the\nExecutive in an area where the Executive\u2019s competence is\nmaximal and ours is virtually nonexistent. We should\nexercise our equitable discretion to avoid such conflict.\nInstead, the Court rushes headlong to meet it. Elsewhere,\nwe have deferred exercising habeas jurisdiction until state\ncourts have \u201cthe first opportunity to review\u201d a petitioner\u2019s\nclaim, merely to \u201creduc[e] friction between the state and\nfederal court systems.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U. S.\n838, 844, 845 (1999). The \u201cfriction\u201d created today between\nthis Court and the Executive Branch is many times more\nserious.\n  In the face of such concerns, the Court relies heavily on\n24                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nEx parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942): \u201cFar from abstaining\npending the conclusion of military proceedings, which\nwere ongoing, [in Quirin] we convened a special Term to\nhear the case and expedited our review.\u201d Ante, at 24. It is\nlikely that the Government in Quirin, unlike here, pre\nferred a hasty resolution of the case in this Court, so that\nit could swiftly execute the sentences imposed, see Hamdi\nv. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 569 (2004) (SCALIA, J., dissent\ning). But the Court\u2019s reliance on Quirin suffers from a\nmore fundamental defect: Once again, it ignores the DTA,\nwhich creates an avenue for the consideration of peti\ntioner\u2019s claims that did not exist at the time of Quirin.\nCollateral application for habeas review was the only\nvehicle available. And there was no compelling reason to\npostpone consideration of the Quirin application until the\ntermination of military proceedings, because the only\ncognizable claims presented were general challenges to the\nauthority of the commissions that would not be affected by\nthe specific proceedings. See supra, at 8\u20139, n. 2. In the\nDTA, by contrast, Congress has expanded the scope of\nArticle III review and has channeled it exclusively through\na single, postverdict appeal to Article III courts. Because\nCongress has created a novel unitary scheme of Article III\nreview of military commissions that was absent in 1942,\nQuirin is no longer governing precedent.\n   I would abstain from exercising our equity jurisdiction,\nas the Government requests.\n                        *    *      * \n\n     For the foregoing reasons, I dissent. \n\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

The Court having\nconcluded otherwise, it is appropriate to respond to the\nCourt\u2019s resolution of the merits of petitioner\u2019s claims\nbecause its opinion openly flouts our well-established duty\nto respect the Executive\u2019s judgment in matters of military\noperations and foreign affairs. The Court\u2019s evident belief\nthat it is qualified to pass on the \u201c[m]ilitary necessity,\u201d\nante, at 48, of the Commander in Chief\u2019s decision to em\nploy a particular form of force against our enemies is so\nantithetical to our constitutional structure that it simply\ncannot go unanswered. I respectfully dissent.\n                              I\n  Our review of petitioner\u2019s claims arises in the context of\nthe President\u2019s wartime exercise of his commander-in\nchief authority in conjunction with the complete support of\nCongress. Accordingly, it is important to take measure of\nthe respective roles the Constitution assigns to the three\nbranches of our Government in the conduct of war.\n  As I explained in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507\n2                   HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n(2004), the structural advantages attendant to the Execu\ntive Branch\u2014namely, the decisiveness, \u201c \u2018activity, secrecy,\nand dispatch\u2019 \u201d that flow from the Executive\u2019s \u201c \u2018unity,\u2019 \u201d id.,\nat 581 (dissenting opinion) (quoting The Federalist No. 70,\np. 472 (J.

II, \u00a71, provides that he \u201cshall be Com\nmander in Chief\u201d of the Armed Forces, \u00a72, and places in\nhim the power to recognize foreign governments, \u00a73. This\nCourt has observed that these provisions confer upon the\nPresident broad constitutional authority to protect the\nNation\u2019s security in the manner he deems fit. See, e.g.,\nPrize Cases, 2 Black 635, 668 (1863) (\u201cIf a war be made by\ninvasion of a foreign nation, the President is not only\nauthorized but bound to resist force by force . . . without\nwaiting for any special legislative authority\u201d); Fleming v.\nPage, 9 How. 603, 615 (1850) (acknowledging that the\nPresident has the authority to \u201cemploy [the Nation\u2019s\nArmed Forces] in the manner he may deem most effectual\nto harass and conquer and subdue the enemy\u201d).\n   Congress, to be sure, has a substantial and essential\nrole in both foreign affairs and national security. But\n\u201cCongress cannot anticipate and legislate with regard to\nevery possible action the President may find it necessary\nto take or every possible situation in which he might act,\u201d\nand \u201c[s]uch failure of Congress . . . does not, \u2018especially . . .\nin the areas of foreign policy and national security,\u2019 imply\n\u2018congressional disapproval\u2019 of action taken by the Execu\ntive.\u201d Dames & Moore v.

S. 1, 25 (1942).\n    Under this framework, the President\u2019s decision to try\nHamdan before a military commission for his involvement\nwith al Qaeda is entitled to a heavy measure of deference.\nIn the present conflict, Congress has authorized the Presi\ndent \u201cto use all necessary and appropriate force against\nthose nations, organizations, or persons he determines\nplanned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist\nattacks that occurred on September 11, 2001 . . . in order\nto prevent any future acts of international terrorism\nagainst the United States by such nations, organizations\nor persons.\u201d Authorization for Use of Military Force\n4                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n(AUMF) 115 Stat. 224, note following 50 U. S. C. \u00a71541\n(2000 ed., Supp. III) (emphasis added). As a plurality of\nthe Court observed in Hamdi, the \u201ccapture, detention, and\ntrial of unlawful combatants, by \u2018universal agreement and\npractice,\u2019 are \u2018important incident[s] of war,\u2019 \u201d Hamdi, 542\nU. S., at 518 (quoting Quirin, supra, at 28, 30; emphasis\nadded), and are therefore \u201can exercise of the \u2018necessary\nand appropriate force\u2019 Congress has authorized the Presi\ndent to use.\u201d Hamdi, 542 U. S., at 518; id., at 587 (THO\nMAS, J., dissenting). Hamdi\u2019s observation that military\ncommissions are included within the AUMF\u2019s authoriza\ntion is supported by this Court\u2019s previous recognition that\n\u201c[a]n important incident to the conduct of war is the adop\ntion of measures by the military commander, not only to\nrepel and defeat the enemy, but to seize and subject to\ndisciplinary measures those enemies who, in their attempt\nto thwart or impede our military effort, have violated the\nlaw of war.\u201d In re Yamashita, 327 U. S. 1, 11 (1946); see\nalso Quirin, supra, at 28\u201329; Madsen v. Kinsella, 343 U. S.\n341, 354, n. 20 (1952) (\u201c \u2018[T]he military commission . . . is\nan institution of the greatest importance in the period of\nwar and should be preserved\u2019 \u201d (quoting S. Rep. No. 229,\n63d Cong., 2d Sess., 53 (1914) (testimony of Gen. Crowder))).\n   Although the Court concedes the legitimacy of the Presi\ndent\u2019s use of military commissions in certain circum\nstances, ante, at 28, it suggests that the AUMF has no\nbearing on the scope of the President\u2019s power to utilize\nmilitary commissions in the present conflict, ante, at 29\u2013\n30. Instead, the Court determines the scope of this power\nbased exclusively on Article 21 of the Uniform Code of\nMilitary Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S. C. \u00a7821, the successor to\nArticle 15 of the Articles of War, which Quirin held \u201cau\nthorized trial of offenses against the law of war before\n[military] commissions.\u201d 317 U. S., at 29. As I shall dis\ncuss below, Article 21 alone supports the use of commis\nsions here. Nothing in the language of Article 21, how\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                     5\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\never, suggests that it outlines the entire reach of congres\nsional authorization of military commissions in all con\nflicts\u2014quite the contrary, the language of Article 21 pre\nsupposes the existence of military commissions under an\nindependent basis of authorization.1 Indeed, consistent\nwith Hamdi\u2019s conclusion that the AUMF itself authorizes\nthe trial of unlawful combatants, the original sanction for\nmilitary commissions historically derived from congres\nsional authorization of \u201cthe initiation of war\u201d with its\nattendant authorization of \u201cthe employment of all neces\nsary and proper agencies for its due prosecution.\u201d W.\nWinthrop, Military Law and Precedents 831 (2d ed. 1920)\n(hereinafter Winthrop). Accordingly, congressional au\nthorization for military commissions pertaining to the\ninstant conflict derives not only from Article 21 of the\nUCMJ, but also from the more recent, and broader, au\nthorization contained in the AUMF.2\n   I note the Court\u2019s error respecting the AUMF not be\ncause it is necessary to my resolution of this case\u2014\nHamdan\u2019s military commission can plainly be sustained\nsolely under Article 21\u2014but to emphasize the complete\ncongressional sanction of the President\u2019s exercise of his\ncommander-in-chief authority to conduct the present war.\nIn such circumstances, as previously noted, our duty to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 As previously noted, Article 15 of the Articles of War was the prede\n\ncessor of Article 21 of the UCMJ. Article 21 provides as follows: \u201cThe\nprovisions of this chapter conferring jurisdiction upon courts-martial do\nnot deprive military commissions, provost courts, or other military\ntribunals of concurrent jurisdiction with respect to offenders or offenses\nthat by statute or by the law of war may be tried by military commis\nsions, provost courts, or other military tribunals.\u201d 10 U. S. C. \u00a7821.\n   2 Although the President very well may have inherent authority to try\n\nunlawful combatants for violations of the law of war before military\ncommissions, we need not decide that question because Congress has\nauthorized the President to do so. Cf. Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S.\n507, 587 (2004) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (same conclusion respecting\ndetention of unlawful combatants).\n6                   HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ndefer to the Executive\u2019s military and foreign policy judg\nment is at its zenith; it does not countenance the kind of\nsecond-guessing the Court repeatedly engages in today.\nMilitary and foreign policy judgments\n    \u201c \u2018are and should be undertaken only by those directly\n    responsible to the people whose welfare they advance\n    or imperil. They are decisions of a kind for which the\n    Judiciary has neither aptitude, facilities nor responsi\n    bility and which has long been held to belong in the\n    domain of political power not subject to judicial intru\n    sion or inquiry.\u2019 \u201d Hamdi, supra, at 582\u2013583 (THOMAS,\n    J., dissenting) (quoting Chicago & Southern Air Lines,\n    Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 111 (1948)).\nIt is within this framework that the lawfulness of Ham\ndan\u2019s commission should be examined.\n                               II\n   The plurality accurately describes some aspects of the\nhistory of military commissions and the prerequisites for\ntheir use. Thus, I do not dispute that military commis\nsions have historically been \u201cused in three [different]\nsituations,\u201d ante, at 31\u201332, and that the only situation\nrelevant to the instant case is the use of military commis\nsions \u201c \u2018to seize and subject to disciplinary measures those\nenemies who . . . have violated the law of war,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 32\n(quoting Quirin, supra, at 28\u201329). Similarly, I agree with\nthe plurality that Winthrop\u2019s treatise sets forth the four\nrelevant considerations for determining the scope of a\nmilitary commission\u2019s jurisdiction, considerations relating\nto the (1) time and (2) place of the offense, (3) the status of\nthe offender, and (4) the nature of the offense charged.\nWinthrop 836\u2013840. The Executive has easily satisfied\nthese considerations here. The plurality\u2019s contrary con\nclusion rests upon an incomplete accounting and an un\nfaithful application of those considerations.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                               A\n   The first two considerations are that a law-of-war mili\ntary commission may only assume jurisdiction of \u201coffences\ncommitted within the field of the command of the conven\ning commander,\u201d and that such offenses \u201cmust have been\ncommitted within the period of the war.\u201d See id., at 836,\n837; ante, at 33. Here, as evidenced by Hamdan\u2019s charg\ning document, the Executive has determined that the\ntheater of the present conflict includes \u201cAfghanistan,\nPakistan and other countries\u201d where al Qaeda has estab\nlished training camps, App. to Pet. for Cert. 64a, and that\nthe duration of that conflict dates back (at least) to Usama\nbin Laden\u2019s August 1996 \u201cDeclaration of Jihad Against the\nAmericans,\u201d ibid. Under the Executive\u2019s description of the\nconflict, then, every aspect of the charge, which alleges\novert acts in \u201cAfghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen and other\ncountries\u201d taking place from 1996 to 2001, satisfies the\ntemporal and geographic prerequisites for the exercise of\nlaw-of-war military commission jurisdiction. Id., at 65a\u2013\n67a. And these judgments pertaining to the scope of the\ntheater and duration of the present conflict are committed\nsolely to the President in the exercise of his commander-\nin-chief authority. See Prize Cases, 2 Black, at 670 (con\ncluding that the President\u2019s commander-in-chief judgment\nabout the nature of a particular conflict was \u201ca question to\nbe decided by him, and this Court must be governed by the\ndecisions and acts of the political department of the Gov\nernment to which this power was entrusted\u201d).\n   Nevertheless, the plurality concludes that the legality of\nthe charge against Hamdan is doubtful because \u201cHamdan\nis charged not with an overt act for which he was caught\nredhanded in a theater of war . . . but with an agreement\nthe inception of which long predated . . . the [relevant\narmed conflict].\u201d Ante, at 48 (emphasis in original). The\nplurality\u2019s willingness to second-guess the Executive\u2019s judg\nments in this context, based upon little more than its un\n8                      HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsupported assertions, constitutes an unprecedented depar\nture from the traditionally limited role of the courts with\nrespect to war and an unwarranted intrusion on executive\nauthority. And even if such second-guessing were appropri\nate, the plurality\u2019s attempt to do so is unpersuasive.\n   As an initial matter, the plurality relies upon the date of\nthe AUMF\u2019s enactment to determine the beginning point\nfor the \u201cperiod of the war,\u201d Winthrop 836, thereby suggest\ning that petitioner\u2019s commission does not have jurisdiction\nto try him for offenses committed prior to the AUMF\u2019s\nenactment. Ante, at 34\u201336, 48. But this suggestion be\ntrays the plurality\u2019s unfamiliarity with the realities of\nwarfare and its willful blindness to our precedents. The\nstarting point of the present conflict (or indeed any con\nflict) is not determined by congressional enactment, but\nrather by the initiation of hostilities. See Prize Cases,\nsupra, at 668 (recognizing that war may be initiated by\n\u201cinvasion of a foreign nation,\u201d and that such initiation, and\nthe President\u2019s response, usually precedes congressional\naction). Thus, Congress\u2019 enactment of the AUMF did not\nmark the beginning of this Nation\u2019s conflict with al Qaeda,\nbut instead authorized the President to use force in the\nmidst of an ongoing conflict. Moreover, while the Presi\ndent\u2019s \u201cwar powers\u201d may not have been activated until the\nAUMF was passed, ante, 35, n. 31, the date of such activa\ntion has never been used to determine the scope of a mili\ntary commission\u2019s jurisdiction.3 Instead, the traditional\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Even if the formal declaration of war were generally the determina\n\ntive act in ascertaining the temporal reach of the jurisdiction of a\nmilitary commission, the AUMF itself is inconsistent with the plural\nity\u2019s suggestion that such a rule is appropriate in this case. See ante, at\n34\u201336, 48. The text of the AUMF is backward looking, authorizing the\nuse of \u201call necessary and appropriate force against those nations,\norganizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, commit\nted, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11,\n2001.\u201d Thus, the President\u2019s decision to try Hamdan by military\ncommission\u2014a use of force authorized by the AUMF\u2014for Hamdan\u2019s\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

J. Int\u2019l L. 832, 848 (1948) (hereinafter\nGreen); see also C. Howland, Digest of Opinions of the\nJudge-Advocates General of the Army 1067 (1912) (here\ninafter Howland) (\u201cA military commission . . . exercising\n. . . jurisdiction . . . under the laws of war . . . may take\ncognizance of offenses committed, during the war, before\nthe initiation of the military government or martial law\u201d\n(emphasis in original));4 cf. Yamashita, 327 U. S., at 13\n(\u201cThe extent to which the power to prosecute violations of\nthe law of war shall be exercised before peace is declared\nrests, not with the courts, but with the political branch of\nthe Government\u201d). Consistent with this principle, on facts\nvirtually identical to those here, a military commission\ntried Julius Otto Kuehn for conspiring with Japanese\nofficials to betray the United States Fleet to the Imperial\nJapanese Government prior to its attack on Pearl Harbor.\nGreen 848.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ninvolvement with al Qaeda prior to September 11, 2001, fits comforta\nbly within the framework of the AUMF. In fact, bringing the Septem\nber 11 conspirators to justice is the primary point of the AUMF. By\ncontrast, on the plurality\u2019s logic, the AUMF would not grant the Presi\ndent the authority to try Usama bin Laden himself for his involvement\nin the events of September 11, 2001.\n   4 The plurality suggests these authorities are inapplicable because\n\nnothing in its \u201canalysis turns on the admitted absence of either a\nformal declaration of war or a declaration of martial law. Our focus\ninstead is on the . . . AUMF.\u201d Ante, at 35, n. 31. The difference identi\nfied by the plurality is purely semantic. Both Green and Howland\nconfirm that the date of the enactment that establishes a legal basis for\nforming military commissions\u2014whether it be a declaration of war, a\ndeclaration of martial law, or an authorization to use military force\u2014\ndoes not limit the jurisdiction of military commissions to offenses\ncommitted after that date.\n   5 The plurality attempts to evade the import of this historical example\n\nby observing that Kuehn was tried before a martial law commission for\n10                       HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                           THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n  Moreover, the President\u2019s determination that the pre\nsent conflict dates at least to 1996 is supported by over\nwhelming evidence. According to the State Department,\nal Qaeda declared war on the United States as early as\nAugust 1996. See Dept. of State Fact Sheet: Usama bin\nLadin (Aug. 21, 1998); Dept. of State Fact Sheet: The\nCharges against International Terrorist Usama Bin Laden\n(Dec. 20, 2000); cf. Prize Cases, 2 Black, at 668 (recogniz\ning that a state of war exists even if \u201cthe declaration of it\nbe unilateral\u201d (emphasis in original)). In February 1998,\nal Qaeda leadership issued another statement ordering\nthe indiscriminate\u2014and, even under the laws of war as\napplied to legitimate nation-states, plainly illegal\u2014killing\nof American civilians and military personnel alike. See\nJihad Against Jews and Crusaders: World Islamic Front\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\na violation of federal espionage statutes. Ibid. As an initial matter, the\nfact that Kuehn was tried before a martial law commission for an\noffense committed prior to the establishment of martial law provides\nstrong support for the President\u2019s contention that he may try Hamdan\nfor offenses committed prior to the enactment of the AUMF. Here the\nAUMF serves the same function as the declaration of martial law in\nHawaii in 1941, establishing legal authority for the constitution of\nmilitary commissions. Moreover, Kuehn was not tried and punished\n\u201cby statute, but by the laws and usages of war.\u201d United States v.\nBernard Julius Otto Kuehn, Board of Review 5 (Office of the Military\nGovernor, Hawaii 1942). Indeed, in upholding the imposition of the\ndeath penalty, a sentence \u201cnot authorized by the Espionage statutes,\u201d\nibid., Kuehn\u2019s Board of Review explained that \u201c[t]he fact that persons\nmay be tried and punished . . . by a military commission for committing\nacts defined as offenses by . . . federal statutes does not mean that such\npersons are being tried for violations of such . . . statutes; they are,\ninstead, being tried for acts made offenses only by orders of the . . .\ncommanding general.\u201d Id., at 6. Lastly, the import of this example is\nnot undermined by Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 327 U. S. 304 (1946). The\nquestion before the Court in that case involved only whether \u201cloyal\ncivilians in loyal territory should have their daily conduct governed by\nmilitary orders,\u201d id., at 319; it did \u201cnot involve the well-established power\nof the military to exercise jurisdiction over . . . enemy belligerents,\u201d id., at\n313.\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

Swet\nnam, Usama bin Laden\u2019s al-Qaida: Profile of a Terrorist\nNetwork, App. 1B (2001) (\u201cThe ruling to kill the Ameri\ncans and their allies\u2014civilians and military\u2014is an indi\nvidual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country\nin which it is possible to do it\u201d). This was not mere rheto\nric; even before September 11, 2001, al Qaeda was in\nvolved in the bombing of the World Trade Center in New\nYork City in 1993, the bombing of the Khobar Towers in\nSaudi Arabia in 1996, the bombing of the U.

Based on the foregoing, the President\u2019s judgment\u2014\nthat the present conflict substantially predates the AUMF,\nextending at least as far back as al Qaeda\u2019s 1996 declara\ntion of war on our Nation, and that the theater of war\nextends at least as far as the localities of al Qaeda\u2019s prin\ncipal bases of operations\u2014is beyond judicial reproach.\nAnd the plurality\u2019s unsupportable contrary determination\nmerely confirms that \u201c \u2018the Judiciary has neither aptitude,\nfacilities nor responsibility\u2019 \u201d for making military or foreign\naffairs judgments.

Law-of-war military commis\nsions have jurisdiction over \u201c \u2018individuals of the enemy\u2019s\narmy who have been guilty of illegitimate warfare or other\noffences in violation of the laws of war,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 33-34\n12                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n(quoting Winthrop 838). They also have jurisdiction over\n\u201c[i]rregular armed bodies or persons not forming part of\nthe organized forces of a belligerent\u201d \u201cwho would not be\nlikely to respect the laws of war.\u201d Id., at 783, 784. Indeed,\naccording to Winthrop, such persons are not \u201cwithin the\nprotection of the laws of war\u201d and were \u201cliable to be shot,\nimprisoned, or banished, either summarily where their\nguilt was clear or upon trial and conviction by military\ncommission.\u201d Id., at 784. This consideration is easily satis\nfied here, as Hamdan is an unlawful combatant charged\nwith joining and conspiring with a terrorist network dedi\ncated to flouting the laws of war. 344 F. Supp. 2d 152, 161\n(DC 2004); App. to Pet. for Cert. 63a\u201367a.\n                              C\n   The fourth consideration relevant to the jurisdiction of\nlaw-of-war military commissions relates to the nature of\nthe offense charged. As relevant here, such commissions\nhave jurisdiction to try \u201c \u2018[v]iolations of the laws and us\nages of war cognizable by military tribunals only,\u2019 \u201d ante,\nat 34 (quoting Winthrop 839). In contrast to the preceding\nconsiderations, this Court\u2019s precedents establish that\njudicial review of \u201cwhether any of the acts charged is an\noffense against the law of war cognizable before a military\ntribunal\u201d is appropriate. Quirin, 317 U. S., at 29. How\never, \u201ccharges of violations of the law of war triable before\na military tribunal need not be stated with the precision of\na common law indictment.\u201d Yamashita, 327 U.

Gen.\n297, 310 (1865). Moreover, the common law of war is\nmarked by two important features. First, as with the\ncommon law generally, it is flexible and evolutionary in\nnature, building upon the experience of the past and\ntaking account of the exigencies of the present. Thus,\n\u201c[t]he law of war, like every other code of laws, declares\nwhat shall not be done, and does not say what may be\ndone. The legitimate use of the great power of war, or\nrather the prohibitions upon the use of that power, in\ncrease or diminish as the necessity of the case demands.\u201d\nId., at 300. Accordingly, this Court has recognized that\nthe \u201cjurisdiction\u201d of \u201cour common-law war courts\u201d has not\nbeen \u201cprescribed by statute,\u201d but rather \u201chas been adapted\nin each instance to the need that called it forth.\u201d Madsen,\n343 U. S., at 346\u2013348. Second, the common law of war\naffords a measure of respect for the judgment of military\ncommanders. Thus, \u201c[t]he commander of an army in time\nof war has the same power to organize military tribunals\nand execute their judgments that he has to set his squad\nrons in the field and fight battles. His authority in each\ncase is from the law and usage of war.\u201d 11 Op. Atty. Gen.,\nat 305. In recognition of these principles, Congress has\ngenerally \u201c \u2018left it to the President, and the military com\nmanders representing him, to employ the commission, as\noccasion may require, for the investigation and punish\nment of violations of the law of war.\u2019 \u201d Madsen, supra, at\n347, n. 9 (quoting Winthrop 831; emphasis added).\n   In one key respect, the plurality departs from the proper\nframework for evaluating the adequacy of the charge\nagainst Hamdan under the laws of war. The plurality\nholds that where, as here, \u201cneither the elements of the\noffense nor the range of permissible punishments is de\nfined by statute or treaty, the precedent [establishing\nwhether an offense is triable by military commission]\n14                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nmust be plain and unambiguous.\u201d Ante, at 38. This is a\npure contrivance, and a bad one at that. It is contrary to\nthe presumption we acknowledged in Quirin, namely, that\nthe actions of military commissions are \u201cnot to be set aside\nby the courts without the clear conviction that they are\u201d\nunlawful, 317 U. S., at 25 (emphasis added). It is also\ncontrary to Yamashita, which recognized the legitimacy of\nthat military commission notwithstanding a substantial\ndisagreement pertaining to whether Yamashita had been\ncharged with a violation of the law of war. Compare 327\nU. S., at 17 (noting that the allegations were \u201cadequat[e]\u201d\nand \u201cneed not be stated with . . . precision\u201d), with id., at 35\n(Murphy, J., dissenting) (arguing that the charge was\ninadequate). Nor does it find support from the separation\nof powers authority cited by the plurality. Indeed, Madi\nson\u2019s praise of the separation of powers in The Federalist\nNo. 47, quoted ante, at 38-39, if it has any relevance at all,\nmerely highlights the illegitimacy of today\u2019s judicial intru\nsion onto core executive prerogatives in the waging of war,\nwhere executive competence is at its zenith and judicial\ncompetence at its nadir.\n  The plurality\u2019s newly minted clear-statement rule is also\nfundamentally inconsistent with the nature of the common\nlaw which, by definition, evolves and develops over time\nand does not, in all cases, \u201csay what may be done.\u201d 11 Op.\nAtty. Gen., at 300. Similarly, it is inconsistent with the\nnature of warfare, which also evolves and changes over\ntime, and for which a flexible, evolutionary common-law\nsystem is uniquely appropriate.6 Though the charge\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Indeed, respecting the present conflict, the President has found that\n\n\u201cthe war against terrorism ushers in a new paradigm, one in which\ngroups with broad, international reach commit horrific acts against\ninnocent civilians, sometimes with the direct support of states. Our\nNation recognizes that this new paradigm\u2014ushered in not by us, but\nby terrorists\u2014requires new thinking in the law of war.\u201d App. 34\u201335.\nUnder the Court\u2019s approach, the President\u2019s ability to address this \u201cnew\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

We should undertake to deter\nmine whether an unlawful combatant has been charged\nwith an offense against the law of war with an under\nstanding that the common law of war is flexible, respon\nsive to the exigencies of the present conflict, and deferen\ntial to the judgment of military commanders.\n                              1\n   Under either the correct, flexible approach to evaluating\nthe adequacy of Hamdan\u2019s charge, or under the plurality\u2019s\nnew, clear-statement approach, Hamdan has been charged\nwith conduct constituting two distinct violations of the law\nof war cognizable before a military commission: member\nship in a war-criminal enterprise and conspiracy to com\nmit war crimes. The charging section of the indictment\nalleges both that Hamdan \u201cwillfully and knowingly joined\nan enterprise of persons who shared a common criminal\npurpose,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a, and that he \u201cconspired\nand agreed with [al Qaeda] to commit . . . offenses triable\nby military commission,\u201d ibid.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nparadigm\u201d of inflicting death and mayhem would be completely frozen\nby rules developed in the context of conventional warfare.\n  7 It is true that both of these separate offenses are charged under a\n\nsingle heading entitled \u201cCHARGE: CONSPIRACY,\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 65a. But that does not mean that they must be treated as a single\ncrime, when the law of war treats them as separate crimes. As we\nacknowledged in In re Yamashita, 327 U. S. 1 (1946), \u201ccharges of\nviolations of the law of war triable before a military tribunal need not\nbe stated with the precision of a common law indictment.\u201d Id., at 17; cf.\nW. Birkhimer, Military Government and Martial Law 536 (3d ed. 1914)\n(hereinafter Birkhimer) (\u201c[I]t would be extremely absurd to expect the\nsame precision in a charge brought before a court-martial as is required to\nsupport a conviction before a justice of the peace\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n16                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   The common law of war establishes that Hamdan\u2019s\nwillful and knowing membership in al Qaeda is a war\ncrime chargeable before a military commission. Hamdan,\na confirmed enemy combatant and member or affiliate of\nal Qaeda, has been charged with willfully and knowingly\njoining a group (al Qaeda) whose purpose is \u201cto support\nviolent attacks against property and nationals (both mili\ntary and civilian) of the United States.\u201d Id., at 64a; 344 F.\nSupp. 2d, at 161. Moreover, the allegations specify that\nHamdan joined and maintained his relationship with al\nQaeda even though he \u201cbelieved that Usama bin Laden\nand his associates were involved in the attacks on the\nU. S. Embassies in Kenya and Tazania in August 1998,\nthe attack on the USS COLE in October 2000, and the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   Nevertheless, the plurality contends that Hamdan was \u201cnot actually\ncharged,\u201d ante, at 37, n. 32 (emphasis deleted), with being a member in\na war criminal organization. But that position is demonstrably wrong.\nHamdan\u2019s charging document expressly charges that he \u201cwillfully and\nknowingly joined an enterprise of persons who shared a common\ncriminal purpose.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a. Moreover, the plurality\u2019s\ncontention that we may only look to the label affixed to the charge to\ndetermine if the charging document alleges an offense triable by\nmilitary commission is flatly inconsistent with its treatment of the Civil\nWar cases\u2014where it accepts as valid charges that did not appear in the\nheading or title of the charging document, or even the listed charge\nitself, but only in the supporting specification. See, e.g., ante, at 45\u201346\n(discussing the military commission trial of Wirz). For example, in the\nWirz case, Wirz was charged with conspiring to violate the laws of war,\nand that charge was supported with allegations that he personally\ncommitted a number of atrocities. The plurality concludes that military\ncommission jurisdiction was appropriate in that case not based upon\nthe charge of conspiracy, but rather based upon the allegations of\nvarious atrocities in the specification which were not separately\ncharged. Ante, at 45. Just as these atrocities, not separately charged,\nwere independent violations of the law of war supporting Wirz\u2019s trial by\nmilitary commission, so too here Hamdan\u2019s membership in al Qaeda\nand his provision of various forms of assistance to al Qaeda\u2019s top\nleadership are independent violations of the law of war supporting his\ntrial by military commission.\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

These allegations, against a\nconfirmed unlawful combatant, are alone sufficient to\nsustain the jurisdiction of Hamdan\u2019s military commission.\n  For well over a century it has been established that \u201cto\nunite with banditti, jayhawkers, guerillas, or any other\nunauthorized marauders is a high offence against the laws\nof war; the offence is complete when the band is organized\nor joined. The atrocities committed by such a band do not\nconstitute the offence, but make the reasons, and sufficient\nreasons they are, why such banditti are denounced by the\nlaws of war.\u201d 11 Op. Atty. Gen., at 312 (emphasis added).8\nIn other words, unlawful combatants, such as Hamdan,\nviolate the law of war merely by joining an organization,\nsuch as al Qaeda, whose principal purpose is the \u201ckilling\n[and] disabling . . . of peaceable citizens or soldiers.\u201d\nWinthrop 784; see also 11 Op.

This conclu\nsion is unsurprising, as it is a \u201ccardinal principle of the\nlaw of war . . . that the civilian population must enjoy\ncomplete immunity.\u201d 4 International Committee of Red\nCross, Commentary: Geneva Convention Relative to the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 These observations respecting the law of war were made by the\n\nAttorney General in defense of the military commission trial of the\nLincoln conspirators\u2019. As the foregoing quoted portion of that opinion\nmakes clear, the Attorney General did not, as the Court maintains,\n\u201ctrea[t] the charge as if it alleged the substantive offense of assassina\ntion.\u201d Ante, at 40, n. 35. Rather, he explained that the conspirators\n\u201chigh offence against the laws of war\u201d was \u201ccomplete\u201d when their band\nwas \u201corganized or joined,\u201d and did not depend upon \u201catrocities commit\nted by such a band.\u201d 11 Op. Atty. Gen. 297, 312 (1865). Moreover, the\nAttorney General\u2019s conclusions specifically refute the plurality\u2019s unsup\nported suggestion that I have blurred the line between \u201cthose categories\nof \u2018offender\u2019 who may be tried by military commission . . . with the\n\u2018offenses\u2019 that may be so tried.\u201d Ante, at 37, n. 32.\n18                      HAMDAN v.

The plurality attempts to explain\nthese examples away by suggesting that the conspiracies\nlisted by Winthrop are best understood as \u201ca species of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 The plurality concludes that military commission jurisdiction was\n\nappropriate in the case of the Lincoln conspirators because they were\ncharged with \u201c \u2018maliciously, unlawfully, and traitorously murdering the\nsaid Abraham Lincoln,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 40, n. 35. But the sole charge filed in\nthat case alleged conspiracy, and the allegations pertaining to \u201cmali\nciously, unlawfully, and traitorously murdering the said Abraham\nLincoln\u201d were not charged or labeled as separate offenses, but rather as\novert acts \u201cin pursuance of and in prosecuting said malicious, unlawful,\nand traitorous conspiracy. \u201d G. C. M. O. No. 356, at ___ (emphasis\nadded). While the plurality contends the murder of President Lincoln\nwas charged as a distinct separate offense, the foregoing quoted lan\nguage of the charging document unequivocally establishes otherwise.\nMoreover, though I agree that the allegations pertaining to these overt\nacts provided an independent basis for the military commission\u2019s\njurisdiction in that case, that merely confirms the propriety of examin\ning all the acts alleged\u2014whether or not they are labeled as separate\noffenses\u2014to determine if a defendant has been charged with a violation\nof the law of war. As I have already explained, Hamdan has been\ncharged with violating the law of war not only by participating in a\nconspiracy to violate the law of war, but also by joining a war criminal\nenterprise and by supplying provisions and assistance to that enter\nprise\u2019s top leadership.\n24                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncompound offense,\u201d namely, violations both of the law of\nwar and ordinary criminal laws, rather than \u201cstand-alone\noffense[s] against the law of war.\u201d Ante, at 44\u201345 (citing,\nas an example, murder in violation of the laws of war).\nBut the fact that, for example, conspiracy to commit mur\nder can at the same time violate ordinary criminal laws\nand the law of war, so that it is \u201ca combination of the two\nspecies of offenses,\u201d Howland 1071, does not establish that\na military commission would not have jurisdiction to try\nthat crime solely on the basis that it was a violation of the\nlaw of war. Rather, if anything, and consistent with the\nprinciple that the common law of war is flexible and af\nfords some level of deference to the judgments of military\ncommanders, it establishes that military commissions\nwould have the discretion to try the offense as (1) one\nagainst the law of war, or (2) one against the ordinary\ncriminal laws, or (3) both.\n  In any event, the plurality\u2019s effort to avoid the import of\nWinthrop\u2019s footnote through the smokescreen of its \u201ccom\npound offense\u201d theory, ante, at 44\u201345, cannot be reconciled\nwith the particular charges that sustained military com\nmission jurisdiction in the cases that Winthrop cites. For\nexample, in the military commission trial of Henry Wirtz,\nCharge I provided that he had been\n     \u201c[m]aliciously, willfully, and traitorously . . . combin\n     ing, confederating, and conspiring, together [with\n     various other named and unnamed co-conspirators],\n     to injure the health and destroy the lives of soldiers in\n     the military service of the United States, then held\n     and being prisoners of war within the lines of the so-\n     called Confederate States, and in the military prisons\n     thereof, to the end that the armies of the United\n     States might be weakened and impaired, in violation\n     of the laws and customs of war.\u201d G. C. M. O. No. 607\n     (1865), reprinted in H. R. Doc. No. 314, at 785 (em\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

The plurality suggests the Wirz case is not relevant\nbecause the specification supporting his conspiracy charge alleged that\nhe \u201cpersonally committed a number of atrocities.\u201d Ante, at 45. But this\ndoes not establish that conspiracy to violate the laws of war, the very\ncrime with which Wirz was charged, is not itself a violation of the law\nof war. Rather, at best, it establishes that in addition to conspiracy\nWirz violated the laws of war by committing various atrocities, just as\nHamdan violated the laws of war not only by conspiring to do so, but\nalso by joining al Qaeda and providing provisions and services to its top\nleadership. Moreover, the fact that Wirz was charged with overt acts\nthat are more severe than the overt acts with which Hamdan has been\ncharged does not establish that conspiracy is not an offense cognizable\nbefore military commission; rather it merely establishes that Wirz\u2019s\noffenses may have been comparably worse than Hamdan\u2019s offenses.\n   The plurality\u2019s claim that the charge against Lenger Grenfel supports\nits compound offense theory is similarly unsupportable. The plurality\ndoes not, and cannot, dispute that Grenfel was charged with conspiring\nto violate the laws of war by releasing rebel prisoners\u2014a charge that\nbears no relation to a crime \u201cordinarily triable in civilian courts.\u201d Ante,\nat 46, n. 37. Tellingly, the plurality does not reference or discuss this\ncharge, but instead refers to the conclusion of Judge Advocate Holt that\nGrenfel also \u201c \u2018united himself with traitors and malefactors for the\noverthrow of our Republic in the interest of slavery.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting\nH. R. Doc. No. 314, at 689). But Judge Advocate Holt\u2019s observation\nprovides no support for the plurality\u2019s conclusion, as it does not discuss\nthe charges that sustained military commission jurisdiction, much less\nsuggest that such charges were not violations of the law of war.\n26                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsuppression of the existing rebellion, by the burning and\ndestruction of steamboats and means of transportation on\nthe Mississippi river\u201d). These examples provide incontro\nvertible support for the President\u2019s conclusion that the\ncommon law of war permits military commission trials for\nconspiracy to violate the law of war. And they specifically\ncontradict the plurality\u2019s conclusion to the contrary,\nthereby easily satisfying its requirement that the Gov\nernment \u201cmake a substantial showing that the crime for\nwhich it seeks to try a defendant by military commission\nis acknowledged to be an offense against the law of war.\u201d\nAnte, at 39-40.14\n   The plurality further contends, in reliance upon Win\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   14 The plurality contends that international practice\u2014including the\n\npractice of the IMT at Nuremberg\u2014supports its conclusion that con\nspiracy is not an offense triable by military commission because \u201c \u2018[t]he\nAnglo-American concept of conspiracy was not part of European legal\nsystems and arguably not an element of the internationally recognized\nlaws of war.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 47 (quoting T. Taylor, Anatomy of the Nurem\nberg Trials: A Personal Memoir 36 (1992)). But while the IMT did not\ncriminalize all conspiracies to violate the law of war, it did criminalize\n\u201cparticipation in a common plan or conspiracy\u201d to wage aggressive war.\nSee 1 Trials, pp. XI\u2013XII. Moreover, the World War II military tribunals\nof several European nations recognized conspiracy to violate the laws of\nwar as an offense triable before military commissions. See 15 U. N.\nCommission 90\u201391 (noting that the French Military Tribunal at Mar\nseilles found Henri Georges Stadelhofer \u201cguilty of the crime of associa\ntion de malfaiteurs,\u201d namely of \u201chaving formed with various members of\nthe German Gestapo an association with the aim of preparing or\ncommitting crimes against persons or property, without justification\nunder the laws and usages of war\u201d); 11 id., at 98 (noting that the\nNetherlands\u2019 military tribunals were authorized to try conspiracy to\nviolate the laws of war). Thus, the European legal systems\u2019 approach to\ndomestic conspiracy law has not prevented European nations from\nrecognizing conspiracy offenses as violations of the law of war. This is\nunsurprising, as the law of war is derived not from domestic law but\nfrom the wartime practices of civilized nations, including the United\nStates, which has consistently recognized that conspiracy to violate the\nlaws of war is an offense triable by military commission.\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            27\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthrop, that conspiracy is not an offense cognizable before a\nlaw-of-war military commission because \u201cit is not enough\nto intend to violate the law of war and commit overt acts\nin furtherance of that intention unless the overt acts\neither are themselves offenses against the law of war or\nconstitute steps sufficiently substantial to qualify as an\nattempt.\u201d Ibid. But Winthrop does not support the plural\nity\u2019s conclusion. The passage in Winthrop cited by the\nplurality states only that \u201cthe jurisdiction of the military\ncommission should be restricted to cases of offence consist\ning in overt acts, i.e. in unlawful commissions or actual\nattempts to commit, and not in intentions merely.\u201d Win\nthrop 841 (emphasis in original). This passage would be\nhelpful to the plurality if its subject were \u201cconspiracy,\u201d\nrather than the \u201cjurisdiction of the military commission.\u201d\nWinthrop is not speaking here of the requirements for a\nconspiracy charge, but of the requirements for all charges.\nIntentions do not suffice. An unlawful act\u2014such as com\nmitting the crime of conspiracy\u2014is necessary. Winthrop\nsays nothing to exclude either conspiracy or membership\nin a criminal enterprise, both of which go beyond \u201cinten\ntions merely\u201d and \u201cconsis[t] of overt acts, i.e. . . . unlawful\ncommissions or actual attempts to commit,\u201d and both of\nwhich are expressly recognized by Winthrop as crimes\nagainst the law of war triable by military commissions.\nId., at 784; id., at 839, and n. 5, 840. Indeed, the commis\nsion of an \u201covert ac[t]\u201d is the traditional requirement for\nthe completion of the crime of conspiracy, and the charge\nagainst Hamdan alleges numerous such overt acts. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 65a. The plurality\u2019s approach, unsup\nported by Winthrop, requires that any overt act to further\na conspiracy must itself be a completed war crime distinct\nfrom conspiracy\u2014which merely begs the question the\nplurality sets out to answer, namely, whether conspiracy\nitself may constitute a violation of the law of war. And,\neven the plurality\u2019s unsupported standard is satisfied\n28                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nhere. Hamdan has been charged with the overt acts of\nproviding protection, transportation, weapons, and other\nservices to the enemy, id., at 65a\u201367a, acts which in and of\nthemselves are violations of the laws of war. See supra, at\n20\u201321; Winthrop 839\u2013840.\n                               3\n   Ultimately, the plurality\u2019s determination that Hamdan\nhas not been charged with an offense triable before a\nmilitary commission rests not upon any historical example\nor authority, but upon the plurality\u2019s raw judgment of the\n\u201cinability on the Executive\u2019s part here to satisfy the most\nbasic precondition . . . for establishment of military com\nmissions: military necessity.\u201d Ante, at 48. This judgment\nstarkly confirms that the plurality has appointed itself the\nultimate arbiter of what is quintessentially a policy and\nmilitary judgment, namely, the appropriate military\nmeasures to take against those who \u201caided the terrorist\nattacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.\u201d AUMF\n\u00a72(a), 115 Stat. 224. The plurality\u2019s suggestion that Ham\ndan\u2019s commission is illegitimate because it is not dispens\ning swift justice on the battlefield is unsupportable. Ante,\nat 43. Even a cursory review of the authorities confirms\nthat law-of-war military commissions have wide-ranging\njurisdiction to try offenses against the law of war in exi\ngent and nonexigent circumstances alike. See, e.g., Win\nthrop 839\u2013840; see also Yamashita, 327 U. S., at 5 (mili\ntary commission trial after the cessation of hostilities in\nthe Philippines); Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (military commission\ntrial in Washington, D. C.). Traditionally, retributive\njustice for heinous war crimes is as much a \u201cmilitary\nnecessity\u201d as the \u201cdemands\u201d of \u201cmilitary efficiency\u201d touted\nby the plurality, and swift military retribution is precisely\nwhat Congress authorized the President to impose on the\nSeptember 11 attackers in the AUMF.\n   Today a plurality of this Court would hold that conspir\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           29\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nacy to massacre innocent civilians does not violate the\nlaws of war. This determination is unsustainable. The\njudgment of the political branches that Hamdan, and\nothers like him, must be held accountable before military\ncommissions for their involvement with and membership\nin an unlawful organization dedicated to inflicting massive\ncivilian casualties is supported by virtually every relevant\nauthority, including all of the authorities invoked by the\nplurality today. It is also supported by the nature of the\npresent conflict. We are not engaged in a traditional\nbattle with a nation-state, but with a worldwide, hydra-\nheaded enemy, who lurks in the shadows conspiring to\nreproduce the atrocities of September 11, 2001, and who\nhas boasted of sending suicide bombers into civilian gath\nerings, has proudly distributed videotapes of beheadings of\ncivilian workers, and has tortured and dismembered\ncaptured American soldiers. But according to the plural\nity, when our Armed Forces capture those who are plotting\nterrorist atrocities like the bombing of the Khobar Towers,\nthe bombing of the U. S. S. Cole, and the attacks of Sep\ntember 11\u2014even if their plots are advanced to the very\nbrink of fulfillment\u2014our military cannot charge those\ncriminals with any offense against the laws of war. In\nstead, our troops must catch the terrorists \u201credhanded,\u201d\nante, at 48, in the midst of the attack itself, in order to\nbring them to justice. Not only is this conclusion funda\nmentally inconsistent with the cardinal principal of the\nlaw of war, namely protecting non-combatants, but it\nwould sorely hamper the President\u2019s ability to confront\nand defeat a new and deadly enemy.\n   After seeing the plurality overturn longstanding prece\ndents in order to seize jurisdiction over this case, ante, at\n2\u20134 (SCALIA, J., dissenting), and after seeing them disre\ngard the clear prudential counsel that they abstain in\nthese circumstances from using equitable powers, ante, at\n19\u201324, it is no surprise to see them go on to overrule one\n30                HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nafter another of the President\u2019s judgments pertaining to\nthe conduct of an ongoing war. Those Justices who today\ndisregard the commander-in-chief\u2019s wartime decisions,\nonly 10 days ago deferred to the judgment of the Corps of\nEngineers with regard to a matter much more within the\ncompetence of lawyers, upholding that agency\u2019s wildly\nimplausible conclusion that a storm drain is a tributary of\nthe waters of the United States. See Rapanos v. United\nStates, 547 U. S. ___(2006). It goes without saying that\nthere is much more at stake here than storm drains. The\nplurality\u2019s willingness to second-guess the determination\nof the political branches that these conspirators must be\nbrought to justice is both unprecedented and dangerous.\n                             III\n  The Court holds that even if \u201cthe Government has\ncharged Hamdan with an offense against the law of war\ncognizable by military commission, the commission lacks\npower to proceed\u201d because of its failure to comply with the\nterms of the UCMJ and the four Geneva Conventions signed\nin 1949. Ante, at 49. This position is untenable.\n                             A\n   As with the jurisdiction of military commissions, the\nprocedure of such commissions \u201chas [not] been prescribed\nby statute,\u201d but \u201chas been adapted in each instance to the\nneed that called it forth.\u201d Madsen, 343 U. S., at 347\u2013348.\nIndeed, this Court has concluded that \u201c[i]n the absence of\nattempts by Congress to limit the President\u2019s power, it\nappears that, as Commander in Chief of the Army and\nNavy of the United States, he may, in time of war, estab\nlish and prescribe the jurisdiction and procedure of mili\ntary commissions.\u201d Id., at 348. This conclusion is consis\ntent with this Court\u2019s understanding that military\ncommissions are \u201cour common-law war courts.\u201d Id., at\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

This conclusion is not only\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 Though    it does not constitute a basis for any holding of the Court,\nthe Court maintains that, as a \u201cgeneral rule,\u201d \u201cthe procedures govern\ning trials by military commission historically have been the same as\nthose governing courts-martial.\u201d Ante, at 54, 53. While it is undoubt\nedly true that military commissions have invariably employed most of\nthe procedures employed by courts-martial, that is not a requirement.\nSee Winthrop 841 (\u201c[M]ilitary commissions . . . are commonly conducted\naccording to the rules and forms governing courts-martial. These war-\ncourts are indeed more summary in their action than are the courts\nheld under the Articles of war, and . . . their proceedings . . . will not be\nrendered illegal by the omission of details required upon trials by\ncourts-martial\u201d (emphasis in original; footnotes omitted)); 1 U. N.\nCommission 116\u2013117 (\u201cThe [World War II] Mediterranean Regulations\n(No. 8) provide that Military Commissions shall conduct their proceed\nings as may be deemed necessary for full and fair trial, having regard\nfor, but not being bound by, the rules of procedure prescribed for Gen\neral Courts Martial\u201d (emphasis added)); id., at 117 (\u201cIn the [World War\nII] European directive it is stated . . . that Military Commissions shall\nhave power to make, as occasion requires, such rules for the conduct of\ntheir proceedings consistent with the powers of such Commissions, and\nwith the rules of procedure . . . as are deemed necessary for a full and\nfair trial of the accused, having regard for, without being bound by, the\nrules of procedure and evidence prescribed for General Courts Mar\ntial\u201d). Moreover, such a requirement would conflict with the settled\nunderstanding of the flexible and responsive nature of military com\nmissions and the President\u2019s wartime authority to employ such tribu\nnals as he sees fit. See Birkhimer 537\u2013538 (\u201c[M]ilitary commissions may\nso vary their procedure as to adapt it to any situation, and may extend\ntheir powers to any necessary degree. . . . The military commander decides\nupon the character of the military tribunal which is suited to the occasion\n. . . and his decision is final\u201d).\n32                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncontrary to the text and structure of the UCMJ, but it is\nalso inconsistent with precedent of this Court. Consistent\nwith Madsen\u2019s conclusion pertaining to the common-law\nnature of military commissions and the President\u2019s discre\ntion to prescribe their procedures, Article 36 of the UCMJ\nauthorizes the President to establish procedures for mili\ntary commissions \u201cwhich shall, so far as he considers\npracticable, apply the principles of law and the rules of\nevidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases\nin the United States district courts, but which may not be\ncontrary to or inconsistent with this chapter.\u201d 10 U. S. C.\n\u00a7836(a) (emphasis added). Far from constraining the\nPresident\u2019s authority, Article 36 recognizes the President\u2019s\nprerogative to depart from the procedures applicable in\ncriminal cases whenever he alone does not deem such\nprocedures \u201cpracticable.\u201d While the procedural regula\ntions promulgated by the Executive must not be \u201ccontrary\nto\u201d the UCMJ, only a few provisions of the UCMJ mention\n\u201cmilitary commissions,\u201d see ante, at 58, n. 49, and there is\nno suggestion that the procedures to be employed by\nHamdan\u2019s commission implicate any of those provisions.\n   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Court concludes that\nArticle 36(b) of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. \u00a7836(b), which\nprovides that \u201c \u2018[a]ll rules and regulations made under this\narticle shall be uniform insofar as practicable,\u2019 \u201d ante, at\n57, requires the President to employ the same rules and\nprocedures in military commissions as are employed by\ncourts-martial \u201cinsofar as practicable.\u201d Ante, at 59. The\nCourt further concludes that Hamdan\u2019s commission is\nunlawful because the President has not explained why it\nis not practicable to apply the same rules and procedures\nto Hamdan\u2019s commission as would be applied in a trial by\ncourt martial. Ante, at 60.\n   This interpretation of \u00a7836(b) is unconvincing. As an\ninitial matter, the Court fails to account for our cases\ninterpreting the predecessor to Article 21 of the UCMJ\u2014\n                    Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                 33\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nArticle 15 of the Articles of War\u2014which provides crucial\ncontext that bears directly on the proper interpretation of\nArticle 36(b). Article 15 of the Articles of War provided\nthat:\n     \u201cThe provisions of these articles conferring jurisdic\n     tion upon courts-martial shall not be construed as de\n     priving military commissions, provost courts, or other\n     military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction in respect\n     of offenders or offences that by statute or by the law of\n     war may be triable by such military commissions,\n     provost courts, or other military tribunals.\u201d\nIn Yamashita, this Court concluded that Article 15 of the\nArticles of War preserved the President\u2019s unfettered au\nthority to prescribe military commission procedure. The\nCourt explained, \u201c[b]y thus recognizing military commis\nsions in order to preserve their traditional jurisdiction\nover enemy combatants unimpaired by the Articles, Con\ngress gave sanction . . . to any use of the military commis\nsion contemplated by the common law of war.\u201d 327 U. S.,\nat 20 (emphasis added)16; see also Quirin, 317 U. S., at 28;\nMadsen, 343 U. S., at 355. In reaching this conclusion,\nthis Court treated as authoritative the congressional\ntestimony of Judge Advocate General Crowder, who testi\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  16 The Court suggests that Congress\u2019 amendment to Article 2 of the\nUCMJ, providing that the UCMJ applies to \u201cpersons within an area\nleased by or otherwise reserved or acquired for the use of the United\nStates,\u201d 10 U. S. C. \u00a7802(a)(12), deprives Yamashita\u2019s conclusion\nrespecting the President\u2019s authority to promulgate military commission\nprocedures of its \u201cprecedential value.\u201d Ante, at 56. But this merely\nbegs the question of the scope and content of the remaining provisions\nof the UCMJ. Nothing in the additions to Article 2, or any other\nprovision of the UCMJ, suggests that Congress has disturbed this\nCourt\u2019s unequivocal interpretation of Article 21 as preserving the\ncommon-law status of military commissions and the corresponding\nauthority of the President to set their procedures pursuant to his\ncommander-in-chief powers. See Quirin, 317 U. S., at 28; Yamashita,\n327 U. S., at 20; Madsen v. Kinsella, 343 U. S. 341, 355 (1952).\n34                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nfied that Article 15 of the Articles of War was enacted to\npreserve the military commission as \u201c \u2018our common-law\nwar court.\u2019 \u201d Yamashita, supra, at 19, n. 7. And this Court\nrecognized that Article 15\u2019s preservation of military com\nmissions as common-law war courts preserved the Presi\ndent\u2019s commander-in-chief authority to both \u201cestablish\u201d\nmilitary commissions and to \u201cprescribe [their] proce\ndure[s].\u201d Madsen, 343 U. S., at 348; id., at 348\u2013349 (ex\nplaining that Congress had \u201crefrain[ed] from legislating\u201d\nin the area of military commission procedures, in \u201ccon\ntras[t] with its traditional readiness to . . . prescrib[e],\nwith particularity, the jurisdiction and procedure of\nUnited States courts-martial\u201d); cf. Green 834 (\u201cThe mili\ntary commission exercising jurisdiction under common law\nauthority is usually appointed by a superior military\ncommander and is limited in its procedure only by the will\nof that commander. Like any other common law court, in\nthe absence of directive of superior authority to the con\ntrary, the military commission is free to formulate its own\nrules of procedure\u201d).\n   Given these precedents, the Court\u2019s conclusion that\nArticle 36(b) requires the President to apply the same\nrules and procedures to military commissions as are appli\ncable to courts-martial is unsustainable. When Congress\ncodified Article 15 of the Articles of War in Article 21 of\nthe UCMJ it was \u201cpresumed to be aware of . . . and to\nadopt\u201d this Court\u2019s interpretation of that provision as\npreserving the common-law status of military commis\nsions, inclusive of the President\u2019s unfettered authority to\nprescribe their procedures. Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S.\n575, 580 (1978). The Court\u2019s conclusion that Article 36(b)\nrepudiates this settled meaning of Article 21 is not based\nupon a specific textual reference to military commissions,\nbut rather on a one-sentence subsection providing that\n\u201c[a]ll rules and regulations made under this article shall\nbe uniform insofar as practicable.\u201d 10 U.

Moreover, the Court\u2019s conclusion is flatly con\ntrary to its duty not to set aside Hamdan\u2019s commission\n\u201cwithout the clear conviction that [it is] in conflict with the\n. . . laws of Congress constitutionally enacted.\u201d Quirin,\nsupra, at 25 (emphasis added).\n    Nothing in the text of Article 36(b) supports the Court\u2019s\nsweeping conclusion that it represents an unprecedented\ncongressional effort to change the nature of military com\nmissions from common-law war courts to tribunals that\nmust presumptively function like courts-martial. And\nsuch an interpretation would be strange indeed. The\nvision of uniformity that motivated the adoption of the\nUCMJ, embodied specifically in Article 36(b), is nothing\nmore than uniformity across the separate branches of the\narmed services. See ch. 169, 64 Stat. 107 (preamble to the\nUCMJ explaining that the UCMJ is an act \u201c[t]o unify,\nconsolidate, revise, and codify the Articles of War, the\nArticles for the Government of the Navy, and the discipli\nnary laws of the Coast Guard\u201d). There is no indication\nthat the UCMJ was intended to require uniformity in\nprocedure between courts-martial and military commis\nsions, tribunals that the UCMJ itself recognizes are differ\nent. To the contrary, the UCMJ expressly recognizes that\ndifferent tribunals will be constituted in different manners\nand employ different procedures. See 10 U. S. C. \u00a7866\n(providing for three different types of courts-martial\u2014\ngeneral, special, and summary\u2014constituted in different\nmanners and employing different procedures). Thus,\nArticle 36(b) is best understood as establishing that, so far\nas practicable, the rules and regulations governing tribu\nnals convened by the Navy must be uniform with the rules\n36                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nand regulations governing tribunals convened by the\nArmy. But, consistent with this Court\u2019s prior interpreta\ntions of Article 21 and over a century of historical practice,\nit cannot be understood to require the President to con\nform the procedures employed by military commissions to\nthose employed by courts-martial.17\n   Even if Article 36(b) could be construed to require pro\ncedural uniformity among the various tribunals contem\nplated by the UCMJ, Hamdan would not be entitled to\nrelief. Under the Court\u2019s reading, the President is entitled\nto prescribe different rules for military commissions than\nfor courts-martial when he determines that it is not \u201cprac\nticable\u201d to prescribe uniform rules. The Court does not\nresolve the level of deference such determinations would\nbe owed, however, because, in its view, \u201c[t]he President\nhas not . . . [determined] that it is impracticable to apply\nthe rules for courts-martial.\u201d Ante, at 60. This is simply\nnot the case. On the same day that the President issued\nMilitary Commission Order No. 1, the Secretary of De\nfense explained that \u201cthe president decided to establish\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  17 Itbears noting that while the Court does not hesitate to cite legis\nlative history that supports its view of certain statutory provisions, see\nante, at 14\u201315, and n. 10, it makes no citation of the legislative history\npertaining to Article 36(b), which contradicts its interpretation of that\nprovision. Indeed, if it were authoritative, the only legislative history\nrelating to Article 36(b) would confirm the obvious\u2014Article 36(b)\u2019s\nuniformity requirement pertains to uniformity between the three\nbranches of the Armed Forces, and no more. When that subsection was\nintroduced as an amendment to Article 36, its author explained that it\nwould leave the three branches \u201cenough leeway to provide a different\nprovision where it is absolutely necessary\u201d because \u201cthere are some\ndifferences in the services.\u201d Hearings on H. R. 2498 before the Sub\ncommittee No. 1 of the House Committee on Armed Services, 81st\nCong., 1st Sess., 1015 (1949). A further statement explained that\n\u201cthere might be some slight differences that would pertain as to the\nNavy in contrast to the Army, but at least [Article 36(b)] is an expres\nsion of the congressional intent that we want it to be as uniform as\npossible.\u201d Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

The President reached this conclusion because\n    \u201cwe\u2019re in the middle of a war, and . . . had to design a\n    procedure that would allow us to pursue justice for\n    these individuals while at the same time prosecuting\n    the war most effectively. And that means setting\n    rules that would allow us to preserve our intelligence\n    secrets, develop more information about terrorist ac\n    tivities that might be planned for the future so that\n    we can take action to prevent terrorist attacks against\n    the United States. . . . [T]here was a constant balanc\n    ing of the requirements of our war policy and the im\n    portance of providing justice for individuals . . . and\n    each deviation from the standard kinds of rules that\n    we have in our criminal courts was motivated by the\n    desire to strike the balance between individual justice\n    and the broader war policy.\u201d Ibid. (remarks of Doug\n    las J.

Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S.\n103, 111 (1948). And, in the context of the present conflict, it\nis exactly the kind of determination Congress countenanced\nwhen it authorized the President to use all necessary and\nappropriate force against our enemies. Accordingly, the\nPresident\u2019s determination is sufficient to satisfy any practi\ncability requirement imposed by Article 36(b).\n   The plurality further contends that Hamdan\u2019s commis\nsion is unlawful because it fails to provide him the right to\nbe present at his trial, as recognized in 10 U. S. C. A.\n\u00a7839(c) (Supp. 2006). Ante, at 61. But \u00a7839(c) applies to\ncourts-martial, not military commissions. It provides:\n       \u201cWhen the members of a court-martial deliberate or\n     vote, only the members may be present. All other\n     proceedings, including any other consultation of the\n     members of the court with counsel or the military\n     judge, shall be made a part of the record and shall be\n     in the presence of the accused, the defense counsel,\n     the trial counsel, and, in cases in which a military\n     judge has been detailed to the court, the military\n     judge.\u201d\nIn context, \u201call other proceedings\u201d plainly refers exclusively\nto \u201cother proceedings\u201d pertaining to a court-martial.18 This\nis confirmed by the provision\u2019s subsequent reference to\n\u201cmembers of the court\u201d and to \u201ccases in which a military\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  18 In addition to being foreclosed by the text of the provision, the\n\nCourt\u2019s suggestion that 10 U. S. C. A. \u00a7839(c) (Supp. 2006) applies to\nmilitary commissions is untenable because it would require, in military\ncommission proceedings, that the accused be present when the mem\nbers of the commission voted on his guilt or innocence.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

See \u00a7\u00a7839(a)(1)\u2013(4) (\u201c[A]ny time after the service\nof charges which have been referred for trial to a court-\nmartial composed of a military judge and members, the\nmilitary judge may . . . call the court into session without\nthe presence of the members for the purpose of,\u201d hearing\nmotions, issuing rulings, holding arraignments, receiving\npleas, and performing various procedural functions). See\nalso \u00a7839(b) (\u201cProceedings under subsection (a) shall be\nconducted in the presence of the accused\u201d). Section 839(c)\nsimply does not address the procedural requirements of\nmilitary commissions.\n                              B\n   The Court contends that Hamdan\u2019s military commission\nis also unlawful because it violates Common Article 3 of the\nGeneva Conventions, see ante, at 65\u201372. Furthermore,\nHamdan contends that his commission is unlawful because\nit violates various provisions of the Third Geneva Conven\ntion. These contentions are untenable.\n                               1\n   As an initial matter, and as the Court of Appeals con\ncluded, both of Hamdan\u2019s Geneva Convention claims are\nforeclosed by Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763 (1950).\nIn that case the respondents claimed, inter alia, that their\nmilitary commission lacked jurisdiction because it failed to\nprovide them with certain procedural safeguards that they\nargued were required under the Geneva Conventions. Id.,\nat 789\u2013790. While this Court rejected the underlying mer\nits of the respondents\u2019 Geneva Convention claims, id., at\n790, it also held, in the alternative, that the respondents\ncould \u201cnot assert . . . that anything in the Geneva Conven\ntion makes them immune from prosecution or punishment\nfor war crimes,\u201d id., at 789. The Court explained:\n40                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n        \u201cWe are not holding that these prisoners have no\n     right which the military authorities are bound to re\n     spect. The United States, by the Geneva Convention\n     of July 27, 1929, 47 Stat. 2021, concluded with forty-\n     six other countries, including the German Reich, an\n     agreement upon the treatment to be accorded cap\n     tives. These prisoners claim to be and are entitled to\n     its protection. It is, however, the obvious scheme of\n     the Agreement that responsibility for observance and\n     enforcement of these rights is upon political and mili\n     tary authorities. Rights of alien enemies are vindi\n     cated under it only through protests and intervention\n     of protecting powers as the rights of our citizens\n     against foreign governments are vindicated only by\n     Presidential intervention.\u201d Id., at 789, n. 14.\nThis alternative holding is no less binding than if it were\nthe exclusive basis for the Court\u2019s decision. See Massa\nchusetts v. United States, 333 U. S. 611, 623 (1948). While\nthe Court attempts to cast Eisentrager\u2019s unqualified,\nalternative holding as footnote dictum, ante, at 63\u201364, it\ndoes not dispute the correctness of its conclusion, namely,\nthat the provisions of the 1929 Geneva Convention were\nnot judicially enforceable because that Convention con\ntemplated that diplomatic measures by political and mili\ntary authorities were the exclusive mechanisms for such\nenforcement. Nor does the Court suggest that the 1949\nGeneva Conventions departed from this framework. See\nante, at 64 (\u201cWe may assume that \u2018the obvious scheme\u2019 of\nthe 1949 Conventions is identical in all relevant respects\nto that of the 1929 Convention\u201d).\n  Instead, the Court concludes that petitioner may seek\njudicial enforcement of the provisions of the Geneva Con\nventions because \u201cthey are . . . part of the law of war. And\ncompliance with the law of war is the condition upon\nwhich the authority set forth in Article 21 is granted.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          41\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nAnte, at 65 (citation omitted). But Article 21 authorizes\nthe use of military commissions; it does not purport to\nrender judicially enforceable aspects of the law of war that\nare not so enforceable of their own accord. See Quirin, 317\nU. S., at 28 (by enacting Article 21, \u201cCongress has explic\nitly provided, so far as it may constitutionally do so, that\nmilitary tribunals shall have jurisdiction to try offenders\nor offenses against the law of war\u201d). The Court cannot\nescape Eisentrager\u2019s holding merely by observing that\nArticle 21 mentions the law of war; indeed, though Eisen\ntrager did not specifically consider the Court\u2019s novel inter\npretation of Article 21, Eisentrager involved a challenge to\nthe legality of a World War II military commission, which,\nlike all such commissions, found its authorization in Arti\ncle 15 of the Articles of War, the predecessor to Article 21\nof the UCMJ. Thus, the Court\u2019s interpretation of Article\n21 is foreclosed by Eisentrager.\n   In any event, the Court\u2019s argument is too clever by half.\nThe judicial nonenforceability of the Geneva Conventions\nderives from the fact that those Conventions have exclu\nsive enforcement mechanisms, see Eisentrager, supra, at\n789, n. 14, and this, too, is part of the law of war. The\nCourt\u2019s position thus rests on the assumption that Article\n21\u2019s reference to the \u201claws of war\u201d selectively incorporates\nonly those aspects of the Geneva Conventions that the\nCourt finds convenient, namely, the substantive require\nments of Common Article 3, and not those aspects of the\nConventions that the Court, for whatever reason, disfavors,\nnamely the Conventions\u2019 exclusive diplomatic enforcement\nscheme. The Court provides no account of why the partial\nincorporation of the Geneva Conventions should extend\nonly so far\u2014and no further\u2014because none is available\nbeyond its evident preference to adjudicate those matters\nthat the law of war, through the Geneva Conventions,\nconsigns exclusively to the political branches.\n   Even if the Court were correct that Article 21 of the\n42                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nUCMJ renders judicially enforceable aspects of the law of\nwar that are not so enforceable by their own terms, Article\n21 simply cannot be interpreted to render judicially en\nforceable the particular provision of the law of war at issue\nhere, namely Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conven\ntions. As relevant, Article 21 provides that \u201c[t]he provi\nsions of this chapter conferring jurisdiction upon courts-\nmartial do not deprive military commissions . . . of concur\nrent jurisdiction with respect to offenders or offenses that\nby statute or by the law of war may be tried by military\ncommissions.\u201d 10 U. S. C. \u00a7821 (emphasis added). Thus,\nto the extent Article 21 can be interpreted as authorizing\njudicial enforcement of aspects of the law of war that are\nnot otherwise judicially enforceable, that authorization\nonly extends to provisions of the law of war that relate to\nwhether a particular \u201coffender\u201d or a particular \u201coffense\u201d is\ntriable by military commission. Common Article 3 of the\nGeneva Conventions, the sole provision of the Geneva\nConventions relevant to the Court\u2019s holding, relates to\nneither. Rather, it relates exclusively to the particulars of\nthe tribunal itself, namely, whether it is \u201cregularly consti\ntuted\u201d and whether it \u201cafford[s] all the judicial guarantees\nwhich are recognized as indispensable by civilized peo\nples.\u201d Third Geneva Convention, Art. 3, \u00b61(d), Relative to\nthe Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6\nU.

S No. 3364.\n                               2\n   In addition to being foreclosed by Eisentrager, Hamdan\u2019s\nclaim under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions\nis meritless.

Under this Court\u2019s\nprecedents, \u201cthe meaning attributed to treaty provisions\nby the Government agencies charged with their negotia\ntion and enforcement is entitled to great weight.\u201d Sumi\ntomo Shoji America, Inc. v. Avagliano, 457 U. S. 176, 184\u2013\n185 (1982); United States v. Stuart, 489 U. S. 353, 369\n(1989). Our duty to defer to the President\u2019s understanding\nof the provision at issue here is only heightened by the fact\nthat he is acting pursuant to his constitutional authority as\nCommander in Chief and by the fact that the subject matter\nof Common Article 3 calls for a judgment about the nature\nand character of an armed conflict. See generally United\nStates v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 320\n(1936).\n    The President\u2019s interpretation of Common Article 3 is\nreasonable and should be sustained. The conflict with al\nQaeda is international in character in the sense that it is\noccurring in various nations around the globe. Thus, it is\nalso \u201coccurring in the territory of\u201d more than \u201cone of the\nHigh Contracting Parties.\u201d The Court does not dispute the\nPresident\u2019s judgments respecting the nature of our conflict\nwith al Qaeda, nor does it suggest that the President\u2019s\ninterpretation of Common Article 3 is implausible or\nforeclosed by the text of the treaty. Indeed, the Court\nconcedes that Common Article 3 is principally concerned\nwith \u201cfurnish[ing] minimal protection to rebels involved in\n. . . a civil war,\u201d ante, at 68, precisely the type of conflict\nthe President\u2019s interpretation envisions to be subject to\nCommon Article 3. Instead, the Court, without acknowl\nedging its duty to defer to the President, adopts its own,\nadmittedly plausible, reading of Common Article 3. But\nwhere, as here, an ambiguous treaty provision (\u201cnot of an\n44                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ninternational character\u201d) is susceptible of two plausible,\nand reasonable, interpretations, our precedents require us\nto defer to the Executive\u2019s interpretation.\n                                3\n   But even if Common Article 3 were judicially enforce\nable and applicable to the present conflict, petitioner\nwould not be entitled to relief. As an initial matter, any\nclaim petitioner has under Common Article 3 is not ripe.\nThe only relevant \u201cacts\u201d that \u201care and shall remain prohib\nited\u201d under Common Article 3 are \u201cthe passing of sen\ntences and the carrying out of executions without previous\njudgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court\naffording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized\nas indispensable by civilized peoples.\u201d Art. 3, \u00b61(d), 6\nU. S. T., at 1318, 1320 (emphases added). As its terms\nmake clear, Common Article 3 is only violated, as relevant\nhere, by the act of \u201cpassing of sentenc[e],\u201d and thus Ham\ndan will only have a claim if his military commission\nconvicts him and imposes a sentence. Accordingly, as\nHamdan\u2019s claim is \u201ccontingent [upon] future events that\nmay not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at\nall,\u201d it is not ripe for adjudication. Texas v. United States,\n523 U. S. 296, 300 (1998) (internal quotation marks omit\nted).19 Indeed, even if we assume he will be convicted and\nsentenced, whether his trial will be conducted in a manner\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  19 The Court does not dispute the conclusion that Common Article 3\ncannot be violated unless and until Hamdan is convicted and sen\ntenced. Instead, it contends that \u201cthe Geneva Conventions d[o] not\ndirect an accused to wait until sentence is imposed to challenge the\nlegality of the tribunal that is to try him.\u201d Ante, at 62, n. 55. But the\nGeneva Contentions do not direct defendants to enforce their rights\nthrough litigation, but through the Conventions\u2019 exclusive diplomatic\nenforcement provisions.

It is plainly\n\u201cregularly constituted\u201d because such commissions have\nbeen employed throughout our history to try unlawful\ncombatants for crimes against the law of war. This Court\nhas recounted that history as follows:\n    \u201c \u2018By a practice dating from 1847 and renewed and\n    firmly established during the Civil War, military\n    commissions have become adopted as authorized tri\n    bunals in this country in time of war. . . . Their com\n    petency has been recognized not only in acts of Con\n    gress, but in executive proclamations, in rulings of the\n    courts, and in the opinions of the Attorneys General.\u2019 \u201d\n    Madsen, 343 U. S., at 346, n. 8.\nHamdan\u2019s commission has been constituted in accordance\nwith these historical precedents. As I have previously\nexplained, the procedures to be employed by that commis\nsion, and the Executive\u2019s authority to alter those proce\ndures, are consistent with the practice of previous Ameri\ncan military commissions. See supra, at 30\u201334 , and n. 15.\n   The Court concludes Hamdan\u2019s commission fails to\nsatisfy the requirements of Common Article 3 not because\nit differs from the practice of previous military commis\nsions but because it \u201cdeviate[s] from [the procedures]\ngoverning courts-martial.\u201d Ante, at 71.

A military commission is a different tri\nbunal, serving a different function, and thus operates\npursuant to different procedures.

According to the Government, \u201c[b]ecause al Qaeda\noperates as a clandestine force relying on sleeper agents to\nmount surprise attacks, one of the most critical fronts in the\ncurrent war involves gathering intelligence about future\nterrorist attacks and how the terrorist network operates\u2014\nidentifying where its operatives are, how it plans attacks,\nwho directs operations, and how they communicate.\u201d Brief\nfor United States in No. 03\u20134792, United States v.

On\nthe merits, I join JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019 dissent with the excep\ntion of Parts I, II\u2013C\u20131, and III\u2013B\u20132, which concern mat\nters that I find unnecessary to reach. I add the following\ncomments to provide a further explanation of my reasons\nfor disagreeing with the holding of the Court.\n                              I\n   The holding of the Court, as I understand it, rests on the\nfollowing reasoning. A military commission is lawful only\nif it is authorized by 10 U. S. C. \u00a7821; this provision per\nmits the use of a commission to try \u201coffenders or offenses\u201d\nthat \u201cby statute or by the law of war may be tried by\u201d such\na commission; because no statute provides that an of\nfender such as petitioner or an offense such as the one\nwith which he is charged may be tried by a military com\nmission, he may be tried by military commission only if\nthe trial is authorized by \u201cthe law of war\u201d; the Geneva\nConventions are part of the law of war; and Common\nArticle 3 of the Conventions prohibits petitioner\u2019s trial\nbecause the commission before which he would be tried is\nnot \u201ca regularly constituted court,\u201d Third Geneva Conven\n2                  HAMDAN v.

No. 3364. I disagree with this holding because\npetitioner\u2019s commission is \u201ca regularly constituted court.\u201d\n   Common Article 3 provides as follows:\n    \u201cIn the case of armed conflict not of an international\n    character occurring in the territory of one of the High\n    Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict shall\n    be bound to apply, as a minimum, the following\n    provisions:\n      \u201c(1) . . . [T]he following acts are and shall remain\n    prohibited . . . :\n      \u201c(d) [T]he passing of sentences and the carrying out\n    of executions without previous judgment pronounced\n    by a regularly constituted court affording all the judi\n    cial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable\n    by civilized peoples.\u201d Id., at 3318\u20133320 (emphasis\n    added).\n  Common Article 3 thus imposes three requirements.\nSentences may be imposed only by (1) a \u201ccourt\u201d (2) that is\n\u201cregularly constituted\u201d and (3) that affords \u201call the judicial\nguarantees which are recognized as indispensable by\ncivilized peoples.\u201d Id., at 3320.\n  I see no need here to comment extensively on the mean\ning of the first and third requirements. The first require\nment is largely self-explanatory, and, with respect to the\nthird, I note only that on its face it imposes a uniform\ninternational standard that does not vary from signatory\nto signatory.\n  The second element (\u201cregularly constituted\u201d) is the one\non which the Court relies, and I interpret this element to\nrequire that the court be appointed or established in ac\ncordance with the appointing country\u2019s domestic law. I\nagree with the Court, see ante, at 69, n. 64, that, as used\nin Common Article 3, the term \u201cregularly\u201d is synonymous\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            3\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwith \u201cproperly.\u201d The term \u201cconstitute\u201d means \u201cappoint,\u201d\n\u201cset up,\u201d or \u201cestablish,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International\nDictionary 486 (1961), and therefore \u201cregularly consti\ntuted\u201d means properly appointed, set up, or established.\nOur cases repeatedly use the phrases \u201cregularly consti\ntuted\u201d and \u201cproperly constituted\u201d in this sense. See, e.g.,\nHamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 538 (2004) (plurality\nopinion of O\u2019Connor, J.); Nguyen v. United States, 539 U. S.\n69, 83 (2003); Ryder v. United States, 515 U. S. 177, 187\n(1995); Williams v. Bruffy, 96 U. S. 176, 185 (1878).\n   In order to determine whether a court has been properly\nappointed, set up, or established, it is necessary to refer to\na body of law that governs such matters. I interpret\nCommon Article 3 as looking to the domestic law of the\nappointing country because I am not aware of any interna\ntional law standard regarding the way in which such a\ncourt must be appointed, set up, or established, and be\ncause different countries with different government struc\ntures handle this matter differently. Accordingly, \u201ca\nregularly constituted court\u201d is a court that has been ap\npointed, set up, or established in accordance with the\ndomestic law of the appointing country.\n                             II\n  In contrast to this interpretation, the opinions support\ning the judgment today hold that the military commission\nbefore which petitioner would be tried is not \u201ca regularly\nconstituted court\u201d (a) because \u201cno evident practical need\nexplains\u201d why its \u201cstructure and composition . . . deviate\nfrom conventional court-martial standards,\u201d ante, at 11\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring in part); see also ante, at 69\u201370\n(Opinion of the Court); and (b) because, contrary to 10\nU. S. C. \u00a7836(b), the procedures specified for use in the\nproceeding before the military commission impermissibly\ndiffer from those provided under the Uniform Code of\nMilitary Justice (UCMJ) for use by courts-martial, ante, at\n4                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n52\u201362 (Opinion of the Court); ante, at 16\u201318 (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring in part). I do not believe that either of these\ngrounds is sound.\n                               A\n   I see no basis for the Court\u2019s holding that a military\ncommission cannot be regarded as \u201ca regularly constituted\ncourt\u201d unless it is similar in structure and composition to a\nregular military court or unless there is an \u201cevident prac\ntical need\u201d for the divergence. There is no reason why a\ncourt that differs in structure or composition from an\nordinary military court must be viewed as having been\nimproperly constituted. Tribunals that vary significantly\nin structure, composition, and procedures may all be\n\u201cregularly\u201d or \u201cproperly\u201d constituted. Consider, for exam\nple, a municipal court, a state trial court of general juris\ndiction, an Article I federal trial court, a federal district\ncourt, and an international court, such as the Interna\ntional Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.\nAlthough these courts are \u201cdifferently constituted\u201d and\ndiffer substantially in many other respects, they are all\n\u201cregularly constituted.\u201d\n   If Common Article 3 had been meant to require trial\nbefore a country\u2019s military courts or courts that are simi\nlar in structure and composition, the drafters almost\ncertainly would have used language that expresses that\nthought more directly. Other provisions of the Convention\nRelative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War refer ex\npressly to the ordinary military courts and expressly\nprescribe the \u201cuniformity principle\u201d that JUSTICE\nKENNEDY sees in Common Article 3, see ante, at 8\u20139.\nArticle 84 provides that \u201c[a] prisoner of war shall be tried\nonly by a military court, unless the existing laws of the\nDetaining Power expressly permit the civil courts to try a\nmember of the armed forces of the Detaining Power in\nrespect of the particular offence alleged to have been\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

T., at 3382.\nArticle 87 states that \u201c[p]risoners of war may not be sen\ntenced by the military authorities and courts of the De\ntaining Power to any penalties except those provided for in\nrespect of members of the armed forces of the said Power\nwho have committed the same acts.\u201d Id., at 3384. Simi\nlarly, Article 66 of the Geneva Convention Relative to the\nTreatment of Civilian Persons in Time of War\u2014a provi\nsion to which the Court looks for guidance in interpreting\nCommon Article 3, see ante at 69\u2014expressly provides that\ncivilians charged with committing crimes in occupied\nterritory may be handed over by the occupying power \u201cto\nits properly constituted, non-political military courts, on\ncondition that the said courts sit in the occupied country.\u201d\n6 U. S. T. 3516, 3558\u20133560, T. I. A. S. No. 3365. If Com\nmon Article 3 had been meant to incorporate a \u201cuniformity\nprinciple,\u201d it presumably would have used language like\nthat employed in the provisions noted above. For these\nreasons, I cannot agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that\nthe military commission at issue here is not a \u201cregularly\nconstituted court\u201d because its structure and composition\ndiffer from those of a court-martial.\n   Contrary to the suggestion of the Court, see ante, at 69,\nthe commentary on Article 66 of Fourth Geneva Conven\ntion does not undermine this conclusion. As noted, Article\n66 permits an occupying power to try civilians in its \u201cprop\nerly constituted, non-political military courts,\u201d 6 U. S. T.,\nat 3558. The commentary on this provision states:\n    \u201cThe courts are to be \u2018regularly constituted\u2019. This\n    wording definitely excludes all special tribunals. It is\n    the ordinary military courts of the Occupying Power\n    which will be competent.\u201d 4 Int\u2019l Comm. of Red Cross,\n    Commentary: Geneva Convention Relative to the Pro\n    tection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 340 (1958)\n    (hereinafter GCIV Commentary).\n6                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court states that this commentary \u201cdefines \u2018 \u201cregu\nlarly constituted\u201d \u2019 tribunals to include \u2018ordinary military\ncourts\u2019 and \u2018definitely exclud[e] all special tribunals.\u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 69 (alteration in original). This much is clear\nfrom the commentary itself. Yet the mere statement that\na military court is a regularly constituted tribunal is of no\nhelp in addressing petitioner\u2019s claim that his commission\nis not such a tribunal. As for the commentary\u2019s mention of\n\u201cspecial tribunals,\u201d it is doubtful whether we should take\nthis gloss on Article 66\u2014which forbids an occupying power\nfrom trying civilians in courts set up specially for that\npurpose\u2014to tell us much about the very different context\naddressed by Common Article 3.\n   But even if Common Article 3 recognizes this prohibi\ntion on \u201cspecial tribunals,\u201d that prohibition does not cover\npetitioner\u2019s tribunal. If \u201cspecial\u201d means anything in con\ntradistinction to \u201cregular,\u201d it would be in the sense of\n\u201cspecial\u201d as \u201crelating to a single thing,\u201d and \u201cregular\u201d as\n\u201cuniform in course, practice, or occurrence.\u201d Webster\u2019s\nThird New International Dictionary 2186, 1913. Insofar\nas respondents propose to conduct the tribunals according\nto the procedures of Military Commission Order No. 1 and\norders promulgated thereunder\u2014and nobody has sug\ngested respondents intend otherwise\u2014then it seems that\npetitioner\u2019s tribunal, like the hundreds of others respon\ndents propose to conduct, is very much regular and not at\nall special.\n                            B\n   I also disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that peti\ntioner\u2019s military commission is \u201cillegal,\u201d ante, at 62, be\ncause its procedures allegedly do not comply with 10\nU.

S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsumed for the sake of argument that some of the proce\ndures specified in Military Commission Order No. 1\nimpermissibly deviate from court-martial procedures, it\ndoes not follow that the military commissions created by\nthat order are not \u201cregularly constituted\u201d or that trying\npetitioner before such a commission would be inconsistent\nwith the law of war. If Congress enacted a statute requir\ning the federal district courts to follow a procedure that is\nunconstitutional, the statute would be invalid, but the\ndistrict courts would not. Likewise, if some of the proce\ndures that may be used in military commission proceed\nings are improper, the appropriate remedy is to proscribe\nthe use of those particular procedures, not to outlaw the\ncommissions. I see no justification for striking down the\nentire commission structure simply because it is possible\nthat petitioner\u2019s trial might involve the use of some proce\ndure that is improper.\n                               III\n  Returning to the three elements of Common Article 3\u2014\n(1) a court, (2) that is appointed, set up, and established in\ncompliance with domestic law, and (3) that respects uni\nversally recognized fundamental rights\u2014I conclude that\nall of these elements are satisfied in this case.\n                            A\n  First, the commissions qualify as courts.\n  Second, the commissions were appointed, set up, and\nestablished pursuant to an order of the President, just like\nthe commission in Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942), and\nthe Court acknowledges that Quirin recognized that the\nstatutory predecessor of 10 U. S. C. \u00a7821 \u201cpreserved\u201d the\nPresident\u2019s power \u201cto convene military commissions,\u201d ante,\nat 29. Although JUSTICE KENNEDY concludes that \u201can\nacceptable degree of independence from the Executive is\nnecessary to render a commission \u2018regularly constituted\u2019\n8                      HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nby the standards of our Nation\u2019s system of justice,\u201d ante at\n9\u201310, he offers no support for this proposition (which in\nany event seems to be more about fairness or integrity\nthan regularity). The commission in Quirin was certainly\nno more independent from the Executive than the com\nmissions at issue here, and 10 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7821 and 836 do\nnot speak to this issue.1\n   Finally, the commission procedures, taken as a whole,\nand including the availability of review by a United States\nCourt of Appeals and by this Court, do not provide a basis\nfor deeming the commissions to be illegitimate. The Court\nquestions the following two procedural rules: the rule\nallowing the Secretary of Defense to change the governing\nrules \u201c \u2018from time to time\u2019 \u201d (which does not rule out mid-\ntrial changes), see ante, at 70, n. 65 (Opinion of the Court);\nante, at 9\u201310 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part), and the\nrule that permits the admission of any evidence that\nwould have \u201c \u2018probative value to a reasonable person\u2019 \u201d\n(which departs from our legal system\u2019s usual rules of\nevidence), see ante, at 51, 60 (Opinion of the Court); ante,\nat 16\u201318 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part).2 Neither\nof these two rules undermines the legitimacy of the\ncommissions.\n   Surely the entire commission structure cannot be\nstricken merely because it is possible that the governing\nrules might be changed during the course of one or more\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Section821 looks to the \u201claw of war,\u201d not separation of powers is\nsues. And \u00a7836, as JUSTICE KENNEDY notes, concerns procedures, not\nstructure, see ante, at 10.\n  2 The plurality, but not JUSTICE KENNEDY, suggests that the commis\n\nsion rules are improper insofar as they allow a defendant to be denied\naccess to evidence under some circumstances. See, ante, at 70\u201372. But\nhere too, if this procedure is used in a particular case and the accused is\nconvicted, the validity of this procedure can be challenged in the review\nproceeding in that case. In that context, both the asserted need for the\nprocedure and its impact on the accused can be analyzed in concrete\nterms.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           9\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nproceedings. If a change is made and applied during the\ncourse of an ongoing proceeding and if the accused is\nfound guilty, the validity of that procedure can be consid\nered in the review proceeding for that case. After all, not\nevery midtrial change will be prejudicial. A midtrial\nchange might amend the governing rules in a way that is\ninconsequential or actually favorable to the accused.\n  As for the standard for the admission of evidence at\ncommission proceedings, the Court does not suggest that\nthis rule violates the international standard incorporated\ninto Common Article 3 (\u201cthe judicial guarantees which are\nrecognized as indispensable by civilized peoples,\u201d 6\nU. S. T., at 3320). Rules of evidence differ from country to\ncountry, and much of the world does not follow aspects of\nour evidence rules, such as the general prohibition against\nthe admission of hearsay. See, e.g., Blumenthal, Shedding\nSome Light on Calls for Hearsay Reform: Civil Law Hear\nsay Rules in Historical and Modern Perspective, 13 Pace\nInt\u2019l L. Rev. 93, 96\u2013101 (2001). If a particular accused\nclaims to have been unfairly prejudiced by the admission\nof particular evidence, that claim can be reviewed in the\nreview proceeding for that case. It makes no sense to\nstrike down the entire commission structure based on\nspeculation that some evidence might be improperly ad\nmitted in some future case.\n  In sum, I believe that Common Article 3 is satisfied here\nbecause the military commissions (1) qualify as courts, (2)\nthat were appointed and established in accordance with\ndomestic law, and (3) any procedural improprieties that\nmight occur in particular cases can be reviewed in those\ncases.\n                               B\n  The commentary on Common Article 3 supports this\ninterpretation. The commentary on Common Article 3,\n\u00b61(d), in its entirety states:\n10                    HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n       \u201c[A]lthough [sentences and executions without a\n       proper trial] were common practice until quite re\n       cently, they are nevertheless shocking to the civilized\n       mind. . . . Sentences and executions without previous\n       trial are too open to error. \u2018Summary justice\u2019 may be\n       effective on account of the fear it arouses . . . , but it\n       adds too many further innocent victims to all the\n       other innocent victims of the conflict. All civilized na\n       tions surround the administration of justice with safe\n       guards aimed at eliminating the possibility of judicial\n       errors. The Convention has rightly proclaimed that it\n       is essential to do this even in time of war. We must be\n       very clear about one point: it is only \u2018summary\u2019 justice\n       which it is intended to prohibit. No sort of immunity\n       is given to anyone under this provision. There is\n       nothing in it to prevent a person presumed to be\n       guilty from being arrested and so placed in a position\n       where he can do no further harm; and it leaves intact\n       the right of the State to prosecute, sentence and pun\n       ish according to the law.\u201d GCIV Commentary 39 (em\n       phasis added).\n  It seems clear that the commissions at issue here meet\nthis standard. Whatever else may be said about the sys\ntem that was created by Military Commission Order No. 1\nand augmented by the Detainee Treatment Act,\n\u00a71005(e)(1), 119 Stat. 2742, this system\u2014which features\nformal trial procedures, multiple levels of administrative\nreview, and the opportunity for review by a United States\nCourt of Appeals and by this Court\u2014does not dispense\n\u201csummary justice.\u201d\n                           *    *     * \n\n     For these reasons, I respectfully dissent. \n\n",

Argued March 28, 2006\u2014Decided June 29, 2006\nPursuant to Congress\u2019 Joint Resolution authorizing the President to\n  \u201cuse all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, or\n  ganizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, commit\n  ted or aided\u201d the September 11, 2001, al Qaeda terrorist attacks\n  (AUMF), U. S. Armed Forces invaded Afghanistan. During the hos\n  tilities, in 2001, militia forces captured petitioner Hamdan, a Yemeni\n  national, and turned him over to the U. S. military, which, in 2002,\n  transported him to prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Over a year\n  later, the President deemed Hamdan eligible for trial by military\n  commission for then-unspecified crimes. After another year, he was\n  charged with conspiracy \u201cto commit . . . offenses triable by military\n  commission.\u201d In habeas and mandamus petitions, Hamdan asserted\n  that the military commission lacks authority to try him because (1)\n  neither congressional Act nor the common law of war supports trial\n  by this commission for conspiracy, an offense that, Hamdan says, is\n  not a violation of the law of war; and (2) the procedures adopted to\n  try him violate basic tenets of military and international law, includ\n  ing the principle that a defendant must be permitted to see and hear\n  the evidence against him.\n     The District Court granted habeas relief and stayed the commis\n  sion\u2019s proceedings, concluding that the President\u2019s authority to estab\n  lish military commissions extends only to offenders or offenses triable\n  by such a commission under the law of war; that such law includes\n  the Third Geneva Convention; that Hamdan is entitled to that Con\n  vention\u2019s full protections until adjudged, under it, not to be a prisoner\n  of war; and that, whether or not Hamdan is properly classified a pris\n  oner of war, the commission convened to try him was established in\n2                        HAMDAN v.

C. \u00a7801 et seq., and Common Article 3 of the Third Geneva Con\n    vention because it had the power to convict based on evidence the ac\n    cused would never see or hear. The D. C. Circuit reversed. Although\n    it declined the Government\u2019s invitation to abstain from considering\n    Hamdan\u2019s challenge, cf. Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 U. S. 738, the\n    appeals court ruled, on the merits, that Hamdan was not entitled to re\n    lief because the Geneva Conventions are not judicially enforceable. The\n    court also concluded that Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1, foreclosed any\n    separation-of-powers objection to the military commission\u2019s jurisdiction,\n    and that Hamdan\u2019s trial before the commission would violate neither\n    the UCMJ nor Armed Forces regulations implementing the Geneva\n    Conventions.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n415 F. 3d 33, reversed and remanded.\n     JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to\n  Parts V and VI\u2013D\u2013iv, concluding:\n     1. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss, based on the Detainee\n  Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), is denied. DTA \u00a71005(e)(1) provides\n  that \u201cno court . . . shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider . . . an\n  application for . . . habeas corpus filed by . . . an alien detained . . . at\n  Guantanamo Bay.\u201d Section 1005(h)(2) provides that \u00a7\u00a71005(e)(2) and\n  (3)\u2014which give the D. C. Circuit \u201cexclusive\u201d jurisdiction to review the\n  final decisions of, respectively, combatant status review tribunals\n  and military commissions\u2014\u201cshall apply with respect to any claim\n  whose review is . . . pending on\u201d the DTA\u2019s effective date, as was\n  Hamdan\u2019s case. The Government\u2019s argument that \u00a7\u00a71005(e)(1) and\n  (h) repeal this Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the decision below is re\n  butted by ordinary principles of statutory construction. A negative\n  inference may be drawn from Congress\u2019 failure to include \u00a71005(e)(1)\n  within the scope of \u00a71005(h)(2). Cf., e.g., Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S.\n  320, 330. \u201cIf . . . Congress was reasonably concerned to ensure that\n  [\u00a7\u00a71005(e)(2) and (3)] be applied to pending cases, it should have been\n  just as concerned about [\u00a71005(e)(1)], unless it had the different in\n  tent that the latter [section] not be applied to the general run of\n  pending cases.\u201d Id., at 329. If anything, the evidence of deliberate\n  omission is stronger here than it was in Lindh. The legislative his\n  tory shows that Congress not only considered the respective temporal\n  reaches of \u00a7\u00a71005(e)(1), (2), and (3) together at every stage, but omit\n  ted paragraph (1) from its directive only after having rejected earlier\n  proposed versions of the statute that would have included what is\n  now paragraph (1) within that directive\u2019s scope. Congress\u2019 rejection\n  of the very language that would have achieved the result the Gov\n  ernment urges weighs heavily against the Government\u2019s interpreta\n                   Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ntion. See Doe v. Chao, 540 U. S. 614, 621\u2013623. Pp. 7\u201320.\n   2. The Government argues unpersuasively that abstention is ap\npropriate under Councilman, which concluded that, as a matter of\ncomity, federal courts should normally abstain from intervening in\npending courts-martial against service members, see 420 U. S., at\n740. Neither of the comity considerations Councilman identified\nweighs in favor of abstention here. First, the assertion that military\ndiscipline and, therefore, the Armed Forces\u2019 efficient operation, are\nbest served if the military justice system acts without regular inter\nference from civilian courts, see id., at 752, is inapt because Hamdan\nis not a service member. Second, the view that federal courts should\nrespect the balance Congress struck when it created \u201can integrated\nsystem of military courts and review procedures\u201d is inapposite, since\nthe tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of that integrated\nsystem. Rather than Councilman, the most relevant precedent is Ex\nparte Quirin, where the Court, far from abstaining pending the con\nclusion of ongoing military proceedings, expedited its review because\nof (1) the public importance of the questions raised, (2) the Court\u2019s\nduty, in both peace and war, to preserve the constitutional safe\nguards of civil liberty, and (3) the public interest in a decision on\nthose questions without delay, 317 U. S, at 19. The Government has\nidentified no countervailing interest that would permit federal courts\nto depart from their general duty to exercise the jurisdiction Con\ngress has conferred on them. Pp. 20\u201325.\n   3. The military commission at issue is not expressly authorized by\nany congressional Act. Quirin held that Congress had, through Arti\ncle of War 15, sanctioned the use of military commissions to try of\nfenders or offenses against the law of war. 317 U. S., at 28. UCMJ\nArt. 21, which is substantially identical to the old Art. 15, reads: \u201cThe\njurisdiction [of] courts-martial shall not be construed as depriving\nmilitary commissions . . . of concurrent jurisdiction in respect of of\nfenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried\nby such . . . commissions.\u201d 10 U. S. C. \u00a7821. Contrary to the Gov\nernment\u2019s assertion, even Quirin did not view that authorization as a\nsweeping mandate for the President to invoke military commissions\nwhenever he deems them necessary. Rather, Quirin recognized that\nCongress had simply preserved what power, under the Constitution\nand the common law of war, the President already had to convene\nmilitary commissions\u2014with the express condition that he and those\nunder his command comply with the law of war. See 317 U. S., at\n28\u201329. Neither the AUMF nor the DTA can be read to provide spe\ncific, overriding authorization for the commission convened to try\nHamdan. Assuming the AUMF activated the President\u2019s war powers,\nsee Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, and that those powers include\n4                         HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    authority to convene military commissions in appropriate circum\n    stances, see, e.g., id., at 518, there is nothing in the AUMF\u2019s text or leg\n    islative history even hinting that Congress intended to expand or alter\n    the authorization set forth in UCMJ Art. 21. Cf. Ex parte Yerger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88072\"><a href=\"/opinion/88072/ex-parte-yerger/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span>\n    <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 105. Likewise, the DTA cannot be read to authorize this\n    commission. Although the DTA, unlike either Art. 21 or the AUMF,\n    was enacted after the President convened Hamdan\u2019s commission, it\n    contains no language authorizing that tribunal or any other at Guan\n    tanamo Bay. Together, the UCMJ, the AUMF, and the DTA at most\n    acknowledge a general Presidential authority to convene military\n    commissions in circumstances where justified under the Constitution\n    and laws, including the law of war. Absent a more specific congres\n    sional authorization, this Court\u2019s task is, as it was in Quirin, to de\n    cide whether Hamdan\u2019s military commission is so justified. Pp. 25\u2013\n    30.\n       4. The military commission at issue lacks the power to proceed be\n    cause its structure and procedures violate both the UCMJ and the\n    four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949. Pp. 49\u201372.\n          (a) The commission\u2019s procedures, set forth in Commission Order\n    No. 1, provide, among other things, that an accused and his civilian\n    counsel may be excluded from, and precluded from ever learning\n    what evidence was presented during, any part of the proceeding the\n    official who appointed the commission or the presiding officer decides\n    to \u201cclose.\u201d Grounds for closure include the protection of classified in\n    formation, the physical safety of participants and witnesses, the pro\n    tection of intelligence and law enforcement sources, methods, or ac\n    tivities, and \u201cother national security interests.\u201d Appointed military\n    defense counsel must be privy to these closed sessions, but may, at\n    the presiding officer\u2019s discretion, be forbidden to reveal to the client\n    what took place therein. Another striking feature is that the rules\n    governing Hamdan\u2019s commission permit the admission of any evi\n    dence that, in the presiding officer\u2019s opinion, would have probative\n    value to a reasonable person. Moreover, the accused and his civilian\n    counsel may be denied access to classified and other \u201cprotected in\n    formation,\u201d so long as the presiding officer concludes that the evi\n    dence is \u201cprobative\u201d and that its admission without the accused\u2019s\n    knowledge would not result in the denial of a full and fair trial. Pp.\n    49\u201352.\n          (b) The Government objects to this Court\u2019s consideration of a pro\n    cedural challenge at this stage on the grounds, inter alia, that Ham\n    dan will be able to raise such a challenge following a final decision\n    under the DTA, and that there is no basis to presume, before the trial\n    has even commenced, that it will not be conducted in good faith and\n    according to law. These contentions are unsound. First, because\n                   Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                      5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nHamdan apparently is not subject to the death penalty (at least as\nmatters now stand) and may receive a prison sentence shorter than\n10 years, he has no automatic right to federal-court review of the\ncommission\u2019s \u201cfinal decision\u201d under DTA \u00a71005(e)(3). Second, there is\na basis to presume that the procedures employed during Hamdan\u2019s\ntrial will violate the law: He will be, and indeed already has been, ex\ncluded from his own trial. Thus, review of the procedures in advance\nof a \u201cfinal decision\u201d is appropriate. Pp. 52\u201353.\n     (c) Because UCMJ Article 36 has not been complied with here,\nthe rules specified for Hamdan\u2019s commission trial are illegal. The\nprocedures governing such trials historically have been the same as\nthose governing courts-martial. Although this uniformity principle is\nnot inflexible and does not preclude all departures from courts-\nmartial procedures, any such departure must be tailored to the exi\ngency that necessitates it. That understanding is reflected in Art.\n36(b), which provides that the procedural rules the President prom\nulgates for courts-martial and military commissions alike must be\n\u201cuniform insofar as practicable,\u201d 10 U. S. C. \u00a7836(b). The \u201cpractica\nbility\u201d determination the President has made is insufficient to justify\nvariances from the procedures governing courts-martial. The Presi\ndent here has determined, pursuant to the requirement of Art. 36(a),\nthat it is impracticable to apply the rules and principles of law that\ngovern \u201cthe trial of criminal cases in the United States district\ncourts\u201d to Hamdan\u2019s commission. The President has not, however,\nmade a similar official determination that it is impracticable to apply\nthe rules for courts-martial. And even if subsection (b)\u2019s require\nments could be satisfied without an official practicability determina\ntion, that subsection\u2019s requirements are not satisfied here. Nothing\nin the record demonstrates that it would be impracticable to apply\ncourt-martial rules here. There is no suggestion, e.g., of any logistical\ndifficulty in securing properly sworn and authenticated evidence or in\napplying the usual principles of relevance and admissibility. It is not\nevident why the danger posed by international terrorism, consider\nable though it is, should require, in the case of Hamdan\u2019s trial, any\nvariance from the courts-martial rules. The absence of any showing\nof impracticability is particularly disturbing when considered in light\nof the clear and admitted failure to apply one of the most fundamen\ntal protections afforded not just by the Manual for Courts-Martial but\nalso by the UCMJ itself: The right to be present. See 10 U. S. C. A.\n\u00a7839(c). Because the jettisoning of so basic a right cannot lightly be\nexcused as \u201cpracticable,\u201d the courts-martial rules must apply.

Circuit dismissed Hamdan\u2019s challenge\n    in this regard on the grounds, inter alia, that the Conventions are not\n    judicially enforceable and that, in any event, Hamdan is not entitled\n    to their protections. Neither of these grounds is persuasive. Pp. 62\u2013\n    68.\n             (i) The appeals court relied on a statement in Johnson v. Eisen\n    trager, 339 U. S. 763, 789, n. 14, suggesting that this Court lacked\n    power even to consider the merits of a Convention argument because\n    the political and military authorities had sole responsibility for ob\n    serving and enforcing prisoners\u2019 rights under the Convention. How\n    ever, Eisentrager does not control here because, regardless of the na\n    ture of the rights conferred on Hamdan, cf. United States v. Rauscher,\n    119 U. S. 407, they are indisputably part of the law of war, see\n    Hamdi, 542 U. S., at 520\u2013521, compliance with which is the condition\n    upon which UCMJ Art. 21 authority is granted. Pp. 63\u201365.\n             (ii) Alternatively, the appeals court agreed with the Govern\n    ment that the Conventions do not apply because Hamdan was cap\n    tured during the war with al Qaeda, which is not a Convention signa\n    tory, and that conflict is distinct from the war with signatory\n    Afghanistan. The Court need not decide the merits of this argument\n    because there is at least one provision of the Geneva Conventions\n    that applies here even if the relevant conflict is not between signato\n    ries. Common Article 3, which appears in all four Conventions, pro\n    vides that, in a \u201cconflict not of an international character occurring in\n    the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties [i.e., signatories],\n    each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum,\u201d\n    certain provisions protecting \u201c[p]ersons . . . placed hors de combat by\n    . . . detention,\u201d including a prohibition on \u201cthe passing of sentences\n    . . . without previous judgment . . . by a regularly constituted court af\n    fording all the judicial guarantees . . . recognized as indispensable by\n    civilized peoples.\u201d The D. C. Circuit ruled Common Article 3 inappli\n    cable to Hamdan because the conflict with al Qaeda is international\n    in scope and thus not a \u201cconflict not of an international character. \u201d\n    That reasoning is erroneous. That the quoted phrase bears its literal\n    meaning and is used here in contradistinction to a conflict between\n    nations is demonstrated by Common Article 2, which limits its own\n    application to any armed conflict between signatories and provides\n    that signatories must abide by all terms of the Conventions even if\n    another party to the conflict is a nonsignatory, so long as the nonsig\n    natory \u201caccepts and applies\u201d those terms. Common Article 3, by con\n    trast, affords some minimal protection, falling short of full protection\n    under the Conventions, to individuals associated with neither a sig\n    natory nor even a nonsignatory who are involved in a conflict \u201cin the\n                   Cite as: 548 U.

The latter kind of conflict does not involve a\nclash between nations (whether signatories or not). Pp. 65\u201368.\n        (iii) While Common Article 3 does not define its \u201cregularly con\nstituted court\u201d phrase, other sources define the words to mean an\n\u201cordinary military cour[t]\u201d that is \u201cestablished and organized in ac\ncordance with the laws and procedures already in force in a country.\u201d\nThe regular military courts in our system are the courts-martial es\ntablished by congressional statute. At a minimum, a military com\nmission can be \u201cregularly constituted\u201d only if some practical need ex\nplains deviations from court-martial practice. No such need has been\ndemonstrated here. Pp. 69\u201370.\n        (iv) Common Article 3\u2019s requirements are general, crafted to\naccommodate a wide variety of legal systems, but they are require\nments nonetheless. The commission convened to try Hamdan does\nnot meet those requirements. P. 72.\n      (d) Even assuming that Hamden is a dangerous individual who\nwould cause great harm or death to innocent civilians given the op\nportunity, the Executive nevertheless must comply with the prevail\ning rule of law in undertaking to try him and subject him to criminal\npunishment. P. 72.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by JUSTICE SOUTER, JUSTICE GINSBURG,\nand JUSTICE BREYER, concluded in Parts V and VI\u2013D\u2013iv:\n   1. The Government has not charged Hamdan with an \u201coffense . . .\nthat by the law of war may be tried by military commission,\u201d 10\nU. S. C. \u00a7821. Of the three sorts of military commissions used his\ntorically, the law-of-war type used in Quirin and other cases is the\nonly model available to try Hamdan. Among the preconditions, in\ncorporated in Article of War 15 and, later, UCMJ Art. 21, for such a\ntribunal\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction are, inter alia, that it must be lim\nited to trying offenses committed within the convening commander\u2019s\nfield of command, i.e., within the theater of war, and that the offense\ncharged must have been committed during, not before or after, the\nwar. Here, Hamdan is not alleged to have committed any overt act in\na theater of war or on any specified date after September 11, 2001.\nMore importantly, the offense alleged is not triable by law-of-war\nmilitary commission. Although the common law of war may render\ntriable by military commission certain offenses not defined by stat\nute, Quirin, 317 U. S., at 30, the precedent for doing so with respect\nto a particular offense must be plain and unambiguous, cf., e.g., Lov\ning v. United States, 517 U. S. 748, 771. That burden is far from satis\nfied here. The crime of \u201cconspiracy\u201d has rarely if ever been tried as\nsuch in this country by any law-of-war military commission not exer\ncising some other form of jurisdiction, and does not appear in either\nthe Geneva Conventions or the Hague Conventions\u2014the major trea\n8                        HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ties on the law of war. Moreover, that conspiracy is not a recognized\n    violation of the law of war is confirmed by other international\n    sources, including, e.g., the International Military Tribunal at Nur\n    emberg, which pointedly refused to recognize conspiracy to commit\n    war crimes as such a violation. Because the conspiracy charge does\n    not support the commission\u2019s jurisdiction, the commission lacks au\n    thority to try Hamdan. Pp. 30\u201349.\n       2. The phrase \u201call the guarantees . . . recognized as indispensable\n    by civilized peoples\u201d in Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions\n    is not defined, but it must be understood to incorporate at least the\n    barest of the trial protections recognized by customary international\n    law. The procedures adopted to try Hamdan deviate from those gov\n    erning courts-martial in ways not justified by practical need, and\n    thus fail to afford the requisite guarantees. Moreover, various provi\n    sions of Commission Order No. 1 dispense with the principles, which\n    are indisputably part of customary international law, that an accused\n    must, absent disruptive conduct or consent, be present for his trial\n    and must be privy to the evidence against him.

In November 2001, during hostilities between the\nUnited States and the Taliban (which then governed\nAfghanistan), Hamdan was captured by militia forces and\nturned over to the U. S. military. In June 2002, he was\ntransported to Guantanamo Bay. Over a year later, the\nPresident deemed him eligible for trial by military com\nmission for then-unspecified crimes. After another year\nhad passed, Hamdan was charged with one count of con\nspiracy \u201cto commit . . . offenses triable by military com\nmission.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a.\n  Hamdan filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus and\nmandamus to challenge the Executive Branch\u2019s intended\nmeans of prosecuting this charge. He concedes that a\n2                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt-martial constituted in accordance with the Uniform\nCode of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S. C. \u00a7801 et seq.\n(2000 ed. and Supp. III), would have authority to try him.\nHis objection is that the military commission the Presi\ndent has convened lacks such authority, for two principal\nreasons: First, neither congressional Act nor the common\nlaw of war supports trial by this commission for the crime\nof conspiracy\u2014an offense that, Hamdan says, is not a\nviolation of the law of war. Second, Hamdan contends, the\nprocedures that the President has adopted to try him\nviolate the most basic tenets of military and international\nlaw, including the principle that a defendant must be\npermitted to see and hear the evidence against him.\n  The District Court granted Hamdan\u2019s request for a writ\nof habeas corpus. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2368563\"><a href=\"/opinion/2368563/hamdan-v-rumsfeld/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Recognizing, as we did over\na half-century ago, that trial by military commission is an\nextraordinary measure raising important questions about\nthe balance of powers in our constitutional structure,\nEx parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1, 19 (1942), we granted certio\nrari. 546 U. S. ___ (2005).\n  For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the mili\ntary commission convened to try Hamdan lacks power to\nproceed because its structure and procedures violate both\nthe UCMJ and the Geneva Conventions. Four of us also\nconclude, see Part V, infra, that the offense with which\nHamdan has been charged is not an \u201coffens[e] that by . . .\nthe law of war may be tried by military commissions.\u201d 10\nU.

Nearly 3,000 civilians\nwere killed.\n   Congress responded by adopting a Joint Resolution\nauthorizing the President to \u201cuse all necessary and appro\npriate force against those nations, organizations, or per\nsons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or\naided the terrorist attacks . . . in order to prevent any\nfuture acts of international terrorism against the United\nStates by such nations, organizations or persons.\u201d Au\nthorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), 115 Stat.\n224, note following 50 U. S. C. \u00a71541 (2000 ed., Supp. III).\nActing pursuant to the AUMF, and having determined\nthat the Taliban regime had supported al Qaeda, the\nPresident ordered the Armed Forces of the United States\nto invade Afghanistan. In the ensuing hostilities, hun\ndreds of individuals, Hamdan among them, were captured\nand eventually detained at Guantanamo Bay.\n   On November 13, 2001, while the United States was\nstill engaged in active combat with the Taliban, the Presi\ndent issued a comprehensive military order intended to\ngovern the \u201cDetention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain\nNon-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism,\u201d 66 Fed. Reg.\n57833 (hereinafter November 13 Order or Order). Those\nsubject to the November 13 Order include any noncitizen\nfor whom the President determines \u201cthere is reason to\nbelieve\u201d that he or she (1) \u201cis or was\u201d a member of al\nQaeda or (2) has engaged or participated in terrorist ac\ntivities aimed at or harmful to the United States. Id., at\n57834. Any such individual \u201cshall, when tried, be tried by\nmilitary commission for any and all offenses triable by\nmilitary commission that such individual is alleged to\nhave committed, and may be punished in accordance with\nthe penalties provided under applicable law, including\nimprisonment or death.\u201d Ibid. The November 13 Order\nvested in the Secretary of Defense the power to appoint\n4                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmilitary commissions to try individuals subject to the\nOrder, but that power has since been delegated to John D.\nAltenberg, Jr., a retired Army major general and longtime\nmilitary lawyer who has been designated \u201cAppointing\nAuthority for Military Commissions.\u201d\n   On July 3, 2003, the President announced his determi\nnation that Hamdan and five other detainees at Guan\ntanamo Bay were subject to the November 13 Order and\nthus triable by military commission. In December 2003,\nmilitary counsel was appointed to represent Hamdan.\nTwo months later, counsel filed demands for charges and\nfor a speedy trial pursuant to Article 10 of the UCMJ, 10\nU. S. C. \u00a7810. On February 23, 2004, the legal adviser to\nthe Appointing Authority denied the applications, ruling\nthat Hamdan was not entitled to any of the protections of\nthe UCMJ. Not until July 13, 2004, after Hamdan had\ncommenced this action in the United States District Court\nfor the Western District of Washington, did the Govern\nment finally charge him with the offense for which, a year\nearlier, he had been deemed eligible for trial by military\ncommission.\n   The charging document, which is unsigned, contains 13\nnumbered paragraphs. The first two paragraphs recite\nthe asserted bases for the military commission\u2019s jurisdic\ntion\u2014namely, the November 13 Order and the President\u2019s\nJuly 3, 2003, declaration that Hamdan is eligible for trial\nby military commission. The next nine paragraphs, collec\ntively entitled \u201cGeneral Allegations,\u201d describe al Qaeda\u2019s\nactivities from its inception in 1989 through 2001 and\nidentify Osama bin Laden as the group\u2019s leader. Hamdan\nis not mentioned in these paragraphs.\n   Only the final two paragraphs, entitled \u201cCharge: Con\nspiracy,\u201d contain allegations against Hamdan.

Id., at 65a\u201367a.\n  After this formal charge was filed, the United States\nDistrict Court for the Western District of Washington\ntransferred Hamdan\u2019s habeas and mandamus petitions to\nthe United States District Court for the District of Colum\nbia. Meanwhile, a Combatant Status Review Tribunal\n(CSRT) convened pursuant to a military order issued on\nJuly 7, 2004, decided that Hamdan\u2019s continued detention\nat Guantanamo Bay was warranted because he was an\n\u201cenemy combatant.\u201d1 Separately, proceedings before the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 An \u201cenemy combatant\u201d is defined by the military order as \u201can indi\n\nvidual who was part of or supporting Taliban or al Qaeda forces, or\nassociated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United\n6                    HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nmilitary commission commenced.\n   On November 8, 2004, however, the District Court\ngranted Hamdan\u2019s petition for habeas corpus and stayed\nthe commission\u2019s proceedings. It concluded that the\nPresident\u2019s authority to establish military commissions\nextends only to \u201coffenders or offenses triable by military\n[commission] under the law of war,\u201d 344 F. Supp. 2d, at\n158; that the law of war includes the Geneva Convention\n(III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug.\n12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316, T. I. A. S. No. 3364 (Third\nGeneva Convention); that Hamdan is entitled to the full\nprotections of the Third Geneva Convention until ad\njudged, in compliance with that treaty, not to be a prisoner\nof war; and that, whether or not Hamdan is properly\nclassified as a prisoner of war, the military commission\nconvened to try him was established in violation of both\nthe UCMJ and Common Article 3 of the Third Geneva\nConvention because it had the power to convict based on\nevidence the accused would never see or hear. 344\nF. Supp. 2d, at 158\u2013172.\n   The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Cir\ncuit reversed. Like the District Court, the Court of Ap\npeals declined the Government\u2019s invitation to abstain from\nconsidering Hamdan\u2019s challenge. Cf. Schlesinger v. Coun\ncilman, 420 U. S. 738 (1975). On the merits, the panel\nrejected the District Court\u2019s further conclusion that Ham\ndan was entitled to relief under the Third Geneva Conven\ntion. All three judges agreed that the Geneva Conventions\nwere not \u201cjudicially enforceable,\u201d 415 F. 3d, at 38, and two\nthought that the Conventions did not in any event apply to\nHamdan, id., at 40\u201342; but see id., at 44 (Williams, J.,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nStates or its coalition partners.\u201d Memorandum from Deputy Secretary\nof Defense Paul Wolfowitz re: Order Establishing Combatant Status\nReview Tribunal \u00a7a (Jul. 7, 2004), available at http://www.defense\nlink.mil/news/Jul2004/d20040707review.pdf (all Internet materials as\nvisited June 26, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

In other portions of its opinion, the court con\ncluded that our decision in Quirin foreclosed any separation-\nof-powers objection to the military commission\u2019s jurisdiction,\nand held that Hamdan\u2019s trial before the contemplated com\nmission would violate neither the UCMJ nor U. S. Armed\nForces regulations intended to implement the Geneva Con\nventions. 415 F. 3d, at 38, 42\u201343.\n   On November 7, 2005, we granted certiorari to decide\nwhether the military commission convened to try Hamdan\nhas authority to do so, and whether Hamdan may rely on\nthe Geneva Conventions in these proceedings.\n                              II\n  On February 13, 2006, the Government filed a motion to\ndismiss the writ of certiorari. The ground cited for dis\nmissal was the recently enacted Detainee Treatment Act\nof 2005 (DTA), Pub. L. 109\u2013148, 119 Stat. 2739.

RUMSFELD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe subsection contains three numbered paragraphs. The\nfirst paragraph amends the judicial code as follows:\n      \u201c(1) IN GENERAL.\u2014Section 2241 of title 28, United\n    States Code, is amended by adding at the end the\n    following:\n         .         .        .          .          .\n       \u201c \u2018(e) Except as provided in section 1005 of the De\n    tainee Treatment Act of 2005, no court, justice, or\n    judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider\u2014\n       \u201c \u2018(1) an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed\n    by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Depart\n    ment of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; or\n       \u201c \u2018(2) any other action against the United States or\n    its agents relating to any aspect of the detention by\n    the Department of Defense of an alien at Guantanamo\n    Bay, Cuba, who\u2014\n       \u201c \u2018(A) is currently in military custody; or\n       \u201c \u2018(B) has been determined by the United States\n    Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\n    in accordance with the procedures set forth in section\n    1005(e) of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 to have\n    been properly detained as an enemy combatant.\u2019 \u201d\n    \u00a71005(e), id., at 2741\u20132742.\n   Paragraph (2) of subsection (e) vests in the Court of\nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit the \u201cexclusive\njurisdiction to determine the validity of any final decision\nof a [CSRT] that an alien is properly designated as an\nenemy combatant.\u201d Paragraph (2) also delimits the scope\nof that review. See \u00a7\u00a71005(e)(2)(C)(i)\u2013(ii), id., at 2742.\n   Paragraph (3) mirrors paragraph (2) in structure, but\ngoverns judicial review of final decisions of military\ncommissions, not CSRTs.

The scope of review is limited to the\nfollowing inquiries:\n       \u201c(i) whether the final decision [of the military com\n     mission] was consistent with the standards and pro\n     cedures specified in the military order referred to in\n     subparagraph (A); and\n       \u201c(ii) to the extent the Constitution and laws of the\n     United States are applicable, whether the use of such\n     standards and procedures to reach the final decision\n     is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the\n     United States.\u201d \u00a71005(e)(3)(D), ibid.\n Finally, \u00a71005 contains an \u201ceffective date\u201d provision,\nwhich reads as follows:\n       \u201c(1) IN GENERAL.\u2014This section shall take effect on\n     the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       \u201c(2) REVIEW OF COMBATANT STATUS TRIBUNAL AND\n     MILITARY COMMISSION DECISIONS.\u2014Paragraphs (2)\n     and (3) of subsection (e) shall apply with respect to\n     any claim whose review is governed by one of such\n     paragraphs and that is pending on or after the date of\n     the enactment of this Act.\u201d \u00a71005(h), id., at 2743\u2013\n     2744.3\nThe Act is silent about whether paragraph (1) of subsec\ntion (e) \u201cshall apply\u201d to claims pending on the date of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The military order referenced in this section is discussed further in\n\nParts III and VI, infra.\n  3 The penultimate subsections of \u00a71005 emphasize that the provision\n\ndoes not \u201cconfer any constitutional right on an alien detained as an\nenemy combatant outside the United States\u201d and that the \u201cUnited\nStates\u201d does not, for purposes of \u00a71005, include Guantanamo Bay.\n\u00a7\u00a71005(f)\u2013(g).\n10                    HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nenactment.\n   The Government argues that \u00a7\u00a71005(e)(1) and 1005(h)\nhad the immediate effect, upon enactment, of repealing\nfederal jurisdiction not just over detainee habeas actions\nyet to be filed but also over any such actions then pending\nin any federal court\u2014including this Court. Accordingly, it\nargues, we lack jurisdiction to review the Court of Appeals\u2019\ndecision below.\n   Hamdan objects to this theory on both constitutional\nand statutory grounds. Principal among his constitutional\narguments is that the Government\u2019s preferred reading\nraises grave questions about Congress\u2019 authority to im\npinge upon this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction, particularly\nin habeas cases. Support for this argument is drawn from\nEx parte Yerger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88072\"><a href=\"/opinion/88072/ex-parte-yerger/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1869), in which, having ex\nplained that \u201cthe denial to this court of appellate jurisdic\ntion\u201d to consider an original writ of habeas corpus would\n\u201cgreatly weaken the efficacy of the writ,\u201d id., at 102\u2013103,\nwe held that Congress would not be presumed to have\neffected such denial absent an unmistakably clear state\nment to the contrary.

Hamdan also suggests that, if the Gov\nernment\u2019s reading is correct, Congress has unconstitution\nally suspended the writ of habeas corpus.\n   We find it unnecessary to reach either of these argu\nments. Ordinary principles of statutory construction suffice\nto rebut the Government\u2019s theory\u2014at least insofar as this\ncase, which was pending at the time the DTA was enacted,\nis concerned.\n   The Government acknowledges that only paragraphs (2)\nand (3) of subsection (e) are expressly made applicable to\npending cases, see \u00a71005(h)(2), 119 Stat. 2743\u20132744, but\nargues that the omission of paragraph (1) from the scope\nof that express statement is of no moment. This is so, we\nare told, because Congress\u2019 failure to expressly reserve\nfederal courts\u2019 jurisdiction over pending cases erects a\npresumption against jurisdiction, and that presumption is\nrebutted by neither the text nor the legislative history of\nthe DTA.\n   The first part of this argument is not entirely without\nsupport in our precedents. We have in the past \u201capplied\nintervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction,\nwhether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying con\nduct occurred or when the suit was filed.\u201d Landgraf v.\nUSI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 274 (1994) (citing\nBruner v. United States, 343 U. S. 112 (1952); Hallowell v.\nCommons, 239 U. S. 506 (1916)); see Republic of Austria v.\nAltmann, 541 U. S. 677, 693 (2004). But the \u201cpresump\ntion\u201d that these cases have applied is more accurately\nviewed as the nonapplication of another presumption\u2014\nviz., the presumption against retroactivity\u2014in certain\nlimited circumstances.5 If a statutory provision \u201cwould\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntaken, be, and the same is hereby repealed.\u2019 \u201d 7 Wall., at 508.\n  5 See Hughes Aircraft Co. v.

S., at 280. We have explained, however, that,\nunlike other intervening changes in the law, a jurisdiction-\nconferring or jurisdiction-stripping statute usually \u201ctakes\naway no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal\nthat is to hear the case.\u201d Hallowell, 239 U. S., at 508. If\nthat is truly all the statute does, no retroactivity problem\narises because the change in the law does not \u201cimpair\nrights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party\u2019s\nliability for past conduct, or impose new duties with re\nspect to transactions already completed.\u201d Landgraf, 511\nU. S., at 280.6 And if a new rule has no retroactive effect,\nthe presumption against retroactivity will not prevent its\napplication to a case that was already pending when the\nnew rule was enacted.\n   That does not mean, however, that all jurisdiction-\nstripping provisions\u2014or even all such provisions that\ntruly lack retroactive effect\u2014must apply to cases pending\nat the time of their enactment.7 \u201c[N]ormal rules of con\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\napplicable presumption against retroactivity . . .\u201d).\n   6 Cf.

None of those cases says that the\nabsence of an express provision reserving jurisdiction over pending\ncases trumps or renders irrelevant any other indications of congres\nsional intent. Indeed, Bruner itself relied on such other indications\u2013\nincluding a negative inference drawn from the statutory text, cf. infra,\nat 13\u2013to support its conclusion that jurisdiction was not available. The\nCourt observed that (1) Congress had been put on notice by prior lower\n                      Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                     13\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nstruction,\u201d including a contextual reading of the statutory\nlanguage, may dictate otherwise. Lindh v. Murphy, 521\nU. S. 320, 326 (1997).8 A familiar principle of statutory\nconstruction, relevant both in Lindh and here, is that a\nnegative inference may be drawn from the exclusion of\nlanguage from one statutory provision that is included in\nother provisions of the same statute. See id., at 330; see\nalso, e.g., Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983)\n(\u201c \u2018[W]here Congress includes particular language in one\nsection of a statute but omits it in another section of the\nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts\nintentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or\nexclusion\u2019 \u201d). The Court in Lindh relied on this reasoning\nto conclude that certain limitations on the availability of\nhabeas relief imposed by AEDPA applied only to cases\nfiled after that statute\u2019s effective date. Congress\u2019 failure to\nidentify the temporal reach of those limitations, which\ngoverned noncapital cases, stood in contrast to its express\ncommand in the same legislation that new rules governing\nhabeas petitions in capital cases \u201capply to cases pending\non or after the date of enactment.\u201d \u00a7107(c), 110 Stat. 1226;\nsee Lindh, 521 U. S., at 329\u2013330. That contrast, combined\nwith the fact that the amendments at issue \u201caffect[ed]\nsubstantive entitlement to relief,\u201d id., at 327, warranted\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncourt cases addressing the Tucker Act that it ought to specifically\nreserve jurisdiction over pending cases, see 343 U. S., at 115, and (2) in\ncontrast to the congressional silence concerning reservation of jurisdic\ntion, reservation had been made of \u201c \u2018any rights or liabilities\u2019 existing at\nthe effective date of the Act\u201d repealed by another provision of the Act,\nibid., n. 7.\n   8 The question in Lindh was whether new limitations on the avail\n\nability of habeas relief imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective\nDeath Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, applied to habeas\nactions pending on the date of AEDPA\u2019s enactment. We held that they\ndid not. At the outset, we rejected the State\u2019s argument that, in the\nabsence of a clear congressional statement to the contrary, a \u201cproce\ndural\u201d rule must apply to pending cases. 521 U. S., at 326.\n14                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndrawing a negative inference.\n  A like inference follows a fortiori from Lindh in this\ncase. \u201cIf . . . Congress was reasonably concerned to ensure\nthat [\u00a7\u00a71005(e)(2) and (3)] be applied to pending cases, it\nshould have been just as concerned about [\u00a71005(e)(1)],\nunless it had the different intent that the latter [section]\nnot be applied to the general run of pending cases.\u201d Id., at\n329. If anything, the evidence of deliberate omission is\nstronger here than it was in Lindh. In Lindh, the provi\nsions to be contrasted had been drafted separately but\nwere later \u201cjoined together and . . . considered simultane\nously when the language raising the implication was\ninserted.\u201d Id., at 330. We observed that Congress\u2019 tandem\nreview and approval of the two sets of provisions strength\nened the presumption that the relevant omission was\ndeliberate. Id., at 331; see also Field v. Mans, 516 U. S.\n59, 75 (1995) (\u201cThe more apparently deliberate the con\ntrast, the stronger the inference, as applied, for example,\nto contrasting statutory sections originally enacted simul\ntaneously in relevant respects\u201d). Here, Congress not only\nconsidered the respective temporal reaches of paragraphs\n(1), (2), and (3) of subsection (e) together at every stage,\nbut omitted paragraph (1) from its directive that para\ngraphs (2) and (3) apply to pending cases only after having\nrejected earlier proposed versions of the statute that would\nhave included what is now paragraph (1) within the scope\nof that directive. Compare DTA \u00a71005(h)(2), 119 Stat.\n2743\u20132744, with 151 Cong. Rec. S12655 (Nov. 10, 2005) (S.\nAmdt. 2515); see id., at S14257\u2013S14258 (Dec. 21, 2005)\n(discussing similar language proposed in both the House\nand the Senate).9 Congress\u2019 rejection of the very language\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 That paragraph (1), along with paragraphs (2) and (3), is to \u201ctake\n\neffect on the date of enactment,\u201d DTA \u00a71005(h)(1), 119 Stat. 2743, is not\ndispositive; \u201ca \u2018statement that a statute will become effective on a\ncertain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application\nto conduct that occurred at an earlier date.\u2019 \u201d INS v.

See Doe v. Chao, 540 U. S. 614, 621\u2013623 (2004).10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n289, 317 (2001) (quoting Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244,\n257 (1994)). Certainly, the \u201ceffective date\u201d provision cannot bear the\nweight JUSTICE SCALIA would place on it. See post, at 5, and n. 1.\nCongress deemed that provision insufficient, standing alone, to render\nsubsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applicable to pending cases; hence its\nadoption of subsection (h)(2). JUSTICE SCALIA seeks to avoid reducing\nsubsection (h)(2) to a mere redundancy\u2014a consequence he seems to\nacknowledge must otherwise follow from his interpretation\u2014by specu\nlating that Congress had special reasons, not also relevant to subsec\ntion (e)(1), to worry that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) would be ruled\ninapplicable to pending cases. As we explain infra, at 17, and n. 12,\nthat attempt fails.\n   10 We note that statements made by Senators preceding passage of\n\nthe Act lend further support to what the text of the DTA and its draft\ning history already make plain. Senator Levin, one of the sponsors of\nthe final bill, objected to earlier versions of the Act\u2019s \u201ceffective date\u201d\nprovision that would have made subsection (e)(1) applicable to pending\ncases. See, e.g., 151 Cong. Rec. S12667 (Nov. 10, 2005) (amendment\nproposed by Sen. Graham that would have rendered what is now\nsubsection (e)(1) applicable to \u201cany application or other action that is\npending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act\u201d). Senator\nLevin urged adoption of an alternative amendment that \u201cwould apply\nonly to new habeas cases filed after the date of enactment.\u201d Id., at\nS12802 (Nov. 15, 2005). That alternative amendment became the text\nof subsection (h)(2). (In light of the extensive discussion of the DTA\u2019s\neffect on pending cases prior to passage of the Act, see, e.g., id., at\nS12664 (Nov. 10, 2005); id., at S12755 (Nov. 14, 2005); id., at S12799\u2013\nS12802 (Nov. 15, 2005); id., at S14245, S14252\u2013S14253, S14257\u2013\nS14258, S14274\u2013S14275 (Dec. 21, 2005), it cannot be said that the\nchanges to subsection (h)(2) were inconsequential. Cf. post, at 14\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting).)\n   While statements attributed to the final bill\u2019s two other sponsors,\nSenators Graham and Kyl, arguably contradict Senator Levin\u2019s conten\ntion that the final version of the Act preserved jurisdiction over pending\nhabeas cases, see 151 Cong. Rec. S14263\u2013S14264 (Dec. 21, 2005), those\nstatements appear to have been inserted into the Congressional Record\nafter the Senate debate. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 5, n. 6; see also\n151 Cong. Rec. S14260 (statement of Sen.

RUMSFELD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Government nonetheless offers two reasons why, in\nits view, no negative inference may be drawn in favor of\njurisdiction. First, it asserts that Lindh is inapposite\nbecause \u201cSection 1005(e)(1) and (h)(1) remove jurisdiction,\nwhile Section 1005(e)(2), (3) and (h)(2) create an exclusive\nreview mechanism and define the nature of that review.\u201d\nReply Brief in Support of Respondents\u2019 Motion to Dismiss\n4. Because the provisions being contrasted \u201caddress\nwholly distinct subject matters,\u201d Martin v. Hadix, 527\nU. S. 343, 356 (1999), the Government argues, Congress\u2019\ndifferent treatment of them is of no significance.\n   This argument must fail because it rests on a false dis\ntinction between the \u201cjurisdictional\u201d nature of subsection\n(e)(1) and the \u201cprocedural\u201d character of subsections (e)(2)\nand (e)(3). In truth, all three provisions govern jurisdic\ntion over detainees\u2019 claims; subsection (e)(1) addresses\njurisdiction in habeas cases and other actions \u201crelating to\nany aspect of the detention,\u201d while subsections (e)(2) and\n(3) vest exclusive,11 but limited, jurisdiction in the Court of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nfor fiscal year 2006\u201d (emphasis added)). All statements made during\nthe debate itself support Senator Levin\u2019s understanding that the final\ntext of the DTA would not render subsection (e)(1) applicable to pend\ning cases. See, e.g., id., at S14245, S14252\u2013S14253, S14274\u2013S14275\n(Dec. 21, 2005). The statements that JUSTICE SCALIA cites as evidence\nto the contrary construe subsection (e)(3) to strip this Court of jurisdic\ntion, see post, at 12, n. 4 (dissenting opinion) (quoting 151 Cong. Rec.\nS12796 (Nov. 15, 2005) (statement of Sen. Specter))\u2014a construction\nthat the Government has expressly disavowed in this litigation, see n.\n11, infra.

Post, at 8 (dissenting opin\nion); see also Reply Brief in Support of Respondents\u2019 Mo\ntion to Dismiss 5\u20136. That theory is insupportable.

S. 677 (2004), and Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United\nStates ex rel. Schumer, 520 U. S. 939 (1997). See post, at 8.

S., at 695, and n. 15; Hughes Aircraft, 520 U. S., at\n951, we have applied the same analysis to statutes that have jurisdic\ntion-stripping effect, see Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.

RUMSFELD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity ques\ntions under our precedents. The provisions impose no\nadditional liability or obligation on any private party or\neven on the United States, unless one counts the burden of\nlitigating an appeal\u2014a burden not a single one of our\ncases suggests triggers retroactivity concerns.13 Moreover,\nit strains credulity to suggest that the desire to reinforce\nthe application of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) to pending\ncases drove Congress to exclude subsection (e)(1) from\n\u00a71005(h)(2).\n   The Government\u2019s second objection is that applying\nsubsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) but not (e)(1) to pending cases\n\u201cproduces an absurd result\u201d because it grants (albeit only\ntemporarily) dual jurisdiction over detainees\u2019 cases in\ncircumstances where the statute plainly envisions that the\nDistrict of Columbia Circuit will have \u201cexclusive\u201d and\nimmediate jurisdiction over such cases. Reply Brief in\nSupport of Respondents\u2019 Motion to Dismiss 7. But the\npremise here is faulty; subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) grant\njurisdiction only over actions to \u201cdetermine the validity of\nany final decision\u201d of a CSRT or commission. Because\nHamdan, at least, is not contesting any \u201cfinal decision\u201d of\na CSRT or military commission, his action does not fall\nwithin the scope of subsection (e)(2) or (e)(3). There is,\nthen, no absurdity.14\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 See Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 271, n. 25 (observing that \u201cthe great\n\nmajority of our decisions relying upon the antiretroactivity presumption\nhave involved intervening statutes burdening private parties,\u201d though\n\u201cwe have applied the presumption in cases involving new monetary\nobligations that fell only on the government\u201d (emphasis added)); see\nalso Altmann, 541 U. S., at 728\u2013729 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (explain\ning that if retroactivity concerns do not arise when a new monetary\nobligation is imposed on the United States it is because \u201cCongress, by\nvirtue of authoring the legislation, is itself fully capable of protecting\nthe Federal Government from having its rights degraded by retroactive\nlaws\u201d).\n  14 There may be habeas cases that were pending in the lower courts at\n                   Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                19\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Government\u2019s more general suggestion that Con\ngress can have had no good reason for preserving habeas\njurisdiction over cases that had been brought by detainees\nprior to enactment of the DTA not only is belied by the\nlegislative history, see n. 10, supra, but is otherwise with\nout merit. There is nothing absurd about a scheme under\nwhich pending habeas actions\u2014particularly those, like\nthis one, that challenge the very legitimacy of the tribu\nnals whose judgments Congress would like to have re\nviewed\u2014are preserved, and more routine challenges to\nfinal decisions rendered by those tribunals are carefully\nchanneled to a particular court and through a particular\nlens of review.\n   Finally, we cannot leave unaddressed JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s\ncontentions that the \u201cmeaning of \u00a71005(e)(1) is entirely\nclear,\u201d post, at 6, and that \u201cthe plain import of a statute\nrepealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider\nand render judgment\u2014in an already pending case no less\nthan in a case yet to be filed,\u201d post, at 3 (emphasis in\noriginal). Only by treating the Bruner rule as an inflexible\ntrump (a thing it has never been, see n. 7, supra) and\nignoring both the rest of \u00a71005\u2019s text and its drafting\nhistory can one conclude as much. Congress here ex\npressly provided that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applied\nto pending cases. It chose not to so provide\u2014after having\nbeen presented with the option\u2014for subsection (e)(1). The\nomission is an integral part of the statutory scheme that\nmuddies whatever \u201cplain meaning\u201d may be discerned from\nblinkered study of subsection (e)(1) alone. The dissent\u2019s\nspeculation about what Congress might have intended by\nthe omission not only is counterfactual, cf. n. 10, supra\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe time the DTA was enacted that do qualify as challenges to \u201cfinal\ndecision[s]\u201d within the meaning of subsection (e)(2) or (e)(3). We\nexpress no view about whether the DTA would require transfer of such\nan action to the District of Columbia Circuit.\n20                    HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n(recounting legislative history), but rests on both a mis\nconstruction of the DTA and an erroneous view our prece\ndents, see supra, at 17, and n. 12.\n  For these reasons, we deny the Government\u2019s motion to\ndismiss.15\n                              III\n  Relying on our decision in Councilman, 420 U. S. 738,\nthe Government argues that, even if we have statutory\njurisdiction, we should apply the \u201cjudge-made rule that\ncivilian courts should await the final outcome of on-going\nmilitary proceedings before entertaining an attack on\nthose proceedings.\u201d Brief for Respondents 12. Like the\nDistrict Court and the Court of Appeals before us, we\nreject this argument.\n  In Councilman, an army officer on active duty was\nreferred to a court-martial for trial on charges that he\nviolated the UCMJ by selling, transferring, and possessing\nmarijuana. 420 U. S., at 739\u2013740. Objecting that the\nalleged offenses were not \u201c \u2018service connected,\u2019 \u201d id., at 740,\nthe officer filed suit in Federal District Court to enjoin the\nproceedings. He neither questioned the lawfulness of\ncourts-martial or their procedures nor disputed that, as a\nserviceman, he was subject to court-martial jurisdiction.\nHis sole argument was that the subject matter of his case\ndid not fall within the scope of court-martial authority.\nSee id., at 741, 759. The District Court granted his re\nquest for injunctive relief, and the Court of Appeals\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 Because we conclude that \u00a71005(e)(1) does not strip federal courts\u2019\n\njurisdiction over cases pending on the date of the DTA\u2019s enactment, we\ndo not decide whether, if it were otherwise, this Court would nonethe\nless retain jurisdiction to hear Hamdan\u2019s appeal. Cf. supra, at 10. Nor\ndo we decide the manner in which the canon of constitutional avoidance\nshould affect subsequent interpretation of the DTA. See, e.g., St. Cyr,\n533 U. S., at 300 (a construction of a statute \u201cthat would entirely\npreclude review of a pure question of law by any court would give rise\nto substantial constitutional questions\u201d).\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                  21\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\naffirmed.\n   We granted certiorari and reversed. Id., at 761. We did\nnot reach the merits of whether the marijuana charges\nwere sufficiently \u201cservice connected\u201d to place them within\nthe subject-matter jurisdiction of a court-martial. Instead,\nwe concluded that, as a matter of comity, federal courts\nshould normally abstain from intervening in pending\ncourt-martial proceedings against members of the Armed\nForces,16 and further that there was nothing in the par\nticular circumstances of the officer\u2019s case to displace that\ngeneral rule. See id., at 740, 758.\n   Councilman identifies two considerations of comity that\ntogether favor abstention pending completion of ongoing\ncourt-martial proceedings against service personnel. See\nNew v. Cohen, 129 F. 3d 639, 643 (CADC 1997); see also\n415 F. 3d, at 36\u201337 (discussing Councilman and New).\nFirst, military discipline and, therefore, the efficient op\neration of the Armed Forces are best served if the military\njustice system acts without regular interference from\ncivilian courts. See Councilman, 420 U. S., at 752. Sec\nond, federal courts should respect the balance that Con\ngress struck between military preparedness and fairness\nto individual service members when it created \u201can inte\ngrated system of military courts and review procedures, a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  16 Councilman   distinguished service personnel from civilians, whose\nchallenges to ongoing military proceedings are cognizable in federal\ncourt. See, e.g., United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11\n(1955). As we explained in Councilman, abstention is not appropriate\nin cases in which individuals raise \u201c \u2018substantial arguments denying the\nright of the military to try them at all,\u2019 \u201d and in which the legal chal\nlenge \u201cturn[s] on the status of the persons as to whom the military\nasserted its power.\u201d 420 U. S., at 759 (quoting Noyd v. Bond, 395 U. S.\n683, 696, n. 8 (1969)). In other words, we do not apply Councilman\nabstention when there is a substantial question whether a military\ntribunal has personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Because we\nconclude that abstention is inappropriate for a more basic reason, we\nneed not consider whether the jurisdictional exception recognized in\nCouncilman applies here.\n22                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncritical element of which is the Court of Military Appeals,\nconsisting of civilian judges \u2018completely removed from all\nmilitary influence or persuasion . . . .\u2019 \u201d Id., at 758 (quot\ning H. R. Rep. No. 491, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., p. 7 (1949)).\nJust as abstention in the face of ongoing state criminal\nproceedings is justified by our expectation that state\ncourts will enforce federal rights, so abstention in the face\nof ongoing court-martial proceedings is justified by our\nexpectation that the military court system established by\nCongress\u2014with its substantial procedural protections and\nprovision for appellate review by independent civilian\njudges\u2014\u201cwill vindicate servicemen\u2019s constitutional rights,\u201d\n420 U. S., at 758. See id., at 755\u2013758.17\n  The same cannot be said here; indeed, neither of the\ncomity considerations identified in Councilman weighs in\nfavor of abstention in this case. First, Hamdan is not a\nmember of our Nation\u2019s Armed Forces, so concerns about\nmilitary discipline do not apply. Second, the tribunal\nconvened to try Hamdan is not part of the integrated\nsystem of military courts, complete with independent\nreview panels, that Congress has established. Unlike the\nofficer in Councilman, Hamdan has no right to appeal any\nconviction to the civilian judges of the Court of Military\nAppeals (now called the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Armed Forces, see Pub. L. 103\u2013337, 108 Stat.\n2831). Instead, under Dept. of Defense Military Commis\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  17 See also Noyd, 395 U. S., at 694\u2013696 (noting that the Court of Mili\ntary Appeals consisted of \u201cdisinterested civilian judges,\u201d and concluding\nthat there was no reason for the Court to address an Air Force Captain\u2019s\nargument that he was entitled to remain free from confinement pending\nappeal of his conviction by court-martial \u201cwhen the highest military\ncourt stands ready to consider petitioner\u2019s arguments\u201d). Cf. Parisi v.\nDavidson, 405 U. S. 34, 41\u201343 (1972) (\u201cUnder accepted principles of\ncomity, the court should stay its hand only if the relief the petitioner\nseeks . . . would also be available to him with reasonable promptness\nand certainty through the machinery of the military judicial system in\nits processing of the court-martial charge\u201d).\n                    Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                  23\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nsion Order No. 1 (Commission Order No. 1), which was\nissued by the President on March 21, 2002, and amended\nmost recently on August 31, 2005, and which governs the\nprocedures for Hamdan\u2019s commission, any conviction\nwould be reviewed by a panel consisting of three military\nofficers designated by the Secretary of Defense. Commis\nsion Order No. 1 \u00a76(H)(4). Commission Order No. 1 pro\nvides that appeal of a review panel\u2019s decision may be had\nonly to the Secretary of Defense himself, \u00a76(H)(5), and\nthen, finally, to the President, \u00a76(H)(6).18\n   We have no doubt that the various individuals assigned\nreview power under Commission Order No. 1 would strive\nto act impartially and ensure that Hamdan receive all\nprotections to which he is entitled. Nonetheless, these\nreview bodies clearly lack the structural insulation from\nmilitary influence that characterizes the Court of Appeals\nfor the Armed Forces, and thus bear insufficient concep\ntual similarity to state courts to warrant invocation of\nabstention principles.19\n   In sum, neither of the two comity considerations under\nlying our decision to abstain in Councilman applies to the\ncircumstances of this case. Instead, this Court\u2019s decision\nin Quirin is the most relevant precedent. In Quirin, seven\nGerman saboteurs were captured upon arrival by subma\nrine in New York and Florida. 317 U. S., at 21. The Presi\ndent convened a military commission to try the saboteurs,\nwho then filed habeas corpus petitions in the United\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  18 If he chooses, the President may delegate this ultimate decision-\n\nmaking authority to the Secretary of Defense. See \u00a76(H)(6).\n  19 JUSTICE SCALIA chides us for failing to include the District of Co\n\nlumbia Circuit\u2019s review powers under the DTA in our description of the\nreview mechanism erected by Commission Order No. 1. See post, at 22.\nWhether or not the limited review permitted under the DTA may be\ntreated as akin to the plenary review exercised by the Court of Appeals\nfor the Armed Forces, petitioner here is not afforded a right to such\nreview. See infra, at 52; \u00a71005(e)(3), 119 Stat. 2743.\n24                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nStates District Court for the District of Columbia challeng\ning their trial by commission. We granted the saboteurs\u2019\npetition for certiorari to the Court of Appeals before judg\nment. See id., at 19. Far from abstaining pending the\nconclusion of military proceedings, which were ongoing,\nwe convened a special Term to hear the case and expedited\nour review. That course of action was warranted, we\nexplained, \u201c[i]n view of the public importance of the ques\ntions raised by [the cases] and of the duty which rests on\nthe courts, in time of war as well as in time of peace, to\npreserve unimpaired the constitutional safeguards of civil\nliberty, and because in our opinion the public interest\nrequired that we consider and decide those questions\nwithout any avoidable delay.\u201d Ibid.\n   As the Court of Appeals here recognized, Quirin \u201cpro\nvides a compelling historical precedent for the power of\ncivilian courts to entertain challenges that seek to inter\nrupt the processes of military commissions.\u201d 415 F. 3d, at\n36.20 The circumstances of this case, like those in Quirin,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   20 Having correctly declined to abstain from addressing Hamdan\u2019s\n\nchallenge to the lawfulness of the military commission convened to try\nhim, the Court of Appeals suggested that Councilman abstention\nnonetheless applied to bar its consideration of one of Hamdan\u2019s argu\nments\u2014namely, that his commission violated Article 3 of the Third\nGeneva Convention, 6 U. S. T. 3316, 3318. See Part VI, infra. Al\nthough the Court of Appeals rejected the Article 3 argument on the\nmerits, it also stated that, because the challenge was not \u201cjurisdic\ntional,\u201d it did not fall within the exception that Schlesinger v. Council\nman, 420 U. S. 738 (1975), recognized for defendants who raise sub\nstantial arguments that a military tribunal lacks personal jurisdiction\nover them. See 415 F. 3d, at 42.\n   In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals conflated two\ndistinct inquiries: (1) whether Hamdan has raised a substantial argu\nment that the military commission lacks authority to try him; and,\nmore fundamentally, (2) whether the comity considerations underlying\nCouncilman apply to trigger the abstention principle in the first place.\nAs the Court of Appeals acknowledged at the beginning of its opinion,\nthe first question warrants consideration only if the answer to the\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                  25\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nsimply do not implicate the \u201cobligations of comity\u201d that,\nunder appropriate circumstances, justify abstention.\nQuackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U. S. 706, 733 (1996)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring).\n   Finally, the Government has identified no other \u201cimpor\ntant countervailing interest\u201d that would permit federal\ncourts to depart from their general \u201cduty to exercise the\njurisdiction that is conferred upon them by Congress.\u201d Id.,\nat 716 (majority opinion). To the contrary, Hamdan and\nthe Government both have a compelling interest in know\ning in advance whether Hamdan may be tried by a mili\ntary commission that arguably is without any basis in law\nand operates free from many of the procedural rules pre\nscribed by Congress for courts-martial\u2014rules intended to\nsafeguard the accused and ensure the reliability of any\nconviction. While we certainly do not foreclose the possi\nbility that abstention may be appropriate in some cases\nseeking review of ongoing military commission proceed\nings (such as military commissions convened on the battle\nfield), the foregoing discussion makes clear that, under our\nprecedent, abstention is not justified here. We therefore\nproceed to consider the merits of Hamdan\u2019s challenge.\n                           IV\n  The military commission, a tribunal neither mentioned\nin the Constitution nor created by statute, was born of\nmilitary necessity. See W. Winthrop, Military Law and\nPrecedents 831 (rev. 2d ed. 1920) (hereinafter Winthrop).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsecond is yes. See 415 F. 3d, at 36\u201337. Since, as the Court of Appeals\nproperly concluded, the answer to the second question is in fact no,\nthere is no need to consider any exception.\n   At any rate, it appears that the exception would apply here. As\ndiscussed in Part VI, infra, Hamdan raises a substantial argument\nthat, because the military commission that has been convened to try\nhim is not a \u201c \u2018regularly constituted court\u2019 \u201d under the Geneva Conven\ntions, it is ultra vires and thus lacks jurisdiction over him.

As commander of occupied\nMexican territory, and having available to him no other\ntribunal, General Winfield Scott that year ordered the\nestablishment of both \u201c \u2018military commissions\u2019 \u201d to try\nordinary crimes committed in the occupied territory and a\n\u201ccouncil of war\u201d to try offenses against the law of war.\nWinthrop 832 (emphases in original).\n   When the exigencies of war next gave rise to a need for\nuse of military commissions, during the Civil War, the\ndual system favored by General Scott was not adopted.\nInstead, a single tribunal often took jurisdiction over\nordinary crimes, war crimes, and breaches of military\norders alike. As further discussed below, each aspect of\nthat seemingly broad jurisdiction was in fact supported by\na separate military exigency. Generally, though, the need\nfor military commissions during this period\u2014as during the\nMexican War\u2014was driven largely by the then very limited\njurisdiction of courts-martial: \u201cThe occasion for the mili\ntary commission arises principally from the fact that the\njurisdiction of the court-martial proper, in our law, is\nrestricted by statute almost exclusively to members of the\nmilitary force and to certain specific offences defined in a\nwritten code.\u201d Id., at 831 (emphasis in original).\n   Exigency alone, of course, will not justify the establish\nment and use of penal tribunals not contemplated by\nArticle I, \u00a78 and Article III, \u00a71 of the Constitution unless\nsome other part of that document authorizes a response to\nthe felt need.

And\nthat authority, if it exists, can derive only from the powers\ngranted jointly to the President and Congress in time of\nwar. See id., at 26\u201329; In re Yamashita, 327 U. S. 1, 11\n(1946).\n   The Constitution makes the President the \u201cCommander\nin Chief\u201d of the Armed Forces, Art.

The inter\nplay between these powers was described by Chief Justice\nChase in the seminal case of Ex parte Milligan:\n     \u201cThe power to make the necessary laws is in Con\n     gress; the power to execute in the President. Both\n     powers imply many subordinate and auxiliary powers.\n     Each includes all authorities essential to its due exer\n     cise. But neither can the President, in war more than\n     in peace, intrude upon the proper authority of Con\n     gress, nor Congress upon the proper authority of the\n     President. . . . Congress cannot direct the conduct of\n     campaigns, nor can the President, or any commander\n     under him, without the sanction of Congress, institute\n     tribunals for the trial and punishment of offences, ei\n     ther of soldiers or civilians, unless in cases of a con\n     trolling necessity, which justifies what it compels, or\n     at least insures acts of indemnity from the justice of\n     the legislature.\u201d 4 Wall., at 139\u2013140.21\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  21 See also Winthrop 831 (\u201c[I]n general, it is those provisions of the\n\nConstitution which empower Congress to \u2018declare war\u2019 and \u2018raise\n28                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Whether Chief Justice Chase was correct in suggesting\nthat the President may constitutionally convene military\ncommissions \u201cwithout the sanction of Congress\u201d in cases of\n\u201ccontrolling necessity\u201d is a question this Court has not\nanswered definitively, and need not answer today. For we\nheld in Quirin that Congress had, through Article of War\n15, sanctioned the use of military commissions in such\ncircumstances. 317 U. S., at 28 (\u201cBy the Articles of War,\nand especially Article 15, Congress has explicitly provided,\nso far as it may constitutionally do so, that military tribu\nnals shall have jurisdiction to try offenders or offenses\nagainst the law of war in appropriate cases\u201d). Article 21 of\nthe UCMJ, the language of which is substantially identical\nto the old Article 15 and was preserved by Congress after\nWorld War II,22 reads as follows:\n     \u201cJurisdiction of courts-martial not exclusive.\n     \u201cThe provisions of this code conferring jurisdiction\n     upon courts-martial shall not be construed as depriv\n     ing military commissions, provost courts, or other\n     military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction in respect\n     of offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of\n     war may be tried by such military commissions, pro\n     vost courts, or other military tribunals.\u201d 64 Stat. 115.\n  We have no occasion to revisit Quirin\u2019s controversial\ncharacterization of Article of War 15 as congressional\nauthorization for military commissions. Cf. Brief for Legal\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\narmies,\u2019 and which, in authorizing the initiation of war, authorize the\nemployment of all necessary and proper agencies for its due prosecu\ntion, from which this tribunal derives its original sanction\u201d (emphasis\nin original)).\n   22 Article 15 was first adopted as part of the Articles of War in 1916.\n\nSee Act of Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 418, \u00a73, Art. 15, 39 Stat. 652. When the\nArticles of War were codified and re-enacted as the UCMJ in 1950,\nCongress determined to retain Article 15 because it had been \u201ccon\nstrued by the Supreme Court (Ex Parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942)).\u201d\nS. Rep. No. 486, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 13 (1949).\n                    Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                 29\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nScholars and Historians as Amici Curiae 12\u201315. Contrary\nto the Government\u2019s assertion, however, even Quirin did\nnot view the authorization as a sweeping mandate for the\nPresident to \u201cinvoke military commissions when he deems\nthem necessary.\u201d Brief for Respondents 17. Rather, the\nQuirin Court recognized that Congress had simply pre\nserved what power, under the Constitution and the com\nmon law of war, the President had had before 1916 to\nconvene military commissions\u2014with the express condition\nthat the President and those under his command comply\nwith the law of war. See 317 U. S., at 28\u201329.23 That much\nis evidenced by the Court\u2019s inquiry, following its conclu\nsion that Congress had authorized military commissions,\ninto whether the law of war had indeed been complied\nwith in that case. See ibid.\n   The Government would have us dispense with the in\nquiry that the Quirin Court undertook and find in either\nthe AUMF or the DTA specific, overriding authorization\nfor the very commission that has been convened to try\nHamdan. Neither of these congressional Acts, however,\nexpands the President\u2019s authority to convene military\ncommissions. First, while we assume that the AUMF\nactivated the President\u2019s war powers, see Hamdi v. Rums\nfeld, 542 U. S. 507 (2004) (plurality opinion), and that\nthose powers include the authority to convene military\ncommissions in appropriate circumstances, see id., at 518;\nQuirin, 317 U. S., at 28\u201329; see also Yamashita, 327 U. S.,\nat 11, there is nothing in the text or legislative history of\nthe AUMF even hinting that Congress intended to expand\nor alter the authorization set forth in Article 21 of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  23 Whether or not the President has independent power, absent con\n\ngressional authorization, to convene military commissions, he may not\ndisregard limitations that Congress has, in proper exercise of its own\nwar powers, placed on his powers. See Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v.\nSawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). The\nGovernment does not argue otherwise.\n30                    HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nUCMJ. Cf. Yerger, 8 Wall., at 105 (\u201cRepeals by implica\ntion are not favored\u201d).24\n   Likewise, the DTA cannot be read to authorize this\ncommission. Although the DTA, unlike either Article 21\nor the AUMF, was enacted after the President had con\nvened Hamdan\u2019s commission, it contains no language\nauthorizing that tribunal or any other at Guantanamo\nBay. The DTA obviously \u201crecognize[s]\u201d the existence of the\nGuantanamo Bay commissions in the weakest sense, Brief\nfor Respondents 15, because it references some of the\nmilitary orders governing them and creates limited judi\ncial review of their \u201cfinal decision[s],\u201d DTA \u00a71005(e)(3),\n119 Stat. 2743. But the statute also pointedly reserves\njudgment on whether \u201cthe Constitution and laws of the\nUnited States are applicable\u201d in reviewing such decisions\nand whether, if they are, the \u201cstandards and procedures\u201d\nused to try Hamdan and other detainees actually violate\nthe \u201cConstitution and laws.\u201d Ibid.\n   Together, the UCMJ, the AUMF, and the DTA at most\nacknowledge a general Presidential authority to convene\nmilitary commissions in circumstances where justified\nunder the \u201cConstitution and laws,\u201d including the law of\nwar. Absent a more specific congressional authorization,\nthe task of this Court is, as it was in Quirin, to decide\nwhether Hamdan\u2019s military commission is so justified. It\nis to that inquiry we now turn.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  24 On this point, it is noteworthy that the Court in Ex parte Quirin,\n\n317 U. S. 1 (1942), looked beyond Congress\u2019 declaration of war and\naccompanying authorization for use of force during World War II, and\nrelied instead on Article of War 15 to find that Congress had authorized\nthe use of military commissions in some circumstances. See id., at 26\u2013\n29. JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019 assertion that we commit \u201cerror\u201d in reading\nArticle 21 of the UCMJ to place limitations upon the President\u2019s use of\nmilitary commissions, see post, at 5 (dissenting opinion), ignores the\nreasoning in Quirin.\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

Commissions historically have been used in\nthree situations. See Bradley & Goldsmith, Congressional\nAuthorization and the War on Terrorism, 118 Harv.\nL. Rev. 2048, 2132\u20132133 (2005); Winthrop 831\u2013846; Hear\nings on H. R. 2498 before the Subcommittee of the House\nCommittee on Armed Services, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 975\n(1949). First, they have substituted for civilian courts at\ntimes and in places where martial law has been declared.\nTheir use in these circumstances has raised constitutional\nquestions, see Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 327 U. S. 304\n(1946); Milligan, 4 Wall., at 121\u2013122, but is well recog\nnized.25 See Winthrop 822, 836\u2013839. Second, commis\nsions have been established to try civilians \u201cas part of a\ntemporary military government over occupied enemy\nterritory or territory regained from an enemy where civil\nian government cannot and does not function.\u201d Duncan,\n327 U. S., at 314; see Milligan, 4 Wall., at 141\u2013142 (Chase,\nC. J., concurring in judgment) (distinguishing \u201cMARTIAL\nLAW PROPER\u201d from \u201cMILITARY GOVERNMENT\u201d in occupied\nterritory). Illustrative of this second kind of commission is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  25 The    justification for, and limitations on, these commissions were\nsummarized in Milligan:\n   \u201cIf, in foreign invasion or civil war, the courts are actually closed, and\nit is impossible to administer criminal justice according to law, then, on\nthe theatre of active military operations, where war really prevails,\nthere is a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority, thus\noverthrown, to preserve the safety of the army and society; and as no\npower is left but the military, it is allowed to govern by martial rule\nuntil the laws can have their free course. As necessity creates the rule,\nso it limits its duration; for, if this government is continued after the\ncourts are reinstated, it is a gross usurpation of power. Martial rule\ncan never exist where the courts are open, and in the proper and\nunobstructed exercise of their jurisdiction. It is also confined to the\nlocality of actual war.\u201d 4 Wall., at 127 (emphases in original).\n32                    HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nthe one that was established, with jurisdiction to apply the\nGerman Criminal Code, in occupied Germany following\nthe end of World War II. See Madsen v. Kinsella, 343\nU. S. 341, 356 (1952).26\n  The third type of commission, convened as an \u201cincident\nto the conduct of war\u201d when there is a need \u201cto seize and\nsubject to disciplinary measures those enemies who in\ntheir attempt to thwart or impede our military effort have\nviolated the law of war,\u201d Quirin, 317 U. S., at 28\u201329, has\nbeen described as \u201cutterly different\u201d from the other two.\nBickers, Military Commissions are Constitutionally Sound:\nA Response to Professors Katyal and Tribe, 34 Tex. Tech.\nL. Rev. 899, 902 (2002\u20132003).27 Not only is its jurisdiction\nlimited to offenses cognizable during time of war, but its\nrole is primarily a factfinding one\u2014to determine, typically\non the battlefield itself, whether the defendant has vio\nlated the law of war. The last time the U. S. Armed Forces\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   26 The limitations on these occupied territory or military government\n\ncommissions are tailored to the tribunals\u2019 purpose and the exigencies\nthat necessitate their use. They may be employed \u201cpending the estab\nlishment of civil government,\u201d Madsen, 343 U. S., at 354\u2013355, which\nmay in some cases extend beyond the \u201ccessation of hostilities,\u201d id., at\n348.\n   27 So much may not be evident on cold review of the Civil War trials\n\noften cited as precedent for this kind of tribunal because the commis\nsions established during that conflict operated as both martial law or\nmilitary government tribunals and law-of-war commissions. Hence,\n\u201cmilitary commanders began the practice [during the Civil War] of\nusing the same name, the same rules, and often the same tribunals\u201d to\ntry both ordinary crimes and war crimes. Bickers, 34 Tex. Tech. L. Rev.,\nat 908. \u201cFor the first time, accused horse thieves and alleged saboteurs\nfound themselves subject to trial by the same military commission.\u201d\nId., at 909. The Civil War precedents must therefore be considered\nwith caution; as we recognized in Quirin, 317 U. S., at 29, and as\nfurther discussed below, commissions convened during time of war but\nunder neither martial law nor military government may try only\noffenses against the law of war.\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                   33\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nused the law-of-war military commission was during\nWorld War II. In Quirin, this Court sanctioned President\nRoosevelt\u2019s use of such a tribunal to try Nazi saboteurs\ncaptured on American soil during the War. 317 U. S. 1.\nAnd in Yamashita, we held that a military commission\nhad jurisdiction to try a Japanese commander for failing to\nprevent troops under his command from committing\natrocities in the Philippines. 327 U. S. 1.\n   Quirin is the model the Government invokes most fre\nquently to defend the commission convened to try Ham\ndan. That is both appropriate and unsurprising. Since\nGuantanamo Bay is neither enemy-occupied territory nor\nunder martial law, the law-of-war commission is the only\nmodel available. At the same time, no more robust model\nof executive power exists; Quirin represents the high-\nwater mark of military power to try enemy combatants for\nwar crimes.\n   The classic treatise penned by Colonel William Win\nthrop, whom we have called \u201cthe \u2018Blackstone of Military\nLaw,\u2019 \u201d Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 19, n. 38 (1957) (plural\nity opinion), describes at least four preconditions for exer\ncise of jurisdiction by a tribunal of the type convened to try\nHamdan. First, \u201c[a] military commission, (except where\notherwise authorized by statute), can legally assume\njurisdiction only of offenses committed within the field of\nthe command of the convening commander.\u201d Winthrop\n836. The \u201cfield of command\u201d in these circumstances means\nthe \u201ctheatre of war.\u201d Ibid. Second, the offense charged\n\u201cmust have been committed within the period of the\nwar.\u201d28 Id., at 837. No jurisdiction exists to try offenses\n\u201ccommitted either before or after the war.\u201d Ibid. Third, a\nmilitary commission not established pursuant to martial\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  28 If the commission is established pursuant to martial law or military\n\ngovernment, its jurisdiction extends to offenses committed within \u201cthe\nexercise of military government or martial law.\u201d Winthrop 837.\n34                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nlaw or an occupation may try only \u201c[i]ndividuals of the\nenemy\u2019s army who have been guilty of illegitimate warfare\nor other offences in violation of the laws of war\u201d and mem\nbers of one\u2019s own army \u201cwho, in time of war, become\nchargeable with crimes or offences not cognizable, or\ntriable, by the criminal courts or under the Articles of\nwar.\u201d Id., at 838. Finally, a law-of-war commission has\njurisdiction to try only two kinds of offense: \u201cViolations of\nthe laws and usages of war cognizable by military tribu\nnals only,\u201d and \u201c[b]reaches of military orders or regula\ntions for which offenders are not legally triable by court-\nmartial under the Articles of war.\u201d Id., at 839.29\n   All parties agree that Colonel Winthrop\u2019s treatise accu\nrately describes the common law governing military com\nmissions, and that the jurisdictional limitations he identi\nfies were incorporated in Article of War 15 and, later,\nArticle 21 of the UCMJ. It also is undisputed that Ham\ndan\u2019s commission lacks jurisdiction to try him unless the\ncharge \u201cproperly set[s] forth, not only the details of the\nact charged, but the circumstances conferring jurisdic\ntion.\u201d Id., at 842 (emphasis in original). The question is\nwhether the preconditions designed to ensure that a mili\ntary necessity exists to justify the use of this extraordi\nnary tribunal have been satisfied here.\n   The charge against Hamdan, described in detail in Part\nI, supra, alleges a conspiracy extending over a number of\nyears, from 1996 to November 2001.30 All but two months\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  29 Winthrop adds as a fifth, albeit not-always-complied-with, criterion\n\nthat \u201cthe trial must be had within the theatre of war . . . ; that, if held\nelsewhere, and where the civil courts are open and available, the\nproceedings and sentence will be coram non judice.\u201d Id., at 836. The\nGovernment does not assert that Guantanamo Bay is a theater of war,\nbut instead suggests that neither Washington, D. C., in 1942 nor the\nPhilippines in 1945 qualified as a \u201cwar zone\u201d either. Brief for Respon\ndents 27; cf. Quirin, 317 U. S. 1; In re Yamashita, 327 U. S. 1 (1946).\n  30 The elements of this conspiracy charge have been defined not by\n\nCongress but by the President. See Military Commission Instruction\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

See post, at 7\u201310\n(dissenting opinion). But even the Government does not go so far;\nalthough the United States had for some time prior to the attacks of\nSeptember 11, 2001, been aggressively pursuing al Qaeda, neither in\nthe charging document nor in submissions before this Court has the\nGovernment asserted that the President\u2019s war powers were activated\nprior to September 11, 2001. Cf. Brief for Respondents 25 (describing\nthe events of September 11, 2001, as \u201can act of war\u201d that \u201ctriggered a\nright to deploy military forces abroad to defend the United States by\ncombating al Qaeda\u201d). JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019 further argument that the\nAUMF is \u201cbackward looking\u201d and therefore authorizes trial by military\ncommission of crimes that occurred prior to the inception of war is\ninsupportable. See post, at 8, n. 3. If nothing else, Article 21 of the\nUCMJ requires that the President comply with the law of war in his\nuse of military commissions. As explained in the text, the law of war\npermits trial only of offenses \u201ccommitted within the period of the war.\u201d\nWinthrop 837; see also Quirin, 317 U. S., at 28\u201329 (observing that law-\nof-war military commissions may be used to try \u201cthose enemies who in\ntheir attempt to thwart or impede our military effort have violated the\nlaw of war\u201d (emphasis added)). The sources that JUSTICE THOMAS relies\non to suggest otherwise simply do not support his position. Colonel\nGreen\u2019s short exegesis on military commissions cites Howland for the\nproposition that \u201c[o]ffenses committed before a formal declaration of\nwar or before the declaration of martial law may be tried by military\ncommission.\u201d The Military Commission, 42 Am. J. Int\u2019l L. 832, 848\n(1948) (emphases added) (cited post, at 9\u201310). Assuming that to be\ntrue, nothing in our analysis turns on the admitted absence of either a\nformal declaration of war or a declaration of martial law. Our focus\ninstead is on the September 11, 2001 attacks that the Government\ncharacterizes as the relevant \u201cact[s] of war,\u201d and on the measure that\nauthorized the President\u2019s deployment of military force\u2014the AUMF.\nBecause we do not question the Government\u2019s position that the war\ncommenced with the events of September 11, 2001, the Prize Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Black</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1863) (cited post, at 2, 7, 8, and 10 (THOMAS, J., dissenting)),\n36                    HAMDAN v.

None of the overt acts that Hamdan is\nalleged to have committed violates the law of war.\n  These facts alone cast doubt on the legality of the charge\nand, hence, the commission; as Winthrop makes plain, the\noffense alleged must have been committed both in a thea\nter of war and during, not before, the relevant conflict.\nBut the deficiencies in the time and place allegations also\nunderscore\u2014indeed are symptomatic of\u2014the most serious\ndefect of this charge: The offense it alleges is not triable by\nlaw-of-war military commission. See Yamashita, 327 U. S.,\nat 13 (\u201cNeither congressional action nor the military or\nders constituting the commission authorized it to place\npetitioner on trial unless the charge proffered against him\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nare not germane to the analysis.\n   Finally, JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019 assertion that Julius Otto Kuehn\u2019s trial by\nmilitary commission \u201cfor conspiring with Japanese officials to betray\nthe United States fleet to the Imperial Japanese Government prior to\nits attack on Pearl Harbor\u201d stands as authoritative precedent for\nHamdan\u2019s trial by commission, post, at 9, misses the mark in three\ncritical respects. First, Kuehn was tried for the federal espionage\ncrimes under what were then 50 U. S C. \u00a7\u00a731, 32, and 34, not with\ncommon-law violations of the law of war. See Hearings before the Joint\nCommittee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, 79th Cong.,\n1st Sess., pt. 30, pp. 3067\u20133069 (1946). Second, he was tried by martial\nlaw commission (a kind of commission JUSTICE THOMAS acknowledges is\nnot relevant to the analysis here, and whose jurisdiction extends to\noffenses committed within \u201cthe exercise of . . . martial law,\u201d Winthrop\n837, see supra, n. 28), not a commission established exclusively to try\nviolations of the law of war. See ibid. Third, the martial law commis\nsions established to try crimes in Hawaii were ultimately declared\nillegal by this Court. See Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 327 U. S. 304, 324\n(1946) (\u201cThe phrase \u2018martial law\u2019 as employed in [the Hawaiian Organic\nAct], while intended to authorize the military to act vigorously for the\nmaintenance of an orderly civil government and for the defense of the\nIslands against actual or threatened rebellion or invasion, was not in\ntended to authorize the supplanting of courts by military tribunals\u201d).\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

See post, at 16\u201321, and n. 9. There\nare innumerable problems with this approach.\n   First, the crimes JUSTICE THOMAS identifies were not actually\ncharged. It is one thing to observe that charges before a military\ncommission \u201c \u2018need not be stated with the precision of a common law\nindictment,\u2019 \u201d post, at 15, n. 7 (citation omitted); it is quite another to\nsay that a crime not charged may nonetheless be read into an indict\nment. Second, the Government plainly had available to it the tools and\nthe time it needed to charge petitioner with the various crimes JUSTICE\nTHOMAS refers to, if it believed they were supported by the allegations.\nAs JUSTICE THOMAS himself observes, see post, at 21, the crime of aiding\nthe enemy may, in circumstances where the accused owes allegiance to\nthe party whose enemy he is alleged to have aided, be triable by mili\ntary commission pursuant to Article 104 of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. \u00a7904.\nIndeed, the Government has charged detainees under this provision\nwhen it has seen fit to do so. See Brief for David Hicks as Amicus\nCuriae 7.\n   Third, the cases JUSTICE THOMAS relies on to show that Hamdan may\nbe guilty of violations of the law of war not actually charged do not\nsupport his argument. JUSTICE THOMAS begins by blurring the distinc\ntion between those categories of \u201coffender\u201d who may be tried by military\ncommission (e.g., jayhawkers and the like) with the \u201coffenses\u201d that may\nbe so tried. Even when it comes to \u201c \u2018being a guerilla,\u2019 \u201d cf. post, at 18,\nn. 9 (citation omitted), a label alone does not render a person suscepti\nble to execution or other criminal punishment; the charge of \u201c \u2018being a\nguerilla\u2019 \u201d invariably is accompanied by the allegation that the defen\ndant \u201c \u2018took up arms\u2019 \u201d as such. This is because, as explained by Judge\nAdvocate General Holt in a decision upholding the charge of \u201c \u2018being a\nguerilla\u2019 \u201d as one recognized by \u201cthe universal usage of the times,\u201d the\ncharge is simply shorthand (akin to \u201cbeing a spy\u201d) for \u201cthe perpetration\nof a succession of similar acts\u201d of violence. Record Books of the Judge\nAdvocate General Office, R. 3, 590.         The sources cited by JUSTICE\nTHOMAS confirm as much. See cases cited post, at 18, n. 9.\n   Likewise, the suggestion that the Nuremberg precedents support\nHamdan\u2019s conviction for the (uncharged) crime of joining a criminal\norganization must fail. Cf. post, at 19\u201321. The convictions of certain\nhigh-level Nazi officials for \u201cmembership in a criminal organization\u201d\n38                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n   There is no suggestion that Congress has, in exercise of\nits constitutional authority to \u201cdefine and punish . . .\nOffences against the Law of Nations,\u201d U. S. Const., Art. I,\n\u00a78, cl. 10, positively identified \u201cconspiracy\u201d as a war\ncrime.33 As we explained in Quirin, that is not necessarily\nfatal to the Government\u2019s claim of authority to try the\nalleged offense by military commission; Congress, through\nArticle 21 of the UCMJ, has \u201cincorporated by reference\u201d\nthe common law of war, which may render triable by\nmilitary commission certain offenses not defined by stat\nute. 317 U. S., at 30. When, however, neither the ele\nments of the offense nor the range of permissible punish\nments is defined by statute or treaty, the precedent must\nbe plain and unambiguous. To demand any less would be\nto risk concentrating in military hands a degree of adjudi\ncative and punitive power in excess of that contemplated\neither by statute or by the Constitution. Cf. Loving v.\nUnited States, 517 U. S. 748, 771 (1996) (acknowledging\nthat Congress \u201cmay not delegate the power to make laws\u201d);\nReid, 354 U.

S., at 30; see id., at\n35\u201336 (\u201cThis precept of the law of war has been so recog\nnized in practice both here and abroad, and has so gener\nally been accepted as valid by authorities on international\nlaw that we think it must be regarded as a rule or princi\nple of the law of war recognized by this Government by its\nenactment of the Fifteenth Article of War\u201d (footnote omit\nted)). Although the picture arguably was less clear in\nYamashita, compare 327 U. S., at 16 (stating that the\nprovisions of the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, 36\nStat. 2306, \u201cplainly\u201d required the defendant to control the\ntroops under his command), with 327 U.

See, e.g., R. v. Rimmington, [2006] 2 All E. R. 257, 275\u2013279\n(House of Lords); id., at 279 (while \u201csome degree of vagueness is inevi\ntable and development of the law is a recognised feature of common law\ncourts, . . . the law-making function of the courts must remain within\nreasonable limits\u201d); see also Rogers v. Tennessee, 532 U. S. 451, 472\u2013\n478 (2001) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). The caution that must be exercised\nin the incremental development of common-law crimes by the judiciary\nis, for the reasons explained in the text, all the more critical when\nreviewing developments that stem from military action.\n40                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\ndefendant by military commission is acknowledged to be\nan offense against the law of war. That burden is far from\nsatisfied here. The crime of \u201cconspiracy\u201d has rarely if ever\nbeen tried as such in this country by any law-of-war mili\ntary commission not exercising some other form of juris\ndiction,35 and does not appear in either the Geneva Con\nventions or the Hague Conventions\u2014the major treaties on\nthe law of war.36 Winthrop explains that under the com\nmon law governing military commissions, it is not enough\nto intend to violate the law of war and commit overt acts\nin furtherance of that intention unless the overt acts\neither are themselves offenses against the law of war or\nconstitute steps sufficiently substantial to qualify as an\nattempt. See Winthrop 841 (\u201c[T]he jurisdiction of the\nmilitary commission should be restricted to cases of of\nfence consisting in overt acts, i.e., in unlawful commissions\nor actual attempts to commit, and not in intentions\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   35 The 19th-century trial of the \u201cLincoln conspirators,\u201d even if prop\n\nerly classified as a trial by law-of-war commission, cf. W. Rehnquist, All\nthe Laws But One: Civil Liberties in Wartime 165\u2013167 (1998) (analyz\ning the conspiracy charges in light of ordinary criminal law principles\nat the time), is at best an equivocal exception. Although the charge\nagainst the defendants in that case accused them of \u201ccombining, con\nfederating, and conspiring together\u201d to murder the President, they were\nalso charged (as we read the indictment, cf. post, at 23, n. 14 (THOMAS,\nJ., dissenting)) with \u201cmaliciously, unlawfully, and traitorously murder\ning the said Abraham Lincoln.\u201d H. R. Doc. No. 314, 55th Cong., 1st\nSess., 696 (1899). Moreover, the Attorney General who wrote the\nopinion defending the trial by military commission treated the charge\nas if it alleged the substantive offense of assassination. See 11 Op.\nAtty. Gen. 297 (1865) (analyzing the propriety of trying by military\ncommission \u201cthe offence of having assassinated the President\u201d); see also\nMudd v.

S. T., at 3418, and this Court has\nread the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907 to impose \u201ccommand\nresponsibility\u201d on military commanders for acts of their subordinates,\nsee Yamshita, 327 U.

First, it points out that the Nazi saboteurs in\nQuirin were charged with conspiracy. See Brief for Re\nspondents 27. Second, it observes that Winthrop at one\npoint in his treatise identifies conspiracy as an offense\n\u201cprosecuted by military commissions.\u201d Ibid. (citing Win\nthrop 839, and n. 5). Finally, it notes that another mili\ntary historian, Charles Roscoe Howland, lists conspiracy\n\u201c \u2018to violate the laws of war by destroying life or property\nin aid of the enemy\u2019 \u201d as an offense that was tried as a\nviolation of the law of war during the Civil War. Brief for\nRespondents 27\u201328 (citing C. Howland, Digest of Opinions\nof the Judge Advocates General of the Army 1071 (1912)\n(hereinafter Howland)). On close analysis, however, these\nsources at best lend little support to the Government\u2019s\nposition and at worst undermine it. By any measure, they\nfail to satisfy the high standard of clarity required to\njustify the use of a military commission.\n    That the defendants in Quirin were charged with con\nspiracy is not persuasive, since the Court declined to\naddress whether the offense actually qualified as a viola\ntion of the law of war\u2014let alone one triable by military\ncommission. The Quirin defendants were charged with\nthe following offenses:\n    \u201c[I.] Violation of the law of war. \n\n    \u201c[II.] Violation of Article 81 of the Articles of War, de\n\n    fining the offense of relieving or attempting to relieve, \n\n    or corresponding with or giving intelligence to, the\n\n    enemy.\n\n    \u201c[III.] Violation of Article 82, defining the offense of\n\n    spying.\n\n    \u201c[IV.] Conspiracy to commit the offenses alleged in\n\n    charges [I, II, and III].\u201d 317 U. S., at 23. \n\nThe Government, defending its charge, argued that the\n42                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nconspiracy alleged \u201cconstitute[d] an additional violation of\nthe law of war.\u201d Id., at 15. The saboteurs disagreed; they\nmaintained that \u201c[t]he charge of conspiracy can not stand\nif the other charges fall.\u201d Id., at 8. The Court, however,\ndeclined to resolve the dispute. It concluded, first, that\nthe specification supporting Charge I adequately alleged a\n\u201cviolation of the law of war\u201d that was not \u201cmerely colorable\nor without foundation.\u201d Id., at 36. The facts the Court\ndeemed sufficient for this purpose were that the defen\ndants, admitted enemy combatants, entered upon U. S.\nterritory in time of war without uniform \u201cfor the purpose\nof destroying property used or useful in prosecuting the\nwar.\u201d That act was \u201ca hostile and warlike\u201d one. Id., at 36,\n37. The Court was careful in its decision to identify an\novert, \u201ccomplete\u201d act. Responding to the argument that\nthe saboteurs had \u201cnot actually committed or attempted to\ncommit any act of depredation or entered the theatre or\nzone of active military operations\u201d and therefore had not\nviolated the law of war, the Court responded that they had\nactually \u201cpassed our military and naval lines and defenses\nor went behind those lines, in civilian dress and with\nhostile purpose.\u201d Id., at 38. \u201cThe offense was complete\nwhen with that purpose they entered\u2014or, having so en\ntered, they remained upon\u2014our territory in time of war\nwithout uniform or other appropriate means of identifica\ntion.\u201d Ibid.\n   Turning to the other charges alleged, the Court ex\nplained that \u201c[s]ince the first specification of Charge I sets\nforth a violation of the law of war, we have no occasion to\npass on the adequacy of the second specification of Charge\nI, or to construe the 81st and 82nd Articles of War for the\npurpose of ascertaining whether the specifications under\nCharges II and III allege violations of those Articles or\nwhether if so construed they are constitutional.\u201d Id., at\n46. No mention was made at all of Charge IV\u2014the con\nspiracy charge.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           43\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n  If anything, Quirin supports Hamdan\u2019s argument that\nconspiracy is not a violation of the law of war. Not only\ndid the Court pointedly omit any discussion of the con\nspiracy charge, but its analysis of Charge I placed special\nemphasis on the completion of an offense; it took seriously\nthe saboteurs\u2019 argument that there can be no violation of a\nlaw of war\u2014at least not one triable by military commis\nsion\u2014without the actual commission of or attempt to\ncommit a \u201chostile and warlike act.\u201d Id., at 37\u201338.\n  That limitation makes eminent sense when one consid\ners the necessity from whence this kind of military com\nmission grew: The need to dispense swift justice, often in\nthe form of execution, to illegal belligerents captured on\nthe battlefield. See S. Rep. No. 130, 64th Cong., 1st Sess.,\np. 40 (1916) (testimony of Brig. Gen. Enoch H. Crowder)\n(observing that Article of War 15 preserves the power of\n\u201cthe military commander in the field in time of war\u201d to use\nmilitary commissions (emphasis added)). The same ur\ngency would not have been felt vis-\u00e0-vis enemies who had\ndone little more than agree to violate the laws of war. Cf.\n31 Op. Atty. Gen. 356, 357, 361 (1918) (opining that a\nGerman spy could not be tried by military commission\nbecause, having been apprehended before entering \u201cany\ncamp, fortification or other military premises of the\nUnited States,\u201d he had \u201ccommitted [his offenses] outside of\nthe field of military operations\u201d). The Quirin Court ac\nknowledged as much when it described the President\u2019s\nauthority to use law-of-war military commissions as the\npower to \u201cseize and subject to disciplinary measures those\nenemies who in their attempt to thwart or impede our\nmilitary effort have violated the law of war.\u201d 317 U. S., at\n28\u201329 (emphasis added).\n  Winthrop and Howland are only superficially more\nhelpful to the Government. Howland, granted, lists \u201ccon\nspiracy by two or more to violate the laws of war by de\nstroying life or property in aid of the enemy\u201d as one of over\n44                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n20 \u201coffenses against the laws and usages of war\u201d \u201cpassed\nupon and punished by military commissions.\u201d Howland\n1071. But while the records of cases that Howland cites\nfollowing his list of offenses against the law of war support\ninclusion of the other offenses mentioned, they provide no\nsupport for the inclusion of conspiracy as a violation of the\nlaw of war. See ibid. (citing Record Books of the Judge\nAdvocate General Office, R. 2, 144; R. 3, 401, 589, 649; R.\n4, 320; R. 5, 36, 590; R. 6, 20; R. 7, 413; R. 8, 529; R. 9,\n149, 202, 225, 481, 524, 535; R. 10, 567; R. 11, 473, 513; R.\n13, 125, 675; R. 16, 446; R. 21, 101, 280). Winthrop, ap\nparently recognizing as much, excludes conspiracy of any\nkind from his own list of offenses against the law of war.\nSee Winthrop 839\u2013840.\n   Winthrop does, unsurprisingly, include \u201ccriminal con\nspiracies\u201d in his list of \u201c[c]rimes and statutory offenses\ncognizable by State or U. S. courts\u201d and triable by martial\nlaw or military government commission. See id., at 839.\nAnd, in a footnote, he cites several Civil War examples of\n\u201cconspiracies of this class, or of the first and second classes\ncombined.\u201d Id., at 839, n. 5 (emphasis added). The Gov\nernment relies on this footnote for its contention that\nconspiracy was triable both as an ordinary crime (a crime\nof the \u201cfirst class\u201d) and, independently, as a war crime (a\ncrime of the \u201csecond class\u201d). But the footnote will not\nsupport the weight the Government places on it.\n   As we have seen, the military commissions convened\nduring the Civil War functioned at once as martial law or\nmilitary government tribunals and as law-of-war commis\nsions. See n. 27, supra. Accordingly, they regularly tried\nwar crimes and ordinary crimes together. Indeed, as\nHowland observes, \u201c[n]ot infrequently the crime, as\ncharged and found, was a combination of the two species of\noffenses.\u201d Howland 1071; see also Davis 310, n. 2; Win\nthrop 842. The example he gives is \u201c \u2018murder in violation\nof the laws of war.\u2019 \u201d Howland 1071\u20131072. Winthrop\u2019s\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

It is not a stand-alone\noffense against the law of war. Winthrop confirms this\nunderstanding later in his discussion, when he empha\nsizes that \u201covert acts\u201d constituting war crimes are the only\nproper subject at least of those military tribunals not\nconvened to stand in for local courts. Winthrop 841, and\nnn. 22, 23 (emphasis in original) (citing W. Finlason,\nMartial Law 130 (1867)).\n   JUSTICE THOMAS cites as evidence that conspiracy is a\nrecognized violation of the law of war the Civil War in\ndictment against Henry Wirz, which charged the defen\ndant with \u201c \u2018[m]aliciously, willfully, and traitorously . . .\ncombining, confederating, and conspiring [with others] to\ninjure the health and destroy the lives of soldiers in the\nmilitary service of the United States . . . to the end that\nthe armies of the United States might be weakened and\nimpaired, in violation of the laws and customs of war.\u2019 \u201d\nPost, at 24\u201325 (dissenting opinion) (quoting H. R. Doc. No.\n314, 55th Cong., 3d Sess., 785 (1865); emphasis deleted).\nAs shown by the specification supporting that charge,\nhowever, Wirz was alleged to have personally committed a\nnumber of atrocities against his victims, including torture,\ninjection of prisoners with poison, and use of \u201cferocious\nand bloodthirsty dogs\u201d to \u201cseize, tear, mangle, and maim\nthe bodies and limbs\u201d of prisoners, many of whom died as\na result. Id., at 789\u2013790. Crucially, Judge Advocate\nGeneral Holt determined that one of Wirz\u2019s alleged co\nconspirators, R. B. Winder, should not be tried by military\ncommission because there was as yet insufficient evidence\nof his own personal involvement in the atrocities: \u201c[I]n the\ncase of R. B. Winder, while the evidence at the trial of Wirz\nwas deemed by the court to implicate him in the conspiracy\nagainst the lives of all Federal prisoners in rebel hands, no\n46                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nsuch specific overt acts of violation of the laws of war are\nas yet fixed upon him as to make it expedient to prefer\nformal charges and bring him to trial.\u201d Id., at 783 (em\nphases added).37\n  Finally, international sources confirm that the crime\ncharged here is not a recognized violation of the law of\nwar.38 As observed above, see supra, at 40, none of the\nmajor treaties governing the law of war identifies conspir\nacy as a violation thereof. And the only \u201cconspiracy\u201d\ncrimes that have been recognized by international war\ncrimes tribunals (whose jurisdiction often extends beyond\nwar crimes proper to crimes against humanity and crimes\nagainst the peace) are conspiracy to commit genocide and\ncommon plan to wage aggressive war, which is a crime\nagainst the peace and requires for its commission actual\nparticipation in a \u201cconcrete plan to wage war.\u201d 1 Trial of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   37 The other examples JUSTICE THOMAS offers are no more availing.\n\nThe Civil War indictment against Robert Louden, cited post, at 25,\nalleged a conspiracy, but not one in violation of the law of war. See War\nDept., General Court Martial Order No. 41, p. 20 (1864). A separate\ncharge of \u201c \u2018[t]ransgression of the laws and customs of war\u2019 \u201d made no\nmention of conspiracy. Id., at 17. The charge against Lenger Grenfel\nand others for conspiring to release rebel prisoners held in Chicago only\nsupports the observation, made in the text, that the Civil War tribunals\noften charged hybrid crimes mixing elements of crimes ordinarily\ntriable in civilian courts (like treason) and violations of the law of war.\nJudge Advocate General Holt, in recommending that Grenfel\u2019s death\nsentence be upheld (it was in fact commuted by Presidential decree, see\nH. R. Doc. No. 314, at 725), explained that the accused \u201cunited himself\nwith traitors and malefactors for the overthrow of our Republic in the\ninterest of slavery.\u201d Id., at 689.\n   38 The Court in Quirin \u201cassume[d] that there are acts regarded in\n\nother countries, or by some writers on international law, as offenses\nagainst the law of war which would not be triable by military tribunal\nhere, either because they are not recognized by our courts as violations\nof the law of war or because they are of that class of offenses constitu\ntionally triable only by a jury.\u201d 317 U. S., at 29. We need not test the\nvalidity of that assumption here because the international sources only\ncorroborate the domestic ones.\n                    Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                  47\n\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nthe Major War Criminals Before the International Mili\ntary Tribunal: Nuremberg, 14 November 1945\u20131 October\n1946, p. 225 (1947). The International Military Tribunal\nat Nuremberg, over the prosecution\u2019s objections, pointedly\nrefused to recognize as a violation of the law of war con\nspiracy to commit war crimes, see, e.g., 22 id., at 469,39\nand convicted only Hitler\u2019s most senior associates of con\nspiracy to wage aggressive war, see S. Pomorski, Conspir\nacy and Criminal Organization, in the Nuremberg Trial\nand International Law 213, 233\u2013235 (G. Ginsburgs & V.\nKudriavtsev eds. 1990). As one prominent figure from the\nNuremberg trials has explained, members of the Tribunal\nobjected to recognition of conspiracy as a violation of the\nlaw of war on the ground that \u201c[t]he Anglo-American\nconcept of conspiracy was not part of European legal\nsystems and arguably not an element of the internation\nally recognized laws of war.\u201d T. Taylor, Anatomy of the\nNuremberg Trials: A Personal Memoir 36 (1992); see also\nid., at 550 (observing that Francis Biddle, who as Attorney\nGeneral prosecuted the defendants in Quirin, thought the\nFrench judge had made a \u201c \u2018persuasive argument that\nconspiracy in the truest sense is not known to interna\ntional law\u2019 \u201d).40\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  39 Accordingly,    the Tribunal determined to \u201cdisregard the\ncharges . . . that the defendants conspired to commit War Crimes and\nCrimes against Humanity.\u201d 22 Trial of the Major War Criminals\nBefore the International Military Tribunal 469 (1947); see also ibid.\n(\u201c[T]he Charter does not define as a separate crime any conspiracy\nexcept the one to commit acts of aggressive war\u201d).\n   40 See also 15 United Nations War Crimes Commissions, Law Reports\n\nof Trials of War Criminals 90\u201391 (1949) (observing that, although a few\nindividuals were charged with conspiracy under European domestic\ncriminal codes following World War II, \u201cthe United States Military\nTribunals\u201d established at that time did not \u201crecognis[e] as a separate\noffence conspiracy to commit war crimes or crimes against humanity\u201d).\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY),\ndrawing on the Nuremberg precedents, has adopted a \u201cjoint criminal\n48                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n   In sum, the sources that the Government and JUSTICE\nTHOMAS rely upon to show that conspiracy to violate the\nlaw of war is itself a violation of the law of war in fact\ndemonstrate quite the opposite. Far from making the\nrequisite substantial showing, the Government has failed\neven to offer a \u201cmerely colorable\u201d case for inclusion of\nconspiracy among those offenses cognizable by law-of-war\nmilitary commission. Cf. Quirin, 317 U. S., at 36. Be\ncause the charge does not support the commission\u2019s juris\ndiction, the commission lacks authority to try Hamdan.\n   The charge\u2019s shortcomings are not merely formal, but\nare indicative of a broader inability on the Executive\u2019s part\nhere to satisfy the most basic precondition\u2014at least in the\nabsence of specific congressional authorization\u2014for estab\nlishment of military commissions: military necessity.\nHamdan\u2019s tribunal was appointed not by a military com\nmander in the field of battle, but by a retired major gen\neral stationed away from any active hostilities. Cf. Rasul\nv. Bush, 542 U. S., at 487 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in\njudgment) (observing that \u201cGuantanamo Bay is . . . far\nremoved from any hostilities\u201d). Hamdan is charged not\nwith an overt act for which he was caught redhanded in a\ntheater of war and which military efficiency demands be\ntried expeditiously, but with an agreement the inception of\nwhich long predated the attacks of September 11, 2001\nand the AUMF. That may well be a crime,41 but it is not\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nenterprise\u201d theory of liability, but that is a species of liability for the\nsubstantive offense (akin to aiding and abetting), not a crime on its\nown. See Prosecutor v. Tadi\u0107, Judgment, Case No. IT\u201394\u20131\u2013A (ICTY\nApp. Chamber, July 15, 1999); see also Prosecutor v.

None of the\novert acts alleged to have been committed in furtherance\nof the agreement is itself a war crime, or even necessarily\noccurred during time of, or in a theater of, war. Any ur\ngent need for imposition or execution of judgment is ut\nterly belied by the record; Hamdan was arrested in No\nvember 2001 and he was not charged until mid-2004.\nThese simply are not the circumstances in which, by any\nstretch of the historical evidence or this Court\u2019s prece\ndents, a military commission established by Executive\nOrder under the authority of Article 21 of the UCMJ may\nlawfully try a person and subject him to punishment.\n                              VI\n   Whether or not the Government has charged Hamdan\nwith an offense against the law of war cognizable by mili\ntary commission, the commission lacks power to proceed.\nThe UCMJ conditions the President\u2019s use of military\ncommissions on compliance not only with the American\ncommon law of war, but also with the rest of the UCMJ\nitself, insofar as applicable, and with the \u201crules and pre\ncepts of the law of nations,\u201d Quirin, 317 U. S., at 28\u2014\nincluding, inter alia, the four Geneva Conventions signed\nin 1949. See Yamashita, 327 U. S., at 20\u201321, 23\u201324. The\nprocedures that the Government has decreed will govern\nHamdan\u2019s trial by commission violate these laws.\n                          A\n  The commission\u2019s procedures are set forth in Commis\nsion Order No. 1, which was amended most recently on\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nterrorism is therefore wide of the mark. See post, at 8, n. 3; 28\u201330.\n\nThat conspiracy is not a violation of the law of war triable by military\n\ncommission does not mean the Government may not, for example,\n\nprosecute by court-martial or in federal court those caught \u201cplotting\n\nterrorist atrocities like the bombing of the Khobar Towers.\u201d Post, at 29. \n\n50                   HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nAugust 31, 2005\u2014after Hamdan\u2019s trial had already begun.\nEvery commission established pursuant to Commission\nOrder No. 1 must have a presiding officer and at least\nthree other members, all of whom must be commissioned\nofficers. \u00a74(A)(1). The presiding officer\u2019s job is to rule on\nquestions of law and other evidentiary and interlocutory\nissues; the other members make findings and, if applica\nble, sentencing decisions. \u00a74(A)(5). The accused is enti\ntled to appointed military counsel and may hire civilian\ncounsel at his own expense so long as such counsel is a\nU. S. citizen with security clearance \u201cat the level SECRET\nor higher.\u201d \u00a7\u00a74(C)(2)\u2013(3).\n   The accused also is entitled to a copy of the charge(s)\nagainst him, both in English and his own language (if\ndifferent), to a presumption of innocence, and to certain\nother rights typically afforded criminal defendants in\ncivilian courts and courts-martial. See \u00a7\u00a75(A)\u2013(P). These\nrights are subject, however, to one glaring condition: The\naccused and his civilian counsel may be excluded from,\nand precluded from ever learning what evidence was\npresented during, any part of the proceeding that either\nthe Appointing Authority or the presiding officer decides\nto \u201cclose.\u201d Grounds for such closure \u201cinclude the protec\ntion of information classified or classifiable . . . ; informa\ntion protected by law or rule from unauthorized disclosure;\nthe physical safety of participants in Commission proceed\nings, including prospective witnesses; intelligence and law\nenforcement sources, methods, or activities; and other\nnational security interests.\u201d \u00a76(B)(3).42 Appointed mili\ntary defense counsel must be privy to these closed ses\nsions, but may, at the presiding officer\u2019s discretion, be\nforbidden to reveal to his or her client what took place\ntherein. Ibid.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  42 The accused also may be excluded from the proceedings if he \u201cen\n\ngages in disruptive conduct.\u201d \u00a75(K).\n                    Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                  51\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  Another striking feature of the rules governing Ham\ndan\u2019s commission is that they permit the admission of any\nevidence that, in the opinion of the presiding officer,\n\u201cwould have probative value to a reasonable person.\u201d\n\u00a76(D)(1). Under this test, not only is testimonial hearsay\nand evidence obtained through coercion fully admissible,\nbut neither live testimony nor witnesses\u2019 written state\nments need be sworn. See \u00a7\u00a76(D)(2)(b), (3). Moreover, the\naccused and his civilian counsel may be denied access to\nevidence in the form of \u201cprotected information\u201d (which\nincludes classified information as well as \u201cinformation\nprotected by law or rule from unauthorized disclosure\u201d and\n\u201cinformation concerning other national security interests,\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a76(B)(3), 6(D)(5)(a)(v)), so long as the presiding officer\nconcludes that the evidence is \u201cprobative\u201d under \u00a76(D)(1)\nand that its admission without the accused\u2019s knowledge\nwould not \u201cresult in the denial of a full and fair trial.\u201d\n\u00a76(D)(5)(b).43 Finally, a presiding officer\u2019s determination\nthat evidence \u201cwould not have probative value to a rea\nsonable person\u201d may be overridden by a majority of the\nother commission members. \u00a76(D)(1).\n  Once all the evidence is in, the commission members (not\nincluding the presiding officer) must vote on the accused\u2019s\nguilt. A two-thirds vote will suffice for both a verdict of\nguilty and for imposition of any sentence not including\ndeath (the imposition of which requires a unanimous vote).\n\u00a76(F). Any appeal is taken to a three-member review\npanel composed of military officers and designated by the\nSecretary of Defense, only one member of which need have\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  43 As the District Court observed, this section apparently permits\n\nreception of testimony from a confidential informant in circumstances\nwhere \u201cHamdan will not be permitted to hear the testimony, see the\nwitness\u2019s face, or learn his name. If the government has information\ndeveloped by interrogation of witnesses in Afghanistan or elsewhere, it\ncan offer such evidence in transcript form, or even as summaries of\ntranscripts.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2368563\"><a href=\"/opinion/2368563/hamdan-v-rumsfeld/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The review panel is\ndirected to \u201cdisregard any variance from procedures speci\nfied in this Order or elsewhere that would not materially\nhave affected the outcome of the trial before the Commis\nsion.\u201d Ibid. Once the panel makes its recommendation to\nthe Secretary of Defense, the Secretary can either remand\nfor further proceedings or forward the record to the Presi\ndent with his recommendation as to final disposition.\n\u00a76(H)(5). The President then, unless he has delegated the\ntask to the Secretary, makes the \u201cfinal decision.\u201d \u00a76(H)(6).\nHe may change the commission\u2019s findings or sentence only\nin a manner favorable to the accused. Ibid.\n                              B\n   Hamdan raises both general and particular objections to\nthe procedures set forth in Commission Order No. 1. His\ngeneral objection is that the procedures\u2019 admitted devia\ntion from those governing courts-martial itself renders the\ncommission illegal. Chief among his particular objections\nare that he may, under the Commission Order, be con\nvicted based on evidence he has not seen or heard, and\nthat any evidence admitted against him need not comply\nwith the admissibility or relevance rules typically applica\nble in criminal trials and court-martial proceedings.\n   The Government objects to our consideration of any\nprocedural challenge at this stage on the grounds that (1)\nthe abstention doctrine espoused in Councilman, 420 U. S.\n738, precludes pre-enforcement review of procedural rules,\n(2) Hamdan will be able to raise any such challenge follow\ning a \u201cfinal decision\u201d under the DTA, and (3) \u201cthere is . . .\nno basis to presume, before the trial has even commenced,\nthat the trial will not be conducted in good faith and ac\ncording to law.\u201d Brief for Respondents 45\u201346, nn. 20\u201321.\nThe first of these contentions was disposed of in Part III,\nsupra, and neither of the latter two is sound.\n   First, because Hamdan apparently is not subject to the\n                    Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                 53\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ndeath penalty (at least as matters now stand) and may\nreceive a sentence shorter than 10 years\u2019 imprisonment,\nhe has no automatic right to review of the commission\u2019s\n\u201cfinal decision\u201d44 before a federal court under the DTA.\nSee \u00a71005(e)(3), 119 Stat. 2743. Second, contrary to the\nGovernment\u2019s assertion, there is a \u201cbasis to presume\u201d that\nthe procedures employed during Hamdan\u2019s trial will vio\nlate the law: The procedures are described with particular\nity in Commission Order No. 1, and implementation of\nsome of them has already occurred. One of Hamdan\u2019s\ncomplaints is that he will be, and indeed already has been,\nexcluded from his own trial. See Reply Brief for Petitioner\n12; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a. Under these circumstances,\nreview of the procedures in advance of a \u201cfinal decision\u201d\u2014\nthe timing of which is left entirely to the discretion of the\nPresident under the DTA\u2014is appropriate. We turn, then,\nto consider the merits of Hamdan\u2019s procedural challenge.\n                              C\n  In part because the difference between military commis\nsions and courts-martial originally was a difference of\njurisdiction alone, and in part to protect against abuse and\nensure evenhandedness under the pressures of war, the\nprocedures governing trials by military commission his\ntorically have been the same as those governing courts-\nmartial. See, e.g., 1 The War of the Rebellion 248 (2d\nseries 1894) (General Order 1 issued during the Civil War\nrequired military commissions to \u201cbe constituted in a\nsimilar manner and their proceedings be conducted ac\ncording to the same general rules as courts-martial in\norder to prevent abuses which might otherwise arise\u201d).\nAccounts of commentators from Winthrop through Gen\neral Crowder\u2014who drafted Article of War 15 and whose\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  44 Any decision of the commission is not \u201cfinal\u201d until the President\n\nrenders it so. See Commission Order No. 1 \u00a76(H)(6).\n54                    HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nviews have been deemed \u201cauthoritative\u201d by this Court,\nMadsen, 343 U. S., at 353\u2014confirm as much.45 As re\ncently as the Korean and Vietnam wars, during which use\nof military commissions was contemplated but never\nmade, the principle of procedural parity was espoused as a\nbackground assumption. See Paust, Antiterrorism Mili\ntary Commissions: Courting Illegality, 23 Mich. J. Int\u2019l L.\n1, 3\u20135 (2001\u20132002).\n   There is a glaring historical exception to this general\nrule. The procedures and evidentiary rules used to try\nGeneral Yamashita near the end of World War II deviated\nin significant respects from those then governing courts-\nmartial. See 327 U. S. 1. The force of that precedent,\nhowever, has been seriously undermined by post-World\nWar II developments.\n   Yamashita, from late 1944 until September 1945, was\nCommanding General of the Fourteenth Army Group of\nthe Imperial Japanese Army, which had exercised control\nover the Philippine Islands. On September 3, 1945, after\nAmerican forces regained control of the Philippines, Ya\nmashita surrendered. Three weeks later, he was charged\nwith violations of the law of war. A few weeks after that,\nhe was arraigned before a military commission convened\nin the Philippines. He pleaded not guilty, and his trial\nlasted for two months. On December 7, 1945, Yamashita\nwas convicted and sentenced to hang. See id., at 5; id., at\n31\u201334 (Murphy, J., dissenting).

See\nid., at 41\u201381 (Rutledge, J., joined by Murphy, J., dissent\ning).46 Among the dissenters\u2019 primary concerns was that\nthe commission had free rein to consider all evidence\n\u201cwhich in the commission\u2019s opinion \u2018would be of assistance\nin proving or disproving the charge,\u2019 without any of the\nusual modes of authentication.\u201d Id., at 49 (Rutledge, J.).\n  The majority, however, did not pass on the merits of\nYamashita\u2019s procedural challenges because it concluded\nthat his status disentitled him to any protection under the\nArticles of War (specifically, those set forth in Article 38,\nwhich would become Article 36 of the UCMJ) or the Ge\nneva Convention of 1929, 47 Stat. 2021 (1929 Geneva\nConvention). The Court explained that Yamashita was\nneither a \u201cperson made subject to the Articles of War by\nArticle 2\u201d thereof, 327 U. S., at 20, nor a protected pris\noner of war being tried for crimes committed during his\ndetention, id., at 21.\n  At least partially in response to subsequent criticism of\nGeneral Yamashita\u2019s trial, the UCMJ\u2019s codification of the\nArticles of War after World War II expanded the category\nof persons subject thereto to include defendants in Yama\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  46 The  dissenters\u2019 views are summarized in the following passage:\n   \u201cIt is outside our basic scheme to condemn men without giving\nreasonable opportunity for preparing defense; in capital or other\nserious crimes to convict on \u2018official documents . . .; affidavits; . . .\ndocuments or translations thereof; diaries . . ., photographs, motion\npicture films, and . . . newspapers\u201d or on hearsay, once, twice or thrice\nremoved, more particularly when the documentary evidence or some of\nit is prepared ex parte by the prosecuting authority and includes not\nonly opinion but conclusions of guilt. Nor in such cases do we deny the\nrights of confrontation of witnesses and cross-examination.\u201d Yama\nshita, 327 U. S., at 44 (footnotes omitted).\n56                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nshita\u2019s (and Hamdan\u2019s) position,47 and the Third Geneva\nConvention of 1949 extended prisoner-of-war protections\nto individuals tried for crimes committed before their\ncapture. See 3 Int\u2019l Comm. of Red Cross,48 Commentary:\nGeneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners\nof War 413 (1960) (hereinafter GCIII Commentary) (ex\nplaining that Article 85, which extends the Convention\u2019s\nprotections to \u201c[p]risoners of war prosecuted under the\nlaws of the Detaining Power for acts committed prior to\ncapture,\u201d was adopted in response to judicial interpreta\ntions of the 1929 Convention, including this Court\u2019s deci\nsion in Yamashita). The most notorious exception to the\nprinciple of uniformity, then, has been stripped of its\nprecedential value.\n   The uniformity principle is not an inflexible one; it does\nnot preclude all departures from the procedures dictated\nfor use by courts-martial. But any departure must be\ntailored to the exigency that necessitates it. See Winthrop\n835, n. 81. That understanding is reflected in Article 36 of\nthe UCMJ, which provides:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  47 Article2 of the UCMJ now reads:\n  \u201c(a) The following persons are subject to [the UCMJ]:\n  \u201c(9) Prisoners of war in custody of the armed forces.\n   \u201c(12) Subject to any treaty or agreement to which the United States is\nor may be a party or to any accepted rule of international law, persons\nwithin an area leased by or otherwise reserved or acquired for the use\nof the United States which is under the control of the Secretary con\ncerned and which is outside the United States and outside the Com\nmonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands.\u201d 10 U.

First, no procedural rule\nhe adopts may be \u201ccontrary to or inconsistent with\u201d the\nUCMJ\u2014however practical it may seem. Second, the rules\nadopted must be \u201cuniform insofar as practicable.\u201d That is,\nthe rules applied to military commissions must be the\nsame as those applied to courts-martial unless such uni\nformity proves impracticable.\n  Hamdan argues that Commission Order No. 1 violates\nboth of these restrictions; he maintains that the proce\ndures described in the Commission Order are inconsistent\nwith the UCMJ and that the Government has offered no\nexplanation for their deviation from the procedures gov\nerning courts-martial, which are set forth in the Manual\nfor Courts-Martial, United States (2005 ed.) (Manual for\nCourts-Martial).    Among the inconsistencies Hamdan\nidentifies is that between \u00a76 of the Commission Order,\nwhich permits exclusion of the accused from proceedings\nand denial of his access to evidence in certain circum\nstances, and the UCMJ\u2019s requirement that \u201c[a]ll . . . pro\nceedings\u201d other than votes and deliberations by courts-\nmartial \u201cshall be made a part of the record and shall be in\n58                     HAMDAN v.

Hamdan also observes that the Commission Order\ndispenses with virtually all evidentiary rules applicable in\ncourts-martial.\n  The Government has three responses. First, it argues,\nonly 9 of the UCMJ\u2019s 158 Articles\u2014the ones that expressly\nmention \u201cmilitary commissions\u201d49\u2014actually apply to com\nmissions, and Commission Order No. 1 sets forth no pro\ncedure that is \u201ccontrary to or inconsistent with\u201d those 9\nprovisions. Second, the Government contends, military\ncommissions would be of no use if the President were\nhamstrung by those provisions of the UCMJ that govern\ncourts-martial. Finally, the President\u2019s determination\nthat \u201cthe danger to the safety of the United States and the\nnature of international terrorism\u201d renders it impracticable\n\u201cto apply in military commissions . . . the principles of law\nand rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of\ncriminal cases in the United States district courts,\u201d No\nvember 13 Order \u00a71(f), is, in the Government\u2019s view, ex\nplanation enough for any deviation from court-martial\nprocedures. See Brief for Respondents 43\u201347, and n. 22.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  49 Aside from Articles 21 and 36, discussed at length in the text, the\n\nother seven Articles that expressly reference military commissions are:\n(1) 28 (requiring appointment of reporters and interpreters); (2) 47\n(making it a crime to refuse to appear or testify \u201cbefore a court-martial,\nmilitary commission, court of inquiry, or any other military court or\nboard\u201d); (3) 48 (allowing a \u201ccourt-martial, provost court, or military\ncommission\u201d to punish a person for contempt); (4) 49(d) (permitting\nadmission into evidence of a \u201cduly authenticated deposition taken upon\nreasonable notice to the other parties\u201d only if \u201cadmissible under the\nrules of evidence\u201d and only if the witness is otherwise unavailable); (5)\n50 (permitting admission into evidence of records of courts of inquiry \u201cif\notherwise admissible under the rules of evidence,\u201d and if certain other\nrequirements are met); (6) 104 (providing that a person accused of\naiding the enemy may be sentenced to death or other punishment by\nmilitary commission or court-martial); and (7) 106 (mandating the\ndeath penalty for spies convicted before military commission or court-\nmartial).\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                    59\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Hamdan has the better of this argument. Without\nreaching the question whether any provision of Commis\nsion Order No. 1 is strictly \u201ccontrary to or inconsistent\nwith\u201d other provisions of the UCMJ, we conclude that the\n\u201cpracticability\u201d determination the President has made is\ninsufficient to justify variances from the procedures gov\nerning courts-martial. Subsection (b) of Article 36 was\nadded after World War II, and requires a different show\ning of impracticability from the one required by subsection\n(a). Subsection (a) requires that the rules the President\npromulgates for courts-martial, provost courts, and mili\ntary commissions alike conform to those that govern pro\ncedures in Article III courts, \u201cso far as he considers practi\ncable.\u201d 10 U. S. C. \u00a7836(a) (emphasis added). Subsection\n(b), by contrast, demands that the rules applied in courts-\nmartial, provost courts, and military commissions\u2014\nwhether or not they conform with the Federal Rules of\nEvidence\u2014be \u201cuniform insofar as practicable.\u201d \u00a7836(b)\n(emphasis added). Under the latter provision, then, the\nrules set forth in the Manual for Courts-Martial must\napply to military commissions unless impracticable.50\n   The President here has determined, pursuant to subsec\ntion (a), that it is impracticable to apply the rules and\nprinciples of law that govern \u201cthe trial of criminal cases in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   50 JUSTICE THOMAS relies on the legislative history of the UCMJ to\n\nargue that Congress\u2019 adoption of Article 36(b) in the wake of World War\nII was \u201cmotivated\u201d solely by a desire for \u201cuniformity across the separate\nbranches of the armed services.\u201d Post, at 35. But even if Congress was\nconcerned with ensuring uniformity across service branches, that does\nnot mean it did not also intend to codify the longstanding practice of\nprocedural parity between courts-martial and other military tribunals.\nIndeed, the suggestion that Congress did not intend uniformity across\ntribunal types is belied by the textual proximity of subsection (a) (which\nrequires that the rules governing criminal trials in federal district\ncourts apply, absent the President\u2019s determination of impracticability,\nto courts-martial, provost courts, and military commissions alike) and\nsubsection (b) (which imposes the uniformity requirement).\n60                    HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe United States district courts,\u201d \u00a7836(a), to Hamdan\u2019s\ncommission. We assume that complete deference is owed\nthat determination. The President has not, however,\nmade a similar official determination that it is impractica\nble to apply the rules for courts-martial.51 And even if\nsubsection (b)\u2019s requirements may be satisfied without\nsuch an official determination, the requirements of that\nsubsection are not satisfied here.\n  Nothing in the record before us demonstrates that it\nwould be impracticable to apply court-martial rules in this\ncase. There is no suggestion, for example, of any logistical\ndifficulty in securing properly sworn and authenticated\nevidence or in applying the usual principles of relevance\nand admissibility. Assuming arguendo that the reasons\narticulated in the President\u2019s Article 36(a) determination\nought to be considered in evaluating the impracticability\nof applying court-martial rules, the only reason offered in\nsupport of that determination is the danger posed by\ninternational terrorism.52 Without for one moment under\nestimating that danger, it is not evident to us why it\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  51 We  may assume that such a determination would be entitled to a\nmeasure of deference. For the reasons given by JUSTICE KENNEDY, see\npost, at 5 (opinion concurring in part), however, the level of deference\naccorded to a determination made under subsection (b) presum\nably would not be as high as that accorded to a determination under\nsubsection (a).\n  52 JUSTICE THOMAS looks not to the President\u2019s official Article 36(a)\n\ndetermination, but instead to press statements made by the Secretary\nof Defense and the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. See post, at\n36\u201338 (dissenting opinion). We have not heretofore, in evaluating the\nlegality of Executive action, deferred to comments made by such offi\ncials to the media. Moreover, the only additional reason the comments\nprovide\u2014aside from the general danger posed by international terror\nism\u2014for departures from court-martial procedures is the need to\nprotect classified information. As we explain in the text, and as\nJUSTICE KENNEDY elaborates in his separate opinion, the structural and\nprocedural defects of Hamdan\u2019s commission extend far beyond rules\npreventing access to classified information.\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)               61\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nshould require, in the case of Hamdan\u2019s trial, any variance\nfrom the rules that govern courts-martial.\n   The absence of any showing of impracticability is par\nticularly disturbing when considered in light of the clear\nand admitted failure to apply one of the most fundamental\nprotections afforded not just by the Manual for Courts-\nMartial but also by the UCMJ itself: the right to be pre\nsent. See 10 U. S. C. A. \u00a7839(c) (Supp. 2006). Whether or\nnot that departure technically is \u201ccontrary to or inconsis\ntent with\u201d the terms of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. \u00a7836(a), the\njettisoning of so basic a right cannot lightly be excused as\n\u201cpracticable.\u201d\n   Under the circumstances, then, the rules applicable in\ncourts-martial must apply. Since it is undisputed that\nCommission Order No. 1 deviates in many significant\nrespects from those rules, it necessarily violates Article\n36(b).\n   The Government\u2019s objection that requiring compliance\nwith the court-martial rules imposes an undue burden\nboth ignores the plain meaning of Article 36(b) and mis\nunderstands the purpose and the history of military com\nmissions. The military commission was not born of a\ndesire to dispense a more summary form of justice than is\nafforded by courts-martial; it developed, rather, as a tri\nbunal of necessity to be employed when courts-martial\nlacked jurisdiction over either the accused or the subject\nmatter. See Winthrop 831. Exigency lent the commission\nits legitimacy, but did not further justify the wholesale\njettisoning of procedural protections. That history ex\nplains why the military commission\u2019s procedures typically\nhave been the ones used by courts-martial. That the\njurisdiction of the two tribunals today may sometimes\noverlap, see Madsen, 343 U. S., at 354, does not detract\nfrom the force of this history;53 Article 21 did not trans\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 53 JUSTICE   THOMAS relies extensively on Madsen for the proposition\n62                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nform the military commission from a tribunal of true\nexigency into a more convenient adjudicatory tool. Article\n36, confirming as much, strikes a careful balance between\nuniform procedure and the need to accommodate exigen\ncies that may sometimes arise in a theater of war. That\nArticle not having been complied with here, the rules\nspecified for Hamdan\u2019s trial are illegal.54\n                             D\n  The procedures adopted to try Hamdan also violate the\nGeneva Conventions. The Court of Appeals dismissed\nHamdan\u2019s Geneva Convention challenge on three inde\npendent grounds: (1) the Geneva Conventions are not judi\ncially enforceable; (2) Hamdan in any event is not entitled\nto their protections; and (3) even if he is entitled to their\nprotections, Councilman abstention is appropriate. Judge\nWilliams, concurring, rejected the second ground but\nagreed with the majority respecting the first and the last.\nAs we explained in Part III, supra, the abstention rule\napplied in Councilman, 420 U. S. 738, is not applicable\nhere.55 And for the reasons that follow, we hold that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthat the President has free rein to set the procedures that govern\nmilitary commissions. See post, at 30, 31, 33, n. 16, 34, and 45. That\nreliance is misplaced. Not only did Madsen not involve a law-of-war\nmilitary commission, but (1) the petitioner there did not challenge the\nprocedures used to try her, (2) the UCMJ, with its new Article 36(b),\ndid not become effective until May 31, 1951, after the petitioner\u2019s trial,\nsee 343 U. S., at 345, n. 6, and (3) the procedures used to try the peti\ntioner actually afforded more protection than those used in courts-\nmartial, see id., at 358\u2013360; see also id., at 358 (\u201c[T]he Military Gov\nernment Courts for Germany . . . have had a less military character\nthan that of courts-martial\u201d).\n   54 Prior to the enactment of Article 36(b), it may well have been the\n\ncase that a deviation from the rules governing courts-martial would not\nhave rendered the military commission \u201c \u2018illegal.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 30\u201331, n. 16\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting Winthrop 841).

Eisentrager,\n339 U. S. 763 (1950), to hold that Hamdan could not in\nvoke the Geneva Conventions to challenge the Govern\nment\u2019s plan to prosecute him in accordance with Commis\nsion Order No. 1. Eisentrager involved a challenge by 21\nGerman nationals to their 1945 convictions for war crimes\nby a military tribunal convened in Nanking, China, and to\ntheir subsequent imprisonment in occupied Germany. The\npetitioners argued, inter alia, that the 1929 Geneva Con\nvention rendered illegal some of the procedures employed\nduring their trials, which they said deviated impermissi\nbly from the procedures used by courts-martial to try\nAmerican soldiers. See id., at 789. We rejected that claim\non the merits because the petitioners (unlike Hamdan\nhere) had failed to identify any prejudicial disparity \u201cbe\ntween the Commission that tried [them] and those that\nwould try an offending soldier of the American forces of\nlike rank,\u201d and in any event could claim no protection,\nunder the 1929 Convention, during trials for crimes that\noccurred before their confinement as prisoners of war. Id.,\nat 790.56\n   Buried in a footnote of the opinion, however, is this\ncurious statement suggesting that the Court lacked power\neven to consider the merits of the Geneva Convention\nargument:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nGeneva Convention challenge is not yet \u201cripe\u201d because he has yet to be\nsentenced. See post, at 43\u201345. This is really just a species of the\nabstention argument we have already rejected. See Part III, supra.\nThe text of the Geneva Conventions does not direct an accused to wait\nuntil sentence is imposed to challenge the legality of the tribunal that\nis to try him.\n   56 As explained in Part VI\u2013C, supra, that is no longer true under the\n\n1949 Conventions.\n64                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n     \u201cWe are not holding that these prisoners have no right\n     which the military authorities are bound to respect.\n     The United States, by the Geneva Convention of July\n     27, 1929, 47 Stat. 2021, concluded with forty-six other\n     countries, including the German Reich, an agreement\n     upon the treatment to be accorded captives. These\n     prisoners claim to be and are entitled to its protection.\n     It is, however, the obvious scheme of the Agreement\n     that responsibility for observance and enforcement of\n     these rights is upon political and military authorities.\n     Rights of alien enemies are vindicated under it only\n     through protests and intervention of protecting pow\n     ers as the rights of our citizens against foreign gov\n     ernments are vindicated only by Presidential inter\n     vention.\u201d Id., at 789, n. 14.\nThe Court of Appeals, on the strength of this footnote, held\nthat \u201cthe 1949 Geneva Convention does not confer upon\nHamdan a right to enforce its provisions in court.\u201d 415\nF. 3d, at 40.\n  Whatever else might be said about the Eisentrager\nfootnote, it does not control this case. We may assume\nthat \u201cthe obvious scheme\u201d of the 1949 Conventions is\nidentical in all relevant respects to that of the 1929 Con\nvention,57 and even that that scheme would, absent some\nother provision of law, preclude Hamdan\u2019s invocation of\nthe Convention\u2019s provisions as an independent source of\nlaw binding the Government\u2019s actions and furnishing\npetitioner with any enforceable right.58 For, regardless of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  57 But   see, e.g., 4 Int\u2019l Comm. of Red Cross, Commentary: Geneva\nConvention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of\nWar 21 (1958) (hereinafter GCIV Commentary) (the 1949 Geneva\nConventions were written \u201cfirst and foremost to protect individuals,\nand not to serve State interests\u201d); GCIII Commentary 91 (\u201cIt was not\n. . . until the Conventions of 1949 . . . that the existence of \u2018rights\u2019\nconferred in prisoners of war was affirmed\u201d).\n    58 But see generally Brief for Louis Henkin et al. as Amici Curiae; 1\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

S. 407 (1886), they are, as the\nGovernment does not dispute, part of the law of war. See\nHamdi, 542 U. S., at 520\u2013521 (plurality opinion). And\ncompliance with the law of war is the condition upon\nwhich the authority set forth in Article 21 is granted.\n                               ii\n   For the Court of Appeals, acknowledgment of that condi\ntion was no bar to Hamdan\u2019s trial by commission. As an\nalternative to its holding that Hamdan could not invoke\nthe Geneva Conventions at all, the Court of Appeals con\ncluded that the Conventions did not in any event apply to\nthe armed conflict during which Hamdan was captured.\nThe court accepted the Executive\u2019s assertions that Ham\ndan was captured in connection with the United States\u2019\nwar with al Qaeda and that that war is distinct from the\nwar with the Taliban in Afghanistan. It further reasoned\nthat the war with al Qaeda evades the reach of the Geneva\nConventions. See 415 F. 3d, at 41\u201342. We, like Judge\nWilliams, disagree with the latter conclusion.\n   The conflict with al Qaeda is not, according to the Gov\nernment, a conflict to which the full protections afforded\ndetainees under the 1949 Geneva Conventions apply\nbecause Article 2 of those Conventions (which appears in\nall four Conventions) renders the full protections applica\nble only to \u201call cases of declared war or of any other armed\nconflict which may arise between two or more of the High\nContracting Parties.\u201d 6 U.

See White House Memo\nrandum, Humane Treatment of Taliban and al Qaeda Detainees 2\n(Feb. 7, 2002), available at http://www.justicescholars.org/pegc/archive/\nWhite_House/bush_memo_20020207_ed.pdf (hereinafter White House\nMemorandum).\n   61 Hamdan observes that Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention\n\nrequires that if there be \u201cany doubt\u201d whether he is entitled to prisoner-\nof-war protections, he must be afforded those protections until his\nstatus is determined by a \u201ccompetent tribunal.\u201d 6 U.

Because we\nhold that Hamdan may not, in any event, be tried by the military\ncommission the President has convened pursuant to the November 13\nOrder and Commission Order No. 1, the question whether his potential\nstatus as a prisoner of war independently renders illegal his trial by\nmilitary commission may be reserved.\n   62 The term \u201cParty\u201d here has the broadest possible meaning; a Party\n\nneed neither be a signatory of the Convention nor \u201ceven represent a\nlegal entity capable of undertaking international obligations.\u201d GCIII\nCommentary 37.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

One such provision prohibits \u201cthe\npassing of sentences and the carrying out of executions\nwithout previous judgment pronounced by a regularly\nconstituted court affording all the judicial guarantees\nwhich are recognized as indispensable by civilized peo\nples.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Court of Appeals thought, and the Government\nasserts, that Common Article 3 does not apply to Hamdan\nbecause the conflict with al Qaeda, being \u201c \u2018international in\nscope,\u2019 \u201d does not qualify as a \u201c \u2018conflict not of an interna\ntional character.\u2019 \u201d 415 F. 3d, at 41. That reasoning is\nerroneous. The term \u201cconflict not of an international\ncharacter\u201d is used here in contradistinction to a conflict\nbetween nations. So much is demonstrated by the \u201cfun\ndamental logic [of] the Convention\u2019s provisions on its\napplication.\u201d Id., at 44 (Williams, J., concurring). Com\nmon Article 2 provides that \u201cthe present Convention shall\napply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed\nconflict which may arise between two or more of the High\nContracting Parties.\u201d 6 U. S. T., at 3318 (Art. 2, \u00b61). High\nContracting Parties (signatories) also must abide by all\nterms of the Conventions vis-\u00e0-vis one another even if one\nparty to the conflict is a nonsignatory \u201cPower,\u201d and must\nso abide vis-\u00e0-vis the nonsignatory if \u201cthe latter accepts\nand applies\u201d those terms. Ibid. (Art. 2, \u00b63). Common\nArticle 3, by contrast, affords some minimal protection,\nfalling short of full protection under the Conventions, to\nindividuals associated with neither a signatory nor even a\nnonsignatory \u201cPower\u201d who are involved in a conflict \u201cin the\nterritory of\u201d a signatory. The latter kind of conflict is\ndistinguishable from the conflict described in Common\nArticle 2 chiefly because it does not involve a clash be\ntween nations (whether signatories or not). In context,\nthen, the phrase \u201cnot of an international character\u201d bears\nits literal meaning. See, e.g., J. Bentham, Introduction to\n68                     HAMDAN v.

But it\nmust be understood to incorporate at least the barest of\nthose trial protections that have been recognized by cus\ntomary international law. Many of these are described in\nArticle 75 of Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1949,\nadopted in 1977 (Protocol I). Although the United States\ndeclined to ratify Protocol I, its objections were not to\nArticle 75 thereof.

See post, at 8, 11\u201317. We\nadd only that, as noted in Part VI\u2013A, supra, various provi\nsions of Commission Order No. 1 dispense with the princi\nples, articulated in Article 75 and indisputably part of the\ncustomary international law, that an accused must, absent\ndisruptive conduct or consent, be present for his trial and\nmust be privy to the evidence against him. See \u00a7\u00a76(B)(3),\n(D).67 That the Government has a compelling interest in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsignatory include the same basic protections set forth in Article 75.\nSee, e.g., International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Art. 14,\n\u00b63(d), Mar. 23, 1976, 999 U. N. T. S. 171 (setting forth the right of an\naccused \u201c[t]o be tried in his presence, and to defend himself in person or\nthrough legal assistance of his own choosing\u201d). Following World War II,\nseveral defendants were tried and convicted by military commission for\nviolations of the law of war in their failure to afford captives fair trials\nbefore imposition and execution of sentence. In two such trials, the\nprosecutors argued that the defendants\u2019 failure to apprise accused\nindividuals of all evidence against them constituted violations of the\nlaw of war. See 5 U. N. War Crimes Commission 30 (trial of Sergeant-\nMajor Shigeru Ohashi), 75 (trial of General Tanaka Hisakasu).\n   67 The Government offers no defense of these procedures other than to\n\nobserve that the defendant may not be barred from access to evidence if\nsuch action would deprive him of a \u201cfull and fair trial.\u201d Commission\nOrder No. 1, \u00a76(D)(5)(b). But the Government suggests no circum\nstances in which it would be \u201cfair\u201d to convict the accused based on\nevidence he has not seen or heard. Cf. Crawford v. Washington, 541\nU. S. 36, 49 (2004) (\u201c \u2018It is a rule of the common law, founded on natural\njustice, that no man shall be prejudiced by evidence which he had not\nthe liberty to cross examine\u2019 \u201d (quoting State v.

Cf. post, at 47\u201348 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\nBut, at least absent express statutory provision to the\ncontrary, information used to convict a person of a crime\nmust be disclosed to him.\n                             v\n   Common Article 3 obviously tolerates a great degree of\nflexibility in trying individuals captured during armed\nconflict; its requirements are general ones, crafted to\naccommodate a wide variety of legal systems. But re\nquirements they are nonetheless. The commission that\nthe President has convened to try Hamdan does not meet\nthose requirements.\n                            VII\n  We have assumed, as we must, that the allegations\nmade in the Government\u2019s charge against Hamdan are\ntrue. We have assumed, moreover, the truth of the mes\nsage implicit in that charge\u2014viz., that Hamdan is a dan\ngerous individual whose beliefs, if acted upon, would cause\ngreat harm and even death to innocent civilians, and who\nwould act upon those beliefs if given the opportunity. It\nbears emphasizing that Hamdan does not challenge, and\nwe do not today address, the Government\u2019s power to de\ntain him for the duration of active hostilities in order to\nprevent such harm. But in undertaking to try Hamdan\nand subject him to criminal punishment, the Executive is\nbound to comply with the Rule of Law that prevails in this\njurisdiction.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nplea that evidence of guilt must be secret is abhorrent to free men\u201d\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). More fundamentally, the legality\n\nof a tribunal under Common Article 3 cannot be established by bare \n\nassurances that, whatever the character of the court or the procedures \n\nit follows, individual adjudicators will act fairly. \n\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

That claim leads me to\nstate briefly what I believe the majority sets forth both\nexplicitly and implicitly at greater length. The Court\u2019s\nconclusion ultimately rests upon a single ground: Congress\nhas not issued the Executive a \u201cblank check.\u201d Cf. Hamdi\nv. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 536 (2004) (plurality opinion).\nIndeed, Congress has denied the President the legisla-\ntive authority to create military commissions of the kind\nat issue here. Nothing prevents the President from re\nturning to Congress to seek the authority he believes\nnecessary.\n   Where, as here, no emergency prevents consultation\nwith Congress, judicial insistence upon that consultation\ndoes not weaken our Nation\u2019s ability to deal with danger.\nTo the contrary, that insistence strengthens the Nation\u2019s\nability to determine\u2014through democratic means\u2014how\nbest to do so.

This is not a\ncase, then, where the Executive can assert some unilateral\nauthority to fill a void left by congressional inaction. It is\na case where Congress, in the proper exercise of its powers\nas an independent branch of government, and as part of a\nlong tradition of legislative involvement in matters of\nmilitary justice, has considered the subject of military\ntribunals and set limits on the President\u2019s authority.\nWhere a statute provides the conditions for the exercise of\ngovernmental power, its requirements are the result of a\ndeliberative and reflective process engaging both of the\npolitical branches. Respect for laws derived from the\ncustomary operation of the Executive and Legislative\nBranches gives some assurance of stability in time of\ncrisis. The Constitution is best preserved by reliance on\nstandards tested over time and insulated from the pres\nsures of the moment.\n   These principles seem vindicated here, for a case that\n2                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                 KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\n\nmay be of extraordinary importance is resolved by ordi\nnary rules. The rules of most relevance here are those\npertaining to the authority of Congress and the interpre\ntation of its enactments.\n   It seems appropriate to recite these rather fundamental\npoints because the Court refers, as it should in its exposi\ntion of the case, to the requirement of the Geneva Conven\ntions of 1949 that military tribunals be \u201cregularly consti\ntuted\u201d ante, at 69\u2014a requirement that controls here, if for\nno other reason, because Congress requires that military\ncommissions like the ones at issue conform to the \u201claw of\nwar,\u201d 10 U. S. C. \u00a7821. Whatever the substance and con\ntent of the term \u201cregularly constituted\u201d as interpreted in\nthis and any later cases, there seems little doubt that it\nrelies upon the importance of standards deliberated upon\nand chosen in advance of crisis, under a system where the\nsingle power of the Executive is checked by other constitu\ntional mechanisms. All of which returns us to the point of\nbeginning\u2014that domestic statutes control this case. If\nCongress, after due consideration, deems it appropriate to\nchange the controlling statutes, in conformance with the\nConstitution and other laws, it has the power and preroga\ntive to do so.\n   I join the Court\u2019s opinion, save Parts V and VI\u2013D\u2013iv. To\nstate my reasons for this reservation, and to show my\nagreement with the remainder of the Court\u2019s analysis by\nidentifying particular deficiencies in the military commis\nsions at issue, this separate opinion seems appropriate.\n                              I\n  Trial by military commission raises separation-of\npowers concerns of the highest order. Located within a\nsingle branch, these courts carry the risk that offenses will\nbe defined, prosecuted, and adjudicated by executive\nofficials without independent review. Cf. Loving v. United\nStates, 517 U. S. 748, 756\u2013758, 760 (1996). Concentration of\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

It is imperative, then, that when military\ntribunals are established, full and proper authority exists\nfor the Presidential directive.\n   The proper framework for assessing whether Executive\nactions are authorized is the three-part scheme used by\nJustice Jackson in his opinion in Youngstown Sheet & Tube\nCo. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579 (1952). \u201cWhen the President\nacts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of\nCongress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all\nthat he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can\ndelegate.\u201d Id., at 635. \u201cWhen the President acts in absence\nof either a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can\nonly rely upon his own independent powers, but there is a\nzone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concur\nrent authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain.\u201d\nId., at 637. And \u201c[w]hen the President takes measures\nincompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress,\nhis power is at its lowest ebb.\u201d Ibid.\n   In this case, as the Court observes, the President has\nacted in a field with a history of congressional participa\ntion and regulation. Ante, at 28\u201330, 55\u201357. In the Uni\nform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S. C. \u00a7801 et\nseq., which Congress enacted, building on earlier statutes,\nin 1950, see Act of May 5, 1950, ch. 169, 64 Stat. 107, and\nlater amended, see, e.g., Military Justice Act of 1968, 82\nStat. 1335, Congress has set forth governing principles for\nmilitary courts. The UCMJ as a whole establishes an\nintricate system of military justice. It authorizes courts-\nmartial in various forms, 10 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7816\u2013820 (2000 ed.\nand Supp. III); it regulates the organization and procedure\nof those courts, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7822\u2013835, 851\u2013854; it defines of\nfenses, \u00a7\u00a7877\u2013934, and rights for the accused, e.g.,\n\u00a7\u00a7827(b)\u2013(c), 831, 844, 846, 855 (2000 ed.); and it provides\nmechanisms for appellate review, \u00a7\u00a7859\u2013876b (2000 ed.\n4                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\n\nand Supp. III). As explained below, the statute further\nrecognizes that special military commissions may be\nconvened to try war crimes. See infra, at 5\u20136; \u00a7821 (2000\ned.). While these laws provide authority for certain forms\nof military courts, they also impose limitations, at least\ntwo of which control this case. If the President has ex\nceeded these limits, this becomes a case of conflict between\nPresidential and congressional action\u2014a case within\nJustice Jackson\u2019s third category, not the second or first.\n  One limit on the President\u2019s authority is contained in\n\u00a7836 of the UCMJ. That section provides:\n    \u201c(a) Pretrial, trial, and post-trial procedures, including\n    modes of proof, for cases arising under this chapter\n    triable in courts-martial, military commissions and\n    other military tribunals, and procedures for courts of\n    inquiry, may be prescribed by the President by regu\n    lations which shall, so far as he considers practicable,\n    apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence\n    generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in\n    the United States district courts, but which may not\n    be contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter.\n    \u201c(b) All rules and regulations made under this article\n    shall be uniform insofar as practicable.\u201d 10 U. S. C.\n    \u00a7836 (2000 ed.).\nIn this provision the statute allows the President to im\nplement and build on the UCMJ\u2019s framework by adopting\nprocedural regulations, subject to three requirements: (1)\nProcedures for military courts must conform to district-\ncourt rules insofar as the President \u201cconsiders practica\nble\u201d; (2) the procedures may not be contrary to or inconsis\ntent with the provisions of the UCMJ; and (3) \u201cinsofar as\npracticable\u201d all rules and regulations under \u00a7836 must be\nuniform, a requirement, as the Court points out, that\nindicates the rules must be the same for military commis\nsions as for courts-martial unless such uniformity is im\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)             5\n\n                 KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\n\npracticable, ante, at 57, 59, and n. 50.\n   As the Court further instructs, even assuming the first\nand second requirements of \u00a7836 are satisfied here\u2014a\nmatter of some dispute, see ante, at 57\u201359\u2014the third\nrequires us to compare the military-commission proce\ndures with those for courts-martial and determine, to the\nextent there are deviations, whether greater uniformity\nwould be practicable. Ante, at 59\u201362. Although we can\nassume the President\u2019s practicability judgments are enti\ntled to some deference, the Court observes that Congress\u2019\nchoice of language in the uniformity provision of 10\nU. S. C. \u00a7836(b) contrasts with the language of \u00a7836(a).\nThis difference suggests, at the least, a lower degree of\ndeference for \u00a7836(b) determinations. Ante, at 59\u201360. The\nrules for military courts may depart from federal-court\nrules whenever the President \u201cconsiders\u201d conformity im\npracticable, \u00a7836(a); but the statute requires procedural\nuniformity across different military courts \u201cinsofar as\n[uniformity is] practicable,\u201d \u00a7836(b), not insofar as the\nPresident considers it to be so. The Court is right to con\nclude this is of relevance to our decision. Further, as the\nCourt is also correct to conclude, ante, at 60, the term\n\u201cpracticable\u201d cannot be construed to permit deviations\nbased on mere convenience or expedience. \u201cPracticable\u201d\nmeans \u201cfeasible,\u201d that is, \u201cpossible to practice or perform\u201d\nor \u201ccapable of being put into practice, done, or accom\nplished.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary\n1780 (1961). Congress\u2019 chosen language, then, is best\nunderstood to allow the selection of procedures based on\nlogistical constraints, the accommodation of witnesses, the\nsecurity of the proceedings, and the like. Insofar as the\n\u201c[p]retrial, trial, and post-trial procedures\u201d for the military\ncommissions at issue deviate from court-martial practice,\nthe deviations must be explained by some such practical\nneed.\n   In addition to \u00a7836, a second UCMJ provision, 10\n6                   HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                 KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\n\nU. S. C. \u00a7821, requires us to compare the commissions at\nissue to courts-martial. This provision states:\n    \u201cThe provisions of this chapter conferring jurisdiction\n    upon courts-martial do not deprive military commis\n    sions, provost courts, or other military tribunals of\n    concurrent jurisdiction with respect to offenders or of\n    fenses that by statute or by the law of war may be\n    tried by military commissions, provost courts, or other\n    military tribunals.\u201d\n   In \u00a7821 Congress has addressed the possibility that\nspecial military commissions\u2014criminal courts other than\ncourts-martial\u2014may at times be convened. At the same\ntime, however, the President\u2019s authority to convene mili\ntary commissions is limited: It extends only to \u201coffenders\nor offenses\u201d that \u201cby statute or by the law of war may be\ntried by\u201d such military commissions. Ibid.; see also ante,\nat 28\u201329. The Government does not claim to base the\ncharges against Hamdan on a statute; instead it invokes\nthe law of war. That law, as the Court explained in Ex\nparte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942), derives from \u201crules and\nprecepts of the law of nations\u201d; it is the body of international\nlaw governing armed conflict. Id., at 28. If the military\ncommission at issue is illegal under the law of war, then\nan offender cannot be tried \u201cby the law of war\u201d before that\ncommission.\n   The Court is correct to concentrate on one provision of\nthe law of war that is applicable to our Nation\u2019s armed\nconflict with al Qaeda in Afghanistan and, as a result, to\nthe use of a military commission to try Hamdan. Ante, at\n65\u201370; see also 415 F. 3d 33, 44 (CADC 2005) (Williams,\nJ., concurring). That provision is Common Article 3 of the\nfour Geneva Conventions of 1949. It prohibits, as relevant\nhere, \u201c[t]he passing of sentences and the carrying out of\nexecutions without previous judgment pronounced by a\nregularly constituted court affording all the judicial guar\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

S. T. 3316, 3318, T. I. A. S. No. 3364.\nThe provision is part of a treaty the United States has\nratified and thus accepted as binding law. See id., at\n3316. By Act of Congress, moreover, violations of Common\nArticle 3 are considered \u201cwar crimes,\u201d punishable as fed\neral offenses, when committed by or against United States\nnationals and military personnel. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a72441.\nThere should be no doubt, then, that Common Article 3 is\npart of the law of war as that term is used in \u00a7821.\n   The dissent by JUSTICE THOMAS argues that Common\nArticle 3 nonetheless is irrelevant to this case because in\nJohnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763 (1950), it was said to\nbe the \u201cobvious scheme\u201d of the 1929 Geneva Convention\nthat \u201c[r]ights of alien enemies are vindicated under it only\nthrough protests and intervention of protecting powers,\u201d\ni.e., signatory states, id., at 789, n. 14. As the Court ex\nplains, ante, at 63\u201365, this language from Eisentrager is\nnot controlling here. Even assuming the Eisentrager\nanalysis has some bearing upon the analysis of the\nbroader 1949 Conventions and that, in consequence, rights\nare vindicated \u201cunder [those Conventions]\u201d only through\nprotests and intervention, 339 U. S., at 789, n. 14, Com\nmon Article 3 is nonetheless relevant to the question of\nauthorization under \u00a7821. Common Article 3 is part of the\nlaw of war that Congress has directed the President to\nfollow in establishing military commissions. Ante, at 66\u2013\n67. Consistent with that view, the Eisentrager Court itself\nconsidered on the merits claims that \u201cprocedural irregu\nlarities\u201d under the 1929 Convention \u201cdeprive[d] the Mili\ntary Commission of jurisdiction.\u201d 339 U. S., at 789, 790.\n   In another military commission case, In re Yamashita,\n327 U. S. 1 (1946), the Court likewise considered on the\nmerits\u2014without any caveat about remedies under the\n8                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\n\nConvention\u2014a claim that an alleged violation of the 1929\nConvention \u201cestablish[ed] want of authority in the com\nmission to proceed with the trial.\u201d Id., at 23, 24. That is\nthe precise inquiry we are asked to perform here.\n   Assuming the President has authority to establish a\nspecial military commission to try Hamdan, the commis\nsion must satisfy Common Article 3\u2019s requirement of a\n\u201cregularly constituted court affording all the judicial guar\nantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized\npeoples,\u201d 6 U. S. T., at 3318. The terms of this general\nstandard are yet to be elaborated and further defined, but\nCongress has required compliance with it by referring to\nthe \u201claw of war\u201d in \u00a7821. The Court correctly concludes\nthat the military commission here does not comply with\nthis provision.\n   Common Article 3\u2019s standard of a \u201cregularly constituted\ncourt affording all the judicial guarantees which are rec\nognized as indispensable by civilized peoples,\u201d ibid., sup\nports, at the least, a uniformity principle similar to that\ncodified in \u00a7836(b). The concept of a \u201cregularly constituted\ncourt\u201d providing \u201cindispensable\u201d judicial guarantees re\nquires consideration of the system of justice under which\nthe commission is established, though no doubt certain\nminimum standards are applicable. See ante, at 69\u201370; 1\nInt\u2019l Committee of the Red Cross, Customary Interna\ntional Humanitarian Law 355 (2005) (explaining that\ncourts are \u201cregularly constituted\u201d under Common Article 3\nif they are \u201cestablished and organised in accordance with\nthe laws and procedures already in force in a country\u201d).\n   The regular military courts in our system are the courts-\nmartial established by congressional statutes. Acts of\nCongress confer on those courts the jurisdiction to try \u201cany\nperson\u201d subject to war crimes prosecution. 10 U. S. C.\n\u00a7818.

See, e.g., 1 The War\nof the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of\nthe Union and Confederate Armies 248 (2d series 1894)\n(Civil War general order requiring that military commis\nsions \u201cbe constituted in a similar manner and their pro\nceedings be conducted according to the same general rules\nas courts-martial in order to prevent abuses which might\notherwise arise\u201d); W.

Today, moreover, \u00a7836(b)\u2014\nwhich took effect after the military trials in the World War\nII cases invoked by the dissent, see Madsen v. Kinsella, 343\nU. S. 341, 344\u2013345, and n. 6 (1952); Yamashita, supra, at 5;\nQuirin, 317 U. S., at 23\u2014codifies this presumption of uni\nformity at least as to \u201c[p]retrial, trial, and post-trial proce\ndures.\u201d Absent more concrete statutory guidance, this\nhistorical and statutory background\u2014which suggests that\nsome practical need must justify deviations from the\ncourt-martial model\u2014informs the understanding of which\nmilitary courts are \u201cregularly constituted\u201d under United\nStates law.\n   In addition, whether or not the possibility, contemplated\nby the regulations here, of midtrial procedural changes\ncould by itself render a military commission impermissibly\nirregular, ante, at 70, n. 65; see also Military Commission\nOrder No. 1, \u00a711 (Aug. 31, 2005), App. to Brief for Peti\ntioner 46a\u201372a (hereinafter MCO), an acceptable degree of\n10                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                 KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\n\nindependence from the Executive is necessary to render a\ncommission \u201cregularly constituted\u201d by the standards of our\nNation\u2019s system of justice. And any suggestion of Execu\ntive power to interfere with an ongoing judicial process\nraises concerns about the proceedings\u2019 fairness. Again,\nhowever, courts-martial provide the relevant benchmark.\nSubject to constitutional limitations, see Ex parte Milligan,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1866), Congress has the power and responsibility\nto determine the necessity for military courts, and to\nprovide the jurisdiction and procedures applicable to them.\nThe guidance Congress has provided with respect to\ncourts-martial indicates the level of independence and\nprocedural rigor that Congress has deemed necessary, at\nleast as a general matter, in the military context.\n   At a minimum a military commission like the one at\nissue\u2014a commission specially convened by the President\nto try specific persons without express congressional au\nthorization\u2014can be \u201cregularly constituted\u201d by the stan\ndards of our military justice system only if some practical\nneed explains deviations from court-martial practice. In\nthis regard the standard of Common Article 3, applied\nhere in conformity with \u00a7821, parallels the practicability\nstandard of \u00a7836(b). Section 836, however, is limited by\nits terms to matters properly characterized as proce\ndural\u2014that is, \u201c[p]retrial, trial, and post-trial proce\ndures\u201d\u2014while Common Article 3 permits broader consid\neration of matters of structure, organization, and\nmechanisms to promote the tribunal\u2019s insulation from\ncommand influence. Thus the combined effect of the two\nstatutes discussed here\u2014\u00a7\u00a7836 and 821\u2014is that consid\nerations of practicability must support departures from\ncourt-martial practice. Relevant concerns, as noted ear\nlier, relate to logistical constraints, accommodation of\nwitnesses, security of the proceedings, and the like, not\nmere expedience or convenience. This determination, of\ncourse, must be made with due regard for the constitu\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a\u2013\n67a. Nevertheless, the circumstances of Hamdan\u2019s trial\npresent no exigency requiring special speed or precluding\ncareful consideration of evidence. For roughly four years,\nHamdan has been detained at a permanent United States\nmilitary base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. And regardless\nof the outcome of the criminal proceedings at issue, the\nGovernment claims authority to continue to detain him\nbased on his status as an enemy combatant.\n   Against this background, the Court is correct to con\nclude that the military commission the President has\nconvened to try Hamdan is unauthorized. Ante, at 62, 69\u2013\n70, 72. The following analysis, which expands on the\nCourt\u2019s discussion, explains my reasons for reaching this\nconclusion.\n   To begin with, the structure and composition of the\nmilitary commission deviate from conventional court-\nmartial standards. Although these deviations raise ques\ntions about the fairness of the trial, no evident practical\n12                 HAMDAN v.

At a general court-\nmartial\u2014the only type authorized to impose penalties of\nmore than one year\u2019s incarceration or to adjudicate of\nfenses against the law of war, R. C. M. 201(f); 10 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a7818\u2013820 (2000 ed. and Supp. III)\u2014the presiding officer\nwho rules on legal issues must be a military judge.\nR. C. M. 501(a)(1), 801(a)(4)\u2013(5); 10 U. S. C. \u00a7816(1) (2000\ned., Supp. III); see also R. C. M. 201(f)(2)(B)(ii) (likewise\nrequiring a military judge for certain other courts-\nmartial); 10 U. S. C. \u00a7819 (2000 ed. and Supp. III) (same).\nA military judge is an officer who is a member of a state or\nfederal bar and has been specially certified for judicial\nduties by the Judge Advocate General for the officer\u2019s\nArmed Service. R. C. M. 502(c); 10 U. S. C. \u00a7826(b). To\nprotect their independence, military judges at general\ncourts-martial are \u201cassigned and directly responsible to\nthe Judge Advocate General or the Judge Advocate Gen\neral\u2019s designee.\u201d R. C. M. 502(c). They must be detailed to\nthe court, in accordance with applicable regulations, \u201cby a\nperson assigned as a military judge and directly responsi\nble to the Judge Advocate General or the Judge Advocate\nGeneral\u2019s designee.\u201d R. C. M. 503(b); see also 10 U. S. C.\n\u00a7826(c); see generally Weiss v. United States, 510 U. S. 163,\n179\u2013181 (1994) (discussing provisions that \u201cinsulat[e] mili\ntary judges from the effects of command influence\u201d and thus\n\u201cpreserve judicial impartiality\u201d). Here, by contrast, the\nAppointing Authority selects the presiding officer, MCO\nNo. 1, \u00a7\u00a74(A)(1), (A)(4); and that officer need only be a\njudge advocate, that is, a military lawyer, \u00a74(A)(4).\n14                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                 KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\n\n   The Appointing Authority, moreover, exercises supervi\nsory powers that continue during trial. Any interlocutory\nquestion \u201cthe disposition of which would effect a termina\ntion of proceedings with respect to a charge\u201d is subject to\ndecision not by the presiding officer, but by the Appointing\nAuthority. \u00a74(A)(5)(e) (stating that the presiding officer\n\u201cshall certify\u201d such questions to the Appointing Authority).\nOther interlocutory questions may be certified to the\nAppointing Authority as the presiding officer \u201cdeems\nappropriate.\u201d Ibid. While in some circumstances the\nGovernment may appeal certain rulings at a court-\nmartial\u2014including \u201can order or ruling that terminates the\nproceedings with respect to a charge or specification,\u201d\nR. C. M. 908(a); see also 10 U. S. C. \u00a7862(a)\u2014the appeals\ngo to a body called the Court of Criminal Appeals, not to\nthe convening authority. R. C. M. 908; 10 U. S. C. \u00a7862(b);\nsee also R. C. M. 1107 (requiring the convening authority\nto approve or disapprove the findings and sentence of a\ncourt-martial but providing for such action only after\nentry of sentence and restricting actions that increase\npenalties); 10 U. S. C. \u00a7860 (same); cf. \u00a7837(a) (barring\ncommand influence on court-martial actions). The Court\nof Criminal Appeals functions as the military\u2019s intermedi\nate appeals court; it is established by the Judge Advocate\nGeneral for each Armed Service and composed of appellate\nmilitary judges. R. C. M. 1203; 10 U. S. C. \u00a7866. This is\nanother means in which, by structure and tradition, the\ncourt-martial process is insulated from those who have an\ninterest in the outcome of the proceedings.\n   Finally, in addition to these powers with respect to the\npresiding officer, the Appointing Authority has greater\nflexibility in appointing commission members. While a\ngeneral court-martial requires, absent a contrary election\nby the accused, at least five members, R. C. M. 501(a)(1);\n10 U. S. C. \u00a7816(1) (2000 ed. and Supp. III), the Appoint\ning Authority here is free, as noted earlier, to select as few\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

This difference may affect\nthe deliberative process and the prosecution\u2019s burden of\npersuasion.\n   As compared to the role of the convening authority in a\ncourt-martial, the greater powers of the Appointing Au\nthority here\u2014including even the resolution of dispositive\nissues in the middle of the trial\u2014raise concerns that the\ncommission\u2019s decisionmaking may not be neutral. If the\ndifferences are supported by some practical need beyond\nthe goal of constant and ongoing supervision, that need is\nneither apparent from the record nor established by the\nGovernment\u2019s submissions.\n   It is no answer that, at the end of the day, the Detainee\nTreatment Act of 2005 (DTA), 119 Stat. 2739, affords\nmilitary-commission defendants the opportunity for judi\ncial review in federal court. As the Court is correct to\nobserve, the scope of that review is limited, DTA\n\u00a71005(e)(3)(D), id., at 2743; see also ante, at 8\u20139, and the\nreview is not automatic if the defendant\u2019s sentence is\nunder 10 years, \u00a71005(e)(3)(B), ibid. Also, provisions for\nreview of legal issues after trial cannot correct for struc\ntural defects, such as the role of the Appointing Authority,\nthat can cast doubt on the factfinding process and the\npresiding judge\u2019s exercise of discretion during trial. Before\nmilitary-commission defendants may obtain judicial re\nview, furthermore, they must navigate a military review\nprocess that again raises fairness concerns. At the outset,\nthe Appointing Authority (unless the Appointing Author\nity is the Secretary of Defense) performs an \u201cadministra\ntive review\u201d of undefined scope, ordering any \u201csupplemen\ntary proceedings\u201d deemed necessary. MCO No. 1 \u00a76(H)(3).\nAfter that the case is referred to a three-member\nReview Panel composed of officers selected by the\nSecretary of Defense. \u00a76(H)(4); MCI No. 9, \u00a74(B) (Oct. 11,\n2005), available at www.defenselink.mil/news/Oct2005/\nd20051014MCI9.pdf.        Though the Review Panel may\n16                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\n\nreturn the case for further proceedings only if a majority\n\u201cform[s] a definite and firm conviction that a material\nerror of law occurred,\u201d MCO No. 1, \u00a76(H)(4); MCI No. 9,\n\u00a74(C)(1)(a), only one member must have \u201cexperience as a\njudge,\u201d MCO No. 1, \u00a76(H)(4); nothing in the regulations\nrequires that other panel members have legal training.\nBy comparison to the review of court-martial judgments\nperformed by such independent bodies as the Judge Advo\ncate General, the Court of Criminal Appeals, and the\nCourt of Appeals for the Armed Forces, 10 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7862,\n864, 866, 867, 869, the review process here lacks struc\ntural protections designed to help ensure impartiality.\n   These structural differences between the military com\nmissions and courts-martial\u2014the concentration of func\ntions, including legal decisionmaking, in a single executive\nofficial; the less rigorous standards for composition of the\ntribunal; and the creation of special review procedures in\nplace of institutions created and regulated by Congress\u2014\nremove safeguards that are important to the fairness of\nthe proceedings and the independence of the court. Con\ngress has prescribed these guarantees for courts-martial;\nand no evident practical need explains the departures\nhere. For these reasons the commission cannot be consid\nered regularly constituted under United States law and\nthus does not satisfy Congress\u2019 requirement that military\ncommissions conform to the law of war.\n   Apart from these structural issues, moreover, the basic\nprocedures for the commissions deviate from procedures\nfor courts-martial, in violation of \u00a7836(b). As the Court\nexplains, ante, at 51, 61, the Military Commission Order\nabandons the detailed Military Rules of Evidence, which\nare modeled on the Federal Rules of Evidence in confor\nmity with \u00a7836(a)\u2019s requirement of presumptive compli\nance with district-court rules.\n   Instead, the order imposes just one evidentiary rule:\n\u201cEvidence shall be admitted if . . . the evidence would have\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)         17\n\n                KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\n\nprobative value to a reasonable person,\u201d MCO No. 1,\n\u00a76(D)(1). Although it is true some military commissions\napplied an amorphous evidence standard in the past, see,\ne.g., 1 Law Reports 117\u2013118 (discussing World War II\nmilitary commission orders); Exec. Order No. 9185, 7 Fed.\nReg. 5103 (1942) (order convening military commission to\ntry Nazi saboteurs), the evidentiary rules for those com\nmissions were adopted before Congress enacted the uni\nformity requirement of 10 U. S. C. \u00a7836(b) as part of the\nUCMJ, see Act of May 5, 1950, ch. 169, 64 Stat. 107, 120,\n149. And while some flexibility may be necessary to per\nmit trial of battlefield captives like Hamdan, military\nstatutes and rules already provide for introduction of\ndeposition testimony for absent witnesses, 10 U. S. C.\n\u00a7849(d); R. C. M. 702, and use of classified information,\nMilitary Rule Evid. 505. Indeed, the deposition-testimony\nprovision specifically mentions military commissions and\nthus is one of the provisions the Government concedes\nmust be followed by the commission at issue. See ante, at\n58. That provision authorizes admission of deposition\ntestimony only if the witness is absent for specified rea\nsons, \u00a7849(d)\u2014a requirement that makes no sense if\nmilitary commissions may consider all probative evidence.\nWhether or not this conflict renders the rules at issue\n\u201ccontrary to or inconsistent with\u201d the UCMJ under\n\u00a7836(a), it creates a uniformity problem under \u00a7836(b).\n   The rule here could permit admission of multiple hear\nsay and other forms of evidence generally prohibited on\ngrounds of unreliability. Indeed, the commission regula\ntions specifically contemplate admission of unsworn writ\nten statements, MCO No. 1, \u00a76(D)(3); and they make no\nprovision for exclusion of coerced declarations save those\n\u201cestablished to have been made as a result of torture,\u201d\nMCI No. 10, \u00a73(A) (Mar. 24, 2006), available at www.\ndefenselink.mil/news/Mar2006/d20060327MCI10.pdf; cf.\nMilitary Rule Evid. 304(c)(3) (generally barring use of\n18                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\n\nstatements obtained \u201cthrough the use of coercion, unlaw\nful influence, or unlawful inducement\u201d); 10 U. S. C.\n\u00a7831(d) (same). Besides, even if evidence is deemed non-\nprobative by the presiding officer at Hamdan\u2019s trial, the\nmilitary-commission members still may view it. In an\nother departure from court-martial practice the military\ncommission members may object to the presiding officer\u2019s\nevidence rulings and determine themselves, by majority\nvote, whether to admit the evidence. MCO No. 1, \u00a76(D)(1);\ncf. R. C. M. 801(a)(4), (e)(1) (providing that the military\njudge at a court-martial determines all questions of law).\n   As the Court explains, the Government has made no\ndemonstration of practical need for these special rules and\nprocedures, either in this particular case or as to the\nmilitary commissions in general, ante, at 59\u201361; nor is any\nsuch need self-evident. For all the Government\u2019s regula\ntions and submissions reveal, it would be feasible for most,\nif not all, of the conventional military evidence rules and\nprocedures to be followed.\n   In sum, as presently structured, Hamdan\u2019s military\ncommission exceeds the bounds Congress has placed on\nthe President\u2019s authority in \u00a7\u00a7836 and 821 of the UCMJ.\nBecause Congress has prescribed these limits, Congress\ncan change them, requiring a new analysis consistent with\nthe Constitution and other governing laws. At this time,\nhowever, we must apply the standards Congress has\nprovided. By those standards the military commission is\ndeficient.\n                            III\n  In light of the conclusion that the military commission\nhere is unauthorized under the UCMJ, I see no need to\nconsider several further issues addressed in the plurality\nopinion by JUSTICE STEVENS and the dissent by JUSTICE\nTHOMAS.\n  First, I would not decide whether Common Article 3\u2019s\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

S. T., at 3320 (\u00b6(1)(d))\u2014\nnecessarily requires that the accused have the right to be\npresent at all stages of a criminal trial. As JUSTICE\nSTEVENS explains, Military Commission Order No. 1\nauthorizes exclusion of the accused from the proceedings if\nthe presiding officer determines that, among other things,\nprotection of classified information so requires.         See\n\u00a7\u00a76(B)(3), (D)(5); ante, at 50. JUSTICE STEVENS observes\nthat these regulations create the possibility of a conviction\nand sentence based on evidence Hamdan has not seen or\nheard\u2014a possibility the plurality is correct to consider\ntroubling. Ante, at 71\u201372, n. 67 (collecting cases); see also\nIn re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257, 277 (1948) (finding \u201cno support\nfor sustaining petitioner\u2019s conviction of contempt of court\nupon testimony given in petitioner\u2019s absence\u201d).\n  As the dissent by JUSTICE THOMAS points out, however,\nthe regulations bar the presiding officer from admitting\nsecret evidence if doing so would deprive the accused of a\n\u201cfull and fair trial.\u201d MCO No. 1, \u00a76(D)(5)(b); see also post,\nat 47. This fairness determination, moreover, is unambi\nguously subject to judicial review under the DTA. See\n\u00a71005(e)(3)(D)(i), 119 Stat. 2743 (allowing review of com\npliance with the \u201cstandards and procedures\u201d in Military\nCommission Order No. 1). The evidentiary proceedings at\nHamdan\u2019s trial have yet to commence, and it remains to be\nseen whether he will suffer any prejudicial exclusion.\n  There should be reluctance, furthermore, to reach un\nnecessarily the question whether, as the plurality seems to\nconclude, ante, at 70, Article 75 of Protocol I to the Geneva\nConventions is binding law notwithstanding the earlier\ndecision by our Government not to accede to the Protocol.\nFor all these reasons, and without detracting from the\nimportance of the right of presence, I would rely on other\ndeficiencies noted here and in the opinion by the Court\u2014\n20                HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\n\ndeficiencies that relate to the structure and procedure of\nthe commission and that inevitably will affect the proceed\nings\u2014as the basis for finding the military commissions\nlack authorization under 10 U. S. C. \u00a7836 and fail to be\nregularly constituted under Common Article 3 and \u00a7821.\n  I likewise see no need to address the validity of the\nconspiracy charge against Hamdan\u2014an issue addressed at\nlength in Part V of JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 opinion and in Part\nII\u2013C of JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019 dissent. See ante, at 36\u201349; post,\nat 12\u201328. In light of the conclusion that the military\ncommissions at issue are unauthorized Congress may\nchoose to provide further guidance in this area. Congress,\nnot the Court, is the branch in the better position to un\ndertake the \u201csensitive task of establishing a principle not\ninconsistent with the national interest or international\njustice.\u201d Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U. S.\n398, 428 (1964).\n  Finally, for the same reason, I express no view on the\nmerits of other limitations on military commissions de\nscribed as elements of the common law of war in Part V of\nJUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 opinion. See ante, at 31\u201336, 48\u201349; post,\nat 6\u201312.\n  With these observations I join the Court\u2019s opinion with\nthe exception of Parts V and VI\u2013D\u2013iv.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

DONALD\n  H. RUMSFELD, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n                        [June 29, 2006] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS and\nJUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting.\n   On December 30, 2005, Congress enacted the Detainee\nTreatment Act (DTA). It unambiguously provides that, as\nof that date, \u201cno court, justice, or judge\u201d shall have juris\ndiction to consider the habeas application of a Guan\ntanamo Bay detainee. Notwithstanding this plain direc\ntive, the Court today concludes that, on what it calls the\nstatute\u2019s most natural reading, every \u201ccourt, justice, or\njudge\u201d before whom such a habeas application was pend\ning on December 30 has jurisdiction to hear, consider, and\nrender judgment on it. This conclusion is patently errone\nous. And even if it were not, the jurisdiction supposedly\nretained should, in an exercise of sound equitable discre\ntion, not be exercised.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n  The DTA provides: \u201c[N]o court, justice, or judge shall\nhave jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a\nwrit of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien\ndetained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo\nBay, Cuba.\u201d \u00a71005(e)(1), 119 Stat. 2742 (internal division\nomitted). This provision \u201ct[ook] effect on the date of the\nenactment of this Act,\u201d \u00a71005(h)(1), id., at 2743, which was\n2                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nDecember 30, 2005. As of that date, then, no court had\njurisdiction to \u201chear or consider\u201d the merits of petitioner\u2019s\nhabeas application. This repeal of jurisdiction is simply\nnot ambiguous as between pending and future cases. It\nprohibits any exercise of jurisdiction, and it became effec\ntive as to all cases last December 30. It is also perfectly\nclear that the phrase \u201cno court, justice, or judge\u201d includes\nthis Court and its Members, and that by exercising our\nappellate jurisdiction in this case we are \u201chear[ing] or\nconsider[ing] . . . an application for a writ of habeas\ncorpus.\u201d\n   An ancient and unbroken line of authority attests that\nstatutes ousting jurisdiction unambiguously apply to cases\npending at their effective date. For example, in Bruner v.\nUnited States, 343 U. S. 112 (1952), we granted certiorari\nto consider whether the Tucker Act\u2019s provision denying\ndistrict court jurisdiction over suits by \u201cofficers\u201d of the\nUnited States barred a suit by an employee of the United\nStates. After we granted certiorari, Congress amended\nthe Tucker Act by adding suits by \u201c \u2018employees\u2019 \u201d to the\nprovision barring jurisdiction over suits by officers. Id., at\n114. This statute narrowing the jurisdiction of the district\ncourts \u201cbecame effective\u201d while the case was pending\nbefore us, ibid., and made no explicit reference to pending\ncases. Because the statute \u201cdid not reserve jurisdiction\nover pending cases,\u201d id., at 115, we held that it clearly\nousted jurisdiction over them. Summarizing centuries of\npractice, we said: \u201cThis rule\u2014that, when a law conferring\njurisdiction is repealed without any reservation as to\npending cases, all cases fall with the law\u2014has been ad\nhered to consistently by this Court.\u201d Id., at 116\u2013117. See\nalso Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 274\n(1994) (opinion for the Court by STEVENS, J.) (\u201cWe have\nregularly applied intervening statutes conferring or oust\ning jurisdiction, whether or not jurisdiction lay when the\nunderlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n  This venerable rule that statutes ousting jurisdiction\nterminate jurisdiction in pending cases is not, as today\u2019s\nopinion for the Court would have it, a judge-made \u201cpre\nsumption against jurisdiction,\u201d ante, at 11, that we have\ninvented to resolve an ambiguity in the statutes. It is\nsimple recognition of the reality that the plain import of a\nstatute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to\nconsider and render judgment\u2014in an already pending\ncase no less than in a case yet to be filed.\n    \u201cWithout jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all\n    in any cause. Jurisdiction is power to declare the law,\n    and when it ceases to exist, the only function remain\n    ing to the court is that of announcing the fact and\n    dismissing the cause. And this is not less clear upon\n    authority than upon principle.\u201d Ex parte McCardle,\n    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88034\"><a href=\"/opinion/88034/ex-parte-mccardle/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 514 (1869) (emphasis added).\n  To alter this plain meaning, our cases have required an\nexplicit reservation of pending cases in the jurisdiction-\nrepealing statute. For example, Bruner, as mentioned,\nlooked to whether Congress made \u201cany reservation as to\npending cases.\u201d 343 U. S., at 116\u2013117; see also id., at 115\n(\u201cCongress made no provision for cases pending at the\neffective date of the Act withdrawing jurisdiction and, for\nthis reason, Courts of Appeals ordered pending cases\nterminated for want of jurisdiction\u201d). Likewise, in Hallo\nwell v. Commons, 239 U.

Grant, 98 U. S.\n398, 403 (1879).\n   The Court claims that I \u201crea[d] too much into\u201d the\nBruner line of cases, ante, at 12, n. 7, and that \u201cthe Bruner\nrule\u201d has never been \u201can inflexible trump,\u201d ante, at 19.\nBut the Court sorely misdescribes Bruner\u2014as if it were a\nkind of early-day Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320 (1997),\nresolving statutory ambiguity by oblique negative infer\nence. On the contrary, as described above, Bruner stated\nits holding as an unqualified \u201crule,\u201d which \u201chas been ad\nhered to consistently by this Court.\u201d 343 U. S., at 116\u2013\n117. Though Bruner referred to an express savings clause\nelsewhere in the statute, id., at 115, n. 7, it disavowed any\nreliance on such oblique indicators to vary the plain mean\ning, quoting Ritchie at length: \u201c \u2018It is quite possible that\nthis effect of the [jurisdiction-stripping statute] was not\ncontemplated by Congress. . . . [B]ut when terms are\nunambiguous we may not speculate on probabilities of\nintention.\u2019 \u201d 343 U. S., at 116 (quoting 5 Wall., at 544\u2013\n545).\n   The Court also attempts to evade the Bruner line of\ncases by asserting that \u201cthe \u2018presumption\u2019 [of application\nto pending cases] that these cases have applied is more\naccurately viewed as the nonapplication of another pre\nsumption\u2014viz., the presumption against retroactivity\u2014in\ncertain limited circumstances.\u201d Ante, at 11. I have al\nready explained that what the Court calls a \u201cpresumption\u201d\nis simply the acknowledgment of the unambiguous mean\ning of such provisions. But even taking it to be what the\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

Prospective applications of a statute are \u201ceffective\u201d\nupon the statute\u2019s effective date; that is what an effective-\ndate provision like \u00a71005(h)(1) means.1 \u201c \u2018[S]hall take\neffect upon enactment\u2019 is presumed to mean \u2018shall have\nprospective effect upon enactment,\u2019 and that presumption\nis too strong to be overcome by any negative inference\n[drawn from other provisions of the statute].\u201d Landgraf,\n511 U. S., at 288 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgments).\nThe Court\u2019s \u201cnonapplication of . . . the presumption\nagainst retroactivity\u201d to \u00a71005(e)(1) is thus just another\nway of stating that the statute takes immediate effect in\npending cases.\n  Though the Court resists the Bruner rule, it cannot cite\na single case in the history of Anglo-American law (before\ntoday) in which a jurisdiction-stripping provision was\ndenied immediate effect in pending cases, absent an ex\nplicit statutory reservation. By contrast, the cases grant\ning such immediate effect are legion, and they repeatedly\nrely on the plain language of the jurisdictional repeal as\nan \u201cinflexible trump,\u201d ante, at 19, by requiring an express\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Court apparently believes that the effective-date provision\n\nmeans nothing at all. \u201cThat paragraph (1), along with paragraphs (2)\nand (3), is to \u2018take effect on the date of enactment,\u2019 DTA \u00a71005(h)(1),\n119 Stat. 2743, is not dispositive,\u201d says the Court, ante, at 14, n. 9. The\nCourt\u2019s authority for this conclusion is its quote from INS v. St. Cyr,\n533 U. S. 289, 317 (2001), to the effect that \u201ca statement that a statute\nwill become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest\nthat it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.\u201d\nAnte, at 14, n. 9 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted).\nBut this quote merely restates the obvious: An effective-date provision\ndoes not render a statute applicable to \u201cconduct that occurred at an\nearlier date,\u201d but of course it renders the statute applicable to conduct\nthat occurs on the effective date and all future dates\u2014such as the\nCourt\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction here. The Court seems to suggest that,\nbecause the effective-date provision does not authorize retroactive\napplication, it also fails to authorize prospective application (and is\nthus useless verbiage). This cannot be true.\n6                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nreservation to save pending cases. See, e.g., Bruner, su\npra, at 115; Kline v.

Specifically, it appeals to the fact that\n\u00a71005(e)(2) and (e)(3) are explicitly made applicable to\npending cases (by \u00a71005(h)(2)). A negative inference of the\nsort the Court relies upon might clarify the meaning of an\nambiguous provision, but since the meaning of \u00a71005(e)(1)\nis entirely clear, the omitted language in that context\nwould have been redundant.\n   Even if \u00a71005(e)(1) were at all ambiguous in its applica\ntion to pending cases, the \u201cnegative inference\u201d from\n\u00a71005(h)(2) touted by the Court would have no force. The\nnumerous cases in the Bruner line would at least create a\npowerful default \u201cpresumption against jurisdiction,\u201d ante,\nat 11. The negative inference urged by the Court would be\na particularly awkward and indirect way of rebutting such\na longstanding and consistent practice. This is especially\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ntrue since the negative inference that might be drawn\nfrom \u00a71005(h)(2)\u2019s specification that certain provisions\nshall apply to pending cases is matched by a negative\ninference in the opposite direction that might be drawn\nfrom \u00a71005(b)(2), which provides that certain provisions\nshall not apply to pending cases.\n  The Court\u2019s reliance on our opinion in Lindh v. Murphy,\n521 U. S. 320 (1997), is utterly misplaced. Lindh involved\ntwo provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA): a set of amendments to\nchapter 153 of the federal habeas statute that redefined\nthe scope of collateral review by federal habeas courts; and\na provision creating a new chapter 154 in the habeas\nstatute specially to govern federal collateral review of\nstate capital cases. See 521 U. S., at 326\u2013327. The latter\nprovision explicitly rendered the new chapter 154 applica\nble to cases pending at the time of AEDPA\u2019s enactment;\nthe former made no specific reference to pending cases.\nId., at 327. In Lindh, we drew a negative inference from\nchapter 154\u2019s explicit reference to pending cases, to con\nclude that the chapter 153 amendments did not apply in\npending cases. It was essential to our reasoning, however,\nthat both provisions appeared to be identically difficult to\nclassify under our retroactivity cases. First, we noted\nthat, after Landgraf, there was reason for Congress to\nsuppose that an explicit statement was required to render\nthe amendments to chapter 154 applicable in pending\ncases, because the new chapter 154 \u201cwill have substantive\nas well as purely procedural effects.\u201d 521 U. S., at 327.\nThe next step\u2014and the critical step\u2014in our reasoning was\nthat Congress had identical reason to suppose that an\nexplicit statement would be required to apply the chapter\n153 amendments to pending cases, but did not provide it.\nId., at 329. The negative inference of Lindh rested on the\nfact that \u201c[n]othing . . . but a different intent explain[ed]\nthe different treatment.\u201d Ibid.\n8                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   Here, by contrast, there is ample reason for the different\ntreatment. The exclusive-review provisions of the DTA,\nunlike both \u00a71005(e)(1) and the AEDPA amendments in\nLindh, confer new jurisdiction (in the D. C. Circuit) where\nthere was none before. For better or for worse, our recent\ncases have contrasted jurisdiction-creating provisions with\njurisdiction-ousting provisions, retaining the venerable\nrule that the latter are not retroactive even when applied\nin pending cases, but strongly indicating that the former\nare typically retroactive. For example, we stated in\nHughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer, 520\nU. S. 939, 951 (1997), that a statute \u201cthat creates jurisdic\ntion where none previously existed\u201d is \u201cas much subject to\nour presumption against retroactivity as any other.\u201d See\nalso Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U. S. 677, 695\n(2004) (opinion for the Court by STEVENS, J.); id., at 722\n(KENNEDY, J., dissenting). The Court gives our retroactiv\nity jurisprudence a dazzling clarity in asserting that \u201csub\nsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) \u2018confer\u2019 jurisdiction in a manner\nthat cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions\nunder our precedents.\u201d2 Ante, at 17\u201318.

Any\n     test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement\n     in hard cases, and is unlikely to classify the enormous\n     variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical\n     clarity. However, retroactivity is a matter on which\n     judges tend to have \u2018sound . . . instinct[s],\u2019 . . . and fa\n     miliar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reli\n     ance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance.\u201d\n     Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 270 (opinion for the Court by\n     STEVENS, J.).\nThe only \u201cfamiliar consideration,\u201d \u201creasonable reliance,\u201d\nand \u201csettled expectation\u201d I am aware of pertaining to the\npresent case is the rule of Bruner\u2014applicable to\n\u00a71005(e)(1), but not to \u00a71005(e)(2) and (3)\u2014which the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nHistorically, federal courts have never reviewed the validity of the final\ndecision of any military commission; their jurisdiction has been re\nstricted to considering the commission\u2019s \u201clawful authority to hear,\ndecide and condemn,\u201d In re Yamashita, 327 U. S. 1, 8 (1946) (emphasis\nadded). See also Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763, 786\u2013787 (1950).\nThus, contrary to the Court\u2019s suggestion, ante, at 17, subsections (e)(2)\nand (e)(3) confer new jurisdiction: They impose judicial oversight on a\ntraditionally unreviewable exercise of military authority by the Com\nmander in Chief. They arguably \u201cspea[k] not just to the power of a\nparticular court but to . . . substantive rights . . . as well,\u201d Hughes\nAircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Shumer, 520 U. S. 939, 951 (1997)\u2014\nnamely, the unreviewable powers of the President. Our recent cases\nhad reiterated that the Executive is protected by the presumption\nagainst retroactivity in such comparatively trivial contexts as suits for\ntax refunds and increased pay, see Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511\nU. S. 244, 271, n. 25 (1994).\n10                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nCourt stubbornly disregards. It is utterly beyond question\nthat \u00a71005(e)(2)\u2019s and (3)\u2019s application to pending cases\n(without explicit specification) was not as clear as\n\u00a71005(e)(1)\u2019s. That is alone enough to explain the differ\nence in treatment.\n   Another obvious reason for the specification was to stave\noff any Suspension Clause problems raised by the imme\ndiately effective ouster of jurisdiction brought about by\nsubsection (e)(1). That is to say, specification of the im\nmediate effectiveness of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3)\n(which, unlike subsection (e)(1), would not fall within the\nBruner rule and would not automatically be deemed appli\ncable in pending cases) could reasonably have been\nthought essential to be sure of replacing the habeas juris\ndiction that subsection (e)(1) eliminated in pending cases\nwith an adequate substitute. See infra, at 16\u201318.\n   These considerations by no means prove that an explicit\nstatement would be required to render subsections (e)(2)\nand (e)(3) applicable in pending cases. But they surely\ngave Congress ample reason to doubt that their applica\ntion in pending cases would unfold as naturally as the\nCourt glibly assumes. In any event, even if it were true\nthat subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) \u201c \u2018confer\u2019 jurisdiction in a\nmanner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity\nquestions,\u201d ante, at 17\u201318, this would merely establish\nthat subsection (h)(2)\u2019s reference to pending cases was\nwholly superfluous when applied to subsections (e)(2) and\n(e)(3), just as it would have been for subsection (e)(1).\nLindh\u2019s negative inference makes sense only when Con\ngress would have perceived \u201cthe wisdom of being explicit\u201d\nwith respect to the immediate application of both of two\nstatutory provisions, 521 U. S., at 328, but chose to be\nexplicit only for one of them\u2014not when it would have\nperceived no need to be explicit for both, but enacted a\nredundancy only for one.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           11\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   In short, it is simply untrue that Congress \u201c \u2018should have\nbeen just as concerned about\u2019 \u201d specifying the application\nof \u00a71005(e)(1) to pending cases, ante, at 14 (quoting Lindh,\n521 U. S., at 329). In fact, the negative-inference ap\nproach of Lindh is particularly inappropriate in this case,\nbecause the negative inference from \u00a71005(h)(2) would\ntend to defeat the purpose of the very provisions that are\nexplicitly rendered applicable in pending cases, \u00a71005(e)(2)\nand (3). Those provisions purport to vest \u201cexclusive\u201d\njurisdiction in the D. C. Circuit to consider the claims\nraised by petitioners here. See infra, at 16\u201318. By draw\ning a negative inference \u00e0 la Lindh, the Court supplants\nthis exclusive-review mechanism with a dual-review\nmechanism for petitioners who were expeditious enough to\nfile applications challenging the CSRTs or military com\nmissions before December 30, 2005. Whatever the force of\nLindh\u2019s negative inference in other cases, it surely should\nnot apply here to defeat the purpose of the very provision\nfrom which the negative inference is drawn.\n                             C\n   Worst of all is the Court\u2019s reliance on the legislative\nhistory of the DTA to buttress its implausible reading of\n\u00a71005(e)(1). We have repeatedly held that such reliance is\nimpermissible where, as here, the statutory language is\nunambiguous. But the Court nevertheless relies both on\nfloor statements from the Senate and (quite heavily) on\nthe drafting history of the DTA. To begin with floor\nstatements: The Court urges that some \u201cstatements made\nby Senators preceding passage of the Act lend further\nsupport to\u201d the Court\u2019s interpretation, citing excerpts from\nthe floor debate that support its view, ante, 15\u201316, n. 10.\nThe Court immediately goes on to discount numerous floor\nstatements by the DTA\u2019s sponsors that flatly contradict its\nview, because \u201cthose statements appear to have been\ninserted into the Congressional Record after the Senate\n12                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ndebate.\u201d Ibid. Of course this observation, even if true,\nmakes no difference unless one indulges the fantasy that\nSenate floor speeches are attended (like the Philippics of\nDemosthenes) by throngs of eager listeners, instead of\nbeing delivered (like Demosthenes\u2019 practice sessions on\nthe beach) alone into a vast emptiness. Whether the floor\nstatements are spoken where no Senator hears, or written\nwhere no Senator reads, they represent at most the views\nof a single Senator. In any event, the Court greatly exag\ngerates the one-sidedness of the portions of the floor de\nbate that clearly occurred before the DTA\u2019s enactment.\nSome of the statements of Senator Graham, a sponsor of\nthe bill, only make sense on the assumption that pending\ncases are covered.3 And at least one opponent of the DTA\nunmistakably expressed his understanding that it would\nterminate our jurisdiction in this very case.4 (Of course in\nits discussion of legislative history the Court wholly ig\nnores the President\u2019s signing statement, which explicitly\nset forth his understanding that the DTA ousted jurisdic\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 \u201cBecause I have described how outrageous these claims are\u2014about\n\nthe exercise regime, the reading materials\u2014most Americans would be\nhighly offended to know that terrorists are suing us in our own courts\nabout what they read.\u201d 151 Cong.

The Court\u2019s reliance on\nsuch statements cannot avoid the appearance of similar\nopportunism. In a virtually identical context, the author\nof today\u2019s opinion has written for the Court that \u201c[t]he\nlegislative history discloses some frankly partisan state\nments about the meaning of the final effective date lan\nguage, but those statements cannot plausibly be read as\nreflecting any general agreement.\u201d Landgraf, 511 U. S., at\n262 (opinion for the Court by STEVENS, J.). Likewise, the\nhandful of floor statements that the Court treats as au\nthoritative do not \u201creflec[t] any general agreement.\u201d They\nreflect the now-common tactic\u2014which the Court once\nagain rewards\u2014of pursuing through floor-speech ipse dixit\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 \u201c[T]he executive branch shall construe section 1005 to preclude the\n\nFederal courts from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over any\nexisting or future action, including applications for writs of habeas\ncorpus, described in section 1005.\u201d President\u2019s Statement on Signing\nof H. R. 2863, the \u201cDepartment of Defense, Emergency Supple\nmental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of\nMexico, and Pandemic Influenza Act, 2006\u201d (Dec. 30, 2005), available\nat      http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/12/print/20051230\n8.html.\n14                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nwhat could not be achieved through the constitutionally\nprescribed method of putting language into a bill that a\nmajority of both Houses vote for and the President signs.\n    With regard to the floor statements, at least the Court\nshows some semblance of seemly shame, tucking away its\nreference to them in a half-hearted footnote. Not so for its\nreliance on the DTA\u2019s drafting history, which is displayed\nprominently, see ante, at 14\u201315. I have explained else\nwhere that such drafting history is no more legitimate or\nreliable an indicator of the objective meaning of a statute\nthan any other form of legislative history. This case pre\nsents a textbook example of its unreliability. The Court,\nante, at 14, trumpets the fact that a bill considered in the\nSenate included redundant language, not included in the\nDTA as passed, reconfirming that the abolition of habeas\njurisdiction \u201cshall apply to any application or other action\nthat is pending on or after the date of the enactment of\nthis Act.\u201d 151 Cong. Rec. S12655 (Nov. 10, 2005). But this\nearlier version of the bill also differed from the DTA in\nother material respects. Most notably, it provided for\npostdecision review by the D. C. Circuit only of the deci\nsions of CSRTs, not military commissions, ibid.; and it\nlimited that review to whether \u201cthe status determination\n. . . was consistent with the procedures and standards\nspecified by the Secretary of Defense,\u201d ibid., not whether\n\u201cthe use of such standards and procedures . . . is consistent\nwith the Constitution and laws of the United States,\u201d DTA\n\u00a71005(e)(2)(C)(ii), 119 Stat. 2742. To say that what moved\nSenators to reject this earlier bill was the \u201caction that is\npending\u201d provision surpasses the intuitive powers of even\nthis Court\u2019s greatest Justices.6 And to think that the\nHouse and the President also had this rejection firmly in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The Court asserts that \u201cit cannot be said that the changes to subsec\n\ntion (h)(2) were inconsequential,\u201d ante, at 15, n. 10, but the Court\u2019s sole\nevidence is the self-serving floor statements that it selectively cites.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           15\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmind is absurd. As always\u2014but especially in the context\nof strident, partisan legislative conflict of the sort that\ncharacterized enactment of this legislation\u2014the language\nof the statute that was actually passed by both Houses of\nCongress and signed by the President is our only authori\ntative and only reliable guidepost.\n                              D\n   A final but powerful indication of the fact that the Court\nhas made a mess of this statute is the nature of the conse\nquences that ensue. Though this case concerns a habeas\napplication challenging a trial by military commission,\nDTA \u00a71005(e)(1) strips the courts of jurisdiction to hear or\nconsider any \u201capplication for a writ of habeas corpus filed\nby or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of\nDefense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\u201d The vast majority of\npending petitions, no doubt, do not relate to military\ncommissions at all, but to more commonly challenged\naspects of \u201cdetention\u201d such as the terms and conditions of\nconfinement. See Rasul v. Bush, 542 U. S. 466, 498 (2004)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting). The Solicitor General represents\nthat \u201c[h]abeas petitions have been filed on behalf of a\npurported 600 [Guantanamo Bay] detainees,\u201d including\none that \u201cseek[s] relief on behalf of every Guantanamo\ndetainee who has not already filed an action,\u201d Respon\ndents\u2019 Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction 20, n. 10\n(hereinafter Motion to Dismiss). The Court\u2019s interpreta\ntion transforms a provision abolishing jurisdiction over all\nGuantanamo-related habeas petitions into a provision that\nretains jurisdiction over cases sufficiently numerous to\nkeep the courts busy for years to come.\n                            II\n  Because I would hold that \u00a71005(e)(1) unambiguously\nterminates the jurisdiction of all courts to \u201chear or con\nsider\u201d pending habeas applications, I must confront peti\n16                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ntioner\u2019s arguments that the provision, so interpreted,\nviolates the Suspension Clause. This claim is easily dis\npatched. We stated in Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S.\n763, 768 (1950):\n     \u201cWe are cited to no instance where a court, in this or\n     any other country where the writ is known, has issued\n     it on behalf of an alien enemy who, at no relevant\n     time and in no stage of his captivity, has been within\n     its territorial jurisdiction. Nothing in the text of the\n     Constitution extends such a right, nor does anything\n     in our statutes.\u201d\nNotwithstanding the ill-considered dicta in the Court\u2019s\nopinion in Rasul, 542 U. S., at 480\u2013481, it is clear that\nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba, is outside the sovereign \u201cterrito\nrial jurisdiction\u201d of the United States. See id., at 500\u2013505\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting). Petitioner, an enemy alien de\ntained abroad, has no rights under the Suspension Clause.\n  But even if petitioner were fully protected by the\nClause, the DTA would create no suspension problem.\nThis Court has repeatedly acknowledged that \u201cthe substi\ntution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate\nnor ineffective to test the legality of a person\u2019s detention\ndoes not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas\ncorpus.\u201d Swain v. Pressley, 430 U. S. 372, 381 (1977); see\nalso INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 314, n. 38 (2006) (\u201cCon\ngress could, without raising any constitutional questions,\nprovide an adequate substitute through the courts of\nappeals\u201d).\n  Petitioner has made no showing that the postdecision\nexclusive review by the D. C. Circuit provided in\n\u00a71005(e)(3) is inadequate to test the legality of his trial by\nmilitary commission. His principal argument is that the\nexclusive-review provisions are inadequate because they\nforeclose review of the claims he raises here. Though\npetitioner\u2019s brief does not parse the statutory language,\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          17\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nhis argument evidently rests on an erroneously narrow\nreading of DTA \u00a71005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 119 Stat. 2743. That\nprovision grants the D. C. Circuit authority to review, \u201cto\nthe extent the Constitution and laws of the United States\nare applicable, whether the use of such standards and\nprocedures to reach the final decision is consistent with\nthe Constitution and laws of the United States.\u201d In the\nquoted text, the phrase \u201csuch standards and procedures\u201d\nrefers to \u201cthe standards and procedures specified in the\nmilitary order referred to in subparagraph (A),\u201d namely\n\u201cMilitary Commission Order No. 1, dated August 31, 2005\n(or any successor military order).\u201d DTA \u00a71005(e)(3)(D)(i),\n(e)(3)(A), ibid. This Military Commission Order (Order\nNo. 1) is the Department of Defense\u2019s fundamental imple\nmenting order for the President\u2019s order authorizing trials\nby military commission. Order No. 1 establishes commis\nsions, \u00a72; delineates their jurisdiction, \u00a73; provides for\ntheir officers, \u00a74(A); provides for their prosecution and\ndefense counsel, \u00a74(B), (C); lays out all their procedures,\nboth pretrial and trial, \u00a75(A)\u2013(P), \u00a76(A)\u2013(G); and provides\nfor posttrial military review through the Secretary of\nDefense and the President, \u00a76(H). In short, the \u201cstandards\nand procedures specified in\u201d Order No. 1 include every\naspect of the military commissions, including the fact of\ntheir existence and every respect in which they differ from\ncourts-martial. Petitioner\u2019s claims that the President\nlacks legal authority to try him before a military commis\nsion constitute claims that \u201cthe use of such standards and\nprocedures,\u201d as specified in Order No. 1, is \u201c[in]consistent\nwith the Constitution and laws of the United States,\u201d DTA\n\u00a71005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 119 Stat. 2743. The D. C. Circuit thus\nretains jurisdiction to consider these claims on postdeci\nsion review, and the Government does not dispute that the\nDTA leaves unaffected our certiorari jurisdiction under 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71254(1) to review the D. C. Circuit\u2019s decisions.\nMotion to Dismiss 16, n. 8. Thus, the DTA merely defers\n18                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nour jurisdiction to consider petitioner\u2019s claims; it does not\neliminate that jurisdiction. It constitutes neither an\n\u201cinadequate\u201d nor an \u201cineffective\u201d substitute for petitioner\u2019s\npending habeas application.7\n   Though it does not squarely address the issue, the Court\nhints ominously that \u201cthe Government\u2019s preferred read\ning\u201d would \u201crais[e] grave questions about Congress\u2019 au\nthority to impinge upon this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction,\nparticularly in habeas cases.\u201d Ante, at 10\u201311 (citing Ex\nparte Yerger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88072\"><a href=\"/opinion/88072/ex-parte-yerger/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1869); Felker v.

It is not clear how there\ncould be any such lurking questions, in light of the aptly\nnamed \u201cExceptions Clause\u201d of Article III, \u00a72, which, in\nmaking our appellate jurisdiction subject to \u201csuch Excep\ntions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall\nmake,\u201d explicitly permits exactly what Congress has done\nhere. But any doubt our prior cases might have created on\nthis score is surely chimerical in this case. As just noted,\nthe exclusive-review provisions provide a substitute for\nhabeas review adequate to satisfy the Suspension Clause,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 Petitioner also urges that he could be subject to indefinite delay if\n\nmilitary officials and the President are deliberately dilatory in review\ning the decision of his commission. In reviewing the constitutionality of\nlegislation, we generally presume that the Executive will implement its\nprovisions in good faith. And it is unclear in any event that delay\nwould inflict any injury on petitioner, who (after an adverse determina\ntion by his CSRT, see </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2368563\"><a href=\"/opinion/2368563/hamdan-v-rumsfeld/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Pressley, 430 U. S.\n372, 381 (1977). In an analogous context, we discounted the notion that\npostponement of relief until postconviction review inflicted any cogni\nzable injury on a serviceman charged before a military court-martial.\nSchlesinger v. Councilman, 420 U. S. 738, 754\u2013755 (1975); see also\nYounger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, 46 (1971).\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

Traditionally,\nequitable principles govern both the exercise of habeas\njurisdiction and the granting of the injunctive relief sought\nby petitioner. See Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 U. S.\n738, 754 (1975); Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S.\n305, 311 (1982). In light of Congress\u2019s provision of an\nalternate avenue for petitioner\u2019s claims in \u00a71005(e)(3),\nthose equitable principles counsel that we abstain from\nexercising jurisdiction in this case.\n   In requesting abstention, the Government relies princi\npally on Councilman, in which we abstained from consid\nering a serviceman\u2019s claim that his charge for marijuana\npossession was not sufficiently \u201cservice-connected\u201d to\ntrigger the subject-matter jurisdiction of the military\ncourts-martial. See 420 U. S., at 740, 758. Admittedly,\nCouncilman does not squarely control petitioner\u2019s case,\nbut it provides the closest analogue in our jurisprudence.\nAs the Court describes, ante, at 21, Councilman \u201cidenti\nfie[d] two considerations of comity that together favor[ed]\nabstention pending completion of ongoing court-martial\nproceedings against service personnel.\u201d But the Court\nerrs in finding these considerations inapplicable to this\ncase. Both of them, and a third consideration not empha\nsized in Councilman, all cut in favor of abstention here.\n   First, the Court observes that Councilman rested in\npart on the fact that \u201cmilitary discipline and, therefore,\nthe efficient operation of the Armed Forces are best served\n20                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nif the military justice system acts without regular inter\nference from civilian courts,\u201d and concludes that \u201cHamdan\nis not a member of our Nation\u2019s Armed Forces, so concerns\nabout military discipline do not apply.\u201d Ante, at 22. This\nis true enough. But for some reason, the Court fails to\nmake any inquiry into whether military commission trials\nmight involve other \u201cmilitary necessities\u201d or \u201cunique mili\ntary exigencies,\u201d 420 U. S., at 757, comparable in gravity\nto those at stake in Councilman. To put this in context:\nThe charge against the respondent in Councilman was the\noff-base possession and sale of marijuana while he was\nstationed in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, see id., at 739\u2013740. The\ncharge against the petitioner here is joining and actively\nabetting the murderous conspiracy that slaughtered thou\nsands of innocent American civilians without warning on\nSeptember 11, 2001. While Councilman held that the\nprosecution of the former charge involved \u201cmilitary neces\nsities\u201d counseling against our interference, the Court does\nnot even ponder the same question for the latter charge.\n   The reason for the Court\u2019s \u201cblinkered study\u201d of this\nquestion, ante, at 19, is not hard to fathom. The principal\nopinion on the merits makes clear that it does not believe\nthat the trials by military commission involve any \u201cmili\ntary necessity\u201d at all: \u201cThe charge\u2019s shortcomings . . . are\nindicative of a broader inability on the Executive\u2019s part\nhere to satisfy the most basic precondition . . . for estab\nlishment of military commissions: military necessity.\u201d\nAnte, at 48. This is quite at odds with the views on this\nsubject expressed by our political branches. Because of\n\u201cmilitary necessity,\u201d a joint session of Congress authorized\nthe President to \u201cuse all necessary and appropriate force,\u201d\nincluding military commissions, \u201cagainst those nations,\norganizations, or persons [such as petitioner] he deter\nmines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terror\nist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.\u201d Au\nthorization for Use of Military Force, \u00a72(a), 115 Stat. 224,\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

In\nkeeping with this authority, the President has determined\nthat \u201c[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and\nfor the effective conduct of military operations and preven\ntion of terrorist attacks, it is necessary for individuals\nsubject to this order . . . to be detained, and, when tried, to\nbe tried for violations of the laws of war and other appli\ncable laws by military tribunals.\u201d Military Order of Nov.\n13, 2001, 3 CFR \u00a7918(e) (2002). It is not clear where the\nCourt derives the authority\u2014or the audacity\u2014to contra\ndict this determination. If \u201cmilitary necessities\u201d relating\nto \u201cduty\u201d and \u201cdiscipline\u201d required abstention in Council\nman, supra, at 757, military necessities relating to the\ndisabling, deterrence, and punishment of the mass-\nmurdering terrorists of September 11 require abstention\nall the more here.\n   The Court further seeks to distinguish Councilman on\nthe ground that \u201cthe tribunal convened to try Hamdan is\nnot part of the integrated system of military courts, com\nplete with independent review panels, that Congress has\nestablished.\u201d Ante, at 22. To be sure, Councilman empha\nsized that \u201cCongress created an integrated system of\nmilitary courts and review procedures, a critical element\nof which is the Court of Military Appeals consisting of\ncivilian judges completely removed from all military influ\nence or persuasion, who would gain over time thorough\nfamiliarity with military problems.\u201d 420 U. S., at 758\n(internal quotation marks and footnote omitted). The\nCourt contrasts this \u201cintegrated system\u201d insulated from\nmilitary influence with the review scheme established by\nOrder No. 1, which \u201cprovides that appeal of a review\npanel\u2019s decision may be had only to the Secretary of De\nfense himself, \u00a76(H)(5), and then, finally, to the President,\n\u00a76(H)(6).\u201d Ante, at 23.\n   Even if we were to accept the Court\u2019s extraordinary\nassumption that the President \u201clack[s] the structural\n22                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ninsulation from military influence that characterizes the\nCourt of Appeals for the Armed Forces,\u201d ante, at 23,8 the\nCourt\u2019s description of the review scheme here is anachro\nnistic. As of December 30, 2005, the \u201cfina[l]\u201d review of\ndecisions by military commissions is now conducted by the\nD. C. Circuit pursuant to \u00a71005(e)(3) of the DTA, and by\nthis Court under 28 U. S. C. \u00a71254(1). This provision for\nreview by Article III courts creates, if anything, a review\nscheme more insulated from Executive control than that in\nCouncilman.9 At the time we decided Councilman, Con\ngress had not \u201cconferred on any Art[icle] III court jurisdic\ntion directly to review court-martial determinations.\u201d 420\nU. S., at 746. The final arbiter of direct appeals was the\nCourt of Military Appeals (now the Court of Appeals for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The  very purpose of Article II\u2019s creation of a civilian Commander in\nChief in the President of the United States was to generate \u201cstructural\ninsulation from military influence.\u201d See The Federalist No. 28 (A. Hamil\nton); id., No. 69 (same). We do not live under a military junta. It is a\ndisservice to both those in the Armed Forces and the President to suggest\nthat the President is subject to the undue control of the military.\n   9 In rejecting our analysis, the Court observes that appeals to the\n\nD. C. Circuit under subsection (e)(3) are discretionary, rather than as of\nright, when the military commission imposes a sentence less than 10\nyears\u2019 imprisonment, see ante, at 23, n. 19, 52\u201353; \u00a71005(e)(3)(B), 119\nStat. 2743. The relevance of this observation to the abstention question\nis unfathomable. The fact that Article III review is discretionary does\nnot mean that it lacks \u201cstructural insulation from military influence,\u201d\nante, at 23, and its discretionary nature presents no obstacle to the\ncourts\u2019 future review these cases.\n   The Court might more cogently have relied on the discretionary na\nture of review to argue that the statute provides an inadequate substi\ntute for habeas review under the Suspension Clause. See supra, at 16\u2013\n18. But this argument would have no force, even if all appeals to the\nD. C. Circuit were discretionary. The exercise of habeas jurisdiction\nhas traditionally been entirely a matter of the court\u2019s equitable discre\ntion, see Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 715\u2013718 (1993) (SCALIA,\nJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part), so the fact that habeas\njurisdiction is replaced by discretionary appellate review does not\nrender the substitution \u201cinadequate.\u201d Swain, 430 U.

See 10 U. S. C. \u00a7867(a)(2)\n(1970 ed.).\n  Moreover, a third consideration counsels strongly in\nfavor of abstention in this case. Councilman reasoned\nthat the \u201cconsiderations of comity, the necessity of respect\nfor coordinate judicial systems\u201d that motivated our deci\nsion in Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971), were inap\nplicable to courts-martial, because \u201cthe particular de\nmands of federalism are not implicated.\u201d 420 U. S., at\n756, 757. Though military commissions likewise do not\nimplicate \u201cthe particular demands of federalism,\u201d consid\nerations of interbranch comity at the federal level weigh\nheavily against our exercise of equity jurisdiction in this\ncase. Here, apparently for the first time in history, see\nMotion to Dismiss 6, a District Court enjoined ongoing\nmilitary commission proceedings, which had been deemed\n\u201cnecessary\u201d by the President \u201c[t]o protect the United\nStates and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of\nmilitary operations and prevention of terrorist attacks.\u201d\nMilitary Order of Nov. 13, 3 CFR \u00a7918(e). Such an order\nbrings the Judicial Branch into direct conflict with the\nExecutive in an area where the Executive\u2019s competence is\nmaximal and ours is virtually nonexistent. We should\nexercise our equitable discretion to avoid such conflict.\nInstead, the Court rushes headlong to meet it. Elsewhere,\nwe have deferred exercising habeas jurisdiction until state\ncourts have \u201cthe first opportunity to review\u201d a petitioner\u2019s\nclaim, merely to \u201creduc[e] friction between the state and\nfederal court systems.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U. S.\n838, 844, 845 (1999). The \u201cfriction\u201d created today between\nthis Court and the Executive Branch is many times more\nserious.\n  In the face of such concerns, the Court relies heavily on\n24                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nEx parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942): \u201cFar from abstaining\npending the conclusion of military proceedings, which\nwere ongoing, [in Quirin] we convened a special Term to\nhear the case and expedited our review.\u201d Ante, at 24. It is\nlikely that the Government in Quirin, unlike here, pre\nferred a hasty resolution of the case in this Court, so that\nit could swiftly execute the sentences imposed, see Hamdi\nv. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 569 (2004) (SCALIA, J., dissent\ning). But the Court\u2019s reliance on Quirin suffers from a\nmore fundamental defect: Once again, it ignores the DTA,\nwhich creates an avenue for the consideration of peti\ntioner\u2019s claims that did not exist at the time of Quirin.\nCollateral application for habeas review was the only\nvehicle available. And there was no compelling reason to\npostpone consideration of the Quirin application until the\ntermination of military proceedings, because the only\ncognizable claims presented were general challenges to the\nauthority of the commissions that would not be affected by\nthe specific proceedings. See supra, at 8\u20139, n. 2. In the\nDTA, by contrast, Congress has expanded the scope of\nArticle III review and has channeled it exclusively through\na single, postverdict appeal to Article III courts. Because\nCongress has created a novel unitary scheme of Article III\nreview of military commissions that was absent in 1942,\nQuirin is no longer governing precedent.\n   I would abstain from exercising our equity jurisdiction,\nas the Government requests.\n                        *    *      * \n\n     For the foregoing reasons, I dissent. \n\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

The Court having\nconcluded otherwise, it is appropriate to respond to the\nCourt\u2019s resolution of the merits of petitioner\u2019s claims\nbecause its opinion openly flouts our well-established duty\nto respect the Executive\u2019s judgment in matters of military\noperations and foreign affairs. The Court\u2019s evident belief\nthat it is qualified to pass on the \u201c[m]ilitary necessity,\u201d\nante, at 48, of the Commander in Chief\u2019s decision to em\nploy a particular form of force against our enemies is so\nantithetical to our constitutional structure that it simply\ncannot go unanswered. I respectfully dissent.\n                              I\n  Our review of petitioner\u2019s claims arises in the context of\nthe President\u2019s wartime exercise of his commander-in\nchief authority in conjunction with the complete support of\nCongress. Accordingly, it is important to take measure of\nthe respective roles the Constitution assigns to the three\nbranches of our Government in the conduct of war.\n  As I explained in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507\n2                   HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n(2004), the structural advantages attendant to the Execu\ntive Branch\u2014namely, the decisiveness, \u201c \u2018activity, secrecy,\nand dispatch\u2019 \u201d that flow from the Executive\u2019s \u201c \u2018unity,\u2019 \u201d id.,\nat 581 (dissenting opinion) (quoting The Federalist No. 70,\np. 472 (J.

II, \u00a71, provides that he \u201cshall be Com\nmander in Chief\u201d of the Armed Forces, \u00a72, and places in\nhim the power to recognize foreign governments, \u00a73. This\nCourt has observed that these provisions confer upon the\nPresident broad constitutional authority to protect the\nNation\u2019s security in the manner he deems fit.

Accordingly, in the very context that we\naddress today, this Court has concluded that \u201cthe deten\ntion and trial of petitioners\u2014ordered by the President in\nthe declared exercise of his powers as Commander in Chief\nof the Army in time of war and of grave public danger\u2014\nare not to be set aside by the courts without the clear\nconviction that they are in conflict with the Constitution\nor laws of Congress constitutionally enacted.\u201d Ex parte\nQuirin, 317 U.

As a plurality of\nthe Court observed in Hamdi, the \u201ccapture, detention, and\ntrial of unlawful combatants, by \u2018universal agreement and\npractice,\u2019 are \u2018important incident[s] of war,\u2019 \u201d Hamdi, 542\nU. S., at 518 (quoting Quirin, supra, at 28, 30; emphasis\nadded), and are therefore \u201can exercise of the \u2018necessary\nand appropriate force\u2019 Congress has authorized the Presi\ndent to use.\u201d Hamdi, 542 U. S., at 518; id., at 587 (THO\nMAS, J., dissenting). Hamdi\u2019s observation that military\ncommissions are included within the AUMF\u2019s authoriza\ntion is supported by this Court\u2019s previous recognition that\n\u201c[a]n important incident to the conduct of war is the adop\ntion of measures by the military commander, not only to\nrepel and defeat the enemy, but to seize and subject to\ndisciplinary measures those enemies who, in their attempt\nto thwart or impede our military effort, have violated the\nlaw of war.\u201d In re Yamashita, 327 U. S. 1, 11 (1946); see\nalso Quirin, supra, at 28\u201329; Madsen v. Kinsella, 343 U. S.\n341, 354, n. 20 (1952) (\u201c \u2018[T]he military commission . . . is\nan institution of the greatest importance in the period of\nwar and should be preserved\u2019 \u201d (quoting S. Rep.

Instead, the Court determines the scope of this power\nbased exclusively on Article 21 of the Uniform Code of\nMilitary Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S. C. \u00a7821, the successor to\nArticle 15 of the Articles of War, which Quirin held \u201cau\nthorized trial of offenses against the law of war before\n[military] commissions.\u201d 317 U.

Accordingly, congressional au\nthorization for military commissions pertaining to the\ninstant conflict derives not only from Article 21 of the\nUCMJ, but also from the more recent, and broader, au\nthorization contained in the AUMF.2\n   I note the Court\u2019s error respecting the AUMF not be\ncause it is necessary to my resolution of this case\u2014\nHamdan\u2019s military commission can plainly be sustained\nsolely under Article 21\u2014but to emphasize the complete\ncongressional sanction of the President\u2019s exercise of his\ncommander-in-chief authority to conduct the present war.\nIn such circumstances, as previously noted, our duty to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 As previously noted, Article 15 of the Articles of War was the prede\n\ncessor of Article 21 of the UCMJ. Article 21 provides as follows: \u201cThe\nprovisions of this chapter conferring jurisdiction upon courts-martial do\nnot deprive military commissions, provost courts, or other military\ntribunals of concurrent jurisdiction with respect to offenders or offenses\nthat by statute or by the law of war may be tried by military commis\nsions, provost courts, or other military tribunals.\u201d 10 U. S. C. \u00a7821.\n   2 Although the President very well may have inherent authority to try\n\nunlawful combatants for violations of the law of war before military\ncommissions, we need not decide that question because Congress has\nauthorized the President to do so. Cf. Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S.\n507, 587 (2004) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (same conclusion respecting\ndetention of unlawful combatants).\n6                   HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ndefer to the Executive\u2019s military and foreign policy judg\nment is at its zenith; it does not countenance the kind of\nsecond-guessing the Court repeatedly engages in today.\nMilitary and foreign policy judgments\n    \u201c \u2018are and should be undertaken only by those directly\n    responsible to the people whose welfare they advance\n    or imperil. They are decisions of a kind for which the\n    Judiciary has neither aptitude, facilities nor responsi\n    bility and which has long been held to belong in the\n    domain of political power not subject to judicial intru\n    sion or inquiry.\u2019 \u201d Hamdi, supra, at 582\u2013583 (THOMAS,\n    J., dissenting) (quoting Chicago & Southern Air Lines,\n    Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 111 (1948)).\nIt is within this framework that the lawfulness of Ham\ndan\u2019s commission should be examined.\n                               II\n   The plurality accurately describes some aspects of the\nhistory of military commissions and the prerequisites for\ntheir use. Thus, I do not dispute that military commis\nsions have historically been \u201cused in three [different]\nsituations,\u201d ante, at 31\u201332, and that the only situation\nrelevant to the instant case is the use of military commis\nsions \u201c \u2018to seize and subject to disciplinary measures those\nenemies who . . . have violated the law of war,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 32\n(quoting Quirin, supra, at 28\u201329). Similarly, I agree with\nthe plurality that Winthrop\u2019s treatise sets forth the four\nrelevant considerations for determining the scope of a\nmilitary commission\u2019s jurisdiction, considerations relating\nto the (1) time and (2) place of the offense, (3) the status of\nthe offender, and (4) the nature of the offense charged.\nWinthrop 836\u2013840. The Executive has easily satisfied\nthese considerations here. The plurality\u2019s contrary con\nclusion rests upon an incomplete accounting and an un\nfaithful application of those considerations.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                               A\n   The first two considerations are that a law-of-war mili\ntary commission may only assume jurisdiction of \u201coffences\ncommitted within the field of the command of the conven\ning commander,\u201d and that such offenses \u201cmust have been\ncommitted within the period of the war.\u201d See id., at 836,\n837; ante, at 33. Here, as evidenced by Hamdan\u2019s charg\ning document, the Executive has determined that the\ntheater of the present conflict includes \u201cAfghanistan,\nPakistan and other countries\u201d where al Qaeda has estab\nlished training camps, App. to Pet. for Cert. 64a, and that\nthe duration of that conflict dates back (at least) to Usama\nbin Laden\u2019s August 1996 \u201cDeclaration of Jihad Against the\nAmericans,\u201d ibid. Under the Executive\u2019s description of the\nconflict, then, every aspect of the charge, which alleges\novert acts in \u201cAfghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen and other\ncountries\u201d taking place from 1996 to 2001, satisfies the\ntemporal and geographic prerequisites for the exercise of\nlaw-of-war military commission jurisdiction. Id., at 65a\u2013\n67a. And these judgments pertaining to the scope of the\ntheater and duration of the present conflict are committed\nsolely to the President in the exercise of his commander-\nin-chief authority. See Prize Cases, 2 Black, at 670 (con\ncluding that the President\u2019s commander-in-chief judgment\nabout the nature of a particular conflict was \u201ca question to\nbe decided by him, and this Court must be governed by the\ndecisions and acts of the political department of the Gov\nernment to which this power was entrusted\u201d).\n   Nevertheless, the plurality concludes that the legality of\nthe charge against Hamdan is doubtful because \u201cHamdan\nis charged not with an overt act for which he was caught\nredhanded in a theater of war . . . but with an agreement\nthe inception of which long predated . . . the [relevant\narmed conflict].\u201d Ante, at 48 (emphasis in original). The\nplurality\u2019s willingness to second-guess the Executive\u2019s judg\nments in this context, based upon little more than its un\n8                      HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsupported assertions, constitutes an unprecedented depar\nture from the traditionally limited role of the courts with\nrespect to war and an unwarranted intrusion on executive\nauthority. And even if such second-guessing were appropri\nate, the plurality\u2019s attempt to do so is unpersuasive.\n   As an initial matter, the plurality relies upon the date of\nthe AUMF\u2019s enactment to determine the beginning point\nfor the \u201cperiod of the war,\u201d Winthrop 836, thereby suggest\ning that petitioner\u2019s commission does not have jurisdiction\nto try him for offenses committed prior to the AUMF\u2019s\nenactment. Ante, at 34\u201336, 48. But this suggestion be\ntrays the plurality\u2019s unfamiliarity with the realities of\nwarfare and its willful blindness to our precedents. The\nstarting point of the present conflict (or indeed any con\nflict) is not determined by congressional enactment, but\nrather by the initiation of hostilities. See Prize Cases,\nsupra, at 668 (recognizing that war may be initiated by\n\u201cinvasion of a foreign nation,\u201d and that such initiation, and\nthe President\u2019s response, usually precedes congressional\naction). Thus, Congress\u2019 enactment of the AUMF did not\nmark the beginning of this Nation\u2019s conflict with al Qaeda,\nbut instead authorized the President to use force in the\nmidst of an ongoing conflict. Moreover, while the Presi\ndent\u2019s \u201cwar powers\u201d may not have been activated until the\nAUMF was passed, ante, 35, n. 31, the date of such activa\ntion has never been used to determine the scope of a mili\ntary commission\u2019s jurisdiction.3 Instead, the traditional\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Even if the formal declaration of war were generally the determina\n\ntive act in ascertaining the temporal reach of the jurisdiction of a\nmilitary commission, the AUMF itself is inconsistent with the plural\nity\u2019s suggestion that such a rule is appropriate in this case. See ante, at\n34\u201336, 48. The text of the AUMF is backward looking, authorizing the\nuse of \u201call necessary and appropriate force against those nations,\norganizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, commit\nted, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11,\n2001.\u201d Thus, the President\u2019s decision to try Hamdan by military\ncommission\u2014a use of force authorized by the AUMF\u2014for Hamdan\u2019s\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

In fact, bringing the Septem\nber 11 conspirators to justice is the primary point of the AUMF. By\ncontrast, on the plurality\u2019s logic, the AUMF would not grant the Presi\ndent the authority to try Usama bin Laden himself for his involvement\nin the events of September 11, 2001.\n   4 The plurality suggests these authorities are inapplicable because\n\nnothing in its \u201canalysis turns on the admitted absence of either a\nformal declaration of war or a declaration of martial law. Our focus\ninstead is on the . . . AUMF.\u201d Ante, at 35, n. 31. The difference identi\nfied by the plurality is purely semantic. Both Green and Howland\nconfirm that the date of the enactment that establishes a legal basis for\nforming military commissions\u2014whether it be a declaration of war, a\ndeclaration of martial law, or an authorization to use military force\u2014\ndoes not limit the jurisdiction of military commissions to offenses\ncommitted after that date.\n   5 The plurality attempts to evade the import of this historical example\n\nby observing that Kuehn was tried before a martial law commission for\n10                       HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                           THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n  Moreover, the President\u2019s determination that the pre\nsent conflict dates at least to 1996 is supported by over\nwhelming evidence. According to the State Department,\nal Qaeda declared war on the United States as early as\nAugust 1996. See Dept. of State Fact Sheet: Usama bin\nLadin (Aug. 21, 1998); Dept. of State Fact Sheet: The\nCharges against International Terrorist Usama Bin Laden\n(Dec. 20, 2000); cf. Prize Cases, 2 Black, at 668 (recogniz\ning that a state of war exists even if \u201cthe declaration of it\nbe unilateral\u201d (emphasis in original)). In February 1998,\nal Qaeda leadership issued another statement ordering\nthe indiscriminate\u2014and, even under the laws of war as\napplied to legitimate nation-states, plainly illegal\u2014killing\nof American civilians and military personnel alike. See\nJihad Against Jews and Crusaders: World Islamic Front\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\na violation of federal espionage statutes. Ibid. As an initial matter, the\nfact that Kuehn was tried before a martial law commission for an\noffense committed prior to the establishment of martial law provides\nstrong support for the President\u2019s contention that he may try Hamdan\nfor offenses committed prior to the enactment of the AUMF. Here the\nAUMF serves the same function as the declaration of martial law in\nHawaii in 1941, establishing legal authority for the constitution of\nmilitary commissions. Moreover, Kuehn was not tried and punished\n\u201cby statute, but by the laws and usages of war.\u201d United States v.\nBernard Julius Otto Kuehn, Board of Review 5 (Office of the Military\nGovernor, Hawaii 1942). Indeed, in upholding the imposition of the\ndeath penalty, a sentence \u201cnot authorized by the Espionage statutes,\u201d\nibid., Kuehn\u2019s Board of Review explained that \u201c[t]he fact that persons\nmay be tried and punished . . . by a military commission for committing\nacts defined as offenses by . . . federal statutes does not mean that such\npersons are being tried for violations of such . . . statutes; they are,\ninstead, being tried for acts made offenses only by orders of the . . .\ncommanding general.\u201d Id., at 6. Lastly, the import of this example is\nnot undermined by Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 327 U. S. 304 (1946). The\nquestion before the Court in that case involved only whether \u201cloyal\ncivilians in loyal territory should have their daily conduct governed by\nmilitary orders,\u201d id., at 319; it did \u201cnot involve the well-established power\nof the military to exercise jurisdiction over . . . enemy belligerents,\u201d id., at\n313.\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

Swet\nnam, Usama bin Laden\u2019s al-Qaida: Profile of a Terrorist\nNetwork, App. 1B (2001) (\u201cThe ruling to kill the Ameri\ncans and their allies\u2014civilians and military\u2014is an indi\nvidual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country\nin which it is possible to do it\u201d). This was not mere rheto\nric; even before September 11, 2001, al Qaeda was in\nvolved in the bombing of the World Trade Center in New\nYork City in 1993, the bombing of the Khobar Towers in\nSaudi Arabia in 1996, the bombing of the U.

Based on the foregoing, the President\u2019s judgment\u2014\nthat the present conflict substantially predates the AUMF,\nextending at least as far back as al Qaeda\u2019s 1996 declara\ntion of war on our Nation, and that the theater of war\nextends at least as far as the localities of al Qaeda\u2019s prin\ncipal bases of operations\u2014is beyond judicial reproach.\nAnd the plurality\u2019s unsupportable contrary determination\nmerely confirms that \u201c \u2018the Judiciary has neither aptitude,\nfacilities nor responsibility\u2019 \u201d for making military or foreign\naffairs judgments.

Law-of-war military commis\nsions have jurisdiction over \u201c \u2018individuals of the enemy\u2019s\narmy who have been guilty of illegitimate warfare or other\noffences in violation of the laws of war,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 33-34\n12                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n(quoting Winthrop 838). They also have jurisdiction over\n\u201c[i]rregular armed bodies or persons not forming part of\nthe organized forces of a belligerent\u201d \u201cwho would not be\nlikely to respect the laws of war.\u201d Id., at 783, 784. Indeed,\naccording to Winthrop, such persons are not \u201cwithin the\nprotection of the laws of war\u201d and were \u201cliable to be shot,\nimprisoned, or banished, either summarily where their\nguilt was clear or upon trial and conviction by military\ncommission.\u201d Id., at 784. This consideration is easily satis\nfied here, as Hamdan is an unlawful combatant charged\nwith joining and conspiring with a terrorist network dedi\ncated to flouting the laws of war. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2368563\"><a href=\"/opinion/2368563/hamdan-v-rumsfeld/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In contrast to the preceding\nconsiderations, this Court\u2019s precedents establish that\njudicial review of \u201cwhether any of the acts charged is an\noffense against the law of war cognizable before a military\ntribunal\u201d is appropriate.

Gen.\n297, 310 (1865). Moreover, the common law of war is\nmarked by two important features. First, as with the\ncommon law generally, it is flexible and evolutionary in\nnature, building upon the experience of the past and\ntaking account of the exigencies of the present. Thus,\n\u201c[t]he law of war, like every other code of laws, declares\nwhat shall not be done, and does not say what may be\ndone. The legitimate use of the great power of war, or\nrather the prohibitions upon the use of that power, in\ncrease or diminish as the necessity of the case demands.\u201d\nId., at 300. Accordingly, this Court has recognized that\nthe \u201cjurisdiction\u201d of \u201cour common-law war courts\u201d has not\nbeen \u201cprescribed by statute,\u201d but rather \u201chas been adapted\nin each instance to the need that called it forth.\u201d Madsen,\n343 U. S., at 346\u2013348. Second, the common law of war\naffords a measure of respect for the judgment of military\ncommanders. Thus, \u201c[t]he commander of an army in time\nof war has the same power to organize military tribunals\nand execute their judgments that he has to set his squad\nrons in the field and fight battles. His authority in each\ncase is from the law and usage of war.\u201d 11 Op. Atty. Gen.,\nat 305. In recognition of these principles, Congress has\ngenerally \u201c \u2018left it to the President, and the military com\nmanders representing him, to employ the commission, as\noccasion may require, for the investigation and punish\nment of violations of the law of war.\u2019 \u201d Madsen, supra, at\n347, n. 9 (quoting Winthrop 831; emphasis added).\n   In one key respect, the plurality departs from the proper\nframework for evaluating the adequacy of the charge\nagainst Hamdan under the laws of war. The plurality\nholds that where, as here, \u201cneither the elements of the\noffense nor the range of permissible punishments is de\nfined by statute or treaty, the precedent [establishing\nwhether an offense is triable by military commission]\n14                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nmust be plain and unambiguous.\u201d Ante, at 38. This is a\npure contrivance, and a bad one at that. It is contrary to\nthe presumption we acknowledged in Quirin, namely, that\nthe actions of military commissions are \u201cnot to be set aside\nby the courts without the clear conviction that they are\u201d\nunlawful, 317 U. S., at 25 (emphasis added). It is also\ncontrary to Yamashita, which recognized the legitimacy of\nthat military commission notwithstanding a substantial\ndisagreement pertaining to whether Yamashita had been\ncharged with a violation of the law of war. Compare 327\nU. S., at 17 (noting that the allegations were \u201cadequat[e]\u201d\nand \u201cneed not be stated with . . . precision\u201d), with id., at 35\n(Murphy, J., dissenting) (arguing that the charge was\ninadequate). Nor does it find support from the separation\nof powers authority cited by the plurality. Indeed, Madi\nson\u2019s praise of the separation of powers in The Federalist\nNo. 47, quoted ante, at 38-39, if it has any relevance at all,\nmerely highlights the illegitimacy of today\u2019s judicial intru\nsion onto core executive prerogatives in the waging of war,\nwhere executive competence is at its zenith and judicial\ncompetence at its nadir.\n  The plurality\u2019s newly minted clear-statement rule is also\nfundamentally inconsistent with the nature of the common\nlaw which, by definition, evolves and develops over time\nand does not, in all cases, \u201csay what may be done.\u201d 11 Op.\nAtty. Gen., at 300. Similarly, it is inconsistent with the\nnature of warfare, which also evolves and changes over\ntime, and for which a flexible, evolutionary common-law\nsystem is uniquely appropriate.6 Though the charge\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Indeed, respecting the present conflict, the President has found that\n\n\u201cthe war against terrorism ushers in a new paradigm, one in which\ngroups with broad, international reach commit horrific acts against\ninnocent civilians, sometimes with the direct support of states. Our\nNation recognizes that this new paradigm\u2014ushered in not by us, but\nby terrorists\u2014requires new thinking in the law of war.\u201d App. 34\u201335.\nUnder the Court\u2019s approach, the President\u2019s ability to address this \u201cnew\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

We should undertake to deter\nmine whether an unlawful combatant has been charged\nwith an offense against the law of war with an under\nstanding that the common law of war is flexible, respon\nsive to the exigencies of the present conflict, and deferen\ntial to the judgment of military commanders.\n                              1\n   Under either the correct, flexible approach to evaluating\nthe adequacy of Hamdan\u2019s charge, or under the plurality\u2019s\nnew, clear-statement approach, Hamdan has been charged\nwith conduct constituting two distinct violations of the law\nof war cognizable before a military commission: member\nship in a war-criminal enterprise and conspiracy to com\nmit war crimes. The charging section of the indictment\nalleges both that Hamdan \u201cwillfully and knowingly joined\nan enterprise of persons who shared a common criminal\npurpose,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a, and that he \u201cconspired\nand agreed with [al Qaeda] to commit . . . offenses triable\nby military commission,\u201d ibid.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nparadigm\u201d of inflicting death and mayhem would be completely frozen\nby rules developed in the context of conventional warfare.\n  7 It is true that both of these separate offenses are charged under a\n\nsingle heading entitled \u201cCHARGE: CONSPIRACY,\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 65a. But that does not mean that they must be treated as a single\ncrime, when the law of war treats them as separate crimes. As we\nacknowledged in In re Yamashita, 327 U. S. 1 (1946), \u201ccharges of\nviolations of the law of war triable before a military tribunal need not\nbe stated with the precision of a common law indictment.\u201d Id., at 17; cf.\nW. Birkhimer, Military Government and Martial Law 536 (3d ed. 1914)\n(hereinafter Birkhimer) (\u201c[I]t would be extremely absurd to expect the\nsame precision in a charge brought before a court-martial as is required to\nsupport a conviction before a justice of the peace\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n16                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   The common law of war establishes that Hamdan\u2019s\nwillful and knowing membership in al Qaeda is a war\ncrime chargeable before a military commission. Hamdan,\na confirmed enemy combatant and member or affiliate of\nal Qaeda, has been charged with willfully and knowingly\njoining a group (al Qaeda) whose purpose is \u201cto support\nviolent attacks against property and nationals (both mili\ntary and civilian) of the United States.\u201d Id., at 64a; 344 F.\nSupp. 2d, at 161. Moreover, the allegations specify that\nHamdan joined and maintained his relationship with al\nQaeda even though he \u201cbelieved that Usama bin Laden\nand his associates were involved in the attacks on the\nU. S. Embassies in Kenya and Tazania in August 1998,\nthe attack on the USS COLE in October 2000, and the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   Nevertheless, the plurality contends that Hamdan was \u201cnot actually\ncharged,\u201d ante, at 37, n. 32 (emphasis deleted), with being a member in\na war criminal organization. But that position is demonstrably wrong.\nHamdan\u2019s charging document expressly charges that he \u201cwillfully and\nknowingly joined an enterprise of persons who shared a common\ncriminal purpose.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a. Moreover, the plurality\u2019s\ncontention that we may only look to the label affixed to the charge to\ndetermine if the charging document alleges an offense triable by\nmilitary commission is flatly inconsistent with its treatment of the Civil\nWar cases\u2014where it accepts as valid charges that did not appear in the\nheading or title of the charging document, or even the listed charge\nitself, but only in the supporting specification. See, e.g., ante, at 45\u201346\n(discussing the military commission trial of Wirz). For example, in the\nWirz case, Wirz was charged with conspiring to violate the laws of war,\nand that charge was supported with allegations that he personally\ncommitted a number of atrocities. The plurality concludes that military\ncommission jurisdiction was appropriate in that case not based upon\nthe charge of conspiracy, but rather based upon the allegations of\nvarious atrocities in the specification which were not separately\ncharged. Ante, at 45. Just as these atrocities, not separately charged,\nwere independent violations of the law of war supporting Wirz\u2019s trial by\nmilitary commission, so too here Hamdan\u2019s membership in al Qaeda\nand his provision of various forms of assistance to al Qaeda\u2019s top\nleadership are independent violations of the law of war supporting his\ntrial by military commission.\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

These allegations, against a\nconfirmed unlawful combatant, are alone sufficient to\nsustain the jurisdiction of Hamdan\u2019s military commission.\n  For well over a century it has been established that \u201cto\nunite with banditti, jayhawkers, guerillas, or any other\nunauthorized marauders is a high offence against the laws\nof war; the offence is complete when the band is organized\nor joined. The atrocities committed by such a band do not\nconstitute the offence, but make the reasons, and sufficient\nreasons they are, why such banditti are denounced by the\nlaws of war.\u201d 11 Op. Atty. Gen., at 312 (emphasis added).8\nIn other words, unlawful combatants, such as Hamdan,\nviolate the law of war merely by joining an organization,\nsuch as al Qaeda, whose principal purpose is the \u201ckilling\n[and] disabling . . . of peaceable citizens or soldiers.\u201d\nWinthrop 784; see also 11 Op.

Indeed, in the highest profile case\nto be tried before a military commission relating to that\nwar, namely, the trial of the men involved in the assassi\nnation of President Lincoln, the charge provided that those\nmen had \u201ccombin[ed], confederat[ed], and conspir[ed] . . . to\nkill and murder\u201d President Lincoln.

No. 356).12\n   In addition to the foregoing high-profile example, Win\nthrop\u2019s treatise enumerates numerous Civil War military\ncommission trials for conspiracy to violate the law of war.\nWinthrop 839, n. 5. The plurality attempts to explain\nthese examples away by suggesting that the conspiracies\nlisted by Winthrop are best understood as \u201ca species of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 The plurality concludes that military commission jurisdiction was\n\nappropriate in the case of the Lincoln conspirators because they were\ncharged with \u201c \u2018maliciously, unlawfully, and traitorously murdering the\nsaid Abraham Lincoln,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 40, n. 35. But the sole charge filed in\nthat case alleged conspiracy, and the allegations pertaining to \u201cmali\nciously, unlawfully, and traitorously murdering the said Abraham\nLincoln\u201d were not charged or labeled as separate offenses, but rather as\novert acts \u201cin pursuance of and in prosecuting said malicious, unlawful,\nand traitorous conspiracy. \u201d G. C. M. O. No. 356, at ___ (emphasis\nadded). While the plurality contends the murder of President Lincoln\nwas charged as a distinct separate offense, the foregoing quoted lan\nguage of the charging document unequivocally establishes otherwise.\nMoreover, though I agree that the allegations pertaining to these overt\nacts provided an independent basis for the military commission\u2019s\njurisdiction in that case, that merely confirms the propriety of examin\ning all the acts alleged\u2014whether or not they are labeled as separate\noffenses\u2014to determine if a defendant has been charged with a violation\nof the law of war. As I have already explained, Hamdan has been\ncharged with violating the law of war not only by participating in a\nconspiracy to violate the law of war, but also by joining a war criminal\nenterprise and by supplying provisions and assistance to that enter\nprise\u2019s top leadership.\n24                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncompound offense,\u201d namely, violations both of the law of\nwar and ordinary criminal laws, rather than \u201cstand-alone\noffense[s] against the law of war.\u201d Ante, at 44\u201345 (citing,\nas an example, murder in violation of the laws of war).\nBut the fact that, for example, conspiracy to commit mur\nder can at the same time violate ordinary criminal laws\nand the law of war, so that it is \u201ca combination of the two\nspecies of offenses,\u201d Howland 1071, does not establish that\na military commission would not have jurisdiction to try\nthat crime solely on the basis that it was a violation of the\nlaw of war. Rather, if anything, and consistent with the\nprinciple that the common law of war is flexible and af\nfords some level of deference to the judgments of military\ncommanders, it establishes that military commissions\nwould have the discretion to try the offense as (1) one\nagainst the law of war, or (2) one against the ordinary\ncriminal laws, or (3) both.\n  In any event, the plurality\u2019s effort to avoid the import of\nWinthrop\u2019s footnote through the smokescreen of its \u201ccom\npound offense\u201d theory, ante, at 44\u201345, cannot be reconciled\nwith the particular charges that sustained military com\nmission jurisdiction in the cases that Winthrop cites. For\nexample, in the military commission trial of Henry Wirtz,\nCharge I provided that he had been\n     \u201c[m]aliciously, willfully, and traitorously . . . combin\n     ing, confederating, and conspiring, together [with\n     various other named and unnamed co-conspirators],\n     to injure the health and destroy the lives of soldiers in\n     the military service of the United States, then held\n     and being prisoners of war within the lines of the so-\n     called Confederate States, and in the military prisons\n     thereof, to the end that the armies of the United\n     States might be weakened and impaired, in violation\n     of the laws and customs of war.\u201d G.

The plurality suggests the Wirz case is not relevant\nbecause the specification supporting his conspiracy charge alleged that\nhe \u201cpersonally committed a number of atrocities.\u201d Ante, at 45. But this\ndoes not establish that conspiracy to violate the laws of war, the very\ncrime with which Wirz was charged, is not itself a violation of the law\nof war. Rather, at best, it establishes that in addition to conspiracy\nWirz violated the laws of war by committing various atrocities, just as\nHamdan violated the laws of war not only by conspiring to do so, but\nalso by joining al Qaeda and providing provisions and services to its top\nleadership. Moreover, the fact that Wirz was charged with overt acts\nthat are more severe than the overt acts with which Hamdan has been\ncharged does not establish that conspiracy is not an offense cognizable\nbefore military commission; rather it merely establishes that Wirz\u2019s\noffenses may have been comparably worse than Hamdan\u2019s offenses.\n   The plurality\u2019s claim that the charge against Lenger Grenfel supports\nits compound offense theory is similarly unsupportable. The plurality\ndoes not, and cannot, dispute that Grenfel was charged with conspiring\nto violate the laws of war by releasing rebel prisoners\u2014a charge that\nbears no relation to a crime \u201cordinarily triable in civilian courts.\u201d Ante,\nat 46, n. 37. Tellingly, the plurality does not reference or discuss this\ncharge, but instead refers to the conclusion of Judge Advocate Holt that\nGrenfel also \u201c \u2018united himself with traitors and malefactors for the\noverthrow of our Republic in the interest of slavery.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting\nH. R. Doc. No. 314, at 689). But Judge Advocate Holt\u2019s observation\nprovides no support for the plurality\u2019s conclusion, as it does not discuss\nthe charges that sustained military commission jurisdiction, much less\nsuggest that such charges were not violations of the law of war.\n26                     HAMDAN v.

These examples provide incontro\nvertible support for the President\u2019s conclusion that the\ncommon law of war permits military commission trials for\nconspiracy to violate the law of war. And they specifically\ncontradict the plurality\u2019s conclusion to the contrary,\nthereby easily satisfying its requirement that the Gov\nernment \u201cmake a substantial showing that the crime for\nwhich it seeks to try a defendant by military commission\nis acknowledged to be an offense against the law of war.\u201d\nAnte, at 39-40.14\n   The plurality further contends, in reliance upon Win\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   14 The plurality contends that international practice\u2014including the\n\npractice of the IMT at Nuremberg\u2014supports its conclusion that con\nspiracy is not an offense triable by military commission because \u201c \u2018[t]he\nAnglo-American concept of conspiracy was not part of European legal\nsystems and arguably not an element of the internationally recognized\nlaws of war.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 47 (quoting T. Taylor, Anatomy of the Nurem\nberg Trials: A Personal Memoir 36 (1992)). But while the IMT did not\ncriminalize all conspiracies to violate the law of war, it did criminalize\n\u201cparticipation in a common plan or conspiracy\u201d to wage aggressive war.\nSee 1 Trials, pp. XI\u2013XII. Moreover, the World War II military tribunals\nof several European nations recognized conspiracy to violate the laws of\nwar as an offense triable before military commissions. See 15 U. N.\nCommission 90\u201391 (noting that the French Military Tribunal at Mar\nseilles found Henri Georges Stadelhofer \u201cguilty of the crime of associa\ntion de malfaiteurs,\u201d namely of \u201chaving formed with various members of\nthe German Gestapo an association with the aim of preparing or\ncommitting crimes against persons or property, without justification\nunder the laws and usages of war\u201d); 11 id., at 98 (noting that the\nNetherlands\u2019 military tribunals were authorized to try conspiracy to\nviolate the laws of war). Thus, the European legal systems\u2019 approach to\ndomestic conspiracy law has not prevented European nations from\nrecognizing conspiracy offenses as violations of the law of war. This is\nunsurprising, as the law of war is derived not from domestic law but\nfrom the wartime practices of civilized nations, including the United\nStates, which has consistently recognized that conspiracy to violate the\nlaws of war is an offense triable by military commission.\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            27\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthrop, that conspiracy is not an offense cognizable before a\nlaw-of-war military commission because \u201cit is not enough\nto intend to violate the law of war and commit overt acts\nin furtherance of that intention unless the overt acts\neither are themselves offenses against the law of war or\nconstitute steps sufficiently substantial to qualify as an\nattempt.\u201d Ibid. But Winthrop does not support the plural\nity\u2019s conclusion. The passage in Winthrop cited by the\nplurality states only that \u201cthe jurisdiction of the military\ncommission should be restricted to cases of offence consist\ning in overt acts, i.e. in unlawful commissions or actual\nattempts to commit, and not in intentions merely.\u201d Win\nthrop 841 (emphasis in original). This passage would be\nhelpful to the plurality if its subject were \u201cconspiracy,\u201d\nrather than the \u201cjurisdiction of the military commission.\u201d\nWinthrop is not speaking here of the requirements for a\nconspiracy charge, but of the requirements for all charges.\nIntentions do not suffice. An unlawful act\u2014such as com\nmitting the crime of conspiracy\u2014is necessary. Winthrop\nsays nothing to exclude either conspiracy or membership\nin a criminal enterprise, both of which go beyond \u201cinten\ntions merely\u201d and \u201cconsis[t] of overt acts, i.e. . . . unlawful\ncommissions or actual attempts to commit,\u201d and both of\nwhich are expressly recognized by Winthrop as crimes\nagainst the law of war triable by military commissions.\nId., at 784; id., at 839, and n. 5, 840. Indeed, the commis\nsion of an \u201covert ac[t]\u201d is the traditional requirement for\nthe completion of the crime of conspiracy, and the charge\nagainst Hamdan alleges numerous such overt acts. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 65a. The plurality\u2019s approach, unsup\nported by Winthrop, requires that any overt act to further\na conspiracy must itself be a completed war crime distinct\nfrom conspiracy\u2014which merely begs the question the\nplurality sets out to answer, namely, whether conspiracy\nitself may constitute a violation of the law of war. And,\neven the plurality\u2019s unsupported standard is satisfied\n28                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nhere. Hamdan has been charged with the overt acts of\nproviding protection, transportation, weapons, and other\nservices to the enemy, id., at 65a\u201367a, acts which in and of\nthemselves are violations of the laws of war. See supra, at\n20\u201321; Winthrop 839\u2013840.\n                               3\n   Ultimately, the plurality\u2019s determination that Hamdan\nhas not been charged with an offense triable before a\nmilitary commission rests not upon any historical example\nor authority, but upon the plurality\u2019s raw judgment of the\n\u201cinability on the Executive\u2019s part here to satisfy the most\nbasic precondition . . . for establishment of military com\nmissions: military necessity.\u201d Ante, at 48. This judgment\nstarkly confirms that the plurality has appointed itself the\nultimate arbiter of what is quintessentially a policy and\nmilitary judgment, namely, the appropriate military\nmeasures to take against those who \u201caided the terrorist\nattacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.\u201d AUMF\n\u00a72(a), 115 Stat. 224. The plurality\u2019s suggestion that Ham\ndan\u2019s commission is illegitimate because it is not dispens\ning swift justice on the battlefield is unsupportable. Ante,\nat 43. Even a cursory review of the authorities confirms\nthat law-of-war military commissions have wide-ranging\njurisdiction to try offenses against the law of war in exi\ngent and nonexigent circumstances alike. See, e.g., Win\nthrop 839\u2013840; see also Yamashita, 327 U. S., at 5 (mili\ntary commission trial after the cessation of hostilities in\nthe Philippines); Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (military commission\ntrial in Washington, D. C.). Traditionally, retributive\njustice for heinous war crimes is as much a \u201cmilitary\nnecessity\u201d as the \u201cdemands\u201d of \u201cmilitary efficiency\u201d touted\nby the plurality, and swift military retribution is precisely\nwhat Congress authorized the President to impose on the\nSeptember 11 attackers in the AUMF.\n   Today a plurality of this Court would hold that conspir\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

The\njudgment of the political branches that Hamdan, and\nothers like him, must be held accountable before military\ncommissions for their involvement with and membership\nin an unlawful organization dedicated to inflicting massive\ncivilian casualties is supported by virtually every relevant\nauthority, including all of the authorities invoked by the\nplurality today. It is also supported by the nature of the\npresent conflict. We are not engaged in a traditional\nbattle with a nation-state, but with a worldwide, hydra-\nheaded enemy, who lurks in the shadows conspiring to\nreproduce the atrocities of September 11, 2001, and who\nhas boasted of sending suicide bombers into civilian gath\nerings, has proudly distributed videotapes of beheadings of\ncivilian workers, and has tortured and dismembered\ncaptured American soldiers. But according to the plural\nity, when our Armed Forces capture those who are plotting\nterrorist atrocities like the bombing of the Khobar Towers,\nthe bombing of the U. S. S. Cole, and the attacks of Sep\ntember 11\u2014even if their plots are advanced to the very\nbrink of fulfillment\u2014our military cannot charge those\ncriminals with any offense against the laws of war. In\nstead, our troops must catch the terrorists \u201credhanded,\u201d\nante, at 48, in the midst of the attack itself, in order to\nbring them to justice. Not only is this conclusion funda\nmentally inconsistent with the cardinal principal of the\nlaw of war, namely protecting non-combatants, but it\nwould sorely hamper the President\u2019s ability to confront\nand defeat a new and deadly enemy.\n   After seeing the plurality overturn longstanding prece\ndents in order to seize jurisdiction over this case, ante, at\n2\u20134 (SCALIA, J., dissenting), and after seeing them disre\ngard the clear prudential counsel that they abstain in\nthese circumstances from using equitable powers, ante, at\n19\u201324, it is no surprise to see them go on to overrule one\n30                HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nafter another of the President\u2019s judgments pertaining to\nthe conduct of an ongoing war. Those Justices who today\ndisregard the commander-in-chief\u2019s wartime decisions,\nonly 10 days ago deferred to the judgment of the Corps of\nEngineers with regard to a matter much more within the\ncompetence of lawyers, upholding that agency\u2019s wildly\nimplausible conclusion that a storm drain is a tributary of\nthe waters of the United States. See Rapanos v. United\nStates, 547 U. S. ___(2006). It goes without saying that\nthere is much more at stake here than storm drains. The\nplurality\u2019s willingness to second-guess the determination\nof the political branches that these conspirators must be\nbrought to justice is both unprecedented and dangerous.\n                             III\n  The Court holds that even if \u201cthe Government has\ncharged Hamdan with an offense against the law of war\ncognizable by military commission, the commission lacks\npower to proceed\u201d because of its failure to comply with the\nterms of the UCMJ and the four Geneva Conventions signed\nin 1949. Ante, at 49. This position is untenable.\n                             A\n   As with the jurisdiction of military commissions, the\nprocedure of such commissions \u201chas [not] been prescribed\nby statute,\u201d but \u201chas been adapted in each instance to the\nneed that called it forth.\u201d Madsen, 343 U. S., at 347\u2013348.\nIndeed, this Court has concluded that \u201c[i]n the absence of\nattempts by Congress to limit the President\u2019s power, it\nappears that, as Commander in Chief of the Army and\nNavy of the United States, he may, in time of war, estab\nlish and prescribe the jurisdiction and procedure of mili\ntary commissions.\u201d Id., at 348. This conclusion is consis\ntent with this Court\u2019s understanding that military\ncommissions are \u201cour common-law war courts.\u201d Id., at\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

This conclusion is not only\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 Though    it does not constitute a basis for any holding of the Court,\nthe Court maintains that, as a \u201cgeneral rule,\u201d \u201cthe procedures govern\ning trials by military commission historically have been the same as\nthose governing courts-martial.\u201d Ante, at 54, 53. While it is undoubt\nedly true that military commissions have invariably employed most of\nthe procedures employed by courts-martial, that is not a requirement.\nSee Winthrop 841 (\u201c[M]ilitary commissions . . . are commonly conducted\naccording to the rules and forms governing courts-martial. These war-\ncourts are indeed more summary in their action than are the courts\nheld under the Articles of war, and . . . their proceedings . . . will not be\nrendered illegal by the omission of details required upon trials by\ncourts-martial\u201d (emphasis in original; footnotes omitted)); 1 U. N.\nCommission 116\u2013117 (\u201cThe [World War II] Mediterranean Regulations\n(No. 8) provide that Military Commissions shall conduct their proceed\nings as may be deemed necessary for full and fair trial, having regard\nfor, but not being bound by, the rules of procedure prescribed for Gen\neral Courts Martial\u201d (emphasis added)); id., at 117 (\u201cIn the [World War\nII] European directive it is stated . . . that Military Commissions shall\nhave power to make, as occasion requires, such rules for the conduct of\ntheir proceedings consistent with the powers of such Commissions, and\nwith the rules of procedure . . . as are deemed necessary for a full and\nfair trial of the accused, having regard for, without being bound by, the\nrules of procedure and evidence prescribed for General Courts Mar\ntial\u201d). Moreover, such a requirement would conflict with the settled\nunderstanding of the flexible and responsive nature of military com\nmissions and the President\u2019s wartime authority to employ such tribu\nnals as he sees fit. See Birkhimer 537\u2013538 (\u201c[M]ilitary commissions may\nso vary their procedure as to adapt it to any situation, and may extend\ntheir powers to any necessary degree. . . . The military commander decides\nupon the character of the military tribunal which is suited to the occasion\n. . . and his decision is final\u201d).\n32                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncontrary to the text and structure of the UCMJ, but it is\nalso inconsistent with precedent of this Court. Consistent\nwith Madsen\u2019s conclusion pertaining to the common-law\nnature of military commissions and the President\u2019s discre\ntion to prescribe their procedures, Article 36 of the UCMJ\nauthorizes the President to establish procedures for mili\ntary commissions \u201cwhich shall, so far as he considers\npracticable, apply the principles of law and the rules of\nevidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases\nin the United States district courts, but which may not be\ncontrary to or inconsistent with this chapter.\u201d 10 U. S. C.\n\u00a7836(a) (emphasis added). Far from constraining the\nPresident\u2019s authority, Article 36 recognizes the President\u2019s\nprerogative to depart from the procedures applicable in\ncriminal cases whenever he alone does not deem such\nprocedures \u201cpracticable.\u201d While the procedural regula\ntions promulgated by the Executive must not be \u201ccontrary\nto\u201d the UCMJ, only a few provisions of the UCMJ mention\n\u201cmilitary commissions,\u201d see ante, at 58, n. 49, and there is\nno suggestion that the procedures to be employed by\nHamdan\u2019s commission implicate any of those provisions.\n   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Court concludes that\nArticle 36(b) of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. \u00a7836(b), which\nprovides that \u201c \u2018[a]ll rules and regulations made under this\narticle shall be uniform insofar as practicable,\u2019 \u201d ante, at\n57, requires the President to employ the same rules and\nprocedures in military commissions as are employed by\ncourts-martial \u201cinsofar as practicable.\u201d Ante, at 59. The\nCourt further concludes that Hamdan\u2019s commission is\nunlawful because the President has not explained why it\nis not practicable to apply the same rules and procedures\nto Hamdan\u2019s commission as would be applied in a trial by\ncourt martial. Ante, at 60.\n   This interpretation of \u00a7836(b) is unconvincing. As an\ninitial matter, the Court fails to account for our cases\ninterpreting the predecessor to Article 21 of the UCMJ\u2014\n                    Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                 33\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nArticle 15 of the Articles of War\u2014which provides crucial\ncontext that bears directly on the proper interpretation of\nArticle 36(b). Article 15 of the Articles of War provided\nthat:\n     \u201cThe provisions of these articles conferring jurisdic\n     tion upon courts-martial shall not be construed as de\n     priving military commissions, provost courts, or other\n     military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction in respect\n     of offenders or offences that by statute or by the law of\n     war may be triable by such military commissions,\n     provost courts, or other military tribunals.\u201d\nIn Yamashita, this Court concluded that Article 15 of the\nArticles of War preserved the President\u2019s unfettered au\nthority to prescribe military commission procedure. The\nCourt explained, \u201c[b]y thus recognizing military commis\nsions in order to preserve their traditional jurisdiction\nover enemy combatants unimpaired by the Articles, Con\ngress gave sanction . . . to any use of the military commis\nsion contemplated by the common law of war.\u201d 327 U. S.,\nat 20 (emphasis added)16; see also Quirin, 317 U. S., at 28;\nMadsen, 343 U. S., at 355. In reaching this conclusion,\nthis Court treated as authoritative the congressional\ntestimony of Judge Advocate General Crowder, who testi\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  16 The Court suggests that Congress\u2019 amendment to Article 2 of the\nUCMJ, providing that the UCMJ applies to \u201cpersons within an area\nleased by or otherwise reserved or acquired for the use of the United\nStates,\u201d 10 U. S. C. \u00a7802(a)(12), deprives Yamashita\u2019s conclusion\nrespecting the President\u2019s authority to promulgate military commission\nprocedures of its \u201cprecedential value.\u201d Ante, at 56. But this merely\nbegs the question of the scope and content of the remaining provisions\nof the UCMJ. Nothing in the additions to Article 2, or any other\nprovision of the UCMJ, suggests that Congress has disturbed this\nCourt\u2019s unequivocal interpretation of Article 21 as preserving the\ncommon-law status of military commissions and the corresponding\nauthority of the President to set their procedures pursuant to his\ncommander-in-chief powers. See Quirin, 317 U. S., at 28; Yamashita,\n327 U. S., at 20; Madsen v. Kinsella, 343 U. S. 341, 355 (1952).\n34                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nfied that Article 15 of the Articles of War was enacted to\npreserve the military commission as \u201c \u2018our common-law\nwar court.\u2019 \u201d Yamashita, supra, at 19, n. 7. And this Court\nrecognized that Article 15\u2019s preservation of military com\nmissions as common-law war courts preserved the Presi\ndent\u2019s commander-in-chief authority to both \u201cestablish\u201d\nmilitary commissions and to \u201cprescribe [their] proce\ndure[s].\u201d Madsen, 343 U. S., at 348; id., at 348\u2013349 (ex\nplaining that Congress had \u201crefrain[ed] from legislating\u201d\nin the area of military commission procedures, in \u201ccon\ntras[t] with its traditional readiness to . . . prescrib[e],\nwith particularity, the jurisdiction and procedure of\nUnited States courts-martial\u201d); cf. Green 834 (\u201cThe mili\ntary commission exercising jurisdiction under common law\nauthority is usually appointed by a superior military\ncommander and is limited in its procedure only by the will\nof that commander. Like any other common law court, in\nthe absence of directive of superior authority to the con\ntrary, the military commission is free to formulate its own\nrules of procedure\u201d).\n   Given these precedents, the Court\u2019s conclusion that\nArticle 36(b) requires the President to apply the same\nrules and procedures to military commissions as are appli\ncable to courts-martial is unsustainable. When Congress\ncodified Article 15 of the Articles of War in Article 21 of\nthe UCMJ it was \u201cpresumed to be aware of . . . and to\nadopt\u201d this Court\u2019s interpretation of that provision as\npreserving the common-law status of military commis\nsions, inclusive of the President\u2019s unfettered authority to\nprescribe their procedures. Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S.\n575, 580 (1978). The Court\u2019s conclusion that Article 36(b)\nrepudiates this settled meaning of Article 21 is not based\nupon a specific textual reference to military commissions,\nbut rather on a one-sentence subsection providing that\n\u201c[a]ll rules and regulations made under this article shall\nbe uniform insofar as practicable.\u201d 10 U. S. C. \u00a7836(b).\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            35\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nThis is little more than an impermissible repeal by impli\ncation. See Branch v. Smith, 538 U.

Moreover, the Court\u2019s conclusion is flatly con\ntrary to its duty not to set aside Hamdan\u2019s commission\n\u201cwithout the clear conviction that [it is] in conflict with the\n. . . laws of Congress constitutionally enacted.\u201d Quirin,\nsupra, at 25 (emphasis added).\n    Nothing in the text of Article 36(b) supports the Court\u2019s\nsweeping conclusion that it represents an unprecedented\ncongressional effort to change the nature of military com\nmissions from common-law war courts to tribunals that\nmust presumptively function like courts-martial. And\nsuch an interpretation would be strange indeed. The\nvision of uniformity that motivated the adoption of the\nUCMJ, embodied specifically in Article 36(b), is nothing\nmore than uniformity across the separate branches of the\narmed services. See ch. 169, 64 Stat. 107 (preamble to the\nUCMJ explaining that the UCMJ is an act \u201c[t]o unify,\nconsolidate, revise, and codify the Articles of War, the\nArticles for the Government of the Navy, and the discipli\nnary laws of the Coast Guard\u201d). There is no indication\nthat the UCMJ was intended to require uniformity in\nprocedure between courts-martial and military commis\nsions, tribunals that the UCMJ itself recognizes are differ\nent. To the contrary, the UCMJ expressly recognizes that\ndifferent tribunals will be constituted in different manners\nand employ different procedures. See 10 U. S. C. \u00a7866\n(providing for three different types of courts-martial\u2014\ngeneral, special, and summary\u2014constituted in different\nmanners and employing different procedures). Thus,\nArticle 36(b) is best understood as establishing that, so far\nas practicable, the rules and regulations governing tribu\nnals convened by the Navy must be uniform with the rules\n36                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nand regulations governing tribunals convened by the\nArmy. But, consistent with this Court\u2019s prior interpreta\ntions of Article 21 and over a century of historical practice,\nit cannot be understood to require the President to con\nform the procedures employed by military commissions to\nthose employed by courts-martial.17\n   Even if Article 36(b) could be construed to require pro\ncedural uniformity among the various tribunals contem\nplated by the UCMJ, Hamdan would not be entitled to\nrelief. Under the Court\u2019s reading, the President is entitled\nto prescribe different rules for military commissions than\nfor courts-martial when he determines that it is not \u201cprac\nticable\u201d to prescribe uniform rules. The Court does not\nresolve the level of deference such determinations would\nbe owed, however, because, in its view, \u201c[t]he President\nhas not . . . [determined] that it is impracticable to apply\nthe rules for courts-martial.\u201d Ante, at 60. This is simply\nnot the case. On the same day that the President issued\nMilitary Commission Order No. 1, the Secretary of De\nfense explained that \u201cthe president decided to establish\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  17 Itbears noting that while the Court does not hesitate to cite legis\nlative history that supports its view of certain statutory provisions, see\nante, at 14\u201315, and n. 10, it makes no citation of the legislative history\npertaining to Article 36(b), which contradicts its interpretation of that\nprovision. Indeed, if it were authoritative, the only legislative history\nrelating to Article 36(b) would confirm the obvious\u2014Article 36(b)\u2019s\nuniformity requirement pertains to uniformity between the three\nbranches of the Armed Forces, and no more. When that subsection was\nintroduced as an amendment to Article 36, its author explained that it\nwould leave the three branches \u201cenough leeway to provide a different\nprovision where it is absolutely necessary\u201d because \u201cthere are some\ndifferences in the services.\u201d Hearings on H.

A further statement explained that\n\u201cthere might be some slight differences that would pertain as to the\nNavy in contrast to the Army, but at least [Article 36(b)] is an expres\nsion of the congressional intent that we want it to be as uniform as\npossible.\u201d Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

The President reached this conclusion because\n    \u201cwe\u2019re in the middle of a war, and . . . had to design a\n    procedure that would allow us to pursue justice for\n    these individuals while at the same time prosecuting\n    the war most effectively. And that means setting\n    rules that would allow us to preserve our intelligence\n    secrets, develop more information about terrorist ac\n    tivities that might be planned for the future so that\n    we can take action to prevent terrorist attacks against\n    the United States. . . .

And, in the context of the present conflict, it\nis exactly the kind of determination Congress countenanced\nwhen it authorized the President to use all necessary and\nappropriate force against our enemies. Accordingly, the\nPresident\u2019s determination is sufficient to satisfy any practi\ncability requirement imposed by Article 36(b).\n   The plurality further contends that Hamdan\u2019s commis\nsion is unlawful because it fails to provide him the right to\nbe present at his trial, as recognized in 10 U.

See Massa\nchusetts v. United States, 333 U. S. 611, 623 (1948). While\nthe Court attempts to cast Eisentrager\u2019s unqualified,\nalternative holding as footnote dictum, ante, at 63\u201364, it\ndoes not dispute the correctness of its conclusion, namely,\nthat the provisions of the 1929 Geneva Convention were\nnot judicially enforceable because that Convention con\ntemplated that diplomatic measures by political and mili\ntary authorities were the exclusive mechanisms for such\nenforcement. Nor does the Court suggest that the 1949\nGeneva Conventions departed from this framework. See\nante, at 64 (\u201cWe may assume that \u2018the obvious scheme\u2019 of\nthe 1949 Conventions is identical in all relevant respects\nto that of the 1929 Convention\u201d).\n  Instead, the Court concludes that petitioner may seek\njudicial enforcement of the provisions of the Geneva Con\nventions because \u201cthey are . . . part of the law of war. And\ncompliance with the law of war is the condition upon\nwhich the authority set forth in Article 21 is granted.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          41\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nAnte, at 65 (citation omitted). But Article 21 authorizes\nthe use of military commissions; it does not purport to\nrender judicially enforceable aspects of the law of war that\nare not so enforceable of their own accord. See Quirin, 317\nU. S., at 28 (by enacting Article 21, \u201cCongress has explic\nitly provided, so far as it may constitutionally do so, that\nmilitary tribunals shall have jurisdiction to try offenders\nor offenses against the law of war\u201d). The Court cannot\nescape Eisentrager\u2019s holding merely by observing that\nArticle 21 mentions the law of war; indeed, though Eisen\ntrager did not specifically consider the Court\u2019s novel inter\npretation of Article 21, Eisentrager involved a challenge to\nthe legality of a World War II military commission, which,\nlike all such commissions, found its authorization in Arti\ncle 15 of the Articles of War, the predecessor to Article 21\nof the UCMJ. Thus, the Court\u2019s interpretation of Article\n21 is foreclosed by Eisentrager.\n   In any event, the Court\u2019s argument is too clever by half.\nThe judicial nonenforceability of the Geneva Conventions\nderives from the fact that those Conventions have exclu\nsive enforcement mechanisms, see Eisentrager, supra, at\n789, n. 14, and this, too, is part of the law of war. The\nCourt\u2019s position thus rests on the assumption that Article\n21\u2019s reference to the \u201claws of war\u201d selectively incorporates\nonly those aspects of the Geneva Conventions that the\nCourt finds convenient, namely, the substantive require\nments of Common Article 3, and not those aspects of the\nConventions that the Court, for whatever reason, disfavors,\nnamely the Conventions\u2019 exclusive diplomatic enforcement\nscheme. The Court provides no account of why the partial\nincorporation of the Geneva Conventions should extend\nonly so far\u2014and no further\u2014because none is available\nbeyond its evident preference to adjudicate those matters\nthat the law of war, through the Geneva Conventions,\nconsigns exclusively to the political branches.\n   Even if the Court were correct that Article 21 of the\n42                 HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nUCMJ renders judicially enforceable aspects of the law of\nwar that are not so enforceable by their own terms, Article\n21 simply cannot be interpreted to render judicially en\nforceable the particular provision of the law of war at issue\nhere, namely Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conven\ntions. As relevant, Article 21 provides that \u201c[t]he provi\nsions of this chapter conferring jurisdiction upon courts-\nmartial do not deprive military commissions . . . of concur\nrent jurisdiction with respect to offenders or offenses that\nby statute or by the law of war may be tried by military\ncommissions.\u201d 10 U. S. C. \u00a7821 (emphasis added). Thus,\nto the extent Article 21 can be interpreted as authorizing\njudicial enforcement of aspects of the law of war that are\nnot otherwise judicially enforceable, that authorization\nonly extends to provisions of the law of war that relate to\nwhether a particular \u201coffender\u201d or a particular \u201coffense\u201d is\ntriable by military commission. Common Article 3 of the\nGeneva Conventions, the sole provision of the Geneva\nConventions relevant to the Court\u2019s holding, relates to\nneither. Rather, it relates exclusively to the particulars of\nthe tribunal itself, namely, whether it is \u201cregularly consti\ntuted\u201d and whether it \u201cafford[s] all the judicial guarantees\nwhich are recognized as indispensable by civilized peo\nples.\u201d Third Geneva Convention, Art. 3, \u00b61(d), Relative to\nthe Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6\nU.

S No. 3364.\n                               2\n   In addition to being foreclosed by Eisentrager, Hamdan\u2019s\nclaim under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions\nis meritless. Common Article 3 applies to \u201carmed conflict\nnot of an international character occurring in the territory\nof one of the High Contracting Parties.\u201d 6 U. S.

Under this Court\u2019s\nprecedents, \u201cthe meaning attributed to treaty provisions\nby the Government agencies charged with their negotia\ntion and enforcement is entitled to great weight.\u201d Sumi\ntomo Shoji America, Inc. v. Avagliano, 457 U. S. 176, 184\u2013\n185 (1982); United States v. Stuart, 489 U. S. 353, 369\n(1989). Our duty to defer to the President\u2019s understanding\nof the provision at issue here is only heightened by the fact\nthat he is acting pursuant to his constitutional authority as\nCommander in Chief and by the fact that the subject matter\nof Common Article 3 calls for a judgment about the nature\nand character of an armed conflict. See generally United\nStates v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 320\n(1936).\n    The President\u2019s interpretation of Common Article 3 is\nreasonable and should be sustained. The conflict with al\nQaeda is international in character in the sense that it is\noccurring in various nations around the globe. Thus, it is\nalso \u201coccurring in the territory of\u201d more than \u201cone of the\nHigh Contracting Parties.\u201d The Court does not dispute the\nPresident\u2019s judgments respecting the nature of our conflict\nwith al Qaeda, nor does it suggest that the President\u2019s\ninterpretation of Common Article 3 is implausible or\nforeclosed by the text of the treaty. Indeed, the Court\nconcedes that Common Article 3 is principally concerned\nwith \u201cfurnish[ing] minimal protection to rebels involved in\n. . . a civil war,\u201d ante, at 68, precisely the type of conflict\nthe President\u2019s interpretation envisions to be subject to\nCommon Article 3. Instead, the Court, without acknowl\nedging its duty to defer to the President, adopts its own,\nadmittedly plausible, reading of Common Article 3. But\nwhere, as here, an ambiguous treaty provision (\u201cnot of an\n44                     HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ninternational character\u201d) is susceptible of two plausible,\nand reasonable, interpretations, our precedents require us\nto defer to the Executive\u2019s interpretation.\n                                3\n   But even if Common Article 3 were judicially enforce\nable and applicable to the present conflict, petitioner\nwould not be entitled to relief. As an initial matter, any\nclaim petitioner has under Common Article 3 is not ripe.\nThe only relevant \u201cacts\u201d that \u201care and shall remain prohib\nited\u201d under Common Article 3 are \u201cthe passing of sen\ntences and the carrying out of executions without previous\njudgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court\naffording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized\nas indispensable by civilized peoples.\u201d Art. 3, \u00b61(d), 6\nU. S. T., at 1318, 1320 (emphases added). As its terms\nmake clear, Common Article 3 is only violated, as relevant\nhere, by the act of \u201cpassing of sentenc[e],\u201d and thus Ham\ndan will only have a claim if his military commission\nconvicts him and imposes a sentence. Accordingly, as\nHamdan\u2019s claim is \u201ccontingent [upon] future events that\nmay not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at\nall,\u201d it is not ripe for adjudication. Texas v. United States,\n523 U. S. 296, 300 (1998) (internal quotation marks omit\nted).19 Indeed, even if we assume he will be convicted and\nsentenced, whether his trial will be conducted in a manner\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  19 The Court does not dispute the conclusion that Common Article 3\ncannot be violated unless and until Hamdan is convicted and sen\ntenced. Instead, it contends that \u201cthe Geneva Conventions d[o] not\ndirect an accused to wait until sentence is imposed to challenge the\nlegality of the tribunal that is to try him.\u201d Ante, at 62, n. 55. But the\nGeneva Contentions do not direct defendants to enforce their rights\nthrough litigation, but through the Conventions\u2019 exclusive diplomatic\nenforcement provisions. Moreover, neither the Court\u2019s observation\nrespecting the Geneva Conventions nor its reference to the equitable\ndoctrine of abstention bears on the constitutional prohibition on adjudi\ncating unripe claims.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          45\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nso as to deprive him of \u201cthe judicial guarantees which are\nrecognized as indispensable by civilized peoples\u201d is en\ntirely speculative. And premature adjudication of Ham\ndan\u2019s claim is especially inappropriate here because\n\u201creaching the merits of the dispute would force us to de\ncide whether an action taken by one of the other two\nbranches of the Federal Government was unconstitu\ntional.\u201d Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S. 811, 819\u2013820 (1997).\n   In any event, Hamdan\u2019s military commission complies\nwith the requirements of Common Article 3. It is plainly\n\u201cregularly constituted\u201d because such commissions have\nbeen employed throughout our history to try unlawful\ncombatants for crimes against the law of war. This Court\nhas recounted that history as follows:\n    \u201c \u2018By a practice dating from 1847 and renewed and\n    firmly established during the Civil War, military\n    commissions have become adopted as authorized tri\n    bunals in this country in time of war. . . . Their com\n    petency has been recognized not only in acts of Con\n    gress, but in executive proclamations, in rulings of the\n    courts, and in the opinions of the Attorneys General.\u2019 \u201d\n    Madsen, 343 U. S., at 346, n. 8.\nHamdan\u2019s commission has been constituted in accordance\nwith these historical precedents. As I have previously\nexplained, the procedures to be employed by that commis\nsion, and the Executive\u2019s authority to alter those proce\ndures, are consistent with the practice of previous Ameri\ncan military commissions. See supra, at 30\u201334 , and n. 15.\n   The Court concludes Hamdan\u2019s commission fails to\nsatisfy the requirements of Common Article 3 not because\nit differs from the practice of previous military commis\nsions but because it \u201cdeviate[s] from [the procedures]\ngoverning courts-martial.\u201d Ante, at 71. But there is nei\nther a statutory nor historical requirement that military\ncommissions conform to the structure and practice of\n46                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncourts-martial. A military commission is a different tri\nbunal, serving a different function, and thus operates\npursuant to different procedures. The 150-year pedigree\nof the military commission is itself sufficient to establish\nthat such tribunals are \u201cregularly constituted court[s].\u201d\nArt. 3, \u00b61(d), 6 U. S. T., at 3320.\n  Similarly, the procedures to be employed by Hamdan\u2019s\ncommission afford \u201call the judicial guarantees which are\nrecognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.\u201d Neither\nthe Court nor petitioner disputes the Government\u2019s de\nscription of those procedures.\n     \u201cPetitioner is entitled to appointed military legal coun\n     sel, 32 C.F.R. 9.4(c)(2), and may retain a civilian attor\n     ney (which he has done), 32 C.F.R. 9.4(c)(2)(iii)(B).

Ante, at 70\u201372. But,\nunder the commissions\u2019 rules, the Government may not\nimpose such bar or denial on Hamdan if it would render\nhis trial unfair, a question that is clearly within the scope\nof the appellate review contemplated by regulation and\nstatute.\n    Moreover, while the Executive is surely not required to\noffer a particularized defense of these procedures prior to\ntheir application, the procedures themselves make clear\nthat Hamdan would only be excluded (other than for\ndisruption) if it were necessary to protect classified (or\nclassifiable) intelligence, Dept. of Defense, Military Com\nmission Order No. 1, \u00a76(B)(3) (Aug. 31, 2005), including\nthe sources and methods for gathering such intelligence.\nThe Government has explained that \u201cwe want to make\nsure that these proceedings, which are going on in the\nmiddle of the war, do not interfere with our war effort and\n. . . because of the way we would be able to handle interro\ngations and intelligence information, may actually assist\nus in promoting our war aims.\u201d News Briefing (remarks of\nDouglas J.

S., at 320. This interest is surely compelling\nhere. According to the Government, \u201c[b]ecause al Qaeda\noperates as a clandestine force relying on sleeper agents to\nmount surprise attacks, one of the most critical fronts in the\ncurrent war involves gathering intelligence about future\nterrorist attacks and how the terrorist network operates\u2014\nidentifying where its operatives are, how it plans attacks,\nwho directs operations, and how they communicate.\u201d Brief\nfor United States in No. 03\u20134792, United States v.

I disagree with this holding because\npetitioner\u2019s commission is \u201ca regularly constituted court.\u201d\n   Common Article 3 provides as follows:\n    \u201cIn the case of armed conflict not of an international\n    character occurring in the territory of one of the High\n    Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict shall\n    be bound to apply, as a minimum, the following\n    provisions:\n      \u201c(1) . . .

The first require\nment is largely self-explanatory, and, with respect to the\nthird, I note only that on its face it imposes a uniform\ninternational standard that does not vary from signatory\nto signatory.\n  The second element (\u201cregularly constituted\u201d) is the one\non which the Court relies, and I interpret this element to\nrequire that the court be appointed or established in ac\ncordance with the appointing country\u2019s domestic law. I\nagree with the Court, see ante, at 69, n. 64, that, as used\nin Common Article 3, the term \u201cregularly\u201d is synonymous\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            3\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwith \u201cproperly.\u201d The term \u201cconstitute\u201d means \u201cappoint,\u201d\n\u201cset up,\u201d or \u201cestablish,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International\nDictionary 486 (1961), and therefore \u201cregularly consti\ntuted\u201d means properly appointed, set up, or established.\nOur cases repeatedly use the phrases \u201cregularly consti\ntuted\u201d and \u201cproperly constituted\u201d in this sense. See, e.g.,\nHamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 538 (2004) (plurality\nopinion of O\u2019Connor, J.); Nguyen v. United States, 539 U. S.\n69, 83 (2003); Ryder v. United States, 515 U. S. 177, 187\n(1995); Williams v. Bruffy, 96 U. S. 176, 185 (1878).\n   In order to determine whether a court has been properly\nappointed, set up, or established, it is necessary to refer to\na body of law that governs such matters. I interpret\nCommon Article 3 as looking to the domestic law of the\nappointing country because I am not aware of any interna\ntional law standard regarding the way in which such a\ncourt must be appointed, set up, or established, and be\ncause different countries with different government struc\ntures handle this matter differently. Accordingly, \u201ca\nregularly constituted court\u201d is a court that has been ap\npointed, set up, or established in accordance with the\ndomestic law of the appointing country.\n                             II\n  In contrast to this interpretation, the opinions support\ning the judgment today hold that the military commission\nbefore which petitioner would be tried is not \u201ca regularly\nconstituted court\u201d (a) because \u201cno evident practical need\nexplains\u201d why its \u201cstructure and composition . . . deviate\nfrom conventional court-martial standards,\u201d ante, at 11\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring in part); see also ante, at 69\u201370\n(Opinion of the Court); and (b) because, contrary to 10\nU. S. C. \u00a7836(b), the procedures specified for use in the\nproceeding before the military commission impermissibly\ndiffer from those provided under the Uniform Code of\nMilitary Justice (UCMJ) for use by courts-martial, ante, at\n4                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n52\u201362 (Opinion of the Court); ante, at 16\u201318 (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring in part). I do not believe that either of these\ngrounds is sound.\n                               A\n   I see no basis for the Court\u2019s holding that a military\ncommission cannot be regarded as \u201ca regularly constituted\ncourt\u201d unless it is similar in structure and composition to a\nregular military court or unless there is an \u201cevident prac\ntical need\u201d for the divergence. There is no reason why a\ncourt that differs in structure or composition from an\nordinary military court must be viewed as having been\nimproperly constituted. Tribunals that vary significantly\nin structure, composition, and procedures may all be\n\u201cregularly\u201d or \u201cproperly\u201d constituted. Consider, for exam\nple, a municipal court, a state trial court of general juris\ndiction, an Article I federal trial court, a federal district\ncourt, and an international court, such as the Interna\ntional Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.\nAlthough these courts are \u201cdifferently constituted\u201d and\ndiffer substantially in many other respects, they are all\n\u201cregularly constituted.\u201d\n   If Common Article 3 had been meant to require trial\nbefore a country\u2019s military courts or courts that are simi\nlar in structure and composition, the drafters almost\ncertainly would have used language that expresses that\nthought more directly. Other provisions of the Convention\nRelative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War refer ex\npressly to the ordinary military courts and expressly\nprescribe the \u201cuniformity principle\u201d that JUSTICE\nKENNEDY sees in Common Article 3, see ante, at 8\u20139.\nArticle 84 provides that \u201c[a] prisoner of war shall be tried\nonly by a military court, unless the existing laws of the\nDetaining Power expressly permit the civil courts to try a\nmember of the armed forces of the Detaining Power in\nrespect of the particular offence alleged to have been\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            5\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ncommitted by the prisoner of war.\u201d 6 U. S. T., at 3382.\nArticle 87 states that \u201c[p]risoners of war may not be sen\ntenced by the military authorities and courts of the De\ntaining Power to any penalties except those provided for in\nrespect of members of the armed forces of the said Power\nwho have committed the same acts.\u201d Id., at 3384. Simi\nlarly, Article 66 of the Geneva Convention Relative to the\nTreatment of Civilian Persons in Time of War\u2014a provi\nsion to which the Court looks for guidance in interpreting\nCommon Article 3, see ante at 69\u2014expressly provides that\ncivilians charged with committing crimes in occupied\nterritory may be handed over by the occupying power \u201cto\nits properly constituted, non-political military courts, on\ncondition that the said courts sit in the occupied country.\u201d\n6 U. S. T. 3516, 3558\u20133560, T. I. A. S. No. 3365. If Com\nmon Article 3 had been meant to incorporate a \u201cuniformity\nprinciple,\u201d it presumably would have used language like\nthat employed in the provisions noted above. For these\nreasons, I cannot agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that\nthe military commission at issue here is not a \u201cregularly\nconstituted court\u201d because its structure and composition\ndiffer from those of a court-martial.\n   Contrary to the suggestion of the Court, see ante, at 69,\nthe commentary on Article 66 of Fourth Geneva Conven\ntion does not undermine this conclusion. As noted, Article\n66 permits an occupying power to try civilians in its \u201cprop\nerly constituted, non-political military courts,\u201d 6 U. S. T.,\nat 3558. The commentary on this provision states:\n    \u201cThe courts are to be \u2018regularly constituted\u2019. This\n    wording definitely excludes all special tribunals. It is\n    the ordinary military courts of the Occupying Power\n    which will be competent.\u201d 4 Int\u2019l Comm. of Red Cross,\n    Commentary: Geneva Convention Relative to the Pro\n    tection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 340 (1958)\n    (hereinafter GCIV Commentary).\n6                  HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court states that this commentary \u201cdefines \u2018 \u201cregu\nlarly constituted\u201d \u2019 tribunals to include \u2018ordinary military\ncourts\u2019 and \u2018definitely exclud[e] all special tribunals.\u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 69 (alteration in original). This much is clear\nfrom the commentary itself. Yet the mere statement that\na military court is a regularly constituted tribunal is of no\nhelp in addressing petitioner\u2019s claim that his commission\nis not such a tribunal. As for the commentary\u2019s mention of\n\u201cspecial tribunals,\u201d it is doubtful whether we should take\nthis gloss on Article 66\u2014which forbids an occupying power\nfrom trying civilians in courts set up specially for that\npurpose\u2014to tell us much about the very different context\naddressed by Common Article 3.\n   But even if Common Article 3 recognizes this prohibi\ntion on \u201cspecial tribunals,\u201d that prohibition does not cover\npetitioner\u2019s tribunal. If \u201cspecial\u201d means anything in con\ntradistinction to \u201cregular,\u201d it would be in the sense of\n\u201cspecial\u201d as \u201crelating to a single thing,\u201d and \u201cregular\u201d as\n\u201cuniform in course, practice, or occurrence.\u201d Webster\u2019s\nThird New International Dictionary 2186, 1913. Insofar\nas respondents propose to conduct the tribunals according\nto the procedures of Military Commission Order No. 1 and\norders promulgated thereunder\u2014and nobody has sug\ngested respondents intend otherwise\u2014then it seems that\npetitioner\u2019s tribunal, like the hundreds of others respon\ndents propose to conduct, is very much regular and not at\nall special.\n                            B\n   I also disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that peti\ntioner\u2019s military commission is \u201cillegal,\u201d ante, at 62, be\ncause its procedures allegedly do not comply with 10\nU. S. C. \u00a7836. Even if \u00a7836(b), unlike Common Article 3,\ndoes impose at least a limited uniformity requirement\namongst the tribunals contemplated by the UCMJ, but see\nante, at 35 (THOMAS, J., dissenting), and even if it is as\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsumed for the sake of argument that some of the proce\ndures specified in Military Commission Order No. 1\nimpermissibly deviate from court-martial procedures, it\ndoes not follow that the military commissions created by\nthat order are not \u201cregularly constituted\u201d or that trying\npetitioner before such a commission would be inconsistent\nwith the law of war. If Congress enacted a statute requir\ning the federal district courts to follow a procedure that is\nunconstitutional, the statute would be invalid, but the\ndistrict courts would not. Likewise, if some of the proce\ndures that may be used in military commission proceed\nings are improper, the appropriate remedy is to proscribe\nthe use of those particular procedures, not to outlaw the\ncommissions. I see no justification for striking down the\nentire commission structure simply because it is possible\nthat petitioner\u2019s trial might involve the use of some proce\ndure that is improper.\n                               III\n  Returning to the three elements of Common Article 3\u2014\n(1) a court, (2) that is appointed, set up, and established in\ncompliance with domestic law, and (3) that respects uni\nversally recognized fundamental rights\u2014I conclude that\nall of these elements are satisfied in this case.\n                            A\n  First, the commissions qualify as courts.\n  Second, the commissions were appointed, set up, and\nestablished pursuant to an order of the President, just like\nthe commission in Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942), and\nthe Court acknowledges that Quirin recognized that the\nstatutory predecessor of 10 U. S. C. \u00a7821 \u201cpreserved\u201d the\nPresident\u2019s power \u201cto convene military commissions,\u201d ante,\nat 29. Although JUSTICE KENNEDY concludes that \u201can\nacceptable degree of independence from the Executive is\nnecessary to render a commission \u2018regularly constituted\u2019\n8                      HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nby the standards of our Nation\u2019s system of justice,\u201d ante at\n9\u201310, he offers no support for this proposition (which in\nany event seems to be more about fairness or integrity\nthan regularity). The commission in Quirin was certainly\nno more independent from the Executive than the com\nmissions at issue here, and 10 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7821 and 836 do\nnot speak to this issue.1\n   Finally, the commission procedures, taken as a whole,\nand including the availability of review by a United States\nCourt of Appeals and by this Court, do not provide a basis\nfor deeming the commissions to be illegitimate. The Court\nquestions the following two procedural rules: the rule\nallowing the Secretary of Defense to change the governing\nrules \u201c \u2018from time to time\u2019 \u201d (which does not rule out mid-\ntrial changes), see ante, at 70, n. 65 (Opinion of the Court);\nante, at 9\u201310 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part), and the\nrule that permits the admission of any evidence that\nwould have \u201c \u2018probative value to a reasonable person\u2019 \u201d\n(which departs from our legal system\u2019s usual rules of\nevidence), see ante, at 51, 60 (Opinion of the Court); ante,\nat 16\u201318 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part).2 Neither\nof these two rules undermines the legitimacy of the\ncommissions.\n   Surely the entire commission structure cannot be\nstricken merely because it is possible that the governing\nrules might be changed during the course of one or more\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Section821 looks to the \u201claw of war,\u201d not separation of powers is\nsues. And \u00a7836, as JUSTICE KENNEDY notes, concerns procedures, not\nstructure, see ante, at 10.\n  2 The plurality, but not JUSTICE KENNEDY, suggests that the commis\n\nsion rules are improper insofar as they allow a defendant to be denied\naccess to evidence under some circumstances. See, ante, at 70\u201372. But\nhere too, if this procedure is used in a particular case and the accused is\nconvicted, the validity of this procedure can be challenged in the review\nproceeding in that case. In that context, both the asserted need for the\nprocedure and its impact on the accused can be analyzed in concrete\nterms.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           9\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nproceedings. If a change is made and applied during the\ncourse of an ongoing proceeding and if the accused is\nfound guilty, the validity of that procedure can be consid\nered in the review proceeding for that case. After all, not\nevery midtrial change will be prejudicial. A midtrial\nchange might amend the governing rules in a way that is\ninconsequential or actually favorable to the accused.\n  As for the standard for the admission of evidence at\ncommission proceedings, the Court does not suggest that\nthis rule violates the international standard incorporated\ninto Common Article 3 (\u201cthe judicial guarantees which are\nrecognized as indispensable by civilized peoples,\u201d 6\nU. S. T., at 3320). Rules of evidence differ from country to\ncountry, and much of the world does not follow aspects of\nour evidence rules, such as the general prohibition against\nthe admission of hearsay. See, e.g., Blumenthal, Shedding\nSome Light on Calls for Hearsay Reform: Civil Law Hear\nsay Rules in Historical and Modern Perspective, 13 Pace\nInt\u2019l L. Rev. 93, 96\u2013101 (2001). If a particular accused\nclaims to have been unfairly prejudiced by the admission\nof particular evidence, that claim can be reviewed in the\nreview proceeding for that case. It makes no sense to\nstrike down the entire commission structure based on\nspeculation that some evidence might be improperly ad\nmitted in some future case.\n  In sum, I believe that Common Article 3 is satisfied here\nbecause the military commissions (1) qualify as courts, (2)\nthat were appointed and established in accordance with\ndomestic law, and (3) any procedural improprieties that\nmight occur in particular cases can be reviewed in those\ncases.\n                               B\n  The commentary on Common Article 3 supports this\ninterpretation. The commentary on Common Article 3,\n\u00b61(d), in its entirety states:\n10                    HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n       \u201c[A]lthough [sentences and executions without a\n       proper trial] were common practice until quite re\n       cently, they are nevertheless shocking to the civilized\n       mind. . . . Sentences and executions without previous\n       trial are too open to error. \u2018Summary justice\u2019 may be\n       effective on account of the fear it arouses . . . , but it\n       adds too many further innocent victims to all the\n       other innocent victims of the conflict. All civilized na\n       tions surround the administration of justice with safe\n       guards aimed at eliminating the possibility of judicial\n       errors. The Convention has rightly proclaimed that it\n       is essential to do this even in time of war. We must be\n       very clear about one point: it is only \u2018summary\u2019 justice\n       which it is intended to prohibit. No sort of immunity\n       is given to anyone under this provision. There is\n       nothing in it to prevent a person presumed to be\n       guilty from being arrested and so placed in a position\n       where he can do no further harm; and it leaves intact\n       the right of the State to prosecute, sentence and pun\n       ish according to the law.\u201d GCIV Commentary 39 (em\n       phasis added).\n  It seems clear that the commissions at issue here meet\nthis standard. Whatever else may be said about the sys\ntem that was created by Military Commission Order No. 1\nand augmented by the Detainee Treatment Act,\n\u00a71005(e)(1), 119 Stat. 2742, this system\u2014which features\nformal trial procedures, multiple levels of administrative\nreview, and the opportunity for review by a United States\nCourt of Appeals and by this Court\u2014does not dispense\n\u201csummary justice.\u201d\n                           *    *     * \n\n     For these reasons, I respectfully dissent. \n\n</pre>",
