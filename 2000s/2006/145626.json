BANKS, INDIVIDUALLY AND ON\n\n           BEHALF OF ALL OTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED\n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 04\u20131739. Argued March 27, 2006\u2014Decided June 28, 2006\nPennsylvania houses its 40 most dangerous and recalcitrant inmates in\n  a Long Term Segregation Unit (LTSU). Inmates begin in level 2,\n  which has the most severe restrictions, but may graduate to the less\n  restrictive level 1. Plaintiff-respondent Banks, a level 2 inmate, filed\n  this federal-court action against defendant-petitioner, the Secretary\n  of the Department of Corrections, alleging that a level 2 policy (Pol\n  icy) forbidding inmates any access to newspapers, magazines, and\n  photographs violates the First Amendment. During discovery, Banks\n  deposed Deputy Prison Superintendent Dickson and the parties in\n  troduced prison policy manuals and related documents into the re\n  cord. The Secretary then filed a summary judgment motion, along\n  with a statement of undisputed facts and the deposition. Rather\n  than filing an opposition to the motion, Banks filed a cross-motion for\n  summary judgment, relying on the undisputed facts, including those\n  in the deposition. Based on this record, the District Court granted\n  the Secretary\u2019s motion and denied Banks\u2019. Reversing the Secretary\u2019s\n  summary judgment award, the Third Circuit held that the prison\n  regulation could not be supported as a matter of law.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n399 F. 3d 134, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE BREYER, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE KENNEDY,\n  and JUSTICE SOUTER, concluded that, based on the record before this\n  Court, prison officials have set forth adequate legal support for the\n  Policy, and Banks has failed to show specific facts that could warrant\n  a determination in his favor. Pp. 5\u201313.\n2                            BEARD v. BANKS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n       (a) Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, and Overton v. Bazzetta, 539\n    U. S. 126, contain the basic substantive legal standards covering this\n    case. While imprisonment does not automatically deprive a prisoner\n    of constitutional protections, Turner, 482 U. S., at 93, the Constitu\n    tion sometimes permits greater restriction of such rights in a prison\n    than it would allow elsewhere, id., at 84\u201385. As Overton, supra, at\n    132, pointed out, courts also owe \u201csubstantial deference to the profes\n    sional judgment of prison administrators.\u201d Under Turner, restrictive\n    prison regulations are permissible if they are \u201creasonably related to\n    legitimate penological interests.\u201d 482 U. S., at 89. Because this case\n    is here on the Secretary\u2019s summary judgment motion, the Court ex\n    amines the record to determine whether he has demonstrated \u201cthe\n    absence of a genuine issue of material fact\u201d and his entitlement to\n    judgment as a matter of law. See, e.g., Fed . Rule Civ. Proc. 56. If he\n    has, the Court determines whether Banks has \u201cby affidavits or as\n    otherwise provided\u201d in Rule 56, \u201cset forth specific facts showing . . . a\n    genuine issue for trial,\u201d Rule 56(e). Inferences about disputed facts\n    must be drawn in Banks\u2019 favor, but deference must be accorded\n    prison authorities\u2019 views with respect to matters of professional judg\n    ment. Pp. 5\u20136.\n       (b) The Secretary rested his motion primarily on the undisputed\n    facts statement and Dickson\u2019s affidavit. The first of his justifications\n    for the Policy\u2014the need to motivate better behavior on the part of\n    particularly difficult prisoners\u2014sufficiently satisfies Turner\u2019s re\n    quirements. The statement and affidavit set forth a \u201c \u2018valid, rational\n    connection \u2019 \u201d between the Policy and \u201c \u2018legitimate penological inter\n    ests,\u2019 \u201d 482 U. S., at 89, 95. Dickson noted that prison authorities are\n    limited in what they can and cannot deny or give a level 2 inmate,\n    who has already been deprived of most privileges, and that the offi\n    cials believe that the specified items are legitimate as incentives for\n    inmate growth. The undisputed facts statement added that the Pol\n    icy encourages progress and discourages backsliding by level 1 in\n    mates. These statements point to evidence that the regulations serve\n    the function identified. The articulated connections between news\n    papers and magazines, the deprivation of virtually the last privilege\n    left to an inmate, and a significant incentive to improve behavior, are\n    logical ones. Thus, this factor supports the Policy\u2019s \u201creasonableness.\u201d\n    The second, third, and fourth Turner factors\u2014whether there are \u201cal\n    ternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison\n    inmates,\u201d id., at 90; the \u201cimpact\u201d that accommodating \u201cthe asserted\n    constitutional right [will] have on guards and other inmates, and on\n    the allocation of prison resources,\u201d ibid.; and whether there are\n    \u201cready alternatives\u201d for furthering the governmental interest, ibid.\u2014\n    add little to the first factor\u2019s logical rationale here. That two of these\n                   Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nthree factors seem to favor the Policy therefore does not help the Sec\nretary. The real task in this case is not balancing the Turner factors\nbut determining whether the Secretary\u2019s summary judgment mate\nrial shows not just a logical relation but a reasonable relation. Given\nthe deference courts must show to prison officials\u2019 professional judg\nment, the material presented here is sufficient. Overton provides\nsignificant support for this conclusion. In both cases, the depriva\ntions (family visits in Overton and access to newspapers, magazines,\nand photographs here) have an important constitutional dimension;\nprison officials have imposed the deprivation only upon those with\nserious prison-behavior problems; and those officials, relying on their\nprofessional judgment, reached an experience-based conclusion that\nthe policies help to further legitimate prison objectives. Unless there\nis more, the Secretary\u2019s supporting material brings the Policy within\nTurner\u2019s scope. Pp. 6\u201310.\n   (c) Although summary judgment rules gave Banks an opportunity\nto respond to these materials, he did not do so in the manner the\nrules provide. Instead, he filed a cross-motion for summary judg\nment, arguing that the Policy fell of its own weight. Neither the\ncases he cites nor the statistics he notes support his argument. In\nreaching a contrary conclusion, the Third Circuit placed too high an\nevidentiary burden on the Secretary and offered too little deference to\nthe prison officials\u2019 judgment. Such deference does not make it im\npossible for those attacking prison policies to succeed. A prisoner\nmay be able to marshal substantial evidence, for example through\ndepositions, that a policy is not reasonable or that there is a genuine\nissue of material fact for trial. And, as Overton noted, if faced with a\nde facto permanent ban involving a severe restriction, this Court\nmight reach a different conclusion. Pp. 10\u201313.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, concluded that, using\nthe framework set forth in JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019 concurrence in Overton v.\nBazzetta, 539 U. S. 126, 138, Pennsylvania\u2019s prison regulations are\npermissible. That framework provides the least perilous approach for\nresolving challenges to prison regulations and is the approach most\nfaithful to the Constitution. \u201cSentencing a criminal to a term of im\nprisonment may . . . carry with it the implied delegation to prison of\nficials to discipline and otherwise supervise the criminal while he is\nincarcerated.\u201d Id., at 140, n. A term of imprisonment in Pennsyl\nvania includes such an implied delegation. Inmates are subject to\nDepartment of Corrections rules and disciplinary rulings, and the\nchallenged regulations fall with the Department\u2019s discretion. This\nconclusion is supported by the plurality\u2019s Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S.\n78, analysis. The \u201chistory of incarceration as punishment [also] sup\nports the view that the sentenc[e] . . . terminated\u201d respondent\u2019s unfet\n4                            BEARD v.

While Pennsylvania \u201cis free to alter its definition of\n    incarceration to include the retention\u201d of unfettered access to such\n    materials, it appears that the Commonwealth instead sentenced re\n    spondent against the backdrop of its traditional conception of impris\n    onment, which affords no such privileges.

The\ncase arises on a motion for summary judgment. While we\ndo not deny the constitutional importance of the interests\nin question, we find, on the basis of the record now before\nus, that prison officials have set forth adequate legal\nsupport for the policy.

S. 126, 132 (2003) (need for \u201csubstantial deference to\nthe professional judgment of prison administrators\u201d).\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   The prison regulation at issue applies to certain prison\ners housed in Pennsylvania\u2019s Long Term Segregation Unit.\nThe LTSU is the most restrictive of the three special units\nthat Pennsylvania maintains for difficult prisoners. The\nfirst such unit, the \u201cRestricted Housing Unit,\u201d is designed\nfor prisoners who are under disciplinary sanction or who\nare assigned to administrative segregation. App. 80. The\nsecond such unit, the \u201cSpecial Management Unit,\u201d is\nintended for prisoners who \u201cexhibit behavior that is con\ntinually disruptive, violent, dangerous or a threat to the\norderly operation of their assigned facility.\u201d Ibid. The\nthird such unit, the LTSU, is reserved for the Common\nwealth\u2019s \u201cmost incorrigible, recalcitrant inmates.\u201d Id., at\n25.\n   LTSU inmates number about 40. Id., at 127. Most, but\nnot all, have \u201cflunked out\u201d of the SMU program. Id., at\n137. To qualify, they must have met one or more of the\nfollowing conditions: failure to \u201ccomplete\u201d the SMU pro\ngram; \u201cassaultive behavior with the intent to cause death\nor serious bodily injury\u201d; causing injury to other inmates\nor staff; \u201cengaging in facility disturbance(s)\u201d; belonging to\nan unauthorized organization or \u201cSecurity Threat Group\u201d;\nengaging in criminal activity that \u201cthreatens the commu\nnity\u201d; possessing while in prison \u201cweapons\u201d or \u201cimple\nments of escape\u201d; or having a history of \u201cserious\u201d escape\nattempts, \u201cexerting negative influence in facility activi\nties,\u201d or being a \u201csexual predator.\u201d Id., at 85\u201386. The\nLTSU is divided into two levels. All inmates are initially\nassigned to the most restrictive level, level 2. After 90\ndays, depending upon an inmate\u2019s behavior, an individual\nmay graduate to the less restrictive level 1, although in\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

Id., at 131\u2013132, 138.\n  The RHU, SMU, and LTSU all seriously restrict in\nmates\u2019 ordinary prison privileges. At all three units,\nresidents are typically confined to cells for 23 hours a day,\nhave limited access to the commissary or outside visitors,\nand (with the exception of some phases of the SMU) may\nnot watch television or listen to the radio. Id., at 102;\nBrief for Petitioner 2\u20134.\n  Prisoners at level 2 of the LTSU face the most severe\nform of the restrictions listed above. They have no access\nto the commissary, they may have only one visitor per\nmonth (an immediate family member), and they are not\nallowed phone calls except in emergencies. App. 102. In\naddition they (unlike all other prisoners in the Common\nwealth) are restricted in the manner at issue here: They\nhave no access to newspapers, magazines, or personal\nphotographs. Id., at 26. They are nonetheless permitted\nlegal and personal correspondence, religious and legal\nmaterials, two library books, and writing paper. Id., at 35,\n102, 169. If an inmate progresses to level 1, he enjoys\nsomewhat less severe restrictions, including the right to\nreceive one newspaper and five magazines. Id., at 26, 102.\nThe ban on photographs is not lifted unless a prisoner\nprogresses out of the LTSU altogether. Ibid.\n                             B\n  In 2001, plaintiff Ronald Banks, respondent here, then a\nprisoner confined to LTSU level 2, filed this federal-court\naction against Jeffrey Beard, the Secretary of the Penn\nsylvania Department of Corrections. See Rev. Stat. \u00a71979,\n42 U. S. C. \u00a71983. Banks claimed that the level 2 Policy\nforbidding inmates all access to newspapers, magazines,\nand photographs bears no reasonable relation to any\nlegitimate penological objective and consequently violates\nthe First Amendment. App. 15; see also Turner, supra;\nOverton, supra. The Secretary, the defendant, petitioner\n4                    BEARD v. BANKS\n\n                    Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nhere, filed an answer. The District Court certified a class\ncomposed of similar level 2 inmates, and the court as\nsigned the case to a Magistrate who conducted discovery.\n   Banks\u2019 counsel deposed a deputy superintendent at the\nprison, Joel Dickson. The parties introduced various\nprison policy manuals and related documents into the\nrecord. And at that point the Secretary filed a motion for\nsummary judgment. He also filed a \u201cStatement of Mate\nrial Facts Not in Dispute,\u201d with a copy of the deputy su\nperintendent\u2019s deposition attached as an appendix. See\nApp. 25; Rule 56.1(C)(1) (WD Pa. 2006).\n   Banks (who was represented by counsel throughout)\nfiled no opposition to the Secretary\u2019s motion, but instead\nfiled a cross-motion for summary judgment. Neither that\ncross-motion nor any other of Banks\u2019 filings sought to\nplace any significant fact in dispute, and Banks has never\nsought a trial to determine the validity of the Policy.\nRather, Banks claimed in his cross-motion that the undis\nputed facts, including those in Dickson\u2019s deposition, enti\ntled him to summary judgment. In this way, and by fail\ning specifically to challenge the facts identified in the\ndefendant\u2019s statement of undisputed facts, Banks is\ndeemed to have admitted the validity of the facts con\ntained in the Secretary\u2019s statement. See Rule 56.1(E).\n   On the basis of the record as described (the complaint,\nthe answer, the statement of undisputed facts, other\nagreed-upon descriptions of the system, the Dickson depo\nsition, and the motions for summary judgment), the Mag\nistrate recommended that the District Court grant the\nSecretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment and deny that\nof Banks. App. to Brief in Opposition 130. The District\nCourt accepted the Magistrate\u2019s recommendation. Id., at\n131\u2013132.\n   On appeal, a divided Third Circuit panel reversed the\nDistrict Court\u2019s award of summary judgment to the Secre\ntary. 399 F. 3d 134 (2005).

The Secretary sought our review of the\nAppeals Court\u2019s judgment, and we granted his petition.\n546 U. S. ___ (2005).\n                               II\n     Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78 (1987), and Overton v.\nBazzetta, 539 U. S 126 (2003), contain the basic substan\ntive legal standards governing this case. This Court rec\nognized in Turner that imprisonment does not automati\ncally deprive a prisoner of certain important constitutional\nprotections, including those of the First Amendment. Id.,\nat 93; see also O\u2019Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U. S. 342,\n348 (1987). But at the same time the Constitution some\ntimes permits greater restriction of such rights in a prison\nthan it would allow elsewhere. See, e.g., Turner, supra, at\n84\u201385. As Overton (summarizing pre-Turner case law)\npointed out, courts owe \u201csubstantial deference to the\nprofessional judgment of prison administrators.\u201d 539\nU. S., at 132. And Turner reconciled these principles by\nholding that restrictive prison regulations are permissible\nif they are \u201c\u2018reasonably related\u2019 to legitimate penological\ninterests,\u201d 482 U. S., at 87, and are not an \u201cexaggerated\nresponse\u201d to such objectives, ibid.\n    Turner also sets forth four factors \u201crelevant in determin\ning the reasonableness of the regulation at issue.\u201d Id., at\n89. First, is there a \u201c \u2018valid, rational connection\u2019 between\nthe prison regulation and the legitimate governmental\ninterest put forward to justify it\u201d? Ibid. Second, are there\n\u201calternative means of exercising the right that remain\nopen to prison inmates\u201d? Id., at 90. Third, what \u201cimpact\u201d\nwill \u201caccommodation of the asserted constitutional right\n. . . have on guards and other inmates, and on the alloca\ntion of prison resources generally\u201d? Ibid. And, fourth, are\n\u201cready alternatives\u201d for furthering the governmental\n6                      BEARD v. BANKS\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ninterest available? Ibid.\n   This case has arrived in this Court in the context of the\nSecretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Thus we must\nexamine the record to see whether the Secretary, in depo\nsitions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, affidavits\nand the like, has demonstrated \u201cthe absence of a genuine\nissue of material fact\u201d and his entitlement to judgment as\na matter of law. See, e.g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56; Celotex\nCorp. v. Catrett, 477 U.

If not, the\nlaw requires entry of judgment in the Secretary\u2019s favor. See\nCelotex Corp., supra, at 322 (Rule 56 \u201cmandates the entry\nof summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery\nand upon motion, against a party who fails to make a\nshowing sufficient to establish the existence of an element\nessential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will\nbear the burden of proof at trial\u201d).\n   We recognize that at this stage we must draw \u201call justifi\nable inferences\u201d in Banks\u2019 \u201cfavor.\u201d Anderson v.

Unless a prisoner can\npoint to sufficient evidence regarding such issues of judg\nment to allow him to prevail on the merits, he cannot pre\nvail at the summary judgment stage.\n                            III\n    The Secretary in his motion set forth several justifica\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

We need go no\nfurther than the first justification, that of providing in\ncreased incentives for better prison behavior. Applying\nthe well-established substantive and procedural standards\nset forth in Part II, we find, on the basis of the record\nbefore us, that the Secretary\u2019s justification is adequate.\nAnd that finding here warrants summary judgment in the\nSecretary\u2019s favor.\n                               A\n   The Secretary rested his motion for summary judgment\nprimarily upon the statement of undisputed facts along\nwith Deputy Prison Superintendent Dickson\u2019s affidavit.\nThe statement of undisputed facts says that the LTSU\u2019s\n40 inmates, about 0.01 percent of the total prison popula\ntion, constitute the \u201c \u2018worst of the worst,\u2019 \u201d those who \u201chave\nproven by the history of their behavior in prison, the\nnecessity of holding them in the rigorous regime of con\nfinement\u201d of the LTSU. App. 26. It then sets forth three\n\u201cpenological rationales\u201d for the Policy, summarized from\nthe Dickson deposition:\n     (1) to \u201cmotivat[e]\u201d better \u201cbehavior\u201d on the part of\n    these \u201cparticularly difficult prisoners,\u201d by providing\n    them with an incentive to move to level 1, or out of the\n    LTSU altogether, and to \u201cdiscourage backsliding\u201d on\n    the part of level 1 inmates;\n     (2) to minimize the amount of property controlled by\n    the prisoners, on the theory that the \u201cless property\n    these high maintenance, high supervision, obdurate\n    troublemakers have, the easier it is for . . . correc\n    tional officer[s] to detect concealed contraband [and]\n8                     BEARD v. BANKS\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n    to provide security\u201d; and\n    (3) to diminish the amount of material (in particular\n    newspapers and magazines) that prisoners might use\n    as weapons of attack in the form of \u201c \u2018spears\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018blow\n    guns,\u2019 \u201d or that they could employ \u201cas tools to catapult\n    feces at the guards without the necessity of soiling\n    one\u2019s own hands,\u201d or use \u201cas tinder for cell fires.\u201d Id.,\n    at 27.\n   As we have said we believe that the first rationale itself\nsatisfies Turner\u2019s requirements. First, the statement and\ndeposition set forth a \u201c \u2018valid, rational connection\u2019 \u201d be\ntween the Policy and \u201c \u2018legitimate penological objectives.\u2019 \u201d\n482 U. S., at 89, 95. The deputy superintendent stated in\nhis deposition that prison authorities are \u201cvery limited . . .\nin what we can and cannot deny or give to [a level 2]\ninmate [who typically has already been deprived of almost\nall privileges, see supra, at 2\u20133], and these are some of the\nitems that we feel are legitimate as incentives for inmate\ngrowth.\u201d App. 190. The statement of undisputed facts\n(relying on the deposition) added that the Policy \u201cserves to\nencourage . . . progress and discourage backsliding by the\nlevel 1 inmates.\u201d Id., at 27.\n   These statements point to evidence\u2014namely, the views\nof the deputy superintendent\u2014that the regulations do, in\nfact, serve the function identified. The articulated connec\ntions between newspapers and magazines, the deprivation\nof virtually the last privilege left to an inmate, and\na significant incentive to improve behavior, are\nlogical ones. Thus, the first factor supports the Policy\u2019s\n\u201creasonableness.\u201d\n   As to the second factor, the statement and deposition\nmake clear that, as long as the inmate remains at level 2,\nno \u201calternative means of exercising the right\u201d remain open\nto him. Turner, supra, at 90. After 90 days the prisoner\nmay be able to graduate to level 1 and thus regain his\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

In the approximately 2 \u00bd\nyears after the LTSU opened, about 25 percent of those\nconfined to level 2 did graduate to level 1 or out of the\nLTSU altogether. App. 138; Reply Brief for Petitioner 8.\nBut these circumstances simply limit, they do not elimi\nnate, the fact that there is no alternative. The absence of\nany alternative thus provides \u201csome evidence that the\nregulations [a]re unreasonable,\u201d but is not \u201cconclusive\u201d of\nthe reasonableness of the Policy. Overton, 539 U. S., at\n135.\n   As to the third factor, the statement and deposition\nindicate that, were prison authorities to seek to \u201caccom\nmodat[e] . . . the asserted constitutional right,\u201d the result\ning \u201cimpact\u201d would be negative. That circumstance is also\ninherent in the nature of the Policy: If the Policy (in the\nauthorities\u2019 view) helps to produce better behavior, then\nits absence (in the authorities\u2019 view) will help to produce\nworse behavior, e.g., \u201cbacksliding\u201d (and thus the expendi\nture of more \u201cresources\u201d at level 2). Turner, 482 U. S., at\n90. Similarly, as to the fourth factor, neither the state\nment nor the deposition describes, points to, or calls to\nmind any \u201calternative method of accommodating the\nclaimant\u2019s constitutional complaint . . . that fully accom\nmodates the prisoner\u2019s rights at de minimis cost to valid\npenological interests.\u201d Id., at 90\u201391.\n   In fact, the second, third, and fourth factors, being in a\nsense logically related to the Policy itself, here add little,\none way or another, to the first factor\u2019s basic logical ra\ntionale. See post, at 6 (opinion of STEVENS, J.) (noting that\n\u201cdeprivation theory does not map easily onto several of the\nTurner factors\u201d), cf. post, at 5-6 (opinion of THOMAS, J.)\n(similar). The fact that two of these latter three factors\nseem to support the Policy does not, therefore, count in the\nSecretary\u2019s favor. The real task in this case is not balanc\ning these factors, but rather determining whether the\nSecretary shows more than simply a logical relation, that\n10                    BEARD v. BANKS\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nis, whether he shows a reasonable relation. We believe the\nmaterial presented here by the prison officials is sufficient\nto demonstrate that the Policy is a reasonable one.\n   Overton provides significant support for this conclusion.\nIn Overton we upheld a prison\u2019s \u201csevere\u201d restriction on the\nfamily visitation privileges of prisoners with repeat sub\nstance abuse violations. 539 U. S., at 134. Despite the\nimportance of the rights there at issue, we held that with\nholding such privileges \u201cis a proper and even necessary\nmanagement technique to induce compliance with the\nrules of inmate behavior, especially for high-security\nprisoners who have few other privileges to lose.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Policy and circumstances here are not identical, but\nwe have not found differences that are significant. In both\ncases, the deprivations at issue (all visits with close family\nmembers; all access to newspapers, magazines, and pho\ntos) have an important constitutional dimension. In both\ncases, prison officials have imposed the deprivation at\nissue only upon those with serious prison-behavior prob\nlems (here the 40 most intractable inmates in the Com\nmonwealth). In both cases, prison officials, relying on\ntheir professional judgment, reached an experience-based\nconclusion that the policies help to further legitimate\nprison objectives.\n   The upshot is that, if we consider the Secretary\u2019s sup\nporting materials, i.e., the statement and deposition), by\nthemselves, they provide sufficient justification for the\nPolicy. That is to say, unless there is more, they bring the\nPolicy within Turner\u2019s legitimating scope.\n                            B\n  Although summary judgment rules provided Banks with\nan opportunity to respond to the Secretary\u2019s materials, he\ndid not offer any fact-based or expert-based refutation in\nthe manner the rules provide. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(e)\n                   Cite as: 548 U.

Instead, Banks filed his own cross-\nmotion for summary judgment in which he claimed that\nthe Policy fell of its own weight, i.e., that the Policy was\n\u201cunreasonable as a matter of law.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief in\nSupport of Motion for Summary Judgment in C. A. 01\u2013\n1956 (WD Pa.), p. 13 (hereinafter Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief). In\nparticular, Banks argued (and continues to argue) that the\nPolicy lacks any significant incentive effect given the\nhistory of incorrigibility of the inmates concerned and the\noverall deprivations associated with the LTSU, Brief for\nRespondent 22; Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief 13. He points in support\nto certain court opinions that he believes reflect expert\nviews that favor his position. Abdul Wali v. Coughlin, 754\nF. 2d 1015, 1034 (CA2 1985); Bieregu v. Reno, 59 F. 3d\n1445, 1449 (CA3 1995); Knecht v. Collins, 903 F. Supp.\n1193, 1200 (SD Ohio 1995), aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part,\nvacated in part, 187 F. 3d 636 (CA6 1999). And he adds\nthat only about one-quarter of level 2 inmates graduate\nout of that environment.\n   The cases to which Banks refers, however, simply point\nout that, in the view of some courts, increased contact with\nthe world generally favors rehabilitation. See Abdul Wali,\nsupra, at 1034; Bieregu, supra, at 1449; Knecht, supra, at\n1200. That circumstance, as written about in court opin\nions, cannot provide sufficient support, particularly as\nthese courts were not considering contexts such as this\none, where prison officials are dealing with especially\ndifficult prisoners. Neither can Banks find the necessary\nassistance in the fact that only one-quarter or so of the\nlevel 2 population graduates to level 1 or out of the LTSU.\nGiven the incorrigibility of level 2 inmates\u2014which peti\ntioner himself admits\u2014there is nothing to indicate that a\n25 percent graduation rate is low, rather than, as the\nSecretary suggests, acceptably high.\n12                    BEARD v. BANKS\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n   We recognize that the Court of Appeals reached a con\ntrary conclusion. But in doing so, it placed too high an\nevidentiary burden upon the Secretary. In respect to\nbehavior-modification incentives, for example, the court\nwrote that the \u201cDistrict Court did not examine . . .\nwhether the ban was implemented in a way that could\nmodify behavior, or inquire into whether the [Department\nof Corrections\u2019] deprivation theory of behavior modifica\ntion had any basis in real human psychology, or had\nproven effective with LTSU inmates.\u201d 399 F. 3d, at 142.\nAnd, the court phrased the relevant conclusions in terms\nthat placed a high summary judgment evidentiary burden\nupon the Secretary, i.e., the moving party. See, e.g., id., at\n141 (\u201c[W]e cannot say that the [defendant] has shown how\nthe regulations in this case serve [an incentive-related]\npurpose\u201d). The court\u2019s statements and conclusions here\nalso offer too little deference to the judgment of prison\nofficials about such matters. The court, for example,\noffered no apparent deference to the deputy prison super\nintendent\u2019s professional judgment that the Policy deprived\n\u201cparticularly difficult\u201d inmates of a last remaining privi\nlege and that doing so created a significant behavioral\nincentive.\n   Contrary to JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s suggestion, post, at 2\u2013\n4, we do not suggest that the deference owed prison au\nthorities makes it impossible for prisoners or others at\ntacking a prison policy like the present one ever to succeed\nor to survive summary judgment. After all, the constitu\ntional interest here is an important one. Turner requires\nprison authorities to show more than a formalistic logical\nconnection between a regulation and a penological objec\ntive. A prisoner may be able to marshal substantial evi\ndence that, given the importance of the interest, the Policy\nis not a reasonable one. Cf. 482 U. S., at 97\u201399 (striking\ndown prison policy prohibiting prisoner marriages). And\nwith or without the assistance that public interest law\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

Finally, as in Overton, we agree that \u201cthe\nrestriction here is severe,\u201d and \u201cif faced with evidence that\n[it were] a de facto permanent ban . . . we might well reach\na different conclusion in a challenge to a particular appli\ncation of the regulation.\u201d 539 U.

Just last Term, this Court invalidated\nCalifornia\u2019s policy of racially segregating prisoners in its\nreception centers, notwithstanding that State\u2019s warning\nthat its policy was necessary to prevent prison violence.\nSee Johnson v. California, 543 U. S. 499 (2005). California\nsubsequently experienced several instances of severe race-\nbased prison violence, including a riot that resulted in 2\nfatalities and more than 100 injuries, and significant fight\ning along racial lines between newly arrived inmates, the\nvery inmates that were subject to the policy invalidated by\nthe Court in Johnson. See Winton & Bernstein, More Vio\nlence Erupts at Pitchess; Black and Latino inmates clash at\nthe north county jail, leaving 13 injured, Los Angeles Times,\nMar. 1, 2006, Metro Desk, p. B1. This powerful reminder of\nthe grave dangers inherent in prison administration con\nfirms my view that the framework I set forth in Overton v.\nBazzetta, 539 U. S. 126, 138 (2003) (opinion concurring in\njudgment), is the least perilous approach for resolving chal\nlenges to prison regulations, as well as the approach that is\nmost faithful to the Constitution. Accordingly, I concur only\n2                         BEARD v. BANKS\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nin the judgment of the Court.\n                               I\n   Both the plurality and the dissent evaluate the regula\ntions challenged in this case pursuant to the approach set\nforth in Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78 (1987), which permits\nprison regulations that \u201cimping[e] on inmates\u2019 constitu\ntional rights\u201d if the regulations are \u201creasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests.\u201d Id., at 89. But as I\nexplained in Overton, Turner and its progeny \u201crest on the\nunstated (and erroneous) presumption that the Constitu\ntion contains an implicit definition of incarceration.\u201d\nOverton, 539 U. S., at 139 (opinion concurring in judg\nment). Because the Constitution contains no such defini\ntion, \u201cStates are free to define and redefine all types of\npunishment, including imprisonment, to encompass vari\nous types of deprivations\u2014provided only that those depri\nvations are consistent with the Eighth Amendment.\u201d Ibid.\n(emphasis in original). Respondent has not challenged\nPennsylvania\u2019s prison policy as a violation of the Eighth\nAmendment, and thus the sole inquiry in this case is\nwhether respondent\u2019s sentence deprived him of the rights\nhe now seeks to exercise. Id., at 140.\n   \u201cWhether a sentence encompasses the extinction of a\nconstitutional right enjoyed by free persons turns on state\nlaw, for it is a State\u2019s prerogative to determine how it will\npunish violations of its law.\u201d Ibid.1 Although the question\nof whether Pennsylvania intended to confer upon respon\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 As in Overton, respondent has not asked this Court to abstain from\n\nresolving his constitutional challenge under Railroad Comm\u2019n of Tex. v.\nPullman Co., 312 U. S. 496 (1941) (holding that federal courts should\nordinarily abstain where the resolution of a federal constitutional issue\nmay be rendered irrelevant by the determination of a predicate state-law\nquestion), and the issue of Pullman abstention was not considered below.\nAs a result, respondent has \u201csubmitted to the sort of guesswork about the\nmeaning of prison sentences that is the hallmark of the Turner inquiry.\u201d\nOverton, 539 U.

Id., at 141.\nFortunately, the answer is straightforward.\n  In Overton, I explained:\n    \u201c[s]entencing a criminal to a term of imprisonment\n    may, under state law, carry with it the implied dele\n    gation to prison officials to discipline and otherwise\n    supervise the criminal while he is incarcerated. Thus,\n    restrictions imposed by prison officials may also be a\n    part of the sentence, provided that those officials are\n    not acting ultra vires with respect to the discretion\n    given them, by implication, in the sentence.\u201d Id., at\n    140, n. *\nA term of imprisonment in Pennsylvania includes such\nan implied delegation. Pennsylvania inmates are subject\nto the rules and disciplinary measures set forth by\nthe Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. See, e.g.,\nBulletin Inmate Discipline, Policy No. DC\u2013ADM 801\n(2004), http://www.cor.state.pa.us/standards/lib/standards/\nDC-ADM_801_Inmate_Discipline.pdf (as visited June 12,\n2006, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). And no\none disputes that the regulations challenged in the instant\nlitigation fall within the discretion given to the Depart\nment of Corrections. As in Overton, the conclusion that\nthese regulations are included in the prison sentence is\nstrongly supported by the plurality\u2019s Turner analysis.

In applying the first\nTurner factor, the plurality correctly observes that Penn\nsylvania\u2019s policy of depriving its most incorrigible inmates\nof their last few remaining privileges bears a \u201cvalid ra\ntional connection\u201d to the \u201clegitimate penological objec\ntiv[e]\u201d of \u201cencourag[ing] progress and discourag[ing] back\nsliding\u201d of inmate compliance with prison rules.

Indeed, this\nCourt has previously determined that \u201c[w]ithdrawing . . .\nprivileges is a proper and even necessary management\ntechnique to induce compliance with the rules of inmate\nbehavior, especially for high-security prisoners.\u201d Overton,\nsupra, at 134.2\n   Although policies, such as Pennsylvania\u2019s, that seek to\npromote compliance with prison rules by withdrawing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 In my view, this legal conclusion, combined with the deference to\nthe judgment of prison officials required under Turner, see ante, at 8\u2013\n15, would entitle prison officials to summary judgment against chal\nlenges to their inmate prison deprivation policies in virtually every\ncase. In this context, it is highly unlikely a prisoner could establish\nthat the \u201cconnection between the regulation and the asserted goal is\narbitrary or irrational.\u201d Shaw v. Murphy, 532 U.

Such policies, by\ndesign, do not provide an \u201calternative means\u201d for inmates\nto exercise the rights they have been deprived. 482 U. S.,\nat 90. The \u201clegitimate penological objectiv[e]\u201d of encourag\ning compliance with prison rules by depriving misbehav\ning inmates of various privileges simply cannot be accom\nplished if prison officials are required to provide prisoners\nwith an alternative and equivalent set of privileges. Thus,\nthe plurality\u2019s observation that respondent\u2019s privileges\nmay be restored in response to continued, improved behav\nior, is simply irrelevant to the second factor of Turner,\nwhich asks only \u201cwhether . . . alternative means of exercis\ning the right . . . remain open to prison inmates.\u201d Ibid.\nThe answer in the context of privilege deprivation policies\nis always no, thus demonstrating the difficulty of analyz\ning such policies under the Turner framework.\n   The third and fourth Turner factors are likewise poorly\nsuited to determining the validity of inmate privilege\ndeprivation policies. When the \u201cvalid penological objec\ntiv[e]\u201d of a prison policy is encouraging compliance with\nprison rules, it makes little sense to inquire into \u201cthe\nimpact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right\nwill have on guards and other inmates, and on the alloca\ntion of prison resources generally,\u201d or into the availability\nof \u201cready alternatives.\u201d Ibid. At best, such inquiries\nmerely collapse the third and fourth factors into the first,\nbecause accommodating the exercise of the deprived right\nwill undermine the incentive effects of the prison policy\nand because the unavailability of \u201cready alternatives\u201d is\ntypically (as in this case) one of the underlying rationales\nfor the adoption of inmate privilege deprivation policies.\n                       *     *   *\n  Because the prison regulations at issue today are per\nmissible under the approach I explained in Overton, I\nconcur in the judgment of the Court.\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

In addition,\nunder the challenged rule, any personal photograph, includ\ning those of spouses, children, deceased parents, or inspira\ntional mentors, will be treated as contraband and confis\ncated.

Plainly, the rule at issue in this case strikes at the\ncore of the First Amendment rights to receive, to read, and\nto think.\n   Petitioner does not dispute that the prohibition at issue\ninfringes upon rights protected by the First Amendment.\nInstead, petitioner posits two penological interests, which,\nin his view, are sufficient to justify the challenged rule\nnotwithstanding these constitutional infringements:\nprison security and inmate rehabilitation. Although these\ninterests are certainly valid, petitioner has failed to estab\nlish, as a matter of law, that the challenged rule is rea\nsonably related to these interests. Accordingly, the Court\nof Appeals properly denied petitioner\u2019s motion for sum\nmary judgment, and this Court errs by intervening to\nprevent a trial.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

Many of these\n    items are flammable, could be used [to start fires,\n    catapult feces, or to create other dangers] as effec\n    tively as a newspaper, magazine or photograph, and\n    have been so used by [LTSU\u20132] inmates.\u201d 399 F. 3d\n    134, 143 (2005) (case below).\n  In fact, the amount of potentially dangerous material to\nwhich LTSU-2 inmates are seeking access is quite small in\ncomparison to the amount of material that they already\npossess in their cells. As the Court of Appeals empha\nsized, LTSU-2 inmates \u201care not requesting unlimited\naccess to innumerable periodicals,\u201d rather, they are seek\ning \u201cthe ability to have one newspaper or magazine and\nsome small number of photographs in their cells at one\ntime.\u201d 399 F. 3d, at 144 (emphasis added). In light of the\nquantity of materials that LTSU\u20132 inmates are entitled to\nhave in their cell, it does not follow, as a matter of logic,\nthat preventing inmates from possessing a single copy of a\nsecular, nonlegal newspaper, newsletter, or magazine will\nhave any measurable effect on the likelihood that inmates\nwill start fires, hide contraband, or engage in other dan\n4                        BEARD v.

(invalidating a county jail\u2019s\nban on newspapers and magazines because, \u201c[i]n view of\nthe jail\u2019s policy of allowing inmates to possess other mate\nrial that was flammable and capable of being used to\ninterfere with the plumbing,\u201d the rule was \u201ctoo underin\nclusive\u201d to be constitutional).1\n  Moreover, there is no record evidence in this case to\nsupport a contrary conclusion. Deputy Superintendent\nJoel Dickson, whose deposition is a major part of the\nsparse record before us, did not identify any dangerous\nbehavior that would be more likely to occur if LTSU-2\ninmates obtained the limited access to periodicals that\nthey are seeking. He did, however, make clear that in\nmates could engage in any of the behaviors that worried\nprison officials without using banned materials:\n     \u201cQ. Wouldn\u2019t it be fair to say that if an inmate wants\n     to start a fire, he could start a fire using writing paper\n     in combination with a blanket or in combination with\n     clothing or linen, bedding materials? He could do\n     that; couldn\u2019t he?\n     \u201cA. Yes.\n     \u201cQ. If he wants to throw feces, he could use a cup for\n     that; true?\n     \u201cA. Yes.\n     \u201cQ.

Yes.\u201d App. 196\u2013197.2\n   The security-based justification for the ban on personal\nphotographs is even weaker. There is not a single state\nment in Superintendent Dickson\u2019s deposition suggesting\nthat prisoners have used, or would be likely to use, photo\ngraphic paper to start fires or hurl excrement. Cf. id., at\n196 (stating that paper products are generally used to\nstart fires).\n   Perhaps, at trial, petitioner could introduce additional\nevidence supporting his view that the challenged regula\ntion is in fact reasonably likely to enhance security or that\nrespondent\u2019s request for limited access to newspapers and\nphotographs would, for some as yet undisclosed reason,\nrequire an unduly burdensome expenditure of resources\non the part of prison officials. However, the above discus\nsion makes clear that, at the very least, \u201creasonable minds\ncould differ as to the import of the evidence\u201d introduced\nthus far concerning the relationship between the chal\nlenged regulation and petitioner\u2019s posited security inter\nest, Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S. 242, 250\n(1986). Accordingly, petitioner\u2019s valid interest in security\nis not sufficient to warrant judgment as a matter of law.\nSee id., at 250\u2013251.\n   The second rationale posited by petitioner in support of\nthe prohibitions on newspapers, newsletters, magazines,\nand photographs is rehabilitation. According to petitioner,\nthe ban \u201cprovides the [l]evel 2 inmates with the prospect of\nearning a privilege through compliance with orders and\nremission of various negative behaviors and serves to\nencourage the progress and discourage backsliding by the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 See also App. 194 (\u201cI would say there\u2019s any number of ways [LTSU\u2013\n\n2 inmates hurl feces]. Oftentimes it\u2019s with the cups that they\u2019re given\nfor their drinks, things like that, any type of container; or . . . a piece of\npaper or whatever wrapped up that they can use to give a little lever\nage and fling the materials.\u201d).\n6                      BEARD v.

In the plurality\u2019s view, in light\nof the present record, this rationale is sufficient to warrant\na reversal of the judgment below.\n   Rehabilitation is undoubtedly a legitimate penological\ninterest. However, the particular theory of rehabilitation\nat issue in this case presents a special set of concerns for\ncourts considering whether a prison regulation is consis\ntent with the First Amendment. Specifically, petitioner\nadvances a deprivation theory of rehabilitation: Any dep\nrivation of something a prisoner desires gives him an\nadded incentive to improve his behavior. This justification\nhas no limiting principle; if sufficient, it would provide a\n\u201crational basis\u201d for any regulation that deprives a prisoner\nof a constitutional right so long as there is at least a theo\nretical possibility that the prisoner can regain the right at\nsome future time by modifying his behavior. See Kimber\nlin v. United States Dept. of Justice, 318 F. 3d 228, 240\n(CADC 2003) (per curiam) (Tatel, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part) (noting that \u201cregulations that\ndeprive prisoners of their constitutional rights will always\nbe rationally related to the goal of making prison more\nmiserable\u201d). Indeed, the more important the constitu\ntional right at stake (at least from the prisoners\u2019 perspec\ntive), the stronger the justification for depriving prisoners\nof that right. The plurality admits as much: \u201cIf the policy\n(in the authorities\u2019 view) helps to produce better behavior,\nthen its absence (in the authorities\u2019 view) will help to\nproduce worse behavior. . . .\u201d Ante, at 9.\n   Not surprisingly, as JUSTICE THOMAS recognizes, see\nante, at 5-6, this deprivation theory does not map easily\nonto several of the Turner factors, which are premised on\nprison officials presenting a secondary effects type ration\nale in support of a challenged regulation. For instance,\nunder the deprivation theory of rehabilitation, there could\nnever be a \u201cready alternative\u201d for furthering the govern\nment interest, because the government interest is tied\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ndirectly to depriving the prisoner of the constitutional\nright at issue.\n   Indeed, the strong form of the deprivation theory of\nrehabilitation would mean that the prison rule we invali\ndated in Turner would have survived constitutional scru\ntiny if the State had simply posited an interest in rehabili\ntating prisoners through deprivation. In Turner, we held\nthat a Missouri regulation that forbade inmates from\nmarrying except with the permission of the prison super\nintendent was facially unconstitutional. See 482 U. S., at\n97\u201399. We rejected the State\u2019s proffered security and\nrehabilitation concerns as not reasonably related to the\nmarriage ban. See ibid. Taken to its logical conclusion,\nhowever, the deprivation theory of rehabilitation would\nmean that the marriage ban in Turner could be justified\nbecause the prohibition furnished prisoners with an incen\ntive to behave well and thus earn early release. Cf. Safley\nv. Turner, 586 F. Supp. 589, 593 (WD Mo. 1984) (noting\nthat, under the Missouri regulations partially invalidated\nby Turner, 482 U. S. 78, inmates had been threatened\nwith the loss of parole for attempting to exercise their\nmarriage rights).\n   In sum, rehabilitation is a valid penological interest,\nand deprivation is undoubtedly one valid tool in promoting\nrehabilitation. Nonetheless, to ensure that Turner contin\nues to impose meaningful limits on the promulgation of\nrules that infringe upon inmates\u2019 constitutional rights, see\nThornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U. S. 401, 414 (1989) (stating\nthat Turner\u2019s reasonableness standard \u201cis not toothless\u201d),\ncourts must be especially cautious in evaluating the con\nstitutionality of prison regulations that are supposedly\njustified primarily on that basis. When, as here, a reason\nable factfinder could conclude that challenged deprivations\nhave a tenuous logical connection to rehabilitation, or are\nexaggerated responses to a prison\u2019s legitimate interest in\nrehabilitation, prison officials are not entitled to judgment\n8                         BEARD v. BANKS\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nas a matter of law.\n   Petitioner argues that, because the various deprivations\nin the levels of disciplinary confinement short of LTSU\u20132\nare also severe, prison officials have no choice but to de\nprive inmates of core constitutional rights in LTSU\u20132 in\norder to make LTSU\u20132 more unattractive than other types\nof segregation. The fact that most States and the Federal\nGovernment run their prisons without resorting to the\ntype of ban at issue in this case, see Brief for American\nCivil Liberties Union et al. as Amici Curiae 21,3 casts\nserious doubt upon the need for the challenged constitu\ntional deprivations.\n   In any event, if we consider the severity of the other\nconditions of confinement in LTSU\u20132, it becomes obvious\nthat inmates have a powerful motivation to escape those\nconditions irrespective of the ban on newspapers, maga\nzines, and personal photographs. Inmates in LTSU\u20132 face\n23 hours a day in solitary confinement, are allowed only\none visitor per month, may not make phone calls except in\ncases of emergency, lack any access to radio or television,\nmay not use the prison commissary, are not permitted\nGeneral Educational Development (GED) or special educa\ntion study, and may not receive compensation under the\ninmate compensation system if they work as a unit jani\ntor. Although conditions in LTSU\u20131 are also harsh, in\nseveral respects unrelated to the challenged regulation,\nthey are far more appealing than the conditions in LTSU\u2013\n2. LTSU\u20131 inmates may have two visitors and may make\none phone call per month; they have access to the commis\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 This is presumably the type of evidence the plurality suggests that\n\nrespondent should have presented through an affidavit or deposition in\nresponse to petitioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment. See Jacklovich\nv. Simmons, 392 F. 3d 420, 428\u2013429 (CA10 2004) (noting that plaintiffs\nchallenging a prison regulation that limited access to publications had\nintroduced such evidence and concluding that prison officials were not\nentitled to summary judgment).\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

See App. 43, 102;\n399 F. 3d, at 148 (case below). The logical conclusion from\nthis is that, even if LTSU\u20132 prisoners were not deprived of\naccess to newspapers and personal photographs, they\nwould still have a strong incentive to gain promotion to\nLTSU\u20131.\n   In addition, prisoners in LTSU\u20131 do not regain access to\npersonal photographs, which means that the ban on pho\ntographs cannot be justified by petitioner\u2019s \u201c \u2018hope\u2019 \u201d that\ninmates will respond to the constitutional deprivations in\nLTSU\u20132 by improving their behavior so they may gradu\nate into LTSU\u20131, 399 F. 3d, at 142 (quoting petitioner\u2019s\ncounsel). Prisoners who \u201cgraduate\u201d out of the LTSU\u20131\nand back into the general prison population do regain\ntheir right to possess personal photographs, but they also\nregain so many additional privileges\u2014from ending their\nsolitary confinement to regaining access to television and\nradio\u2014that it strains credulity to believe that that the\npossibility of regaining the right to possess personal pho\ntographs if they eventually return to the general prison\npopulation would have any marginal effect on the actions\nof prisoners in LTSU\u20132.\n   In sum, the logical connection between the ban on news\npapers and (especially) the ban on personal photographs,\non one hand, and the rehabilitation interests posited by\npetitioner, on the other, is at best highly questionable.\nMoreover, petitioner did not introduce evidence that his\nproposed theory of behavior modification has any basis in\nhuman psychology, or that the challenged rule has in fact\nhad any rehabilitative effect on LTSU\u20132 inmates. Ibid.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 I emphasize the lack of evidentiary support for petitioner\u2019s position\n\nbecause I believe that, in light of the record currently before the Court,\n10                           BEARD v. BANKS\n\n                          STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nAccordingly, at least based on the present state of the\nrecord, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that prison\ners would have a sufficiently powerful incentive to gradu\nate out of LTSU\u20132 even absent the challenged rule, such\nthat the rule is not likely to have any appreciable behavior\nmodification effect.\n   The temporal character of LTSU\u20132 status further un\ndermines petitioner\u2019s argument that the ban on newspa\npers and photographs at issue in this case is reasonably\nrelated to a legitimate penological interest. All LTSU\ninmates must spend 90 days in LTSU\u20132 status. After\nthat, they receive a review every 30 days to determine if\nthey should be promoted to LTSU\u20131. That determination\nis made at the discretion of prison administrators, and is\nnot linked to any specific infraction or compliance. Peti\ntioner acknowledges that \u201c[a]n inmate in the LTSU can\nremain on Level 2 status indefinitely.\u201d App. 26. Indeed,\nas of August 2002, which is the most recent date for which\nthere is record evidence, roughly three-quarters of inmates\nplaced in LTSU\u20132 had remained in that status since the\ninception of the LTSU program over two years earlier.

In\nshort, as the Court of Appeals explained:\n     \u201c[T]he LTSU Level 2 is a unique kind of segregation\n     with characteristics of both disciplinary and adminis\n     trative segregation. Inmates come to LTSU because\n     of \u2018unacceptable behaviors\u2019 in other institutions, but\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe logical connection between petitioner\u2019s stated interest in rehabilita\ntion and the prohibition on newspapers and photographs is exceedingly\ntenuous. When the logical connection between prison officials\u2019 stated\ninterests and the restrictions on prisoners\u2019 constitutional rights is not self-\nevident, we have considered whether prison officials proffered any evi\ndence that their regulations served the values they identified. See, e.g.,\nTurner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 98 (1987) (discussing lack of evidence in the\nrecord to support a ban on marriage as related to prison officials\u2019 stated\nobjectives).\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            11\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n    they have not all been adjudicated by a hearing officer\n    to have violated the [Department of Corrections\u2019]\n    rules. The LTSU is not a place where inmates are\n    sent for a discrete period of punishment, pursuant to a\n    specific infraction, but is a place for \u2018Long Term\u2019 seg\n    regation of the most incorrigible and difficult prison\n    ers for as long as they fall under that umbrella.\u201d 399\n    F. 3d, at 141 (citation omitted).\n   The indefinite nature of LTSU\u20132 confinement, and the\nfact that as of August 2002 a significant majority of in\nmates confined at LTSU\u20132 had remained there since the\ninception of the program over two years earlier, suggest\nthat the prohibition on newspapers, magazines, and per\nsonal photographs is an exaggerated response to the\nprison\u2019s legitimate interest in rehabilitation. It would be a\ndifferent case if prison officials had promulgated a regula\ntion that deprived LTSU-2 inmates of certain First\nAmendment rights for a short period of time in response to\nspecific disciplinary infractions. The indefinite depriva\ntions at issue here, however, obviously impose a much\ngreater burden on inmates\u2019 ability to exercise their consti\ntutional rights. Absent evidence that these indefinite\ndeprivations will be more effective in achieving rehabilita\ntion than shorter periods of deprivation, a reasonable\nfactfinder could conclude that the challenged regulation\n\u201csweeps much more broadly than can be explained by\n[prison officials\u2019] penological objectives,\u201d Turner, 482 U. S.,\nat 98, and is hence an exaggerated response to petitioner\u2019s\nlegitimate interest in rehabilitation.\n   In short, as with regard to the current state of the re\ncord concerning the connection between the challenged\nregulation and its effect on prison security, the record is\ninsufficient to conclude, as a matter of law, that petitioner\nhas established a reasonable relationship between his\nvalid interest in inmate rehabilitation and the prohibition\n12                     BEARD v.

The\nState may not \u201c \u2018invad[e] the sphere of intellect and spirit\nwhich it is the purpose of the First Amendment of our\nConstitution to reserve from all official control.\u2019 \u201d Wooley\nv. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705, 715 (1977) (quoting West Vir\nginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 642 (1943)). In\nthis case, the complete prohibition on secular, nonlegal\nnewspapers, newsletters, and magazines prevents prison\ners from \u201creceiv[ing] suitable access to social, political,\nesthetic, moral, and other ideas,\u201d which are central to the\ndevelopment and preservation of individual identity, and\nare clearly protected by the First Amendment, Red Lion\nBroadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 390 (1969). Simi\nlarly, the ban on personal photographs, for at least some\ninmates, interferes with the capacity to remember loved\nones, which is undoubtedly a core part of a person\u2019s \u201csphere\nof intellect and spirit.\u201d Moreover, it is difficult to imagine a\ncontext in which these First Amendment infringements\ncould be more severe; LTSU-2 inmates are in solitary con\nfinement for 23 hours a day with no access to radio or televi\nsion, are not permitted to make phone calls except in cases\nof emergency, and may only have one visitor per month.\nThey are essentially isolated from any meaningful contact\nwith the outside world. The severity of the constitutional\ndeprivations at issue in this case should give us serious\npause before concluding, as a matter of law, that the chal\nlenged regulation is consistent with the sovereign\u2019s duty to\ntreat prisoners in accordance with \u201cthe ethical tradition\nthat accords respect to the dignity and worth of every\nindividual.\u201d Overton v.

The Secretary relies on his own\nstatement of undisputed facts and the deposition of the\nprison\u2019s Deputy Superintendent. The deposition states\nthat \u201cobviously we are attempting to do the best we can to\nmodify the inmate\u2019s behavior so that eventually he can\nbecome a more productive citizen . . . . We\u2019re very limited\n. . . in what we can and cannot deny or give to an inmate,\nand [newspapers and photographs] are some of the items\nthat we feel are legitimate as incentives for inmate\ngrowth.\u201d App. 189, 190. The Secretary\u2019s statement of\nundisputed facts similarly asserts that the regulation\n\u201cserves to encourage . . . progress and discourage backslid\ning.\u201d Id., at 27.\n    These statements, the plurality holds, are sufficient to\nshow that the challenged regulation is reasonably related\nto inmate rehabilitation.

The regulation denies The Christian\nScience Monitor to inmates housed in level 2 of the\nprison\u2019s long-term segregation unit but allows them The\nJewish Daily Forward, based on the determination of a\nprison official that the latter qualifies as a religious publi\ncation and the former does not.

But in this case, the defender of\nthe regulation invites summary judgment. All inferences\nare to be drawn in favor of the prisoner opposing the regula\ntion, and the question is not which side has the better ar\ngument, but whether the Secretary has shown he is entitled\nto a judgment as a matter of law. By elevating the sum\nmary judgment opponent\u2019s burden to a height prisoners\nlacking nimble counsel cannot reach, the plurality effec\ntively tells prison officials they will succeed in cases of this\norder, and swiftly, while barely trying. It suffices for them\nto say, in our professional judgment the restriction is\nwarranted. The asserted right to read, see ante, at 1\u20132\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting), is indeed an \u201cimportant one,\u201d\nsee ante, at 12 (plurality opinion of BREYER, J.). Even in\nhighest security custody, a constitutional interest of that\norder merits more than peremptory treatment.\n                       *    *   *\n  For the reasons stated by JUSTICE STEVENS and in this\nopinion, I would affirm the Third Circuit\u2019s judgment re\nversing the award of summary judgment to the Secretary.\n",

Argued March 27, 2006\u2014Decided June 28, 2006\nPennsylvania houses its 40 most dangerous and recalcitrant inmates in\n  a Long Term Segregation Unit (LTSU). Inmates begin in level 2,\n  which has the most severe restrictions, but may graduate to the less\n  restrictive level 1. Plaintiff-respondent Banks, a level 2 inmate, filed\n  this federal-court action against defendant-petitioner, the Secretary\n  of the Department of Corrections, alleging that a level 2 policy (Pol\n  icy) forbidding inmates any access to newspapers, magazines, and\n  photographs violates the First Amendment. During discovery, Banks\n  deposed Deputy Prison Superintendent Dickson and the parties in\n  troduced prison policy manuals and related documents into the re\n  cord. The Secretary then filed a summary judgment motion, along\n  with a statement of undisputed facts and the deposition. Rather\n  than filing an opposition to the motion, Banks filed a cross-motion for\n  summary judgment, relying on the undisputed facts, including those\n  in the deposition. Based on this record, the District Court granted\n  the Secretary\u2019s motion and denied Banks\u2019. Reversing the Secretary\u2019s\n  summary judgment award, the Third Circuit held that the prison\n  regulation could not be supported as a matter of law.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n399 F. 3d 134, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE BREYER, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE KENNEDY,\n  and JUSTICE SOUTER, concluded that, based on the record before this\n  Court, prison officials have set forth adequate legal support for the\n  Policy, and Banks has failed to show specific facts that could warrant\n  a determination in his favor. Pp. 5\u201313.\n2                            BEARD v. BANKS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n       (a) Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, and Overton v. Bazzetta, 539\n    U. S. 126, contain the basic substantive legal standards covering this\n    case. While imprisonment does not automatically deprive a prisoner\n    of constitutional protections, Turner, 482 U. S., at 93, the Constitu\n    tion sometimes permits greater restriction of such rights in a prison\n    than it would allow elsewhere, id., at 84\u201385. As Overton, supra, at\n    132, pointed out, courts also owe \u201csubstantial deference to the profes\n    sional judgment of prison administrators.\u201d Under Turner, restrictive\n    prison regulations are permissible if they are \u201creasonably related to\n    legitimate penological interests.\u201d 482 U. S., at 89. Because this case\n    is here on the Secretary\u2019s summary judgment motion, the Court ex\n    amines the record to determine whether he has demonstrated \u201cthe\n    absence of a genuine issue of material fact\u201d and his entitlement to\n    judgment as a matter of law. See, e.g., Fed . Rule Civ. Proc. 56. If he\n    has, the Court determines whether Banks has \u201cby affidavits or as\n    otherwise provided\u201d in Rule 56, \u201cset forth specific facts showing . . . a\n    genuine issue for trial,\u201d Rule 56(e). Inferences about disputed facts\n    must be drawn in Banks\u2019 favor, but deference must be accorded\n    prison authorities\u2019 views with respect to matters of professional judg\n    ment. Pp. 5\u20136.\n       (b) The Secretary rested his motion primarily on the undisputed\n    facts statement and Dickson\u2019s affidavit. The first of his justifications\n    for the Policy\u2014the need to motivate better behavior on the part of\n    particularly difficult prisoners\u2014sufficiently satisfies Turner\u2019s re\n    quirements. The statement and affidavit set forth a \u201c \u2018valid, rational\n    connection \u2019 \u201d between the Policy and \u201c \u2018legitimate penological inter\n    ests,\u2019 \u201d 482 U. S., at 89, 95. Dickson noted that prison authorities are\n    limited in what they can and cannot deny or give a level 2 inmate,\n    who has already been deprived of most privileges, and that the offi\n    cials believe that the specified items are legitimate as incentives for\n    inmate growth. The undisputed facts statement added that the Pol\n    icy encourages progress and discourages backsliding by level 1 in\n    mates. These statements point to evidence that the regulations serve\n    the function identified. The articulated connections between news\n    papers and magazines, the deprivation of virtually the last privilege\n    left to an inmate, and a significant incentive to improve behavior, are\n    logical ones. Thus, this factor supports the Policy\u2019s \u201creasonableness.\u201d\n    The second, third, and fourth Turner factors\u2014whether there are \u201cal\n    ternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison\n    inmates,\u201d id., at 90; the \u201cimpact\u201d that accommodating \u201cthe asserted\n    constitutional right [will] have on guards and other inmates, and on\n    the allocation of prison resources,\u201d ibid.; and whether there are\n    \u201cready alternatives\u201d for furthering the governmental interest, ibid.\u2014\n    add little to the first factor\u2019s logical rationale here. That two of these\n                   Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nthree factors seem to favor the Policy therefore does not help the Sec\nretary. The real task in this case is not balancing the Turner factors\nbut determining whether the Secretary\u2019s summary judgment mate\nrial shows not just a logical relation but a reasonable relation. Given\nthe deference courts must show to prison officials\u2019 professional judg\nment, the material presented here is sufficient. Overton provides\nsignificant support for this conclusion. In both cases, the depriva\ntions (family visits in Overton and access to newspapers, magazines,\nand photographs here) have an important constitutional dimension;\nprison officials have imposed the deprivation only upon those with\nserious prison-behavior problems; and those officials, relying on their\nprofessional judgment, reached an experience-based conclusion that\nthe policies help to further legitimate prison objectives. Unless there\nis more, the Secretary\u2019s supporting material brings the Policy within\nTurner\u2019s scope. Pp. 6\u201310.\n   (c) Although summary judgment rules gave Banks an opportunity\nto respond to these materials, he did not do so in the manner the\nrules provide. Instead, he filed a cross-motion for summary judg\nment, arguing that the Policy fell of its own weight. Neither the\ncases he cites nor the statistics he notes support his argument. In\nreaching a contrary conclusion, the Third Circuit placed too high an\nevidentiary burden on the Secretary and offered too little deference to\nthe prison officials\u2019 judgment. Such deference does not make it im\npossible for those attacking prison policies to succeed. A prisoner\nmay be able to marshal substantial evidence, for example through\ndepositions, that a policy is not reasonable or that there is a genuine\nissue of material fact for trial. And, as Overton noted, if faced with a\nde facto permanent ban involving a severe restriction, this Court\nmight reach a different conclusion. Pp. 10\u201313.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, concluded that, using\nthe framework set forth in JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019 concurrence in Overton v.\nBazzetta, 539 U. S. 126, 138, Pennsylvania\u2019s prison regulations are\npermissible. That framework provides the least perilous approach for\nresolving challenges to prison regulations and is the approach most\nfaithful to the Constitution. \u201cSentencing a criminal to a term of im\nprisonment may . . . carry with it the implied delegation to prison of\nficials to discipline and otherwise supervise the criminal while he is\nincarcerated.\u201d Id., at 140, n. A term of imprisonment in Pennsyl\nvania includes such an implied delegation. Inmates are subject to\nDepartment of Corrections rules and disciplinary rulings, and the\nchallenged regulations fall with the Department\u2019s discretion. This\nconclusion is supported by the plurality\u2019s Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S.\n78, analysis. The \u201chistory of incarceration as punishment [also] sup\nports the view that the sentenc[e] . . . terminated\u201d respondent\u2019s unfet\n4                            BEARD v.

The\ncase arises on a motion for summary judgment. While we\ndo not deny the constitutional importance of the interests\nin question, we find, on the basis of the record now before\nus, that prison officials have set forth adequate legal\nsupport for the policy.

S. 126, 132 (2003) (need for \u201csubstantial deference to\nthe professional judgment of prison administrators\u201d).\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   The prison regulation at issue applies to certain prison\ners housed in Pennsylvania\u2019s Long Term Segregation Unit.\nThe LTSU is the most restrictive of the three special units\nthat Pennsylvania maintains for difficult prisoners. The\nfirst such unit, the \u201cRestricted Housing Unit,\u201d is designed\nfor prisoners who are under disciplinary sanction or who\nare assigned to administrative segregation. App. 80. The\nsecond such unit, the \u201cSpecial Management Unit,\u201d is\nintended for prisoners who \u201cexhibit behavior that is con\ntinually disruptive, violent, dangerous or a threat to the\norderly operation of their assigned facility.\u201d Ibid. The\nthird such unit, the LTSU, is reserved for the Common\nwealth\u2019s \u201cmost incorrigible, recalcitrant inmates.\u201d Id., at\n25.\n   LTSU inmates number about 40. Id., at 127. Most, but\nnot all, have \u201cflunked out\u201d of the SMU program. Id., at\n137. To qualify, they must have met one or more of the\nfollowing conditions: failure to \u201ccomplete\u201d the SMU pro\ngram; \u201cassaultive behavior with the intent to cause death\nor serious bodily injury\u201d; causing injury to other inmates\nor staff; \u201cengaging in facility disturbance(s)\u201d; belonging to\nan unauthorized organization or \u201cSecurity Threat Group\u201d;\nengaging in criminal activity that \u201cthreatens the commu\nnity\u201d; possessing while in prison \u201cweapons\u201d or \u201cimple\nments of escape\u201d; or having a history of \u201cserious\u201d escape\nattempts, \u201cexerting negative influence in facility activi\nties,\u201d or being a \u201csexual predator.\u201d Id., at 85\u201386. The\nLTSU is divided into two levels. All inmates are initially\nassigned to the most restrictive level, level 2. After 90\ndays, depending upon an inmate\u2019s behavior, an individual\nmay graduate to the less restrictive level 1, although in\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            3\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\npractice most do not. Id., at 131\u2013132, 138.\n  The RHU, SMU, and LTSU all seriously restrict in\nmates\u2019 ordinary prison privileges. At all three units,\nresidents are typically confined to cells for 23 hours a day,\nhave limited access to the commissary or outside visitors,\nand (with the exception of some phases of the SMU) may\nnot watch television or listen to the radio. Id., at 102;\nBrief for Petitioner 2\u20134.\n  Prisoners at level 2 of the LTSU face the most severe\nform of the restrictions listed above. They have no access\nto the commissary, they may have only one visitor per\nmonth (an immediate family member), and they are not\nallowed phone calls except in emergencies. App. 102. In\naddition they (unlike all other prisoners in the Common\nwealth) are restricted in the manner at issue here: They\nhave no access to newspapers, magazines, or personal\nphotographs. Id., at 26. They are nonetheless permitted\nlegal and personal correspondence, religious and legal\nmaterials, two library books, and writing paper. Id., at 35,\n102, 169. If an inmate progresses to level 1, he enjoys\nsomewhat less severe restrictions, including the right to\nreceive one newspaper and five magazines. Id., at 26, 102.\nThe ban on photographs is not lifted unless a prisoner\nprogresses out of the LTSU altogether. Ibid.\n                             B\n  In 2001, plaintiff Ronald Banks, respondent here, then a\nprisoner confined to LTSU level 2, filed this federal-court\naction against Jeffrey Beard, the Secretary of the Penn\nsylvania Department of Corrections. See Rev. Stat. \u00a71979,\n42 U. S. C. \u00a71983. Banks claimed that the level 2 Policy\nforbidding inmates all access to newspapers, magazines,\nand photographs bears no reasonable relation to any\nlegitimate penological objective and consequently violates\nthe First Amendment. App. 15; see also Turner, supra;\nOverton, supra. The Secretary, the defendant, petitioner\n4                    BEARD v. BANKS\n\n                    Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nhere, filed an answer. The District Court certified a class\ncomposed of similar level 2 inmates, and the court as\nsigned the case to a Magistrate who conducted discovery.\n   Banks\u2019 counsel deposed a deputy superintendent at the\nprison, Joel Dickson. The parties introduced various\nprison policy manuals and related documents into the\nrecord. And at that point the Secretary filed a motion for\nsummary judgment. He also filed a \u201cStatement of Mate\nrial Facts Not in Dispute,\u201d with a copy of the deputy su\nperintendent\u2019s deposition attached as an appendix. See\nApp. 25; Rule 56.1(C)(1) (WD Pa. 2006).\n   Banks (who was represented by counsel throughout)\nfiled no opposition to the Secretary\u2019s motion, but instead\nfiled a cross-motion for summary judgment. Neither that\ncross-motion nor any other of Banks\u2019 filings sought to\nplace any significant fact in dispute, and Banks has never\nsought a trial to determine the validity of the Policy.\nRather, Banks claimed in his cross-motion that the undis\nputed facts, including those in Dickson\u2019s deposition, enti\ntled him to summary judgment. In this way, and by fail\ning specifically to challenge the facts identified in the\ndefendant\u2019s statement of undisputed facts, Banks is\ndeemed to have admitted the validity of the facts con\ntained in the Secretary\u2019s statement. See Rule 56.1(E).\n   On the basis of the record as described (the complaint,\nthe answer, the statement of undisputed facts, other\nagreed-upon descriptions of the system, the Dickson depo\nsition, and the motions for summary judgment), the Mag\nistrate recommended that the District Court grant the\nSecretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment and deny that\nof Banks.

The Secretary sought our review of the\nAppeals Court\u2019s judgment, and we granted his petition.\n546 U. S. ___ (2005).\n                               II\n     Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78 (1987), and Overton v.\nBazzetta, 539 U. S 126 (2003), contain the basic substan\ntive legal standards governing this case. This Court rec\nognized in Turner that imprisonment does not automati\ncally deprive a prisoner of certain important constitutional\nprotections, including those of the First Amendment. Id.,\nat 93; see also O\u2019Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U. S. 342,\n348 (1987). But at the same time the Constitution some\ntimes permits greater restriction of such rights in a prison\nthan it would allow elsewhere. See, e.g., Turner, supra, at\n84\u201385. As Overton (summarizing pre-Turner case law)\npointed out, courts owe \u201csubstantial deference to the\nprofessional judgment of prison administrators.\u201d 539\nU. S., at 132. And Turner reconciled these principles by\nholding that restrictive prison regulations are permissible\nif they are \u201c\u2018reasonably related\u2019 to legitimate penological\ninterests,\u201d 482 U. S., at 87, and are not an \u201cexaggerated\nresponse\u201d to such objectives, ibid.\n    Turner also sets forth four factors \u201crelevant in determin\ning the reasonableness of the regulation at issue.\u201d Id., at\n89. First, is there a \u201c \u2018valid, rational connection\u2019 between\nthe prison regulation and the legitimate governmental\ninterest put forward to justify it\u201d? Ibid. Second, are there\n\u201calternative means of exercising the right that remain\nopen to prison inmates\u201d? Id., at 90. Third, what \u201cimpact\u201d\nwill \u201caccommodation of the asserted constitutional right\n. . . have on guards and other inmates, and on the alloca\ntion of prison resources generally\u201d? Ibid. And, fourth, are\n\u201cready alternatives\u201d for furthering the governmental\n6                      BEARD v. BANKS\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ninterest available? Ibid.\n   This case has arrived in this Court in the context of the\nSecretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Thus we must\nexamine the record to see whether the Secretary, in depo\nsitions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, affidavits\nand the like, has demonstrated \u201cthe absence of a genuine\nissue of material fact\u201d and his entitlement to judgment as\na matter of law. See, e.g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56; Celotex\nCorp. v. Catrett, 477 U. S. 317 (1986).\n   If the Secretary has done so, then we must determine\nwhether Banks, the plaintiff, who bears the burden of per\nsuasion, Overton, supra, at 132, has \u201cby affidavits or as\notherwise provided\u201d in Rule 56 (e.g. through depositions,\netc.) \u201cset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine\nissue for trial.\u201d Rule 56(e) (emphasis added). If not, the\nlaw requires entry of judgment in the Secretary\u2019s favor. See\nCelotex Corp., supra, at 322 (Rule 56 \u201cmandates the entry\nof summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery\nand upon motion, against a party who fails to make a\nshowing sufficient to establish the existence of an element\nessential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will\nbear the burden of proof at trial\u201d).\n   We recognize that at this stage we must draw \u201call justifi\nable inferences\u201d in Banks\u2019 \u201cfavor.\u201d Anderson v. Liberty\nLobby, Inc., 477 U. S. 242, 255 (1986). In doing so, however,\nwe must distinguish between evidence of disputed facts and\ndisputed matters of professional judgment. In respect to the\nlatter, our inferences must accord deference to the views of\nprison authorities. Overton, supra. Unless a prisoner can\npoint to sufficient evidence regarding such issues of judg\nment to allow him to prevail on the merits, he cannot pre\nvail at the summary judgment stage.\n                            III\n    The Secretary in his motion set forth several justifica\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ntions for the prison\u2019s policy, including the need to motivate\nbetter behavior on the part of particularly difficult prison\ners, the need to minimize the amount of property they\ncontrol in their cells, and the need to assure prison safety,\nby, for example, diminishing the amount of material a\nprisoner might use to start a cell fire. We need go no\nfurther than the first justification, that of providing in\ncreased incentives for better prison behavior. Applying\nthe well-established substantive and procedural standards\nset forth in Part II, we find, on the basis of the record\nbefore us, that the Secretary\u2019s justification is adequate.\nAnd that finding here warrants summary judgment in the\nSecretary\u2019s favor.\n                               A\n   The Secretary rested his motion for summary judgment\nprimarily upon the statement of undisputed facts along\nwith Deputy Prison Superintendent Dickson\u2019s affidavit.\nThe statement of undisputed facts says that the LTSU\u2019s\n40 inmates, about 0.01 percent of the total prison popula\ntion, constitute the \u201c \u2018worst of the worst,\u2019 \u201d those who \u201chave\nproven by the history of their behavior in prison, the\nnecessity of holding them in the rigorous regime of con\nfinement\u201d of the LTSU. App. 26. It then sets forth three\n\u201cpenological rationales\u201d for the Policy, summarized from\nthe Dickson deposition:\n     (1) to \u201cmotivat[e]\u201d better \u201cbehavior\u201d on the part of\n    these \u201cparticularly difficult prisoners,\u201d by providing\n    them with an incentive to move to level 1, or out of the\n    LTSU altogether, and to \u201cdiscourage backsliding\u201d on\n    the part of level 1 inmates;\n     (2) to minimize the amount of property controlled by\n    the prisoners, on the theory that the \u201cless property\n    these high maintenance, high supervision, obdurate\n    troublemakers have, the easier it is for . . . correc\n    tional officer[s] to detect concealed contraband [and]\n8                     BEARD v. BANKS\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n    to provide security\u201d; and\n    (3) to diminish the amount of material (in particular\n    newspapers and magazines) that prisoners might use\n    as weapons of attack in the form of \u201c \u2018spears\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018blow\n    guns,\u2019 \u201d or that they could employ \u201cas tools to catapult\n    feces at the guards without the necessity of soiling\n    one\u2019s own hands,\u201d or use \u201cas tinder for cell fires.\u201d Id.,\n    at 27.\n   As we have said we believe that the first rationale itself\nsatisfies Turner\u2019s requirements. First, the statement and\ndeposition set forth a \u201c \u2018valid, rational connection\u2019 \u201d be\ntween the Policy and \u201c \u2018legitimate penological objectives.\u2019 \u201d\n482 U. S., at 89, 95. The deputy superintendent stated in\nhis deposition that prison authorities are \u201cvery limited . . .\nin what we can and cannot deny or give to [a level 2]\ninmate [who typically has already been deprived of almost\nall privileges, see supra, at 2\u20133], and these are some of the\nitems that we feel are legitimate as incentives for inmate\ngrowth.\u201d App. 190. The statement of undisputed facts\n(relying on the deposition) added that the Policy \u201cserves to\nencourage . . . progress and discourage backsliding by the\nlevel 1 inmates.\u201d Id., at 27.\n   These statements point to evidence\u2014namely, the views\nof the deputy superintendent\u2014that the regulations do, in\nfact, serve the function identified. The articulated connec\ntions between newspapers and magazines, the deprivation\nof virtually the last privilege left to an inmate, and\na significant incentive to improve behavior, are\nlogical ones. Thus, the first factor supports the Policy\u2019s\n\u201creasonableness.\u201d\n   As to the second factor, the statement and deposition\nmake clear that, as long as the inmate remains at level 2,\nno \u201calternative means of exercising the right\u201d remain open\nto him. Turner, supra, at 90. After 90 days the prisoner\nmay be able to graduate to level 1 and thus regain his\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            9\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\naccess to most of the lost rights. In the approximately 2 \u00bd\nyears after the LTSU opened, about 25 percent of those\nconfined to level 2 did graduate to level 1 or out of the\nLTSU altogether. App. 138; Reply Brief for Petitioner 8.\nBut these circumstances simply limit, they do not elimi\nnate, the fact that there is no alternative. The absence of\nany alternative thus provides \u201csome evidence that the\nregulations [a]re unreasonable,\u201d but is not \u201cconclusive\u201d of\nthe reasonableness of the Policy. Overton, 539 U. S., at\n135.\n   As to the third factor, the statement and deposition\nindicate that, were prison authorities to seek to \u201caccom\nmodat[e] . . . the asserted constitutional right,\u201d the result\ning \u201cimpact\u201d would be negative. That circumstance is also\ninherent in the nature of the Policy: If the Policy (in the\nauthorities\u2019 view) helps to produce better behavior, then\nits absence (in the authorities\u2019 view) will help to produce\nworse behavior, e.g., \u201cbacksliding\u201d (and thus the expendi\nture of more \u201cresources\u201d at level 2). Turner, 482 U. S., at\n90. Similarly, as to the fourth factor, neither the state\nment nor the deposition describes, points to, or calls to\nmind any \u201calternative method of accommodating the\nclaimant\u2019s constitutional complaint . . . that fully accom\nmodates the prisoner\u2019s rights at de minimis cost to valid\npenological interests.\u201d Id., at 90\u201391.\n   In fact, the second, third, and fourth factors, being in a\nsense logically related to the Policy itself, here add little,\none way or another, to the first factor\u2019s basic logical ra\ntionale. See post, at 6 (opinion of STEVENS, J.) (noting that\n\u201cdeprivation theory does not map easily onto several of the\nTurner factors\u201d), cf. post, at 5-6 (opinion of THOMAS, J.)\n(similar). The fact that two of these latter three factors\nseem to support the Policy does not, therefore, count in the\nSecretary\u2019s favor. The real task in this case is not balanc\ning these factors, but rather determining whether the\nSecretary shows more than simply a logical relation, that\n10                    BEARD v. BANKS\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nis, whether he shows a reasonable relation. We believe the\nmaterial presented here by the prison officials is sufficient\nto demonstrate that the Policy is a reasonable one.\n   Overton provides significant support for this conclusion.\nIn Overton we upheld a prison\u2019s \u201csevere\u201d restriction on the\nfamily visitation privileges of prisoners with repeat sub\nstance abuse violations. 539 U. S., at 134. Despite the\nimportance of the rights there at issue, we held that with\nholding such privileges \u201cis a proper and even necessary\nmanagement technique to induce compliance with the\nrules of inmate behavior, especially for high-security\nprisoners who have few other privileges to lose.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Policy and circumstances here are not identical, but\nwe have not found differences that are significant. In both\ncases, the deprivations at issue (all visits with close family\nmembers; all access to newspapers, magazines, and pho\ntos) have an important constitutional dimension. In both\ncases, prison officials have imposed the deprivation at\nissue only upon those with serious prison-behavior prob\nlems (here the 40 most intractable inmates in the Com\nmonwealth). In both cases, prison officials, relying on\ntheir professional judgment, reached an experience-based\nconclusion that the policies help to further legitimate\nprison objectives.\n   The upshot is that, if we consider the Secretary\u2019s sup\nporting materials, i.e., the statement and deposition), by\nthemselves, they provide sufficient justification for the\nPolicy. That is to say, unless there is more, they bring the\nPolicy within Turner\u2019s legitimating scope.\n                            B\n  Although summary judgment rules provided Banks with\nan opportunity to respond to the Secretary\u2019s materials, he\ndid not offer any fact-based or expert-based refutation in\nthe manner the rules provide.

And he adds\nthat only about one-quarter of level 2 inmates graduate\nout of that environment.\n   The cases to which Banks refers, however, simply point\nout that, in the view of some courts, increased contact with\nthe world generally favors rehabilitation. See Abdul Wali,\nsupra, at 1034; Bieregu, supra, at 1449; Knecht, supra, at\n1200. That circumstance, as written about in court opin\nions, cannot provide sufficient support, particularly as\nthese courts were not considering contexts such as this\none, where prison officials are dealing with especially\ndifficult prisoners. Neither can Banks find the necessary\nassistance in the fact that only one-quarter or so of the\nlevel 2 population graduates to level 1 or out of the LTSU.\nGiven the incorrigibility of level 2 inmates\u2014which peti\ntioner himself admits\u2014there is nothing to indicate that a\n25 percent graduation rate is low, rather than, as the\nSecretary suggests, acceptably high.\n12                    BEARD v. BANKS\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n   We recognize that the Court of Appeals reached a con\ntrary conclusion. But in doing so, it placed too high an\nevidentiary burden upon the Secretary. In respect to\nbehavior-modification incentives, for example, the court\nwrote that the \u201cDistrict Court did not examine . . .\nwhether the ban was implemented in a way that could\nmodify behavior, or inquire into whether the [Department\nof Corrections\u2019] deprivation theory of behavior modifica\ntion had any basis in real human psychology, or had\nproven effective with LTSU inmates.\u201d 399 F. 3d, at 142.\nAnd, the court phrased the relevant conclusions in terms\nthat placed a high summary judgment evidentiary burden\nupon the Secretary, i.e., the moving party. See, e.g., id., at\n141 (\u201c[W]e cannot say that the [defendant] has shown how\nthe regulations in this case serve [an incentive-related]\npurpose\u201d). The court\u2019s statements and conclusions here\nalso offer too little deference to the judgment of prison\nofficials about such matters. The court, for example,\noffered no apparent deference to the deputy prison super\nintendent\u2019s professional judgment that the Policy deprived\n\u201cparticularly difficult\u201d inmates of a last remaining privi\nlege and that doing so created a significant behavioral\nincentive.\n   Contrary to JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s suggestion, post, at 2\u2013\n4, we do not suggest that the deference owed prison au\nthorities makes it impossible for prisoners or others at\ntacking a prison policy like the present one ever to succeed\nor to survive summary judgment. After all, the constitu\ntional interest here is an important one. Turner requires\nprison authorities to show more than a formalistic logical\nconnection between a regulation and a penological objec\ntive. A prisoner may be able to marshal substantial evi\ndence that, given the importance of the interest, the Policy\nis not a reasonable one. Cf. 482 U. S., at 97\u201399 (striking\ndown prison policy prohibiting prisoner marriages). And\nwith or without the assistance that public interest law\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

Finally, as in Overton, we agree that \u201cthe\nrestriction here is severe,\u201d and \u201cif faced with evidence that\n[it were] a de facto permanent ban . . . we might well reach\na different conclusion in a challenge to a particular appli\ncation of the regulation.\u201d 539 U. S., at 134. That is not,\nhowever, the case before us.\n   Here prison authorities responded adequately through\ntheir statement and deposition to the allegations in the\ncomplaint. And the plaintiff failed to point to \u201c \u2018specific\nfacts\u2019 \u201d in the record that could \u201clead a rational trier of fact\nto find\u201d in his favor. Matsushita Elec.

Just last Term, this Court invalidated\nCalifornia\u2019s policy of racially segregating prisoners in its\nreception centers, notwithstanding that State\u2019s warning\nthat its policy was necessary to prevent prison violence.\nSee Johnson v. California, 543 U. S. 499 (2005). California\nsubsequently experienced several instances of severe race-\nbased prison violence, including a riot that resulted in 2\nfatalities and more than 100 injuries, and significant fight\ning along racial lines between newly arrived inmates, the\nvery inmates that were subject to the policy invalidated by\nthe Court in Johnson. See Winton & Bernstein, More Vio\nlence Erupts at Pitchess; Black and Latino inmates clash at\nthe north county jail, leaving 13 injured, Los Angeles Times,\nMar. 1, 2006, Metro Desk, p. B1. This powerful reminder of\nthe grave dangers inherent in prison administration con\nfirms my view that the framework I set forth in Overton v.\nBazzetta, 539 U. S. 126, 138 (2003) (opinion concurring in\njudgment), is the least perilous approach for resolving chal\nlenges to prison regulations, as well as the approach that is\nmost faithful to the Constitution. Accordingly, I concur only\n2                         BEARD v. BANKS\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nin the judgment of the Court.\n                               I\n   Both the plurality and the dissent evaluate the regula\ntions challenged in this case pursuant to the approach set\nforth in Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78 (1987), which permits\nprison regulations that \u201cimping[e] on inmates\u2019 constitu\ntional rights\u201d if the regulations are \u201creasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests.\u201d Id., at 89. But as I\nexplained in Overton, Turner and its progeny \u201crest on the\nunstated (and erroneous) presumption that the Constitu\ntion contains an implicit definition of incarceration.\u201d\nOverton, 539 U. S., at 139 (opinion concurring in judg\nment). Because the Constitution contains no such defini\ntion, \u201cStates are free to define and redefine all types of\npunishment, including imprisonment, to encompass vari\nous types of deprivations\u2014provided only that those depri\nvations are consistent with the Eighth Amendment.\u201d Ibid.\n(emphasis in original). Respondent has not challenged\nPennsylvania\u2019s prison policy as a violation of the Eighth\nAmendment, and thus the sole inquiry in this case is\nwhether respondent\u2019s sentence deprived him of the rights\nhe now seeks to exercise. Id., at 140.\n   \u201cWhether a sentence encompasses the extinction of a\nconstitutional right enjoyed by free persons turns on state\nlaw, for it is a State\u2019s prerogative to determine how it will\npunish violations of its law.\u201d Ibid.1 Although the question\nof whether Pennsylvania intended to confer upon respon\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 As in Overton, respondent has not asked this Court to abstain from\n\nresolving his constitutional challenge under Railroad Comm\u2019n of Tex. v.\nPullman Co., 312 U. S. 496 (1941) (holding that federal courts should\nordinarily abstain where the resolution of a federal constitutional issue\nmay be rendered irrelevant by the determination of a predicate state-law\nquestion), and the issue of Pullman abstention was not considered below.\nAs a result, respondent has \u201csubmitted to the sort of guesswork about the\nmeaning of prison sentences that is the hallmark of the Turner inquiry.\u201d\nOverton, 539 U. S., at 141 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           3\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndent and other inmates a right to have unfettered access\nto newspapers, magazines, and photographs is thus \u201culti\nmately for the State itself to answer,\u201d in the absence of a\nresolution of that question by the Pennsylvania Supreme\nCourt, we must resolve it in the instant case. Id., at 141.\nFortunately, the answer is straightforward.\n  In Overton, I explained:\n    \u201c[s]entencing a criminal to a term of imprisonment\n    may, under state law, carry with it the implied dele\n    gation to prison officials to discipline and otherwise\n    supervise the criminal while he is incarcerated. Thus,\n    restrictions imposed by prison officials may also be a\n    part of the sentence, provided that those officials are\n    not acting ultra vires with respect to the discretion\n    given them, by implication, in the sentence.\u201d Id., at\n    140, n. *\nA term of imprisonment in Pennsylvania includes such\nan implied delegation. Pennsylvania inmates are subject\nto the rules and disciplinary measures set forth by\nthe Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. See, e.g.,\nBulletin Inmate Discipline, Policy No. DC\u2013ADM 801\n(2004), http://www.cor.state.pa.us/standards/lib/standards/\nDC-ADM_801_Inmate_Discipline.pdf (as visited June 12,\n2006, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). And no\none disputes that the regulations challenged in the instant\nlitigation fall within the discretion given to the Depart\nment of Corrections. As in Overton, the conclusion that\nthese regulations are included in the prison sentence is\nstrongly supported by the plurality\u2019s Turner analysis.

S., at 141\u2013142\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\n   The \u201chistory of incarceration as punishment [also] sup\nports the view that the sentenc[e] imposed on responden[t]\nterminated\u201d his unfettered right to magazines, newspa\npers, and photographs. Id., at 142. As I explained in\nOverton, imprisonment as punishment \u201cbecame standard\nized in the period between 1780 and 1865,\u201d id., at 143\n(citing McGowen, The Well-Ordered Prison: England,\n1780\u20131865, in The Oxford History of the Prison: The\nPractice of Punishment in Western Society 79 (N. Morris\n& D. Rothman eds. 1995)), and was distinguished by the\nprisoner\u2019s isolation from the outside world. 539 U. S., at\n143. Indeed, both the Pennsylvania and Auburn prison\nmodels, which formed the basis for prison systems\nthroughout the Nation in the early 1800\u2019s, imposed this\nisolation specifically by denying prisoners access to read\ning materials and contact with their families. Rothman,\nPerfecting the Prison: United States, 1789\u20131865, in The\nOxford History of the Prison 117; see also id., at 118 (ex\nplaining that in the Pennsylvania system, inmates were\n\u201cgiven nothing to read except the Bible and were pre\nvented from corresponding with friends and family\u201d); S.\nChristianson, With Liberty for Some: 500 Years of Impris\nonment in America 145 (1998) (explaining that in Sing\nSing, the standard bearer for the Auburn model, no read\ning materials of any kind, except the Bible, were allowed\ninside). Even as the advent of prison libraries increased\nprisoners\u2019 access to reading materials, that access was\nuniversally \u201csubject to some form of censorship,\u201d such that\n\u201cinmates of correctional institutions are denied access to\nbooks which are freely available to the rest of the commu\nnity.\u201d G.

Overton,\nsupra, at 144\u2013145 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\nAccordingly, respondent\u2019s challenge to Pennsylvania\u2019s\nprison regulations must fail.\n                              II\n   This case reveals the shortcomings of the Turner frame\nwork, at least insofar as that framework is applied to\nprison regulations that seek to modify inmate behavior\nthrough privilege deprivation.      In applying the first\nTurner factor, the plurality correctly observes that Penn\nsylvania\u2019s policy of depriving its most incorrigible inmates\nof their last few remaining privileges bears a \u201cvalid ra\ntional connection\u201d to the \u201clegitimate penological objec\ntiv[e]\u201d of \u201cencourag[ing] progress and discourag[ing] back\nsliding\u201d of inmate compliance with prison rules. Ante, at\n8, 9 (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, this\nCourt has previously determined that \u201c[w]ithdrawing . . .\nprivileges is a proper and even necessary management\ntechnique to induce compliance with the rules of inmate\nbehavior, especially for high-security prisoners.\u201d Overton,\nsupra, at 134.2\n   Although policies, such as Pennsylvania\u2019s, that seek to\npromote compliance with prison rules by withdrawing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 In my view, this legal conclusion, combined with the deference to\nthe judgment of prison officials required under Turner, see ante, at 8\u2013\n15, would entitle prison officials to summary judgment against chal\nlenges to their inmate prison deprivation policies in virtually every\ncase. In this context, it is highly unlikely a prisoner could establish\nthat the \u201cconnection between the regulation and the asserted goal is\narbitrary or irrational.\u201d Shaw v. Murphy, 532 U. S. 223, 229 (2001)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n6                      BEARD v. BANKS\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nvarious privileges may always satisfy Turner\u2019s first factor,\nthey necessarily fail its second factor. Such policies, by\ndesign, do not provide an \u201calternative means\u201d for inmates\nto exercise the rights they have been deprived. 482 U. S.,\nat 90. The \u201clegitimate penological objectiv[e]\u201d of encourag\ning compliance with prison rules by depriving misbehav\ning inmates of various privileges simply cannot be accom\nplished if prison officials are required to provide prisoners\nwith an alternative and equivalent set of privileges. Thus,\nthe plurality\u2019s observation that respondent\u2019s privileges\nmay be restored in response to continued, improved behav\nior, is simply irrelevant to the second factor of Turner,\nwhich asks only \u201cwhether . . . alternative means of exercis\ning the right . . . remain open to prison inmates.\u201d Ibid.\nThe answer in the context of privilege deprivation policies\nis always no, thus demonstrating the difficulty of analyz\ning such policies under the Turner framework.\n   The third and fourth Turner factors are likewise poorly\nsuited to determining the validity of inmate privilege\ndeprivation policies. When the \u201cvalid penological objec\ntiv[e]\u201d of a prison policy is encouraging compliance with\nprison rules, it makes little sense to inquire into \u201cthe\nimpact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right\nwill have on guards and other inmates, and on the alloca\ntion of prison resources generally,\u201d or into the availability\nof \u201cready alternatives.\u201d Ibid. At best, such inquiries\nmerely collapse the third and fourth factors into the first,\nbecause accommodating the exercise of the deprived right\nwill undermine the incentive effects of the prison policy\nand because the unavailability of \u201cready alternatives\u201d is\ntypically (as in this case) one of the underlying rationales\nfor the adoption of inmate privilege deprivation policies.\n                       *     *   *\n  Because the prison regulations at issue today are per\nmissible under the approach I explained in Overton, I\nconcur in the judgment of the Court.\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

See, e.g., O\u2019Lone\nv. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U. S. 342, 348 (1987). When a\nprison regulation impinges upon First Amendment free\ndoms, it is invalid unless \u201cit is reasonably related to legiti\nmate penological interests.\u201d Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78,\n89 (1987). Under this standard, a prison regulation cannot\nwithstand constitutional scrutiny if \u201cthe logical connection\nbetween the regulation and the asserted goal is so remote as\nto render the policy arbitrary or irrational,\u201d id., at 89\u201390, or\nif the regulation represents an \u201cexaggerated response\u201d to\nlegitimate penological objectives, id., at 98.\n   In this case, Pennsylvania prison officials have promul\ngated a rule that prohibits inmates in Long Term Segrega\ntion Unit, level 2 (LTSU\u20132), which is the most restrictive\ncondition of confinement statewide, from possessing any\n2                     BEARD v.

In addition,\nunder the challenged rule, any personal photograph, includ\ning those of spouses, children, deceased parents, or inspira\ntional mentors, will be treated as contraband and confis\ncated. See App. 176.\n   It is indisputable that this prohibition on the possession\nof newspapers and photographs infringes upon respon\ndent\u2019s First Amendment rights. \u201c[T]he State may not,\nconsistently with the spirit of the First Amendment, con\ntract the spectrum of available knowledge.

Plainly, the rule at issue in this case strikes at the\ncore of the First Amendment rights to receive, to read, and\nto think.\n   Petitioner does not dispute that the prohibition at issue\ninfringes upon rights protected by the First Amendment.\nInstead, petitioner posits two penological interests, which,\nin his view, are sufficient to justify the challenged rule\nnotwithstanding these constitutional infringements:\nprison security and inmate rehabilitation. Although these\ninterests are certainly valid, petitioner has failed to estab\nlish, as a matter of law, that the challenged rule is rea\nsonably related to these interests. Accordingly, the Court\nof Appeals properly denied petitioner\u2019s motion for sum\nmary judgment, and this Court errs by intervening to\nprevent a trial.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

Many of these\n    items are flammable, could be used [to start fires,\n    catapult feces, or to create other dangers] as effec\n    tively as a newspaper, magazine or photograph, and\n    have been so used by [LTSU\u20132] inmates.\u201d 399 F. 3d\n    134, 143 (2005) (case below).\n  In fact, the amount of potentially dangerous material to\nwhich LTSU-2 inmates are seeking access is quite small in\ncomparison to the amount of material that they already\npossess in their cells. As the Court of Appeals empha\nsized, LTSU-2 inmates \u201care not requesting unlimited\naccess to innumerable periodicals,\u201d rather, they are seek\ning \u201cthe ability to have one newspaper or magazine and\nsome small number of photographs in their cells at one\ntime.\u201d 399 F. 3d, at 144 (emphasis added). In light of the\nquantity of materials that LTSU\u20132 inmates are entitled to\nhave in their cell, it does not follow, as a matter of logic,\nthat preventing inmates from possessing a single copy of a\nsecular, nonlegal newspaper, newsletter, or magazine will\nhave any measurable effect on the likelihood that inmates\nwill start fires, hide contraband, or engage in other dan\n4                        BEARD v.

Wouldn\u2019t it be fair to say that if an inmate wants\n     to start a fire, he could start a fire using writing paper\n     in combination with a blanket or in combination with\n     clothing or linen, bedding materials? He could do\n     that; couldn\u2019t he?\n     \u201cA. Yes.\n     \u201cQ. If he wants to throw feces, he could use a cup for\n     that; true?\n     \u201cA. Yes.\n     \u201cQ. Or if he wants to throw urine, he can use his cup\n     to throw the urine?\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Even less apparent is the security risk that would be posed by re\n\nspondent\u2019s alternative suggestion, which is that LTSU-2 inmates be\nable to access news periodicals in the LTSU mini-law library, where\ninmates are already permitted to go to view legal materials during 2\nhour blocs of time pursuant to a first-come, first-serve roster of re\nquests.

Yes.\u201d App. 196\u2013197.2\n   The security-based justification for the ban on personal\nphotographs is even weaker. There is not a single state\nment in Superintendent Dickson\u2019s deposition suggesting\nthat prisoners have used, or would be likely to use, photo\ngraphic paper to start fires or hurl excrement. Cf. id., at\n196 (stating that paper products are generally used to\nstart fires).\n   Perhaps, at trial, petitioner could introduce additional\nevidence supporting his view that the challenged regula\ntion is in fact reasonably likely to enhance security or that\nrespondent\u2019s request for limited access to newspapers and\nphotographs would, for some as yet undisclosed reason,\nrequire an unduly burdensome expenditure of resources\non the part of prison officials. However, the above discus\nsion makes clear that, at the very least, \u201creasonable minds\ncould differ as to the import of the evidence\u201d introduced\nthus far concerning the relationship between the chal\nlenged regulation and petitioner\u2019s posited security inter\nest, Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S. 242, 250\n(1986). Accordingly, petitioner\u2019s valid interest in security\nis not sufficient to warrant judgment as a matter of law.\nSee id., at 250\u2013251.\n   The second rationale posited by petitioner in support of\nthe prohibitions on newspapers, newsletters, magazines,\nand photographs is rehabilitation. According to petitioner,\nthe ban \u201cprovides the [l]evel 2 inmates with the prospect of\nearning a privilege through compliance with orders and\nremission of various negative behaviors and serves to\nencourage the progress and discourage backsliding by the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 See also App. 194 (\u201cI would say there\u2019s any number of ways [LTSU\u2013\n\n2 inmates hurl feces]. Oftentimes it\u2019s with the cups that they\u2019re given\nfor their drinks, things like that, any type of container; or . . . a piece of\npaper or whatever wrapped up that they can use to give a little lever\nage and fling the materials.\u201d).\n6                      BEARD v. BANKS\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nlevel 1 inmates.\u201d App. 27. In the plurality\u2019s view, in light\nof the present record, this rationale is sufficient to warrant\na reversal of the judgment below.\n   Rehabilitation is undoubtedly a legitimate penological\ninterest. However, the particular theory of rehabilitation\nat issue in this case presents a special set of concerns for\ncourts considering whether a prison regulation is consis\ntent with the First Amendment. Specifically, petitioner\nadvances a deprivation theory of rehabilitation: Any dep\nrivation of something a prisoner desires gives him an\nadded incentive to improve his behavior. This justification\nhas no limiting principle; if sufficient, it would provide a\n\u201crational basis\u201d for any regulation that deprives a prisoner\nof a constitutional right so long as there is at least a theo\nretical possibility that the prisoner can regain the right at\nsome future time by modifying his behavior. See Kimber\nlin v. United States Dept. of Justice, 318 F. 3d 228, 240\n(CADC 2003) (per curiam) (Tatel, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part) (noting that \u201cregulations that\ndeprive prisoners of their constitutional rights will always\nbe rationally related to the goal of making prison more\nmiserable\u201d). Indeed, the more important the constitu\ntional right at stake (at least from the prisoners\u2019 perspec\ntive), the stronger the justification for depriving prisoners\nof that right. The plurality admits as much: \u201cIf the policy\n(in the authorities\u2019 view) helps to produce better behavior,\nthen its absence (in the authorities\u2019 view) will help to\nproduce worse behavior. . . .\u201d Ante, at 9.\n   Not surprisingly, as JUSTICE THOMAS recognizes, see\nante, at 5-6, this deprivation theory does not map easily\nonto several of the Turner factors, which are premised on\nprison officials presenting a secondary effects type ration\nale in support of a challenged regulation. For instance,\nunder the deprivation theory of rehabilitation, there could\nnever be a \u201cready alternative\u201d for furthering the govern\nment interest, because the government interest is tied\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ndirectly to depriving the prisoner of the constitutional\nright at issue.\n   Indeed, the strong form of the deprivation theory of\nrehabilitation would mean that the prison rule we invali\ndated in Turner would have survived constitutional scru\ntiny if the State had simply posited an interest in rehabili\ntating prisoners through deprivation. In Turner, we held\nthat a Missouri regulation that forbade inmates from\nmarrying except with the permission of the prison super\nintendent was facially unconstitutional. See 482 U. S., at\n97\u201399. We rejected the State\u2019s proffered security and\nrehabilitation concerns as not reasonably related to the\nmarriage ban. See ibid. Taken to its logical conclusion,\nhowever, the deprivation theory of rehabilitation would\nmean that the marriage ban in Turner could be justified\nbecause the prohibition furnished prisoners with an incen\ntive to behave well and thus earn early release. Cf. Safley\nv. Turner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1903750\"><a href=\"/opinion/1903750/safley-v-turner/\"><span class=\"volume\">586</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

S. 78, inmates had been threatened\nwith the loss of parole for attempting to exercise their\nmarriage rights).\n   In sum, rehabilitation is a valid penological interest,\nand deprivation is undoubtedly one valid tool in promoting\nrehabilitation. Nonetheless, to ensure that Turner contin\nues to impose meaningful limits on the promulgation of\nrules that infringe upon inmates\u2019 constitutional rights, see\nThornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U. S. 401, 414 (1989) (stating\nthat Turner\u2019s reasonableness standard \u201cis not toothless\u201d),\ncourts must be especially cautious in evaluating the con\nstitutionality of prison regulations that are supposedly\njustified primarily on that basis. When, as here, a reason\nable factfinder could conclude that challenged deprivations\nhave a tenuous logical connection to rehabilitation, or are\nexaggerated responses to a prison\u2019s legitimate interest in\nrehabilitation, prison officials are not entitled to judgment\n8                         BEARD v. BANKS\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nas a matter of law.\n   Petitioner argues that, because the various deprivations\nin the levels of disciplinary confinement short of LTSU\u20132\nare also severe, prison officials have no choice but to de\nprive inmates of core constitutional rights in LTSU\u20132 in\norder to make LTSU\u20132 more unattractive than other types\nof segregation. The fact that most States and the Federal\nGovernment run their prisons without resorting to the\ntype of ban at issue in this case, see Brief for American\nCivil Liberties Union et al. as Amici Curiae 21,3 casts\nserious doubt upon the need for the challenged constitu\ntional deprivations.\n   In any event, if we consider the severity of the other\nconditions of confinement in LTSU\u20132, it becomes obvious\nthat inmates have a powerful motivation to escape those\nconditions irrespective of the ban on newspapers, maga\nzines, and personal photographs. Inmates in LTSU\u20132 face\n23 hours a day in solitary confinement, are allowed only\none visitor per month, may not make phone calls except in\ncases of emergency, lack any access to radio or television,\nmay not use the prison commissary, are not permitted\nGeneral Educational Development (GED) or special educa\ntion study, and may not receive compensation under the\ninmate compensation system if they work as a unit jani\ntor. Although conditions in LTSU\u20131 are also harsh, in\nseveral respects unrelated to the challenged regulation,\nthey are far more appealing than the conditions in LTSU\u2013\n2. LTSU\u20131 inmates may have two visitors and may make\none phone call per month; they have access to the commis\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 This is presumably the type of evidence the plurality suggests that\n\nrespondent should have presented through an affidavit or deposition in\nresponse to petitioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment. See Jacklovich\nv. Simmons, 392 F. 3d 420, 428\u2013429 (CA10 2004) (noting that plaintiffs\nchallenging a prison regulation that limited access to publications had\nintroduced such evidence and concluding that prison officials were not\nentitled to summary judgment).\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                     9\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nsary; they are permitted in-cell GED or special education\nstudy; they are permitted a wider range of counseling\nservices; and they are eligible to obtain compensation\nunder the inmate compensation system. See App. 43, 102;\n399 F. 3d, at 148 (case below). The logical conclusion from\nthis is that, even if LTSU\u20132 prisoners were not deprived of\naccess to newspapers and personal photographs, they\nwould still have a strong incentive to gain promotion to\nLTSU\u20131.\n   In addition, prisoners in LTSU\u20131 do not regain access to\npersonal photographs, which means that the ban on pho\ntographs cannot be justified by petitioner\u2019s \u201c \u2018hope\u2019 \u201d that\ninmates will respond to the constitutional deprivations in\nLTSU\u20132 by improving their behavior so they may gradu\nate into LTSU\u20131, 399 F. 3d, at 142 (quoting petitioner\u2019s\ncounsel). Prisoners who \u201cgraduate\u201d out of the LTSU\u20131\nand back into the general prison population do regain\ntheir right to possess personal photographs, but they also\nregain so many additional privileges\u2014from ending their\nsolitary confinement to regaining access to television and\nradio\u2014that it strains credulity to believe that that the\npossibility of regaining the right to possess personal pho\ntographs if they eventually return to the general prison\npopulation would have any marginal effect on the actions\nof prisoners in LTSU\u20132.\n   In sum, the logical connection between the ban on news\npapers and (especially) the ban on personal photographs,\non one hand, and the rehabilitation interests posited by\npetitioner, on the other, is at best highly questionable.\nMoreover, petitioner did not introduce evidence that his\nproposed theory of behavior modification has any basis in\nhuman psychology, or that the challenged rule has in fact\nhad any rehabilitative effect on LTSU\u20132 inmates. Ibid.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 I emphasize the lack of evidentiary support for petitioner\u2019s position\n\nbecause I believe that, in light of the record currently before the Court,\n10                           BEARD v. BANKS\n\n                          STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nAccordingly, at least based on the present state of the\nrecord, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that prison\ners would have a sufficiently powerful incentive to gradu\nate out of LTSU\u20132 even absent the challenged rule, such\nthat the rule is not likely to have any appreciable behavior\nmodification effect.\n   The temporal character of LTSU\u20132 status further un\ndermines petitioner\u2019s argument that the ban on newspa\npers and photographs at issue in this case is reasonably\nrelated to a legitimate penological interest. All LTSU\ninmates must spend 90 days in LTSU\u20132 status. After\nthat, they receive a review every 30 days to determine if\nthey should be promoted to LTSU\u20131. That determination\nis made at the discretion of prison administrators, and is\nnot linked to any specific infraction or compliance. Peti\ntioner acknowledges that \u201c[a]n inmate in the LTSU can\nremain on Level 2 status indefinitely.\u201d App. 26. Indeed,\nas of August 2002, which is the most recent date for which\nthere is record evidence, roughly three-quarters of inmates\nplaced in LTSU\u20132 had remained in that status since the\ninception of the LTSU program over two years earlier. See\nid., at 138. See also ante, at 9 (plurality opinion). In\nshort, as the Court of Appeals explained:\n     \u201c[T]he LTSU Level 2 is a unique kind of segregation\n     with characteristics of both disciplinary and adminis\n     trative segregation. Inmates come to LTSU because\n     of \u2018unacceptable behaviors\u2019 in other institutions, but\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe logical connection between petitioner\u2019s stated interest in rehabilita\ntion and the prohibition on newspapers and photographs is exceedingly\ntenuous. When the logical connection between prison officials\u2019 stated\ninterests and the restrictions on prisoners\u2019 constitutional rights is not self-\nevident, we have considered whether prison officials proffered any evi\ndence that their regulations served the values they identified. See, e.g.,\nTurner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 98 (1987) (discussing lack of evidence in the\nrecord to support a ban on marriage as related to prison officials\u2019 stated\nobjectives).\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            11\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n    they have not all been adjudicated by a hearing officer\n    to have violated the [Department of Corrections\u2019]\n    rules. The LTSU is not a place where inmates are\n    sent for a discrete period of punishment, pursuant to a\n    specific infraction, but is a place for \u2018Long Term\u2019 seg\n    regation of the most incorrigible and difficult prison\n    ers for as long as they fall under that umbrella.\u201d 399\n    F. 3d, at 141 (citation omitted).\n   The indefinite nature of LTSU\u20132 confinement, and the\nfact that as of August 2002 a significant majority of in\nmates confined at LTSU\u20132 had remained there since the\ninception of the program over two years earlier, suggest\nthat the prohibition on newspapers, magazines, and per\nsonal photographs is an exaggerated response to the\nprison\u2019s legitimate interest in rehabilitation. It would be a\ndifferent case if prison officials had promulgated a regula\ntion that deprived LTSU-2 inmates of certain First\nAmendment rights for a short period of time in response to\nspecific disciplinary infractions. The indefinite depriva\ntions at issue here, however, obviously impose a much\ngreater burden on inmates\u2019 ability to exercise their consti\ntutional rights. Absent evidence that these indefinite\ndeprivations will be more effective in achieving rehabilita\ntion than shorter periods of deprivation, a reasonable\nfactfinder could conclude that the challenged regulation\n\u201csweeps much more broadly than can be explained by\n[prison officials\u2019] penological objectives,\u201d Turner, 482 U. S.,\nat 98, and is hence an exaggerated response to petitioner\u2019s\nlegitimate interest in rehabilitation.\n   In short, as with regard to the current state of the re\ncord concerning the connection between the challenged\nregulation and its effect on prison security, the record is\ninsufficient to conclude, as a matter of law, that petitioner\nhas established a reasonable relationship between his\nvalid interest in inmate rehabilitation and the prohibition\n12                     BEARD v.

The\nState may not \u201c \u2018invad[e] the sphere of intellect and spirit\nwhich it is the purpose of the First Amendment of our\nConstitution to reserve from all official control.\u2019 \u201d Wooley\nv. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705, 715 (1977) (quoting West Vir\nginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 642 (1943)). In\nthis case, the complete prohibition on secular, nonlegal\nnewspapers, newsletters, and magazines prevents prison\ners from \u201creceiv[ing] suitable access to social, political,\nesthetic, moral, and other ideas,\u201d which are central to the\ndevelopment and preservation of individual identity, and\nare clearly protected by the First Amendment, Red Lion\nBroadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 390 (1969). Simi\nlarly, the ban on personal photographs, for at least some\ninmates, interferes with the capacity to remember loved\nones, which is undoubtedly a core part of a person\u2019s \u201csphere\nof intellect and spirit.\u201d Moreover, it is difficult to imagine a\ncontext in which these First Amendment infringements\ncould be more severe; LTSU-2 inmates are in solitary con\nfinement for 23 hours a day with no access to radio or televi\nsion, are not permitted to make phone calls except in cases\nof emergency, and may only have one visitor per month.\nThey are essentially isolated from any meaningful contact\nwith the outside world. The severity of the constitutional\ndeprivations at issue in this case should give us serious\npause before concluding, as a matter of law, that the chal\nlenged regulation is consistent with the sovereign\u2019s duty to\ntreat prisoners in accordance with \u201cthe ethical tradition\nthat accords respect to the dignity and worth of every\nindividual.\u201d Overton v.

It then back\ntracks, distinguishing \u201cevidence of disputed facts\u201d from\n\u201cdisputed matters of professional judgment,\u201d and asserts\nthat \u201c[i]n respect to the latter, our inferences must accord\ndeference to the views of prison authorities.\u201d Ante, at 6.\nWhile Turner deference can and should be incorporated\ninto the evaluation of a motion for summary judgment,\nthat deference should come into play, pretrial, only after\nthe facts shown are viewed in the light most favorable to\nthe nonmoving party and all inferences are drawn in that\nparty\u2019s favor. See Liberty Lobby, 477 U. S., at 252\u2013255; cf.\nReeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U. S.\n133, 150\u2013151 (2000).\n   As I see it, on the limited record thus far made and\nwithout the benefit of trial, \u201cthe logical connection be\ntween the [no news journals] regulation and the asserted\ngoal\u201d could be found by a reasonable trier to be \u201cso remote\nas to render the policy arbitrary or irrational.\u201d Turner,\n482 U. S., at 89\u201390. The regulation denies The Christian\nScience Monitor to inmates housed in level 2 of the\nprison\u2019s long-term segregation unit but allows them The\nJewish Daily Forward, based on the determination of a\nprison official that the latter qualifies as a religious publi\ncation and the former does not. App. 179\u2013180; 399 F. 3d,\nat 147. Prisoners are allowed to read Harlequin romance\nnovels, but not to learn about the war in Iraq or Hurricane\nKatrina. The first justification cited by prison officials for\nimpinging on inmates\u2019 First Amendment rights in this\nway is too tenuous to be plausible. See ante, at 3\u20135\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting) (discussing security rationale);\n399 F. 3d, at 142\u2013144 (same). The second could be recited,\nroutinely, to immunize all manner of prison regulations\nfrom review for rationality. See ante, at 5\u201312 (STEVENS,\nJ., dissenting) (discussing deprivation/\u201crehabilitation\u201d\n4                      BEARD v. BANKS\n\n                     GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nrationale); 399 F. 3d, at 140\u2013142 (same).\n   Turner came to us after a full trial, and the Court\u2019s\nopinion in that case relied heavily on testimony elicited at\ntrial in evaluating the reasonableness of the regulations at\nissue. 482 U. S., at 91\u201393, 96\u201399. Overton likewise came to\nthis Court on a record made at trial. Overton v. Bazzetta,\n539 U. S. 126, 133 (2003). But in this case, the defender of\nthe regulation invites summary judgment. All inferences\nare to be drawn in favor of the prisoner opposing the regula\ntion, and the question is not which side has the better ar\ngument, but whether the Secretary has shown he is entitled\nto a judgment as a matter of law. By elevating the sum\nmary judgment opponent\u2019s burden to a height prisoners\nlacking nimble counsel cannot reach, the plurality effec\ntively tells prison officials they will succeed in cases of this\norder, and swiftly, while barely trying. It suffices for them\nto say, in our professional judgment the restriction is\nwarranted. The asserted right to read, see ante, at 1\u20132\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting), is indeed an \u201cimportant one,\u201d\nsee ante, at 12 (plurality opinion of BREYER, J.). Even in\nhighest security custody, a constitutional interest of that\norder merits more than peremptory treatment.\n                       *    *   *\n  For the reasons stated by JUSTICE STEVENS and in this\nopinion, I would affirm the Third Circuit\u2019s judgment re\nversing the award of summary judgment to the Secretary.\n</pre>",
