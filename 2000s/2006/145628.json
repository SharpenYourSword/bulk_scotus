OREGON\n\n        CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF OREGON\n\n    No. 04\u201310566.       Argued March 29, 2006\u2014Decided June 28, 2006*\nArticle 36(1)(b) of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations pro\n  vides that if a person detained by a foreign country \u201cso requests, the\n  competent authorities of the receiving State shall, without delay, in\n  form the consular post of the sending State\u201d of such detention, and\n  \u201cinform the [detainee] of his rights under this sub-paragraph.\u201d Arti\n  cle 36(2) specifies: \u201cThe rights referred to in paragraph 1 . . . shall be\n  exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving\n  State, subject to the proviso . . . that the said laws . . . must enable\n  full effect to be given to the purposes for which the rights accorded\n  under this Article are intended.\u201d Along with the Convention, the\n  United States ratified the Optional Protocol Concerning the Compul\n  sory Settlement of Disputes, which provides: \u201cDisputes arising out of\n  the . . . Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdiction of the\n  International Court of Justice [(ICJ)].\u201d The United States withdrew\n  from the Protocol on March 7, 2005.\n     Petitioner in No. 04\u201310566, Moises Sanchez-Llamas, is a Mexican\n  national. When he was arrested after an exchange of gunfire with\n  police, officers did not inform him that he could ask to have the Mexi\n  can Consulate notified of his detention. During interrogation, he\n  made incriminating statements regarding the shootout. Before his\n  trial for attempted murder and other offenses, Sanchez-Llamas\n  moved to suppress those statements on the ground, inter alia, that\n  the authorities had failed to comply with Article 36. The state court\n  denied that motion and Sanchez-Llamas was convicted and sentenced\n  to prison, and the Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed. The State Su\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 05\u201351, Bustillo v. Johnson, Director, Virginia\nDepartment of Corrections, on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Vir\nginia.\n2                    SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    preme Court also affirmed, concluding that Article 36 does not create\n    rights to consular access or notification that a detained individual\n    can enforce in a judicial proceeding.\n       Petitioner in No. 05\u201351, Mario Bustillo, a Honduran national, was\n    arrested and charged with murder, but police never informed him\n    that he could request that the Honduran Consulate be notified of his\n    detention. He was convicted and sentenced to prison, and his convic\n    tion and sentence were affirmed on appeal. He then filed a habeas\n    petition in state court arguing, for the first time, that authorities had\n    violated his right to consular notification under Article 36. The court\n    dismissed that claim as procedurally barred because he had failed to\n    raise it at trial or on appeal. The Virginia Supreme Court found no\n    reversible error.\nHeld: Even assuming without deciding that the Convention creates\n judicially enforceable rights, suppression is not an appropriate rem\n edy for a violation, and a State may apply its regular procedural de\n fault rules to Convention claims. Pp. 7\u201325.\n     (a) Because petitioners are not in any event entitled to relief, the\n Court need not resolve whether the Convention grants individuals\n enforceable rights, but assumes, without deciding, that Article 36\n does so. Pp. 7\u20138.\n     (b) Neither the Convention itself nor this Court\u2019s precedents apply\n ing the exclusionary rule support suppression of a defendant\u2019s state\n ments to police as a remedy for an Article 36 violation.\n     The Convention does not mandate suppression or any other specific\n remedy, but expressly leaves Article 36\u2019s implementation to domestic\n law: Article 36 rights must \u201cbe exercised in conformity with the laws\n . . . of the receiving State.\u201d Art. 36(2). Sanchez-Llamas\u2019 argument\n that suppression is appropriate under United States law and should\n be required under the Court\u2019s authority to develop remedies for the\n enforcement of federal law in state-court criminal proceedings is re\n jected. \u201cIt is beyond dispute that [this Court does] not hold a super\n visory power over the [state] courts.\u201d Dickerson v. United States, 530\n U. S. 428, 438. The exclusionary rule cases on which Sanchez-Llamas\n principally relies are inapplicable because they rest on the Court\u2019s\n supervisory authority over federal courts.\n     The Court\u2019s authority to create a judicial remedy applicable in\n state court must therefore lie, if anywhere, in the treaty itself.\n Where a treaty provides for a particular judicial remedy, courts must\n apply it as a requirement of federal law. Cf., e.g., United States v.\n Giordano, 416 U. S. 505, 524\u2013525. But where a treaty does not pro\n vide a particular remedy, either expressly or implicitly, it is not for\n the federal courts to impose one on the States through lawmaking of\n their own. Even if the \u201cfull effect\u201d language of Article 36(2) implicitly\n                   Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nrequires a judicial remedy, as Sanchez-Llamas claims, that Article\nequally requires that Article 36(1) rights be exercised in conformity\nwith domestic law. Under domestic law, the exclusionary rule is not\na remedy this Court applies lightly. It has been used primarily to de\nter certain Fourth and Fifth Amendment violations, including, e.g.,\nunconstitutional searches and seizures, Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643,\n655\u2013657, and confessions exacted in violation of the right against\ncompelled self-incrimination or due process, Dickerson, supra, at 435.\nIn contrast, Article 36 has nothing to do with searches or interroga\ntions and, indeed, does not guarantee defendants any assistance at\nall. It secures for foreign nationals only the right to have their consu\nlate informed of their arrest or detention\u2014not to have their consulate\nintervene, or to have police cease their investigation pending any\nsuch notice or intervention. Moreover, the failure to inform a defen\ndant of his Article 36 rights is unlikely, with any frequency, to pro\nduce unreliable confessions, see Watkins v. Sowders, 449 U. S. 341,\n347, or to give the police any practical advantage in obtaining in\ncriminating evidence, see Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206, 217.\nSuppression would also be a vastly disproportionate remedy for an\nArticle 36 violation. The interests Sanchez-Llamas claims Article 36\nadvances are effectively protected by other constitutional and statu\ntory requirements, including the right to an attorney and to protec\ntion against compelled self-incrimination. Finally, suppression is not\nthe only means of vindicating Article 36 rights. For example, diplo\nmatic avenues\u2014the primary means of enforcing the Vienna Conven\ntion\u2014remain open. Pp. 8\u201315.\n   (c) States may subject Article 36 claims to the same procedural de\nfault rules that apply generally to other federal-law claims.\n   This question is controlled by the Court\u2019s holding in Breard v.\nGreene, 523 U. S. 371, 375, that the petitioner\u2019s failure to raise an Ar\nticle 36 claim in state court prevented him from having the claim\nheard in a subsequent federal habeas proceeding. Bustillo\u2019s two rea\nsons why Breard does not control are rejected.\n   First, he argues that Breard\u2019s procedural default holding was un\nnecessary to the result because the petitioner there could not demon\nstrate prejudice from the default and because, in any event, the later\nenacted Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 su\nperseded any right the petitioner had under the Vienna Convention\nto have his claim heard on collateral review. Resolution of the proce\ndural default question, however, was the principal reason for denying\nthe Breard petitioner\u2019s claim, and the discussion of the issue occupied\nthe bulk of the Court\u2019s reasoning. See 523 U. S., at 375\u2013377. It is no\nanswer to argue that the procedural default holding was unnecessary\nsimply because the petitioner had several other ways to lose.\n4                     SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n       Second, Bustillo asserts that since Breard, the ICJ\u2019s LaGrand and\n    Avena decisions have interpreted the Convention to preclude the ap\n    plication of procedural default rules to Article 36 claims. Although\n    the ICJ\u2019s interpretation deserves \u201crespectful consideration,\u201d Breard,\n    supra, at 375, it does not compel the Court to reconsider Breard\u2019s un\n    derstanding of the Convention. \u201cThe judicial Power of the United\n    States\u201d is \u201cvested in one supreme Court . . . and . . . inferior courts.\u201d\n    U. S. Const., Art. III, \u00a71. That \u201cpower . . . extend[s] to . . . treaties,\u201d\n    Art. III, \u00a72, and includes the duty \u201cto say what the law is,\u201d Marbury\n    v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177. If treaties are to be given effect as\n    federal law, determining their meaning as a matter of federal law \u201cis\n    emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department,\u201d\n    headed by the \u201cone supreme Court.\u201d Ibid. Nothing in the ICJ\u2019s\n    structure or purpose suggests that its interpretations were intended\n    to be binding on U. S. courts. Even according \u201crespectful considera\n    tion,\u201d the ICJ\u2019s interpretation cannot overcome the plain import of\n    Article 36(2), which states that the rights it implements \u201cshall be ex\n    ercised in conformity with the laws . . . of the receiving State.\u201d In the\n    United States, this means that the rule of procedural default\u2014which\n    applies even to claimed violations of our own Constitution, see Engle\n    v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 129\u2014applies also to Vienna Convention\n    claims. Bustillo points to nothing in the drafting history of Article 36\n    or in the contemporary practice of other Convention signatories that\n    undermines this conclusion. LaGrand\u2019s conclusion that applying the\n    procedural default rule denies \u201cfull effect\u201d to the purposes of Article\n    36, by preventing courts from attaching legal significance to an Arti\n    cle 36 violation, is inconsistent with the basic framework of an adver\n    sary system. Such a system relies chiefly on the parties to raise sig\n    nificant issues and present them to the courts in the appropriate\n    manner at the appropriate time for adjudication. See Castro v.\n    United States, 540 U. S. 375, 386. Procedural default rules generally\n    take on greater importance in an adversary system than in the sort of\n    magistrate-directed, inquisitorial legal system characteristic of many\n    of the other Convention signatories. Under the ICJ\u2019s reading of \u201cfull\n    effect,\u201d Article 36 claims could trump not only procedural default\n    rules, but any number of other rules requiring parties to present\n    their legal claims at the appropriate time for adjudication, such as\n    statutes of limitations and prohibitions against filing successive ha\n    beas petitions. This sweeps too broadly, for it reads the \u201cfull effect\u201d\n    proviso in a way that leaves little room for the clear instruction in\n    Article 36(2) that Article 36 rights \u201cbe exercised in conformity with\n    the laws . . . of the receiving State.\u201d A comparison with a suspect\u2019s\n    rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, disposes of Bustillo\u2019s\n    \u201cfull effect\u201d claim. Although the failure to inform defendants of their\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                    5\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  right to consular notification may prevent them from becoming aware\n  of their Article 36 rights and asserting them at trial, precisely the\n  same thing is true of Miranda rights. Nevertheless, if a defendant\n  fails to raise his Miranda claim at trial, procedural default rules may\n  bar him from raising the claim in a subsequent postconviction pro\n  ceeding. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 87. Bustillo\u2019s attempt to\n  analogize an Article 36 claim to a claim under Brady v. Maryland,\n  373 U. S. 83, that the prosecution failed to disclose exculpatory evi\n  dence is inapt. Finally, his argument that Article 36 claims are most\n  appropriately raised post-trial or on collateral review under Massaro\n  v. United States, 538 U. S. 500, is rejected. See Dickerson, supra, at\n  438. Pp. 15\u201325.\n     (d) The Court\u2019s holding in no way disparages the Convention\u2019s im\n  portance. It is no slight to the Convention to deny petitioners\u2019 claims\n  under the same principles this Court would apply to claims under an\n  Act of Congress or the Constitution itself.

S. T. 77, 100\u2013101, T. I. A. S. No. 6820, ad\ndresses communication between an individual and his\nconsular officers when the individual is detained by au\nthorities in a foreign country. These consolidated cases\nconcern the availability of judicial relief for violations of\nArticle 36. We are confronted with three questions. First,\ndoes Article 36 create rights that defendants may invoke\nagainst the detaining authorities in a criminal trial or in a\npostconviction proceeding? Second, does a violation of\nArticle 36 require suppression of a defendant\u2019s statements\n2                  SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto police? Third, may a State, in a postconviction proceed\ning, treat a defendant\u2019s Article 36 claim as defaulted\nbecause he failed to raise the claim at trial? We conclude,\neven assuming the Convention creates judicially enforce\nable rights, that suppression is not an appropriate remedy\nfor a violation of Article 36, and that a State may apply its\nregular rules of procedural default to Article 36 claims.\nWe therefore affirm the decisions below.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   The Vienna Convention was drafted in 1963 with the\npurpose, evident in its preamble, of \u201ccontribut[ing] to the\ndevelopment of friendly relations among nations, irrespec\ntive of their differing constitutional and social systems.\u201d\n21 U. S. T., at 79. The Convention consists of 79 articles\nregulating various aspects of consular activities. At pre\nsent, 170 countries are party to the Convention. The\nUnited States, upon the advice and consent of the Senate,\nratified the Convention in 1969. Id., at 77.\n   Article 36 of the Convention concerns consular officers\u2019\naccess to their nationals detained by authorities in a\nforeign country. The article provides that \u201cif he so re\nquests, the competent authorities of the receiving State\nshall, without delay, inform the consular post of the send\ning State if, within its consular district, a national of that\nState is arrested or committed to prison or to custody\npending trial or is detained in any other manner.\u201d Art.\n36(1)(b), id., at 101.1 In other words, when a national of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 In\n       its entirety, Article 36 of the Vienna Convention states:\n  \u201c1. With a view to facilitating the exercise of consular functions\nrelating to nationals of the sending State:\n  \u201c(a) consular officers shall be free to communicate with nationals of\nthe sending State and to have access to them. Nationals of the sending\nState shall have the same freedom with respect to communication with\nand access to consular officers of the sending State;\n  \u201c(b) if he so requests, the competent authorities of the receiving State\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\none country is detained by authorities in another, the\nauthorities must notify the consular officers of the de\ntainee\u2019s home country if the detainee so requests. Article\n36(1)(b) further states that \u201c[t]he said authorities shall\ninform the person concerned [i.e., the detainee] without\ndelay of his rights under this sub-paragraph.\u201d Ibid. The\nConvention also provides guidance regarding how these\nrequirements, and the other requirements of Article 36,\nare to be implemented:\n     \u201cThe rights referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article\n     shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and\n     regulations of the receiving State, subject to the pro\n     viso, however, that the said laws and regulations\n     must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for\n     which the rights accorded under this Article are in\n     tended.\u201d Art. 36(2), ibid.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nshall, without delay, inform the consular post of the sending State if,\nwithin its consular district, a national of that State is arrested or\ncommitted to prison or to custody pending trial or is detained in any\nother manner. Any communication addressed to the consular post by\nthe person arrested, in prison, custody or detention shall also be for\nwarded by the said authorities without delay. The said authorities\nshall inform the person concerned without delay of his rights under this\nsub-paragraph;\n   \u201c(c) consular officers shall have the right to visit a national of the\nsending State who is in prison, custody or detention, to converse and\ncorrespond with him and to arrange for his legal representation. They\nshall also have the right to visit any national of the sending State who\nis in prison, custody or detention in their district in pursuance of a\njudgment. Nevertheless, consular officers shall refrain from taking\naction on behalf of a national who is in prison, custody or detention if\nhe expressly opposes such action.\n   \u201c2. The rights referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be\nexercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving\nState, subject to the proviso, however, that the said laws and regula\ntions must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for which the\nrights accorded under this Article are intended.\u201d 21 U.

OREGON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Along with the Vienna Convention, the United States\nratified the Optional Protocol Concerning the Compulsory\nSettlement of Disputes (Optional Protocol or Protocol),\nApr. 24, 1963, [1970] 21 U. S. T. 325, T. I. A. S. No. 6820.\nThe Optional Protocol provides that \u201c[d]isputes arising out\nof the interpretation or application of the Convention shall\nlie within the compulsory jurisdiction of the International\nCourt of Justice [(ICJ)],\u201d and allows parties to the Protocol\nto bring such disputes before the ICJ.

Annan, Secre\ntary-General of the United Nations.\n                             B\n   Petitioner Moises Sanchez-Llamas is a Mexican na\ntional. In December 1999, he was involved in an exchange\nof gunfire with police in which one officer suffered a gun\nshot wound in the leg. Police arrested Sanchez-Llamas\nand gave him warnings under Miranda v. Arizona, 384\nU. S. 436 (1966), in both English and Spanish. At no time,\nhowever, did they inform him that he could ask to have\nthe Mexican Consulate notified of his detention.\n   Shortly after the arrest and Miranda warnings, police\ninterrogated Sanchez-Llamas with the assistance of an\ninterpreter. In the course of the interrogation, Sanchez-\nLlamas made several incriminating statements regarding\nthe shootout with police. He was charged with attempted\naggravated murder, attempted murder, and several other\noffenses. Before trial, Sanchez-Llamas moved to suppress\nthe statements he made to police. He argued that sup\npression was warranted because the statements were\nmade involuntarily and because the authorities had failed\nto comply with Article 36 of the Vienna Convention. The\ntrial court denied the motion. The case proceeded to trial,\nand Sanchez-Llamas was convicted and sentenced to 201\u20442\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

We granted certiorari. 546 U. S. ___ (2005).\n                               C\n  Petitioner Mario Bustillo, a Honduran national, was\nwith several other men at a restaurant in Springfield,\nVirginia, on the night of December 10, 1997. That eve\nning, outside the restaurant, James Merry was struck in\nthe head with a baseball bat as he stood smoking a ciga\nrette. He died several days later. Several witnesses at the\nscene identified Bustillo as the assailant. Police arrested\nBustillo the morning after the attack and eventually\ncharged him with murder. Authorities never informed\nhim that he could request to have the Honduran Consu\nlate notified of his detention.\n  At trial, the defense pursued a theory that another man,\nknown as \u201cSirena,\u201d was responsible for the attack. Two\ndefense witnesses testified that Bustillo was not the killer.\nOne of the witnesses specifically identified the attacker as\nSirena. In addition, a third defense witness stated that\nshe had seen Sirena on a flight to Honduras the day after\nthe victim died. In its closing argument before the jury,\nthe prosecution dismissed the defense theory about Si\nrena. See App. in No. 05\u201351, p. 21 (\u201cThis whole Sirena\nthing, I don\u2019t want to dwell on it too much. It\u2019s very con\nvenient that Mr. Sirena apparently isn\u2019t available\u201d). A\njury convicted Bustillo of first-degree murder, and he was\nsentenced to 30 years in prison. His conviction and sen\n6                  SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntence were affirmed on appeal.\n   After his conviction became final, Bustillo filed a peti\ntion for a writ of habeas corpus in state court. There, for\nthe first time, he argued that authorities had violated his\nright to consular notification under Article 36 of the Vi\nenna Convention. He claimed that if he had been advised\nof his right to confer with the Honduran Consulate, he\n\u201cwould have done so without delay.\u201d App. in No. 05\u201351,\np. 60. Moreover, the Honduran Consulate executed an\naffidavit stating that \u201cit would have endeavoured to help\nMr. Bustillo in his defense\u201d had it learned of his detention\nprior to trial. Id., at 74. Bustillo insisted that the consu\nlate could have helped him locate Sirena prior to trial. His\nhabeas petition also argued, as part of a claim of ineffective\nassistance of counsel, that his attorney should have advised\nhim of his right to notify the Honduran Consulate of his\narrest and detention.2\n   The state habeas court dismissed Bustillo\u2019s Vienna\nConvention claim as \u201cprocedurally barred\u201d because he had\nfailed to raise the issue at trial or on appeal. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. in No. 05\u201351, p. 43a. The court also denied Bust\nillo\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, ruling that\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Bustillo\u2019s habeas petition also presented newly acquired evidence\n\nthat tended to cast doubt on his conviction. Most notably, he produced\na secretly recorded videotape in which Sirena admitted killing Merry\nand stated that Bustillo had been wrongly convicted. App. in No. 05\u2013\n51, pp. 38, 54. In addition, Bustillo argued that the prosecution vio\nlated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), by failing to disclose that\non the night of the crime, police had questioned a man named \u201cJulio C.\nOsorto,\u201d who is now known to be the same man as \u201cSirena.\u201d The police\nreport concerning the encounter stated that Sirena appeared to have\nketchup on his pants. Bustillo contends that these stains might in fact\nhave been the victim\u2019s blood. The Commonwealth disputes this. The\nstate habeas court found \u201cno evidence of any transfer of the victim\u2019s\nblood to the assailant,\u201d and concluded that the undisclosed encounter\nbetween police and Sirena was not material under Brady.

Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). App. in No.\n05\u201351, p. 132. In an order refusing Bustillo\u2019s petition for\nappeal, the Supreme Court of Virginia found \u201cno reversi\nble error\u201d in the habeas court\u2019s dismissal of the Vienna\nConvention claim.

S. ___ (2005).\n                               II\n   We granted certiorari as to three questions presented in\nthese cases: (1) whether Article 36 of the Vienna Conven\ntion grants rights that may be invoked by individuals in a\njudicial proceeding; (2) whether suppression of evidence is\na proper remedy for a violation of Article 36; and (3)\nwhether an Article 36 claim may be deemed forfeited\nunder state procedural rules because a defendant failed to\nraise the claim at trial.\n   As a predicate to their claims for relief, Sanchez-Llamas\nand Bustillo each argue that Article 36 grants them an\nindividually enforceable right to request that their consu\nlar officers be notified of their detention, and an accompa\nnying right to be informed by authorities of the availabil\nity of consular notification. Respondents and the United\nStates, as amicus curiae, strongly dispute this contention.\nThey argue that \u201cthere is a presumption that a treaty will\nbe enforced through political and diplomatic channels,\nrather than through the courts.\u201d Brief for United States 11;\nibid. (quoting Head Money Cases, 112 U.

Because we conclude that\nSanchez-Llamas and Bustillo are not in any event entitled\n8               SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v.

Therefore, for purposes of\naddressing petitioners\u2019 claims, we assume, without decid\ning, that Article 36 does grant Bustillo and Sanchez-\nLlamas such rights.\n                               A\n   Sanchez-Llamas argues that the trial court was re\nquired to suppress his statements to police because au\nthorities never told him of his rights under Article 36. He\nrefrains, however, from arguing that the Vienna Conven\ntion itself mandates suppression. We think this a wise\nconcession. The Convention does not prescribe specific\nremedies for violations of Article 36. Rather, it expressly\nleaves the implementation of Article 36 to domestic law:\nRights under Article 36 are to \u201cbe exercised in conformity\nwith the laws and regulations of the receiving State.\u201d Art.\n36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. As far as the text of the Conven\ntion is concerned, the question of the availability of the\nexclusionary rule for Article 36 violations is a matter of\ndomestic law.\n   It would be startling if the Convention were read to\nrequire suppression. The exclusionary rule as we know it\nis an entirely American legal creation. See Bivens v. Six\nUnknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, 415 (1971)\n(Burger, C. J., dissenting) (the exclusionary rule \u201cis unique\nto American jurisprudence\u201d). More than 40 years after the\ndrafting of the Convention, the automatic exclusionary\nrule applied in our courts is still \u201cuniversally rejected\u201d by\nother countries.

They argue that\nour cases suppressing evidence obtained in violation of\nfederal statutes are grounded in our supervisory authority\nover the federal courts\u2014an authority that does not extend\nto state-court proceedings. Brief for Respondent in No.\n04\u201310566, pp. 42\u201343; Brief for United States 32\u201334; see\nMcNabb v. United States, 318 U.

Unless required to do so by the Convention itself,\nthey argue, we cannot direct Oregon courts to exclude\nSanchez-Llamas\u2019 statements from his criminal trial.\n  To the extent Sanchez-Llamas argues that we should\ninvoke our supervisory authority, the law is clear: \u201cIt is\nbeyond dispute that we do not hold a supervisory power\nover the courts of the several States.\u201d Dickerson v. United\nStates, 530 U. S. 428, 438 (2000); see also Smith v. Phillips,\n455 U.

The cases on which Sanchez-Llamas principally\nrelies are inapplicable in light of the limited reach of our\nsupervisory powers. Mallory and McNabb plainly rest on\nour supervisory authority.        Mallory, supra, at 453;\nMcNabb, supra, at 340. And while Miller is not clear\nabout its authority for requiring suppression, we have\nunderstood it to have a similar basis. See Ker v.

S. ____ (2006)             11\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   We also agree with the State of Oregon and the United\nStates that our authority to create a judicial remedy appli\ncable in state court must lie, if anywhere, in the treaty itself.\nUnder the Constitution, the President has the power, \u201cby\nand with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make\nTreaties.\u201d Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. The United States ratified the\nConvention with the expectation that it would be inter\npreted according to its terms. See Restatement (Third) of\nForeign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7325(1) (1986)\n(\u201cAn international agreement is to be interpreted in good\nfaith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to\nits terms in their context and in the light of its object and\npurpose\u201d). If we were to require suppression for Article 36\nviolations without some authority in the Convention, we\nwould in effect be supplementing those terms by enlarging\nthe obligations of the United States under the Convention.\nThis is entirely inconsistent with the judicial function. Cf.\nThe Amiable Isabella, 6 Wheat. 1, 71 (1821) (Story, J.) (\u201c[T]o\nalter, amend, or add to any treaty, by inserting any clause,\nwhether small or great, important or trivial, would be on our\npart an usurpation of power, and not an exercise of judicial\nfunctions. It would be to make, and not to construe a\ntreaty\u201d).\n   Of course, it is well established that a self-executing\ntreaty binds the States pursuant to the Supremacy Clause,\nand that the States therefore must recognize the force of the\ntreaty in the course of adjudicating the rights of litigants.\nSee, e.g., Hauenstein v. Lynham, 100 U. S. 483 (1880). And\nwhere a treaty provides for a particular judicial remedy,\nthere is no issue of intruding on the constitutional pre\nrogatives of the States or the other federal branches.\nCourts must apply the remedy as a requirement of federal\nlaw. Cf. 18 U. S. C. \u00a72515; United States v. Giordano, 416\nU. S. 505, 524\u2013525 (1974). But where a treaty does not\nprovide a particular remedy, either expressly or implicitly, it\nis not for the federal courts to impose one on the States\n12              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthrough lawmaking of their own.\n   Sanchez-Llamas argues that the language of the Con\nvention implicitly requires a judicial remedy because it\nstates that the laws and regulations governing the exer\ncise of Article 36 rights \u201cmust enable full effect to be given\nto the purposes for which the rights . . . are intended,\u201d Art.\n36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101 (emphasis added). In his view,\nalthough \u201cfull effect\u201d may not automatically require an\nexclusionary rule, it does require an appropriate judicial\nremedy of some kind. There is reason to doubt this inter\npretation. In particular, there is little indication that\nother parties to the Convention have interpreted Article\n36 to require a judicial remedy in the context of criminal\nprosecutions. See Department of State Answers to Ques\ntions Posed by the First Circuit in United States v. Nai\nFook Li, No. 97\u20132034 etc., p. A\u20139 (Oct. 15, 1999) (\u201cWe are\nunaware of any country party to the [Vienna Convention]\nthat provides remedies for violations of consular notifica\ntion through its domestic criminal justice system\u201d).\n   Nevertheless, even if Sanchez-Llamas is correct that\nArticle 36 implicitly requires a judicial remedy, the Con\nvention equally states that Article 36 rights \u201cshall be\nexercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of\nthe receiving State.\u201d Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. Under\nour domestic law, the exclusionary rule is not a remedy we\napply lightly. \u201c[O]ur cases have repeatedly emphasized\nthat the rule\u2019s \u2018costly toll\u2019 upon truth-seeking and law\nenforcement objectives presents a high obstacle for those\nurging application of the rule.\u201d Pennsylvania Bd. of Proba\ntion and Parole v. Scott, 524 U. S. 357, 364\u2013365 (1998).\nBecause the rule\u2019s social costs are considerable, suppres\nsion is warranted only where the rule\u2019s \u201c \u2018remedial objec\ntives are thought most efficaciously served.\u2019 \u201d United\nStates v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 908 (1984) (quoting United\nStates v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 348 (1974)).\n   We have applied the exclusionary rule primarily to deter\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)             13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nconstitutional violations. In particular, we have ruled that\nthe Constitution requires the exclusion of evidence ob\ntained by certain violations of the Fourth Amendment, see\nTaylor v. Alabama, 457 U. S. 687, 694 (1982) (arrests in\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment); Mapp v. Ohio, 367\nU. S. 643, 655\u2013657 (1961) (unconstitutional searches and\nseizures), and confessions exacted by police in violation of\nthe right against compelled self-incrimination or due proc\ness, see Dickerson, 530 U. S., at 435 (failure to give Miranda\nwarnings); Payne v. Arkansas, 356 U. S. 560, 568 (1958)\n(involuntary confessions).\n   The few cases in which we have suppressed evidence for\nstatutory violations do not help Sanchez-Llamas. In those\ncases, the excluded evidence arose directly out of statutory\nviolations that implicated important Fourth and Fifth\nAmendment interests. McNabb, for example, involved the\nsuppression of incriminating statements obtained during a\nprolonged detention of the defendants, in violation of a\nstatute requiring persons arrested without a warrant to be\npromptly presented to a judicial officer. We noted that the\nstatutory right was intended to \u201cavoid all the evil implica\ntions of secret interrogation of persons accused of crime,\u201d\n318 U. S., at 344, and later stated that McNabb was \u201cre\nsponsive to the same considerations of Fifth Amendment\npolicy that . . . face[d] us . . . as to the states\u201d in Miranda,\n384 U. S., at 463. Similarly, in Miller, we required sup\npression of evidence that was the product of a search\nincident to an unlawful arrest. 357 U. S., at 305; see\nCalifornia v. Hodari D., 499 U. S. 621, 624 (1991) (\u201cWe have\nlong understood that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection\nagainst \u2018unreasonable . . . seizures\u2019 includes seizure of the\nperson\u201d).\n   The violation of the right to consular notification, in\ncontrast, is at best remotely connected to the gathering of\nevidence. Article 36 has nothing whatsoever to do with\nsearches or interrogations. Indeed, Article 36 does not\n14              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nguarantee defendants any assistance at all. The provision\nsecures only a right of foreign nationals to have their\nconsulate informed of their arrest or detention\u2014not to\nhave their consulate intervene, or to have law enforcement\nauthorities cease their investigation pending any such\nnotice or intervention. In most circumstances, there is\nlikely to be little connection between an Article 36 viola\ntion and evidence or statements obtained by police.\n   Moreover, the reasons we often require suppression for\nFourth and Fifth Amendment violations are entirely\nabsent from the consular notification context. We require\nexclusion of coerced confessions both because we disap\nprove of such coercion and because such confessions tend\nto be unreliable. Watkins v. Sowders, 449 U. S. 341, 347\n(1981). We exclude the fruits of unreasonable searches on\nthe theory that without a strong deterrent, the constraints\nof the Fourth Amendment might be too easily disregarded\nby law enforcement. Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S.\n206, 217 (1960). The situation here is quite different. The\nfailure to inform a defendant of his Article 36 rights is\nunlikely, with any frequency, to produce unreliable confes\nsions. And unlike the search-and-seizure context\u2014where\nthe need to obtain valuable evidence may tempt authori\nties to transgress Fourth Amendment limitations\u2014police\nwin little, if any, practical advantage from violating Arti\ncle 36. Suppression would be a vastly disproportionate\nremedy for an Article 36 violation.\n   Sanchez-Llamas counters that the failure to inform\ndefendants of their right to consular notification gives\nthem \u201ca misleadingly incomplete picture of [their] legal\noptions,\u201d Brief for Petitioner in No. 04\u201310566, p. 42, and\nthat suppression will give authorities an incentive to abide\nby Article 36.\n   Leaving aside the suggestion that it is the role of police\ngenerally to advise defendants of their legal options, we\nthink other constitutional and statutory requirements\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\neffectively protect the interests served, in Sanchez-Llamas\u2019\nview, by Article 36. A foreign national detained on suspi\ncion of crime, like anyone else in our country, enjoys under\nour system the protections of the Due Process Clause.\nAmong other things, he is entitled to an attorney, and is\nprotected against compelled self-incrimination. See Wong\nWing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228, 238 (1896) (\u201c[A]ll\npersons within the territory of the United States are enti\ntled to the protection guaranteed by\u201d the Fifth and Sixth\nAmendments). Article 36 adds little to these \u201clegal options,\u201d\nand we think it unnecessary to apply the exclusionary rule\nwhere other constitutional and statutory protections\u2014many\nof them already enforced by the exclusionary rule\u2014\nsafeguard the same interests Sanchez-Llamas claims are\nadvanced by Article 36.\n   Finally, suppression is not the only means of vindicating\nVienna Convention rights. A defendant can raise an\nArticle 36 claim as part of a broader challenge to the\nvoluntariness of his statements to police. If he raises an\nArticle 36 violation at trial, a court can make appropriate\naccommodations to ensure that the defendant secures, to\nthe extent possible, the benefits of consular assistance. Of\ncourse, diplomatic avenues\u2014the primary means of enforc\ning the Convention\u2014also remain open.\n   In sum, neither the Vienna Convention itself nor our\nprecedents applying the exclusionary rule support sup\npression of Sanchez-Llamas\u2019 statements to police.\n                             B\n  The Virginia courts denied petitioner Bustillo\u2019s Article\n36 claim on the ground that he failed to raise it at trial or\non direct appeal. The general rule in federal habeas cases\nis that a defendant who fails to raise a claim on direct\nappeal is barred from raising the claim on collateral re\nview. See Massaro v. United States, 538 U. S. 500, 504\n(2003); Bousley v. United States, 523 U. S. 614, 621 (1998).\n16              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThere is an exception if a defendant can demonstrate both\n\u201ccause\u201d for not raising the claim at trial, and \u201cprejudice\u201d\nfrom not having done so. Massaro, supra, at 504. Like\nmany States, Virginia applies a similar rule in state post-\nconviction proceedings, and did so here to bar Bustillo\u2019s\nVienna Convention claim. Normally, in our review of\nstate-court judgments, such rules constitute an adequate\nand independent state-law ground preventing us from\nreviewing the federal claim. Coleman v. Thompson, 501\nU. S. 722, 729 (1991). Bustillo contends, however, that\nstate procedural default rules cannot apply to Article 36\nclaims. He argues that the Convention requires that\nArticle 36 rights be given \u201c \u2018full effect\u2019 \u201d and that Virginia\u2019s\nprocedural default rules \u201cprevented any effect (much less\n\u2018full effect\u2019) from being given to\u201d those rights. Brief for\nPetitioner in No. 05\u201351, p. 35.\n   This is not the first time we have been asked to set aside\nprocedural default rules for a Vienna Convention claim.\nRespondent Johnson and the United States persuasively\nargue that this question is controlled by our decision in\nBreard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371 (1998) (per curiam). In\nBreard, the petitioner failed to raise an Article 36 claim in\nstate court\u2014at trial or on collateral review\u2014and then\nsought to have the claim heard in a subsequent federal\nhabeas proceeding. Id., at 375. He argued that \u201cthe Con\nvention is the \u2018supreme law of the land\u2019 and thus trumps\nthe procedural default doctrine.\u201d Ibid. We rejected this\nargument as \u201cplainly incorrect,\u201d for two reasons. Ibid.\nFirst, we observed, \u201cit has been recognized in interna\ntional law that, absent a clear and express statement to\nthe contrary, the procedural rules of the forum State\ngovern the implementation of the treaty in that State.\u201d\nIbid. Furthermore, we reasoned that while treaty protec\ntions such as Article 36 may constitute supreme federal\nlaw, this is \u201cno less true of provisions of the Constitution\nitself, to which rules of procedural default apply.\u201d Id., at\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n376. In light of Breard\u2019s holding, Bustillo faces an uphill\ntask in arguing that the Convention requires States to set\naside their procedural default rules for Article 36 claims.\n  Bustillo offers two reasons why Breard does not control\nhis case. He first argues that Breard\u2019s holding concerning\nprocedural default was \u201cunnecessary to the result,\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioner in No. 05\u201351, p. 45, because the petitioner\nthere could not demonstrate prejudice from the default\nand because, in any event, a subsequent federal statute\u2014\nthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996, 110 Stat. 1214\u2014superseded any right the petitioner\nhad under the Vienna Convention to have his claim heard\non collateral review. We find Bustillo\u2019s contention unper\nsuasive. Our resolution of the procedural default question\nin Breard was the principal reason for the denial of the\npetitioner\u2019s claim, and the discussion of the issue occupied\nthe bulk of our reasoning. See 523 U. S., at 375\u2013377. It is\nno answer to argue, as Bustillo does, that the holding in\nBreard was \u201cunnecessary\u201d simply because the petitioner in\nthat case had several ways to lose. See Richmond Screw\nAnchor Co. v. United States, 275 U. S. 331, 340 (1928).\n  Bustillo\u2019s second reason is less easily dismissed. He\nargues that since Breard, the ICJ has interpreted the\nVienna Convention to preclude the application of proce\ndural default rules to Article 36 claims. The LaGrand\nCase (F. R. G. v. U. S.), 2001 I. C. J. 466 (Judgment of\nJune 27) (LaGrand), and the Case Concerning Avena and\nother Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. No.\n128 (Judgment of Mar. 31) (Avena), were brought before\nthe ICJ by the governments of Germany and Mexico,\nrespectively, on behalf of several of their nationals facing\ndeath sentences in the United States. The foreign gov\nernments claimed that their nationals had not been in\nformed of their right to consular notification. They further\nargued that application of the procedural default rule to\ntheir nationals\u2019 Vienna Convention claims failed to give\n18                 SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cfull effect\u201d to the purposes of the Convention, as required\nby Article 36. The ICJ agreed, explaining that the defen\ndants had procedurally defaulted their claims \u201cbecause of\nthe failure of the American authorities to comply with\ntheir obligation under Article 36.\u201d LaGrand, supra, at\n497, \u00b691; see also Avena, supra, \u00b6113. Application of the\nprocedural default rule in such circumstances, the ICJ\nreasoned, \u201cprevented [courts] from attaching any legal\nsignificance\u201d to the fact that the violation of Article 36\nkept the foreign governments from assisting in their na\ntionals\u2019 defense. LaGrand, supra, at 497, \u00b691; see also\nAvena, supra, \u00b6113.\n   Bustillo argues that LaGrand and Avena warrant revis\niting the procedural default holding of Breard. In a simi\nlar vein, several amici contend that \u201cthe United States is\nobligated to comply with the Convention, as interpreted by\nthe ICJ.\u201d Brief for ICJ Experts 11 (emphases added). We\ndisagree. Although the ICJ\u2019s interpretation deserves\n\u201crespectful consideration,\u201d Breard, supra, at 375, we con\nclude that it does not compel us to reconsider our under\nstanding of the Convention in Breard.4\n   Under our Constitution, \u201c[t]he judicial Power of the\nUnited States\u201d is \u201cvested in one supreme Court, and in\nsuch inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to\ntime ordain and establish.\u201d Art. III, \u00a71. That \u201cjudicial\nPower . . . extend[s] to . . . Treaties.\u201d Id., \u00a72. And, as Chief\nJustice Marshall famously explained, that judicial power\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The dissent, in light of LaGrand and Avena, \u201cwould read Breard . . .\n\nas not saying that the Convention never trumps any procedural default\nrule.\u201d Post, at 26 (opinion of BREYER, J.). This requires more than\n\u201creading an exception into Breard\u2019s language,\u201d post, at 27, amounting\ninstead to overruling Breard\u2019s plain holding that the Convention does\nnot trump the procedural default doctrine. While the appeal of such a\ncourse to a Breard dissenter may be clear, see 523 U. S., at 380\n(BREYER, J., dissenting), \u201crespectful consideration\u201d of precedent should\nbegin at home.\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

If treaties are to be\ngiven effect as federal law under our legal system, deter\nmining their meaning as a matter of federal law \u201cis em\nphatically the province and duty of the judicial depart\nment,\u201d headed by the \u201cone supreme Court\u201d established by\nthe Constitution. Ibid.; see also Williams v. Taylor, 529\nU. S. 362, 378\u2013379 (2000) (opinion of STEVENS, J.) (\u201cAt the\ncore of [the judicial] power is the federal courts\u2019 independent\nresponsibility\u2014independent from its coequal branches in\nthe Federal Government, and independent from the sepa\nrate authority of the several States\u2014to interpret federal\nlaw\u201d). It is against this background that the United States\nratified, and the Senate gave its advice and consent to, the\nvarious agreements that govern referral of Vienna Con\nvention disputes to the ICJ.\n  Nothing in the structure or purpose of the ICJ suggests\nthat its interpretations were intended to be conclusive on\nour courts.5 The ICJ\u2019s decisions have \u201cno binding force\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 The dissent\u2019s extensive list of lower court opinions that have \u201clooked\n\nto the ICJ for guidance,\u201d post, at 21\u201322, is less impressive than first\nappears. Many of the cited opinions merely refer to, or briefly describe,\nICJ decisions without in any way relying on them as authority. See,\ne.g., Committee of United States Citizens Living in Nicaragua v.\nReagan, 859 F. 2d 929, 932, 935 (CADC 1988); Conservation Law\nFoundation of New England v. Secretary of Interior, 790 F. 2d 965, 967\n(CA1 1986); Narenji v. Civiletti, 617 F. 2d 745, 748 (CADC 1979); Diggs\nv. Richardson, 555 F. 2d 848, 849 (CADC 1976); Rogers v. Societe\nInternationale Pour Participations Industrielles et Commerciales, S. A.,\n278 F. 2d 268, 273, n. 3 (CADC 1960) (Fahy, J., dissenting). Others cite\nICJ opinions alongside law review articles for general propositions\nabout international law. See, e.g., McKesson Corp. v. Islamic Republic\nof Iran, 52 F. 3d 346, 352 (CADC 1995); Princz v. Federal Republic of\nGermany, 26 F. 3d 1166, 1180, 1184 (CADC 1994) (Wald, J., dissent\ning); Sadat v. Mertes, 615 F. 2d 1176, 1187, n. 14 (CA7 1980); United\nStates v. Postal, 589 F. 2d 862, 869 (CA5 1979). Moreover, all but two\nof the cited decisions from this Court concern technical issues of bound\nary demarcation. See post, at 21.\n20              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexcept between the parties and in respect of that particu\nlar case,\u201d Statute of the International Court of Justice,\nArt. 59, 59 Stat. 1062, T. S. No. 993 (1945) (emphasis\nadded). Any interpretation of law the ICJ renders in the\ncourse of resolving particular disputes is thus not binding\nprecedent even as to the ICJ itself; there is accordingly\nlittle reason to think that such interpretations were in\ntended to be controlling on our courts. The ICJ\u2019s principal\npurpose is to arbitrate particular disputes between na\ntional governments. Id., at 1055 (ICJ is \u201cthe principal\njudicial organ of the United Nations\u201d); see also Art. 34, id.,\nat 1059 (\u201cOnly states [i.e., countries] may be parties in\ncases before the Court\u201d). While each member of the\nUnited Nations has agreed to comply with decisions of the\nICJ \u201cin any case to which it is a party,\u201d United Nations\nCharter, Art. 94(1), 59 Stat. 1051, T. S. No. 933 (1945), the\nCharter\u2019s procedure for noncompliance\u2014referral to the\nSecurity Council by the aggrieved state\u2014contemplates\nquintessentially international remedies, Art. 94(2), ibid.\n   In addition, \u201c[w]hile courts interpret treaties for them\nselves, the meaning given them by the departments of\ngovernment particularly charged with their negotiation\nand enforcement is given great weight.\u201d Kolovrat v. Ore\ngon, 366 U. S. 187, 194 (1961). Although the United\nStates has agreed to \u201cdischarge its international obliga\ntions\u201d in having state courts give effect to the decision in\nAvena, it has not taken the view that the ICJ\u2019s interpreta\ntion of Article 36 is binding on our courts. President Bush,\nMemorandum for the Attorney General (Feb. 28, 2005),\nApp. to Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in\nMedell\u00edn v. Dretke, O. T. 2004, No. 04\u20135928, p. 9a. More\nover, shortly after Avena, the United States withdrew\nfrom the Optional Protocol concerning Vienna Convention\ndisputes. Whatever the effect of Avena and LaGrand\nbefore this withdrawal, it is doubtful that our courts\nshould give decisive weight to the interpretation of a\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntribunal whose jurisdiction in this area is no longer recog\nnized by the United States.\n   LaGrand and Avena are therefore entitled only to the\n\u201crespectful consideration\u201d due an interpretation of an\ninternational agreement by an international court.\nBreard, 523 U. S., at 375. Even according such considera\ntion, the ICJ\u2019s interpretation cannot overcome the plain\nimport of Article 36. As we explained in Breard, the pro\ncedural rules of domestic law generally govern the imple\nmentation of an international treaty. Ibid. In addition,\nArticle 36 makes clear that the rights it provides \u201cshall be\nexercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of\nthe receiving State\u201d provided that \u201cfull effect . . . be given\nto the purposes for which the rights accorded under this\nArticle are intended.\u201d Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. In\nthe United States, this means that the rule of procedural\ndefault\u2014which applies even to claimed violations of our\nConstitution, see Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 129\n(1982)\u2014applies also to Vienna Convention claims. Busti\nllo points to nothing in the drafting history of Article 36 or\nin the contemporary practice of other signatories that\nundermines this conclusion.\n   The ICJ concluded that where a defendant was not\nnotified of his rights under Article 36, application of the\nprocedural default rule failed to give \u201cfull effect\u201d to the\npurposes of Article 36 because it prevented courts from\nattaching \u201clegal significance\u201d to the Article 36 violation.\nLaGrand, 2001 I. C. J., at 497\u2013498, \u00b6\u00b690\u201391. This reason\ning overlooks the importance of procedural default rules in\nan adversary system, which relies chiefly on the parties to\nraise significant issues and present them to the courts in\nthe appropriate manner at the appropriate time for adju\ndication. See Castro v. United States, 540 U. S. 375, 386\n(2003) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment) (\u201cOur adversary system is designed around the\npremise that the parties know what is best for them, and\n22              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nare responsible for advancing the facts and arguments\nentitling them to relief\u201d). Procedural default rules are\ndesigned to encourage parties to raise their claims promptly\nand to vindicate \u201cthe law\u2019s important interest in the finality\nof judgments.\u201d Massaro, 538 U. S., at 504. The conse\nquence of failing to raise a claim for adjudication at the\nproper time is generally forfeiture of that claim. As a\nresult, rules such as procedural default routinely deny \u201clegal\nsignificance\u201d\u2014in the Avena and LaGrand sense\u2014to other\nwise viable legal claims.\n   Procedural default rules generally take on greater im\nportance in an adversary system such as ours than in the\nsort of magistrate-directed, inquisitorial legal system\ncharacteristic of many of the other countries that are\nsignatories to the Vienna Convention. \u201cWhat makes a\nsystem adversarial rather than inquisitorial is . . . the\npresence of a judge who does not (as an inquisitor does)\nconduct the factual and legal investigation himself, but\ninstead decides on the basis of facts and arguments pro\nand con adduced by the parties.\u201d McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501\nU. S. 171, 181, n. 2 (1991). In an inquisitorial system, the\nfailure to raise a legal error can in part be attributed to the\nmagistrate, and thus to the state itself. In our system,\nhowever, the responsibility for failing to raise an issue\ngenerally rests with the parties themselves.\n   The ICJ\u2019s interpretation of Article 36 is inconsistent\nwith the basic framework of an adversary system. Under\nthe ICJ\u2019s reading of \u201cfull effect,\u201d Article 36 claims could\ntrump not only procedural default rules, but any number\nof other rules requiring parties to present their legal\nclaims at the appropriate time for adjudication. If the\nState\u2019s failure to inform the defendant of his Article 36\nrights generally excuses the defendant\u2019s failure to comply\nwith relevant procedural rules, then presumably rules\nsuch as statutes of limitations and prohibitions against\nfiling successive habeas petitions must also yield in the\n                       Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                       23\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\nface of Article 36 claims. This sweeps too broadly, for it\nreads the \u201cfull effect\u201d proviso in a way that leaves little\nroom for Article 36\u2019s clear instruction that Article 36\nrights \u201cshall be exercised in conformity with the laws and\nregulations of the receiving State.\u201d Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T.,\nat 101.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The  dissent would read the ICJ\u2019s decisions to require that proce\ndural default rules give way only where \u201cthe State is unwilling to\nprovide some other effective remedy, for example (if the lawyer acts\nincompetently in respect to Convention rights of which the lawyer was\naware) an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.\u201d Post, at 25 (opinion\nof BREYER, J.). But both LaGrand and Avena indicate that the avail\nability of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not an adequate\nremedy for an Article 36 violation. See LaGrand Case (F. R. G. v.\nU. S.), 2001 I. C. J. 466, 497, \u00b691 (Judgment of June 27) (requiring\nsuspension of state procedural default rule even though \u201cUnited States\ncourts could and did examine the professional competence of counsel\nassigned to the indigent LaGrands by reference to United States\nconstitutional standards\u201d); see also Case Concerning Avena and other\nMexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. No. 128, \u00b6134 (Judg\nment of Mar. 31).\n   To the extent the dissent suggests that the ICJ\u2019s decisions could be\nread to prevent application of procedural default rules where a defen\ndant\u2019s attorney is unaware of Article 36, see post, at 24\u201325 (opinion of\nBREYER, J.), this interpretation of the Convention is in sharp conflict\nwith the role of counsel in our system. \u201cAttorney ignorance or inadver\ntence is not \u2018cause\u2019 because the attorney is the petitioner\u2019s agent when\nacting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation, and the petitioner\nmust \u2018bear the risk of attorney error.\u2019 \u201d Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S.\n722, 753 (1991) (quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 488 (1986)).\nUnder our system, an attorney\u2019s lack of knowledge does not excuse the\ndefendant\u2019s default, unless the attorney\u2019s overall representation falls\nbelow what is required by the Sixth Amendment. In any event, Bustillo\nhimself does not argue that the applicability of procedural default rules\nhinges on whether a foreign national\u2019s attorney was aware of Article 36.\nSee Brief for Petitioner in No. 05\u201351, p. 38 (\u201c[A] lawyer may not,\nconsistent with the purposes of Article 36, unilaterally forfeit a foreign\nnational\u2019s opportunity to communicate with his consulate\u201d). In fact,\nBustillo has conceded that his \u201cattorney at trial was aware of his\nclient\u2019s rights under the Vienna Convention.\u201d App. in No. 05\u201351,\np. 203, n. 5.\n24              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Much as Sanchez-Llamas cannot show that suppression\nis an appropriate remedy for Article 36 violations under\ndomestic law principles, so too Bustillo cannot show that\nnormally applicable procedural default rules should be\nsuspended in light of the type of right he claims. In this\nregard, a comparison of Article 36 and a suspect\u2019s rights\nunder Miranda disposes of Bustillo\u2019s claim. Bustillo con\ntends that applying procedural default rules to Article 36\nrights denies such rights \u201cfull effect\u201d because the violation\nitself\u2014i.e., the failure to inform defendants of their right\nto consular notification\u2014prevents them from becoming\naware of their Article 36 rights and asserting them at\ntrial. Of course, precisely the same thing is true of rights\nunder Miranda. Police are required to advise suspects\nthat they have a right to remain silent and a right to an\nattorney. See Miranda, 384 U. S., at 479; see also\nDickerson, 530 U. S., at 435. If police do not give such\nwarnings, and counsel fails to object, it is equally true that\na suspect may not be \u201caware he even had such rights until\nwell after his trial had concluded.\u201d Brief for Petitioner in\nNo. 05\u201351, p. 35. Nevertheless, it is well established that\nwhere a defendant fails to raise a Miranda claim at trial,\nprocedural default rules may bar him from raising the\nclaim in a subsequent postconviction proceeding. Wain\nwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 87 (1977).\n   Bustillo responds that an Article 36 claim more closely\nresembles a claim, under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83\n(1963), that the prosecution failed to disclose exculpatory\nevidence\u2014a type of claim that often can be asserted for\nthe first time only in postconviction proceedings. See\nUnited States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U. S. 74, 83, n. 9\n(2004). The analogy is inapt. In the case of a Brady claim,\nit is impossible for the defendant to know as a factual\nmatter that a violation has occurred before the exculpa\ntory evidence is disclosed. By contrast, a defendant is well\naware of the fact that he was not informed of his Article 36\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            25\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrights, even if the legal significance of that fact eludes him.\n   Finally, relying on Massaro v. United States, 538 U. S.\n500, Bustillo argues that Article 36 claims \u201care most ap\npropriately raised post-trial or on collateral review.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioner in No. 05\u201351, p. 39. Massaro held that\nclaims of ineffective assistance of counsel may be raised\nfor the first time in a proceeding under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72255.\nThat decision, however, involved the question of the\nproper forum for federal habeas claims. Bustillo, by con\ntrast, asks us to require the States to hear Vienna Conven\ntion claims raised for the first time in state postconviction\nproceedings. Given that the Convention itself imposes no\nsuch requirement, we do not perceive any grounds for us\nto revise state procedural rules in this fashion. See\nDickerson, supra, at 438.\n   We therefore conclude, as we did in Breard, that claims\nunder Article 36 of the Vienna Convention may be sub\njected to the same procedural default rules that apply\ngenerally to other federal-law claims.\n                        *    *      *\n  Although these cases involve the delicate question of the\napplication of an international treaty, the issues in many\nways turn on established principles of domestic law. Our\nholding in no way disparages the importance of the Vienna\nConvention. The relief petitioners request is, by any meas\nure, extraordinary. Sanchez-Llamas seeks a suppression\nremedy for an asserted right with little if any connection to\nthe gathering of evidence; Bustillo requests an exception to\nprocedural rules that is accorded to almost no other right,\nincluding many of our most fundamental constitutional\nprotections. It is no slight to the Convention to deny\npetitioners\u2019 claims under the same principles we would\napply to an Act of Congress, or to the Constitution itself.\n  The judgments of the Supreme Court of Oregon and the\nSupreme Court of Virginia are affirmed.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

As to the suppression and procedural\ndefault issues, I join the Court\u2019s judgment. The dissenting\nopinion veers away from the two cases here for review,\nimagining other situations unlike those at hand. In nei\nther of the cases before us would I remand for further\nproceedings.\n  I turn first to the question whether a violation of Article\n36 requires suppression of statements to police officers in\nSanchez-Llamas\u2019 case and others like it. Shortly after his\narrest and in advance of any police interrogation, Sanchez-\nLlamas received the warnings required by Miranda v.\nArizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), in both English and Spanish.\nTr. 122 (Nov. 16, 2000). He indicated that he understood\n2                 SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                 GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthose warnings, id., at 123, telling the police that he had\nlived in the United States for approximately 11 years, id., at\n124, 143, 177. After a break in questioning, Sanchez-\nLlamas again received Miranda warnings in Spanish, and\nagain indicated that he understood them. Id., at 129, 176.\nSanchez-Llamas, with his life experience in the United\nStates, scarcely resembles the uncomprehending detainee\nimagined by JUSTICE BREYER, post, at 30. Such a detainee\nwould have little need to invoke the Vienna Convention, for\nMiranda warnings a defendant is unable to comprehend\ngive the police no green light for interrogation. Moran v.\nBurbine, 475 U. S. 412, 421 (1986) (a defendant\u2019s waiver of\nMiranda rights must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent,\ni.e., \u201cthe product of a free and deliberate choice . . . made\nwith a full awareness of both the nature of the right being\nabandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon\nit\u201d); United States v. Garibay, 143 F. 3d 534, 537\u2013540 (CA9\n1998) (defendant, who had difficulty understanding English,\ndid not knowingly and intelligently waive his Miranda\nrights where the police recited the Miranda warnings only\nin English); United States v. Short, 790 F. 2d 464, 469 (CA6\n1986) (defendant\u2019s limited comprehension of English cast\nsubstantial doubt on the validity of her Miranda waiver).1\n   In contrast to Miranda warnings, which must be given\non the spot before the police interrogate, Article 36 of the\nVienna Convention does not require the arresting author\nity to contact the consular post instantly. See Case Con\ncerning Avena and other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Before\n           trial, Sanchez-Llamas moved to suppress his statements to\npolice on voluntariness grounds.

Nor does that\nArticle demand that questioning await notice to, and a\nresponse from, consular officials.2 It is unsurprising,\ntherefore, that the well researched dissenting opinion has\nnot found even a single case in which any court, any place\nhas in fact found suppression an appropriate remedy\nbased on no provision of domestic law, but solely on an\narresting officer\u2019s failure to comply with Article 36 of the\nVienna Convention. See post, at 32; ante, at 9, n. 3.\n  The Court points out, and I agree, that in fitting circum\nstances, a defendant might successfully \u201craise an Article\n36 claim as part of a broader challenge to the voluntari\nness of [a detainee\u2019s] statements to police.\u201d Ante, at 15. In\nthat way, \u201cfull effect\u201d could be given to Article 36 in a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 See Declaration of Ambassador Maura A.

But\nthe question presented here is whether suppression is\nwarranted simply because the State\u2019s authorities failed to\ncomply with Article 36 of the Vienna Convention. Neither\nthe Convention itself nor the practice of our treaty part\nners establishes Sanchez-Llamas\u2019 entitlement to such a\nremedy. See El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd. v. Tsui Yuan\nTseng, 525 U. S. 155, 175\u2013176 (1999) (construing the\nWarsaw Convention in accord with the views of the United\nStates\u2019s treaty partners).\n   As to the procedural default issue, I note first two\nanomalies. The Court explains, and I agree, that it would\nbe extraordinary to hold that defendants, unaware of their\nMiranda rights because the police failed to convey the\nrequired warnings, would be subject to a State\u2019s proce\ndural default rules, but defendants not told of Article 36\nrights would face no such hindrance. See ante, at 24.\nFurthermore, as the dissent apparently recognizes, in the\nfederal court system, a later-in-time statute, codifying a\nfederal procedural default rule, would \u201csupersed[e] any\ninconsistent provision in the Convention.\u201d Post, at 25\u201326\n(citing Breard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371 (1998) (per curiam)).\nIn my view, it would be unseemly, to say the least, for this\nCourt to command state courts to relax their identical, or\neven less stringent procedural default rules, while federal\ncourts operate without constraint in this regard. Post, at\n26. That state of affairs, surely productive of friction in\nour federal system, should be resisted if there is a plausi\nble choice, i.e., if a reasonable interpretation of the federal\nstatute and international accord would avoid the conflict.\n   Critical for me, Bustillo has conceded that his \u201cattorney\nat trial was aware of his client\u2019s rights under the Vienna\nConvention.\u201d App. in No. 05\u201351, p. 203, n. 5.

Had counsel\ndone so, the trial court could have made \u201cappropriate\naccommodations to ensure that the defendant secure[d], to\nthe extent possible, the benefits of consular assistance.\u201d\nAnte, at 15.3\n  In short, if there are some times when a Convention\nviolation, standing alone, might warrant suppression, or\nthe displacement of a State\u2019s ordinarily applicable proce\ndural default rules, neither Sanchez-Llamas\u2019 case nor\nBustillo\u2019s belongs in that category.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Furthermore, once Bustillo became aware of his Vienna Convention\n\nrights, nothing prevented him from raising an ineffective-assistance-of\ncounsel claim predicated on his trial counsel\u2019s failure to assert the\nState\u2019s violation of those rights. Through such a claim, as the dissent\nacknowledges, see post, at 16, 19, 25, 29, \u201cfull effect\u201d could have been\ngiven to Article 36, without dishonoring state procedural rules that are\ncompatible with due process. Bustillo did not include a Vienna-\nConvention-based, ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim along with his\ndirect Vienna Convention claim in his initial habeas petition. He later\nsought to amend his petition to add an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\nclaim, but the court held that the amendment did not relate back to the\ninitial pleading. Tr. of Oral Arg. 26, 42. The state court therefore\nrejected Bustillo\u2019s ineffectiveness claim as barred by the applicable\nstate statute of limitations. App. 132.

A criminal defendant may, at\ntrial or in a postconviction proceeding, raise the claim that\nstate authorities violated the Convention in his case. My\nanswer to the second question is that sometimes state\nprocedural default rules must yield to the Convention\u2019s\ninsistence that domestic laws \u201cenable full effect to be given\nto the purposes for which\u201d Article 36\u2019s \u201crights . . . are\nintended.\u201d Art. 36(2), 21 U.

After answering these\nquestions, I would remand these cases, thereby permitting\nthe States to apply their own procedural and remedial\nlaws, but with the understanding that the Federal Consti\ntution requires that the application of those laws be con\nsistent with the Convention\u2019s demand for an effective\nremedy for an Article 36 violation.

The United States and 169 other na\ntions have ratified the Convention. Its adoption in 1963\nwas perhaps \u201cthe single most important event in the\nentire history of the consular institution.\u201d L. Lee, Consu\nlar Law and Practice 26 (2d ed. 1991).

The\nUnited States ratified the Convention in 1969.\n   Article 36 of the Convention governs relations between a\nconsulate and its nationals, particularly those who have\nbeen arrested by the host country. Its object is to assure\nconsular communication and assistance to such nationals,\nwho may not fully understand the host country\u2019s legal\nregime or even speak its language.

In addition, the ICJ stated that in the case before it,\napplication of a procedural default rule (that is, the rule\nthat the LaGrands could not bring their Convention\nclaims in habeas proceedings because they had not raised\nthose claims at trial) violated Article 36(2) of the Conven\ntion because it \u201chad the effect of preventing \u2018full effect\n[from being] given to the purposes for which the rights\naccorded under this article are intended.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 22, \u00b691\n(quoting Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101). In the ICJ\u2019s view,\nit was \u201cthe failure of the American authorities to comply\u201d\nwith Article 36 that prevented the LaGrands from raising\ntheir claims earlier. LaGrand, supra, at 22, \u00b691.\n   In Mexico\u2019s case, the ICJ reiterated its view that Article\n36, in addition to imposing obligations on member nations,\n6               SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nalso allows foreign nationals to bring claims based on\nthose violations in domestic judicial proceedings. The ICJ\nnoted that, as a matter of international law, breach of a\ntreaty ordinarily \u201c \u2018involves an obligation to make repara\ntion in an adequate form.\u2019 \u201d Avena, supra, \u00b6119 (quoting\nFactory at Chorz\u00f3w, Jurisdiction, 1927, P. C. I. J., ser. A,\nNo. 9, p. 21). Applying that principle to the Convention,\nthe ICJ concluded that \u201cthe remedy to make good . . .\nviolations [of Article 36] should consist in an obligation on\nthe United States to permit review and reconsideration of\nthese nationals\u2019 cases by the United States courts . . . with\na view to ascertaining whether in each case the violation\n. . . caused actual prejudice to the defendant in the process\nof administration of criminal justice.\u201d Avena, 2004 I. C. J.,\n\u00b6121 (emphasis added). The court added that this \u201creview\nand reconsideration,\u201d to be \u201ceffective,\u201d must \u201cfully ex\namin[e] and tak[e] into account\u201d any such prejudice to the\ndefendant. Id., \u00b6138. The ICJ declined to specify the\nmeans by which American courts should provide such\n\u201creview and reconsideration.\u201d Instead, the ICJ said, the\nappropriate remedy depends upon an examination of \u201cthe\nconcrete circumstances of each case\u201d and should be deter\nmined \u201cby the United States courts concerned in the proc\ness of their review and reconsideration.\u201d Id., \u00b6127.\n    In respect to procedural default, the ICJ referenced\nwhat it said in LaGrand, while adding the critically im\nportant qualification that the cases in which the Conven\ntion blocked application of a procedural default rule were\nthose in which it was \u201cthe failure of the United States\nitself to inform\u201d an arrested foreign national of his right to\ncontact the consulate that \u201cprecluded counsel from being\nin a position to have raised the question of a violation of\nthe Vienna Convention in the initial trial.\u201d Avena, supra,\n\u00b6113.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

The Court assumes that the answer to this\nquestion is \u201cyes,\u201d but it does not decide the matter because\nit concludes in any event that the petitioners are not\nentitled to the remedies they seek. As explained below, I\nwould resolve those remedial questions differently.\nHence, I must decide, rather than assume, the answer to\nthe first question presented.\n  Regardless, the first question raises an important issue\nof federal law that has arisen hundreds of times in the\nlower federal and state courts. See generally Wooster,\nConstruction and Application of Vienna Convention on\n8               SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nConsular Relations (VCCR), Requiring That Foreign Con\nsulate Be Notified When One of Its Nationals Is Arrested,\n175 A. L. R. Fed. 243 (2002) (collecting federal cases).\nThose courts have divided as to the proper answer. Com\npare Cardenas v. Dretke, 405 F. 3d 244 (CA5 2005) (defen\ndant cannot bring Convention claim in judicial proceed\ning); United States v. Emuegbunam, 268 F. 3d 377 (CA6\n2001) (same); State v. Martinez-Rodriguez, 2001\u2013NMSC\u2013\n029, 33 P. 3d 267 (2001) (same); 338 Ore. 267, 108 P. 3d\n573 (2005) (same); Shackleford v. Commonwealth, 262 Va.\n196, 547 S. E. 2d 899 (2001) (same), with Jogi v. Voges,\n425 F. 3d 367 (CA7 2005) (defendant can bring Convention\nclaim in judicial proceeding). And the issue often arises in\na legal context where statutes or procedural requirements\narguably block this Court\u2019s speedy review. See Medell\u00edn v.\nDretke, 544 U. S. 660 (2005) (per curiam). We granted the\npetitions for certiorari in significant part in order to decide\nthis question. And, given its importance, we should do so.\n   In answering the question it is common ground that the\nConvention is \u201cself-executi[ng].\u201d See S. Exec. Rep. No. 91\u2013\n9, p. 5 (1969); see also Brief for Respondent in No. 04\u2013\n10566, pp. 9\u201310; Brief for Respondent in No. 05\u201351, p. 23.\nThat is to say, the Convention \u201coperates of itself without\nthe aid of any legislative provision.\u201d Foster v. Neilson, 2\nPet. 253, 314 (1829). The parties also agree that we need\nnot decide whether the Convention creates a \u201cprivate right\nof action,\u201d i.e., a private right that would allow an individ\nual to bring a lawsuit for enforcement of the Convention or\nfor damages based on its violation. Rather, the question\nhere is whether the Convention provides, in these cases,\nlaw applicable in legal proceedings that might have been\nbrought irrespective of the Vienna Convention claim, here\nan ordinary criminal appeal and an ordinary postconvic\ntion proceeding.\n   Bustillo, for example, has brought an action under a\nVirginia statute that allows any convicted person to seek\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrelease from custody on the ground that \u201che is detained\nwithout lawful authority.\u201d Va. Code Ann. \u00a78.01\u2013654(A)(1)\n(Lexis 2005). Sanchez-Llamas has challenged his state\ncriminal conviction on direct appeal, and in that proceed\ning he is entitled to claim that his conviction violates state\nor federal law. In both cases the petitioners argue that a\ncourt decision favoring the prosecution would violate the\nConvention (as properly interpreted), and therefore the\nConstitution forbids any such decision. See U. S. Const.,\nArt. VI, cl. 2. This argument in effect claims that the\nConvention itself provides applicable law that here would\nfavor the petitioners if, but only if, they are correct as to\ntheir interpretation of the Convention (which is, of course,\na different matter).\n  The petitioners must be right in respect to their claim\nthat the Convention provides law that here courts could\napply in their respective proceedings. The Convention is a\ntreaty. And \u201call Treaties made . . . under the Authority of\nthe United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land;\nand the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby.\u201d\nU. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. As Chief Justice Marshall long\nago explained, under the Supremacy Clause a treaty is \u201cto\nbe regarded in courts of justice as equivalent to an act of\nthe legislature, whenever it operates of itself without the\naid of any legislative provision.\u201d Foster, supra, at 314.\n  Directly to the point, this Court stated long ago that a\ntreaty \u201cis a law of the land as an act of Congress is, when\never its provisions prescribe a rule by which the rights of\nthe private citizen or subject may be determined. And\nwhen such rights are of a nature to be enforced in a court\nof justice,\u201d in such a case the court is to \u201cresor[t] to the\ntreaty for a rule of decision for the case before it as it\nwould to a statute.\u201d Head Money Cases, 112 U. S. 580,\n598\u2013599 (1884).\n  As noted above, see supra, at 8, the parties agree that\nthe Convention \u201coperates of itself without the aid of any\n10              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlegislative provision.\u201d Foster, supra, at 314. The question,\nthen, is the one this Court set forth in the Head Money\nCases: Does the Convention set forth a \u201claw\u201d with the legal\nstature of an Act of Congress? And as the Court ex\nplained, we are to answer that question by asking, does\nthe Convention \u201cprescribe a rule by which the rights of the\nprivate citizen . . . may be determined\u201d? Are the obliga\ntions set forth in Article 36(1)(b) \u201cof a nature to be en\nforced in a court of justice\u201d?\n   The \u201cnature\u201d of the Convention provisions raised by the\npetitioners indicates that they are intended to set forth\nstandards that are judicially enforceable. Those provi\nsions consist of the rights of a foreign national \u201carrested\u201d\nor \u201cdetained in any other manner\u201d (1) to have, on his\n\u201creques[t],\u201d the \u201cconsular post\u201d \u201cinform[ed]\u201d of that arrest\nor detention; (2) to have forwarded \u201cwithout delay\u201d any\n\u201ccommunication addressed to the consular post\u201d; and (3) to\nbe \u201cinform[ed] . . . without delay\u201d of those two \u201crights.\u201d\nArt. 36(1)(b), 21 U. S. T., at 101. These rights do not differ\nin their \u201cnature\u201d from other procedural rights that courts\ncommonly enforce. Cf. U. S. Const., Amdt. 6 (\u201cIn all crimi\nnal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to\nbe informed of the nature and cause of the accusation\u201d);\nibid. (\u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy\nthe right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his\ndefence\u201d); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966).\n   Moreover, the language of Article 36 speaks directly of\nthe \u201crights\u201d of the individual foreign national. See Art.\n36(1)(b), 21 U. S. T., at 101 (\u201cThe said authorities shall\ninform the person concerned without delay of his rights\nunder this sub-paragraph\u201d (emphasis added)). Article 36\nthus stands in stark contrast to other provisions of the\nConvention, which speak in terms of the rights of the\nmember nations or consular officials. Cf. Art. 9, id., at 86\n(discussing \u201cthe right of any of the Contracting Parties to\nfix the designation of consular officers\u201d (emphasis added));\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

What more would the statute have to say? See\nMedell\u00edn, 544 U. S., at 687 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting) (\u201cAnd\nif a statute were to provide, for example, that arresting\nauthorities \u2018shall inform a detained person without delay\nof his right to counsel,\u2019 \u201d what \u201cmore would be required\u201d to\npermit \u201ca defendant\u201d to \u201cinvoke that statute\u201d?).\n    Further, this Court has routinely permitted individuals\nto enforce treaty provisions similar to Article 36 in domes\ntic judicial proceedings. In United States v. Rauscher, 119\nU. S. 407, 410\u2013411 (1886), for example, this Court con\ncluded that the defendant could raise as a defense in his\nfederal criminal trial the violation of an extradition treaty\nthat said, \u201c \u2018It is agreed that the United States and Her\nBritannic Majesty shall, upon mutual requisitions by them\n. . . deliver up to justice all persons\u2019 \u201d charged with certain\ncrimes in the other country. Similarly, in Kolovrat v.\nOregon, 366 U. S. 187, 191, n. 6 (1961), the Court held that\nforeign nationals could challenge a state law limiting their\nright to recover an inheritance based on a treaty providing\nthat \u201c \u2018[i]n all that concerns the right of acquiring, possess\ning or disposing of every kind of property . . . citizens of\n[each country who reside in the other] shall enjoy the\nrights which the respective laws grant . . . in each of these\nstates to the subjects of the most favored nation.\u2019 \u201d And in\nAsakura v. Seattle, 265 U. S. 332, 340 (1924), the Court\nallowed a foreign national to challenge a city ordinance\n12              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nforbidding noncitizens from working as pawnbrokers\nunder a treaty stating that \u201c \u2018citizens or subjects of each of\nthe High Contracting Parties shall have liberty . . . to\ncarry on trade\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018generally to do anything incident to\nor necessary for trade upon the same terms as native\ncitizens or subjects.\u2019 \u201d\n   In all these cases, the Court recognized that (1) a treaty\nobligated the United States to treat foreign nationals in a\ncertain manner; (2) the obligation had been breached by\nthe Government\u2019s conduct; and (3) the foreign national\ncould therefore seek redress for that breach in a judicial\nproceeding, even though the treaty did not specifically\nmention judicial enforcement of its guarantees or even\nexpressly state that its provisions were intended to confer\nrights on the foreign national. Language and context\nargue yet more strongly here in favor of permitting a\ncriminal defendant in an appropriate case to find in the\nConvention a law to apply in the proceeding against him.\n   In addition, the Government concedes that individual\nconsular officials may enforce other provisions of the Con\nvention in American courts. For example, Article 43(1)\ngrants consular officials immunity from \u201cthe jurisdiction of\nthe\u201d host country\u2019s \u201cjudicial or administrative authorities\u201d\nfor \u201cacts performed in the exercise of consular functions.\u201d\n21 U. S. T., at 104. The federal courts have held that a\nconsular official may raise Article 43(1) in a judicial pro\nceeding, even though that provision does not expressly\nmention a judicial remedy. See, e.g., Risk v. Halvorsen,\n936 F. 2d 393, 397 (CA9 1991); Gerritsen v. de la Madrid\nHurtado, 819 F. 2d 1511, 1515\u20131516 (CA9 1987); see also\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14, n. 2 (citing\nwith approval these cases). What in Article 36 warrants\ntreating it differently in this respect?\n   Finally, the international tribunal that the United\nStates agreed would resolve disputes about the interpreta\ntion of the Convention, the ICJ, has twice ruled that an\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          13\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\narrested foreign national may raise a violation of the\narresting authorities\u2019 obligation to \u201cinform [him] without\ndelay of his rights under\u201d Article 36(1) in an American\njudicial proceeding. See Avena, 2004 I. C. J. No. 128;\nLaGrand, 2001 I. C. J. 466. That conclusion, as an \u201cinter\npretation of an international agreement by an interna\ntional court\u201d deserves our \u201c \u2018respectful consideration.\u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 21. That \u201crespectful consideration,\u201d for reasons I\nshall explain, see infra, at 18\u201321, counsels in favor of an\ninterpretation that is consistent with the ICJ\u2019s reading of\nthe Convention here.\n   The Government says to the contrary that Article 36 is\n\u201caddressed solely to the rights of States and not private\nindividuals\u201d; hence, a foreign national may not claim in an\nAmerican court that a State has convicted him without the\nconsular notification that Article 36 requires. Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 7. But its arguments are\nnot persuasive. The Government rests this conclusion\nprimarily upon its claim that there is a \u201clong-established\npresumption that treaties and other international agree\nments do not create judicially enforceable individual\nrights.\u201d Id., at 11.\n   The problem with that argument is that no such pre\nsumption exists. The Government cites three cases in\nsupport of its position, Charlton v. Kelly, 229 U. S. 447,\n474 (1913); Whitney v. Robertson, 124 U. S. 190, 195\n(1888); and Foster, 2 Pet., at 306\u2013307. The first of these,\nCharlton, says that the question whether a treaty has\nbeen abrogated by another nation\u2019s violations is a matter\nwith which \u201c \u2018judicial tribunals have nothing to do.\u2019 \u201d 229\nU. S., at 474. The second, Whitney, says that whether a\nsubsequent federal statute that abrogates a treaty violates\nthe United States\u2019 treaty obligations is a matter that has\n\u201cnot been confided to the judiciary.\u201d 124 U. S., at 195.\nThe third, Foster, says that in \u201ca controversy between two\nnations concerning national boundary, it is scarcely possi\n14              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nble that the courts of either should refuse to abide by the\nmeasures adopted by its own government.\u201d 2 Pet., at 307.\nWhat have these issues to do with the present one? How\ndo these cases support the presumption that the Govern\nment claims?\n   Regardless, as I have just said, see supra, at 9, the Head\nMoney Cases make clear that a treaty may confer certain\nenforceable \u201crights upon the citizens or subjects of one of\nthe nations residing in the territorial limits of the other.\u201d\n112 U. S., at 598; see also 2 Restatement (Third) on For\neign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7907 (1986) (here\ninafter Restatement) (\u201cA private person having rights\nagainst the United States under an international agree\nment may assert those rights in courts in the United\nStates\u201d). And the language of the Convention makes clear\nthat it is such a treaty. Indeed, to my knowledge no other\nnation\u2019s courts (or perhaps no more than one) have held to\nthe contrary. The cases cited by the respondents and the\nGovernment do not say otherwise. See Judgment of Nov.\n7, 2001, 5 BGHSt 116 (Germany) (deciding in light of\nLaGrand that the Convention creates individual rights,\nbut declining to suppress confession); Queen v. Abbrederis\n(1981) 51 F. L. R. 99, 115 (Ct. Crim. App. New South\nWales (Australia)) (deciding that Convention does not\n\u201caffect the carrying out of an investigation by interroga\ntion of a foreign person coming to this country\u201d). But see\nQueen v. Van Bergen [2000] 261 A. R. 387, 390 (Ct. App.\nAlberta (Canada)) (noting in dictum that the Convention\n\u201ccreates an obligation between states and is not one owed\nto the national,\u201d but affirming denial of suppression mo\ntion on the ground that \u201cthere was in any event no proven\nprejudice to\u201d the defendant). See also Queen v. Partak,\n[2001] 160 C. C. C. 3d 553 (Ont. Super. Ct. of J.)

Avagli\nano, 457 U. S. 176, 184\u2013185 (1982). I agree with this\npresumption. But the Executive\u2019s views on our treaty\nobligations are \u201cnot conclusive.\u201d Ibid.; see Perkins v. Elg,\n307 U. S. 325, 328, 337\u2013342 (1939) (declining to adopt\nExecutive\u2019s treaty interpretation); Johnson v. Browne, 205\nU. S. 309, 319\u2013321 (1907) (same); De Lima v. Bidwell, 182\nU. S. 1, 181, 194\u2013199 (1901) (same). Where language, the\nnature of the right, and the ICJ\u2019s interpretation of the\ntreaty taken separately or together so strongly point to an\nintent to confer enforceable rights upon an individual, I\ncannot find in the simple fact of the Executive Branch\u2019s\ncontrary view sufficient reason to adopt the Government\u2019s\ninterpretation of the Convention.\n  Accordingly, I would allow the petitioners to raise their\nclaims based on violations of the Convention in their\nrespective state-court proceedings.\n                               III\n   The more difficult issue, I believe, concerns the nature\nof the Convention\u2019s requirements as to remedy. In par\nticular, Bustillo\u2019s case concerns a state procedural default\nrule. When, if ever, does the Convention require a state\ncourt to set aside such a rule in order to hear a criminal\ndefendant\u2019s claim that the police did not \u201cinform\u201d him of\nhis \u201cright\u201d to communicate with his \u201cconsular post\u201d? Art.\n36(1)(b), 21 U. S. T., at 101. The Court says that the\nanswer is \u201cnever.\u201d See ante, at 15\u201325. In its view, the\nConvention does not under any circumstances trump a\nState\u2019s ordinary procedural rules requiring a defendant to\nassert his claims at trial or lose them forever.\n   In my view, Article 36 of the Convention requires a less\nabsolute answer. Article 36 says that the rights it sets\nforth \u201cshall be exercised in conformity with the laws and\n16              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nregulations of the receiving State,\u201d but it instantly adds,\n\u201csubject to the proviso . . . that the said laws and regula\ntions must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for\nwhich the [Article 36] rights are . . . intended.\u201d Art. 36(2),\n21 U. S. T., at 101 (emphasis added). The proviso means\nthat a State\u2019s ordinary procedural default rules apply\nunless (1) the defendant\u2019s failure to raise a Convention\nmatter (e.g., that police failed to inform him of his Article\n36 rights) can itself be traced to the failure of the police (or\nother governmental authorities) to inform the defendant of\nthose Convention rights, and (2) state law does not pro\nvide any other effective way for the defendant to raise that\nissue (say, through a claim of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel).\n   Several considerations lead to this conclusion. First, as\nI have just noted, Article 36 says both that its rights \u201cshall\nbe exercised in conformity with\u201d the host country\u2019s \u201claws\nand regulations\u201d and that those \u201claws and regulations\nmust enable full effect to be given\u201d to the purposes for\nwhich those rights \u201care intended.\u201d This interpretation\nmakes both the \u201cconformity\u201d requirement and the \u201cfull\neffect\u201d requirement meaningful.\n   Second, the Convention\u2019s drafting history supports this\ninterpretation. The first draft of the Vienna Convention\nwas written by the International Law Commission. Arti\ncle 36(2) of that draft required only that domestic laws\n\u201cnot nullify\u201d the rights afforded by the Convention. Draft\nArticles on Consular Relations Adopted by the Interna\ntional Law Commission at its Thirteenth Session, Art.\n36(2), reprinted in L. Lee, Vienna Convention on Consular\nRelations 237 (1966). A later amendment substituted the\n\u201cfull effect\u201d phrase over the strenuous objection of several\nnegotiating countries whose delegates argued that the\nphrase would \u201cmodify the criminal law and regulations or\nthe criminal procedure of the receiving state.\u201d 1 United\nNations Conference on Consular Relations, Official Re\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

The United Kingdom\nopposed that measure, explaining that it supported the\n\u201cfull effect\u201d version because the initial (\u201cnot nullify\u201d)\nversion\n     \u201cmeant that the laws and regulations of the receiving\n     State would govern the rights specified . . . provided\n     that they did not render those rights completely inop\n     erative\u2014for \u2018to nullify\u2019 meant to \u2018render completely\n     inoperative.\u2019 But rights could be seriously impaired\n     without becoming completely inoperative. . . . Consu\n     lar officials should, of course, comply with the laws\n     and regulations of the receiving State in such matters\n     as the times for visiting prisoners, but it was most\n     important that the substance of the rights and obliga\n     tions specified . . . should be preserved.\u201d Id., \u00b6\u00b66\u20137, at\n     40.\nNo one disagreed with the United Kingdom\u2019s understand\ning of the words \u201cfull effect.\u201d And with that understand\ning, the delegates voted down the Soviet Union\u2019s proposal\nto revert to the original language, and ultimately adopted\nthe provision with the words \u201cfull effect.\u201d Id., \u00b6109, at 87.\nAs so enacted, the provision reflects the \u201cessential princi\n18              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nple of international law . . . \u2018that reparation must, as far as\npossible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act\nand reestablish the situation which would, in all probabil\nity, have existed if that act had not been committed.\u2019 \u201d 2\nRestatement \u00a7901, at 343.\n   Third, the decisions of the ICJ, fairly read, interpret the\nConvention similarly. In LaGrand and Avena, the ICJ\nread the Convention as authorizing an individual foreign\nnational to raise an Article 36 violation at trial or in a\npostconviction proceeding. See Avena, 2004 I. C. J., \u00b6121;\nLaGrand, 2001 I. C. J., at 32\u201333, \u00b6125. The ICJ added\nthat the Convention requires member states to provide\n\u201ceffective\u201d remedies in their courts for Convention viola\ntions. See Avena, supra, \u00b6138. And the ICJ made two\ncritical statements in respect to procedural default rules.\nIn LaGrand, the court said that in \u201citself, the [procedural\ndefault] rule does not violate Article 36 of the Vienna\nConvention.\u201d 2001 I. C. J., at 22, \u00b690 (emphasis added).\nRather, the \u201cproblem arises when the procedural default\nrule does not allow the detained individual to challenge a\nconviction and sentence by claiming . . . that the compe\ntent national authorities failed to comply with their obli\ngation to provide the requisite consular information \u2018with\nout delay.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. And the ICJ later specified that the\nConvention forbids American States to apply a procedural\ndefault rule to bar assertion of a Convention violation\nclaim \u201cwhere it has been the failure of the United States [or\nof a State] itself to inform that may have precluded counsel\nfrom being in a position to have raised the question of a\nviolation of the Vienna Convention in the initial trial.\u201d\nAvena, 2004 I. C. J., \u00b6113 (emphasis added).\n   This last statement indicates that the ICJ understood\nthe Convention to prevent application of a procedural\ndefault rule only where the arresting authorities\u2019 failure to\ninform the foreign national of his Convention rights\nbrought about the procedural default in the first place.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           19\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nTaken together, the above statements make clear that the\nICJ read the Convention simply to require an effective\nremedy. It stated repeatedly that it did not dictate what\nthat remedy would be, as long it was offered as part of the\n\u201cjudicial process.\u201d Id., \u00b6140\u2013141. Hence, if the State\nprovides some other effective remedy, for example, review\nfor prejudice through a claim of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel, then the Convention would not forbid application\nof ordinary procedural default rules. See ABA Guidelines\nfor the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel\nin Death Penalty Cases 10.6 (Rev. ed. 2003) (discussing\ndefense counsel\u2019s obligation to seek consular assistance);\nValdez v. Oklahoma, 46 P. 3d 703, 710 (Okla. Crim. App.\n2002) (granting postconviction relief to a defendant who\nhad failed to raise a Vienna Convention violation at trial,\nbecause he showed that his lawyer \u201ccould have obtained\nfinancial, legal and investigative assistance from his\nconsulate\u201d that would have produced important new evi\ndence); see also Ledezma v. State, 626 N. W. 2d 134, 152\n(Iowa 2001) (concluding that \u201call criminal defense attor\nneys representing foreign nationals should be aware of the\nright to consular access as provided by Article 36, and\nshould advise their clients of this right\u201d because local\ncounsel \u201care not equipped to provide the same services as\nthe local consulate\u201d); cf. Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374\n(2005).\n   I will assume that the ICJ\u2019s interpretation does not bind\nthis Court in this case. Statute of the International Court\nof Justice, Art. 59, 59 Stat. 1062, T. S. No. 993 (1945) (ICJ\ndecisions have \u201cbinding force\u201d only \u201cbetween the parties\nand in respect of that particular case\u201d). But as the major\nity points out, the ICJ\u2019s decisions on this issue nonetheless\nwarrant our \u201c \u2018respectful consideration.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 21.\nThat \u201crespectful consideration\u201d reflects the understanding\nthat uniformity is an important goal of treaty interpreta\ntion. See Olympic Airways v. Husain, 540 U. S. 644, 660\n20             SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(2004) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (\u201c[I]t is reasonable to im\npute to the parties an intent that their respective courts\nstrive to interpret the treaty consistently\u201d). And the ICJ\u2019s\nposition as an international court specifically charged with\nthe duty to interpret numerous international treaties\n(including the Convention) provides a natural point of\nreference for national courts seeking that uniformity. See\nCounter-Memorial of the United States in Avena, 2004\nI. C. J. No. 128, p. 61, n. 128 (Nov. 3, 2003) (even if ICJ\ndecision binds only in particular case, \u201cit is well-settled\u201d\nthat an ICJ decision \u201cmay serve as authority beyond a\nparticular case\u201d; citing authorities); Ordonez & Reilly,\nEffect of the Jurisprudence of the International Court of\nJustice on National Courts, in International Law Deci\nsions in National Courts 335, 365 (T.

S. ____ (2006)           23\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nand history, but also with the ICJ\u2019s interpretation of the\nsame treaty provision. In creating this last-mentioned\nconflict, as far as I can tell, the Court\u2019s decision is un\nprecedented.\n   The Court supports its interpretation in three basic\nways. First, the majority says that \u201crespectful considera\ntion\u201d does not require us to agree with a decision that is\nclearly wrong. And, it says, the ICJ\u2019s decision is clearly\nwrong. The ICJ\u2019s interpretation of Article 36, the major\nity says, would permit a Convention violation claim to\n\u201ctrump not only procedural default rules, but any number\nof other rules requiring parties to present their legal\nclaims at the appropriate time for adjudication.\u201d Ante, at\n22. That interpretation, it adds, \u201coverlooks the impor\ntance of procedural default rules in an adversary system,\u201d\nand is \u201cinconsistent with the basic framework\u201d of that\n\u201csystem.\u201d Ante, at 21\u201322.\n   The majority\u2019s argument, however, overlooks what the\nICJ actually said, overstates what it actually meant, and\nis inconsistent with what it actually did. In Avena and\nLaGrand, the ICJ did not say that the Convention neces\nsarily trumps any, let alone all, procedural rules that\nwould otherwise bar assertion of a Convention violation\nclaim. Nor did it say that the Convention necessarily\ntrumps all procedural default rules. Rather, it said that\nthe Convention prohibits application of those rules to a\nConvention violation claim only \u201cwhere it has been the\nfailure of the United States [or of a State] itself to inform\nthat may have precluded counsel from being in a position\nto have raised the question of a violation of the Vienna\nConvention in the initial trial.\u201d Avena, 2004 I. C. J., \u00b6113\n(emphasis added). Thus, Article 36(2) precludes proce\ndural default only where the defendant\u2019s failure to bring\nhis claim sooner is the result of the underlying violation.\nSince procedural default rules themselves typically excuse\ndefaults where a defendant shows \u201ccause and prejudice,\u201d it\n24             SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nis difficult to see how this statement \u201coverlooks the impor\ntance of procedural default rules in an adversary system,\u201d\nor is \u201cinconsistent with the basic framework\u201d of that\n\u201csystem.\u201d\n   Moreover, Avena and LaGrand make clear what the\nICJ\u2019s language taken in context means: The Convention\nrequires effective national remedies; hence local proce\ndural rules must give way (to the Convention\u2019s \u201cfull effect\u201d\nrequirement) when, but only when, it is the failure of the\narresting authorities to inform the defendant of his Con\nvention rights that prevented the defendant from bringing\nhis claim sooner. The opinions nowhere suggest that a\nState must provide a procedural remedy to a defendant\nwho, for example, sleeps on his rights.\n   Consider, too, what the ICJ did in Avena, a case that\nclarified the court\u2019s earlier LaGrand opinion. It did not\nhold that American courts must ignore their procedural\ndefault rules in each of the 54 individual cases at issue.\nRather, it held that domestic courts must provide \u201creview\nand reconsideration\u201d in each case. Avena, 2004 I. C. J.,\n\u00b6153(9). It nowhere forbids a state court conducting such a\n\u201creview\u201d to bar claims not timely made provided that the\nviolation did not itself cause the delay. See id., \u00b6139.\n   Perhaps the ICJ\u2019s opinions are open to different inter\npretations. But how does reading those opinions as creat\ning an extreme rule of law, as reflecting a lack of under\nstanding of the \u201cadversary system,\u201d show \u201crespectful\nconsideration\u201d? To show that kind of respect, we must\nread the opinions in light of the Convention\u2019s underlying\nlanguage and purposes and ask whether, or to what ex\ntent, they require modification of a State\u2019s ordinary proce\ndural rules. See Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101 (laws and\nregulations \u201cmust enable full effect to be given to the\npurposes for which the rights accorded under this Article\nare intended\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   Nothing in Avena suggests, for example, that an ar\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           25\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrested foreign national who was already aware of his\nrights under Article 36, or who had a lawyer who was\naware of those rights, necessarily would be entitled to an\nexemption from the State\u2019s procedural default rules under\nArticle 36(2). Instead, as I have explained, see supra, at\n18\u201319, 23, Avena says only that Article 36(2) requires a\nstate court to excuse a procedural default rule where the\nState failed to inform the defendant of his consular access\nrights, and the defendant was not aware of those rights,\nand the State is unwilling to provide some other effective\nremedy, for example (if the lawyer acts incompetently in\nrespect to Convention rights of which the lawyer was\naware) an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. The\nCourt\u2019s reluctance to give LaGrand and Avena this per\nfectly reasonable interpretation reflects a failure to pro\nvide in practice the \u201crespectful consideration\u201d that we all\nbelieve the law demands.\n   The Court also relies on Breard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371\n(1998) (per curiam). In that case a foreign national, claim\ning a Convention violation, sought federal habeas corpus.\nThis Court upheld a denial of relief on the ground that the\nlower courts had correctly found that Breard procedurally\ndefaulted his Convention violation claim by failing to\ntimely raise it in his state-court proceedings. In reaching\nits conclusion, the Court rejected Breard\u2019s claim that the\nConvention trumped the procedural default rule. Its\nreasons were (1) that \u201cit has been recognized in interna\ntional law that, absent a clear and express statement to\nthe contrary, the procedural rules of the forum State\ngovern the implementation of the treaty in that State,\u201d id.,\nat 375; (2) that this principle is \u201cembodied in the Vienna\nConvention itself, which provides that the rights ex\npressed in the Convention \u2018shall be exercised in conformity\nwith the laws and regulations of the receiving State,\u2019 \u201d\nibid.; and (3) that the federal procedural default rule, as a\nlater-in-time federal statute, superseded any inconsistent\n26              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nprovision in the Convention, id., at 376.\n    I do not believe that Breard controls the outcome of\nthese cases. With respect to the third ground for the\nCourt\u2019s decision, Breard concerned a federal, rather than\n(as in Bustillo\u2019s case) a state, procedural default rule.\nThose different kinds of rules are treated differently under\nthe Supremacy Clause. See ibid. (applying the rule that\n\u201c \u2018an Act of Congress . . . is on a full parity with a treaty,\nand . . . when a statute which is subsequent in time is\ninconsistent with a treaty, the statute to the extent of\nconflict renders the treaty null\u2019 \u201d). Contrary to JUSTICE\nGINSBURG\u2019s view, then, ante, at 4, there is no anomaly in\ntreating state law differently from federal law for these\npurposes, if Congress chooses to enact legislation binding\nonly the federal government in respect to a matter covered\nby a treaty that binds both the federal government and\nthe States. Therefore, reading the Convention to require\nthe state courts to set aside Virginia\u2019s procedural default\nrule in Bustillo\u2019s case (assuming for argument\u2019s sake that\nhis case meets the criteria I have described, see supra, at\n15\u201316) would not call into question, let alone overrule,\n\u201cBreard\u2019s plain holding that the Convention does not\ntrump the [federal] procedural default doctrine,\u201d ante, at\n18, n. 4 (opinion of the Court), even if that ruling on its\nown terms is still good law after Avena and LaGrand.\n    Moreover, the ICJ decided Avena and LaGrand after\nthis Court decided Breard. And it is not difficult to recon\ncile those cases with Breard because they do not directly\nconflict with Breard\u2019s result. Rather, they interpret Arti\ncle 36(2) to require state procedural default rules some\ntimes to give way to the Convention, namely, when those\nrules prevent effective remedy by barring assertion of a\nclaim because of a delay caused by the Convention viola\ntion itself. I would read Breard as consistent with this\ninterpretation, i.e., as not saying that the Convention\nnever trumps any procedural default rule.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          27\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court complains that this treatment of Breard fails\nto give our own opinions \u201c \u2018respectful consideration.\u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 18, n. 4. In fact, our opinions are entitled to far\nmore than respectful consideration; they are entitled to\nfull stare decisis effect. But, as I have explained, reading\nBreard not to decide the outcome in this case would nei\nther overrule Breard\u2019s holding, nor reject outright its\nreading of the Convention. And, in any event, as a matter\nof the law of stare decisis, a modified reading of Breard is\nappropriate in light of the fact that the ICJ\u2019s later deci\nsions amount to a \u201csignificant . . . subsequent develop\nment\u201d of the law sufficient to lead to a reconsideration of\npast precedent. Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 236\n(1997); United States v. Percheman, 7 Pet. 51 (1833) (revis\niting prior treaty interpretation when new international\nlaw has come to light); see also Medell\u00edn, 544 U. S., at 689\n(O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting) (\u201cIn the past the Court has\nrevisited its interpretation of a treaty when new interna\ntional law has come to light\u201d (citing Percheman, supra, at\n89)). Indeed, the Court seems to recognize as much, in\nthat it spends a full six pages explaining why the ICJ\u2019s\ninterpretation of the Convention is incorrect, see ante, at\n18\u201324, rather than simply rejecting Bustillo\u2019s argument on\nthe ground that \u201c \u2018respectful consideration\u2019 of precedent\nshould begin at home.\u201d Ante, at 18, n. 4.\n   And there are other reasons not to place too much reli\nance on the breadth of Breard\u2019s language. Breard is a per\ncuriam decision that the Court had to reach within the few\nhours available between the time a petition for certiorari\nwas filed and a scheduled execution, the decision is fairly\nrecent, and the modification to which I refer requires no\nmore than reading an exception into Breard\u2019s language,\nlanguage that in any event was not central to the Court\u2019s\nholding.\n   The modification is appropriate too because the \u201cfull\neffect\u201d proviso in Article 36(2) provides a \u201cclear and ex\n28              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\npress statement\u201d that sometimes the Convention might\ntrump a domestic procedural rule. And in any event, it is\nnot even clear that such a clear statement rule actually\nexists. Breard\u2019s statement of a presumption that only a\ntreaty provision with a \u201cclear and express statement\u201d can\ntrump \u201cthe procedural rules of the forum State,\u201d 523 U. S.,\nat 375, is in tension with more fundamental interpretive\nrules in this area. See, e.g., Jordan v. Tashiro, 278 U. S.\n123, 127 (1928) (treaties must be construed liberally to\nprotect substantial rights); Asakura, 265 U. S., at 342\n(same); see also Vienna Convention on the Law of Trea\nties, opened for signature May 23, 1969, Art. 27, 1115\nU. N. T. S. 331, T. S. No. 58 (1980), 8 I. L. M. 679 (1969)\n(treaty parties may not invoke domestic law as an excuse\nfor failing to conform to their treaty obligations).\n   Indeed, the cases Breard cites for the proposition that a\nclear and express statement is required to trump a domes\ntic procedural rule seem not to establish it. Sun Oil Co. v.\nWortman, 486 U. S. 717, 723 (1988) (Court said only that\nit was a \u201crule in international law at the time the Consti\ntution was adopted\u201d that procedural rules \u201cmay be gov\nerned by forum law even when the substance of the claim\nmust be governed by another State\u2019s law\u201d; case involved\ndomestic law and the Constitution\u2019s Full Faith and Credit\nClause); Le Roy v.

But \u201c[a] treaty is in its\nnature a contract between two nations,\u201d Foster, 2 Pet., at\n314, and nations are of course free to agree to grant one\nanother\u2019s citizens protections that differ from the protec\ntions enjoyed by citizens at home, particularly when cir\ncumstances call for differential treatment. See infra, at\n30.\n   In sum, I find strong reasons for interpreting the Con\nvention as sometimes prohibiting a state court from apply\ning its ordinarily procedural default rule to a Convention\nviolation claim. The fact that the ICJ reached a similar\nconclusion in LaGrand and Avena adds strength to those\nreasons. And I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s argu\nments to the contrary.\n   Consequently, I would remand No. 05\u201351 so that Busti\nllo can argue to the Virginia state courts that they should\nmodify their ordinary procedural default requirements. I\nwould leave it to the state courts to determine in the first\ninstance whether state law has provided Bustillo the\neffective remedy that the Convention requires and how it\nhas done so (whether through \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d excep\ntions, ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims, or other\nways). Cf. LaGrand, 2001 I. C. J., at 33, \u00b6125 (the \u201cchoice\nof [implementing] means must be left to the United\nStates\u201d).\n                              IV\n  The final question presented asks whether a Convention\nviolation \u201cresult[s] in the suppression\u201d of the evidence, say\na confession, that a foreign national provided police before\nbeing informed of his Convention rights. Pet. for Cert. in\nNo. 04\u201310566, p. i. The majority answers in absolute\nterms, stating that \u201csuppression is not an appropriate\nremedy for a violation of the Convention.\u201d See ante, at 2.\nI agree with the majority insofar as it rejects the argu\n30             SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nment that the Convention creates a Miranda-style \u201cauto\nmatic exclusionary rule.\u201d Ante, at 8; see also Miranda,\n384 U. S., at 471; cf., e.g., Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643\n(1961); Franks v. Delaware, 438 U. S. 154 (1978). But I do\nnot agree with the absolute nature of its statement.\nRather, sometimes suppression could prove the only effec\ntive remedy. And, if that is so, then the Convention,\nwhich insists upon effective remedies, would require sup\npression in an appropriate case. Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at\n101.\n   Much depends upon the circumstances. It may be true\nthat in \u201cmost circumstances, there is likely to be little\nconnection between an Article 36 violation and evidence or\nstatements obtained by police.\u201d Ante, at 14. Miranda\nsurely helps, for it guarantees that police will inform an\narrested foreign national of his right to contact a lawyer.\nBut one cannot guarantee in advance that Miranda will\nadequately cure every seriously prejudicial failure to in\nform an arrested person of his right to contact his consular\npost. One can imagine a case, for example, involving a\nforeign national who speaks little English, who comes from\na country where confessions made to the police cannot be\nused in court as evidence, who does not understand that a\nstate-provided lawyer can provide him crucial assistance in\nan interrogation, and whose native community has great\nfear of police abuse. Indeed, Sanchez-Llamas made allega\ntions similar to these in his case. Brief for Petitioner San\nchez-Llamas 5-7; see also Brief for the Government of the\nUnited Mexican States as Amicus Curiae 10.\n   While JUSTICE GINSBURG is correct that a defendant\nwho is prejudiced under the Convention may be able to\nshow that his confession is involuntary under Miranda,\nante, at 2, I am not persuaded that this will always be so.\nA person who fully understands his Miranda rights but\ndoes not fully understand the implications of these rights\nfor our legal system may or may not be able to show that\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          31\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhis confession was involuntary under Miranda, but he will\ncertainly have a claim under the Vienna Convention. In\nsuch a case suppression of a confession may prove the only\neffective remedy. I would not rule out the existence of\nsuch cases in advance.\n  Furthermore, the majority is wrong to say that it would\n\u201cbe startling if the Convention were read to require sup\npression\u201d in such cases because suppression \u201cis an entirely\nAmerican legal creation.\u201d Ante, at 8 (opinion of the Court).\nI put to the side the fact that \u201csuppression\u201d is in origin a\nBritish, not an American, remedy. See Dickerson v.\nUnited States, 530 U. S. 428, 433 (2000) (noting that \u201cthe\nroots of the [Miranda] test developed in the common law\u201d\nand citing English cases); see also King v. Warickshall, 1\nLeach 262, 263\u2013264, 168 Eng. Rep. 234, 235 (K. B. 1783)\n(coerced confessions are inadmissible in British courts).\nRegardless, it is not \u201cstartling\u201d to read the Convention as\nsometimes requiring suppression. That is because those\nwho wrote the Convention were fully aware that the crimi\nnal justice systems of different nations differ in important\nways. They did not list particular remedies. They used\ngeneral language. That language requires every member\nnation to give \u201cfull effect\u201d to Article 36(1)\u2019s \u201cpurposes.\u201d\nArt. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. That language leaves it up\nto each nation to determine how to implement Article\n36(1)\u2019s requirements. Avena, 2004 I. C. J., \u00b6127; LaGrand,\nsupra, at 32\u201333, \u00b6125. But as a matter of logic and pur\npose that language must also insist upon the use of sup\npression if and when there are circumstances in which\nsuppression provides the only effective remedy.\n  These differences may also help to explain what the\nmajority says is the disturbing circumstance that \u201cnearly\nall\u201d other signatories to the Convention \u201crefuse to recog\nnize\u201d suppression \u201cas a matter of domestic law,\u201d and there\nfore that \u201cSanchez-Llamas would [not] be afforded the\nrelief he seeks here in any of the other 169 countries party\n32             SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nto the Vienna Convention.\u201d Ante, at 9. In fact, there are\nseveral cases from common-law jurisdictions suggesting\nthat suppression is an appropriate remedy for a Conven\ntion violation. See, e.g., Tan Seng Kiah v. Queen (2001)\n160 F. L. R. 26 (Ct. Crim. App. N. Terr.) (Australian case\nsuppressing confession obtained in violation of statute\nrequiring police to notify defendant of right to contact\nconsulate upon arrest); Queen v. Tan [2001] W. A. S. C.\n275 (Sup. Ct. W. Australia in Crim.) (Australian case\nconsidering but declining to suppress evidence based on\nviolation of same statute); Regina v. Partak, 160 C. C. C.\n3d, at \u00b663 (Canada) (concluding that suppression is inap\npropriate, not because it was never a proper remedy under\nthe Vienna Convention but because the defendant \u201ccom\npletely failed to demonstrate any prejudice arising from\nthe failure of the police to notify him of his consular\nrights\u201d).\n   I concede the absence of such cases from civil law juris\ndictions. But the criminal justice systems in those nations\ndiffer from our own in significant ways. Civil-law nations,\nfor example, typically rely more heavily than do we upon\njudicial investigation, questioning by a neutral magistrate,\nthe compiling of all evidence into a dossier, and later\nreview of that dossier at trial by judges who may sit with\nout our type of jury. In such a system, formal suppression\nproceedings may prove less frequent. Judges, as a matter\nof practice, may simply disregard improperly obtained\nevidence, they may discount the significance of that evi\ndence, or they may adjust the nature of future proceedings\nor even the final sentence accordingly. See Dama\u0161ka,\nEvidentiary Barriers to Conviction and Two Models of\nCriminal Procedure: A Comparative Study, 121 U. Pa.\nL. Rev. 506, 522 (1972) (explaining why many civil law\nsystem \u201cprovisions regulating the interrogation of defen\ndants are silent as to the admissibility of testimony ob\ntained in violation of proper interrogation procedures\u201d);\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

The\nexistence of cases in such nations where a court denies a\ndefense request to suppress, of course, might well shed\nlight on that nation\u2019s readiness to provide an effective\nremedy. The Solicitor General cites one (and only one)\nsuch case.

OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsomehow the petitioners here are asking the United States\nto provide that which other countries deny, an effective\nremedy.\n                               V\n   The United States joined the Vienna Convention, and\nurged other nations to join, in order to promote \u201cthe or\nderly and effective conduct of consular relations between\nStates,\u201d and to guarantee \u201cthe protection of our citizens\nabroad.\u201d Vienna Convention on Consular Relations with\nOptional Protocol, S. Exec. Doc. No. E, 91st Cong., 1st\nSess., 60, 75 (1969). In doing so, the United States, along\nwith the other 169 nations that ratified the Convention,\nundertook a complex task. They sought not only to protect\ntheir consular posts, but also to assure that their nationals\nwould have access to those posts when arrested abroad.\nBut how to enforce those rights poses a difficult question\nbecause the enforcement mechanism inevitably will vary\ndepending upon the details of a nation\u2019s legal system. For\npractical, legal, and political, reasons, it is difficult to\nwrite enforcement details into an international treaty.\nYet without any such guarantees it may prove difficult to\nprevent an individual nation, through application of its\nsystem\u2019s details, from denying in practice the rights that\nthe treaty sought to assure.\n   The Convention deals with this problem by including a\ngeneral provision that both severely limits the treaty\u2019s\nintrusion into the functioning of a domestic legal system\nand also safeguards consular access rights from serious\ndomestic neglect. It does so by stating that those rights\nshall \u201cbe exercised in conformity with the laws and regula\ntions of the receiving State,\u201d provided that those laws and\nregulations give \u201cfull effect\u201d to Article 36(1)\u2019s purposes.\nArt. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101.\n   Applying this provision to our own legal system, I would\nseek to minimize the Convention\u2019s intrusion and federal\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

That is why I believe that the Convention here\nrequires individual States to make an exception (akin to a\n\u201ccause and prejudice\u201d exception) to a state procedural\ndefault rule if (1) the defendant\u2019s failure to raise a claim of\na Convention violation in a timely manner itself was a\nproduct of that violation, and (2) state law provides no\nother procedural means through which the State\u2019s courts\ncan provide \u201creview,\u201d \u201creconsideration,\u201d and effective\nrelief. Similarly, I would hold that whether the Conven\ntion requires a state court to suppress a confession ob\ntained after an Article 36 violation depends on whether\nsuppression is the only remedy available that will effec\ntively cure related prejudice. And because neither state\ncourt applied this standard below, I would remand each\ncase for that initial consideration. See 338 Ore., at 269,\n108 P. 3d, at 574 (rejecting Sanchez-Llamas\u2019 request for\nsuppression remedy solely on the ground that the Conven\ntion \u201cdoes not create rights that individual foreign nation\nals may assert in a criminal proceeding\u201d); App. to Pet. for\nCert. 47a (rejecting Bustillo\u2019s request for state postconvic\ntion relief based on a standard different from that set forth\nhere).\n   The interpretation of the Convention that I would adopt\nis consistent with the ICJ\u2019s own interpretation and should\nnot impose significant new burdens upon state criminal\njustice systems. America\u2019s legal traditions have long\nincluded detailed rules for discovering and curing prejudi\ncial legal errors. Indeed, many States already have \u201ccause\nand prejudice\u201d exceptions likely broad enough to provide\nthe \u201ceffective\u201d relief the Convention demands. And, in any\nevent, it leaves the States free to apply their own judicial\nremedies in light of, and bounded by, the Convention\u2019s\ngeneral instructions.\n   The Court, I fear, does not rise to the interpretive chal\n36              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlenge. Rather than seek to apply Article 36\u2019s language\nand purposes to the federal/state relationships that char\nacterize America\u2019s legal system, it simply rejects the no\ntion that Article 36(2) sets forth any relevant requirement.\nThat approach leaves States free to deny effective relief for\nConvention violations, despite America\u2019s promise to pro\nvide just such relief. That approach risks weakening\nrespect abroad for the rights of foreign nationals, a respect\nthat America, in 1969, sought to make effective through\nout the world. And it increases the difficulties faced by\nthe United States and other nations who would, through\nbinding treaties, strengthen the role that law can play in\nassuring all citizens, including American citizens, fair\ntreatment throughout the world.\n   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n",

Argued March 29, 2006\u2014Decided June 28, 2006*\nArticle 36(1)(b) of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations pro\n  vides that if a person detained by a foreign country \u201cso requests, the\n  competent authorities of the receiving State shall, without delay, in\n  form the consular post of the sending State\u201d of such detention, and\n  \u201cinform the [detainee] of his rights under this sub-paragraph.\u201d Arti\n  cle 36(2) specifies: \u201cThe rights referred to in paragraph 1 . . . shall be\n  exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving\n  State, subject to the proviso . . . that the said laws . . . must enable\n  full effect to be given to the purposes for which the rights accorded\n  under this Article are intended.\u201d Along with the Convention, the\n  United States ratified the Optional Protocol Concerning the Compul\n  sory Settlement of Disputes, which provides: \u201cDisputes arising out of\n  the . . . Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdiction of the\n  International Court of Justice [(ICJ)].\u201d The United States withdrew\n  from the Protocol on March 7, 2005.\n     Petitioner in No. 04\u201310566, Moises Sanchez-Llamas, is a Mexican\n  national. When he was arrested after an exchange of gunfire with\n  police, officers did not inform him that he could ask to have the Mexi\n  can Consulate notified of his detention. During interrogation, he\n  made incriminating statements regarding the shootout. Before his\n  trial for attempted murder and other offenses, Sanchez-Llamas\n  moved to suppress those statements on the ground, inter alia, that\n  the authorities had failed to comply with Article 36. The state court\n  denied that motion and Sanchez-Llamas was convicted and sentenced\n  to prison, and the Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed. The State Su\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 05\u201351, Bustillo v. Johnson, Director, Virginia\nDepartment of Corrections, on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Vir\nginia.\n2                    SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    preme Court also affirmed, concluding that Article 36 does not create\n    rights to consular access or notification that a detained individual\n    can enforce in a judicial proceeding.\n       Petitioner in No. 05\u201351, Mario Bustillo, a Honduran national, was\n    arrested and charged with murder, but police never informed him\n    that he could request that the Honduran Consulate be notified of his\n    detention. He was convicted and sentenced to prison, and his convic\n    tion and sentence were affirmed on appeal. He then filed a habeas\n    petition in state court arguing, for the first time, that authorities had\n    violated his right to consular notification under Article 36. The court\n    dismissed that claim as procedurally barred because he had failed to\n    raise it at trial or on appeal. The Virginia Supreme Court found no\n    reversible error.\nHeld: Even assuming without deciding that the Convention creates\n judicially enforceable rights, suppression is not an appropriate rem\n edy for a violation, and a State may apply its regular procedural de\n fault rules to Convention claims. Pp. 7\u201325.\n     (a) Because petitioners are not in any event entitled to relief, the\n Court need not resolve whether the Convention grants individuals\n enforceable rights, but assumes, without deciding, that Article 36\n does so. Pp. 7\u20138.\n     (b) Neither the Convention itself nor this Court\u2019s precedents apply\n ing the exclusionary rule support suppression of a defendant\u2019s state\n ments to police as a remedy for an Article 36 violation.\n     The Convention does not mandate suppression or any other specific\n remedy, but expressly leaves Article 36\u2019s implementation to domestic\n law: Article 36 rights must \u201cbe exercised in conformity with the laws\n . . . of the receiving State.\u201d Art. 36(2). Sanchez-Llamas\u2019 argument\n that suppression is appropriate under United States law and should\n be required under the Court\u2019s authority to develop remedies for the\n enforcement of federal law in state-court criminal proceedings is re\n jected. \u201cIt is beyond dispute that [this Court does] not hold a super\n visory power over the [state] courts.\u201d Dickerson v. United States, 530\n U. S. 428, 438. The exclusionary rule cases on which Sanchez-Llamas\n principally relies are inapplicable because they rest on the Court\u2019s\n supervisory authority over federal courts.\n     The Court\u2019s authority to create a judicial remedy applicable in\n state court must therefore lie, if anywhere, in the treaty itself.\n Where a treaty provides for a particular judicial remedy, courts must\n apply it as a requirement of federal law. Cf., e.g., United States v.\n Giordano, 416 U. S. 505, 524\u2013525. But where a treaty does not pro\n vide a particular remedy, either expressly or implicitly, it is not for\n the federal courts to impose one on the States through lawmaking of\n their own. Even if the \u201cfull effect\u201d language of Article 36(2) implicitly\n                   Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nrequires a judicial remedy, as Sanchez-Llamas claims, that Article\nequally requires that Article 36(1) rights be exercised in conformity\nwith domestic law. Under domestic law, the exclusionary rule is not\na remedy this Court applies lightly. It has been used primarily to de\nter certain Fourth and Fifth Amendment violations, including, e.g.,\nunconstitutional searches and seizures, Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643,\n655\u2013657, and confessions exacted in violation of the right against\ncompelled self-incrimination or due process, Dickerson, supra, at 435.\nIn contrast, Article 36 has nothing to do with searches or interroga\ntions and, indeed, does not guarantee defendants any assistance at\nall. It secures for foreign nationals only the right to have their consu\nlate informed of their arrest or detention\u2014not to have their consulate\nintervene, or to have police cease their investigation pending any\nsuch notice or intervention. Moreover, the failure to inform a defen\ndant of his Article 36 rights is unlikely, with any frequency, to pro\nduce unreliable confessions, see Watkins v. Sowders, 449 U. S. 341,\n347, or to give the police any practical advantage in obtaining in\ncriminating evidence, see Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206, 217.\nSuppression would also be a vastly disproportionate remedy for an\nArticle 36 violation. The interests Sanchez-Llamas claims Article 36\nadvances are effectively protected by other constitutional and statu\ntory requirements, including the right to an attorney and to protec\ntion against compelled self-incrimination. Finally, suppression is not\nthe only means of vindicating Article 36 rights. For example, diplo\nmatic avenues\u2014the primary means of enforcing the Vienna Conven\ntion\u2014remain open. Pp. 8\u201315.\n   (c) States may subject Article 36 claims to the same procedural de\nfault rules that apply generally to other federal-law claims.\n   This question is controlled by the Court\u2019s holding in Breard v.\nGreene, 523 U. S. 371, 375, that the petitioner\u2019s failure to raise an Ar\nticle 36 claim in state court prevented him from having the claim\nheard in a subsequent federal habeas proceeding. Bustillo\u2019s two rea\nsons why Breard does not control are rejected.\n   First, he argues that Breard\u2019s procedural default holding was un\nnecessary to the result because the petitioner there could not demon\nstrate prejudice from the default and because, in any event, the later\nenacted Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 su\nperseded any right the petitioner had under the Vienna Convention\nto have his claim heard on collateral review. Resolution of the proce\ndural default question, however, was the principal reason for denying\nthe Breard petitioner\u2019s claim, and the discussion of the issue occupied\nthe bulk of the Court\u2019s reasoning. See 523 U. S., at 375\u2013377. It is no\nanswer to argue that the procedural default holding was unnecessary\nsimply because the petitioner had several other ways to lose.\n4                     SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n       Second, Bustillo asserts that since Breard, the ICJ\u2019s LaGrand and\n    Avena decisions have interpreted the Convention to preclude the ap\n    plication of procedural default rules to Article 36 claims. Although\n    the ICJ\u2019s interpretation deserves \u201crespectful consideration,\u201d Breard,\n    supra, at 375, it does not compel the Court to reconsider Breard\u2019s un\n    derstanding of the Convention. \u201cThe judicial Power of the United\n    States\u201d is \u201cvested in one supreme Court . . . and . . . inferior courts.\u201d\n    U. S. Const., Art. III, \u00a71. That \u201cpower . . . extend[s] to . . . treaties,\u201d\n    Art. III, \u00a72, and includes the duty \u201cto say what the law is,\u201d Marbury\n    v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177. If treaties are to be given effect as\n    federal law, determining their meaning as a matter of federal law \u201cis\n    emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department,\u201d\n    headed by the \u201cone supreme Court.\u201d Ibid. Nothing in the ICJ\u2019s\n    structure or purpose suggests that its interpretations were intended\n    to be binding on U. S. courts. Even according \u201crespectful considera\n    tion,\u201d the ICJ\u2019s interpretation cannot overcome the plain import of\n    Article 36(2), which states that the rights it implements \u201cshall be ex\n    ercised in conformity with the laws . . . of the receiving State.\u201d In the\n    United States, this means that the rule of procedural default\u2014which\n    applies even to claimed violations of our own Constitution, see Engle\n    v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 129\u2014applies also to Vienna Convention\n    claims. Bustillo points to nothing in the drafting history of Article 36\n    or in the contemporary practice of other Convention signatories that\n    undermines this conclusion. LaGrand\u2019s conclusion that applying the\n    procedural default rule denies \u201cfull effect\u201d to the purposes of Article\n    36, by preventing courts from attaching legal significance to an Arti\n    cle 36 violation, is inconsistent with the basic framework of an adver\n    sary system. Such a system relies chiefly on the parties to raise sig\n    nificant issues and present them to the courts in the appropriate\n    manner at the appropriate time for adjudication. See Castro v.\n    United States, 540 U. S. 375, 386. Procedural default rules generally\n    take on greater importance in an adversary system than in the sort of\n    magistrate-directed, inquisitorial legal system characteristic of many\n    of the other Convention signatories. Under the ICJ\u2019s reading of \u201cfull\n    effect,\u201d Article 36 claims could trump not only procedural default\n    rules, but any number of other rules requiring parties to present\n    their legal claims at the appropriate time for adjudication, such as\n    statutes of limitations and prohibitions against filing successive ha\n    beas petitions. This sweeps too broadly, for it reads the \u201cfull effect\u201d\n    proviso in a way that leaves little room for the clear instruction in\n    Article 36(2) that Article 36 rights \u201cbe exercised in conformity with\n    the laws . . . of the receiving State.\u201d A comparison with a suspect\u2019s\n    rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, disposes of Bustillo\u2019s\n    \u201cfull effect\u201d claim. Although the failure to inform defendants of their\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                    5\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  right to consular notification may prevent them from becoming aware\n  of their Article 36 rights and asserting them at trial, precisely the\n  same thing is true of Miranda rights. Nevertheless, if a defendant\n  fails to raise his Miranda claim at trial, procedural default rules may\n  bar him from raising the claim in a subsequent postconviction pro\n  ceeding. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 87. Bustillo\u2019s attempt to\n  analogize an Article 36 claim to a claim under Brady v. Maryland,\n  373 U. S. 83, that the prosecution failed to disclose exculpatory evi\n  dence is inapt. Finally, his argument that Article 36 claims are most\n  appropriately raised post-trial or on collateral review under Massaro\n  v. United States, 538 U. S. 500, is rejected. See Dickerson, supra, at\n  438. Pp. 15\u201325.\n     (d) The Court\u2019s holding in no way disparages the Convention\u2019s im\n  portance. It is no slight to the Convention to deny petitioners\u2019 claims\n  under the same principles this Court would apply to claims under an\n  Act of Congress or the Constitution itself.

These consolidated cases\nconcern the availability of judicial relief for violations of\nArticle 36. We are confronted with three questions. First,\ndoes Article 36 create rights that defendants may invoke\nagainst the detaining authorities in a criminal trial or in a\npostconviction proceeding? Second, does a violation of\nArticle 36 require suppression of a defendant\u2019s statements\n2                  SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto police? Third, may a State, in a postconviction proceed\ning, treat a defendant\u2019s Article 36 claim as defaulted\nbecause he failed to raise the claim at trial? We conclude,\neven assuming the Convention creates judicially enforce\nable rights, that suppression is not an appropriate remedy\nfor a violation of Article 36, and that a State may apply its\nregular rules of procedural default to Article 36 claims.\nWe therefore affirm the decisions below.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   The Vienna Convention was drafted in 1963 with the\npurpose, evident in its preamble, of \u201ccontribut[ing] to the\ndevelopment of friendly relations among nations, irrespec\ntive of their differing constitutional and social systems.\u201d\n21 U. S. T., at 79. The Convention consists of 79 articles\nregulating various aspects of consular activities. At pre\nsent, 170 countries are party to the Convention. The\nUnited States, upon the advice and consent of the Senate,\nratified the Convention in 1969. Id., at 77.\n   Article 36 of the Convention concerns consular officers\u2019\naccess to their nationals detained by authorities in a\nforeign country. The article provides that \u201cif he so re\nquests, the competent authorities of the receiving State\nshall, without delay, inform the consular post of the send\ning State if, within its consular district, a national of that\nState is arrested or committed to prison or to custody\npending trial or is detained in any other manner.\u201d Art.\n36(1)(b), id., at 101.1 In other words, when a national of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 In\n       its entirety, Article 36 of the Vienna Convention states:\n  \u201c1. With a view to facilitating the exercise of consular functions\nrelating to nationals of the sending State:\n  \u201c(a) consular officers shall be free to communicate with nationals of\nthe sending State and to have access to them. Nationals of the sending\nState shall have the same freedom with respect to communication with\nand access to consular officers of the sending State;\n  \u201c(b) if he so requests, the competent authorities of the receiving State\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

Article\n36(1)(b) further states that \u201c[t]he said authorities shall\ninform the person concerned [i.e., the detainee] without\ndelay of his rights under this sub-paragraph.\u201d Ibid. The\nConvention also provides guidance regarding how these\nrequirements, and the other requirements of Article 36,\nare to be implemented:\n     \u201cThe rights referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article\n     shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and\n     regulations of the receiving State, subject to the pro\n     viso, however, that the said laws and regulations\n     must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for\n     which the rights accorded under this Article are in\n     tended.\u201d Art. 36(2), ibid.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nshall, without delay, inform the consular post of the sending State if,\nwithin its consular district, a national of that State is arrested or\ncommitted to prison or to custody pending trial or is detained in any\nother manner. Any communication addressed to the consular post by\nthe person arrested, in prison, custody or detention shall also be for\nwarded by the said authorities without delay. The said authorities\nshall inform the person concerned without delay of his rights under this\nsub-paragraph;\n   \u201c(c) consular officers shall have the right to visit a national of the\nsending State who is in prison, custody or detention, to converse and\ncorrespond with him and to arrange for his legal representation. They\nshall also have the right to visit any national of the sending State who\nis in prison, custody or detention in their district in pursuance of a\njudgment. Nevertheless, consular officers shall refrain from taking\naction on behalf of a national who is in prison, custody or detention if\nhe expressly opposes such action.\n   \u201c2. The rights referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be\nexercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving\nState, subject to the proviso, however, that the said laws and regula\ntions must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for which the\nrights accorded under this Article are intended.\u201d 21 U.

In December 1999, he was involved in an exchange\nof gunfire with police in which one officer suffered a gun\nshot wound in the leg. Police arrested Sanchez-Llamas\nand gave him warnings under Miranda v. Arizona, 384\nU. S. 436 (1966), in both English and Spanish. At no time,\nhowever, did they inform him that he could ask to have\nthe Mexican Consulate notified of his detention.\n   Shortly after the arrest and Miranda warnings, police\ninterrogated Sanchez-Llamas with the assistance of an\ninterpreter. In the course of the interrogation, Sanchez-\nLlamas made several incriminating statements regarding\nthe shootout with police. He was charged with attempted\naggravated murder, attempted murder, and several other\noffenses. Before trial, Sanchez-Llamas moved to suppress\nthe statements he made to police. He argued that sup\npression was warranted because the statements were\nmade involuntarily and because the authorities had failed\nto comply with Article 36 of the Vienna Convention. The\ntrial court denied the motion. The case proceeded to trial,\nand Sanchez-Llamas was convicted and sentenced to 201\u20442\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

That eve\nning, outside the restaurant, James Merry was struck in\nthe head with a baseball bat as he stood smoking a ciga\nrette. He died several days later. Several witnesses at the\nscene identified Bustillo as the assailant. Police arrested\nBustillo the morning after the attack and eventually\ncharged him with murder. Authorities never informed\nhim that he could request to have the Honduran Consu\nlate notified of his detention.\n  At trial, the defense pursued a theory that another man,\nknown as \u201cSirena,\u201d was responsible for the attack. Two\ndefense witnesses testified that Bustillo was not the killer.\nOne of the witnesses specifically identified the attacker as\nSirena. In addition, a third defense witness stated that\nshe had seen Sirena on a flight to Honduras the day after\nthe victim died. In its closing argument before the jury,\nthe prosecution dismissed the defense theory about Si\nrena. See App. in No. 05\u201351, p. 21 (\u201cThis whole Sirena\nthing, I don\u2019t want to dwell on it too much. It\u2019s very con\nvenient that Mr. Sirena apparently isn\u2019t available\u201d). A\njury convicted Bustillo of first-degree murder, and he was\nsentenced to 30 years in prison. His conviction and sen\n6                  SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntence were affirmed on appeal.\n   After his conviction became final, Bustillo filed a peti\ntion for a writ of habeas corpus in state court. There, for\nthe first time, he argued that authorities had violated his\nright to consular notification under Article 36 of the Vi\nenna Convention. He claimed that if he had been advised\nof his right to confer with the Honduran Consulate, he\n\u201cwould have done so without delay.\u201d App. in No. 05\u201351,\np. 60. Moreover, the Honduran Consulate executed an\naffidavit stating that \u201cit would have endeavoured to help\nMr. Bustillo in his defense\u201d had it learned of his detention\nprior to trial. Id., at 74. Bustillo insisted that the consu\nlate could have helped him locate Sirena prior to trial. His\nhabeas petition also argued, as part of a claim of ineffective\nassistance of counsel, that his attorney should have advised\nhim of his right to notify the Honduran Consulate of his\narrest and detention.2\n   The state habeas court dismissed Bustillo\u2019s Vienna\nConvention claim as \u201cprocedurally barred\u201d because he had\nfailed to raise the issue at trial or on appeal. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. in No. 05\u201351, p. 43a. The court also denied Bust\nillo\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, ruling that\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Bustillo\u2019s habeas petition also presented newly acquired evidence\n\nthat tended to cast doubt on his conviction. Most notably, he produced\na secretly recorded videotape in which Sirena admitted killing Merry\nand stated that Bustillo had been wrongly convicted. App. in No. 05\u2013\n51, pp. 38, 54. In addition, Bustillo argued that the prosecution vio\nlated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), by failing to disclose that\non the night of the crime, police had questioned a man named \u201cJulio C.\nOsorto,\u201d who is now known to be the same man as \u201cSirena.\u201d The police\nreport concerning the encounter stated that Sirena appeared to have\nketchup on his pants. Bustillo contends that these stains might in fact\nhave been the victim\u2019s blood. The Commonwealth disputes this. The\nstate habeas court found \u201cno evidence of any transfer of the victim\u2019s\nblood to the assailant,\u201d and concluded that the undisclosed encounter\nbetween police and Sirena was not material under Brady.

Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). App. in No.\n05\u201351, p. 132. In an order refusing Bustillo\u2019s petition for\nappeal, the Supreme Court of Virginia found \u201cno reversi\nble error\u201d in the habeas court\u2019s dismissal of the Vienna\nConvention claim.

S. ___ (2005).\n                               II\n   We granted certiorari as to three questions presented in\nthese cases: (1) whether Article 36 of the Vienna Conven\ntion grants rights that may be invoked by individuals in a\njudicial proceeding; (2) whether suppression of evidence is\na proper remedy for a violation of Article 36; and (3)\nwhether an Article 36 claim may be deemed forfeited\nunder state procedural rules because a defendant failed to\nraise the claim at trial.\n   As a predicate to their claims for relief, Sanchez-Llamas\nand Bustillo each argue that Article 36 grants them an\nindividually enforceable right to request that their consu\nlar officers be notified of their detention, and an accompa\nnying right to be informed by authorities of the availabil\nity of consular notification. Respondents and the United\nStates, as amicus curiae, strongly dispute this contention.\nThey argue that \u201cthere is a presumption that a treaty will\nbe enforced through political and diplomatic channels,\nrather than through the courts.\u201d Brief for United States 11;\nibid. (quoting Head Money Cases, 112 U.

Because we conclude that\nSanchez-Llamas and Bustillo are not in any event entitled\n8               SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v.

Therefore, for purposes of\naddressing petitioners\u2019 claims, we assume, without decid\ning, that Article 36 does grant Bustillo and Sanchez-\nLlamas such rights.\n                               A\n   Sanchez-Llamas argues that the trial court was re\nquired to suppress his statements to police because au\nthorities never told him of his rights under Article 36. He\nrefrains, however, from arguing that the Vienna Conven\ntion itself mandates suppression. We think this a wise\nconcession. The Convention does not prescribe specific\nremedies for violations of Article 36. Rather, it expressly\nleaves the implementation of Article 36 to domestic law:\nRights under Article 36 are to \u201cbe exercised in conformity\nwith the laws and regulations of the receiving State.\u201d Art.\n36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. As far as the text of the Conven\ntion is concerned, the question of the availability of the\nexclusionary rule for Article 36 violations is a matter of\ndomestic law.\n   It would be startling if the Convention were read to\nrequire suppression. The exclusionary rule as we know it\nis an entirely American legal creation. See Bivens v. Six\nUnknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, 415 (1971)\n(Burger, C. J., dissenting) (the exclusionary rule \u201cis unique\nto American jurisprudence\u201d).

They argue that\nour cases suppressing evidence obtained in violation of\nfederal statutes are grounded in our supervisory authority\nover the federal courts\u2014an authority that does not extend\nto state-court proceedings. Brief for Respondent in No.\n04\u201310566, pp. 42\u201343; Brief for United States 32\u201334; see\nMcNabb v. United States, 318 U.

Unless required to do so by the Convention itself,\nthey argue, we cannot direct Oregon courts to exclude\nSanchez-Llamas\u2019 statements from his criminal trial.\n  To the extent Sanchez-Llamas argues that we should\ninvoke our supervisory authority, the law is clear: \u201cIt is\nbeyond dispute that we do not hold a supervisory power\nover the courts of the several States.\u201d Dickerson v.

The cases on which Sanchez-Llamas principally\nrelies are inapplicable in light of the limited reach of our\nsupervisory powers. Mallory and McNabb plainly rest on\nour supervisory authority.        Mallory, supra, at 453;\nMcNabb, supra, at 340. And while Miller is not clear\nabout its authority for requiring suppression, we have\nunderstood it to have a similar basis. See Ker v.

II, \u00a72, cl. 2. The United States ratified the\nConvention with the expectation that it would be inter\npreted according to its terms. See Restatement (Third) of\nForeign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7325(1) (1986)\n(\u201cAn international agreement is to be interpreted in good\nfaith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to\nits terms in their context and in the light of its object and\npurpose\u201d). If we were to require suppression for Article 36\nviolations without some authority in the Convention, we\nwould in effect be supplementing those terms by enlarging\nthe obligations of the United States under the Convention.\nThis is entirely inconsistent with the judicial function. Cf.\nThe Amiable Isabella, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71 (1821) (Story, J.) (\u201c[T]o\nalter, amend, or add to any treaty, by inserting any clause,\nwhether small or great, important or trivial, would be on our\npart an usurpation of power, and not an exercise of judicial\nfunctions. It would be to make, and not to construe a\ntreaty\u201d).\n   Of course, it is well established that a self-executing\ntreaty binds the States pursuant to the Supremacy Clause,\nand that the States therefore must recognize the force of the\ntreaty in the course of adjudicating the rights of litigants.\nSee, e.g., Hauenstein v. Lynham, 100 U. S. 483 (1880). And\nwhere a treaty provides for a particular judicial remedy,\nthere is no issue of intruding on the constitutional pre\nrogatives of the States or the other federal branches.\nCourts must apply the remedy as a requirement of federal\nlaw. Cf. 18 U. S. C. \u00a72515; United States v. Giordano, 416\nU. S. 505, 524\u2013525 (1974). But where a treaty does not\nprovide a particular remedy, either expressly or implicitly, it\nis not for the federal courts to impose one on the States\n12              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthrough lawmaking of their own.\n   Sanchez-Llamas argues that the language of the Con\nvention implicitly requires a judicial remedy because it\nstates that the laws and regulations governing the exer\ncise of Article 36 rights \u201cmust enable full effect to be given\nto the purposes for which the rights . . . are intended,\u201d Art.\n36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101 (emphasis added). In his view,\nalthough \u201cfull effect\u201d may not automatically require an\nexclusionary rule, it does require an appropriate judicial\nremedy of some kind. There is reason to doubt this inter\npretation. In particular, there is little indication that\nother parties to the Convention have interpreted Article\n36 to require a judicial remedy in the context of criminal\nprosecutions. See Department of State Answers to Ques\ntions Posed by the First Circuit in United States v. Nai\nFook Li, No. 97\u20132034 etc., p. A\u20139 (Oct. 15, 1999) (\u201cWe are\nunaware of any country party to the [Vienna Convention]\nthat provides remedies for violations of consular notifica\ntion through its domestic criminal justice system\u201d).\n   Nevertheless, even if Sanchez-Llamas is correct that\nArticle 36 implicitly requires a judicial remedy, the Con\nvention equally states that Article 36 rights \u201cshall be\nexercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of\nthe receiving State.\u201d Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. Under\nour domestic law, the exclusionary rule is not a remedy we\napply lightly. \u201c[O]ur cases have repeatedly emphasized\nthat the rule\u2019s \u2018costly toll\u2019 upon truth-seeking and law\nenforcement objectives presents a high obstacle for those\nurging application of the rule.\u201d Pennsylvania Bd. of Proba\ntion and Parole v. Scott, 524 U. S. 357, 364\u2013365 (1998).\nBecause the rule\u2019s social costs are considerable, suppres\nsion is warranted only where the rule\u2019s \u201c \u2018remedial objec\ntives are thought most efficaciously served.\u2019 \u201d United\nStates v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 908 (1984) (quoting United\nStates v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 348 (1974)).\n   We have applied the exclusionary rule primarily to deter\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)             13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nconstitutional violations. In particular, we have ruled that\nthe Constitution requires the exclusion of evidence ob\ntained by certain violations of the Fourth Amendment, see\nTaylor v. Alabama, 457 U. S. 687, 694 (1982) (arrests in\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment); Mapp v. Ohio, 367\nU. S. 643, 655\u2013657 (1961) (unconstitutional searches and\nseizures), and confessions exacted by police in violation of\nthe right against compelled self-incrimination or due proc\ness, see Dickerson, 530 U. S., at 435 (failure to give Miranda\nwarnings); Payne v. Arkansas, 356 U. S. 560, 568 (1958)\n(involuntary confessions).\n   The few cases in which we have suppressed evidence for\nstatutory violations do not help Sanchez-Llamas. In those\ncases, the excluded evidence arose directly out of statutory\nviolations that implicated important Fourth and Fifth\nAmendment interests. McNabb, for example, involved the\nsuppression of incriminating statements obtained during a\nprolonged detention of the defendants, in violation of a\nstatute requiring persons arrested without a warrant to be\npromptly presented to a judicial officer. We noted that the\nstatutory right was intended to \u201cavoid all the evil implica\ntions of secret interrogation of persons accused of crime,\u201d\n318 U. S., at 344, and later stated that McNabb was \u201cre\nsponsive to the same considerations of Fifth Amendment\npolicy that . . . face[d] us . . . as to the states\u201d in Miranda,\n384 U. S., at 463. Similarly, in Miller, we required sup\npression of evidence that was the product of a search\nincident to an unlawful arrest. 357 U. S., at 305; see\nCalifornia v. Hodari D., 499 U. S. 621, 624 (1991) (\u201cWe have\nlong understood that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection\nagainst \u2018unreasonable . . . seizures\u2019 includes seizure of the\nperson\u201d).\n   The violation of the right to consular notification, in\ncontrast, is at best remotely connected to the gathering of\nevidence. Article 36 has nothing whatsoever to do with\nsearches or interrogations. Indeed, Article 36 does not\n14              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nguarantee defendants any assistance at all. The provision\nsecures only a right of foreign nationals to have their\nconsulate informed of their arrest or detention\u2014not to\nhave their consulate intervene, or to have law enforcement\nauthorities cease their investigation pending any such\nnotice or intervention. In most circumstances, there is\nlikely to be little connection between an Article 36 viola\ntion and evidence or statements obtained by police.\n   Moreover, the reasons we often require suppression for\nFourth and Fifth Amendment violations are entirely\nabsent from the consular notification context. We require\nexclusion of coerced confessions both because we disap\nprove of such coercion and because such confessions tend\nto be unreliable. Watkins v. Sowders, 449 U. S. 341, 347\n(1981). We exclude the fruits of unreasonable searches on\nthe theory that without a strong deterrent, the constraints\nof the Fourth Amendment might be too easily disregarded\nby law enforcement. Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S.\n206, 217 (1960). The situation here is quite different. The\nfailure to inform a defendant of his Article 36 rights is\nunlikely, with any frequency, to produce unreliable confes\nsions. And unlike the search-and-seizure context\u2014where\nthe need to obtain valuable evidence may tempt authori\nties to transgress Fourth Amendment limitations\u2014police\nwin little, if any, practical advantage from violating Arti\ncle 36. Suppression would be a vastly disproportionate\nremedy for an Article 36 violation.\n   Sanchez-Llamas counters that the failure to inform\ndefendants of their right to consular notification gives\nthem \u201ca misleadingly incomplete picture of [their] legal\noptions,\u201d Brief for Petitioner in No. 04\u201310566, p. 42, and\nthat suppression will give authorities an incentive to abide\nby Article 36.\n   Leaving aside the suggestion that it is the role of police\ngenerally to advise defendants of their legal options, we\nthink other constitutional and statutory requirements\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\neffectively protect the interests served, in Sanchez-Llamas\u2019\nview, by Article 36. A foreign national detained on suspi\ncion of crime, like anyone else in our country, enjoys under\nour system the protections of the Due Process Clause.\nAmong other things, he is entitled to an attorney, and is\nprotected against compelled self-incrimination. See Wong\nWing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228, 238 (1896) (\u201c[A]ll\npersons within the territory of the United States are enti\ntled to the protection guaranteed by\u201d the Fifth and Sixth\nAmendments). Article 36 adds little to these \u201clegal options,\u201d\nand we think it unnecessary to apply the exclusionary rule\nwhere other constitutional and statutory protections\u2014many\nof them already enforced by the exclusionary rule\u2014\nsafeguard the same interests Sanchez-Llamas claims are\nadvanced by Article 36.\n   Finally, suppression is not the only means of vindicating\nVienna Convention rights. A defendant can raise an\nArticle 36 claim as part of a broader challenge to the\nvoluntariness of his statements to police. If he raises an\nArticle 36 violation at trial, a court can make appropriate\naccommodations to ensure that the defendant secures, to\nthe extent possible, the benefits of consular assistance. Of\ncourse, diplomatic avenues\u2014the primary means of enforc\ning the Convention\u2014also remain open.\n   In sum, neither the Vienna Convention itself nor our\nprecedents applying the exclusionary rule support sup\npression of Sanchez-Llamas\u2019 statements to police.\n                             B\n  The Virginia courts denied petitioner Bustillo\u2019s Article\n36 claim on the ground that he failed to raise it at trial or\non direct appeal. The general rule in federal habeas cases\nis that a defendant who fails to raise a claim on direct\nappeal is barred from raising the claim on collateral re\nview. See Massaro v. United States, 538 U. S. 500, 504\n(2003); Bousley v. United States, 523 U. S. 614, 621 (1998).\n16              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThere is an exception if a defendant can demonstrate both\n\u201ccause\u201d for not raising the claim at trial, and \u201cprejudice\u201d\nfrom not having done so. Massaro, supra, at 504. Like\nmany States, Virginia applies a similar rule in state post-\nconviction proceedings, and did so here to bar Bustillo\u2019s\nVienna Convention claim. Normally, in our review of\nstate-court judgments, such rules constitute an adequate\nand independent state-law ground preventing us from\nreviewing the federal claim. Coleman v. Thompson, 501\nU. S. 722, 729 (1991). Bustillo contends, however, that\nstate procedural default rules cannot apply to Article 36\nclaims. He argues that the Convention requires that\nArticle 36 rights be given \u201c \u2018full effect\u2019 \u201d and that Virginia\u2019s\nprocedural default rules \u201cprevented any effect (much less\n\u2018full effect\u2019) from being given to\u201d those rights. Brief for\nPetitioner in No. 05\u201351, p. 35.\n   This is not the first time we have been asked to set aside\nprocedural default rules for a Vienna Convention claim.\nRespondent Johnson and the United States persuasively\nargue that this question is controlled by our decision in\nBreard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371 (1998) (per curiam). In\nBreard, the petitioner failed to raise an Article 36 claim in\nstate court\u2014at trial or on collateral review\u2014and then\nsought to have the claim heard in a subsequent federal\nhabeas proceeding. Id., at 375. He argued that \u201cthe Con\nvention is the \u2018supreme law of the land\u2019 and thus trumps\nthe procedural default doctrine.\u201d Ibid. We rejected this\nargument as \u201cplainly incorrect,\u201d for two reasons. Ibid.\nFirst, we observed, \u201cit has been recognized in interna\ntional law that, absent a clear and express statement to\nthe contrary, the procedural rules of the forum State\ngovern the implementation of the treaty in that State.\u201d\nIbid. Furthermore, we reasoned that while treaty protec\ntions such as Article 36 may constitute supreme federal\nlaw, this is \u201cno less true of provisions of the Constitution\nitself, to which rules of procedural default apply.\u201d Id., at\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n376. In light of Breard\u2019s holding, Bustillo faces an uphill\ntask in arguing that the Convention requires States to set\naside their procedural default rules for Article 36 claims.\n  Bustillo offers two reasons why Breard does not control\nhis case. He first argues that Breard\u2019s holding concerning\nprocedural default was \u201cunnecessary to the result,\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioner in No. 05\u201351, p. 45, because the petitioner\nthere could not demonstrate prejudice from the default\nand because, in any event, a subsequent federal statute\u2014\nthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996, 110 Stat. 1214\u2014superseded any right the petitioner\nhad under the Vienna Convention to have his claim heard\non collateral review. We find Bustillo\u2019s contention unper\nsuasive. Our resolution of the procedural default question\nin Breard was the principal reason for the denial of the\npetitioner\u2019s claim, and the discussion of the issue occupied\nthe bulk of our reasoning. See 523 U. S., at 375\u2013377. It is\nno answer to argue, as Bustillo does, that the holding in\nBreard was \u201cunnecessary\u201d simply because the petitioner in\nthat case had several ways to lose. See Richmond Screw\nAnchor Co. v. United States, 275 U. S. 331, 340 (1928).\n  Bustillo\u2019s second reason is less easily dismissed. He\nargues that since Breard, the ICJ has interpreted the\nVienna Convention to preclude the application of proce\ndural default rules to Article 36 claims. The LaGrand\nCase (F. R. G. v. U. S.), 2001 I. C. J. 466 (Judgment of\nJune 27) (LaGrand), and the Case Concerning Avena and\nother Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. No.\n128 (Judgment of Mar. 31) (Avena), were brought before\nthe ICJ by the governments of Germany and Mexico,\nrespectively, on behalf of several of their nationals facing\ndeath sentences in the United States. The foreign gov\nernments claimed that their nationals had not been in\nformed of their right to consular notification. They further\nargued that application of the procedural default rule to\ntheir nationals\u2019 Vienna Convention claims failed to give\n18                 SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cfull effect\u201d to the purposes of the Convention, as required\nby Article 36. The ICJ agreed, explaining that the defen\ndants had procedurally defaulted their claims \u201cbecause of\nthe failure of the American authorities to comply with\ntheir obligation under Article 36.\u201d LaGrand, supra, at\n497, \u00b691; see also Avena, supra, \u00b6113. Application of the\nprocedural default rule in such circumstances, the ICJ\nreasoned, \u201cprevented [courts] from attaching any legal\nsignificance\u201d to the fact that the violation of Article 36\nkept the foreign governments from assisting in their na\ntionals\u2019 defense. LaGrand, supra, at 497, \u00b691; see also\nAvena, supra, \u00b6113.\n   Bustillo argues that LaGrand and Avena warrant revis\niting the procedural default holding of Breard. In a simi\nlar vein, several amici contend that \u201cthe United States is\nobligated to comply with the Convention, as interpreted by\nthe ICJ.\u201d Brief for ICJ Experts 11 (emphases added). We\ndisagree. Although the ICJ\u2019s interpretation deserves\n\u201crespectful consideration,\u201d Breard, supra, at 375, we con\nclude that it does not compel us to reconsider our under\nstanding of the Convention in Breard.4\n   Under our Constitution, \u201c[t]he judicial Power of the\nUnited States\u201d is \u201cvested in one supreme Court, and in\nsuch inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to\ntime ordain and establish.\u201d Art. III, \u00a71. That \u201cjudicial\nPower . . . extend[s] to . . . Treaties.\u201d Id., \u00a72. And, as Chief\nJustice Marshall famously explained, that judicial power\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The dissent, in light of LaGrand and Avena, \u201cwould read Breard . . .\n\nas not saying that the Convention never trumps any procedural default\nrule.\u201d Post, at 26 (opinion of BREYER, J.). This requires more than\n\u201creading an exception into Breard\u2019s language,\u201d post, at 27, amounting\ninstead to overruling Breard\u2019s plain holding that the Convention does\nnot trump the procedural default doctrine. While the appeal of such a\ncourse to a Breard dissenter may be clear, see 523 U. S., at 380\n(BREYER, J., dissenting), \u201crespectful consideration\u201d of precedent should\nbegin at home.\n                      Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                    19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nincludes the duty \u201cto say what the law is.\u201d Marbury v.\nMadison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803). If treaties are to be\ngiven effect as federal law under our legal system, deter\nmining their meaning as a matter of federal law \u201cis em\nphatically the province and duty of the judicial depart\nment,\u201d headed by the \u201cone supreme Court\u201d established by\nthe Constitution. Ibid.; see also Williams v. Taylor, 529\nU. S. 362, 378\u2013379 (2000) (opinion of STEVENS, J.) (\u201cAt the\ncore of [the judicial] power is the federal courts\u2019 independent\nresponsibility\u2014independent from its coequal branches in\nthe Federal Government, and independent from the sepa\nrate authority of the several States\u2014to interpret federal\nlaw\u201d). It is against this background that the United States\nratified, and the Senate gave its advice and consent to, the\nvarious agreements that govern referral of Vienna Con\nvention disputes to the ICJ.\n  Nothing in the structure or purpose of the ICJ suggests\nthat its interpretations were intended to be conclusive on\nour courts.5 The ICJ\u2019s decisions have \u201cno binding force\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 The dissent\u2019s extensive list of lower court opinions that have \u201clooked\n\nto the ICJ for guidance,\u201d post, at 21\u201322, is less impressive than first\nappears. Many of the cited opinions merely refer to, or briefly describe,\nICJ decisions without in any way relying on them as authority. See,\ne.g., Committee of United States Citizens Living in Nicaragua v.\nReagan, 859 F. 2d 929, 932, 935 (CADC 1988); Conservation Law\nFoundation of New England v. Secretary of Interior, 790 F. 2d 965, 967\n(CA1 1986); Narenji v. Civiletti, 617 F. 2d 745, 748 (CADC 1979); Diggs\nv. Richardson, 555 F. 2d 848, 849 (CADC 1976); Rogers v. Societe\nInternationale Pour Participations Industrielles et Commerciales, S. A.,\n278 F. 2d 268, 273, n. 3 (CADC 1960) (Fahy, J., dissenting). Others cite\nICJ opinions alongside law review articles for general propositions\nabout international law. See, e.g., McKesson Corp. v. Islamic Republic\nof Iran, 52 F. 3d 346, 352 (CADC 1995); Princz v. Federal Republic of\nGermany, 26 F. 3d 1166, 1180, 1184 (CADC 1994) (Wald, J., dissent\ning); Sadat v. Mertes, 615 F. 2d 1176, 1187, n. 14 (CA7 1980); United\nStates v. Postal, 589 F. 2d 862, 869 (CA5 1979). Moreover, all but two\nof the cited decisions from this Court concern technical issues of bound\nary demarcation. See post, at 21.\n20              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexcept between the parties and in respect of that particu\nlar case,\u201d Statute of the International Court of Justice,\nArt. 59, 59 Stat. 1062, T. S. No. 993 (1945) (emphasis\nadded). Any interpretation of law the ICJ renders in the\ncourse of resolving particular disputes is thus not binding\nprecedent even as to the ICJ itself; there is accordingly\nlittle reason to think that such interpretations were in\ntended to be controlling on our courts. The ICJ\u2019s principal\npurpose is to arbitrate particular disputes between na\ntional governments. Id., at 1055 (ICJ is \u201cthe principal\njudicial organ of the United Nations\u201d); see also Art. 34, id.,\nat 1059 (\u201cOnly states [i.e., countries] may be parties in\ncases before the Court\u201d). While each member of the\nUnited Nations has agreed to comply with decisions of the\nICJ \u201cin any case to which it is a party,\u201d United Nations\nCharter, Art. 94(1), 59 Stat. 1051, T. S. No. 933 (1945), the\nCharter\u2019s procedure for noncompliance\u2014referral to the\nSecurity Council by the aggrieved state\u2014contemplates\nquintessentially international remedies, Art. 94(2), ibid.\n   In addition, \u201c[w]hile courts interpret treaties for them\nselves, the meaning given them by the departments of\ngovernment particularly charged with their negotiation\nand enforcement is given great weight.\u201d Kolovrat v. Ore\ngon, 366 U. S. 187, 194 (1961). Although the United\nStates has agreed to \u201cdischarge its international obliga\ntions\u201d in having state courts give effect to the decision in\nAvena, it has not taken the view that the ICJ\u2019s interpreta\ntion of Article 36 is binding on our courts. President Bush,\nMemorandum for the Attorney General (Feb. 28, 2005),\nApp. to Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in\nMedell\u00edn v. Dretke, O. T. 2004, No. 04\u20135928, p. 9a. More\nover, shortly after Avena, the United States withdrew\nfrom the Optional Protocol concerning Vienna Convention\ndisputes. Whatever the effect of Avena and LaGrand\nbefore this withdrawal, it is doubtful that our courts\nshould give decisive weight to the interpretation of a\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntribunal whose jurisdiction in this area is no longer recog\nnized by the United States.\n   LaGrand and Avena are therefore entitled only to the\n\u201crespectful consideration\u201d due an interpretation of an\ninternational agreement by an international court.\nBreard, 523 U. S., at 375. Even according such considera\ntion, the ICJ\u2019s interpretation cannot overcome the plain\nimport of Article 36. As we explained in Breard, the pro\ncedural rules of domestic law generally govern the imple\nmentation of an international treaty. Ibid. In addition,\nArticle 36 makes clear that the rights it provides \u201cshall be\nexercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of\nthe receiving State\u201d provided that \u201cfull effect . . . be given\nto the purposes for which the rights accorded under this\nArticle are intended.\u201d Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. In\nthe United States, this means that the rule of procedural\ndefault\u2014which applies even to claimed violations of our\nConstitution, see Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 129\n(1982)\u2014applies also to Vienna Convention claims. Busti\nllo points to nothing in the drafting history of Article 36 or\nin the contemporary practice of other signatories that\nundermines this conclusion.\n   The ICJ concluded that where a defendant was not\nnotified of his rights under Article 36, application of the\nprocedural default rule failed to give \u201cfull effect\u201d to the\npurposes of Article 36 because it prevented courts from\nattaching \u201clegal significance\u201d to the Article 36 violation.\nLaGrand, 2001 I. C. J., at 497\u2013498, \u00b6\u00b690\u201391. This reason\ning overlooks the importance of procedural default rules in\nan adversary system, which relies chiefly on the parties to\nraise significant issues and present them to the courts in\nthe appropriate manner at the appropriate time for adju\ndication. See Castro v. United States, 540 U. S. 375, 386\n(2003) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment) (\u201cOur adversary system is designed around the\npremise that the parties know what is best for them, and\n22              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nare responsible for advancing the facts and arguments\nentitling them to relief\u201d). Procedural default rules are\ndesigned to encourage parties to raise their claims promptly\nand to vindicate \u201cthe law\u2019s important interest in the finality\nof judgments.\u201d Massaro, 538 U. S., at 504. The conse\nquence of failing to raise a claim for adjudication at the\nproper time is generally forfeiture of that claim. As a\nresult, rules such as procedural default routinely deny \u201clegal\nsignificance\u201d\u2014in the Avena and LaGrand sense\u2014to other\nwise viable legal claims.\n   Procedural default rules generally take on greater im\nportance in an adversary system such as ours than in the\nsort of magistrate-directed, inquisitorial legal system\ncharacteristic of many of the other countries that are\nsignatories to the Vienna Convention. \u201cWhat makes a\nsystem adversarial rather than inquisitorial is . . . the\npresence of a judge who does not (as an inquisitor does)\nconduct the factual and legal investigation himself, but\ninstead decides on the basis of facts and arguments pro\nand con adduced by the parties.\u201d McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501\nU. S. 171, 181, n. 2 (1991). In an inquisitorial system, the\nfailure to raise a legal error can in part be attributed to the\nmagistrate, and thus to the state itself. In our system,\nhowever, the responsibility for failing to raise an issue\ngenerally rests with the parties themselves.\n   The ICJ\u2019s interpretation of Article 36 is inconsistent\nwith the basic framework of an adversary system. Under\nthe ICJ\u2019s reading of \u201cfull effect,\u201d Article 36 claims could\ntrump not only procedural default rules, but any number\nof other rules requiring parties to present their legal\nclaims at the appropriate time for adjudication. If the\nState\u2019s failure to inform the defendant of his Article 36\nrights generally excuses the defendant\u2019s failure to comply\nwith relevant procedural rules, then presumably rules\nsuch as statutes of limitations and prohibitions against\nfiling successive habeas petitions must also yield in the\n                       Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                       23\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\nface of Article 36 claims. This sweeps too broadly, for it\nreads the \u201cfull effect\u201d proviso in a way that leaves little\nroom for Article 36\u2019s clear instruction that Article 36\nrights \u201cshall be exercised in conformity with the laws and\nregulations of the receiving State.\u201d Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T.,\nat 101.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The  dissent would read the ICJ\u2019s decisions to require that proce\ndural default rules give way only where \u201cthe State is unwilling to\nprovide some other effective remedy, for example (if the lawyer acts\nincompetently in respect to Convention rights of which the lawyer was\naware) an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.\u201d Post, at 25 (opinion\nof BREYER, J.). But both LaGrand and Avena indicate that the avail\nability of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not an adequate\nremedy for an Article 36 violation. See LaGrand Case (F. R. G. v.\nU. S.), 2001 I. C. J. 466, 497, \u00b691 (Judgment of June 27) (requiring\nsuspension of state procedural default rule even though \u201cUnited States\ncourts could and did examine the professional competence of counsel\nassigned to the indigent LaGrands by reference to United States\nconstitutional standards\u201d); see also Case Concerning Avena and other\nMexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. No. 128, \u00b6134 (Judg\nment of Mar. 31).\n   To the extent the dissent suggests that the ICJ\u2019s decisions could be\nread to prevent application of procedural default rules where a defen\ndant\u2019s attorney is unaware of Article 36, see post, at 24\u201325 (opinion of\nBREYER, J.), this interpretation of the Convention is in sharp conflict\nwith the role of counsel in our system. \u201cAttorney ignorance or inadver\ntence is not \u2018cause\u2019 because the attorney is the petitioner\u2019s agent when\nacting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation, and the petitioner\nmust \u2018bear the risk of attorney error.\u2019 \u201d Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S.\n722, 753 (1991) (quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 488 (1986)).\nUnder our system, an attorney\u2019s lack of knowledge does not excuse the\ndefendant\u2019s default, unless the attorney\u2019s overall representation falls\nbelow what is required by the Sixth Amendment. In any event, Bustillo\nhimself does not argue that the applicability of procedural default rules\nhinges on whether a foreign national\u2019s attorney was aware of Article 36.\nSee Brief for Petitioner in No. 05\u201351, p. 38 (\u201c[A] lawyer may not,\nconsistent with the purposes of Article 36, unilaterally forfeit a foreign\nnational\u2019s opportunity to communicate with his consulate\u201d). In fact,\nBustillo has conceded that his \u201cattorney at trial was aware of his\nclient\u2019s rights under the Vienna Convention.\u201d App. in No. 05\u201351,\np. 203, n. 5.\n24              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Much as Sanchez-Llamas cannot show that suppression\nis an appropriate remedy for Article 36 violations under\ndomestic law principles, so too Bustillo cannot show that\nnormally applicable procedural default rules should be\nsuspended in light of the type of right he claims. In this\nregard, a comparison of Article 36 and a suspect\u2019s rights\nunder Miranda disposes of Bustillo\u2019s claim. Bustillo con\ntends that applying procedural default rules to Article 36\nrights denies such rights \u201cfull effect\u201d because the violation\nitself\u2014i.e., the failure to inform defendants of their right\nto consular notification\u2014prevents them from becoming\naware of their Article 36 rights and asserting them at\ntrial. Of course, precisely the same thing is true of rights\nunder Miranda. Police are required to advise suspects\nthat they have a right to remain silent and a right to an\nattorney. See Miranda, 384 U. S., at 479; see also\nDickerson, 530 U. S., at 435. If police do not give such\nwarnings, and counsel fails to object, it is equally true that\na suspect may not be \u201caware he even had such rights until\nwell after his trial had concluded.\u201d Brief for Petitioner in\nNo. 05\u201351, p. 35. Nevertheless, it is well established that\nwhere a defendant fails to raise a Miranda claim at trial,\nprocedural default rules may bar him from raising the\nclaim in a subsequent postconviction proceeding. Wain\nwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 87 (1977).\n   Bustillo responds that an Article 36 claim more closely\nresembles a claim, under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83\n(1963), that the prosecution failed to disclose exculpatory\nevidence\u2014a type of claim that often can be asserted for\nthe first time only in postconviction proceedings. See\nUnited States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U. S. 74, 83, n. 9\n(2004). The analogy is inapt. In the case of a Brady claim,\nit is impossible for the defendant to know as a factual\nmatter that a violation has occurred before the exculpa\ntory evidence is disclosed. By contrast, a defendant is well\naware of the fact that he was not informed of his Article 36\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            25\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrights, even if the legal significance of that fact eludes him.\n   Finally, relying on Massaro v. United States, 538 U. S.\n500, Bustillo argues that Article 36 claims \u201care most ap\npropriately raised post-trial or on collateral review.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioner in No. 05\u201351, p. 39. Massaro held that\nclaims of ineffective assistance of counsel may be raised\nfor the first time in a proceeding under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72255.\nThat decision, however, involved the question of the\nproper forum for federal habeas claims. Bustillo, by con\ntrast, asks us to require the States to hear Vienna Conven\ntion claims raised for the first time in state postconviction\nproceedings. Given that the Convention itself imposes no\nsuch requirement, we do not perceive any grounds for us\nto revise state procedural rules in this fashion. See\nDickerson, supra, at 438.\n   We therefore conclude, as we did in Breard, that claims\nunder Article 36 of the Vienna Convention may be sub\njected to the same procedural default rules that apply\ngenerally to other federal-law claims.\n                        *    *      *\n  Although these cases involve the delicate question of the\napplication of an international treaty, the issues in many\nways turn on established principles of domestic law. Our\nholding in no way disparages the importance of the Vienna\nConvention. The relief petitioners request is, by any meas\nure, extraordinary. Sanchez-Llamas seeks a suppression\nremedy for an asserted right with little if any connection to\nthe gathering of evidence; Bustillo requests an exception to\nprocedural rules that is accorded to almost no other right,\nincluding many of our most fundamental constitutional\nprotections. It is no slight to the Convention to deny\npetitioners\u2019 claims under the same principles we would\napply to an Act of Congress, or to the Constitution itself.\n  The judgments of the Supreme Court of Oregon and the\nSupreme Court of Virginia are affirmed.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

As to the suppression and procedural\ndefault issues, I join the Court\u2019s judgment. The dissenting\nopinion veers away from the two cases here for review,\nimagining other situations unlike those at hand. In nei\nther of the cases before us would I remand for further\nproceedings.\n  I turn first to the question whether a violation of Article\n36 requires suppression of statements to police officers in\nSanchez-Llamas\u2019 case and others like it. Shortly after his\narrest and in advance of any police interrogation, Sanchez-\nLlamas received the warnings required by Miranda v.\nArizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), in both English and Spanish.\nTr. 122 (Nov. 16, 2000). He indicated that he understood\n2                 SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                 GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthose warnings, id., at 123, telling the police that he had\nlived in the United States for approximately 11 years, id., at\n124, 143, 177. After a break in questioning, Sanchez-\nLlamas again received Miranda warnings in Spanish, and\nagain indicated that he understood them. Id., at 129, 176.\nSanchez-Llamas, with his life experience in the United\nStates, scarcely resembles the uncomprehending detainee\nimagined by JUSTICE BREYER, post, at 30. Such a detainee\nwould have little need to invoke the Vienna Convention, for\nMiranda warnings a defendant is unable to comprehend\ngive the police no green light for interrogation. Moran v.\nBurbine, 475 U. S. 412, 421 (1986) (a defendant\u2019s waiver of\nMiranda rights must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent,\ni.e., \u201cthe product of a free and deliberate choice . . . made\nwith a full awareness of both the nature of the right being\nabandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon\nit\u201d); United States v. Garibay, 143 F. 3d 534, 537\u2013540 (CA9\n1998) (defendant, who had difficulty understanding English,\ndid not knowingly and intelligently waive his Miranda\nrights where the police recited the Miranda warnings only\nin English); United States v. Short, 790 F. 2d 464, 469 (CA6\n1986) (defendant\u2019s limited comprehension of English cast\nsubstantial doubt on the validity of her Miranda waiver).1\n   In contrast to Miranda warnings, which must be given\non the spot before the police interrogate, Article 36 of the\nVienna Convention does not require the arresting author\nity to contact the consular post instantly. See Case Con\ncerning Avena and other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Before\n           trial, Sanchez-Llamas moved to suppress his statements to\npolice on voluntariness grounds. The trial court denied the motion,\nfinding that clear and convincing evidence established Sanchez-Llamas\u2019\nknowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of his Miranda rights. Tr.\n232 (Nov. 16, 2000); App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 04\u201310566, pp. 10\u201311.\nNeither the Oregon Court of Appeals nor the Oregon Supreme Court\naddressed Sanchez-Llamas\u2019 voluntariness challenge, and this Court\ndeclined to review the question.\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

No. 128, \u00b697 (Judgment of Mar. 31)\n(Avena) (United States\u2019s notification of Mexican consulate\nwithin three working days of detainee\u2019s arrest satisfied\nArticle 36(1)(b)\u2019s \u201cwithout delay\u201d requirement); U.

Nor does that\nArticle demand that questioning await notice to, and a\nresponse from, consular officials.2 It is unsurprising,\ntherefore, that the well researched dissenting opinion has\nnot found even a single case in which any court, any place\nhas in fact found suppression an appropriate remedy\nbased on no provision of domestic law, but solely on an\narresting officer\u2019s failure to comply with Article 36 of the\nVienna Convention. See post, at 32; ante, at 9, n. 3.\n  The Court points out, and I agree, that in fitting circum\nstances, a defendant might successfully \u201craise an Article\n36 claim as part of a broader challenge to the voluntari\nness of [a detainee\u2019s] statements to police.\u201d Ante, at 15. In\nthat way, \u201cfull effect\u201d could be given to Article 36 in a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 See Declaration of Ambassador Maura A.

Avena,\n2004 I. C.

OREGON\n\n               GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment\n\nmanner consistent with U. S. rules and regulations. But\nthe question presented here is whether suppression is\nwarranted simply because the State\u2019s authorities failed to\ncomply with Article 36 of the Vienna Convention. Neither\nthe Convention itself nor the practice of our treaty part\nners establishes Sanchez-Llamas\u2019 entitlement to such a\nremedy. See El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd. v. Tsui Yuan\nTseng, 525 U. S. 155, 175\u2013176 (1999) (construing the\nWarsaw Convention in accord with the views of the United\nStates\u2019s treaty partners).\n   As to the procedural default issue, I note first two\nanomalies. The Court explains, and I agree, that it would\nbe extraordinary to hold that defendants, unaware of their\nMiranda rights because the police failed to convey the\nrequired warnings, would be subject to a State\u2019s proce\ndural default rules, but defendants not told of Article 36\nrights would face no such hindrance. See ante, at 24.\nFurthermore, as the dissent apparently recognizes, in the\nfederal court system, a later-in-time statute, codifying a\nfederal procedural default rule, would \u201csupersed[e] any\ninconsistent provision in the Convention.\u201d Post, at 25\u201326\n(citing Breard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371 (1998) (per curiam)).\nIn my view, it would be unseemly, to say the least, for this\nCourt to command state courts to relax their identical, or\neven less stringent procedural default rules, while federal\ncourts operate without constraint in this regard. Post, at\n26. That state of affairs, surely productive of friction in\nour federal system, should be resisted if there is a plausi\nble choice, i.e., if a reasonable interpretation of the federal\nstatute and international accord would avoid the conflict.\n   Critical for me, Bustillo has conceded that his \u201cattorney\nat trial was aware of his client\u2019s rights under the Vienna\nConvention.\u201d App. in No. 05\u201351, p. 203, n. 5.

C. J., \u00b6113); accord post, at 6, 16, 18, 23.\nNothing the State did or omitted to do here \u201cprecluded\ncounsel from . . . rais[ing] the question of a violation of the\nVienna Convention in the initial trial.\u201d Ibid. Had counsel\ndone so, the trial court could have made \u201cappropriate\naccommodations to ensure that the defendant secure[d], to\nthe extent possible, the benefits of consular assistance.\u201d\nAnte, at 15.3\n  In short, if there are some times when a Convention\nviolation, standing alone, might warrant suppression, or\nthe displacement of a State\u2019s ordinarily applicable proce\ndural default rules, neither Sanchez-Llamas\u2019 case nor\nBustillo\u2019s belongs in that category.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Furthermore, once Bustillo became aware of his Vienna Convention\n\nrights, nothing prevented him from raising an ineffective-assistance-of\ncounsel claim predicated on his trial counsel\u2019s failure to assert the\nState\u2019s violation of those rights. Through such a claim, as the dissent\nacknowledges, see post, at 16, 19, 25, 29, \u201cfull effect\u201d could have been\ngiven to Article 36, without dishonoring state procedural rules that are\ncompatible with due process. Bustillo did not include a Vienna-\nConvention-based, ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim along with his\ndirect Vienna Convention claim in his initial habeas petition. He later\nsought to amend his petition to add an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\nclaim, but the court held that the amendment did not relate back to the\ninitial pleading. Tr. of Oral Arg. 26, 42. The state court therefore\nrejected Bustillo\u2019s ineffectiveness claim as barred by the applicable\nstate statute of limitations. App. 132.

We granted certiorari in\nthese cases to consider three related questions: (1) May a\ncriminal defendant raise a claim (at trial or in a postcon\nviction proceeding) that state officials violated this provi\nsion?

And (3) is suppression of a defendant\u2019s confession\n(made to police after a violation of the Convention) an\nappropriate remedy?\n   The Court assumes, but does not decide, that the an\nswer to the first question is \u201cyes.\u201d Ante, at 7\u20138. It an\nswers the second question by holding that a State always\nmay apply its ordinary procedural default rules to a de\nfendant\u2019s claim of a Convention violation. Ante, at 15\u201325.\nIts answer to the third question is that suppression is\nnever an appropriate remedy for a Convention violation.\nAnte, at 8\u201315.\n   Unlike the majority, I would decide the first question\nand answer it affirmatively. A criminal defendant may, at\ntrial or in a postconviction proceeding, raise the claim that\nstate authorities violated the Convention in his case. My\nanswer to the second question is that sometimes state\nprocedural default rules must yield to the Convention\u2019s\ninsistence that domestic laws \u201cenable full effect to be given\nto the purposes for which\u201d Article 36\u2019s \u201crights . . . are\nintended.\u201d Art. 36(2), 21 U.

After answering these\nquestions, I would remand these cases, thereby permitting\nthe States to apply their own procedural and remedial\nlaws, but with the understanding that the Federal Consti\ntution requires that the application of those laws be con\nsistent with the Convention\u2019s demand for an effective\nremedy for an Article 36 violation.

The United States and 169 other na\ntions have ratified the Convention. Its adoption in 1963\nwas perhaps \u201cthe single most important event in the\nentire history of the consular institution.\u201d L. Lee, Consu\nlar Law and Practice 26 (2d ed. 1991). The Convention\ndefines consular functions to include \u201cprotecting in the\nreceiving State the interests of the sending State and of its\nnationals,\u201d and \u201chelping and assisting nationals . . . of the\nsending State.\u201d Arts. 5(a), (e), 21 U. S. T., at 82\u201383. The\nUnited States ratified the Convention in 1969.\n   Article 36 of the Convention governs relations between a\nconsulate and its nationals, particularly those who have\nbeen arrested by the host country. Its object is to assure\nconsular communication and assistance to such nationals,\nwho may not fully understand the host country\u2019s legal\nregime or even speak its language. Article 36 reads as\nfollows:\n    \u201c1. With a view to facilitating the exercise of consular\n    functions relating to nationals of the sending State:\n      \u201c(a) consular officers shall be free to communicate\n    with nationals of the sending State and to have access\n    to them. Nationals of the sending State shall have the\n    same freedom with respect to communication with\n    and access to consular officers of the sending State;\n      \u201c(b) if he so requests, the competent authorities of\n    the receiving State shall, without delay, inform the\n    consular post of the sending State if, within its consu\n    lar district, a national of that State is arrested or\n    committed to prison or to custody pending trial or is\n    detained in any other manner.

The rights referred to in paragraph 1 of this Arti\n    cle shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and\n    regulations of the receiving State, subject to the pro\n    viso, however, that the said laws and regulations\n    must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for\n    which the rights accorded under this Article are in\n    tended.\u201d 21 U. S. T., at 100\u2013101 (emphasis added).\nThe U. S. State Department\u2019s Foreign Affairs Manual has\nlong stressed the importance the United States places\nupon these provisions. It says, \u201c[O]ne of the basic func\ntions of a consular office has been to provide a \u2018cultural\nbridge\u2019 between the host community and the [U. S. na\ntional]. No one needs that cultural bridge more than the\nindividual U.

No.\n128 (Judgment of Mar. 31) (Avena) (case brought by\nMexico).\n   In Germany\u2019s case, the ICJ rejected the United States\u2019\nclaim that the \u201crights of consular notification and access\nunder [Article 36] are rights of States, and not of individu\nals.\u201d LaGrand, 2001 I. C. J., at 19\u201320, \u00b676. It held in\nstead that (1) if an arrested foreign national is prejudiced\nby the host country\u2019s failure to inform him of his Article 36\nrights, and (2) if that individual has \u201cbeen subjected to\nprolonged detention or convicted and sentenced to severe\npenalties,\u201d then a diplomatic apology alone is not a suffi\ncient remedy. Id., at 32\u201333, \u00b6125. Rather, the Convention\nrequires the host country, in that case the United States,\n\u201cto allow the review and reconsideration of the\u201d foreign\nnational\u2019s \u201cconviction and sentence by taking account of\nthe violation of the rights set forth in the Convention.\u201d\nIbid. The ICJ added that \u201c[t]he choice of means\u201d for pro\nviding this review \u201cmust be left to the United States.\u201d\nIbid. In addition, the ICJ stated that in the case before it,\napplication of a procedural default rule (that is, the rule\nthat the LaGrands could not bring their Convention\nclaims in habeas proceedings because they had not raised\nthose claims at trial) violated Article 36(2) of the Conven\ntion because it \u201chad the effect of preventing \u2018full effect\n[from being] given to the purposes for which the rights\naccorded under this article are intended.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 22, \u00b691\n(quoting Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101). In the ICJ\u2019s view,\nit was \u201cthe failure of the American authorities to comply\u201d\nwith Article 36 that prevented the LaGrands from raising\ntheir claims earlier. LaGrand, supra, at 22, \u00b691.\n   In Mexico\u2019s case, the ICJ reiterated its view that Article\n36, in addition to imposing obligations on member nations,\n6               SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nalso allows foreign nationals to bring claims based on\nthose violations in domestic judicial proceedings. The ICJ\nnoted that, as a matter of international law, breach of a\ntreaty ordinarily \u201c \u2018involves an obligation to make repara\ntion in an adequate form.\u2019 \u201d Avena, supra, \u00b6119 (quoting\nFactory at Chorz\u00f3w, Jurisdiction, 1927, P. C. I. J., ser. A,\nNo. 9, p. 21). Applying that principle to the Convention,\nthe ICJ concluded that \u201cthe remedy to make good . . .\nviolations [of Article 36] should consist in an obligation on\nthe United States to permit review and reconsideration of\nthese nationals\u2019 cases by the United States courts . . . with\na view to ascertaining whether in each case the violation\n. . . caused actual prejudice to the defendant in the process\nof administration of criminal justice.\u201d Avena, 2004 I.

The ICJ declined to specify the\nmeans by which American courts should provide such\n\u201creview and reconsideration.\u201d Instead, the ICJ said, the\nappropriate remedy depends upon an examination of \u201cthe\nconcrete circumstances of each case\u201d and should be deter\nmined \u201cby the United States courts concerned in the proc\ness of their review and reconsideration.\u201d Id., \u00b6127.\n    In respect to procedural default, the ICJ referenced\nwhat it said in LaGrand, while adding the critically im\nportant qualification that the cases in which the Conven\ntion blocked application of a procedural default rule were\nthose in which it was \u201cthe failure of the United States\nitself to inform\u201d an arrested foreign national of his right to\ncontact the consulate that \u201cprecluded counsel from being\nin a position to have raised the question of a violation of\nthe Vienna Convention in the initial trial.\u201d Avena, supra,\n\u00b6113.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

The Court assumes that the answer to this\nquestion is \u201cyes,\u201d but it does not decide the matter because\nit concludes in any event that the petitioners are not\nentitled to the remedies they seek. As explained below, I\nwould resolve those remedial questions differently.\nHence, I must decide, rather than assume, the answer to\nthe first question presented.\n  Regardless, the first question raises an important issue\nof federal law that has arisen hundreds of times in the\nlower federal and state courts. See generally Wooster,\nConstruction and Application of Vienna Convention on\n8               SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v.

The parties also agree that we need\nnot decide whether the Convention creates a \u201cprivate right\nof action,\u201d i.e., a private right that would allow an individ\nual to bring a lawsuit for enforcement of the Convention or\nfor damages based on its violation. Rather, the question\nhere is whether the Convention provides, in these cases,\nlaw applicable in legal proceedings that might have been\nbrought irrespective of the Vienna Convention claim, here\nan ordinary criminal appeal and an ordinary postconvic\ntion proceeding.\n   Bustillo, for example, has brought an action under a\nVirginia statute that allows any convicted person to seek\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrelease from custody on the ground that \u201che is detained\nwithout lawful authority.\u201d Va. Code Ann. \u00a78.01\u2013654(A)(1)\n(Lexis 2005). Sanchez-Llamas has challenged his state\ncriminal conviction on direct appeal, and in that proceed\ning he is entitled to claim that his conviction violates state\nor federal law. In both cases the petitioners argue that a\ncourt decision favoring the prosecution would violate the\nConvention (as properly interpreted), and therefore the\nConstitution forbids any such decision. See U. S. Const.,\nArt. VI, cl. 2. This argument in effect claims that the\nConvention itself provides applicable law that here would\nfavor the petitioners if, but only if, they are correct as to\ntheir interpretation of the Convention (which is, of course,\na different matter).\n  The petitioners must be right in respect to their claim\nthat the Convention provides law that here courts could\napply in their respective proceedings. The Convention is a\ntreaty. And \u201call Treaties made . . . under the Authority of\nthe United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land;\nand the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby.\u201d\nU. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. As Chief Justice Marshall long\nago explained, under the Supremacy Clause a treaty is \u201cto\nbe regarded in courts of justice as equivalent to an act of\nthe legislature, whenever it operates of itself without the\naid of any legislative provision.\u201d Foster, supra, at 314.\n  Directly to the point, this Court stated long ago that a\ntreaty \u201cis a law of the land as an act of Congress is, when\never its provisions prescribe a rule by which the rights of\nthe private citizen or subject may be determined. And\nwhen such rights are of a nature to be enforced in a court\nof justice,\u201d in such a case the court is to \u201cresor[t] to the\ntreaty for a rule of decision for the case before it as it\nwould to a statute.\u201d Head Money Cases, 112 U. S. 580,\n598\u2013599 (1884).\n  As noted above, see supra, at 8, the parties agree that\nthe Convention \u201coperates of itself without the aid of any\n10              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlegislative provision.\u201d Foster, supra, at 314. The question,\nthen, is the one this Court set forth in the Head Money\nCases: Does the Convention set forth a \u201claw\u201d with the legal\nstature of an Act of Congress? And as the Court ex\nplained, we are to answer that question by asking, does\nthe Convention \u201cprescribe a rule by which the rights of the\nprivate citizen . . . may be determined\u201d? Are the obliga\ntions set forth in Article 36(1)(b) \u201cof a nature to be en\nforced in a court of justice\u201d?\n   The \u201cnature\u201d of the Convention provisions raised by the\npetitioners indicates that they are intended to set forth\nstandards that are judicially enforceable. Those provi\nsions consist of the rights of a foreign national \u201carrested\u201d\nor \u201cdetained in any other manner\u201d (1) to have, on his\n\u201creques[t],\u201d the \u201cconsular post\u201d \u201cinform[ed]\u201d of that arrest\nor detention; (2) to have forwarded \u201cwithout delay\u201d any\n\u201ccommunication addressed to the consular post\u201d; and (3) to\nbe \u201cinform[ed] . . . without delay\u201d of those two \u201crights.\u201d\nArt. 36(1)(b), 21 U. S. T., at 101. These rights do not differ\nin their \u201cnature\u201d from other procedural rights that courts\ncommonly enforce. Cf. U. S. Const., Amdt. 6 (\u201cIn all crimi\nnal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to\nbe informed of the nature and cause of the accusation\u201d);\nibid. (\u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy\nthe right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his\ndefence\u201d); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966).\n   Moreover, the language of Article 36 speaks directly of\nthe \u201crights\u201d of the individual foreign national. See Art.\n36(1)(b), 21 U. S. T., at 101 (\u201cThe said authorities shall\ninform the person concerned without delay of his rights\nunder this sub-paragraph\u201d (emphasis added)). Article 36\nthus stands in stark contrast to other provisions of the\nConvention, which speak in terms of the rights of the\nmember nations or consular officials. Cf. Art. 9, id., at 86\n(discussing \u201cthe right of any of the Contracting Parties to\nfix the designation of consular officers\u201d (emphasis added));\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            11\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nArt. 34, id., at 98 (consular officials shall have \u201cfreedom of\nmovement and travel\u201d); Art. 35, id., at 99 (consular offi\ncials shall have \u201cfreedom of communication\u201d); Art. 41(1),\nid., at 103 (\u201cConsular officers shall not be liable to arrest\nor detention pending trial\u201d).\n    Suppose that a pre-Miranda federal statute had said\nthat arresting authorities \u201cshall inform a detained person\nwithout delay of his right to counsel.\u201d Would courts not\nhave automatically assumed that this statute created\napplicable law that a criminal defendant could invoke at\ntrial? What more would the statute have to say? See\nMedell\u00edn, 544 U. S., at 687 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting) (\u201cAnd\nif a statute were to provide, for example, that arresting\nauthorities \u2018shall inform a detained person without delay\nof his right to counsel,\u2019 \u201d what \u201cmore would be required\u201d to\npermit \u201ca defendant\u201d to \u201cinvoke that statute\u201d?).\n    Further, this Court has routinely permitted individuals\nto enforce treaty provisions similar to Article 36 in domes\ntic judicial proceedings. In United States v. Rauscher, 119\nU. S. 407, 410\u2013411 (1886), for example, this Court con\ncluded that the defendant could raise as a defense in his\nfederal criminal trial the violation of an extradition treaty\nthat said, \u201c \u2018It is agreed that the United States and Her\nBritannic Majesty shall, upon mutual requisitions by them\n. . . deliver up to justice all persons\u2019 \u201d charged with certain\ncrimes in the other country. Similarly, in Kolovrat v.\nOregon, 366 U. S. 187, 191, n. 6 (1961), the Court held that\nforeign nationals could challenge a state law limiting their\nright to recover an inheritance based on a treaty providing\nthat \u201c \u2018[i]n all that concerns the right of acquiring, possess\ning or disposing of every kind of property . . . citizens of\n[each country who reside in the other] shall enjoy the\nrights which the respective laws grant . . . in each of these\nstates to the subjects of the most favored nation.\u2019 \u201d And in\nAsakura v. Seattle, 265 U. S. 332, 340 (1924), the Court\nallowed a foreign national to challenge a city ordinance\n12              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nforbidding noncitizens from working as pawnbrokers\nunder a treaty stating that \u201c \u2018citizens or subjects of each of\nthe High Contracting Parties shall have liberty . . . to\ncarry on trade\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018generally to do anything incident to\nor necessary for trade upon the same terms as native\ncitizens or subjects.\u2019 \u201d\n   In all these cases, the Court recognized that (1) a treaty\nobligated the United States to treat foreign nationals in a\ncertain manner; (2) the obligation had been breached by\nthe Government\u2019s conduct; and (3) the foreign national\ncould therefore seek redress for that breach in a judicial\nproceeding, even though the treaty did not specifically\nmention judicial enforcement of its guarantees or even\nexpressly state that its provisions were intended to confer\nrights on the foreign national. Language and context\nargue yet more strongly here in favor of permitting a\ncriminal defendant in an appropriate case to find in the\nConvention a law to apply in the proceeding against him.\n   In addition, the Government concedes that individual\nconsular officials may enforce other provisions of the Con\nvention in American courts. For example, Article 43(1)\ngrants consular officials immunity from \u201cthe jurisdiction of\nthe\u201d host country\u2019s \u201cjudicial or administrative authorities\u201d\nfor \u201cacts performed in the exercise of consular functions.\u201d\n21 U. S. T., at 104. The federal courts have held that a\nconsular official may raise Article 43(1) in a judicial pro\nceeding, even though that provision does not expressly\nmention a judicial remedy. See, e.g., Risk v. Halvorsen,\n936 F. 2d 393, 397 (CA9 1991); Gerritsen v. de la Madrid\nHurtado, 819 F. 2d 1511, 1515\u20131516 (CA9 1987); see also\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14, n. 2 (citing\nwith approval these cases). What in Article 36 warrants\ntreating it differently in this respect?\n   Finally, the international tribunal that the United\nStates agreed would resolve disputes about the interpreta\ntion of the Convention, the ICJ, has twice ruled that an\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          13\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\narrested foreign national may raise a violation of the\narresting authorities\u2019 obligation to \u201cinform [him] without\ndelay of his rights under\u201d Article 36(1) in an American\njudicial proceeding. See Avena, 2004 I. C. J. No. 128;\nLaGrand, 2001 I. C. J. 466. That conclusion, as an \u201cinter\npretation of an international agreement by an interna\ntional court\u201d deserves our \u201c \u2018respectful consideration.\u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 21. That \u201crespectful consideration,\u201d for reasons I\nshall explain, see infra, at 18\u201321, counsels in favor of an\ninterpretation that is consistent with the ICJ\u2019s reading of\nthe Convention here.\n   The Government says to the contrary that Article 36 is\n\u201caddressed solely to the rights of States and not private\nindividuals\u201d; hence, a foreign national may not claim in an\nAmerican court that a State has convicted him without the\nconsular notification that Article 36 requires. Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 7. But its arguments are\nnot persuasive. The Government rests this conclusion\nprimarily upon its claim that there is a \u201clong-established\npresumption that treaties and other international agree\nments do not create judicially enforceable individual\nrights.\u201d Id., at 11.\n   The problem with that argument is that no such pre\nsumption exists. The Government cites three cases in\nsupport of its position, Charlton v. Kelly, 229 U. S. 447,\n474 (1913); Whitney v. Robertson, 124 U. S. 190, 195\n(1888); and Foster, 2 Pet., at 306\u2013307. The first of these,\nCharlton, says that the question whether a treaty has\nbeen abrogated by another nation\u2019s violations is a matter\nwith which \u201c \u2018judicial tribunals have nothing to do.\u2019 \u201d 229\nU. S., at 474. The second, Whitney, says that whether a\nsubsequent federal statute that abrogates a treaty violates\nthe United States\u2019 treaty obligations is a matter that has\n\u201cnot been confided to the judiciary.\u201d 124 U. S., at 195.\nThe third, Foster, says that in \u201ca controversy between two\nnations concerning national boundary, it is scarcely possi\n14              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nble that the courts of either should refuse to abide by the\nmeasures adopted by its own government.\u201d 2 Pet., at 307.\nWhat have these issues to do with the present one? How\ndo these cases support the presumption that the Govern\nment claims?\n   Regardless, as I have just said, see supra, at 9, the Head\nMoney Cases make clear that a treaty may confer certain\nenforceable \u201crights upon the citizens or subjects of one of\nthe nations residing in the territorial limits of the other.\u201d\n112 U. S., at 598; see also 2 Restatement (Third) on For\neign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7907 (1986) (here\ninafter Restatement) (\u201cA private person having rights\nagainst the United States under an international agree\nment may assert those rights in courts in the United\nStates\u201d). And the language of the Convention makes clear\nthat it is such a treaty. Indeed, to my knowledge no other\nnation\u2019s courts (or perhaps no more than one) have held to\nthe contrary. The cases cited by the respondents and the\nGovernment do not say otherwise. See Judgment of Nov.\n7, 2001, 5 BGHSt 116 (Germany) (deciding in light of\nLaGrand that the Convention creates individual rights,\nbut declining to suppress confession); Queen v. Abbrederis\n(1981) 51 F. L. R. 99, 115 (Ct. Crim. App. New South\nWales (Australia)) (deciding that Convention does not\n\u201caffect the carrying out of an investigation by interroga\ntion of a foreign person coming to this country\u201d). But see\nQueen v. Van Bergen [2000] 261 A. R. 387, 390 (Ct. App.\nAlberta (Canada)) (noting in dictum that the Convention\n\u201ccreates an obligation between states and is not one owed\nto the national,\u201d but affirming denial of suppression mo\ntion on the ground that \u201cthere was in any event no proven\nprejudice to\u201d the defendant). See also Queen v. Partak,\n[2001] 160 C. C. C. 3d 553 (Ont. Super. Ct. of J.)

S. ____ (2006)           15\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n  The Government also points out that the Executive\nBranch\u2019s interpretation of treaty provisions is entitled to\n\u201cgreat weight.\u201d Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. v. Avagli\nano, 457 U. S. 176, 184\u2013185 (1982). I agree with this\npresumption. But the Executive\u2019s views on our treaty\nobligations are \u201cnot conclusive.\u201d Ibid.; see Perkins v. Elg,\n307 U. S. 325, 328, 337\u2013342 (1939) (declining to adopt\nExecutive\u2019s treaty interpretation); Johnson v. Browne, 205\nU. S. 309, 319\u2013321 (1907) (same); De Lima v. Bidwell, 182\nU. S. 1, 181, 194\u2013199 (1901) (same). Where language, the\nnature of the right, and the ICJ\u2019s interpretation of the\ntreaty taken separately or together so strongly point to an\nintent to confer enforceable rights upon an individual, I\ncannot find in the simple fact of the Executive Branch\u2019s\ncontrary view sufficient reason to adopt the Government\u2019s\ninterpretation of the Convention.\n  Accordingly, I would allow the petitioners to raise their\nclaims based on violations of the Convention in their\nrespective state-court proceedings.\n                               III\n   The more difficult issue, I believe, concerns the nature\nof the Convention\u2019s requirements as to remedy. In par\nticular, Bustillo\u2019s case concerns a state procedural default\nrule. When, if ever, does the Convention require a state\ncourt to set aside such a rule in order to hear a criminal\ndefendant\u2019s claim that the police did not \u201cinform\u201d him of\nhis \u201cright\u201d to communicate with his \u201cconsular post\u201d? Art.\n36(1)(b), 21 U. S. T., at 101. The Court says that the\nanswer is \u201cnever.\u201d See ante, at 15\u201325. In its view, the\nConvention does not under any circumstances trump a\nState\u2019s ordinary procedural rules requiring a defendant to\nassert his claims at trial or lose them forever.\n   In my view, Article 36 of the Convention requires a less\nabsolute answer. Article 36 says that the rights it sets\nforth \u201cshall be exercised in conformity with the laws and\n16              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nregulations of the receiving State,\u201d but it instantly adds,\n\u201csubject to the proviso . . . that the said laws and regula\ntions must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for\nwhich the [Article 36] rights are . . . intended.\u201d Art. 36(2),\n21 U. S. T., at 101 (emphasis added). The proviso means\nthat a State\u2019s ordinary procedural default rules apply\nunless (1) the defendant\u2019s failure to raise a Convention\nmatter (e.g., that police failed to inform him of his Article\n36 rights) can itself be traced to the failure of the police (or\nother governmental authorities) to inform the defendant of\nthose Convention rights, and (2) state law does not pro\nvide any other effective way for the defendant to raise that\nissue (say, through a claim of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel).\n   Several considerations lead to this conclusion. First, as\nI have just noted, Article 36 says both that its rights \u201cshall\nbe exercised in conformity with\u201d the host country\u2019s \u201claws\nand regulations\u201d and that those \u201claws and regulations\nmust enable full effect to be given\u201d to the purposes for\nwhich those rights \u201care intended.\u201d This interpretation\nmakes both the \u201cconformity\u201d requirement and the \u201cfull\neffect\u201d requirement meaningful.\n   Second, the Convention\u2019s drafting history supports this\ninterpretation. The first draft of the Vienna Convention\nwas written by the International Law Commission.

Doc.\nA/CONF.25/16, \u00b626, p. 38 (1963) (statement of Romania).\nSee also id., at \u00b630, p. 38\u201339 (statement of Congo, Leo\npoldville) (amendment \u201cimplied the revision of certain\nlaws or regulations, which it would be difficult to carry out\nin practice\u201d); id., 12th mtg., \u00b64, at 40 (statement of Union\nof Soviet Socialist Republics) (rejecting the amendment\nbecause it would \u201cforce [signatories] to alter their criminal\nlaws and regulations\u201d); id., 20th mtg., \u00b681, at 84 (state\nment of Romania) (same); id., \u00b695, at 86 (statement of\nCzechoslovakia) (same).\n  Based on this objection, the Soviet Union proposed\nreverting to the original language. The United Kingdom\nopposed that measure, explaining that it supported the\n\u201cfull effect\u201d version because the initial (\u201cnot nullify\u201d)\nversion\n     \u201cmeant that the laws and regulations of the receiving\n     State would govern the rights specified . . . provided\n     that they did not render those rights completely inop\n     erative\u2014for \u2018to nullify\u2019 meant to \u2018render completely\n     inoperative.\u2019 But rights could be seriously impaired\n     without becoming completely inoperative. . . . Consu\n     lar officials should, of course, comply with the laws\n     and regulations of the receiving State in such matters\n     as the times for visiting prisoners, but it was most\n     important that the substance of the rights and obliga\n     tions specified . . . should be preserved.\u201d Id., \u00b6\u00b66\u20137, at\n     40.\nNo one disagreed with the United Kingdom\u2019s understand\ning of the words \u201cfull effect.\u201d And with that understand\ning, the delegates voted down the Soviet Union\u2019s proposal\nto revert to the original language, and ultimately adopted\nthe provision with the words \u201cfull effect.\u201d Id., \u00b6109, at 87.\nAs so enacted, the provision reflects the \u201cessential princi\n18              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nple of international law . . . \u2018that reparation must, as far as\npossible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act\nand reestablish the situation which would, in all probabil\nity, have existed if that act had not been committed.\u2019 \u201d 2\nRestatement \u00a7901, at 343.\n   Third, the decisions of the ICJ, fairly read, interpret the\nConvention similarly. In LaGrand and Avena, the ICJ\nread the Convention as authorizing an individual foreign\nnational to raise an Article 36 violation at trial or in a\npostconviction proceeding. See Avena, 2004 I. C. J., \u00b6121;\nLaGrand, 2001 I. C. J., at 32\u201333, \u00b6125. The ICJ added\nthat the Convention requires member states to provide\n\u201ceffective\u201d remedies in their courts for Convention viola\ntions. See Avena, supra, \u00b6138. And the ICJ made two\ncritical statements in respect to procedural default rules.\nIn LaGrand, the court said that in \u201citself, the [procedural\ndefault] rule does not violate Article 36 of the Vienna\nConvention.\u201d 2001 I. C. J., at 22, \u00b690 (emphasis added).\nRather, the \u201cproblem arises when the procedural default\nrule does not allow the detained individual to challenge a\nconviction and sentence by claiming . . . that the compe\ntent national authorities failed to comply with their obli\ngation to provide the requisite consular information \u2018with\nout delay.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. And the ICJ later specified that the\nConvention forbids American States to apply a procedural\ndefault rule to bar assertion of a Convention violation\nclaim \u201cwhere it has been the failure of the United States [or\nof a State] itself to inform that may have precluded counsel\nfrom being in a position to have raised the question of a\nviolation of the Vienna Convention in the initial trial.\u201d\nAvena, 2004 I. C. J., \u00b6113 (emphasis added).\n   This last statement indicates that the ICJ understood\nthe Convention to prevent application of a procedural\ndefault rule only where the arresting authorities\u2019 failure to\ninform the foreign national of his Convention rights\nbrought about the procedural default in the first place.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           19\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nTaken together, the above statements make clear that the\nICJ read the Convention simply to require an effective\nremedy. It stated repeatedly that it did not dictate what\nthat remedy would be, as long it was offered as part of the\n\u201cjudicial process.\u201d Id., \u00b6140\u2013141. Hence, if the State\nprovides some other effective remedy, for example, review\nfor prejudice through a claim of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel, then the Convention would not forbid application\nof ordinary procedural default rules. See ABA Guidelines\nfor the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel\nin Death Penalty Cases 10.6 (Rev. ed. 2003) (discussing\ndefense counsel\u2019s obligation to seek consular assistance);\nValdez v. Oklahoma, 46 P. 3d 703, 710 (Okla. Crim. App.\n2002) (granting postconviction relief to a defendant who\nhad failed to raise a Vienna Convention violation at trial,\nbecause he showed that his lawyer \u201ccould have obtained\nfinancial, legal and investigative assistance from his\nconsulate\u201d that would have produced important new evi\ndence); see also Ledezma v. State, 626 N. W. 2d 134, 152\n(Iowa 2001) (concluding that \u201call criminal defense attor\nneys representing foreign nationals should be aware of the\nright to consular access as provided by Article 36, and\nshould advise their clients of this right\u201d because local\ncounsel \u201care not equipped to provide the same services as\nthe local consulate\u201d); cf. Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374\n(2005).\n   I will assume that the ICJ\u2019s interpretation does not bind\nthis Court in this case. Statute of the International Court\nof Justice, Art. 59, 59 Stat. 1062, T. S. No. 993 (1945) (ICJ\ndecisions have \u201cbinding force\u201d only \u201cbetween the parties\nand in respect of that particular case\u201d). But as the major\nity points out, the ICJ\u2019s decisions on this issue nonetheless\nwarrant our \u201c \u2018respectful consideration.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 21.\nThat \u201crespectful consideration\u201d reflects the understanding\nthat uniformity is an important goal of treaty interpreta\ntion. See Olympic Airways v. Husain, 540 U. S. 644, 660\n20             SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(2004) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (\u201c[I]t is reasonable to im\npute to the parties an intent that their respective courts\nstrive to interpret the treaty consistently\u201d). And the ICJ\u2019s\nposition as an international court specifically charged with\nthe duty to interpret numerous international treaties\n(including the Convention) provides a natural point of\nreference for national courts seeking that uniformity. See\nCounter-Memorial of the United States in Avena, 2004\nI. C. J. No. 128, p. 61, n. 128 (Nov. 3, 2003) (even if ICJ\ndecision binds only in particular case, \u201cit is well-settled\u201d\nthat an ICJ decision \u201cmay serve as authority beyond a\nparticular case\u201d; citing authorities); Ordonez & Reilly,\nEffect of the Jurisprudence of the International Court of\nJustice on National Courts, in International Law Deci\nsions in National Courts 335, 365 (T.

S. ____ (2006)           23\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nand history, but also with the ICJ\u2019s interpretation of the\nsame treaty provision. In creating this last-mentioned\nconflict, as far as I can tell, the Court\u2019s decision is un\nprecedented.\n   The Court supports its interpretation in three basic\nways. First, the majority says that \u201crespectful considera\ntion\u201d does not require us to agree with a decision that is\nclearly wrong. And, it says, the ICJ\u2019s decision is clearly\nwrong. The ICJ\u2019s interpretation of Article 36, the major\nity says, would permit a Convention violation claim to\n\u201ctrump not only procedural default rules, but any number\nof other rules requiring parties to present their legal\nclaims at the appropriate time for adjudication.\u201d Ante, at\n22. That interpretation, it adds, \u201coverlooks the impor\ntance of procedural default rules in an adversary system,\u201d\nand is \u201cinconsistent with the basic framework\u201d of that\n\u201csystem.\u201d Ante, at 21\u201322.\n   The majority\u2019s argument, however, overlooks what the\nICJ actually said, overstates what it actually meant, and\nis inconsistent with what it actually did. In Avena and\nLaGrand, the ICJ did not say that the Convention neces\nsarily trumps any, let alone all, procedural rules that\nwould otherwise bar assertion of a Convention violation\nclaim. Nor did it say that the Convention necessarily\ntrumps all procedural default rules. Rather, it said that\nthe Convention prohibits application of those rules to a\nConvention violation claim only \u201cwhere it has been the\nfailure of the United States [or of a State] itself to inform\nthat may have precluded counsel from being in a position\nto have raised the question of a violation of the Vienna\nConvention in the initial trial.\u201d Avena, 2004 I. C. J., \u00b6113\n(emphasis added). Thus, Article 36(2) precludes proce\ndural default only where the defendant\u2019s failure to bring\nhis claim sooner is the result of the underlying violation.\nSince procedural default rules themselves typically excuse\ndefaults where a defendant shows \u201ccause and prejudice,\u201d it\n24             SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nis difficult to see how this statement \u201coverlooks the impor\ntance of procedural default rules in an adversary system,\u201d\nor is \u201cinconsistent with the basic framework\u201d of that\n\u201csystem.\u201d\n   Moreover, Avena and LaGrand make clear what the\nICJ\u2019s language taken in context means: The Convention\nrequires effective national remedies; hence local proce\ndural rules must give way (to the Convention\u2019s \u201cfull effect\u201d\nrequirement) when, but only when, it is the failure of the\narresting authorities to inform the defendant of his Con\nvention rights that prevented the defendant from bringing\nhis claim sooner. The opinions nowhere suggest that a\nState must provide a procedural remedy to a defendant\nwho, for example, sleeps on his rights.\n   Consider, too, what the ICJ did in Avena, a case that\nclarified the court\u2019s earlier LaGrand opinion. It did not\nhold that American courts must ignore their procedural\ndefault rules in each of the 54 individual cases at issue.\nRather, it held that domestic courts must provide \u201creview\nand reconsideration\u201d in each case. Avena, 2004 I. C. J.,\n\u00b6153(9). It nowhere forbids a state court conducting such a\n\u201creview\u201d to bar claims not timely made provided that the\nviolation did not itself cause the delay. See id., \u00b6139.\n   Perhaps the ICJ\u2019s opinions are open to different inter\npretations. But how does reading those opinions as creat\ning an extreme rule of law, as reflecting a lack of under\nstanding of the \u201cadversary system,\u201d show \u201crespectful\nconsideration\u201d? To show that kind of respect, we must\nread the opinions in light of the Convention\u2019s underlying\nlanguage and purposes and ask whether, or to what ex\ntent, they require modification of a State\u2019s ordinary proce\ndural rules. See Art. 36(2), 21 U. S.

Instead, as I have explained, see supra, at\n18\u201319, 23, Avena says only that Article 36(2) requires a\nstate court to excuse a procedural default rule where the\nState failed to inform the defendant of his consular access\nrights, and the defendant was not aware of those rights,\nand the State is unwilling to provide some other effective\nremedy, for example (if the lawyer acts incompetently in\nrespect to Convention rights of which the lawyer was\naware) an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. The\nCourt\u2019s reluctance to give LaGrand and Avena this per\nfectly reasonable interpretation reflects a failure to pro\nvide in practice the \u201crespectful consideration\u201d that we all\nbelieve the law demands.\n   The Court also relies on Breard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371\n(1998) (per curiam). In that case a foreign national, claim\ning a Convention violation, sought federal habeas corpus.\nThis Court upheld a denial of relief on the ground that the\nlower courts had correctly found that Breard procedurally\ndefaulted his Convention violation claim by failing to\ntimely raise it in his state-court proceedings. In reaching\nits conclusion, the Court rejected Breard\u2019s claim that the\nConvention trumped the procedural default rule. Its\nreasons were (1) that \u201cit has been recognized in interna\ntional law that, absent a clear and express statement to\nthe contrary, the procedural rules of the forum State\ngovern the implementation of the treaty in that State,\u201d id.,\nat 375; (2) that this principle is \u201cembodied in the Vienna\nConvention itself, which provides that the rights ex\npressed in the Convention \u2018shall be exercised in conformity\nwith the laws and regulations of the receiving State,\u2019 \u201d\nibid.; and (3) that the federal procedural default rule, as a\nlater-in-time federal statute, superseded any inconsistent\n26              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nprovision in the Convention, id., at 376.\n    I do not believe that Breard controls the outcome of\nthese cases. With respect to the third ground for the\nCourt\u2019s decision, Breard concerned a federal, rather than\n(as in Bustillo\u2019s case) a state, procedural default rule.\nThose different kinds of rules are treated differently under\nthe Supremacy Clause. See ibid. (applying the rule that\n\u201c \u2018an Act of Congress . . . is on a full parity with a treaty,\nand . . . when a statute which is subsequent in time is\ninconsistent with a treaty, the statute to the extent of\nconflict renders the treaty null\u2019 \u201d). Contrary to JUSTICE\nGINSBURG\u2019s view, then, ante, at 4, there is no anomaly in\ntreating state law differently from federal law for these\npurposes, if Congress chooses to enact legislation binding\nonly the federal government in respect to a matter covered\nby a treaty that binds both the federal government and\nthe States. Therefore, reading the Convention to require\nthe state courts to set aside Virginia\u2019s procedural default\nrule in Bustillo\u2019s case (assuming for argument\u2019s sake that\nhis case meets the criteria I have described, see supra, at\n15\u201316) would not call into question, let alone overrule,\n\u201cBreard\u2019s plain holding that the Convention does not\ntrump the [federal] procedural default doctrine,\u201d ante, at\n18, n. 4 (opinion of the Court), even if that ruling on its\nown terms is still good law after Avena and LaGrand.\n    Moreover, the ICJ decided Avena and LaGrand after\nthis Court decided Breard. And it is not difficult to recon\ncile those cases with Breard because they do not directly\nconflict with Breard\u2019s result. Rather, they interpret Arti\ncle 36(2) to require state procedural default rules some\ntimes to give way to the Convention, namely, when those\nrules prevent effective remedy by barring assertion of a\nclaim because of a delay caused by the Convention viola\ntion itself. I would read Breard as consistent with this\ninterpretation, i.e., as not saying that the Convention\nnever trumps any procedural default rule.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

In fact, our opinions are entitled to far\nmore than respectful consideration; they are entitled to\nfull stare decisis effect. But, as I have explained, reading\nBreard not to decide the outcome in this case would nei\nther overrule Breard\u2019s holding, nor reject outright its\nreading of the Convention. And, in any event, as a matter\nof the law of stare decisis, a modified reading of Breard is\nappropriate in light of the fact that the ICJ\u2019s later deci\nsions amount to a \u201csignificant . . . subsequent develop\nment\u201d of the law sufficient to lead to a reconsideration of\npast precedent.

Indeed, the Court seems to recognize as much, in\nthat it spends a full six pages explaining why the ICJ\u2019s\ninterpretation of the Convention is incorrect, see ante, at\n18\u201324, rather than simply rejecting Bustillo\u2019s argument on\nthe ground that \u201c \u2018respectful consideration\u2019 of precedent\nshould begin at home.\u201d Ante, at 18, n. 4.\n   And there are other reasons not to place too much reli\nance on the breadth of Breard\u2019s language.

But \u201c[a] treaty is in its\nnature a contract between two nations,\u201d Foster, 2 Pet., at\n314, and nations are of course free to agree to grant one\nanother\u2019s citizens protections that differ from the protec\ntions enjoyed by citizens at home, particularly when cir\ncumstances call for differential treatment. See infra, at\n30.\n   In sum, I find strong reasons for interpreting the Con\nvention as sometimes prohibiting a state court from apply\ning its ordinarily procedural default rule to a Convention\nviolation claim. The fact that the ICJ reached a similar\nconclusion in LaGrand and Avena adds strength to those\nreasons. And I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s argu\nments to the contrary.\n   Consequently, I would remand No. 05\u201351 so that Busti\nllo can argue to the Virginia state courts that they should\nmodify their ordinary procedural default requirements. I\nwould leave it to the state courts to determine in the first\ninstance whether state law has provided Bustillo the\neffective remedy that the Convention requires and how it\nhas done so (whether through \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d excep\ntions, ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims, or other\nways). Cf. LaGrand, 2001 I. C. J., at 33, \u00b6125 (the \u201cchoice\nof [implementing] means must be left to the United\nStates\u201d).\n                              IV\n  The final question presented asks whether a Convention\nviolation \u201cresult[s] in the suppression\u201d of the evidence, say\na confession, that a foreign national provided police before\nbeing informed of his Convention rights. Pet. for Cert. in\nNo. 04\u201310566, p. i. The majority answers in absolute\nterms, stating that \u201csuppression is not an appropriate\nremedy for a violation of the Convention.\u201d See ante, at 2.\nI agree with the majority insofar as it rejects the argu\n30             SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nment that the Convention creates a Miranda-style \u201cauto\nmatic exclusionary rule.\u201d Ante, at 8; see also Miranda,\n384 U. S., at 471; cf., e.g., Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643\n(1961); Franks v. Delaware, 438 U. S. 154 (1978). But I do\nnot agree with the absolute nature of its statement.\nRather, sometimes suppression could prove the only effec\ntive remedy. And, if that is so, then the Convention,\nwhich insists upon effective remedies, would require sup\npression in an appropriate case. Art. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at\n101.\n   Much depends upon the circumstances. It may be true\nthat in \u201cmost circumstances, there is likely to be little\nconnection between an Article 36 violation and evidence or\nstatements obtained by police.\u201d Ante, at 14. Miranda\nsurely helps, for it guarantees that police will inform an\narrested foreign national of his right to contact a lawyer.\nBut one cannot guarantee in advance that Miranda will\nadequately cure every seriously prejudicial failure to in\nform an arrested person of his right to contact his consular\npost. One can imagine a case, for example, involving a\nforeign national who speaks little English, who comes from\na country where confessions made to the police cannot be\nused in court as evidence, who does not understand that a\nstate-provided lawyer can provide him crucial assistance in\nan interrogation, and whose native community has great\nfear of police abuse. Indeed, Sanchez-Llamas made allega\ntions similar to these in his case. Brief for Petitioner San\nchez-Llamas 5-7; see also Brief for the Government of the\nUnited Mexican States as Amicus Curiae 10.\n   While JUSTICE GINSBURG is correct that a defendant\nwho is prejudiced under the Convention may be able to\nshow that his confession is involuntary under Miranda,\nante, at 2, I am not persuaded that this will always be so.\nA person who fully understands his Miranda rights but\ndoes not fully understand the implications of these rights\nfor our legal system may or may not be able to show that\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          31\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhis confession was involuntary under Miranda, but he will\ncertainly have a claim under the Vienna Convention. In\nsuch a case suppression of a confession may prove the only\neffective remedy. I would not rule out the existence of\nsuch cases in advance.\n  Furthermore, the majority is wrong to say that it would\n\u201cbe startling if the Convention were read to require sup\npression\u201d in such cases because suppression \u201cis an entirely\nAmerican legal creation.\u201d Ante, at 8 (opinion of the Court).\nI put to the side the fact that \u201csuppression\u201d is in origin a\nBritish, not an American, remedy. See Dickerson v.\nUnited States, 530 U. S. 428, 433 (2000) (noting that \u201cthe\nroots of the [Miranda] test developed in the common law\u201d\nand citing English cases); see also King v. Warickshall, 1\nLeach 262, 263\u2013264, 168 Eng. Rep. 234, 235 (K. B. 1783)\n(coerced confessions are inadmissible in British courts).\nRegardless, it is not \u201cstartling\u201d to read the Convention as\nsometimes requiring suppression. That is because those\nwho wrote the Convention were fully aware that the crimi\nnal justice systems of different nations differ in important\nways. They did not list particular remedies. They used\ngeneral language. That language requires every member\nnation to give \u201cfull effect\u201d to Article 36(1)\u2019s \u201cpurposes.\u201d\nArt. 36(2), 21 U. S. T., at 101. That language leaves it up\nto each nation to determine how to implement Article\n36(1)\u2019s requirements. Avena, 2004 I. C. J., \u00b6127; LaGrand,\nsupra, at 32\u201333, \u00b6125. But as a matter of logic and pur\npose that language must also insist upon the use of sup\npression if and when there are circumstances in which\nsuppression provides the only effective remedy.\n  These differences may also help to explain what the\nmajority says is the disturbing circumstance that \u201cnearly\nall\u201d other signatories to the Convention \u201crefuse to recog\nnize\u201d suppression \u201cas a matter of domestic law,\u201d and there\nfore that \u201cSanchez-Llamas would [not] be afforded the\nrelief he seeks here in any of the other 169 countries party\n32             SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v. OREGON\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nto the Vienna Convention.\u201d Ante, at 9. In fact, there are\nseveral cases from common-law jurisdictions suggesting\nthat suppression is an appropriate remedy for a Conven\ntion violation. See, e.g., Tan Seng Kiah v. Queen (2001)\n160 F. L. R. 26 (Ct. Crim. App. N. Terr.) (Australian case\nsuppressing confession obtained in violation of statute\nrequiring police to notify defendant of right to contact\nconsulate upon arrest); Queen v. Tan [2001] W. A. S. C.\n275 (Sup. Ct. W. Australia in Crim.) (Australian case\nconsidering but declining to suppress evidence based on\nviolation of same statute); Regina v. Partak, 160 C. C. C.\n3d, at \u00b663 (Canada) (concluding that suppression is inap\npropriate, not because it was never a proper remedy under\nthe Vienna Convention but because the defendant \u201ccom\npletely failed to demonstrate any prejudice arising from\nthe failure of the police to notify him of his consular\nrights\u201d).\n   I concede the absence of such cases from civil law juris\ndictions. But the criminal justice systems in those nations\ndiffer from our own in significant ways. Civil-law nations,\nfor example, typically rely more heavily than do we upon\njudicial investigation, questioning by a neutral magistrate,\nthe compiling of all evidence into a dossier, and later\nreview of that dossier at trial by judges who may sit with\nout our type of jury. In such a system, formal suppression\nproceedings may prove less frequent. Judges, as a matter\nof practice, may simply disregard improperly obtained\nevidence, they may discount the significance of that evi\ndence, or they may adjust the nature of future proceedings\nor even the final sentence accordingly.

The\nexistence of cases in such nations where a court denies a\ndefense request to suppress, of course, might well shed\nlight on that nation\u2019s readiness to provide an effective\nremedy. The Solicitor General cites one (and only one)\nsuch case.

OREGON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsomehow the petitioners here are asking the United States\nto provide that which other countries deny, an effective\nremedy.\n                               V\n   The United States joined the Vienna Convention, and\nurged other nations to join, in order to promote \u201cthe or\nderly and effective conduct of consular relations between\nStates,\u201d and to guarantee \u201cthe protection of our citizens\nabroad.\u201d Vienna Convention on Consular Relations with\nOptional Protocol, S. Exec. Doc. No. E, 91st Cong., 1st\nSess., 60, 75 (1969). In doing so, the United States, along\nwith the other 169 nations that ratified the Convention,\nundertook a complex task. They sought not only to protect\ntheir consular posts, but also to assure that their nationals\nwould have access to those posts when arrested abroad.\nBut how to enforce those rights poses a difficult question\nbecause the enforcement mechanism inevitably will vary\ndepending upon the details of a nation\u2019s legal system. For\npractical, legal, and political, reasons, it is difficult to\nwrite enforcement details into an international treaty.\nYet without any such guarantees it may prove difficult to\nprevent an individual nation, through application of its\nsystem\u2019s details, from denying in practice the rights that\nthe treaty sought to assure.\n   The Convention deals with this problem by including a\ngeneral provision that both severely limits the treaty\u2019s\nintrusion into the functioning of a domestic legal system\nand also safeguards consular access rights from serious\ndomestic neglect. It does so by stating that those rights\nshall \u201cbe exercised in conformity with the laws and regula\ntions of the receiving State,\u201d provided that those laws and\nregulations give \u201cfull effect\u201d to Article 36(1)\u2019s purposes.\nArt. 36(2), 21 U.

That is why I believe that the Convention here\nrequires individual States to make an exception (akin to a\n\u201ccause and prejudice\u201d exception) to a state procedural\ndefault rule if (1) the defendant\u2019s failure to raise a claim of\na Convention violation in a timely manner itself was a\nproduct of that violation, and (2) state law provides no\nother procedural means through which the State\u2019s courts\ncan provide \u201creview,\u201d \u201creconsideration,\u201d and effective\nrelief. Similarly, I would hold that whether the Conven\ntion requires a state court to suppress a confession ob\ntained after an Article 36 violation depends on whether\nsuppression is the only remedy available that will effec\ntively cure related prejudice. And because neither state\ncourt applied this standard below, I would remand each\ncase for that initial consideration. See 338 Ore., at 269,\n108 P. 3d, at 574 (rejecting Sanchez-Llamas\u2019 request for\nsuppression remedy solely on the ground that the Conven\ntion \u201cdoes not create rights that individual foreign nation\nals may assert in a criminal proceeding\u201d); App. to Pet. for\nCert. 47a (rejecting Bustillo\u2019s request for state postconvic\ntion relief based on a standard different from that set forth\nhere).\n   The interpretation of the Convention that I would adopt\nis consistent with the ICJ\u2019s own interpretation and should\nnot impose significant new burdens upon state criminal\njustice systems. America\u2019s legal traditions have long\nincluded detailed rules for discovering and curing prejudi\ncial legal errors. Indeed, many States already have \u201ccause\nand prejudice\u201d exceptions likely broad enough to provide\nthe \u201ceffective\u201d relief the Convention demands. And, in any\nevent, it leaves the States free to apply their own judicial\nremedies in light of, and bounded by, the Convention\u2019s\ngeneral instructions.\n   The Court, I fear, does not rise to the interpretive chal\n36              SANCHEZ-LLAMAS v.

Rather than seek to apply Article 36\u2019s language\nand purposes to the federal/state relationships that char\nacterize America\u2019s legal system, it simply rejects the no\ntion that Article 36(2) sets forth any relevant requirement.\nThat approach leaves States free to deny effective relief for\nConvention violations, despite America\u2019s promise to pro\nvide just such relief. That approach risks weakening\nrespect abroad for the rights of foreign nationals, a respect\nthat America, in 1969, sought to make effective through\nout the world.
