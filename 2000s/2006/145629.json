MURPHY ET VIR. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 05\u201318. Argued April 19, 2006\u2014Decided June 26, 2006\nAfter respondents prevailed in their Individuals with Disabilities Edu\n  cation Act (IDEA) action to require petitioner school board to pay for\n  their son\u2019s private school tuition, they sought fees for services ren\n  dered by an educational consultant during the proceedings, relying\n  on an IDEA provision that permits a court to \u201caward reasonable at\n  torneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u201d to prevailing parents, 20 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71415(i)(3)(B). The District Court granted their motion in part. Af\n  firming, the Second Circuit noted that, under Crawford Fitting Co. v.\n  J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437, and West Virginia Univ. Hospitals,\n  Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83, a cost- or fee-shifting provision will not be\n  read to permit recovery of expert fees without explicit statutory au\n  thority, but concluded that a congressional Conference Committee\n  Report relating to \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) and a footnote in Casey referencing\n  that Report showed that the IDEA authorized such reimbursement.\nHeld: Section \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) does not authorize prevailing parents to\n recover expert fees. Pp. 3\u201312.\n    (a) The resolution of this question is guided by the fact that Con\n gress enacted the IDEA pursuant to the Spending Clause. While\n Congress has broad power to set the terms on which it disburses fed\n eral money to the States, any conditions it attaches to a State\u2019s ac\n ceptance of such funds must be set out \u201cunambiguously.\u201d Pennhurst\n State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17. Fund re\n cipients are bound only by those conditions that they accept \u201cvolun\n tarily and knowingly,\u201d ibid., and States cannot knowingly accept con\n ditions of which they are \u201cunaware\u201d or which they are \u201cunable to\n ascertain,\u201d ibid. Thus, the question here is whether the IDEA fur\n nishes clear notice regarding expert fees. Pp. 3\u20134.\n2         ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                          MURPHY                                                  \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n       (b) The Court begins with the IDEA\u2019s text, for if its \u201clanguage is\n    plain,\u201d the courts\u2019 function \u201c \u2018 \u201cis to enforce it according to its terms.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n    Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union Planters Bank, N. A., 530\n    U. S. 1, 6. While \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) provides for an award of \u201creasonable\n    attorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d it does not even hint that acceptance of IDEA funds\n    makes a State responsible for reimbursing prevailing parents for the\n    services of experts. \u201cCosts\u201d is a term of art that does not generally\n    include expert fees. The use of \u201ccosts\u201d rather than \u201cexpenses\u201d\n    strongly suggests that \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) was not meant to be an open-\n    ended provision making States liable for all expenses. Moreover,\n    \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) says not that a court may award \u201ccosts\u201d but that it may\n    award attorney\u2019s fees \u201cas part of the costs.\u201d This language simply\n    adds reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the list of recoverable costs set out\n    in 28 U. S. C. \u00a71920, the general statute covering taxation of costs,\n    which is strictly limited by \u00a71821. Thus, \u00a71415(i)(3)(B)\u2019s text does not\n    authorize an award of additional expert fees, and it certainly fails to\n    present the clear notice required by the Spending Clause. Other\n    IDEA provisions point strongly in the same direction. Of little sig\n    nificance here is a provision in the Handicapped Children\u2019s Protec\n    tion Act of 1986 requiring the General Accounting Office to collect\n    data on awards to prevailing parties in IDEA cases, but making no\n    mention of consultants or experts or their fees. And the fact that the\n    provision directed the GAO to compile data on the hours spent by\n    consultants in IDEA cases does not mean that Congress intended for\n    States to compensate prevailing parties for fees billed by these con\n    sultants. Pp. 4\u20138.\n       (c) Crawford Fitting Co. and Casey strongly reinforce the conclu\n    sion that the IDEA does not unambiguously authorize prevailing\n    parents to recover expert fees. Crawford Fitting Co.\u2019s reasoning sup\n    ports the conclusion that the term \u201ccosts\u201d in \u00a71415(i)(3)(B), like\n    \u201ccosts\u201d in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d), the provision at issue\n    there, is defined by the categories of expenses enumerated in 28\n    U. S. C. \u00a71920. This conclusion is buttressed by the principle, recog\n    nized in Crawford Fitting Co., that no statute will be construed to au\n    thorize taxing witness fees as costs unless the statute \u201crefer[s] explic\n    itly to witness fees.\u201d 482 U. S., at 445. The conclusion that the IDEA\n    does not authorize expert fee awards is confirmed even more dra\n    matically by Casey, where the Court held that 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988, a\n    fee-shifting provision with wording virtually identical to that of 20\n    U. S. C. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B), did not empower a district court to award ex\n    pert fees to a prevailing party. 482 U. S., at 102. The Second Circuit\n    misunderstood the meaning of the Casey footnote on which it relied.\n    That footnote did not state that the Conference Committee Report set\n    out the correct interpretation of \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) or provided the clear\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

Its thrust was simply\n  that \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d standing alone, is generally not understood as\n  encompassing expert fees. Pp. 8\u201311.\n    (d) Respondents\u2019 additional arguments are unpersuasive. The\n  IDEA\u2019s goals of \u201censur[ing] that all children with disabilities have\n  available to them a free appropriate public education,\u201d\n  \u00a71400(d)(1)(A), and of safeguarding parents\u2019 right to challenge ad\n  verse school decisions are too general to provide much support for\n  their reading of the IDEA. And the IDEA\u2019s legislative history is in\n  sufficient help, where everything other than that history overwhelm\n  ingly suggests that expert fees may not be recovered.

S. C.\n\u00a71415(i)(3)(B). We granted certiorari to decide whether\nthis fee-shifting provision authorizes prevailing parents to\nrecover fees for services rendered by experts in IDEA\nactions. We hold that it does not.\n                             I\n  Respondents Pearl and Theodore Murphy filed an action\nunder the IDEA on behalf of their son, Joseph Murphy,\nseeking to require petitioner Arlington Central School\nDistrict Board of Education to pay for their son\u2019s private\nschool tuition for specified school years. Respondents\nprevailed in the District Court, 86 F. Supp. 2d 354 (SDNY\n2000), and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\naffirmed, 297 F. 3d 195 (2002).\n  As prevailing parents, respondents then sought $29,350\nin fees for the services of an educational consultant,\n2     ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                      MURPHY                                  \n\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\nMarilyn Arons, who assisted respondents throughout the\nIDEA proceedings. The District Court granted respon\ndents\u2019 request in part. It held that only the value of Arons\u2019\ntime spent between the hearing request and the ruling in\nrespondents\u2019 favor could properly be considered charges\nincurred in an \u201caction or proceeding brought\u201d under the\nAct, see 20 U. S. C. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B). 2003 WL 21694398, *9\n(SDNY, July 22, 2003). This reduced the maximum recov\nery to $8,650. The District Court also held that Arons, a\nnonlawyer, could be compensated only for time spent on\nexpert consulting services, not for time spent on legal\nrepresentation, id., at *4, but it concluded that all the\nrelevant time could be characterized as falling within the\ncompensable category, and thus allowed compensation for\nthe full $8,650, id., at *10.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.\n402 F. 3d 332 (2005). Acknowledging that other Circuits\nhad taken the opposite view, the Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit held that \u201cCongress intended to and did\nauthorize the reimbursement of expert fees in IDEA ac\ntions.\u201d Id., at 336. The court began by discussing two\ndecisions of this Court holding that expert fees could not\nbe recovered as taxed costs under particular cost- or fee-\nshifting provisions. See Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gib\nbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437 (1987) (interpreting Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 54(d) and 28 U. S. C. \u00a71920); West Virginia Univ.\nHospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83 (1991) (interpreting 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71988 (1988 ed.)). According to these decisions, the\ncourt noted, a cost- or fee-shifting provision will not be read\nto permit a prevailing party to recover expert fees without\n\u201c\u2018explicit statutory authority\u2019 indicating that Congress\nintended for that sort of fee-shifting.\u201d 402 F. 3d, at 336.\n   Ultimately, though, the court was persuaded by a state\nment in the Conference Committee Report relating to 20\nU. S. C. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) and by a footnote in Casey that\nmade reference to that Report. 402 F. 3d, at 336\u2013337\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

Based on\nthese authorities, the court concluded that it was required\nto interpret the IDEA to authorize the award of the costs\nthat prevailing parents incur in hiring experts. 402 F. 3d,\nat 336.\n   We granted certiorari, 546 U. S. ____ (2006), to resolve\nthe conflict among the Circuits with respect to whether\nCongress authorized the compensation of expert fees to\nprevailing parents in IDEA actions. Compare Goldring v.\nDistrict of Columbia, 416 F. 3d 70, 73\u201377 (CADC 2005);\nNeosho R-V School Dist. v. Clark ex rel. Clark, 315 F. 3d\n1022, 1031\u20131033 (CA8 2003); T. D. v.

We now reverse.\n                              II\n  Our resolution of the question presented in this case is\nguided by the fact that Congress enacted the IDEA pursu\nant to the Spending Clause. U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 1;\nsee Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. ____ (2005). Like its\nstatutory predecessor, the IDEA provides federal funds to\nassist state and local agencies in educating children with\ndisabilities \u201cand conditions such funding upon a State\u2019s\ncompliance with extensive goals and procedures.\u201d Board of\nEd. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester\nCty. v. Rowley, 458 U. S. 176, 179 (1982).\n  Congress has broad power to set the terms on which it\ndisburses federal money to the States, see, e.g., South\nDakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 206\u2013207 (1987), but when\nCongress attaches conditions to a State\u2019s acceptance of\nfederal funds, the conditions must be set out \u201cunambigu\nously,\u201d see Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halder\nman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981); Rowley, supra, at 204, n. 26.\n\u201c[L]egislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is\nmuch in the nature of a contract,\u201d and therefore, to be bound\nby \u201cfederally imposed conditions,\u201d recipients of federal funds\n4     ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                      MURPHY                                \n\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\nmust accept them \u201cvoluntarily and knowingly.\u201d Pennhurst,\n451 U. S., at 17. States cannot knowingly accept conditions\nof which they are \u201cunaware\u201d or which they are \u201cunable to\nascertain.\u201d Ibid. Thus, in the present case, we must view\nthe IDEA from the perspective of a state official who is\nengaged in the process of deciding whether the State should\naccept IDEA funds and the obligations that go with those\nfunds. We must ask whether such a state official would\nclearly understand that one of the obligations of the Act is\nthe obligation to compensate prevailing parents for expert\nfees. In other words, we must ask whether the IDEA\nfurnishes clear notice regarding the liability at issue in\nthis case.\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n  In considering whether the IDEA provides clear notice,\nwe begin with the text. We have \u201cstated time and again\nthat courts must presume that a legislature says in a\nstatute what it means and means in a statute what it says\nthere.\u201d Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249,\n253\u2013254 (1992). When the statutory \u201clanguage is plain, the\nsole function of the courts\u2014at least where the disposition\nrequired by the text is not absurd\u2014is to enforce it according\nto its terms.\u201d Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union\nPlanters Bank, N. A., 530 U. S. 1, 6 (2000) (quoting United\nStates v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235, 241\n(1989), in turn quoting Caminetti v. United States, 242 U. S.\n470, 485 (1917); internal quotation marks omitted).\n  The governing provision of the IDEA, 20 U. S. C.\n\u00a71415(i)(3)(B), provides that \u201c[i]n any action or proceeding\nbrought under this section, the court, in its discretion,\nmay award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u201d\nto the parents of \u201ca child with a disability\u201d who is the\n\u201cprevailing party.\u201d While this provision provides for an\naward of \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d this provision does\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot even hint that acceptance of IDEA funds makes a\nState responsible for reimbursing prevailing parents for\nservices rendered by experts.\n   Respondents contend that we should interpret the term\n\u201ccosts\u201d in accordance with its meaning in ordinary usage\nand that \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) should therefore be read to \u201cau\nthorize reimbursement of all costs parents incur in IDEA\nproceedings, including expert costs.\u201d Brief for Respon\ndents 17.\n   This argument has multiple flaws. For one thing, as the\nCourt of Appeals in this case acknowledged, \u201c \u2018costs\u2019 is a\nterm of art that generally does not include expert fees.\u201d\n402 F. 3d, at 336. The use of this term of art, rather than\na term such as \u201cexpenses,\u201d strongly suggests that\n\u00a71415(i)(3)(B) was not meant to be an open-ended provi\nsion that makes participating States liable for all expenses\nincurred by prevailing parents in connection with an\nIDEA case\u2014for example, travel and lodging expenses or\nlost wages due to time taken off from work. Moreover,\ncontrary to respondents\u2019 suggestion, \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) does\nnot say that a court may award \u201ccosts\u201d to prevailing par\nents; rather, it says that a court may award reasonable\nattorney\u2019s fees \u201cas part of the costs\u201d to prevailing parents.\nThis language simply adds reasonable attorney\u2019s fees\nincurred by prevailing parents to the list of costs that\nprevailing parents are otherwise entitled to recover. This\nlist of otherwise recoverable costs is obviously the list set\nout in 28 U. S. C. \u00a71920, the general statute governing the\ntaxation of costs in federal court, and the recovery of\nwitness fees under \u00a71920 is strictly limited by \u00a71821,\nwhich authorizes travel reimbursement and a $40 per\ndiem. Thus, the text of 20 U. S. C. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) does not\nauthorize an award of any additional expert fees, and it\ncertainly fails to provide the clear notice that is required\nunder the Spending Clause.\n   Other provisions of the IDEA point strongly in the same\n6     ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                      MURPHY                                \n\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\ndirection. While authorizing the award of reasonable\nattorney\u2019s fees, the Act contains detailed provisions that\nare designed to ensure that such awards are indeed rea\nsonable. See \u00a7\u00a71415(i)(3)(C)\u2013(G). The absence of any\ncomparable provisions relating to expert fees strongly\nsuggests that recovery of expert fees is not authorized.\nMoreover, the lack of any reference to expert fees in\n\u00a71415(d)(2) gives rise to a similar inference. This provi\nsion, which generally requires that parents receive \u201ca full\nexplanation of the procedural safeguards\u201d available under\n\u00a71415 and refers expressly to \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d makes no\nmention of expert fees.\n                               B\n   Respondents contend that their interpretation of\n\u00a71415(i)(3)(B) is supported by a provision of the Handi\ncapped Children\u2019s Protection Act of 1986 that required the\nGeneral Accounting Office (GAO) to collect certain data,\n\u00a74(b)(3), 100 Stat. 797 (hereinafter GAO study provision),\nbut this provision is of little significance for present pur\nposes. The GAO study provision directed the Comptroller\nGeneral, acting through the GAO, to compile data on,\namong other things: \u201c(A) the specific amount of attorneys\u2019\nfees, costs, and expenses awarded to the prevailing party\u201d in\nIDEA cases for a particular period of time, and (B) \u201cthe\nnumber of hours spent by personnel, including attorneys\nand consultants, involved in the action or proceeding, and\nexpenses incurred by the parents and the State educa\ntional agency and local educational agency.\u201d Id., at 797\u2013\n798.\n   Subparagraph (A) would provide some support for re\nspondents\u2019 position if it directed the GAO to compile data\non awards to prevailing parties of the expense of hiring\nconsultants, but that is not what subparagraph (A) says.\nSubparagraph (A) makes no mention of consultants or\n                      Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                       7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nexperts or their fees.1\n  Subparagraph (B) similarly does not help respondents.\nSubparagraph (B), which directs the GAO to study \u201cthe\nnumber of hours spent [in IDEA cases] by personnel,\nincluding . . . consultants,\u201d says nothing about the award\nof fees to such consultants. Just because Congress di\nrected the GAO to compile statistics on the hours spent by\nconsultants in IDEA cases, it does not follow that Con\ngress meant for States to compensate prevailing parties\nfor the fees billed by these consultants.\n  Respondents maintain that \u201cCongress\u2019 direction to the\nGAO would be inexplicable if Congress did not anticipate\nthat the expenses for \u2018consultants\u2019 would be recoverable,\u201d\nBrief for Respondents 19, but this is incorrect. There are\nmany reasons why Congress might have wanted the GAO\nto gather data on expenses that were not to be taxed as\ncosts. Knowing the costs incurred by IDEA litigants might\nbe useful in considering future procedural amendments\n(which might affect these costs) or a future amendment\nregarding fee shifting. And, in fact, it is apparent that the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Because   subparagraph (A) refers to both \u201ccosts\u201d and \u201cexpenses\u201d\nawarded to prevailing parties and because it is generally presumed that\nstatutory language is not superfluous, it could be argued that this provi\nsion manifests the expectation that prevailing parties would be awarded\ncertain \u201cexpenses\u201d not included in the list of \u201ccosts\u201d set out in 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71920 and that expert fees were intended to be among these unenumer\nated \u201cexpenses.\u201d This argument fails because, whatever expectation this\nlanguage might seem to evidence, the fact remains that neither 20 U. S. C.\n\u00a71415 nor any other provision of the IDEA authorizes the award of any\n\u201cexpenses\u201d other than \u201ccosts.\u201d Recognizing this, respondents argue not\nthat they are entitled to recover \u201cexpenses\u201d that are not \u201ccosts,\u201d but that\nexpert fees are recoverable \u201ccosts.\u201d As a result, the reference to awards of\nboth \u201cexpenses\u201d and \u201ccosts\u201d does not support respondents\u2019 position. The\nreference to \u201cexpenses\u201d may relate to IDEA actions brought in state court,\n\u00a71415(i)(2)(A), where \u201cexpenses\u201d other than \u201ccosts\u201d might be receivable.\nOr the reference may be surplusage. While it is generally presumed that\nstatutes do not contain surplusage, instances of surplusage are not\nunknown.\n8          ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                           MURPHY                                            \n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n\nGAO study provision covered expenses that could not be\ntaxed as costs. For example, the GAO was instructed to\ncompile statistics on the hours spent by all attorneys\ninvolved in an IDEA action or proceeding, even though the\nAct did not provide for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees by a\nprevailing state or local educational agency.2 Similarly,\nthe GAO was directed to compile data on \u201cexpenses in\ncurred by the parents,\u201d not just those parents who prevail\nand are thus eligible to recover taxed costs.\n  In sum, the terms of the IDEA overwhelmingly support\nthe conclusion that prevailing parents may not recover the\ncosts of experts or consultants. Certainly the terms of the\nIDEA fail to provide the clear notice that would be needed\nto attach such a condition to a State\u2019s receipt of IDEA\nfunds.\n                              IV\n   Thus far, we have considered only the text of the IDEA,\nbut perhaps the strongest support for our interpretation of\nthe IDEA is supplied by our decisions and reasoning in\nCrawford Fitting, 482 U. S. 437, and Casey, 499 U. S. 83.\nIn light of those decisions, we do not see how it can be said\nthat the IDEA gives a State unambiguous notice regarding\nliability for expert fees.\n   In Crawford Fitting, the Court rejected an argument\nvery similar to respondents\u2019 argument that the term\n\u201ccosts\u201d in \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) should be construed as an open-\nended reference to prevailing parents\u2019 expenses. It was\nargued in Crawford Fitting that Federal Rule of Civil\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 In\n      2000, the attorneys\u2019 fees provision provided only an award to\nprevailing parents. See 20 U. S. C. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B). In 2004, Congress\namended \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) to include two additional awards. See \u00a7101,\n118 Stat. 2724. The amendments provided awards \u201cto a prevailing\nparty who is a State educational agency or local educational agency\u201d\nwhere the complaint filed is frivolous or presented for an improper\npurpose, such as to harass, delay, or increase the cost of litigation. See\n20 U. S. C. A. \u00a7\u00a71415(i)(3)(B)(i)(II)\u2013(III) (Supp. 2006).\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nProcedure 54(d), which provides for the award of \u201ccosts\u201d to\na prevailing party, authorizes the award of costs not listed\nin 28 U. S. C. \u00a71821. 482 U. S., at 439. The Court held,\nhowever, that Rule 54(d) does not give a district judge\n\u201cdiscretion to tax whatever costs may seem appropriate\u201d;\nrather, the term \u201ccosts\u201d in Rule 54(d) is defined by the list\nset out in \u00a71920. Id., at 441. Because the recovery of\nwitness fees, see \u00a71920(3), is strictly limited by \u00a71821, the\nCourt observed, a broader interpretation of Rule 54(d)\nwould mean that the Rule implicitly effected a partial\nrepeal of those provisions. Id., at 442. But, the Court\nwarned, \u201c[w]e will not lightly infer that Congress has\nrepealed \u00a7\u00a71920 and 1821, either through Rule 54(d) or\nany other provision not referring explicitly to witness\nfees.\u201d Id., at 445.\n  The reasoning of Crawford Fitting strongly supports the\nconclusion that the term \u201ccosts\u201d in 20 U. S. C.\n\u00a71415(i)(3)(B), like the same term in Rule 54(d), is defined\nby the categories of expenses enumerated in 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71920. This conclusion is buttressed by the principle,\nrecognized in Crawford Fitting, that no statute will be\nconstrued as authorizing the taxation of witness fees as\ncosts unless the statute \u201crefer[s] explicitly to witness fees.\u201d\n482 U. S., at 445; see also ibid.

S. C. \u00a71821 and\n\u00a71920\u201d).\n  Our decision in Casey confirms even more dramatically\nthat the IDEA does not authorize an award of expert fees.\nIn Casey, as noted above, we interpreted a fee-shifting\nprovision, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988, the relevant wording of which\nwas virtually identical to the wording of 20 U. S. C.\n\u00a71415(i)(3)(B). Compare ibid. (authorizing the award of\n\u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u201d to prevail\ning parents) with 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988(b) (1988 ed.) (permit\n10    ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD.

Casey, supra, at\n102. To decide in favor of respondents here, we would\nhave to interpret the virtually identical language in 20\nU. S. C. \u00a71415 as having exactly the opposite meaning.\nIndeed, we would have to go further and hold that the\nrelevant language in the IDEA unambiguously means\nexactly the opposite of what the nearly identical language\nin 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988 was held to mean in Casey.\n   The Court of Appeals, as noted above, was heavily influ\nenced by a Casey footnote, see 402 F. 3d, at 336\u2013337 (quot\ning 499 U. S., at 91\u201392, n. 5), but the court misunderstood\nthe footnote\u2019s meaning. The text accompanying the foot\nnote argued, based on an analysis of several fee-shifting\nstatutes, that the term \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d does not include\nexpert fees. Id., at 88\u201391. In the footnote, we commented\non petitioners\u2019 invocation of the Conference Committee\nReport relating to 20 U. S. C. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B), which stated:\n\u201c \u2018The conferees intend[ed] that the term \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees as\npart of the costs\u201d include reasonable expenses and fees of\nexpert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or\nevaluation which is found to be necessary for the prepara\ntion of the . . . case.\u2019 \u201d 499 U.

The footnote did not\nstate that the Conference Committee Report set out the\ncorrect interpretation of \u00a71415(i)(3)(B), much less that the\nReport was sufficient, despite the language of the statute,\nto provide the clear notice required under the Spending\nClause. The thrust of the footnote was simply that the\nterm \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d standing alone, is generally not\nunderstood as encompassing expert fees.

Because the IDEA is not intended in all\ninstances to further the broad goals identified by the\nrespondents at the expense of fiscal considerations, the\ngoals cited by respondents do little to bolster their argu\nment on the narrow question presented here.3\n  Finally, respondents vigorously argue that Congress\nclearly intended for prevailing parents to be compensated\nfor expert fees. They rely on the legislative history of\n\u00a71415 and in particular on the following statement in the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Respondents note that a GAO report stated that expert witness fees\n\nare reimbursable expenses.

The Court extracts from Pennhurst State School and\nHospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981), a \u201cclear\nnotice\u201d requirement, and deems it applicable in this case\nbecause Congress enacted the Individuals with Disabili\nties Education Act (IDEA), as it did the legislation at issue\nin Pennhurst, pursuant to the Spending Clause. Ante, at\n3\u20134. That extraction, in my judgment, is unwarranted.\nPennhurst\u2019s \u201cclear notice\u201d requirement should not be\nunmoored from its context. The Court there confronted a\nplea to impose \u201can unexpected condition for compliance\u2014a\nnew [programmatic] obligation for participating States.\u201d\nBell v. New Jersey, 461 U.

Furthermore, no \u201cclear notice\u201d prop is needed\nin this case given the twin pillars on which the Court\u2019s\njudgment securely rests. First, as the Court explains,\nante, at 4\u20136, the specific, attorneys\u2019-fees-oriented, provi\nsions of IDEA, i.e., 20 U. S. C. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B)\u2013(G);\n\u00a71415(d)(2)(L), \u201coverwhelmingly support the conclusion\nthat prevailing parents may not recover the costs of ex\nperts or consultants,\u201d ante, at 8. Those provisions place\ncontrols on fees recoverable for attorneys\u2019 services, without\nmentioning costs parents might incur for other profes\nsional services and controls geared to those costs. Second,\nas the Court develops, prior decisions closely in point\n\u201cstrongly suppor[t],\u201d even \u201cconfir[m] . . . dramatically,\u201d\ntoday\u2019s holding that IDEA trains on attorneys\u2019 fees and\ndoes not authorize an award covering amounts paid or\npayable for the services of an educational consultant.\nAnte, at 9 (citing Crawford Fitting Co. v.

Unlike the Court, I believe that the word\n\u201ccosts\u201d includes, and authorizes payment of, the costs of\nexperts. The word \u201ccosts\u201d does not define its own scope.\nNeither does the phrase \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees as part of costs.\u201d\nBut Members of Congress did make clear their intent by,\namong other things, approving a Conference Report that\nspecified that \u201cthe term \u2018attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u2019\ninclude[s] reasonable expenses of expert witnesses and\nreasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to\nbe necessary for the preparation of the parent or guard\nian\u2019s case in the action or proceeding.\u201d H.

No\nSenator or Representative voiced any opposition to this\nstatement in the discussion preceding the vote on the\nConference Report\u2014the last vote on the bill before it was\nsent to the President. I can find no good reason for this\nCourt to interpret the language of this statute as meaning\nthe precise opposite of what Congress told us it intended.\n2     ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                       MURPHY                                \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\n                              I\n   There are two strong reasons for interpreting the statu\ntory phrase to include the award of expert fees. First, that\nis what Congress said it intended by the phrase. Second,\nthat interpretation furthers the IDEA\u2019s statutorily defined\npurposes.\n                              A\n   Congress added the IDEA\u2019s cost-shifting provision when\nit enacted the Handicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act of\n1986 (HCPA), 100 Stat. 796. Senator Lowell Weicker\nintroduced the relevant bill in 1985. 131 Cong. Rec. 1979\u2013\n1980 (1985). As introduced, it sought to overturn this\nCourt\u2019s determination that the then-current version of the\nIDEA (and other civil rights statutes) did not authorize\ncourts to award attorneys\u2019 fees to prevailing parents in\nIDEA cases. See Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992 (1984).\nThe bill provided that \u201c[i]n any action or proceeding\nbrought under this subsection, the court, in its discretion,\nmay award a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs\nto a parent or legal representative of a handicapped child\nor youth who is the prevailing party.\u201d 131 Cong. Rec.\n1980; see S. Rep. No. 99\u2013112, p. 2 (1985).\n   After hearings and debate, several Senators introduced\na new bill in the Senate that would have put a cap on\nattorneys\u2019 fees for legal services lawyers, but at the same\ntime would have explicitly authorized the award of \u201ca\nreasonable attorney\u2019s fee, reasonable witness fees, and\nother reasonable expenses of the civil action, in addition to\nthe costs to a parent . . . who is the prevailing party.\u201d Id.,\nat 7 (emphasis added). While no Senator objected to the\nlatter provision, some objected to the cap. See, e.g., id., at\n17\u201318 (Additional Views of Senators Kerry, Kennedy, Pell,\nDodd, Simon, Metzenbaum and Matsunaga) (accepting\ncost-shifting provision, but objecting to cap and other\naspects of the bill). A bipartisan group of Senators, led by\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

Id.,\nat 15\u201316 (Additional Views of Senators Hatch, Weicker,\nStafford, Dole, Pell, Matsunaga, Simon, Kerry, Kennedy,\nMetzenbaum, Dodd, and Grassley); 131 Cong. Rec. 21389.\n  Senator Weicker explained that the bill:\n    \u201cwill enable courts to compensate parents for what\n    ever reasonable costs they had to incur to fully secure\n    what was guaranteed to them by the EHA. As in other\n    fee shifting statutes, it is our intent that such awards\n    will include, at the discretion of the court, reasonable\n    attorney\u2019s fees, necessary expert witness fees, and other\n    reasonable expenses which were necessary for parents\n    to vindicate their claim to a free appropriate public\n    education for their handicapped child.\u201d Id., at 21390\n    (emphasis added).\nNot a word of opposition to this statement (or the provi\nsion) was voiced on the Senate floor, and S. 415 passed\nwithout a recorded vote. Id., at 21393.\n  The House version of the bill also reflected an intention\nto authorize recovery of expert costs. Following the House\nhearings, the Committee on Education and Labor pro\nduced a substitute bill that authorized courts to \u201caward\nreasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, expenses and costs\u201d to prevail\ning parents. H. R. Rep. No. 99\u2013296, pp. 1, 5 (1985) (em\nphasis added). The House Report stated that\n    \u201cThe phrase \u2018expenses and costs\u2019 includes expenses of\n    expert witnesses; the reasonable costs of any study, re\n    port, test, or project which is found to be necessary for\n    the preparation of the parents\u2019 or guardian\u2019s due proc\n    ess hearing, state administrative review or civil action;\n    as well as traditional costs and expenses incurred in\n    the course of litigating a case (e.g., depositions and in\n    terrogatories).\u201d Id., at 6 (emphasis added).\n4     ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST.

R. 1523\nreached the floor, another substitute bill was introduced.\n131 Cong. Rec. 31369 (1985). This new bill did not change\nin any respect the text of the authorization of expenses\nand costs. It did add a provision, however, that directed\nthe General Accounting Office (GAO)\u2014now known as the\nGovernment Accountability Office, see 31 U. S. C. A. \u00a7731\nnote (Supp. 2006)\u2014to study and report to Congress on the\nfiscal impact of the cost-shifting provision. See id., at\n31369\u201331370. The newly substituted bill passed the\nHouse without a recorded vote. Id., at 31377.\n   Members of the House and Senate (including all of the\nprimary sponsors of the HCPA) then met in conference to\nwork out certain differences. At the conclusion of those\nnegotiations, they produced a Conference Report, which\ncontained the text of the agreed-upon bill and a \u201cJoint\nExplanatory Statement of the Committee of the Confer\nence.\u201d See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 99\u2013687 (1986), Appendix\nA, infra. The Conference accepted the House bill\u2019s GAO\nprovision with \u201can amendment expanding the data collec\ntion requirements of the GAO study to include information\nregarding the amount of funds expended by local educa\ntional agencies and state educational agencies on civil\nactions and administrative proceedings.\u201d Id., at 7. And it\naccepted (with minor changes) the cost-shifting provisions\nprovided in both the Senate and House versions. The\nconferees explained:\n    \u201cWith slightly different wording, both the Senate bill\n    and the House amendment provide for the awarding\n    of attorneys\u2019 fees in addition to costs. The Senate re\n    cedes to the House and the House recedes to the Sen\n    ate with an amendment clarifying that \u2018the court, in\n    its discretion, may award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\n    as part of the costs . . .\u2019 This change in wording incor\n    porates the Supreme Court[\u2019s] Marek v.

A motion was put to each to adopt the Confer\nence Report, and both the Senate and the House agreed to\nthe Conference Report by voice votes. See Appendix B,\ninfra, at 22 (Senate); Appendix C, infra, at 23 (House). No\nobjection was raised to the Conference Report\u2019s statement\nthat the cost-shifting provision was intended to authorize\nexpert costs. I concede that \u201csponsors of the legislation did\nnot mention anything on the floor about expert or consult\nant fees\u201d at the time the Conference Report was submit\nted. Ante, at 3, n. 2 (GINSBURG, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment). But I do not believe that silence\nis significant in light of the fact that every Senator and\nthree of the five Representatives who spoke on the floor\nhad previously signed his name to the Conference Re\nport\u2014a Report that made Congress\u2019 intent clear on the\nfirst page of its explanation. See Appendix A, infra, at 19.\nAnd every Senator and Representative that took the floor\npreceding the votes voiced his strong support for the Con\nference Report. 132 Cong. Rec. 16823\u201316825 (1986) (Sen\nate); id., at 17607\u201317612 (House). The upshot is that\nMembers of both Houses of Congress voted to adopt both\nthe statutory text before us and the Conference Report\nthat made clear that the statute\u2019s words include the expert\ncosts here in question.\n                          B\n  The Act\u2019s basic purpose further supports interpreting\n6     ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST.

See Brief for Respondents\n28, n. 17 (collecting District Court decisions awarding\nexpert costs ranging from $200 to $7,600, and noting three\nreported cases in which expert awards exceeded $10,000).\nThe costs of experts may not make much of a dent in a\nschool district\u2019s budget, as many of the experts they use in\nIDEA proceedings are already on the staff. Cf. Oberti v.\nBoard of Ed. Clementon School Dist., 995 F. 2d 1204, 1219\n(CA3 1993). But to parents, the award of costs may mat\nter enormously.

For one thing, we have repeatedly\nexamined the nature and extent of the financial burdens\nthat the IDEA imposes without reference to the Spending\nClause or any \u201cclear-statement rule.\u201d See, e.g., Burling\nton, supra, at 369 (private school fees); Carter, supra, at 13\n(same); Smith, 468 U. S., at 1010\u20131011 (attorneys\u2019 fees);\nCedar Rapids Community School Dist. v. Garret F., 526\nU. S. 66, 76\u201379 (1999) (continuous nursing service); but\nsee id., at 83 (THOMAS, J., joined by KENNEDY, J., dissent\ning). Those cases did not ask whether the statute \u201cfur\nnishes clear notice\u201d to the affirmative obligation or liabil\nity at issue.\n10    ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                       MURPHY                                \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\n   For another thing, neither Pennhurst nor any other case\nsuggests that every spending detail of a Spending Clause\nstatute must be spelled out with unusual clarity. To the\ncontrary, we have held that Pennhurst\u2019s requirement that\nCongress \u201cunambiguously\u201d set out \u201ca condition on the\ngrant of federal money\u201d does not necessarily apply to\nlegislation setting forth \u201cthe remedies available against a\nnoncomplying State.\u201d Bell v. New Jersey, 461 U. S. 773,\n790, n. 17 (1983) (emphasis added) (rejecting Pennhurst\nbased argument that Elementary and Secondary Educa\ntion Act of 1965 did not unambiguously provide that the\nSecretary could recover federal funds that are misused by\na State). We have added that Pennhurst does not require\nCongress \u201cspecifically\u201d to \u201cidentify\u201d and \u201cproscribe each\ncondition in [Spending Clause] legislation.\u201d Jackson v.\nBirmingham Bd. of Ed., 544 U. S. 167, 183 (2005) (reject\ning argument that Pennhurst precluded interpreting Title\nIX\u2019s private cause of action to encompass retaliation (in\nternal quotation marks and alterations omitted)); see also\nBennett v. Kentucky Dept. of Ed., 470 U. S. 656, 665\u2013666\n(1985). And we have denied any implication that \u201csuits\nunder Spending Clause legislation are suits in contract, or\nthat contract-law principles apply to all issues that they\nraise.\u201d Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U. S. 181, 188\u2013189, n. 2\n(2002) (emphasis added).\n   These statements and holdings are not surprising. After\nall, the basic objective of Pennhurst\u2019s clear-statement\nrequirement does not demand textual clarity in respect to\nevery detail. That is because ambiguity about the precise\nnature of a statutory program\u2019s details\u2014particularly\nwhere they are of a kind that States might have antici\npated\u2014is rarely relevant to the basic question: Would the\nStates have accepted the Federal Government\u2019s funds had\nthey only known the nature of the accompanying condi\ntions? Often, the later filling-in of details through judicial\ninterpretation will not lead one to wonder whether fund\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          11\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ning recipients would have agreed to enter the basic pro\ngram at all. Given the nature of such details, it is clear\nthat the States would have entered the program regard\nless. At the same time, to view each statutory detail of a\nhighly complex federal/state program (involving say,\ntransportation, schools, the environment) simply through\nthe lens of linguistic clarity, rather than to assess its\nmeanings in terms of basic legislative purpose, is to risk a\nset of judicial interpretations that can prevent the pro\ngram, overall, from achieving its basic objectives or that\nmight well reduce a program in its details to incoherence.\n   This case is about just such a detail. Permitting parents\nto recover expert fees will not lead to awards of \u201cindeter\nminate magnitude, untethered to compensable harm\u201d and\nconsequently will not \u201cpose a concern that recipients of\nfederal funding could not reasonably have anticipated.\u201d\nBarnes, 536 U. S., at 191 (SOUTER, J., joined by O\u2019Connor,\nJ., concurring) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted). Unlike, say, punitive damages, an award of\ncosts to expert parties is neither \u201cunorthodox\u201d nor \u201cinde\nterminate,\u201d and thus does not throw into doubt whether\nthe States would have entered into the program. Id., at\n188. If determinations as to whether the IDEA requires\nStates to provide continuing nursing services, Cedar Rap\nids, supra, or reimbursement for private school tuition,\nBurlington, supra, do not call for linguistic clarity, then\nthe precise content of recoverable \u201ccosts\u201d does not call for\nsuch clarity here a fortiori.\n                           B\n  If the Court believes that the statute\u2019s language is\nunambiguous, I must disagree. The provision at issue\nsays that a court \u201cmay award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as\npart of the costs\u201d to parents who prevail in an action\nbrought under the Act. 20 U. S. C. A. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) (Supp.\n2006). The statute neither defines the word \u201ccosts\u201d nor\n12    ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                       MURPHY                                \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\npoints to any other source of law for a definition. And the\nword \u201ccosts,\u201d alone, says nothing at all about which costs\nfalls within its scope.\n   Neither does the statutory phrase\u2014\u201cas part of the costs\nto the parents of a child with a disability who is the pre\nvailing party\u201d\u2014taken in its entirety unambiguously fore\nclose an award of expert fees. I agree that, read literally,\nthat provision does not clearly grant authority to award\nany costs at all. And one might read it, as the Court does,\nas referencing another federal statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71920,\nwhich provides that authority. See ante, at 5; see also\n\u00a71920 (federal taxation of cost statute). But such a read\ning is not inevitable. The provision (indeed, the entire\nAct) says nothing about that other statute. And one can,\nconsistent with the language, read the provision as both\nembodying a general authority to award costs while also\nspecifying the inclusion of \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d as\npart of those costs (as saying, for example, that a court\n\u201cmay award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of [a] costs\n[award]\u201d).\n   This latter reading, while linguistically the less natural,\nis legislatively the more likely. The majority\u2019s alternative\nreading, by cross-referencing only the federal general cost-\nawarding statute (which applies solely in federal courts),\nwould produce a jumble of different cost definitions appli\ncable to similar IDEA administrative and state-court\nproceedings in different States. See \u00a71920 (\u201cA judge or\nclerk of any court of the United States may tax as costs the\nfollowing. . . .\u201d (emphasis added)). This result is particu\nlarly odd, as all IDEA actions must begin in state due\nprocess hearings, where the federal cost statute clearly\ndoes not apply, and the overwhelming majority of these\nactions are never appealed to any court.

At most, the majority\u2019s\nreading of the text is plausible; it is not the only possible\nreading.\n                                C\n   The majority\u2019s most persuasive argument does not focus\non either the Spending Clause or lack of statutory ambigu\nity. Rather, the majority says that \u201ccosts\u201d is a term of art.\nIn light of the law\u2019s long practice of excluding expert fees\nfrom the scope of the word \u201ccosts,\u201d along with this Court\u2019s\ncases interpreting the word similarly in other statutes, the\n\u201clegislative history is simply not enough.\u201d Ante, at 12.\n   I am perfectly willing to assume that the majority is\ncorrect about the traditional scope of the word \u201ccosts.\u201d In\ntwo cases this Court has held that the word \u201ccosts\u201d is\nlimited to the list set forth in 28 U. S. C. \u00a71920 and does\nnot include fees paid to experts. See Crawford Fitting Co.\nv. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437 (1987) (interpreting Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 54(d)); West Virginia Univ.

Id., at 91\u201392, n. 5 (charac\nterizing language as an \u201capparent effort to depart from\nordinary meaning and to define a term of art\u201d and noting\nthat Congress made no such \u201ceffort\u201d in respect to 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71988).\n   Regardless, here the statute itself indicates that Con\ngress did not intend to use the word \u201ccosts\u201d as a term of\nart. The HCPA, which added the cost-shifting provision\n(in \u00a72) to the IDEA, also added another provision (in \u00a74)\ndirecting the GAO to \u201cconduct a study of the impact of the\namendments to the [IDEA] made by section 2\u201d over a 31\u20442\nyear period following the Act\u2019s effective date. \u00a74(a), 100\nStat. 797.

Nor does the federal costs statute cover any\nexpenses\u2014at least not any that Congress could have\nwanted the GAO to study. Cf. 28 U. S. C. \u00a71920 (referring\nonly once to \u201cexpenses,\u201d and doing so solely to refer to\nspecial interpretation services provided in actions initiated\nby the United States).\n  Further, why did Congress, when asking the GAO (in\nthe statute itself) to study the \u201cnumbers of hours spent by\npersonnel\u201d include among those personnel both attorneys\n\u201cand consultants\u201d? Who but experts could those consult\nants be? Why would Congress want the GAO to study the\nhours that those experts \u201cspent,\u201d unless it thought that it\nwould help keep track of the \u201ccosts\u201d that the statute\nimposed?\n  Of course, one might, through speculation, find other\nanswers to these questions. One might, for example,\nimagine that Congress wanted the GAO to study the\nexpenses that payment of expert fees engendered in state-\ncourt proceedings where state, but not federal, law re\nquires that \u201c \u2018expenses\u2019 other than \u2018costs\u2019 might be receiv\nable.\u201d Ante, at 7, n. 1; but see supra, at 12-13. Or one\nmight think that the word \u201cexpenses\u201d is surplusage. Ante,\nat 7, n. 1; but see Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174\n(2001) (expressing Court\u2019s \u201c \u2018reluctan[ce] to treat statutory\nterms as surplusage in any setting,\u2019\u201d but especially when\nthey play \u201ca pivotal role in the statutory scheme\u201d). Or one\nmight believe that Congress was interested in the hours\nthese experts spent, but not in the fees they obtained.\nAnte, at 7. But these answers are not necessarily consis\ntent with the purpose of the GAO study provision, a pur\npose revealed by the language of the provision and its\nposition in the statute. Its placement and its reference to\n\u00a72 indicate that Congress ordered the study to help it keep\ntrack of the magnitude of the reimbursements that an\n16    ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD.

And the only\nreimbursement requirement that \u00a72 mandates is the\npayment of \u201ccosts.\u201d\n   But why speculate about this? We know what Congress\nintended the GAO study to cover. It told the GAO in its\nConference Report that the word \u201ccosts\u201d included the costs\nof experts. And, not surprisingly, the GAO made clear\nthat it understood precisely what Congress asked it to do.\nIn its final report, the GAO wrote: \u201cParents can receive\nreimbursement from state or local education agencies for\nsome or all of their attorney fees and related expenses if\nthey are the prevailing party in part or all of administra\ntive hearings or court proceedings. Expert witness fees,\ncosts of tests or evaluations found to be necessary during\nthe case, and court costs for services rendered during ad\nministrative and court proceedings are examples of reim\nbursable expenses.\u201d GAO, Briefing Report to Congres\nsional Requesters, Special Education: The Attorney Fees\nProvision of Public Law 99\u2013372 GAO/HRD\u201322BR, p. 13\n(Nov. 1989). At the very least, this amounts to some indi\ncation that Congress intended the word \u201ccosts,\u201d not as a\nterm of art, not as it was used in the statutes at issue in\nCasey and Crawford Fitting, but rather as including cer\ntain additional \u201cexpenses.\u201d If that is so, the claims of\ntradition, of the interpretation this Court has given other\nstatutes, cannot be so strong as to prevent us from exam\nining the legislative history. And that history could not be\nmore clear about the matter: Congress intended the\nstatutory phrase \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u201d to\ninclude the costs of experts.

And our ultimate\njudicial goal is to interpret language in light of the statute\u2019s\npurpose. Only by seeking that purpose can we avoid the\nsubstitution of judicial for legislative will. Only by reading\nlanguage in its light can we maintain the democratic link\nbetween voters, legislators, statutes, and ultimate imple\nmentation, upon which the legitimacy of our constitutional\nsystem rests.\n   In my view, to keep faith with that interpretive goal, we\nmust retain all traditional interpretive tools\u2014text, struc\nture, history, and purpose. And, because faithful interpre\ntation is art as well as science, we cannot, through rule or\ncanon, rule out the use of any of these tools, automatically\nand in advance. Cf. Helvering v. Gregory, 69 F. 2d 809,\n810\u2013811 (CA2 1934) (L. Hand, J.).\n   Nothing in the Constitution forbids us from giving\nsignificant weight to legislative history. By disregarding a\nclear statement in a legislative report adopted without\nopposition in both Houses of Congress, the majority has\nreached a result no Member of Congress expected or\novertly desired.

MURPHY ET VIR. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 05\u201318. Argued April 19, 2006\u2014Decided June 26, 2006\nAfter respondents prevailed in their Individuals with Disabilities Edu\n  cation Act (IDEA) action to require petitioner school board to pay for\n  their son\u2019s private school tuition, they sought fees for services ren\n  dered by an educational consultant during the proceedings, relying\n  on an IDEA provision that permits a court to \u201caward reasonable at\n  torneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u201d to prevailing parents, 20 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71415(i)(3)(B). The District Court granted their motion in part. Af\n  firming, the Second Circuit noted that, under Crawford Fitting Co. v.\n  J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437, and West Virginia Univ. Hospitals,\n  Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83, a cost- or fee-shifting provision will not be\n  read to permit recovery of expert fees without explicit statutory au\n  thority, but concluded that a congressional Conference Committee\n  Report relating to \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) and a footnote in Casey referencing\n  that Report showed that the IDEA authorized such reimbursement.\nHeld: Section \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) does not authorize prevailing parents to\n recover expert fees. Pp. 3\u201312.\n    (a) The resolution of this question is guided by the fact that Con\n gress enacted the IDEA pursuant to the Spending Clause. While\n Congress has broad power to set the terms on which it disburses fed\n eral money to the States, any conditions it attaches to a State\u2019s ac\n ceptance of such funds must be set out \u201cunambiguously.\u201d Pennhurst\n State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17. Fund re\n cipients are bound only by those conditions that they accept \u201cvolun\n tarily and knowingly,\u201d ibid., and States cannot knowingly accept con\n ditions of which they are \u201cunaware\u201d or which they are \u201cunable to\n ascertain,\u201d ibid. Thus, the question here is whether the IDEA fur\n nishes clear notice regarding expert fees. Pp. 3\u20134.\n2         ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                          MURPHY                                                  \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n       (b) The Court begins with the IDEA\u2019s text, for if its \u201clanguage is\n    plain,\u201d the courts\u2019 function \u201c \u2018 \u201cis to enforce it according to its terms.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n    Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union Planters Bank, N. A., 530\n    U. S. 1, 6. While \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) provides for an award of \u201creasonable\n    attorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d it does not even hint that acceptance of IDEA funds\n    makes a State responsible for reimbursing prevailing parents for the\n    services of experts. \u201cCosts\u201d is a term of art that does not generally\n    include expert fees. The use of \u201ccosts\u201d rather than \u201cexpenses\u201d\n    strongly suggests that \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) was not meant to be an open-\n    ended provision making States liable for all expenses. Moreover,\n    \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) says not that a court may award \u201ccosts\u201d but that it may\n    award attorney\u2019s fees \u201cas part of the costs.\u201d This language simply\n    adds reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the list of recoverable costs set out\n    in 28 U. S. C. \u00a71920, the general statute covering taxation of costs,\n    which is strictly limited by \u00a71821. Thus, \u00a71415(i)(3)(B)\u2019s text does not\n    authorize an award of additional expert fees, and it certainly fails to\n    present the clear notice required by the Spending Clause. Other\n    IDEA provisions point strongly in the same direction. Of little sig\n    nificance here is a provision in the Handicapped Children\u2019s Protec\n    tion Act of 1986 requiring the General Accounting Office to collect\n    data on awards to prevailing parties in IDEA cases, but making no\n    mention of consultants or experts or their fees. And the fact that the\n    provision directed the GAO to compile data on the hours spent by\n    consultants in IDEA cases does not mean that Congress intended for\n    States to compensate prevailing parties for fees billed by these con\n    sultants. Pp. 4\u20138.\n       (c) Crawford Fitting Co. and Casey strongly reinforce the conclu\n    sion that the IDEA does not unambiguously authorize prevailing\n    parents to recover expert fees. Crawford Fitting Co.\u2019s reasoning sup\n    ports the conclusion that the term \u201ccosts\u201d in \u00a71415(i)(3)(B), like\n    \u201ccosts\u201d in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d), the provision at issue\n    there, is defined by the categories of expenses enumerated in 28\n    U. S. C. \u00a71920. This conclusion is buttressed by the principle, recog\n    nized in Crawford Fitting Co., that no statute will be construed to au\n    thorize taxing witness fees as costs unless the statute \u201crefer[s] explic\n    itly to witness fees.\u201d 482 U. S., at 445. The conclusion that the IDEA\n    does not authorize expert fee awards is confirmed even more dra\n    matically by Casey, where the Court held that 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988, a\n    fee-shifting provision with wording virtually identical to that of 20\n    U. S. C. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B), did not empower a district court to award ex\n    pert fees to a prevailing party. 482 U. S., at 102. The Second Circuit\n    misunderstood the meaning of the Casey footnote on which it relied.\n    That footnote did not state that the Conference Committee Report set\n    out the correct interpretation of \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) or provided the clear\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

Its thrust was simply\n  that \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d standing alone, is generally not understood as\n  encompassing expert fees. Pp. 8\u201311.\n    (d) Respondents\u2019 additional arguments are unpersuasive. The\n  IDEA\u2019s goals of \u201censur[ing] that all children with disabilities have\n  available to them a free appropriate public education,\u201d\n  \u00a71400(d)(1)(A), and of safeguarding parents\u2019 right to challenge ad\n  verse school decisions are too general to provide much support for\n  their reading of the IDEA. And the IDEA\u2019s legislative history is in\n  sufficient help, where everything other than that history overwhelm\n  ingly suggests that expert fees may not be recovered.

This reduced the maximum recov\nery to $8,650. The District Court also held that Arons, a\nnonlawyer, could be compensated only for time spent on\nexpert consulting services, not for time spent on legal\nrepresentation, id., at *4, but it concluded that all the\nrelevant time could be characterized as falling within the\ncompensable category, and thus allowed compensation for\nthe full $8,650, id., at *10.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.\n402 F. 3d 332 (2005). Acknowledging that other Circuits\nhad taken the opposite view, the Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit held that \u201cCongress intended to and did\nauthorize the reimbursement of expert fees in IDEA ac\ntions.\u201d Id., at 336. The court began by discussing two\ndecisions of this Court holding that expert fees could not\nbe recovered as taxed costs under particular cost- or fee-\nshifting provisions. See Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gib\nbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437 (1987) (interpreting Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 54(d) and 28 U. S. C. \u00a71920); West Virginia Univ.\nHospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83 (1991) (interpreting 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71988 (1988 ed.)). According to these decisions, the\ncourt noted, a cost- or fee-shifting provision will not be read\nto permit a prevailing party to recover expert fees without\n\u201c\u2018explicit statutory authority\u2019 indicating that Congress\nintended for that sort of fee-shifting.\u201d 402 F. 3d, at 336.\n   Ultimately, though, the court was persuaded by a state\nment in the Conference Committee Report relating to 20\nU.

We now reverse.\n                              II\n  Our resolution of the question presented in this case is\nguided by the fact that Congress enacted the IDEA pursu\nant to the Spending Clause. U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 1;\nsee Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. ____ (2005). Like its\nstatutory predecessor, the IDEA provides federal funds to\nassist state and local agencies in educating children with\ndisabilities \u201cand conditions such funding upon a State\u2019s\ncompliance with extensive goals and procedures.\u201d Board of\nEd. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester\nCty. v. Rowley, 458 U. S. 176, 179 (1982).\n  Congress has broad power to set the terms on which it\ndisburses federal money to the States, see, e.g., South\nDakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 206\u2013207 (1987), but when\nCongress attaches conditions to a State\u2019s acceptance of\nfederal funds, the conditions must be set out \u201cunambigu\nously,\u201d see Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halder\nman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981); Rowley, supra, at 204, n. 26.\n\u201c[L]egislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is\nmuch in the nature of a contract,\u201d and therefore, to be bound\nby \u201cfederally imposed conditions,\u201d recipients of federal funds\n4     ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                      MURPHY                                \n\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\nmust accept them \u201cvoluntarily and knowingly.\u201d Pennhurst,\n451 U. S., at 17. States cannot knowingly accept conditions\nof which they are \u201cunaware\u201d or which they are \u201cunable to\nascertain.\u201d Ibid. Thus, in the present case, we must view\nthe IDEA from the perspective of a state official who is\nengaged in the process of deciding whether the State should\naccept IDEA funds and the obligations that go with those\nfunds. We must ask whether such a state official would\nclearly understand that one of the obligations of the Act is\nthe obligation to compensate prevailing parents for expert\nfees. In other words, we must ask whether the IDEA\nfurnishes clear notice regarding the liability at issue in\nthis case.\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n  In considering whether the IDEA provides clear notice,\nwe begin with the text. We have \u201cstated time and again\nthat courts must presume that a legislature says in a\nstatute what it means and means in a statute what it says\nthere.\u201d Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249,\n253\u2013254 (1992). When the statutory \u201clanguage is plain, the\nsole function of the courts\u2014at least where the disposition\nrequired by the text is not absurd\u2014is to enforce it according\nto its terms.\u201d Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union\nPlanters Bank, N. A., 530 U. S. 1, 6 (2000) (quoting United\nStates v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235, 241\n(1989), in turn quoting Caminetti v. United States, 242 U. S.\n470, 485 (1917); internal quotation marks omitted).\n  The governing provision of the IDEA, 20 U. S. C.\n\u00a71415(i)(3)(B), provides that \u201c[i]n any action or proceeding\nbrought under this section, the court, in its discretion,\nmay award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u201d\nto the parents of \u201ca child with a disability\u201d who is the\n\u201cprevailing party.\u201d While this provision provides for an\naward of \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d this provision does\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot even hint that acceptance of IDEA funds makes a\nState responsible for reimbursing prevailing parents for\nservices rendered by experts.\n   Respondents contend that we should interpret the term\n\u201ccosts\u201d in accordance with its meaning in ordinary usage\nand that \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) should therefore be read to \u201cau\nthorize reimbursement of all costs parents incur in IDEA\nproceedings, including expert costs.\u201d Brief for Respon\ndents 17.\n   This argument has multiple flaws. For one thing, as the\nCourt of Appeals in this case acknowledged, \u201c \u2018costs\u2019 is a\nterm of art that generally does not include expert fees.\u201d\n402 F. 3d, at 336. The use of this term of art, rather than\na term such as \u201cexpenses,\u201d strongly suggests that\n\u00a71415(i)(3)(B) was not meant to be an open-ended provi\nsion that makes participating States liable for all expenses\nincurred by prevailing parents in connection with an\nIDEA case\u2014for example, travel and lodging expenses or\nlost wages due to time taken off from work. Moreover,\ncontrary to respondents\u2019 suggestion, \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) does\nnot say that a court may award \u201ccosts\u201d to prevailing par\nents; rather, it says that a court may award reasonable\nattorney\u2019s fees \u201cas part of the costs\u201d to prevailing parents.\nThis language simply adds reasonable attorney\u2019s fees\nincurred by prevailing parents to the list of costs that\nprevailing parents are otherwise entitled to recover. This\nlist of otherwise recoverable costs is obviously the list set\nout in 28 U. S. C. \u00a71920, the general statute governing the\ntaxation of costs in federal court, and the recovery of\nwitness fees under \u00a71920 is strictly limited by \u00a71821,\nwhich authorizes travel reimbursement and a $40 per\ndiem. Thus, the text of 20 U. S. C. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) does not\nauthorize an award of any additional expert fees, and it\ncertainly fails to provide the clear notice that is required\nunder the Spending Clause.\n   Other provisions of the IDEA point strongly in the same\n6     ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                      MURPHY                                \n\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\ndirection. While authorizing the award of reasonable\nattorney\u2019s fees, the Act contains detailed provisions that\nare designed to ensure that such awards are indeed rea\nsonable. See \u00a7\u00a71415(i)(3)(C)\u2013(G). The absence of any\ncomparable provisions relating to expert fees strongly\nsuggests that recovery of expert fees is not authorized.\nMoreover, the lack of any reference to expert fees in\n\u00a71415(d)(2) gives rise to a similar inference. This provi\nsion, which generally requires that parents receive \u201ca full\nexplanation of the procedural safeguards\u201d available under\n\u00a71415 and refers expressly to \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d makes no\nmention of expert fees.\n                               B\n   Respondents contend that their interpretation of\n\u00a71415(i)(3)(B) is supported by a provision of the Handi\ncapped Children\u2019s Protection Act of 1986 that required the\nGeneral Accounting Office (GAO) to collect certain data,\n\u00a74(b)(3), 100 Stat. 797 (hereinafter GAO study provision),\nbut this provision is of little significance for present pur\nposes. The GAO study provision directed the Comptroller\nGeneral, acting through the GAO, to compile data on,\namong other things: \u201c(A) the specific amount of attorneys\u2019\nfees, costs, and expenses awarded to the prevailing party\u201d in\nIDEA cases for a particular period of time, and (B) \u201cthe\nnumber of hours spent by personnel, including attorneys\nand consultants, involved in the action or proceeding, and\nexpenses incurred by the parents and the State educa\ntional agency and local educational agency.\u201d Id., at 797\u2013\n798.\n   Subparagraph (A) would provide some support for re\nspondents\u2019 position if it directed the GAO to compile data\non awards to prevailing parties of the expense of hiring\nconsultants, but that is not what subparagraph (A) says.\nSubparagraph (A) makes no mention of consultants or\n                      Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                       7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nexperts or their fees.1\n  Subparagraph (B) similarly does not help respondents.\nSubparagraph (B), which directs the GAO to study \u201cthe\nnumber of hours spent [in IDEA cases] by personnel,\nincluding . . . consultants,\u201d says nothing about the award\nof fees to such consultants. Just because Congress di\nrected the GAO to compile statistics on the hours spent by\nconsultants in IDEA cases, it does not follow that Con\ngress meant for States to compensate prevailing parties\nfor the fees billed by these consultants.\n  Respondents maintain that \u201cCongress\u2019 direction to the\nGAO would be inexplicable if Congress did not anticipate\nthat the expenses for \u2018consultants\u2019 would be recoverable,\u201d\nBrief for Respondents 19, but this is incorrect. There are\nmany reasons why Congress might have wanted the GAO\nto gather data on expenses that were not to be taxed as\ncosts. Knowing the costs incurred by IDEA litigants might\nbe useful in considering future procedural amendments\n(which might affect these costs) or a future amendment\nregarding fee shifting. And, in fact, it is apparent that the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Because   subparagraph (A) refers to both \u201ccosts\u201d and \u201cexpenses\u201d\nawarded to prevailing parties and because it is generally presumed that\nstatutory language is not superfluous, it could be argued that this provi\nsion manifests the expectation that prevailing parties would be awarded\ncertain \u201cexpenses\u201d not included in the list of \u201ccosts\u201d set out in 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71920 and that expert fees were intended to be among these unenumer\nated \u201cexpenses.\u201d This argument fails because, whatever expectation this\nlanguage might seem to evidence, the fact remains that neither 20 U. S. C.\n\u00a71415 nor any other provision of the IDEA authorizes the award of any\n\u201cexpenses\u201d other than \u201ccosts.\u201d Recognizing this, respondents argue not\nthat they are entitled to recover \u201cexpenses\u201d that are not \u201ccosts,\u201d but that\nexpert fees are recoverable \u201ccosts.\u201d As a result, the reference to awards of\nboth \u201cexpenses\u201d and \u201ccosts\u201d does not support respondents\u2019 position. The\nreference to \u201cexpenses\u201d may relate to IDEA actions brought in state court,\n\u00a71415(i)(2)(A), where \u201cexpenses\u201d other than \u201ccosts\u201d might be receivable.\nOr the reference may be surplusage. While it is generally presumed that\nstatutes do not contain surplusage, instances of surplusage are not\nunknown.\n8          ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                           MURPHY                                            \n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n\nGAO study provision covered expenses that could not be\ntaxed as costs. For example, the GAO was instructed to\ncompile statistics on the hours spent by all attorneys\ninvolved in an IDEA action or proceeding, even though the\nAct did not provide for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees by a\nprevailing state or local educational agency.2 Similarly,\nthe GAO was directed to compile data on \u201cexpenses in\ncurred by the parents,\u201d not just those parents who prevail\nand are thus eligible to recover taxed costs.\n  In sum, the terms of the IDEA overwhelmingly support\nthe conclusion that prevailing parents may not recover the\ncosts of experts or consultants. Certainly the terms of the\nIDEA fail to provide the clear notice that would be needed\nto attach such a condition to a State\u2019s receipt of IDEA\nfunds.\n                              IV\n   Thus far, we have considered only the text of the IDEA,\nbut perhaps the strongest support for our interpretation of\nthe IDEA is supplied by our decisions and reasoning in\nCrawford Fitting, 482 U. S. 437, and Casey, 499 U. S. 83.\nIn light of those decisions, we do not see how it can be said\nthat the IDEA gives a State unambiguous notice regarding\nliability for expert fees.\n   In Crawford Fitting, the Court rejected an argument\nvery similar to respondents\u2019 argument that the term\n\u201ccosts\u201d in \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) should be construed as an open-\nended reference to prevailing parents\u2019 expenses. It was\nargued in Crawford Fitting that Federal Rule of Civil\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 In\n      2000, the attorneys\u2019 fees provision provided only an award to\nprevailing parents. See 20 U. S. C. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B). In 2004, Congress\namended \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) to include two additional awards. See \u00a7101,\n118 Stat. 2724. The amendments provided awards \u201cto a prevailing\nparty who is a State educational agency or local educational agency\u201d\nwhere the complaint filed is frivolous or presented for an improper\npurpose, such as to harass, delay, or increase the cost of litigation. See\n20 U. S. C. A. \u00a7\u00a71415(i)(3)(B)(i)(II)\u2013(III) (Supp. 2006).\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

S. C. \u00a71821. 482 U. S., at 439. The Court held,\nhowever, that Rule 54(d) does not give a district judge\n\u201cdiscretion to tax whatever costs may seem appropriate\u201d;\nrather, the term \u201ccosts\u201d in Rule 54(d) is defined by the list\nset out in \u00a71920. Id., at 441. Because the recovery of\nwitness fees, see \u00a71920(3), is strictly limited by \u00a71821, the\nCourt observed, a broader interpretation of Rule 54(d)\nwould mean that the Rule implicitly effected a partial\nrepeal of those provisions. Id., at 442. But, the Court\nwarned, \u201c[w]e will not lightly infer that Congress has\nrepealed \u00a7\u00a71920 and 1821, either through Rule 54(d) or\nany other provision not referring explicitly to witness\nfees.\u201d Id., at 445.\n  The reasoning of Crawford Fitting strongly supports the\nconclusion that the term \u201ccosts\u201d in 20 U. S. C.\n\u00a71415(i)(3)(B), like the same term in Rule 54(d), is defined\nby the categories of expenses enumerated in 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71920. This conclusion is buttressed by the principle,\nrecognized in Crawford Fitting, that no statute will be\nconstrued as authorizing the taxation of witness fees as\ncosts unless the statute \u201crefer[s] explicitly to witness fees.\u201d\n482 U. S., at 445; see also ibid.

S. C. \u00a71821 and\n\u00a71920\u201d).\n  Our decision in Casey confirms even more dramatically\nthat the IDEA does not authorize an award of expert fees.\nIn Casey, as noted above, we interpreted a fee-shifting\nprovision, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988, the relevant wording of which\nwas virtually identical to the wording of 20 U. S. C.\n\u00a71415(i)(3)(B). Compare ibid. (authorizing the award of\n\u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u201d to prevail\ning parents) with 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988(b) (1988 ed.) (permit\n10    ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD.

Casey, supra, at\n102. To decide in favor of respondents here, we would\nhave to interpret the virtually identical language in 20\nU. S. C. \u00a71415 as having exactly the opposite meaning.\nIndeed, we would have to go further and hold that the\nrelevant language in the IDEA unambiguously means\nexactly the opposite of what the nearly identical language\nin 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988 was held to mean in Casey.\n   The Court of Appeals, as noted above, was heavily influ\nenced by a Casey footnote, see 402 F. 3d, at 336\u2013337 (quot\ning 499 U. S., at 91\u201392, n. 5), but the court misunderstood\nthe footnote\u2019s meaning. The text accompanying the foot\nnote argued, based on an analysis of several fee-shifting\nstatutes, that the term \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d does not include\nexpert fees. Id., at 88\u201391. In the footnote, we commented\non petitioners\u2019 invocation of the Conference Committee\nReport relating to 20 U. S. C. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B), which stated:\n\u201c \u2018The conferees intend[ed] that the term \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees as\npart of the costs\u201d include reasonable expenses and fees of\nexpert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or\nevaluation which is found to be necessary for the prepara\ntion of the . . . case.\u2019 \u201d 499 U.

The footnote did not\nstate that the Conference Committee Report set out the\ncorrect interpretation of \u00a71415(i)(3)(B), much less that the\nReport was sufficient, despite the language of the statute,\nto provide the clear notice required under the Spending\nClause. The thrust of the footnote was simply that the\nterm \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d standing alone, is generally not\nunderstood as encompassing expert fees.

Because the IDEA is not intended in all\ninstances to further the broad goals identified by the\nrespondents at the expense of fiscal considerations, the\ngoals cited by respondents do little to bolster their argu\nment on the narrow question presented here.3\n  Finally, respondents vigorously argue that Congress\nclearly intended for prevailing parents to be compensated\nfor expert fees. They rely on the legislative history of\n\u00a71415 and in particular on the following statement in the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Respondents note that a GAO report stated that expert witness fees\n\nare reimbursable expenses.

The Court extracts from Pennhurst State School and\nHospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981), a \u201cclear\nnotice\u201d requirement, and deems it applicable in this case\nbecause Congress enacted the Individuals with Disabili\nties Education Act (IDEA), as it did the legislation at issue\nin Pennhurst, pursuant to the Spending Clause. Ante, at\n3\u20134. That extraction, in my judgment, is unwarranted.\nPennhurst\u2019s \u201cclear notice\u201d requirement should not be\nunmoored from its context. The Court there confronted a\nplea to impose \u201can unexpected condition for compliance\u2014a\nnew [programmatic] obligation for participating States.\u201d\nBell v. New Jersey, 461 U. S. 773, 790, n. 17 (1983). The\ncontroversy here is lower key: It concerns not the educa\ntional programs IDEA directs school districts to provide,\nbut \u201cthe remedies available against a noncomplying [dis\ntrict].\u201d Ibid; see post, at 9\u201311 (BREYER, J., dissenting).\n   The Court\u2019s repeated references to a Spending Clause\nderived \u201cclear notice\u201d requirement, see ante, at 3\u20134, 6, 8,\n11, and n. 3, 12, are questionable on other grounds as well.\nFor one thing, IDEA was enacted not only pursuant to\n2      ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST.

Furthermore, no \u201cclear notice\u201d prop is needed\nin this case given the twin pillars on which the Court\u2019s\njudgment securely rests. First, as the Court explains,\nante, at 4\u20136, the specific, attorneys\u2019-fees-oriented, provi\nsions of IDEA, i.e., 20 U. S. C. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B)\u2013(G);\n\u00a71415(d)(2)(L), \u201coverwhelmingly support the conclusion\nthat prevailing parents may not recover the costs of ex\nperts or consultants,\u201d ante, at 8. Those provisions place\ncontrols on fees recoverable for attorneys\u2019 services, without\nmentioning costs parents might incur for other profes\nsional services and controls geared to those costs. Second,\nas the Court develops, prior decisions closely in point\n\u201cstrongly suppor[t],\u201d even \u201cconfir[m] . . . dramatically,\u201d\ntoday\u2019s holding that IDEA trains on attorneys\u2019 fees and\ndoes not authorize an award covering amounts paid or\npayable for the services of an educational consultant.\nAnte, at 9 (citing Crawford Fitting Co. v.

Unlike the Court, I believe that the word\n\u201ccosts\u201d includes, and authorizes payment of, the costs of\nexperts. The word \u201ccosts\u201d does not define its own scope.\nNeither does the phrase \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees as part of costs.\u201d\nBut Members of Congress did make clear their intent by,\namong other things, approving a Conference Report that\nspecified that \u201cthe term \u2018attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u2019\ninclude[s] reasonable expenses of expert witnesses and\nreasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to\nbe necessary for the preparation of the parent or guard\nian\u2019s case in the action or proceeding.\u201d H.

No\nSenator or Representative voiced any opposition to this\nstatement in the discussion preceding the vote on the\nConference Report\u2014the last vote on the bill before it was\nsent to the President. I can find no good reason for this\nCourt to interpret the language of this statute as meaning\nthe precise opposite of what Congress told us it intended.\n2     ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                       MURPHY                                \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\n                              I\n   There are two strong reasons for interpreting the statu\ntory phrase to include the award of expert fees. First, that\nis what Congress said it intended by the phrase. Second,\nthat interpretation furthers the IDEA\u2019s statutorily defined\npurposes.\n                              A\n   Congress added the IDEA\u2019s cost-shifting provision when\nit enacted the Handicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act of\n1986 (HCPA), 100 Stat. 796. Senator Lowell Weicker\nintroduced the relevant bill in 1985. 131 Cong. Rec. 1979\u2013\n1980 (1985). As introduced, it sought to overturn this\nCourt\u2019s determination that the then-current version of the\nIDEA (and other civil rights statutes) did not authorize\ncourts to award attorneys\u2019 fees to prevailing parents in\nIDEA cases. See Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992 (1984).\nThe bill provided that \u201c[i]n any action or proceeding\nbrought under this subsection, the court, in its discretion,\nmay award a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs\nto a parent or legal representative of a handicapped child\nor youth who is the prevailing party.\u201d 131 Cong. Rec.\n1980; see S. Rep. No. 99\u2013112, p. 2 (1985).\n   After hearings and debate, several Senators introduced\na new bill in the Senate that would have put a cap on\nattorneys\u2019 fees for legal services lawyers, but at the same\ntime would have explicitly authorized the award of \u201ca\nreasonable attorney\u2019s fee, reasonable witness fees, and\nother reasonable expenses of the civil action, in addition to\nthe costs to a parent . . . who is the prevailing party.\u201d Id.,\nat 7 (emphasis added). While no Senator objected to the\nlatter provision, some objected to the cap. See, e.g., id., at\n17\u201318 (Additional Views of Senators Kerry, Kennedy, Pell,\nDodd, Simon, Metzenbaum and Matsunaga) (accepting\ncost-shifting provision, but objecting to cap and other\naspects of the bill). A bipartisan group of Senators, led by\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

Id.,\nat 15\u201316 (Additional Views of Senators Hatch, Weicker,\nStafford, Dole, Pell, Matsunaga, Simon, Kerry, Kennedy,\nMetzenbaum, Dodd, and Grassley); 131 Cong. Rec. 21389.\n  Senator Weicker explained that the bill:\n    \u201cwill enable courts to compensate parents for what\n    ever reasonable costs they had to incur to fully secure\n    what was guaranteed to them by the EHA. As in other\n    fee shifting statutes, it is our intent that such awards\n    will include, at the discretion of the court, reasonable\n    attorney\u2019s fees, necessary expert witness fees, and other\n    reasonable expenses which were necessary for parents\n    to vindicate their claim to a free appropriate public\n    education for their handicapped child.\u201d Id., at 21390\n    (emphasis added).\nNot a word of opposition to this statement (or the provi\nsion) was voiced on the Senate floor, and S. 415 passed\nwithout a recorded vote. Id., at 21393.\n  The House version of the bill also reflected an intention\nto authorize recovery of expert costs. Following the House\nhearings, the Committee on Education and Labor pro\nduced a substitute bill that authorized courts to \u201caward\nreasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, expenses and costs\u201d to prevail\ning parents. H. R. Rep. No. 99\u2013296, pp. 1, 5 (1985) (em\nphasis added). The House Report stated that\n    \u201cThe phrase \u2018expenses and costs\u2019 includes expenses of\n    expert witnesses; the reasonable costs of any study, re\n    port, test, or project which is found to be necessary for\n    the preparation of the parents\u2019 or guardian\u2019s due proc\n    ess hearing, state administrative review or civil action;\n    as well as traditional costs and expenses incurred in\n    the course of litigating a case (e.g., depositions and in\n    terrogatories).\u201d Id., at 6 (emphasis added).\n4     ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST.

R. 1523\nreached the floor, another substitute bill was introduced.\n131 Cong. Rec. 31369 (1985). This new bill did not change\nin any respect the text of the authorization of expenses\nand costs. It did add a provision, however, that directed\nthe General Accounting Office (GAO)\u2014now known as the\nGovernment Accountability Office, see 31 U. S. C. A. \u00a7731\nnote (Supp. 2006)\u2014to study and report to Congress on the\nfiscal impact of the cost-shifting provision. See id., at\n31369\u201331370. The newly substituted bill passed the\nHouse without a recorded vote. Id., at 31377.\n   Members of the House and Senate (including all of the\nprimary sponsors of the HCPA) then met in conference to\nwork out certain differences. At the conclusion of those\nnegotiations, they produced a Conference Report, which\ncontained the text of the agreed-upon bill and a \u201cJoint\nExplanatory Statement of the Committee of the Confer\nence.\u201d See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 99\u2013687 (1986), Appendix\nA, infra. The Conference accepted the House bill\u2019s GAO\nprovision with \u201can amendment expanding the data collec\ntion requirements of the GAO study to include information\nregarding the amount of funds expended by local educa\ntional agencies and state educational agencies on civil\nactions and administrative proceedings.\u201d Id., at 7. And it\naccepted (with minor changes) the cost-shifting provisions\nprovided in both the Senate and House versions. The\nconferees explained:\n    \u201cWith slightly different wording, both the Senate bill\n    and the House amendment provide for the awarding\n    of attorneys\u2019 fees in addition to costs. The Senate re\n    cedes to the House and the House recedes to the Sen\n    ate with an amendment clarifying that \u2018the court, in\n    its discretion, may award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\n    as part of the costs . . .\u2019 This change in wording incor\n    porates the Supreme Court[\u2019s] Marek v.

The conferees intend that the\n     term \u2018attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u2019 include rea\n     sonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the\n     reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is\n     found to be necessary for the preparation of the parent\n     or guardian\u2019s case in the action or proceeding, as well\n     as traditional costs incurred in the course of litigating\n     a case.\u201d Id., at 5 (emphasis added; citation omitted).\n   The Conference Report was returned to the Senate and\nthe House. A motion was put to each to adopt the Confer\nence Report, and both the Senate and the House agreed to\nthe Conference Report by voice votes. See Appendix B,\ninfra, at 22 (Senate); Appendix C, infra, at 23 (House). No\nobjection was raised to the Conference Report\u2019s statement\nthat the cost-shifting provision was intended to authorize\nexpert costs. I concede that \u201csponsors of the legislation did\nnot mention anything on the floor about expert or consult\nant fees\u201d at the time the Conference Report was submit\nted. Ante, at 3, n. 2 (GINSBURG, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment). But I do not believe that silence\nis significant in light of the fact that every Senator and\nthree of the five Representatives who spoke on the floor\nhad previously signed his name to the Conference Re\nport\u2014a Report that made Congress\u2019 intent clear on the\nfirst page of its explanation. See Appendix A, infra, at 19.\nAnd every Senator and Representative that took the floor\npreceding the votes voiced his strong support for the Con\nference Report. 132 Cong. Rec. 16823\u201316825 (1986) (Sen\nate); id., at 17607\u201317612 (House). The upshot is that\nMembers of both Houses of Congress voted to adopt both\nthe statutory text before us and the Conference Report\nthat made clear that the statute\u2019s words include the expert\ncosts here in question.\n                          B\n  The Act\u2019s basic purpose further supports interpreting\n6     ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST.

See Brief for Respondents\n28, n. 17 (collecting District Court decisions awarding\nexpert costs ranging from $200 to $7,600, and noting three\nreported cases in which expert awards exceeded $10,000).\nThe costs of experts may not make much of a dent in a\nschool district\u2019s budget, as many of the experts they use in\nIDEA proceedings are already on the staff. Cf. Oberti v.\nBoard of Ed. Clementon School Dist., 995 F. 2d 1204, 1219\n(CA3 1993). But to parents, the award of costs may mat\nter enormously.

It says that the statute\u2019s purpose and\n\u201clegislative history is simply not enough\u201d to overcome: (1)\nthe fact that this is a Spending Clause case; (2) the text of\nthe statute; and (3) our prior cases which hold that the\nterm \u201ccosts\u201d does not include expert costs. Ante, at 12. I\ndo not find these arguments convincing.\n                              A\n   At the outset the majority says that it \u201cis guided by the\nfact that Congress enacted the IDEA pursuant to the\nSpending Clause.\u201d Ante, at 3. \u201cIn a Spending Clause\ncase,\u201d the majority adds, \u201cthe key is not what a majority of\nthe Members of both Houses intend but what the States\nare clearly told regarding the conditions that go along with\nthe acceptance of those funds.\u201d Ante, at 12. Thus, the\nstatute\u2019s \u201cconditions must be set out \u2018unambiguously.\u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 3\u20134 (citing Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.\nHalderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981) and Rowley, 458 U. S., at\n204, n. 26). And \u201c[w]e must ask\u201d whether the statute\n\u201cfurnishes clear notice regarding the liability at issue in\nthis case.\u201d Ante, at 4.\n   I agree that the statute on its face does not clearly tell\nthe States that they must pay expert fees to prevailing\nparents. But I do not agree that the majority has posed\nthe right question. For one thing, we have repeatedly\nexamined the nature and extent of the financial burdens\nthat the IDEA imposes without reference to the Spending\nClause or any \u201cclear-statement rule.\u201d See, e.g., Burling\nton, supra, at 369 (private school fees); Carter, supra, at 13\n(same); Smith, 468 U.

S. 66, 76\u201379 (1999) (continuous nursing service); but\nsee id., at 83 (THOMAS, J., joined by KENNEDY, J., dissent\ning).

To the\ncontrary, we have held that Pennhurst\u2019s requirement that\nCongress \u201cunambiguously\u201d set out \u201ca condition on the\ngrant of federal money\u201d does not necessarily apply to\nlegislation setting forth \u201cthe remedies available against a\nnoncomplying State.\u201d Bell v.

And we have denied any implication that \u201csuits\nunder Spending Clause legislation are suits in contract, or\nthat contract-law principles apply to all issues that they\nraise.\u201d Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U. S. 181, 188\u2013189, n. 2\n(2002) (emphasis added).\n   These statements and holdings are not surprising. After\nall, the basic objective of Pennhurst\u2019s clear-statement\nrequirement does not demand textual clarity in respect to\nevery detail. That is because ambiguity about the precise\nnature of a statutory program\u2019s details\u2014particularly\nwhere they are of a kind that States might have antici\npated\u2014is rarely relevant to the basic question: Would the\nStates have accepted the Federal Government\u2019s funds had\nthey only known the nature of the accompanying condi\ntions? Often, the later filling-in of details through judicial\ninterpretation will not lead one to wonder whether fund\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          11\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ning recipients would have agreed to enter the basic pro\ngram at all. Given the nature of such details, it is clear\nthat the States would have entered the program regard\nless. At the same time, to view each statutory detail of a\nhighly complex federal/state program (involving say,\ntransportation, schools, the environment) simply through\nthe lens of linguistic clarity, rather than to assess its\nmeanings in terms of basic legislative purpose, is to risk a\nset of judicial interpretations that can prevent the pro\ngram, overall, from achieving its basic objectives or that\nmight well reduce a program in its details to incoherence.\n   This case is about just such a detail. Permitting parents\nto recover expert fees will not lead to awards of \u201cindeter\nminate magnitude, untethered to compensable harm\u201d and\nconsequently will not \u201cpose a concern that recipients of\nfederal funding could not reasonably have anticipated.\u201d\nBarnes, 536 U. S., at 191 (SOUTER, J., joined by O\u2019Connor,\nJ., concurring) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted). Unlike, say, punitive damages, an award of\ncosts to expert parties is neither \u201cunorthodox\u201d nor \u201cinde\nterminate,\u201d and thus does not throw into doubt whether\nthe States would have entered into the program. Id., at\n188. If determinations as to whether the IDEA requires\nStates to provide continuing nursing services, Cedar Rap\nids, supra, or reimbursement for private school tuition,\nBurlington, supra, do not call for linguistic clarity, then\nthe precise content of recoverable \u201ccosts\u201d does not call for\nsuch clarity here a fortiori.\n                           B\n  If the Court believes that the statute\u2019s language is\nunambiguous, I must disagree. The provision at issue\nsays that a court \u201cmay award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as\npart of the costs\u201d to parents who prevail in an action\nbrought under the Act. 20 U. S. C. A. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B) (Supp.\n2006). The statute neither defines the word \u201ccosts\u201d nor\n12    ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                       MURPHY                                \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\npoints to any other source of law for a definition. And the\nword \u201ccosts,\u201d alone, says nothing at all about which costs\nfalls within its scope.\n   Neither does the statutory phrase\u2014\u201cas part of the costs\nto the parents of a child with a disability who is the pre\nvailing party\u201d\u2014taken in its entirety unambiguously fore\nclose an award of expert fees. I agree that, read literally,\nthat provision does not clearly grant authority to award\nany costs at all. And one might read it, as the Court does,\nas referencing another federal statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71920,\nwhich provides that authority. See ante, at 5; see also\n\u00a71920 (federal taxation of cost statute). But such a read\ning is not inevitable. The provision (indeed, the entire\nAct) says nothing about that other statute. And one can,\nconsistent with the language, read the provision as both\nembodying a general authority to award costs while also\nspecifying the inclusion of \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d as\npart of those costs (as saying, for example, that a court\n\u201cmay award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of [a] costs\n[award]\u201d).\n   This latter reading, while linguistically the less natural,\nis legislatively the more likely. The majority\u2019s alternative\nreading, by cross-referencing only the federal general cost-\nawarding statute (which applies solely in federal courts),\nwould produce a jumble of different cost definitions appli\ncable to similar IDEA administrative and state-court\nproceedings in different States. See \u00a71920 (\u201cA judge or\nclerk of any court of the United States may tax as costs the\nfollowing. . . .\u201d (emphasis added)). This result is particu\nlarly odd, as all IDEA actions must begin in state due\nprocess hearings, where the federal cost statute clearly\ndoes not apply, and the overwhelming majority of these\nactions are never appealed to any court.

Rather, the majority says that \u201ccosts\u201d is a term of art.\nIn light of the law\u2019s long practice of excluding expert fees\nfrom the scope of the word \u201ccosts,\u201d along with this Court\u2019s\ncases interpreting the word similarly in other statutes, the\n\u201clegislative history is simply not enough.\u201d Ante, at 12.\n   I am perfectly willing to assume that the majority is\ncorrect about the traditional scope of the word \u201ccosts.\u201d In\ntwo cases this Court has held that the word \u201ccosts\u201d is\nlimited to the list set forth in 28 U. S. C. \u00a71920 and does\nnot include fees paid to experts. See Crawford Fitting Co.\nv. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437 (1987) (interpreting Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 54(d)); West Virginia Univ.

Id., at 91\u201392, n. 5 (charac\nterizing language as an \u201capparent effort to depart from\nordinary meaning and to define a term of art\u201d and noting\nthat Congress made no such \u201ceffort\u201d in respect to 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71988).\n   Regardless, here the statute itself indicates that Con\ngress did not intend to use the word \u201ccosts\u201d as a term of\nart. The HCPA, which added the cost-shifting provision\n(in \u00a72) to the IDEA, also added another provision (in \u00a74)\ndirecting the GAO to \u201cconduct a study of the impact of the\namendments to the [IDEA] made by section 2\u201d over a 31\u20442\nyear period following the Act\u2019s effective date. \u00a74(a), 100\nStat. 797.

Nor does the federal costs statute cover any\nexpenses\u2014at least not any that Congress could have\nwanted the GAO to study. Cf. 28 U. S. C. \u00a71920 (referring\nonly once to \u201cexpenses,\u201d and doing so solely to refer to\nspecial interpretation services provided in actions initiated\nby the United States).\n  Further, why did Congress, when asking the GAO (in\nthe statute itself) to study the \u201cnumbers of hours spent by\npersonnel\u201d include among those personnel both attorneys\n\u201cand consultants\u201d? Who but experts could those consult\nants be? Why would Congress want the GAO to study the\nhours that those experts \u201cspent,\u201d unless it thought that it\nwould help keep track of the \u201ccosts\u201d that the statute\nimposed?\n  Of course, one might, through speculation, find other\nanswers to these questions. One might, for example,\nimagine that Congress wanted the GAO to study the\nexpenses that payment of expert fees engendered in state-\ncourt proceedings where state, but not federal, law re\nquires that \u201c \u2018expenses\u2019 other than \u2018costs\u2019 might be receiv\nable.\u201d Ante, at 7, n. 1; but see supra, at 12-13. Or one\nmight think that the word \u201cexpenses\u201d is surplusage. Ante,\nat 7, n. 1; but see Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174\n(2001) (expressing Court\u2019s \u201c \u2018reluctan[ce] to treat statutory\nterms as surplusage in any setting,\u2019\u201d but especially when\nthey play \u201ca pivotal role in the statutory scheme\u201d). Or one\nmight believe that Congress was interested in the hours\nthese experts spent, but not in the fees they obtained.\nAnte, at 7. But these answers are not necessarily consis\ntent with the purpose of the GAO study provision, a pur\npose revealed by the language of the provision and its\nposition in the statute. Its placement and its reference to\n\u00a72 indicate that Congress ordered the study to help it keep\ntrack of the magnitude of the reimbursements that an\n16    ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DIST. BD. OF ED. v.\n\n                       MURPHY                                  \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nearlier part of the new statute (namely, \u00a72) mandated.\nSee 100 Stat. 797 (stating that purpose of GAO study was\nto determine the \u201cimpact\u201d of \u201csection 2\u201d). And the only\nreimbursement requirement that \u00a72 mandates is the\npayment of \u201ccosts.\u201d\n   But why speculate about this? We know what Congress\nintended the GAO study to cover. It told the GAO in its\nConference Report that the word \u201ccosts\u201d included the costs\nof experts. And, not surprisingly, the GAO made clear\nthat it understood precisely what Congress asked it to do.\nIn its final report, the GAO wrote: \u201cParents can receive\nreimbursement from state or local education agencies for\nsome or all of their attorney fees and related expenses if\nthey are the prevailing party in part or all of administra\ntive hearings or court proceedings. Expert witness fees,\ncosts of tests or evaluations found to be necessary during\nthe case, and court costs for services rendered during ad\nministrative and court proceedings are examples of reim\nbursable expenses.\u201d GAO, Briefing Report to Congres\nsional Requesters, Special Education: The Attorney Fees\nProvision of Public Law 99\u2013372 GAO/HRD\u201322BR, p. 13\n(Nov. 1989). At the very least, this amounts to some indi\ncation that Congress intended the word \u201ccosts,\u201d not as a\nterm of art, not as it was used in the statutes at issue in\nCasey and Crawford Fitting, but rather as including cer\ntain additional \u201cexpenses.\u201d If that is so, the claims of\ntradition, of the interpretation this Court has given other\nstatutes, cannot be so strong as to prevent us from exam\nining the legislative history. And that history could not be\nmore clear about the matter: Congress intended the\nstatutory phrase \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs\u201d to\ninclude the costs of experts.

And our ultimate\njudicial goal is to interpret language in light of the statute\u2019s\npurpose. Only by seeking that purpose can we avoid the\nsubstitution of judicial for legislative will. Only by reading\nlanguage in its light can we maintain the democratic link\nbetween voters, legislators, statutes, and ultimate imple\nmentation, upon which the legitimacy of our constitutional\nsystem rests.\n   In my view, to keep faith with that interpretive goal, we\nmust retain all traditional interpretive tools\u2014text, struc\nture, history, and purpose. And, because faithful interpre\ntation is art as well as science, we cannot, through rule or\ncanon, rule out the use of any of these tools, automatically\nand in advance. Cf. Helvering v. Gregory, 69 F. 2d 809,\n810\u2013811 (CA2 1934) (L. Hand, J.).\n   Nothing in the Constitution forbids us from giving\nsignificant weight to legislative history. By disregarding a\nclear statement in a legislative report adopted without\nopposition in both Houses of Congress, the majority has\nreached a result no Member of Congress expected or\novertly desired. It has adopted an interpretation that\nundercuts, rather than furthers, the statute\u2019s purpose, a\n\u201cfree\u201d and \u201cappropriate\u201d public education for \u201call\u201d children\nwith disabilities.
