Argued February 28, 2006—Decided June 26, 2006*\nVermont’s Act 64 stringently limits both the amounts that candidates\n  for state office may spend on their campaigns and the amounts that\n  individuals, organizations, and political parties may contribute to\n  those campaigns. Soon after Act 64 became law, the petitioners—\n  individuals who have run for state office, citizens who vote in state\n  elections and contribute to campaigns, and political parties and\n  committees participating in state politics—brought this suit against\n  the respondents, state officials charged with enforcing the Act. The\n  District Court held that Act 64’s expenditure limits violate the First\n  Amendment, see Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, and that the Act’s lim\n  its on political parties’ contributions to candidates were unconstitu\n  tional, but found the other contribution limits constitutional. The\n  Second Circuit held that all of the Act’s contribution limits are consti\n  tutional, ruled that the expenditure limits may be constitutional be\n  cause they are supported by compelling interests in preventing cor\n  ruption or its appearance and in limiting the time state officials must\n  spend raising campaign funds, and remanded for the District Court\n  to determine whether the expenditure limits were narrowly tailored\n  to those interests.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the cases are remanded.\n382 F. 3d 91, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE BREYER, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE ALITO,\n  concluded in Parts I, II–B–3, III, and IV that both of Act 64’s sets of\n\n——————\n   * Together with No. 04–1530, Vermont Republican State Committee\net al. v.

SORRELL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    limitations are inconsistent with the First Amendment. Pp. 6–8, 10–\n    29.\n       1. The expenditure limits violate the First Amendment’s free\n    speech guarantees under Buckley. Pp. 6–8, 10–11.\n          (a) In Buckley, the Court held, inter alia, that the Government’s\n    asserted interest in preventing “corruption and the appearance of\n    corruption,” 424 U. S., at 25, provided sufficient justification for the\n    contribution limitations imposed on campaigns for federal office by\n    the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, id., at 23–38, but that\n    FECA’s expenditure limitations violated the First Amendment, id., at\n    39–59. The Court explained that the difference between the two\n    kinds of limitations is that expenditure limits “impose significantly\n    more severe restrictions on protected freedoms of political expression\n    and association than” do contribution limits. Id., at 23. Contribution\n    limits, though a “marginal restriction,” nevertheless leave the con\n    tributor “fre[e] to discuss candidates and issues.” Id., at 20–21. Ex\n    penditure limits, by contrast, impose “[a] restriction on the amount of\n    money a person or group can spend on political communication,” id.,\n    at 19, and thereby necessarily “reduc[e] the quantity of expression by\n    restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their explora\n    tion, and the size of the audience reached,” ibid. For over 30 years, in\n    considering the constitutionality of a host of campaign finance stat\n    utes, this Court has adhered to Buckley’s constraints, including those\n    on expenditure limits. See, e.g., McConnell v. Federal Election\n    Comm’n, 540 U. S. 93, 134. Pp. 6–8.\n          (b) The respondents argue unpersuasively that Buckley should be\n    distinguished from the present cases on a ground they say Buckley\n    did not consider: that expenditure limits help to protect candidates\n    from spending too much time raising money rather than devoting\n    that time to campaigning among ordinary voters. There is no signifi\n    cant basis for that distinction. Act 64’s expenditure limits are not\n    substantially different from those at issue in Buckley. Nor is Ver\n    mont’s primary justification for imposing its expenditure limits sig\n    nificantly different from Congress’ rationale for the Buckley limits:\n    preventing corruption and its appearance. The respondents say un\n    persuasively that, had the Buckley Court considered the time protec\n    tion rationale for expenditure limits, the Court would have upheld\n    those limits in the FECA. The Buckley Court, however, was aware of\n    the connection between expenditure limits and a reduction in fund-\n    raising time. And, in any event, the connection seems perfectly obvi\n    ous. Under these circumstances, the respondents’ argument amounts\n    to no more than an invitation so to limit Buckley’s holding as effec\n    tively to overrule it. That invitation is declined. Pp. 10–11.\n       2. Act 64’s contribution limits violate the First Amendment because\n                   Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nthose limits, in their specific details, burden protected interests in a\nmanner disproportionate to the public purposes they were enacted to\nadvance. Pp. 11–29.\n      (a) In upholding the $1,000 contribution limit before it, the Buck\nley Court recognized, inter alia, that such limits, unlike expenditure\nlimits, “involv[e] little direct restraint on” the contributor’s speech,\n424 U. S., at 21, and are permissible as long as the government dem\nonstrates that they are “closely drawn” to match a “sufficiently im\nportant interest,” id., at 25. It found that the interest there ad\nvanced, “prevent[ing] corruption” and its “appearance,” was\n“sufficiently important” to justify the contribution limits, id., at 25–\n26, and that those limits were “closely drawn.” Although recognizing\nthat, in determining whether a particular contribution limit was\n“closely drawn,” the amount, or level, of that limit could make a dif\nference, see id., at 21, the Court added that such “distinctions in de\ngree become significant only when they . . . amount to differences in\nkind,” id., at 30. Pointing out that it had “no scalpel to probe,\nwhether, say, a $2,000 ceiling might not serve as well as $1,000,”\nibid., the Court found “no indication” that FECA’s contribution limi\ntations would have “any dramatic adverse effect on the funding of\ncampaigns,” id., at 21. Since Buckley, the Court has consistently up\nheld contribution limits in other statutes, but has recognized that\nsuch limits might sometimes work more harm to protected First\nAmendment interests than their anticorruption objectives could jus\ntify, see, e.g., Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377,\n395–397. Pp. 12–13.\n      (b) Although the Court has “no scalpel to probe,” 424 U. S., at 30,\nwith exactitude whether particular contribution limits are too low\nand normally defers to the legislature in that regard, it must never\ntheless recognize the existence of some lower bound, as Buckley ac\nknowledges. While the interests served by contribution limits, pre\nventing corruption and its appearance, “directly implicate the\nintegrity of our electoral process,” McConnell, supra, at 136, that does\nnot simply mean the lower the limit, the better. Contribution limits\nthat are too low also can harm the electoral process by preventing\nchallengers from mounting effective campaigns against incumbent of\nficeholders, thereby reducing democratic accountability. Where there\nis strong indication in a particular case, i.e., danger signs, that such\nrisks exist (both present in kind and likely serious in degree), courts,\nincluding appellate courts, must review the record independently and\ncarefully with an eye toward assessing the statute’s “tailoring,” i.e.,\ntoward assessing the restrictions’ proportionality. See Bose Corp. v.\nConsumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 499. Danger\nsigns that Act 64’s contribution limits may fall outside tolerable First\n4                         RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    Amendment limits are present here. They are substantially lower\n    than both the limits the Court has previously upheld and the compa\n    rable limits in force in other States. Consequently, the record must\n    be examined to determine whether Act 64’s contribution limits are\n    “closely drawn” to match the State’s interests. Pp. 13–19.\n         (c) The record demonstrates that, from a constitutional perspec\n    tive, Act 64’s contribution limits are too restrictive. Five sets of fac\n    tors, taken together, lead to the conclusion that those limits are not\n    narrowly tailored. First, the record suggests, though it does not con\n    clusively prove, that Act 64’s contribution limits will significantly re\n    strict the amount of funding available for challengers to run competi\n    tive campaigns. Second, Act 64’s insistence that a political party and\n    all of its affiliates together abide by exactly the same low $200 to\n    $400 contribution limits that apply to individual contributors threat\n    ens harm to a particularly important political right, the right to asso\n    ciate in a political party. See, e.g., California Democratic Party v.\n    Jones, 530 U. S. 567, 574. Although the Court upheld federal limits\n    on political parties’ contributions to candidates in Federal Election\n    Comm’n v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., 533 U. S.\n    431, the limits there at issue were far less problematic, for they were\n    significantly higher than Act 64’s limits, see, e.g., id., at 438–439, and\n    n. 3, and they were much higher than the federal limits on contribu\n    tions from individuals to candidates, see id., at 453. Third, Act 64’s\n    treatment of volunteer services aggravates the problem. Although\n    the Act excludes uncompensated volunteer services from its “contri\n    bution” definition, it does not exclude the expenses volunteers incur,\n    e.g., travel expenses, in the course of campaign activities. The com\n    bination of very low contribution limits and the absence of an excep\n    tion excluding volunteer expenses may well impede a campaign’s\n    ability effectively to use volunteers, thereby making it more difficult\n    for individuals to associate in this way. Cf. Buckley, supra, at 22.\n    Fourth, unlike the contribution limits upheld in Shrink, Act 64’s lim\n    its are not adjusted for inflation, but decline in real value each year.\n    A failure to index limits means that limits already suspiciously low\n    will almost inevitably become too low over time. Fifth, nowhere in\n    the record is there any special justification for Act 64’s low and re\n    strictive contribution limits. Rather, the basic justifications the State\n    has advanced in support of such limits are those present in Buckley.\n    Indeed, other things being equal, one might reasonably believe that a\n    contribution of, say, $250 (or $450) to a candidate’s campaign was\n    less likely to prove a corruptive force than the far larger contribu\n    tions at issue in the other campaign finance cases the Court has con\n    sidered. Pp. 19–28.\n         (d) It is not possible to sever some of the Act’s contribution limit\n                   Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                     5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nprovisions from others that might remain fully operative. Doing so\nwould require the Court to write words into the statute (inflation in\ndexing), to leave gaping loopholes (no limits on party contributions),\nor to foresee which of many different possible ways the Vermont Leg\nislature might respond to the constitutional objections to Act 64. In\nthese circumstances, the legislature likely would not have intended\nthe Court to set aside the statute’s contribution limits. The legisla\nture is free to rewrite those provisions to address the constitutional\ndifficulties here identified. Pp. 28–29.\n   JUSTICE BREYER, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE in Parts II–B–1 and\nII–B–2, rejected the respondents’ argument that Buckley should, in\neffect, be overruled because subsequent experience has shown that\ncontribution limits alone cannot effectively deter corruption or its ap\npearance. Stare decisis, the basic legal principle commanding judicial\nrespect for a court’s earlier decisions and their rules of law, prevents\nthe overruling of Buckley. Adherence to precedent is the norm; de\nparture from it is exceptional, requiring “special justification,” Ari\nzona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212, especially where, as here, the\nprinciple at issue has become settled through iteration and reitera\ntion over a long period. There is no special justification here. Subse\nquent case law has not made Buckley a legal anomaly or otherwise\nundermined its basic legal principles. Cf. Dickerson v. United States,\n530 U. S. 428, 443. Nor is there any demonstration that circum\nstances have changed so radically as to undermine Buckley’s critical\nfactual assumptions. The respondents have not shown, for example,\nany dramatic increase in corruption or its appearance in Vermont;\nnor have they shown that expenditure limits are the only way to at\ntack that problem. Cf. McConnell, supra. Finally, overruling Buckley\nnow would dramatically undermine the considerable reliance that\nCongress and state legislatures have placed upon it in drafting cam\npaign finance laws. And this Court has followed Buckley, upholding\nand applying its reasoning in later cases. Pp. 8–10.\n   JUSTICE ALITO agreed that Act 64’s expenditure and contribution\nlimits violate the First Amendment, but concluded that respondents’\nbackup argument asking this Court to revisit Buckley v. Valeo, 424\nU. S. 1, need not be reached because they have failed to address consid\nerations of stare decisis. Pp. 1–2.\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY agreed that Vermont’s limitations on campaign\nexpenditures and contributions violate the First Amendment, but\nconcluded that, given his skepticism regarding this Court’s campaign\nfinance jurisprudence, see, e.g., McConnell v. Federal Election\nComm’n, 540 U. S. 93, 286–287, 313, it is appropriate for him to con\ncur only in the judgment. Pp. 1–3.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, agreed that Vermont’s\n6                         RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Act 64 is unconstitutional, but disagreed with the plurality’s ration\n    ale for striking down that statute. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, pro\n    vides insufficient protection to political speech, the core of the First\n    Amendment, is therefore illegitimate and not protected by stare de\n    cisis, and should be overruled and replaced with a standard faithful\n    to the Amendment. This Court erred in Buckley when it distin\n    guished between contribution and expenditure limits, finding the\n    former to be a less severe infringement on First Amendment rights.\n    See, e.g., Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377,\n    410–418. Both the contribution and expenditure restrictions of Act\n    64 should be subjected to strict scrutiny, which they would fail.

Vt.\nStat. Ann., Tit. 17, §2801 et seq. (2002). We hold that both\n2                   RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nsets of limitations are inconsistent with the First Amend\nment. Well-established precedent makes clear that the\nexpenditure limits violate the First Amendment. Buckley\nv. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 54–58 (1976) (per curiam). The\ncontribution limits are unconstitutional because in their\nspecific details (involving low maximum levels and other\nrestrictions) they fail to satisfy the First Amendment’s\nrequirement of careful tailoring. Id., at 25–30. That is to\nsay, they impose burdens upon First Amendment interests\nthat (when viewed in light of the statute’s legitimate\nobjectives) are disproportionately severe.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   Prior to 1997, Vermont’s campaign finance law imposed\nno limit upon the amount a candidate for state office could\nspend. It did, however, impose limits upon the amounts\nthat individuals, corporations, and political committees\ncould contribute to the campaign of such a candidate.\nIndividuals and corporations could contribute no more\nthan $1,000 to any candidate for state office. §2805(a)\n(1996). Political committees, excluding political parties,\ncould contribute no more than $3,000. §2805(b). The\nstatute imposed no limit on the amount that political\nparties could contribute to candidates.\n   In 1997, Vermont enacted a more stringent campaign\nfinance law, Pub. Act No. 64, codified at Vt. Stat. Ann.,\nTit. 17, §2801 et seq. (2002) (hereinafter Act or Act 64), the\nstatute at issue here. Act 64, which took effect immedi\nately after the 1998 elections, imposes mandatory expen\nditure limits on the total amount a candidate for state\noffice can spend during a “two-year general election cycle,”\ni.e., the primary plus the general election, in approxi\nmately the following amounts: governor, $300,000; lieu\ntenant governor, $100,000; other statewide offices,\n$45,000; state senator, $4,000 (plus an additional $2,500\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           3\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nfor each additional seat in the district); state representa\ntive (two-member district), $3,000; and state representa\ntive (single member district), $2,000. §2805a(a). These\nlimits are adjusted for inflation in odd-numbered years\nbased on the Consumer Price Index. §2805a(e). Incum\nbents seeking reelection to statewide office may spend no\nmore than 85% of the above amounts, and incumbents\nseeking reelection to the State Senate or House may spend\nno more than 90% of the above amounts. §2805a(c). The\nAct defines “[e]xpenditure” broadly to mean the\n    “payment, disbursement, distribution, advance, de\n    posit, loan or gift of money or anything of value, paid\n    or promised to be paid, for the purpose of influencing\n    an election, advocating a position on a public question,\n    or supporting or opposing one or more candidates.”\n    §2801(3).\nWith certain minor exceptions, expenditures over $50\nmade on a candidate’s behalf by others count against the\ncandidate’s expenditure limit if those expenditures are\n“intentionally facilitated by, solicited by or approved by”\nthe candidate’s campaign. §§2809(b), (c). These provi\nsions apply so as to count against a campaign’s expendi\nture limit any spending by political parties or committees\nthat is coordinated with the campaign and benefits the\ncandidate. And any party expenditure that “primarily\nbenefits six or fewer candidates who are associated with\nthe political party” is “presumed” to be coordinated with\nthe campaign and therefore to count against the cam\npaign’s expenditure limit. §§2809(b), (d).\n   Act 64 also imposes strict contribution limits. The\namount any single individual can contribute to the cam\npaign of a candidate for state office during a “two-year\ngeneral election cycle” is limited as follows: governor,\nlieutenant governor, and other statewide offices, $400;\nstate senator, $300; and state representative, $200.\n4                   RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n§2805(a). Unlike its expenditure limits, Act 64’s contribu\ntion limits are not indexed for inflation.\n   A political committee is subject to these same limits.\nIbid. So is a political party, ibid., defined broadly to in\nclude “any subsidiary, branch or local unit” of a party, as\nwell as any “national or regional affiliates” of a party\n(taken separately or together). §2801(5). Thus, for exam\nple, the statute treats the local, state, and national affili\nates of the Democratic Party as if they were a single entity\nand limits their total contribution to a single candidate’s\ncampaign for governor (during the primary and the gen\neral election together) to $400.\n   The Act also imposes a limit of $2,000 upon the amount\nany individual can give to a political party during a 2-year\ngeneral election cycle. §2805(a).\n   The Act defines “contribution” broadly in approximately\nthe same way it defines “expenditure.” §2801(2). Any\nexpenditure made on a candidate’s behalf counts as a\ncontribution to the candidate if it is “intentionally facili\ntated by, solicited by or approved by” the candidate.\n§§2809(a), (c). And a party expenditure that “primarily\nbenefits six or fewer candidates who are associated with\nthe” party is “presumed” to count against the party’s\ncontribution limits. §§2809(a), (d).\n   There are a few exceptions. A candidate’s own contribu\ntions to the campaign and those of the candidate’s family\nfall outside the contribution limits. §2805(f). Volunteer\nservices do not count as contributions. §2801(2). Nor does\nthe cost of a meet-the-candidate function, provided that\nthe total cost for the function amounts to $100 or less.\n§2809(d).\n   In addition to these expenditure and contribution limits,\nthe Act sets forth disclosure and reporting requirements\nand creates a voluntary public financing system for gu\nbernatorial elections. §§2803, 2811, 2821–2823, 2831,\n2832, 2851–2856. None of these is at issue here. The Act\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

The lower courts held these out-\nof-state contribution limits unconstitutional, and the\nparties do not challenge that holding.\n                             B\n   The petitioners are individuals who have run for state\noffice in Vermont, citizens who vote in Vermont elections\nand contribute to Vermont campaigns, and political par\nties and committees that participate in Vermont politics.\nSoon after Act 64 became law, they brought this lawsuit in\nFederal District Court against the respondents, state\nofficials charged with enforcement of the Act. Several\nother private groups and individual citizens intervened in\nthe District Court proceedings in support of the Act and\nare joined here as respondents as well.\n   The District Court agreed with the petitioners that the\nAct’s expenditure limits violate the First Amendment. See\nBuckley, 424 U. S. 1. The court also held unconstitutional\nthe Act’s limits on the contributions of political parties to\ncandidates. At the same time, the court found the Act’s\nother contribution limits constitutional.        Landell v.\nSorrell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

A divided panel of the Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit held that all of the Act’s\ncontribution limits are constitutional. It also held that the\nAct’s expenditure limits may be constitutional. Landell v.\nSorrell, 382 F. 3d 91 (2004). It found those limits sup\nported by two compelling interests, namely, an interest in\npreventing corruption or the appearance of corruption and\nan interest in limiting the amount of time state officials\nmust spend raising campaign funds. The Circuit then\nremanded the case to the District Court with instructions\nto determine whether the Act’s expenditure limits were\nnarrowly tailored to those interests.\n6                  RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n  The petitioners and respondents all sought certiorari.\nThey asked us to consider the constitutionality of Act 64’s\nexpenditure limits, its contribution limits, and a related\ndefinitional provision. We agreed to do so. 545 U. S. ___\n(2005).\n                           II\n  We turn first to the Act’s expenditure limits. Do\nthose limits violate the First Amendment’s free speech\nguarantees?\n                                A\n   In Buckley v. Valeo, supra, the Court considered the\nconstitutionality of the Federal Election Campaign Act of\n1971 (FECA), 86 Stat. 3, as amended, 2 U. S. C. §431 et\nseq., a statute that, much like the Act before us, imposed\nboth expenditure and contribution limitations on cam\npaigns for public office. The Court, while upholding\nFECA’s contribution limitations as constitutional, held\nthat the statute’s expenditure limitations violated the\nFirst Amendment.\n   Buckley stated that both kinds of limitations “implicate\nfundamental First Amendment interests.” 424 U. S., at\n23. It noted that the Government had sought to justify the\nstatute’s infringement on those interests in terms of the\nneed to prevent “corruption and the appearance of corrup\ntion.” Id., at 25; see also id., at 55. In the Court’s view,\nthis rationale provided sufficient justification for the\nstatute’s contribution limitations, but it did not provide\nsufficient justification for the expenditure limitations.\n   The Court explained that the basic reason for this dif\nference between the two kinds of limitations is that ex\npenditure limitations “impose significantly more severe\nrestrictions on protected freedoms of political expression\nand association than” do contribution limitations. Id., at\n23. Contribution limitations, though a “marginal restric\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ntion upon the contributor’s ability to engage in free com\nmunication,” nevertheless leave the contributor “fre[e] to\ndiscuss candidates and issues.” Id., at 20–21. Expendi\nture limitations, by contrast, impose “[a] restriction on the\namount of money a person or group can spend on political\ncommunication during a campaign.” Id., at 19. They\nthereby necessarily “reduc[e] the quantity of expression by\nrestricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of\ntheir exploration, and the size of the audience reached.”\nIbid. Indeed, the freedom “to engage in unlimited political\nexpression subject to a ceiling on expenditures is like\nbeing free to drive an automobile as far and as often as\none desires on a single tank of gasoline.” Id., at 19, n. 18.\n   The Court concluded that “[n]o governmental interest\nthat has been suggested is sufficient to justify the restric\ntion on the quantity of political expression imposed by” the\nstatute’s expenditure limitations. Id., at 55. It decided\nthat the Government’s primary justification for expendi\nture limitations, preventing corruption and its appear\nance, was adequately addressed by the Act’s contribution\nlimitations and disclosure requirements. Ibid. The Court\nalso considered other governmental interests advanced in\nsupport of expenditure limitations. It rejected each. Id.,\nat 56–57. Consequently, it held that the expenditure\nlimitations were “constitutionally invalid.” Id., at 58.\n   Over the last 30 years, in considering the constitutional\nity of a host of different campaign finance statutes, this\nCourt has repeatedly adhered to Buckley’s constraints,\nincluding those on expenditure limits. See McConnell v.\nFederal Election Comm’n, 540 U. S. 93, 134 (2003); Fed\neral Election Comm’n v. Colorado Republican Federal\nCampaign Comm., 533 U. S. 431, 441 (2001) (Colorado II);\nNixon v.

S. 182, 194–195 (1981)\n(plurality opinion).\n                              B\n                              1\n   The respondents recognize that, in respect to expendi\nture limits, Buckley appears to be a controlling—and\nunfavorable—precedent. They seek to overcome that\nprecedent in two ways. First, they ask us in effect to\noverrule Buckley. Post-Buckley experience, they believe,\nhas shown that contribution limits (and disclosure re\nquirements) alone cannot effectively deter corruption or its\nappearance; hence experience has undermined an assump\ntion underlying that case. Indeed, the respondents have\ndevoted several pages of their briefs to attacking Buckley’s\nholding on expenditure limits. See Brief for Respondent-\nCross-Petitioner Vermont Public Interest Research Group\net al. 36–39 (arguing that “sound reasons exist to revisit\nthe applicable standard of review” for expenditure limits);\nBrief for Respondent-Cross-Petitioner William Sorrell\net al. 28–31 (arguing that “the Court should revisit Buck\nley and consider alternative constitutional approaches to\nspending limits”).\n   Second, in the alternative, they ask us to limit the scope\nof Buckley significantly by distinguishing Buckley from the\npresent case. They advance as a ground for distinction a\njustification for expenditure limitations that, they say,\nBuckley did not consider, namely that such limits help to\nprotect candidates from spending too much time raising\nmoney rather than devoting that time to campaigning\namong ordinary voters. We find neither argument\npersuasive.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            9\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n                              2\n  The Court has often recognized the “fundamental impor\ntance” of stare decisis, the basic legal principle that com\nmands judicial respect for a court’s earlier decisions and\nthe rules of law they embody. See Harris v. United States,\n536 U. S. 545, 556–557 (2002) (plurality opinion) (citing\nnumerous cases). The Court has pointed out that stare\ndecisis “ ‘promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and con\nsistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on\njudicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and per\nceived integrity of the judicial process.’ ” United States v.\nInternational Business Machines Corp., 517 U. S. 843, 856\n(1996) (quoting Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827\n(1991)). Stare decisis thereby avoids the instability and\nunfairness that accompany disruption of settled legal\nexpectations. For this reason, the rule of law demands\nthat adhering to our prior case law be the norm. Depar\nture from precedent is exceptional, and requires “special\njustification.” Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212\n(1984). This is especially true where, as here, the princi\nple has become settled through iteration and reiteration\nover a long period of time.\n  We can find here no such special justification that would\nrequire us to overrule Buckley. Subsequent case law has\nnot made Buckley a legal anomaly or otherwise under\nmined its basic legal principles. Cf. Dickerson v. United\nStates, 530 U. S. 428, 443 (2000). We cannot find in the\nrespondents’ claims any demonstration that circumstances\nhave changed so radically as to undermine Buckley’s\ncritical factual assumptions. The respondents have not\nshown, for example, any dramatic increase in corruption\nor its appearance in Vermont; nor have they shown that\nexpenditure limits are the only way to attack that prob\nlem. Cf. McConnell v. FEC, 540 U. S. 93. At the same\ntime, Buckley has promoted considerable reliance. Con\ngress and state legislatures have used Buckley when\n10                 RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ndrafting campaign finance laws. And, as we have said,\nthis Court has followed Buckley, upholding and applying\nits reasoning in later cases. Overruling Buckley now\nwould dramatically undermine this reliance on our settled\nprecedent.\n   For all these reasons, we find this a case that fits the\nstare decisis norm. And we do not perceive the strong\njustification that would be necessary to warrant overrul\ning so well established a precedent. We consequently\ndecline the respondents’ invitation to reconsider Buckley.\n                               3\n   The respondents also ask us to distinguish these cases\nfrom Buckley. But we can find no significant basis for that\ndistinction. Act 64’s expenditure limits are not substan\ntially different from those at issue in Buckley. In both\ninstances the limits consist of a dollar cap imposed upon a\ncandidate’s expenditures. Nor is Vermont’s primary justi\nfication for imposing its expenditure limits significantly\ndifferent from Congress’ rationale for the Buckley limits:\npreventing corruption and its appearance.\n   The sole basis on which the respondents seek to distin\nguish Buckley concerns a further supporting justification.\nThey argue that expenditure limits are necessary in order\nto reduce the amount of time candidates must spend\nraising money.      Brief for Respondent/Cross-Petitioner\nVermont Public Interest Research Group et al. 16–20;\nBrief for Respondent/Cross-Petitioner William H. Sorrell\net al. 22–25. Increased campaign costs, together with the\nfear of a better-funded opponent, mean that, without\nexpenditure limits, a candidate must spend too much time\nraising money instead of meeting the voters and engaging\nin public debate. Buckley, the respondents add, did not\nfully consider this justification. Had it done so, they say,\nthe Court would have upheld, not struck down, FECA’s\nexpenditure limits.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           11\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n   In our view, it is highly unlikely that fuller considera\ntion of this time protection rationale would have changed\nBuckley’s result. The Buckley Court was aware of the\nconnection between expenditure limits and a reduction in\nfundraising time. In a section of the opinion dealing with\nFECA’s public financing provisions, it wrote that Congress\nwas trying to “free candidates from the rigors of fundrais\ning.” 424 U. S., at 91; see also id., at 96 (“[L]imits on\ncontributions necessarily increase the burden of fundrais\ning,” and “public financing” was designed in part to relieve\nPresidential candidates “from the rigors of soliciting pri\nvate contributions”); id., at 258–259 (White, J., concurring\nin part and dissenting in part) (same). The Court of Ap\npeals’ opinion and the briefs filed in this Court pointed out\nthat a natural consequence of higher campaign expendi\ntures was that “candidates were compelled to allow to fund\nraising increasing and extreme amounts of money and\nenergy.” Buckley v. Valeo, 519 F. 2d 821, 838 (CADC\n1975); see also Brief for United States et al. as Amici\nCuriae in Buckley v. Valeo, O. T. 1975, Nos. 75–436 and\n75–437, p. 36 (“Fund raising consumes candidate time\nthat otherwise would be devoted to campaigning”). And,\nin any event, the connection between high campaign ex\npenditures and increased fundraising demands seems\nperfectly obvious.\n   Under these circumstances, the respondents’ argument\namounts to no more than an invitation so to limit Buck\nley’s holding as effectively to overrule it. For the reasons\nset forth above, we decline that invitation as well. And,\ngiven Buckley’s continued authority, we must con\nclude that Act 64’s expenditure limits violate the First\nAmendment.\n                             III\n  We turn now to a more complex question, namely the\nconstitutionality of Act 64’s contribution limits. The par\n12                  RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nties, while accepting Buckley’s approach, dispute whether,\ndespite Buckley’s general approval of statutes that limit\ncampaign contributions, Act 64’s contribution limits are so\nsevere that in the circumstances its particular limits\nviolate the First Amendment.\n                               A\n   As with the Act’s expenditure limits, we begin with\nBuckley. In that case, the Court upheld the $1,000 contri\nbution limit before it. Buckley recognized that contribu\ntion limits, like expenditure limits, “implicate fundamen\ntal First Amendment interests,” namely, the freedoms of\n“political expression” and “political association.” 424 U. S.,\nat 15, 23. But, unlike expenditure limits (which “necessar\nily reduc[e] the quantity of expression by restricting the\nnumber of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration,\nand the size of the audience reached,” id., at 19), contribu\ntion limits “involv[e] little direct restraint on” the con\ntributor’s speech, id., at 21. They do restrict “one aspect of\nthe contributor’s freedom of political association,” namely,\nthe contributor’s ability to support a favored candidate,\nbut they nonetheless “permi[t] the symbolic expression of\nsupport evidenced by a contribution,” and they do “not in\nany way infringe the contributor’s freedom to discuss\ncandidates and issues.” Id., at 21, 24.\n   Consequently, the Court wrote, contribution limitations\nare permissible as long as the Government demonstrates\nthat the limits are “closely drawn” to match a “sufficiently\nimportant interest.” Id., at 25. It found that the interest\nadvanced in the case, “prevent[ing] corruption” and its\n“appearance,” was “sufficiently important” to justify the\nstatute’s contribution limits. Id., at 25–26.\n   The Court also found that the contribution limits before\nit were “closely drawn.” It recognized that, in determining\nwhether a particular contribution limit was “closely\ndrawn,” the amount, or level, of that limit could make a\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           13\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ndifference. Indeed, it wrote that “contribution restrictions\ncould have a severe impact on political dialogue if the\nlimitations prevented candidates and political committees\nfrom amassing the resources necessary for effective advo\ncacy.” Id., at 21. But the Court added that such “distinc\ntions in degree become significant only when they can be\nsaid to amount to differences in kind.” Id., at 30. Pointing\nout that it had “no scalpel to probe, whether, say, a $2,000\nceiling might not serve as well as $1,000,” ibid., the Court\nfound “no indication” that the $1,000 contribution limita\ntions imposed by the Act would have “any dramatic ad\nverse effect on the funding of campaigns,” id., at 21. It\ntherefore found the limitations constitutional.\n   Since Buckley, the Court has consistently upheld contri\nbution limits in other statutes. Shrink, 528 U. S. 377\n($1075 limit on contributions to candidates for Missouri\nstate auditor); California Medical Assn., 453 U. S. 182\n($5,000 limit on contributions to multicandidate political\ncommittees). The Court has recognized, however, that\ncontribution limits might sometimes work more harm to\nprotected First Amendment interests than their anticor\nruption objectives could justify. See Shrink, supra, at\n395–397; Buckley, supra, at 21. And individual Members\nof the Court have expressed concern lest too low a limit\nmagnify the “reputation-related or media-related advan\ntages of incumbency and thereby insulat[e] legislators\nfrom effective electoral challenge.” Shrink, supra, at 403–\n404 (BREYER, J., joined by GINSBURG, J., concurring). In\nthe cases before us, the petitioners challenge Act 64’s\ncontribution limits on that basis.\n                             B\n  Following Buckley, we must determine whether Act 64’s\ncontribution limits prevent candidates from “amassing the\nresources necessary for effective [campaign] advocacy,”\n424 U. S., at 21; whether they magnify the advantages of\n14                  RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nincumbency to the point where they put challengers to a\nsignificant disadvantage; in a word, whether they are too\nlow and too strict to survive First Amendment scrutiny.\nIn answering these questions, we recognize, as Buckley\nstated, that we have “no scalpel to probe” each possible\ncontribution level. Id., at 30. We cannot determine with\nany degree of exactitude the precise restriction necessary\nto carry out the statute’s legitimate objectives. In practice,\nthe legislature is better equipped to make such empirical\njudgments, as legislators have “particular expertise” in\nmatters related to the costs and nature of running for\noffice. McConnell, 540 U. S., at 137. Thus ordinarily we\nhave deferred to the legislature’s determination of such\nmatters.\n   Nonetheless, as Buckley acknowledged, we must recog\nnize the existence of some lower bound. At some point the\nconstitutional risks to the democratic electoral process\nbecome too great. After all, the interests underlying con\ntribution limits, preventing corruption and the appearance\nof corruption, “directly implicate the integrity of our elec\ntoral process.” McConnell, supra, at 136 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted). Yet that rationale does not simply\nmean “the lower the limit, the better.” That is because\ncontribution limits that are too low can also harm the\nelectoral process by preventing challengers from mounting\neffective campaigns against incumbent officeholders,\nthereby reducing democratic accountability. Were we to\nignore that fact, a statute that seeks to regulate campaign\ncontributions could itself prove an obstacle to the very\nelectoral fairness it seeks to promote. Thus, we see no\nalternative to the exercise of independent judicial judg\nment as a statute reaches those outer limits. And, where\nthere is strong indication in a particular case, i.e., danger\nsigns, that such risks exist (both present in kind and likely\nserious in degree), courts, including appellate courts, must\nreview the record independently and carefully with an eye\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           15\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ntoward assessing the statute’s “tailoring,” that is, toward\nassessing the proportionality of the restrictions. See Bose\nCorp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U. S.\n485, 499 (1984) (“[A]n appellate court has an obligation to\n‘make an independent examination of the whole record’ in\norder to make sure that ‘the judgment does not constitute\na forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression’ ”\n(quoting New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254,\n284–286 (1964))).\n  We find those danger signs present here. As compared\nwith the contribution limits upheld by the Court in the\npast, and with those in force in other States, Act 64’s\nlimits are sufficiently low as to generate suspicion that\nthey are not closely drawn. The Act sets its limits per\nelection cycle, which includes both a primary and a gen\neral election. Thus, in a gubernatorial race with both\nprimary and final election contests, the Act’s contribution\nlimit amounts to $200 per election per candidate (with\nsignificantly lower limits for contributions to candidates\nfor State Senate and House of Representatives, see supra,\nat 3). These limits apply both to contributions from indi\nviduals and to contributions from political parties,\nwhether made in cash or in expenditures coordinated (or\npresumed to be coordinated) with the candidate. See\nsupra, at 3–4.\n  These limits are well below the limits this Court upheld\nin Buckley. Indeed, in terms of real dollars (i.e., adjusting\nfor inflation), the Act’s $200 per election limit on individ\nual contributions to a campaign for governor is slightly\nmore than one-twentieth of the limit on contributions to\ncampaigns for federal office before the Court in Buckley.\nAdjusted to reflect its value in 1976 (the year Buckley was\ndecided), Vermont’s contribution limit on campaigns for\nstatewide office (including governor) amounts to $113.91\nper 2-year election cycle, or roughly $57 per election, as\ncompared to the $1,000 per election limit on individual\n16                  RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ncontributions at issue in Buckley. (The adjusted value of\nAct 64’s limit on contributions from political parties to\ncandidates for statewide office, again $200 per candidate\nper election, is just over one one-hundredth of the compa\nrable limit before the Court in Buckley, $5,000 per elec\ntion.) Yet Vermont’s gubernatorial district—the entire\nState—is no smaller than the House districts to which\nBuckley’s limits applied. In 1976, the average congres\nsional district contained a population of about 465,000.\nDept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract\nof the United States 459 (1976) (Statistical Abstract)\n(describing results of 1970 census). Indeed, Vermont’s\npopulation is 621,000—about one-third larger. Statistical\nAbstract 21 (2006) (describing Vermont’s population in\n2004).\n   Moreover, considered as a whole, Vermont’s contribution\nlimits are the lowest in the Nation. Act 64 limits contribu\ntions to candidates for statewide office (including gover\nnor) to $200 per candidate per election. We have found no\nState that imposes a lower per election limit. Indeed, we\nhave found only seven States that impose limits on contri\nbutions to candidates for statewide office at or below $500\nper election, more than twice Act 64’s limit. Cf. Ariz. Rev.\nStat. Ann. §16–905 (West Cum. Supp. 2005) ($760 per\nelection cycle, or $380 per election, adjusted for inflation);\nColo. Const., Art. XXVIII, §3 ($500 per election, adjusted\nfor inflation); Fla.

Codified Laws §12–25–\n1.1 (2004) ($1,000 per year, or $500 per election).

Similarly, we\nhave found only three States that have limits on contribu\ntions to candidates for state legislature below Act 64’s\n$150 and $100 per election limits. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n§16–905 (West Cum. Supp. 2005) ($296 per election cycle,\nor $148 per election); Mont. Code Ann. §13–37–216(1)(a)\n(2005) ($130 per election); S. D. Codified Laws §12–25–1.1\n(2004) ($250 per year, or $125 per election). And we are\naware of no State that has a lower limit on contributions\nfrom political parties to state legislative candidates.

Ann., Tit. 21A, §1015(1) (1993) (next lowest:\n$250 per election).\n   Finally, Vermont’s limit is well below the lowest limit\nthis Court has previously upheld, the limit of $1,075 per\nelection (adjusted for inflation every two years, see Mo.\nRev. Stat. §130.032.2 (1998 Cum. Supp.)) for candidates\nfor Missouri state auditor. Shrink, 528 U. S. 377. The\ncomparable Vermont limit of roughly $200 per election,\nnot adjusted for inflation, is less than one-sixth of Mis\nsouri’s current inflation-adjusted limit ($1,275).\n   We recognize that Vermont’s population is much smaller\nthan Missouri’s. Indeed, Vermont is about one-ninth of\nthe size of Missouri. Statistical Abstract 21 (2006). Thus,\nper citizen, Vermont’s limit is slightly more generous. As\nof 2006, the ratio of the contribution limit to the size of the\nconstituency in Vermont is .00064, while Missouri’s ratio\nis .00044, 31% lower. Cf. App. 55 (doing same calculation\nin 2000).\n   But this does not necessarily mean that Vermont’s\nlimits are less objectionable than the limit upheld in\nShrink. A campaign for state auditor is likely to be less\ncostly than a campaign for governor; campaign costs do\n18                 RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nnot automatically increase or decrease in precise propor\ntion to the size of an electoral district. See App. 66 (1998\nwinning candidate for Vermont state auditor spent about\n$60,000; winning candidate for governor spent about\n$340,000); Opensecrets.org, The Big Picture, 2004 Cycle:\nHot Races, available at http://www.opensecrets.org/\nbigpicture/hotraces.asp?cycle=2004 (as visited June 22,\n2006, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file) (U. S.\nSenate campaigns identified as competitive spend less per\nvoter than U. S. House campaigns identified as competi\ntive). Moreover, Vermont’s limits, unlike Missouri’s lim\nits, apply in the same amounts to contributions made by\npolitical parties. Mo. Rev. Stat. §130.032.4 (2000) (enact\ning limits on contributions from political parties to candi\ndates 10 times higher than limits on contributions from\nindividuals). And, as we have said, Missouri’s (current)\n$1,275 per election limit, unlike Vermont’s $200 per elec\ntion limit, is indexed for inflation. See supra, at 17; see\nalso Mo. Rev. Stat. §130.032.2 (2000).\n    The factors we have mentioned offset any neutralizing\nforce of population differences. At the very least, they\nmake it difficult to treat Shrink’s (then) $1,075 limit as\nproviding affirmative support for the lawfulness of Ver\nmont’s far lower levels. Cf. 528 U. S., at 404 (BREYER, J.,\nconcurring) (The Shrink “limit . . . is low enough to raise\n. . . a [significant constitutional] question”). And even\nwere that not so, Vermont’s failure to index for inflation\nmeans that Vermont’s levels would soon be far lower than\nMissouri’s regardless of the method of comparison.\n    In sum, Act 64’s contribution limits are substantially\nlower than both the limits we have previously upheld and\ncomparable limits in other States. These are danger signs\nthat Act 64’s contribution limits may fall outside tolerable\nFirst Amendment limits. We consequently must examine\nthe record independently and carefully to determine\nwhether Act 64’s contribution limits are “closely drawn” to\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          19\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nmatch the State’s interests.\n                               C\n   Our examination of the record convinces us that, from a\nconstitutional perspective, Act 64’s contribution limits are\ntoo restrictive. We reach this conclusion based not merely\non the low dollar amounts of the limits themselves, but\nalso on the statute’s effect on political parties and on\nvolunteer activity in Vermont elections. Taken together,\nAct 64’s substantial restrictions on the ability of candi\ndates to raise the funds necessary to run a competitive\nelection, on the ability of political parties to help their\ncandidates get elected, and on the ability of individual\ncitizens to volunteer their time to campaigns show that\nthe Act is not closely drawn to meet its objectives. In\nparticular, five factors together lead us to this decision.\n   First, the record suggests, though it does not conclu\nsively prove, that Act 64’s contribution limits will signifi\ncantly restrict the amount of funding available for chal\nlengers to run competitive campaigns. For one thing, the\npetitioners’ expert, Clark Bensen, conducted a race-by\nrace analysis of the 1998 legislative elections (the last to\ntake place before Act 64 took effect) and concluded that\nAct 64’s contribution limits would have reduced the funds\navailable in 1998 to Republican challengers in competitive\nraces in amounts ranging from 18% to 53% of their total\ncampaign income. See 3 Tr. 52–57 (estimating loss of 47%\nof funds for candidate Tully, 50% for Harvey, 53% for\nWelch, 19% for Bahre, 29% for Delaney, 36% for LaRoc\nque, 18% for Smith, and 31% for Brown).\n   For another thing, the petitioners’ expert witnesses\nproduced evidence and analysis showing that Vermont\npolitical parties (particularly the Republican Party) “tar\nget” their contributions to candidates in competitive races,\nthat those contributions represent a significant amount of\ntotal candidate funding in such races, and that the contri\n20                  RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nbution limits will cut the parties’ contributions to competi\ntive races dramatically. See 1 id., at 189–190; 3 id., at 50–\n51; 8 id., at 139; 10 id., at 150; see also, e.g., Gierzynski &\nBreaux, The Role of Parties in Legislative Campaign\nFinancing, 15 Am. Rev. Politics 171 (1994); Thompson,\nCassie, & Jewell, A Sacred Cow or Just a Lot of Bull?\nParty and PAC Money in State Legislative Elections, 47\nPol. Sci. Q. 223 (1994). Their statistics showed that the\nparty contributions accounted for a significant percentage\nof the total campaign income in those races. And their\nstudies showed that Act 64’s contribution limits would cut\nthe party contributions by between 85% (for the legisla\nture on average) and 99% (for governor).\n   More specifically, Bensen pointed out that in 1998, the\nRepublican Party made contributions to 19 Senate cam\npaigns in amounts that averaged $2,001, which on average\nrepresented 16% of the recipient campaign’s total income.\n3 Tr. 84. Act 64 would reduce these contributions to $300\nper campaign, an average reduction of about 85%. Ibid.\nThe party contributed to 50 House campaigns in amounts\naveraging $787, which on average represented 28% of the\nrecipient campaign’s total income. Id., at 85. Act 64\nwould reduce these contributions to $200 per campaign,\nan average reduction of 74.5%. Ibid. And the party con\ntributed $40,600 to its gubernatorial candidate, an\namount that accounted for about 16% of the candidate’s\nfunding. Id., at 86. The Act would have reduced that\ncontribution by 99%, to $400.\n   Bensen added that 57% of all 1998 Senate campaigns\nand 30% of all House campaigns exceeded Act 64’s expen\nditure limits, which were enacted along with the statute’s\ncontribution limits. 7 Trial Exhs. in No. 00–9159(L) etc.\n(CA2), Exh. 8, p. 2351. Moreover, 27% of all Senate cam\npaigns and 10% of all House campaigns spent more than\ndouble those limits. Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           21\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n   The respondents did not contest these figures. Rather,\nthey presented evidence that focused, not upon strongly\ncontested campaigns, but upon the funding amounts avail\nable for the average campaign. The respondents’ expert,\nAnthony Gierzynski, concluded, for example, that Act 64\nwould have a “minimal effect on . . . candidates’ ability to\nraise funds.” App. 46. But he rested this conclusion upon\nhis finding that “only a small proportion of” all contribu\ntions to all campaigns for state office “made during the\nlast three elections would have been affected by the new\nlimits.” Id., at 47; see also id., at 51 (discussing “average\namount of revenues lost to the limits” in legislative races\n(emphasis added)); id., at 52–53 (discussing total number\nof campaigns receiving contributions over Act 64’s limit).\nThe lower courts similarly relied almost exclusively on\naverages in assessing Act 64’s effect. See 118 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 470 (“Approximately 88% to 96% of the campaign con\ntributions to recent House races were under $200” (empha\nsis added)); id., at 478 (“Expert testimony revealed that\nover the last three election cycles the percentage of all\ncandidates’ contributions received over the contribution\nlimits was less than 10%” (emphasis added)).\n   The respondents’ evidence leaves the petitioners’ evi\ndence unrebutted in certain key respects. That is because\nthe critical question concerns not simply the average effect\nof contribution limits on fundraising but, more impor\ntantly, the ability of a candidate running against an in\ncumbent officeholder to mount an effective challenge. And\ninformation about average races, rather than competitive\nraces, is only distantly related to that question, because\ncompetitive races are likely to be far more expensive than\nthe average race. See, e.g., N. Ornstein, T. Mann, & M.\nMalbin, Vital Statistics on Congress 2001–2002, pp. 89–98\n(2002) (data showing that spending in competitive elec\ntions, i.e., where incumbent wins with less than 60% of\nvote or where incumbent loses, is far greater than in most\n22                  RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nelections, where incumbent wins with more than 60% of\nthe vote). We concede that the record does contain some\nanecdotal evidence supporting the respondents’ position,\nnamely, testimony about a post-Act-64 competitive may\noral campaign in Burlington, which suggests that a chal\nlenger can “amas[s] the resources necessary for effective\nadvocacy,” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 21. But the facts of that\nparticular election are not described in sufficient detail to\noffer a convincing refutation of the implication arising\nfrom the petitioners’ experts’ studies.\n  Rather, the petitioners’ studies, taken together with low\naverage Vermont campaign expenditures and the typically\nhigher costs that a challenger must bear to overcome the\nname-recognition advantage enjoyed by an incumbent,\nraise a reasonable inference that the contribution limits\nare so low that they may pose a significant obstacle to\ncandidates in competitive elections. Cf. Ornstein, supra,\nat 87–96 (In 2000 U. S. House and Senate elections, suc\ncessful challengers spent far more than the average candi\ndate). Information about average races does not rebut\nthat inference. Consequently, the inference amounts to\none factor (among others) that here counts against the\nconstitutional validity of the contribution limits.\n  Second, Act 64’s insistence that political parties abide by\nexactly the same low contribution limits that apply to\nother contributors threatens harm to a particularly impor\ntant political right, the right to associate in a political\nparty. See, e.g., California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530\nU. S. 567, 574 (2000) (describing constitutional impor\ntance of associating in political parties to elect candi\ndates); Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U. S.\n351, 357 (1997) (same); Colorado I, 518 U. S., at 616\n(same); Norman v. Reed, 502 U. S. 279, 288 (1992) (same).\nCf. Buckley, supra, at 20–22 (contribution limits constitute\n“only a marginal restriction” on First Amendment rights\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            23\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nbecause contributor remains free to associate politically,\ne.g., in a political party, and “assist personally” in the\nparty’s “efforts on behalf of candidates”).\n   The Act applies its $200 to $400 limits—precisely the\nsame limits it applies to an individual—to virtually all\naffiliates of a political party taken together as if they were\na single contributor. Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17, §2805(a)\n(2002). That means, for example, that the Vermont De\nmocratic Party, taken together with all its local affiliates,\ncan make one contribution of at most $400 to the Democ\nratic gubernatorial candidate, one contribution of at most\n$300 to a Democratic candidate for State Senate, and one\ncontribution of at most $200 to a Democratic candidate for\nthe State House of Representatives. The Act includes\nwithin these limits not only direct monetary contributions\nbut also expenditures in kind: stamps, stationery, coffee,\ndoughnuts, gasoline, campaign buttons, and so forth. See\n§2801(2). Indeed, it includes all party expenditures “in\ntended to promote the election of a specific candidate or\ngroup of candidates” as long as the candidate’s campaign\n“facilitate[s],” “solicit[s],” or “approve[s]” them. §§2809(a),\n(c). And a party expenditure that “primarily benefits six\nor fewer candidates who are associated with the” party is\n“presumed” to count against the party’s contribution\nlimits. §2809(d).\n   In addition to the negative effect on “amassing funds”\nthat we have described, see supra, at 18–21, the Act would\nseverely limit the ability of a party to assist its candidates’\ncampaigns by engaging in coordinated spending on adver\ntising, candidate events, voter lists, mass mailings, even\nyard signs. And, to an unusual degree, it would discour\nage those who wish to contribute small amounts of money\nto a party, amounts that easily comply with individual\ncontribution limits. Suppose that many individuals do not\nknow Vermont legislative candidates personally, but wish\n24                 RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nto contribute, say, $20 or $40, to the State Republican\nParty, with the intent that the party use the money to\nhelp elect whichever candidates the party believes would\nbest advance its ideals and interests—the basic object of a\npolitical party. Or, to take a more extreme example,\nimagine that 6,000 Vermont citizens each want to give $1\nto the State Democratic Party because, though unfamiliar\nwith the details of the individual races, they would like to\nmake a small financial contribution to the goal of electing\na Democratic state legislature. And further imagine that\nthe party believes control of the legislature will depend on\nthe outcome of three (and only three) House races. The\nAct forbids the party from giving $2,000 (of the $6,000) to\neach of its candidates in those pivotal races. Indeed, it\npermits the party to give no more than $200 to each can\ndidate, thereby thwarting the aims of the 6,000 donors\nfrom making a meaningful contribution to state politics by\ngiving a small amount of money to the party they support.\nThus, the Act would severely inhibit collective political\nactivity by preventing a political party from using contri\nbutions by small donors to provide meaningful assistance\nto any individual candidate. See supra, at 19.\n   We recognize that we have previously upheld limits on\ncontributions from political parties to candidates, in par\nticular the federal limits on coordinated party spending.\nColorado II, 533 U. S. 431. And we also recognize that any\nsuch limit will negatively affect to some extent the fund-\nallocating party function just described. But the contribu\ntion limits at issue in Colorado II were far less problem\natic, for they were significantly higher than Act 64’s lim\nits. See id., at 438–439, and n. 3, 442, n. 7 (at least\n$67,560 in coordinated spending and $5,000 in direct cash\ncontributions for U. S. Senate candidates, at least $33,780\nin coordinated spending and $5,000 in direct cash contri\nbutions for U. S. House candidates). And they were much\nhigher than the federal limits on contributions from indi\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)             25\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nviduals to candidates, thereby reflecting an effort by Con\ngress to balance (1) the need to allow individuals to par\nticipate in the political process by contributing to political\nparties that help elect candidates with (2) the need to\nprevent the use of political parties “to circumvent contri\nbution limits that apply to individuals.” Id., at 453. Act\n64, by placing identical limits upon contributions to candi\ndates, whether made by an individual or by a political\nparty, gives to the former consideration no weight at all.\n   We consequently agree with the District Court that the\nAct’s contribution limits “would reduce the voice of politi\ncal parties” in Vermont to a “whisper.” 118 F. Supp. 2d, at\n487. And we count the special party-related harms that\nAct 64 threatens as a further factor weighing against the\nconstitutional validity of the contribution limits.\n   Third, the Act’s treatment of volunteer services aggra\nvates the problem. Like its federal statutory counterpart,\nthe Act excludes from its definition of “contribution” all\n“services provided without compensation by individuals\nvolunteering their time on behalf of a candidate.” Vt. Stat.\nAnn., Tit. 17, §2801(2) (2002). Cf. 2 U. S. C. §431(8)(B)(i)\n(2000 ed. and Supp. III) (similar exemption in federal\ncampaign finance statute). But the Act does not exclude\nthe expenses those volunteers incur, such as travel ex\npenses, in the course of campaign activities. The Act’s\nbroad definitions would seem to count those expenses\nagainst the volunteer’s contribution limit, at least where\nthe spending was facilitated or approved by campaign\nofficials.    Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17, §2801(3) (2002)\n(“[E]xpenditure” includes “anything of value, paid . . . for\nthe purpose of influencing an election”); §§2809(a), (c) (Any\n“expenditure . . . intentionally facilitated by, solicited by or\napproved by the candidate” counts as a “contribution”).\nAnd, unlike the Federal Government’s treatment of com\nparable requirements, the State has not (insofar as we are\n26                 RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\naware) created an exception excluding such expenses. Cf.\n2 U. S. C. §§431(8)(B)(iv), (ix) (2000 ed. and Supp. III)\n(excluding from the definition of “contribution” volunteer\ntravel expenses up to $1,000 and payment by political\nparty for campaign materials used in connection with\nvolunteer activities).\n   The absence of some such exception may matter in the\npresent context, where contribution limits are very low.\nThat combination, low limits and no exceptions, means\nthat a gubernatorial campaign volunteer who makes four\nor five round trips driving across the State performing\nvolunteer activities coordinated with the campaign can\nfind that he or she is near, or has surpassed, the contribu\ntion limit. So too will a volunteer who offers a campaign\nthe use of her house along with coffee and doughnuts for a\nfew dozen neighbors to meet the candidate, say, two or\nthree times during a campaign. Cf. Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17,\n§2809(d) (2002) (excluding expenditures for such activities\nonly up to $100). Such supporters will have to keep care\nful track of all miles driven, postage supplied (500 stamps\nequals $200), pencils and pads used, and so forth. And\nany carelessness in this respect can prove costly, perhaps\ngenerating a headline, “Campaign laws violated,” that\nworks serious harm to the candidate.\n   These sorts of problems are unlikely to affect the consti\ntutionality of a limit that is reasonably high. Cf. Buckley,\n424 U. S., at 36–37 (Coordinated expenditure by a volun\nteer “provides material financial assistance to a candi\ndate,” and therefore “may properly be viewed as a contri\nbution”). But Act 64’s contribution limits are so low, and\nits definition of “contribution” so broad, that the Act may\nwell impede a campaign’s ability effectively to use volun\nteers, thereby making it more difficult for individuals to\nassociate in this way. Cf. id., at 22 (Federal contribution\nlimits “leave the contributor free to become a member of\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           27\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nany political association and to assist personally in the\nassociation’s efforts on behalf of candidates”). Again, the\nvery low limits at issue help to transform differences in\ndegree into difference in kind. And the likelihood of un\njustified interference in the present context is sufficiently\ngreat that we must consider the lack of tailoring in the\nAct’s definition of “contribution” as an added factor count\ning against the constitutional validity of the contribution\nlimits before us.\n   Fourth, unlike the contribution limits we upheld in\nShrink, see supra, at 16, Act 64’s contribution limits are\nnot adjusted for inflation. Its limits decline in real value\neach year. Indeed, in real dollars the Act’s limits have\nalready declined by about 20% ($200 in 2006 dollars has a\nreal value of $160.66 in 1997 dollars). A failure to index\nlimits means that limits which are already suspiciously\nlow, see supra, at 14–17, will almost inevitably become too\nlow over time. It means that future legislation will be\nnecessary to stop that almost inevitable decline, and it\nthereby imposes the burden of preventing the decline upon\nincumbent legislators who may not diligently police the\nneed for changes in limit levels to assure the adequate\nfinancing of electoral challenges.\n   Fifth, we have found nowhere in the record any special\njustification that might warrant a contribution limit so\nlow or so restrictive as to bring about the serious associa\ntional and expressive problems that we have described.\nRather, the basic justifications the State has advanced in\nsupport of such limits are those present in Buckley. The\nrecord contains no indication that, for example, corruption\n(or its appearance) in Vermont is significantly more seri\nous a matter than elsewhere. Indeed, other things being\nequal, one might reasonably believe that a contribution of\nsay, $250 (or $450) to a candidate’s campaign was less\nlikely to prove a corruptive force than the far larger con\n28                  RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ntributions at issue in the other campaign finance cases we\nhave considered. See supra, at 15–17.\n   These five sets of considerations, taken together, lead us\nto conclude that Act 64’s contribution limits are not nar\nrowly tailored. Rather, the Act burdens First Amendment\ninterests by threatening to inhibit effective advocacy by\nthose who seek election, particularly challengers; its con\ntribution limits mute the voice of political parties; they\nhamper participation in campaigns through volunteer\nactivities; and they are not indexed for inflation. Vermont\ndoes not point to a legitimate statutory objective that\nmight justify these special burdens. We understand that\nmany, though not all, campaign finance regulations im\npose certain of these burdens to some degree. We also\nunderstand the legitimate need for constitutional leeway\nin respect to legislative line-drawing. But our discussion\nindicates why we conclude that Act 64 in this respect\nnonetheless goes too far. It disproportionately burdens\nnumerous First Amendment interests, and consequently,\nin our view, violates the First Amendment.\n   We add that we do not believe it possible to sever some\nof the Act’s contribution limit provisions from others that\nmight remain fully operative. See Champlin Refining Co.\nv. Corporation Comm’n of Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234 (1932)\n(“invalid part may be dropped if what is left is fully opera\ntive as a law”); see also Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of\nChippewa Indians, 526 U. S. 172, 191 (1999) (severability\n“essentially an inquiry into legislative intent”); Vt. Stat.\nAnn., Tit. 1, §215 (2003) (severability principles apply to\nVermont statutes). To sever provisions to avoid constitu\ntional objection here would require us to write words into\nthe statute (inflation indexing), or to leave gaping loop\nholes (no limits on party contributions), or to foresee which\nof many different possible ways the legislature might\nrespond to the constitutional objections we have found.\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           29\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nGiven these difficulties, we believe the Vermont Legisla\nture would have intended us to set aside the statute’s\ncontribution limits, leaving the legislature free to rewrite\nthose provisions in light of the constitutional difficulties\nwe have identified.\n                             IV\n   We conclude that Act 64’s expenditure limits violate the\nFirst Amendment as interpreted in Buckley v. Valeo. We\nalso conclude that the specific details of Act 64’s contribu\ntion limits require us to hold that those limits violate the\nFirst Amendment, for they burden First Amendment\ninterests in a manner that is disproportionate to the pub\nlic purposes they were enacted to advance. Given our\nholding, we need not, and do not, examine the constitu\ntionality of the statute’s presumption that certain party\nexpenditures are coordinated with a candidate. Vt. Stat.\nAnn., Tit. 17, §2809(d) (2002). Accordingly, the judgment\nof the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cases are\nremanded for further proceedings.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

Contrary to\nthe suggestion of those sections, respondents’ primary\ndefense of Vermont’s expenditure limits is that those\nlimits are consistent with Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.

See Sorrell Brief 31.\nSuch an incomplete presentation is reason enough to refuse\nrespondents’ invitation to reexamine Buckley. See United\nStates v. International Business Machines Corp., 517 U.

I agree that both limitations violate the First\nAmendment.\n   As the plurality notes, our cases hold that expenditure\nlimitations “place substantial and direct restrictions on\nthe ability of candidates, citizens, and associations to\nengage in protected political expression, restrictions that\nthe First Amendment cannot tolerate.” Buckley v. Valeo,\n424 U. S. 1, 58–59 (1976) (per curiam); see also Colorado\nRepublican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election\nComm’n, 518 U.

The exacting scrutiny the\nplurality applies to expenditure limitations, however, is\nappropriate. For the reasons explained in the plurality\nopinion, respondents’ attempts to distinguish the present\nlimitations from those we have invalidated are unavailing.\nThe Court has upheld contribution limits that do “not\ncome even close to passing any serious scrutiny.” Nixon v.\nShrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 410\n(2000) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Those concerns aside,\nVermont’s contributions, as the plurality’s detailed analy\nsis indicates, are even more stifling than the ones that\nsurvived Shrink’s unduly lenient review.\n  The universe of campaign finance regulation is one this\nCourt has in part created and in part permitted by its\ncourse of decisions. That new order may cause more prob\nlems than it solves. On a routine, operational level the\npresent system requires us to explain why $200 is too\nrestrictive a limit while $1,500 is not. Our own experience\ngives us little basis to make these judgments, and cer\ntainly no traditional or well-established body of law exists\nto offer guidance. On a broader, systemic level political\nparties have been denied basic First Amendment rights.\nSee, e.g., McConnell v. Federal Election Comm’n, 540 U. S.\n93, 286–287, 313 (2003) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judg\nment in part and dissenting in part). Entering to fill the\nvoid have been new entities such as political action com\nmittees, which are as much the creatures of law as of\ntraditional forces of speech and association. Those entities\ncan manipulate the system and attract their own elite\npower brokers, who operate in ways obscure to the ordi\nnary citizen.\n  Viewed within the legal universe we have ratified and\nhelped create, the result the plurality reaches is correct;\n                Cite as: 548 U.

Stat. Ann.,\nTit. 17, §2801 et seq. (2002) (Act 64), is unconstitutional, I\ndisagree with its rationale for striking down that statute.\nInvoking stare decisis, the plurality rejects the invitation\nto overrule Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per cu\nriam).1 It then applies Buckley to invalidate the expendi\n——————\n   1 Although the plurality’s stare decisis analysis is limited to Buckley’s\n\ntreatment of expenditure limitations, its reasoning cannot be so con\nfined, and would apply equally to Buckley’s standard for evaluating\ncontribution limits. See ante, at 10 (noting, inter alia, that Buckley has\nengendered “considerable reliance” that would be “dramatically under\nmine[d]” by overruling it now).\n2                   RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nture limitations and, less persuasively, the contribution\nlimitations. I continue to believe that Buckley provides\ninsufficient protection to political speech, the core of the\nFirst Amendment. The illegitimacy of Buckley is further\nunderscored by the continuing inability of the Court (and\nthe plurality here) to apply Buckley in a coherent and\nprincipled fashion. As a result, stare decisis should pose\nno bar to overruling Buckley and replacing it with a stan\ndard faithful to the First Amendment. Accordingly, I\nconcur only in the judgment.\n                               I\n   I adhere to my view that this Court erred in Buckley\nwhen it distinguished between contribution and expendi\nture limits, finding the former to be a less severe in\nfringement on First Amendment rights. See Nixon v.\nShrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 410–418\n(2000) (dissenting opinion) (Shrink); Federal Election\nComm’n v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign\nComm., 533 U. S. 431, 465–466 (2001) (Colorado II) (dis\nsenting opinion); Colorado Republican Federal Campaign\nComm. v. Federal Election Comm’n, 518 U. S. 604, 635–\n644 (1996) (Colorado I) (opinion concurring in judgment\nand dissenting in part). “[U]nlike the Buckley Court, I\nbelieve that contribution limits infringe as directly and as\nseriously upon freedom of political expression and associa\ntion as do expenditure limits.” Id., at 640. The Buckley\nCourt distinguished contributions from expenditures\nbased on the presence of an intermediary between a con\ntributor and the speech eventually produced. But that\nreliance is misguided, given that “[e]ven in the case of a\ndirect expenditure, there is usually some go-between that\nfacilitates the dissemination of the spender’s message.”\nColorado I, supra, at 638–639; Shrink, supra, at 413–418\n(Thomas, J., dissenting). Likewise, Buckley’s suggestion\nthat contribution caps only marginally restrict speech,\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            3\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nbecause “[a] contribution serves as a general expression of\nsupport for the candidate and his views, but does not\ncommunicate the underlying basis for the support,” 424\nU. S., at 21, even if descriptively accurate, does not sup\nport restrictions on contributions. After all, statements of\ngeneral support are as deserving of constitutional protec\ntion as those that communicate specific reasons for that\nsupport. Colorado I, supra, at 639–640 (opinion of Tho\nmas, J.); Shrink, supra, at 414–415, and n. 3 (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting). Accordingly, I would overrule Buckley and\nsubject both the contribution and expenditure restrictions\nof Act 64 to strict scrutiny, which they would fail. See\nColorado I, supra, at 640–641 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (“I\nam convinced that under traditional strict scrutiny, broad\nprophylactic caps on both spending and giving in the\npolitical process . . . are unconstitutional”). See also Colo\nrado II, supra, at 465–466 (Thomas, J., dissenting).\n                              II\n   The plurality opinion, far from making the case for\nBuckley as a rule of law, itself demonstrates that Buckley’s\nlimited scrutiny of contribution limits is “insusceptible of\nprincipled application,” and accordingly is not entitled to\nstare decisis effect. See BMW of North America, Inc. v.\nGore, 517 U. S. 559, 599 (1996) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\nIndeed, “ ‘when governing decisions are unworkable or are\nbadly reasoned, this Court has never felt constrained to\nfollow precedent.’ ” Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, 306\n(2004) (plurality opinion) (quoting Payne v. Tennessee, 501\nU. S. 808, 827 (1991); internal quotation marks omitted).\nToday’s newly minted, multifactor test, particularly when\nread in combination with the Court’s decision in Shrink,\nsupra, places this Court in the position of addressing the\npropriety of regulations of political speech based upon\nlittle more than its impression of the appropriate limits.\n   The plurality sets forth what appears to be a two-step\n4                   RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nprocess for evaluating the validity of contribution limits:\nFirst, determine whether there are “danger signs” in a\nparticular case that the limits are too low; and, second,\nuse “independent judicial judgment” to “review the record\nindependently and carefully with an eye towards assessing\nthe statute’s ‘tailoring,’ that is, towards assessing the\nproportionality of the restrictions.” Ante, at 14. Neither\nstep of this test can be reduced to a workable inquiry to be\nperformed by States attempting to comply with this\nCourt’s jurisprudence.\n    As to the first step, it is entirely unclear how to deter\nmine whether limits are so low as to constitute “danger\nsigns” that require a court to “examine the record inde\npendently and carefully.” Ante, at 18. The plurality\npoints to several aspects of the Act that support its conclu\nsion that such signs are present here: (1) the limits are set\nper election cycle, rather than divided between primary\nand general elections; (2) the limits apply to contributions\nfrom political parties; (3) the limits are the lowest in the\nNation; and (4) the limits are below those we have previ\nously upheld. Ante, at 15–19.\n    The first two elements of the Act are indeed constitu\ntionally problematic, but they have no bearing on whether\nthe contribution limits are too low. The first substantially\nadvantages candidates in a general election who did not\nface a serious primary challenge. In practice, this restric\ntion will generally suppress more speech by challengers\nthan by incumbents, without serving the interests the\nCourt has recognized as compelling, i.e., the prevention of\ncorruption or the appearance thereof. Cf. B. Smith, Un\nfree Speech: The Folly of Campaign Finance Reform 50–51\n(2001) (hereinafter Smith) (describing the ability of in\ncumbents to amass money early, discouraging serious\nchallengers from entering a race). The second element has\nno relation to these compelling interests either, given that\n“ ‘[t]he very aim of a political party is to influence its can\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            5\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndidate’s stance on issues and, if the candidate takes office\nor is reelected, his votes.’ ” Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 476\n(Thomas, J., dissenting) (citing Colorado I, 518 U. S., at\n646 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in\npart)). That these provisions are unconstitutional, how\never, does not make the contribution limits on individuals\nunconstitutionally low.\n   We are left, then, with two reasons to scrutinize Act 64’s\nlimitations: They are lower than those of other States, and\nlower than those we have upheld in previous cases, i.e.,\nBuckley and Shrink. But the relative limits of other\nStates cannot be the key factor, for such considerations\nare nothing more than a moving target. After all, if the\nVermont Legislature simply persuaded several other\nStates to lower their contribution limits to parallel Act 64,\nthen the Act, which would still “significantly restrict the\namount of funding available for challengers to run com\npetitive campaigns,” ante, at 19, would survive this aspect\nof the majority’s proposed test.\n   Nor is the relationship of these limits to those in Buck\nley and Shrink a critical fact. In Shrink, the Court specifi\ncally determined that Buckley did not “set a minimum\nconstitutional threshold for contribution limits,” rejecting\nsuch a contention as a “fundamental misunderstanding of\nwhat we held.” 528 U. S., at 396. The plurality’s current\ntreatment of the limits in Shrink as a constitutional\nminimum, or at least as limits below which “danger signs”\nare present, thus cannot be reconciled with Shrink itself.\n   Having nevertheless concluded that these “danger\nsigns” require us to scrutinize the record, the plurality\nembarks on an odd review of the contribution limits, com\nbining unrelated factors to determine that, “taken to\ngether,” ante, at 19, the restrictions of Act 64 are not\nclosely drawn to meet their objectives. Two of these fac\ntors simply cause the already stringent limitations on\nindividual contributions to be more stringent; i.e., volun\n6                        RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nteer services count toward the contribution limit, ante, at\n25–27, and the limits do not change with inflation, so they\nwill become even more stringent in time, ante, at 27.2\nWhile these characteristics confirm the plurality’s impres\nsion that these limits are, indeed, quite low, they have\nnothing whatsoever to do with whether the restrictions\nare closely drawn to meet their objectives. The plurality\nwould presumably uphold a limit on contributions of $1\nmillion, even if volunteer services counted toward that\nlimit and the limit did not change with inflation. Charac\nterizing these facts as shifting Act 64’s limits from “suspi\nciously low” to “too low,” ibid., provides no insight on how\nto draw this constitutional line.\n   The plurality next departs from the general applicability\nof the contribution limits entirely, and notes the substan\ntial interference of the contribution limits with the activi\nties of parties. Again, I do not dispute that the limitation\non party contributions is unconstitutional; as I have previ\nously noted, such limitations are unconstitutional even\nunder Buckley. See Colorado II, supra, at 476–477. But it\nis entirely unclear why the mere fact that the “suspi\nciously low” contribution limits also apply to parties\nshould mean that those limits are in fact “too low” when\nthey are applied to individuals. If the limits impermissi\nbly intrude upon the associational rights of parties, then\nthe limits are unconstitutional as applied to parties. But\n——————\n    2 Ironically,\n               the plurality is troubled by the fact that the absence of a\nprovision adjusting the limits for inflation means that the real value of\nthe limits will decline, and that “the burden of preventing the decline\n[lies] upon incumbent legislators who may not diligently police the need\nfor changes in limit levels to assure the adequate financing of electoral\nchallenges.” Ante, at 27. It is impossible to square this wariness of\nincumbents’ disinclination to enact future laws protecting challengers\nwith the plurality’s deference to those same incumbents when they\nmake empirical judgments regarding “the precise restriction necessary\nto carry out the statute’s legitimate objectives” in the first place. Ante,\nat 14.\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

First, the\nlimits affect a substantial portion of the money given to\nchallengers. But contribution limits always dispropor\ntionately burden challengers, who often have smaller\nbases of support than incumbents. See Smith, 66–70. In\nShrink, the Court expressly rejected the argument that a\nnegative impact on a challenger could render a contribu\ntion limit invalid, relying on the same sort of analysis of\nthe “average effect of contribution limits on fundraising,”\nante, at 21, that the plurality today rejects. See 528 U. S.,\nat 396 (noting that 97.62% of all contributors for state\nauditor made contributions of less than $2,000, and that\n“[e]ven if we were to assume that the contribution limits\naffected respondent[’s] ability to wage a competitive cam\npaign . . . a showing of one affected individual does not\npoint up a system of suppressed political advocacy “that\n——————\n    3 The plurality’s connection of these two factors implies that it is con\n\ncerned not with the impact on the speech of contributors, but solely\nwith the speech of candidates, for whom the two facts might be con\nnected. See ante, at 19. Indeed, the plurality notably omits interference\nwith participation in campaigns through monetary contributions from\nthe list of reasons the Act is unconstitutional. See id., at 19, 27. But\ncontributors, too, have a right to free speech. See Colorado I 518 U. S.\n604, 637 (1996) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in\npart) (“If an individual is limited in the amount of resources he can\ncontribute to the pool, he is most certainly limited in his ability to\nassociate for purposes of effective advocacy”). Even Buckley v. Valeo,\n424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per curiam), recognizes that contribution limits\nrestrict the free speech of contributors, even if it understates the\nsignificance of this restriction. See id., at 20–21 (“[A] limitation upon\nthe amount that any one person or group may contribute to a candidate\n. . . entails only a marginal restriction upon the contributor’s ability to\nengage in free communication”).\n8                   RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nwould be unconstitutional under Buckley”). Cf. id., at 420\n(Thomas, J., dissenting) (“The Court in Buckley provided\nno basis for suppressing the speech of an individual candi\ndate simply because other candidates (or candidates in the\naggregate) may succeed in reaching the voting public . . .\nany such reasoning would fly in the face of the premise of\nour political system—liberty vested in individual hands\nsafeguards the functioning of our democracy”). An indi\nvidual’s First Amendment right is infringed whether his\nspeech is decreased by 5% or 95%, and whether he suffers\nalone or shares his violation with his fellow citizens.\nCertainly, the First Amendment does not authorize us to\njudge whether a restriction of political speech imposes a\nsufficiently severe disadvantage on challengers that a\ncandidate should be able to complain. See Shrink, supra,\nat 427 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (“[C]ourts have no yard\nstick by which to judge the proper amount and effective\nness of campaign speech”).\n   The plurality’s final justification fares no better. Argu\ning that Vermont offers no justification for imposing a\nlimit lower than that imposed in any other State is simply\nanother way of saying that the benchmark for whether a\ncontribution limitation is constitutional is what other\nStates have imposed. As I have noted above, supra, at 6,\ntying individuals’ First Amendment rights to the presence\nor absence of similar laws in other States is inconsistent\nwith the First Amendment.\n   The plurality recognizes that the burdens which lead it\nto invalidate Act 64’s contribution limits are present under\n“many, though not all, campaign finance regulations.”\nAnte, at 28. As a result, the plurality does not purport to\noffer any single touchstone for evaluating the constitu\ntionality of such laws. Indeed, its discussion offers noth\ning resembling a rule at all. From all appearances, the\nplurality simply looked at these limits and said, in its\n“independent judicial judgment,” ante, at 14, that they are\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)             9\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntoo low. The atmospherics—whether they vary with infla\ntion, whether they are as high as those in other States or\nthose in Shrink and Buckley, whether they apply to volun\nteer activities and parties—no doubt help contribute to the\nplurality’s sentiment. But a feeling does not amount to a\nworkable rule of law.\n   This is not to say that the plurality errs in concluding\nthat these limits are too low to satisfy even Buckley’s\nlenient standard. Indeed, it is almost impossible to imag\nine that any legislator would ever find his scruples over\ncome by a $201 donation. See Shrink, supra, at 425\n(Thomas, J., dissenting) (“I cannot fathom how a $251\ncontribution could pose a substantial risk of ‘secur[ing] a\npolitical quid pro quo’ ” (quoting Buckley, 424 U. S., at 26)).\nAnd the statistics relied on by the plurality indeed reveal\nthat substantial resources will be lost by candidates run\nning campaigns under these limits. See ante, at 19–22.\nGiven that these contribution limits severely impinge on\nthe ability of candidates to run campaigns and on the\nability of citizens to contribute to campaigns, and do so\nwithout any demonstrable need to avoid corruption, they\ncannot possibly satisfy even Buckley’s ambiguous level of\nscrutiny.\n   But the plurality’s determination that this statute\nclearly lies on the impermissible side of the constitutional\nline gives no assistance in drawing this line, and it is clear\nthat no such line can be drawn rationally. There is simply\nno way to calculate just how much money a person would\nneed to receive before he would be corrupt or perceived to\nbe corrupt (and such a calculation would undoubtedly vary\nby person). Likewise, there is no meaningful way of dis\ncerning just how many resources must be lost before\nspeech is “disproportionately burden[ed].” Ante, at 28.\nBuckley, as the plurality has applied it, gives us license to\nsimply strike down any limits that just seem to be too\nstringent, and to uphold the rest.

Valeo, 424 U. S. 1\n(1976), forecloses any constitutional limitations on candi\ndate expenditures. This is plainly an issue on which\nreasonable minds can disagree. The Buckley Court never\nexplicitly addressed whether the pernicious effects of\nendless fundraising can serve as a compelling state inter\nest that justifies expenditure limits, post, at 2 (SOUTER, J.,\ndissenting), yet its silence, in light of the record before it,\nsuggests that it implicitly treated this proposed interest\ninsufficient, ante, at 11 (plurality opinion of BREYER, J.).\nAssuming this to be true, however, I am convinced that\nBuckley’s holding on expenditure limits is wrong, and that\n2                   RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthe time has come to overrule it.\n    I have not reached this conclusion lightly. As JUSTICE\nBREYER correctly observes, stare decisis is a principle of\n“ ‘fundamental importance.’ ” Ante, at 9. But it is not an\ninexorable command, and several factors, taken together,\nprovide special justification for revisiting the constitution\nality of statutory limits on candidate expenditures.\n    To begin with, Buckley’s holding on expenditure limits\nitself upset a long-established practice. For the preceding\n65 years, congressional races had been subject to statutory\nlimits on both expenditures and contributions. See 37\nStat. 28; Federal Corrupt Practices Act of 1925, 43 Stat.\n1073; Federal Election Campaign Finance Act of 1971, 86\nStat. 5; Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of\n1974, 88 Stat. 1263; United States v. Automobile Workers,\n352 U. S. 567, 575–576 (1957); McConnell v. Federal Elec\ntion Comm’n, 540 U. S. 93, 115–117 (2003). As the Court of\nAppeals had recognized in Buckley v. Valeo, 519 F. 2d 821,\n859 (CADC 1975) (en banc) (per curiam), our earlier juris\nprudence provided solid support for treating these limits as\npermissible regulations of conduct rather than speech. Ibid.\n(discussing Burroughs v. United States, 290 U. S. 534\n(1934), and United States v. Harriss, 347 U. S. 612 (1954));\nsee also 519 F. 2d, at 841, and n. 41, 851, and n. 68. While\nBuckley’s holding on contribution limits was consistent with\nthis backdrop, its holding on expenditure limits “involve[d]\ncollision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope,\nintrinsically sounder, and verified by experience,” Helvering\nv. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 (1940).\n    There are further reasons for reexamining Buckley’s\nholding on candidate expenditure limits that do not apply\nto its holding on candidate contribution limits. Although\nwe have subsequently reiterated the line Buckley drew\nbetween these two types of limits, we have done so primar\nily in cases affirming the validity of contribution limits or\ntheir functional equivalents. See McConnell, 540 U. S., at\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                     3\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n134–138; Federal Election Comm’n v. Colorado Republican\nFederal Campaign Comm., 533 U. S. 431, 440–442 (2001);\nNixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377,\n386–387 (2000); cf. California Medical Assn. v. Federal\nElection Comm’n, 453 U. S. 182, 194–195 (1981) (plurality\nopinion). In contrast, these are our first post-Buckley cases\nthat raise the constitutionality of expenditure limits on the\namounts that candidates for office may spend on their own\ncampaigns.1\n   Accordingly, while we have explicitly recognized the\nimportance of stare decisis in the context of Buckley’s\nholding on contribution limits, McConnell, 540 U. S., at\n137–138, we have never before done so with regard to its\nrejection of expenditure limits. And McConnell’s recogni\ntion rested largely on an interest specific to Buckley’s\nholding on contribution limits. There, we stated that\n“[c]onsiderations of stare decisis, buttressed by the respect\nthat the Legislative and Judicial Branches owe to one\nanother, provide additional powerful reasons for adhering\nto the analysis of contribution limits that the Court has\nconsistently followed since Buckley was decided.” 540\nU. S., at 137–138 (emphasis added). This powerful but\ntress is absent from Buckley’s refusal to defer to the Legis\nlature’s judgment as to the importance of expenditure\nlimits. Relatedly, while Congress and state legislatures\nhave long relied on Buckley’s authorization of contribution\nlimits, Buckley’s rejection of expenditure limits “has not\ninduced [comparable] detrimental reliance,” Lawrence v.\n——————\n  1 We have, of course, invalidated limits on independent expenditures by\nthird persons. Federal Election Comm’n v. National Conservative Political\nAction Comm., 470 U. S. 480 (1985); Colorado Republican Federal Cam\npaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm’n, 518 U. S. 604 (1996); cf. Federal\nElection Comm’n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238\n(1986). In these cases the principal parties accepted Buckley’s holding on\ncandidate expenditure limits and gave us no cause to consider how much\nweight to give stare decisis.\n4                   RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nTexas, 539 U. S. 558, 577 (2003). See also Vieth v. Jube\nlirer, 541 U. S. 267, 306 (2004) (plurality opinion) (noting\nlessened stare decisis concern where “it is hard to imagine\nhow any action taken in reliance upon [the prior case]\ncould conceivably be frustrated”).\n   Perhaps in partial recognition of these points, Justice\nWhite refused to abandon his opposition to Buckley’s\nholding on expenditure limits.        See Federal Election\nComm’n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S.\n238, 271 (1986); Federal Election Comm’n v. National\nConservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 507–512\n(1985) (dissenting opinion). He believed Buckley deeply\nwrong on this issue because it confused “the identification of\nspeech with its antecedents.” National Conservative Politi\ncal Action Comm., 470 U. S., at 508. Over the course of his\nsteadfast campaign, he converted at least one other Buck\nley participant to this position, see National Conservative\nPolitical Action Comm., 470 U. S., at 518–521 (Marshall,\nJ., dissenting), and his reasoning has since persuaded\nme—the nonparticipating Member of the Buckley Court—\nas well.\n   As Justice White recognized, it is quite wrong to equate\nmoney and speech. Buckley, 424 U. S., at 263 (opinion\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). To the\ncontrary,\n       “The burden on actual speech imposed by limita\n    tions on the spending of money is minimal and indi\n    rect. All rights of direct political expression and advo\n    cacy are retained. Even under the campaign laws as\n    originally enacted, everyone was free to spend as\n    much as they chose to amplify their views on general\n    political issues, just not specific candidates. The re\n    strictions, to the extent they do affect speech, are\n    viewpoint-neutral and indicate no hostility to the\n    speech itself or its effects.” National Conservative Po\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            5\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n    litical Action Comm., 470 U. S., at 508–509 (White, J.,\n    dissenting).\nAccordingly, these limits on expenditures are far more\nakin to time, place, and manner restrictions than to re\nstrictions on the content of speech. Like Justice White, I\nwould uphold them “so long as the purposes they serve are\nlegitimate and sufficiently substantial.” Buckley, 424\nU. S., at 264.\n  Buckley’s conclusion to the contrary relied on the follow\ning oft-quoted metaphor:\n     “Being free to engage in unlimited political expression\n     subject to a ceiling on expenditures is like being free\n     to drive an automobile as far and as often as one de\n     sires on a single tank of gasoline.” Id., at 19, n. 18.\nBut, of course, while a car cannot run without fuel, a\ncandidate can speak without spending money. And while\na car can only travel so many miles per gallon, there is no\nlimit on the number of speeches or interviews a candidate\nmay give on a limited budget. Moreover, provided that\nthis budget is above a certain threshold, a candidate can\nexercise due care to ensure that her message reaches all\nvoters. Just as a driver need not use a Hummer to reach\nher destination, so a candidate need not flood the airways\nwith ceaseless sound-bites of trivial information in order\nto provide voters with reasons to support her.\n   Indeed, the examples of effective speech in the political\narena that did not depend on any significant expenditure\nby the campaigner are legion. It was the content of Wil\nliam Jennings Bryan’s comments on the “Cross of Gold”—\nand William McKinley’s responses delivered from his front\nporch in Canton, Ohio—rather than any expenditure of\nmoney that appealed to their cost-free audiences. Neither\nAbraham Lincoln nor John F. Kennedy paid for the oppor\ntunity to engage in the debates with Stephen Douglas and\nRichard Nixon that may well have determined the out\n6                      RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncomes of Presidential elections. When the seasoned cam\npaigners who were Members of the Congress that en\ndorsed the expenditure limits in the Federal Election\nCampaign Act Amendments of 1974 concluded that a\nmodest budget would not preclude them from effectively\ncommunicating with the electorate, they necessarily re\njected the Buckley metaphor.\n  These campaigners also identified significant govern\nment interests favoring the imposition of expenditure\nlimits. Not only do these limits serve as an important\ncomplement to corruption-reducing contribution limits, see\nid., at 264 (opinion of White, J.), but they also “protect\nequal access to the political arena, [and] free candidates\nand their staffs from the interminable burden of fundrais\ning.” Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v.\nFederal Election Comm’n, 518 U. S. 604, 649–650 (1996)\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting). These last two interests are\nparticularly acute. When campaign costs are so high that\nonly the rich have the reach to throw their hats into the\nring, we fail “to protect the political process from undue\ninfluence of large aggregations of capital and to promote\nindividual responsibility for democratic government.”\nAutomobile Workers, 352 U. S., at 590. States have recog\nnized this problem,2 but Buckley’s perceived ban on expendi\nture limits severely limits their options in dealing with it.\n  The interest in freeing candidates from the fundraising\nstraitjacket is even more compelling. Without expenditure\nlimits, fundraising devours the time and attention of\npolitical leaders, leaving them too busy to handle their\npublic responsibilities effectively. That fact was well\nrecognized by backers of the legislation reviewed in Buck\nley, by the Court of Appeals judges who voted to uphold\n——————\n  2 See Brief for State of Connecticut et al. as Amici Curiae 16–17 (cit\n\ning Ariz.

Cf. 519\nF. 2d, at 838 (and citations to legislative history contained\ntherein); 424 U. S., at 265 (opinion of White, J.). The\nvalidity of their judgment has surely been confirmed by\nthe mountains of evidence that has been accumulated in\nrecent years concerning the time that elected officials\nspend raising money for future campaigns and the adverse\neffect of fundraising on the performance of their official\nduties.3\n  Additionally, there is no convincing evidence that these\nimportant interests favoring expenditure limits are fronts\nfor incumbency protection. Buckley’s cursory suggestion to\nthe contrary, id., at 56–57, failed to take into account the\nmixed evidence before it on this issue. See 519 F. 2d, at\n861, 862 (detailing how “[t]he material available to the\ncourt looks both ways”). And only by “permit[ting] States\nnationwide to experiment with these critically needed\nreforms,”—as 18 States urge us to do—will we enable\nfurther research on how expenditure limits relate to our\nincumbent reelection rates.

Neither the opinions in\nBuckley nor those that form today’s cacophony pay heed to\nhow the Framers would have viewed candidate expendi\nture limits. This is not an unprincipled approach, as the\nhistorical context is “usually relevant but not necessarily\ndispositive.” Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. ___, ___\n(2006) (slip op., at 1) (STEVENS, J., concurring). This is\nparticularly true of contexts that are so different. At the\ntime of the framing the accepted posture of the leading\ncandidates was one of modesty, acknowledging a willingness\nto serve rather than a desire to compete. Speculation about\nhow the Framers would have legislated if they had foreseen\nthe era of televised sound-bites thus cannot provide us with\ndefinitive answers.\n  Nevertheless, I am firmly persuaded that the Framers\nwould have been appalled by the impact of modern fund-\nraising practices on the ability of elected officials to per\nform their public responsibilities.

The court\nfurther concluded that the “system of unlimited spending has deleteri\nous effects on the competitiveness of elections because it gives incum\nbent candidates an electoral advantage.” Ibid. While far from conclu\nsive, this example cuts against the view that there is a slam-dunk\ncorrelation between expenditure limits and incumbent advantage.

S. 1 (1976) (per curiam),\nante, at 8–11 (opinion of BREYER, J.), is at least premature.\n  We said in Buckley that “expenditure limitations impose\nfar greater restraints on the freedom of speech and asso\nciation than do . . . contribution limitations,” 424 U. S., at\n44, but the Buckley Court did not categorically foreclose\nthe possibility that some spending limit might comport\nwith the First Amendment. Instead, Buckley held that the\nconstitutionality of an expenditure limitation “turns on\nwhether the governmental interests advanced in its sup\nport satisfy the [applicable] exacting scrutiny.” Ibid. In\napplying that standard in Buckley itself, the Court gave no\nindication that it had given serious consideration to an\naim that Vermont’s statute now pursues: to alleviate the\ndrain on candidates’ and officials’ time caused by the\nendless fundraising necessary to aggregate many small\ncontributions to meet the opportunities for ever more\nexpensive campaigning. Instead, we dwelt on rejecting\nthe sufficiency of interests in reducing corruption, equaliz\ning the financial resources of candidates, and capping the\noverall cost of political campaigns, see id., at 55–57. Al\nthough Justice White went a step further in dissenting\nfrom the Court on expenditures, and made something of\nthe interest in getting officials off the “treadmill” driven by\nthe “obsession with fundraising,” see id., at 265 (opinion\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part), this lurking\nissue was not treated as significant on the expenditure\nquestion in the per curiam opinion. Whatever the obser\nvations made to the Buckley Court about the effect of\nfundraising on candidates’ time, the Court did not\nsquarely address a time-protection interest as support for\nthe expenditure limits, much less one buttressed by as\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

Three decades of\nexperience since Buckley have taught us much, and the\nfindings made by the Vermont Legislature on the perni\ncious effect of the nonstop pursuit of money are signifi\ncant.

The District Court was instructed to\nexamine a variety of outstanding issues, including alter\nnatives considered by Vermont’s Legislature and the\nreasons for rejecting them. See id., at 136. Thus, the\nconstitutionality of the expenditure limits was not conclu\nsively decided by the Second Circuit, and I believe the\nevidentiary work that remained to be done would have\nraised the prospect for a sound answer to that question,\nwhatever the answer might have been. Instead, we are\nleft with an unresolved question of narrow tailoring and\nwith consequent doubt about the justifiability of the\nspending limits as necessary and appropriate correctives.\nThis is not the record on which to foreclose the ability of a\nState to remedy the impact of the money chase on the\ndemocratic process. I would not, therefore, disturb the\nCourt of Appeals’s stated intention to remand.\n                               II\n   Although I would defer judgment on the merits of the\nexpenditure limitations, I believe the Court of Appeals\ncorrectly rejected the challenge to the contribution limits.\nLow though they are, one cannot say that “the contribu\ntion limitation[s are] so radical in effect as to render po\nlitical association ineffective, drive the sound of a candi\ndate’s voice below the level of notice, and render\ncontributions pointless.” Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Gov\nernment PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 397 (2000).\n   The limits set by Vermont are not remarkable depar\ntures either from those previously upheld by this Court or\nfrom those lately adopted by other States. The plurality\nconcedes that on a per-citizen measurement Vermont’s\nlimit for statewide elections “is slightly more generous,”\nante, at 18, than the one set by the Missouri statute ap\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

Not only do those\ndollar amounts get more generous the smaller the district,\nthey are consistent with limits set by the legislatures of\nmany other States, all of them with populations larger than\nVermont’s, some significantly so. See, e.g., Montana Right\nto Life Assn. v. Eddleman, 343 F. 3d 1085, 1088 (CA9 2003)\n(approving $400 limit for candidates filed jointly for Gover\nnor and Lieutenant Governor, since increased to $500, see\nMont. Code Ann. §13–37–216(1)(a)(i) (2005)); Daggett v.\nCommission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices,\n205 F. 3d 445, 452 (CA1 2000) ($500 limit for gubernatorial\ncandidates in Maine); Minnesota Citizens Concerned for\nLife, Inc. v.

The point is not that this Court is bound by\njudicial sanctions of those numbers; it is that the consis\ntency in legislative judgment tells us that Vermont is not an\neccentric party of one, and that this is a case for the judicial\ndeference that our own precedents say we owe here. See\nShrink, supra, at 402 (BREYER, J., concurring) (“Where a\nlegislature has significantly greater institutional expertise,\nas, for example, in the field of election regulation, the Court\nin practice defers to empirical legislative judgments”); see\nalso ante, at 14 (plurality opinion) (“[O]rdinarily we have\ndeferred to the legislature’s determination of [matters re\nlated to the costs and nature of running for office]”).\n   To place Vermont’s contribution limits beyond the con\nstitutional pale, therefore, is to forget not only the facts of\nShrink, but also our self-admonition against second-\nguessing legislative judgments about the risk of corruption\nto which contribution limits have to be fitted. See Shrink,\nsupra, at 391, and n. 5. And deference here would surely\nnot be overly complaisant. Vermont’s legislators them\n6                   RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nselves testified at length about the money that gets their\nspecial attention, see Act 64, H. 28, Legislative Findings\nand Intent, at App. 20 (finding that “[s]ome candidates\nand elected officials, particularly when time is limited,\nrespond and give access to contributors who make large\ncontributions in preference to those who make small or no\ncontributions”); 382 F. 3d, at 122 (testimony of Elizabeth\nReady: “If I have only got an hour at night when I get\nhome to return calls, I am much more likely to return [a\ndonor’s] call than I would [a non-donor’s] . . . . [W]hen you\nonly have a few minutes to talk, there are certain people\nthat get access” (alterations in original)). The record\nrevealed the amount of money the public sees as suspi\nciously large, see 118 F. Supp. 2d, at 479–480 (“The limits\nset by the legislature . . . accurately reflect the level of\ncontribution considered suspiciously large by the Vermont\npublic. Testimony suggested that amounts greater than\nthe contribution limits are considered large by the Ver\nmont public”). And testimony identified the amounts high\nenough to pay for effective campaigning in a State where\nthe cost of running tends to be on the low side, see id., at\n471 (“In the context of Vermont politics, $200, $300, and\n$400 donations are clearly large, as the legislature deter\nmined.

The majority of major party candidates for\nstatewide office in the last three election cycles spent less\nthan what the spending limits of Act 64 would allow. . . .\nIn Vermont legislative races, low-cost methods such as\ndoor-to-door campaigning are standard and even expected\nby the voters”).\n   Still, our cases do not say deference should be absolute.\nWe can all imagine dollar limits that would be laughable,\nand per capita comparisons that would be meaningless\nbecause aggregated donations simply could not sustain\neffective campaigns. The plurality thinks that point has\nbeen reached in Vermont, and in particular that the low\ncontribution limits threaten the ability of challengers to\nrun effective races against incumbents. Thus, the plural\nity’s limit of deference is substantially a function of suspi\ncion that political incumbents in the legislature set low\ncontribution limits because their public recognition and\neasy access to free publicity will effectively augment their\nown spending power beyond anything a challenger can\nmuster. The suspicion is, in other words, that incumbents\ncannot be trusted to set fair limits, because facially neu\ntral limits do not in fact give challengers an even break.\nBut this received suspicion is itself a proper subject of\nsuspicion. The petitioners offered, and the plurality in\nvokes, no evidence that the risk of a pro-incumbent advan\ntage has been realized; in fact, the record evidence runs\nthe other way, as the plurality concedes. See ante, at 22\n(“the record does contain some anecdotal evidence support\ning the respondents’ position, namely, testimony about a\npost-Act-64 competitive mayoral campaign in Burlington,\nwhich suggests that a challenger can ‘amas[s] the re\nsources necessary for effective advocacy,’ Buckley, 424\nU. S., at 21”). I would not discount such evidence that\n8                  RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nthese low limits are fair to challengers, for the experience\nof the Burlington race is confirmed by recent empirical\nstudies addressing this issue of incumbent’s advantage.\nSee, e.g., Eom & Gross, Contribution Limits and Disparity\nin Contributions Between Gubernatorial Candidates, 59\nPol. Research Q. 99, 99 (2006) (“Analyses of both the\nnumber of contributors and the dollar amount of contribu\ntions [to gubernatorial candidates] suggest no support for\nan increased bias in favor of incumbents resulting from\nthe presence of campaign contribution limits. If anything,\ncontribution limits can work to reduce the bias that tradi\ntionally works in favor of incumbents. Also, contribution\nlimits do not seem to increase disparities between guber\nnatorial candidates in general” (emphasis deleted)); Bard-\nwell, Money and Challenger Emergence in Gubernatorial\nPrimaries, 55 Pol. Research Q. 653 (2002) (finding that\ncontribution limits favor neither incumbents nor challeng\ners); Hogan, The Costs of Representation in State Legisla\ntures: Explaining Variations in Campaign Spending, 81\nSoc. Sci. Q. 941, 952 (2000) (finding that contribution\nlimits reduce incumbent spending but have no effect on\nchallenger or open-seat candidate spending). The Legisla\nture of Vermont evidently tried to account for the realities\nof campaigning in Vermont, and I see no evidence of con\nstitutional miscalculation sufficient to dispense with\nrespect for its judgments.\n                             III\n  Four issues of detail call for some attention, the first\nbeing the requirement that a volunteer’s expenses count\nagainst the person’s contribution limit. The plurality\ncertainly makes out the case that accounting for these\nexpenses will be a colossal nuisance, but there is no case\nhere that the nuisance will noticeably limit volunteering,\nor that volunteers whose expenses reach the limit cannot\ncontinue with their efforts subject to charging their candi\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)             9\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\ndates for the excess. Granted, if the provisions for contri\nbution limits were teetering on the edge of unconstitution\nality, Act 64’s treatment of volunteers’ expenses might be\nthe finger-flick that gives the fatal push, but it has no\ngreater significance than that.\n   Second, the failure of the Vermont law to index its limits\nfor inflation is even less important. This challenge is to\nthe law as it is, not to a law that may have a different\nimpact after future inflation if the state legislature fails to\nbring it up to economic date.\n   Third, subjecting political parties to the same contribu\ntion limits as individuals does not condemn the Vermont\nscheme. What we said in Federal Election Comm’n v.\nColorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., 533 U. S.\n431, 454–455 (2001), dealing with regulation of coordi\nnated expenditures, goes here, too. The capacity and\ndesire of parties to make large contributions to competi\ntive candidates with uphill fights are shared by rich indi\nviduals, and the risk that large party contributions would\nbe channels to evade individual limits cannot be elimi\nnated. Nor are these reasons to support the party limits\nundercut by claims that the restrictions render parties\nimpotent, for the parties are not precluded from uncoordi\nnated spending to benefit their candidates. That said, I\nacknowledge the suggestions in the petitioners’ briefs that\nsuch restrictions in synergy with other influences weaken\ning party power would justify a wholesale reexamination\nof the situation of party organization today. But whether\nsuch a comprehensive reexamination belongs in courts or\nonly in legislatures is not an issue presented by these\ncases.\n   Finally, there is the issue of Act 64’s presumption of\ncoordinated expenditures on the part of political parties,\nVt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17, §2809(d) (2002). The plurality has\nno occasion to reach it; I do reach it, but find it insignifi\ncant. The Republican Party petitioners complain that the\n10                   RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                      SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nrelated expenditure provision imposes on both the candi\ndate and the party the burden in some circumstances to\nprove that coordination of expenditure did not take place,\nthus threatening to charge against a candidate’s spending\nlimits some party expenditures that are in fact independ\nent, with an ultimate consequence of chilling speech. See\nBrief for Respondent/Cross-Petitioner Vermont Republi\ncan State Committee et al. 45–46. On the contrary, how\never, we can safely take the presumption on the represen\ntation to this Court by the Attorney General of Vermont:\nthe law imposes not a burden of persuasion but merely one\nof production, leaving the presumption easily rebuttable.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 39–41 (representation that the pre\nsumption disappears once credible evidence, such as an\naffidavit, is offered); see also Brief for Respondent/Cross-\nPetitioner William H. Sorrell et al. 48 (the presumption\n“contributes no evidence and disappears when facts ap\npear. In a case covered by the presumption, a political\nparty need only present some evidence that the presumed\nfact is not true and the presumption vanishes. . . . Simple\ntestimony that the expenditure was not coordinated would\nsuffice to defeat the presumption” (citations, internal\nquotation marks, and alterations omitted)). As so under\nstood, the rebuttable presumption clearly imposes no\nonerous burden like the conclusive presumption in Colo\nrado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal\nElection Comm’n, 518 U. S. 604, 619 (1996) (principal opin\nion), or the nearly conclusive one in Riley v. National Fed\neration of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 785–786 (1988).\nRequiring the party in possession of the pertinent facts to\ncome forward with them, as easily as by executing an affi\ndavit, does not rise to the level of a constitutionally offensive\nencumbrance here.

Argued February 28, 2006—Decided June 26, 2006*\nVermont’s Act 64 stringently limits both the amounts that candidates\n  for state office may spend on their campaigns and the amounts that\n  individuals, organizations, and political parties may contribute to\n  those campaigns. Soon after Act 64 became law, the petitioners—\n  individuals who have run for state office, citizens who vote in state\n  elections and contribute to campaigns, and political parties and\n  committees participating in state politics—brought this suit against\n  the respondents, state officials charged with enforcing the Act. The\n  District Court held that Act 64’s expenditure limits violate the First\n  Amendment, see Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, and that the Act’s lim\n  its on political parties’ contributions to candidates were unconstitu\n  tional, but found the other contribution limits constitutional. The\n  Second Circuit held that all of the Act’s contribution limits are consti\n  tutional, ruled that the expenditure limits may be constitutional be\n  cause they are supported by compelling interests in preventing cor\n  ruption or its appearance and in limiting the time state officials must\n  spend raising campaign funds, and remanded for the District Court\n  to determine whether the expenditure limits were narrowly tailored\n  to those interests.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the cases are remanded.\n382 F. 3d 91, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE BREYER, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE ALITO,\n  concluded in Parts I, II–B–3, III, and IV that both of Act 64’s sets of\n\n——————\n   * Together with No. 04–1530, Vermont Republican State Committee\net al. v.

SORRELL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    limitations are inconsistent with the First Amendment. Pp. 6–8, 10–\n    29.\n       1. The expenditure limits violate the First Amendment’s free\n    speech guarantees under Buckley. Pp. 6–8, 10–11.\n          (a) In Buckley, the Court held, inter alia, that the Government’s\n    asserted interest in preventing “corruption and the appearance of\n    corruption,” 424 U. S., at 25, provided sufficient justification for the\n    contribution limitations imposed on campaigns for federal office by\n    the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, id., at 23–38, but that\n    FECA’s expenditure limitations violated the First Amendment, id., at\n    39–59. The Court explained that the difference between the two\n    kinds of limitations is that expenditure limits “impose significantly\n    more severe restrictions on protected freedoms of political expression\n    and association than” do contribution limits. Id., at 23. Contribution\n    limits, though a “marginal restriction,” nevertheless leave the con\n    tributor “fre[e] to discuss candidates and issues.” Id., at 20–21. Ex\n    penditure limits, by contrast, impose “[a] restriction on the amount of\n    money a person or group can spend on political communication,” id.,\n    at 19, and thereby necessarily “reduc[e] the quantity of expression by\n    restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their explora\n    tion, and the size of the audience reached,” ibid. For over 30 years, in\n    considering the constitutionality of a host of campaign finance stat\n    utes, this Court has adhered to Buckley’s constraints, including those\n    on expenditure limits. See, e.g., McConnell v. Federal Election\n    Comm’n, 540 U. S. 93, 134. Pp. 6–8.\n          (b) The respondents argue unpersuasively that Buckley should be\n    distinguished from the present cases on a ground they say Buckley\n    did not consider: that expenditure limits help to protect candidates\n    from spending too much time raising money rather than devoting\n    that time to campaigning among ordinary voters. There is no signifi\n    cant basis for that distinction. Act 64’s expenditure limits are not\n    substantially different from those at issue in Buckley. Nor is Ver\n    mont’s primary justification for imposing its expenditure limits sig\n    nificantly different from Congress’ rationale for the Buckley limits:\n    preventing corruption and its appearance. The respondents say un\n    persuasively that, had the Buckley Court considered the time protec\n    tion rationale for expenditure limits, the Court would have upheld\n    those limits in the FECA. The Buckley Court, however, was aware of\n    the connection between expenditure limits and a reduction in fund-\n    raising time. And, in any event, the connection seems perfectly obvi\n    ous. Under these circumstances, the respondents’ argument amounts\n    to no more than an invitation so to limit Buckley’s holding as effec\n    tively to overrule it. That invitation is declined.

Pp. 11–29.\n      (a) In upholding the $1,000 contribution limit before it, the Buck\nley Court recognized, inter alia, that such limits, unlike expenditure\nlimits, “involv[e] little direct restraint on” the contributor’s speech,\n424 U. S., at 21, and are permissible as long as the government dem\nonstrates that they are “closely drawn” to match a “sufficiently im\nportant interest,” id., at 25. It found that the interest there ad\nvanced, “prevent[ing] corruption” and its “appearance,” was\n“sufficiently important” to justify the contribution limits, id., at 25–\n26, and that those limits were “closely drawn.” Although recognizing\nthat, in determining whether a particular contribution limit was\n“closely drawn,” the amount, or level, of that limit could make a dif\nference, see id., at 21, the Court added that such “distinctions in de\ngree become significant only when they . . . amount to differences in\nkind,” id., at 30. Pointing out that it had “no scalpel to probe,\nwhether, say, a $2,000 ceiling might not serve as well as $1,000,”\nibid., the Court found “no indication” that FECA’s contribution limi\ntations would have “any dramatic adverse effect on the funding of\ncampaigns,” id., at 21. Since Buckley, the Court has consistently up\nheld contribution limits in other statutes, but has recognized that\nsuch limits might sometimes work more harm to protected First\nAmendment interests than their anticorruption objectives could jus\ntify, see, e.g., Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377,\n395–397. Pp. 12–13.\n      (b) Although the Court has “no scalpel to probe,” 424 U. S., at 30,\nwith exactitude whether particular contribution limits are too low\nand normally defers to the legislature in that regard, it must never\ntheless recognize the existence of some lower bound, as Buckley ac\nknowledges. While the interests served by contribution limits, pre\nventing corruption and its appearance, “directly implicate the\nintegrity of our electoral process,” McConnell, supra, at 136, that does\nnot simply mean the lower the limit, the better. Contribution limits\nthat are too low also can harm the electoral process by preventing\nchallengers from mounting effective campaigns against incumbent of\nficeholders, thereby reducing democratic accountability. Where there\nis strong indication in a particular case, i.e., danger signs, that such\nrisks exist (both present in kind and likely serious in degree), courts,\nincluding appellate courts, must review the record independently and\ncarefully with an eye toward assessing the statute’s “tailoring,” i.e.,\ntoward assessing the restrictions’ proportionality. See Bose Corp. v.\nConsumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 499. Danger\nsigns that Act 64’s contribution limits may fall outside tolerable First\n4                         RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    Amendment limits are present here. They are substantially lower\n    than both the limits the Court has previously upheld and the compa\n    rable limits in force in other States. Consequently, the record must\n    be examined to determine whether Act 64’s contribution limits are\n    “closely drawn” to match the State’s interests. Pp. 13–19.\n         (c) The record demonstrates that, from a constitutional perspec\n    tive, Act 64’s contribution limits are too restrictive. Five sets of fac\n    tors, taken together, lead to the conclusion that those limits are not\n    narrowly tailored. First, the record suggests, though it does not con\n    clusively prove, that Act 64’s contribution limits will significantly re\n    strict the amount of funding available for challengers to run competi\n    tive campaigns. Second, Act 64’s insistence that a political party and\n    all of its affiliates together abide by exactly the same low $200 to\n    $400 contribution limits that apply to individual contributors threat\n    ens harm to a particularly important political right, the right to asso\n    ciate in a political party. See, e.g., California Democratic Party v.\n    Jones, 530 U. S. 567, 574. Although the Court upheld federal limits\n    on political parties’ contributions to candidates in Federal Election\n    Comm’n v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., 533 U. S.\n    431, the limits there at issue were far less problematic, for they were\n    significantly higher than Act 64’s limits, see, e.g., id., at 438–439, and\n    n. 3, and they were much higher than the federal limits on contribu\n    tions from individuals to candidates, see id., at 453. Third, Act 64’s\n    treatment of volunteer services aggravates the problem. Although\n    the Act excludes uncompensated volunteer services from its “contri\n    bution” definition, it does not exclude the expenses volunteers incur,\n    e.g., travel expenses, in the course of campaign activities. The com\n    bination of very low contribution limits and the absence of an excep\n    tion excluding volunteer expenses may well impede a campaign’s\n    ability effectively to use volunteers, thereby making it more difficult\n    for individuals to associate in this way. Cf. Buckley, supra, at 22.\n    Fourth, unlike the contribution limits upheld in Shrink, Act 64’s lim\n    its are not adjusted for inflation, but decline in real value each year.\n    A failure to index limits means that limits already suspiciously low\n    will almost inevitably become too low over time. Fifth, nowhere in\n    the record is there any special justification for Act 64’s low and re\n    strictive contribution limits. Rather, the basic justifications the State\n    has advanced in support of such limits are those present in Buckley.\n    Indeed, other things being equal, one might reasonably believe that a\n    contribution of, say, $250 (or $450) to a candidate’s campaign was\n    less likely to prove a corruptive force than the far larger contribu\n    tions at issue in the other campaign finance cases the Court has con\n    sidered.

Doing so\nwould require the Court to write words into the statute (inflation in\ndexing), to leave gaping loopholes (no limits on party contributions),\nor to foresee which of many different possible ways the Vermont Leg\nislature might respond to the constitutional objections to Act 64. In\nthese circumstances, the legislature likely would not have intended\nthe Court to set aside the statute’s contribution limits. The legisla\nture is free to rewrite those provisions to address the constitutional\ndifficulties here identified. Pp. 28–29.\n   JUSTICE BREYER, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE in Parts II–B–1 and\nII–B–2, rejected the respondents’ argument that Buckley should, in\neffect, be overruled because subsequent experience has shown that\ncontribution limits alone cannot effectively deter corruption or its ap\npearance. Stare decisis, the basic legal principle commanding judicial\nrespect for a court’s earlier decisions and their rules of law, prevents\nthe overruling of Buckley. Adherence to precedent is the norm; de\nparture from it is exceptional, requiring “special justification,” Ari\nzona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212, especially where, as here, the\nprinciple at issue has become settled through iteration and reitera\ntion over a long period. There is no special justification here. Subse\nquent case law has not made Buckley a legal anomaly or otherwise\nundermined its basic legal principles. Cf. Dickerson v. United States,\n530 U. S. 428, 443. Nor is there any demonstration that circum\nstances have changed so radically as to undermine Buckley’s critical\nfactual assumptions. The respondents have not shown, for example,\nany dramatic increase in corruption or its appearance in Vermont;\nnor have they shown that expenditure limits are the only way to at\ntack that problem. Cf. McConnell, supra. Finally, overruling Buckley\nnow would dramatically undermine the considerable reliance that\nCongress and state legislatures have placed upon it in drafting cam\npaign finance laws. And this Court has followed Buckley, upholding\nand applying its reasoning in later cases. Pp. 8–10.\n   JUSTICE ALITO agreed that Act 64’s expenditure and contribution\nlimits violate the First Amendment, but concluded that respondents’\nbackup argument asking this Court to revisit Buckley v. Valeo, 424\nU. S. 1, need not be reached because they have failed to address consid\nerations of stare decisis. Pp. 1–2.\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY agreed that Vermont’s limitations on campaign\nexpenditures and contributions violate the First Amendment, but\nconcluded that, given his skepticism regarding this Court’s campaign\nfinance jurisprudence, see, e.g., McConnell v. Federal Election\nComm’n, 540 U. S. 93, 286–287, 313, it is appropriate for him to con\ncur only in the judgment. Pp. 1–3.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, agreed that Vermont’s\n6                         RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Act 64 is unconstitutional, but disagreed with the plurality’s ration\n    ale for striking down that statute. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, pro\n    vides insufficient protection to political speech, the core of the First\n    Amendment, is therefore illegitimate and not protected by stare de\n    cisis, and should be overruled and replaced with a standard faithful\n    to the Amendment. This Court erred in Buckley when it distin\n    guished between contribution and expenditure limits, finding the\n    former to be a less severe infringement on First Amendment rights.\n    See, e.g., Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377,\n    410–418. Both the contribution and expenditure restrictions of Act\n    64 should be subjected to strict scrutiny, which they would fail.

Vt.\nStat. Ann., Tit. 17, §2801 et seq. (2002). We hold that both\n2                   RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nsets of limitations are inconsistent with the First Amend\nment. Well-established precedent makes clear that the\nexpenditure limits violate the First Amendment. Buckley\nv. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 54–58 (1976) (per curiam). The\ncontribution limits are unconstitutional because in their\nspecific details (involving low maximum levels and other\nrestrictions) they fail to satisfy the First Amendment’s\nrequirement of careful tailoring. Id., at 25–30. That is to\nsay, they impose burdens upon First Amendment interests\nthat (when viewed in light of the statute’s legitimate\nobjectives) are disproportionately severe.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   Prior to 1997, Vermont’s campaign finance law imposed\nno limit upon the amount a candidate for state office could\nspend. It did, however, impose limits upon the amounts\nthat individuals, corporations, and political committees\ncould contribute to the campaign of such a candidate.\nIndividuals and corporations could contribute no more\nthan $1,000 to any candidate for state office. §2805(a)\n(1996). Political committees, excluding political parties,\ncould contribute no more than $3,000. §2805(b). The\nstatute imposed no limit on the amount that political\nparties could contribute to candidates.\n   In 1997, Vermont enacted a more stringent campaign\nfinance law, Pub. Act No. 64, codified at Vt. Stat. Ann.,\nTit. 17, §2801 et seq. (2002) (hereinafter Act or Act 64), the\nstatute at issue here. Act 64, which took effect immedi\nately after the 1998 elections, imposes mandatory expen\nditure limits on the total amount a candidate for state\noffice can spend during a “two-year general election cycle,”\ni.e., the primary plus the general election, in approxi\nmately the following amounts: governor, $300,000; lieu\ntenant governor, $100,000; other statewide offices,\n$45,000; state senator, $4,000 (plus an additional $2,500\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           3\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nfor each additional seat in the district); state representa\ntive (two-member district), $3,000; and state representa\ntive (single member district), $2,000. §2805a(a). These\nlimits are adjusted for inflation in odd-numbered years\nbased on the Consumer Price Index. §2805a(e). Incum\nbents seeking reelection to statewide office may spend no\nmore than 85% of the above amounts, and incumbents\nseeking reelection to the State Senate or House may spend\nno more than 90% of the above amounts. §2805a(c). The\nAct defines “[e]xpenditure” broadly to mean the\n    “payment, disbursement, distribution, advance, de\n    posit, loan or gift of money or anything of value, paid\n    or promised to be paid, for the purpose of influencing\n    an election, advocating a position on a public question,\n    or supporting or opposing one or more candidates.”\n    §2801(3).\nWith certain minor exceptions, expenditures over $50\nmade on a candidate’s behalf by others count against the\ncandidate’s expenditure limit if those expenditures are\n“intentionally facilitated by, solicited by or approved by”\nthe candidate’s campaign. §§2809(b), (c). These provi\nsions apply so as to count against a campaign’s expendi\nture limit any spending by political parties or committees\nthat is coordinated with the campaign and benefits the\ncandidate. And any party expenditure that “primarily\nbenefits six or fewer candidates who are associated with\nthe political party” is “presumed” to be coordinated with\nthe campaign and therefore to count against the cam\npaign’s expenditure limit. §§2809(b), (d).\n   Act 64 also imposes strict contribution limits. The\namount any single individual can contribute to the cam\npaign of a candidate for state office during a “two-year\ngeneral election cycle” is limited as follows: governor,\nlieutenant governor, and other statewide offices, $400;\nstate senator, $300; and state representative, $200.\n4                   RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n§2805(a). Unlike its expenditure limits, Act 64’s contribu\ntion limits are not indexed for inflation.\n   A political committee is subject to these same limits.\nIbid. So is a political party, ibid., defined broadly to in\nclude “any subsidiary, branch or local unit” of a party, as\nwell as any “national or regional affiliates” of a party\n(taken separately or together). §2801(5). Thus, for exam\nple, the statute treats the local, state, and national affili\nates of the Democratic Party as if they were a single entity\nand limits their total contribution to a single candidate’s\ncampaign for governor (during the primary and the gen\neral election together) to $400.\n   The Act also imposes a limit of $2,000 upon the amount\nany individual can give to a political party during a 2-year\ngeneral election cycle. §2805(a).\n   The Act defines “contribution” broadly in approximately\nthe same way it defines “expenditure.” §2801(2). Any\nexpenditure made on a candidate’s behalf counts as a\ncontribution to the candidate if it is “intentionally facili\ntated by, solicited by or approved by” the candidate.\n§§2809(a), (c). And a party expenditure that “primarily\nbenefits six or fewer candidates who are associated with\nthe” party is “presumed” to count against the party’s\ncontribution limits. §§2809(a), (d).\n   There are a few exceptions. A candidate’s own contribu\ntions to the campaign and those of the candidate’s family\nfall outside the contribution limits. §2805(f). Volunteer\nservices do not count as contributions. §2801(2). Nor does\nthe cost of a meet-the-candidate function, provided that\nthe total cost for the function amounts to $100 or less.\n§2809(d).\n   In addition to these expenditure and contribution limits,\nthe Act sets forth disclosure and reporting requirements\nand creates a voluntary public financing system for gu\nbernatorial elections. §§2803, 2811, 2821–2823, 2831,\n2832, 2851–2856. None of these is at issue here. The Act\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            5\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nalso limits the amount of contributions a candidate, politi\ncal committee, or political party can receive from out-of\nstate sources. §2805(c). The lower courts held these out-\nof-state contribution limits unconstitutional, and the\nparties do not challenge that holding.\n                             B\n   The petitioners are individuals who have run for state\noffice in Vermont, citizens who vote in Vermont elections\nand contribute to Vermont campaigns, and political par\nties and committees that participate in Vermont politics.\nSoon after Act 64 became law, they brought this lawsuit in\nFederal District Court against the respondents, state\nofficials charged with enforcement of the Act. Several\nother private groups and individual citizens intervened in\nthe District Court proceedings in support of the Act and\nare joined here as respondents as well.\n   The District Court agreed with the petitioners that the\nAct’s expenditure limits violate the First Amendment. See\nBuckley, 424 U. S. 1. The court also held unconstitutional\nthe Act’s limits on the contributions of political parties to\ncandidates. At the same time, the court found the Act’s\nother contribution limits constitutional.        Landell v.\nSorrell, 118 F. Supp. 2d 470 (Vt. 2000).\n   Both sides appealed. A divided panel of the Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit held that all of the Act’s\ncontribution limits are constitutional. It also held that the\nAct’s expenditure limits may be constitutional. Landell v.\nSorrell, 382 F. 3d 91 (2004). It found those limits sup\nported by two compelling interests, namely, an interest in\npreventing corruption or the appearance of corruption and\nan interest in limiting the amount of time state officials\nmust spend raising campaign funds. The Circuit then\nremanded the case to the District Court with instructions\nto determine whether the Act’s expenditure limits were\nnarrowly tailored to those interests.\n6                  RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n  The petitioners and respondents all sought certiorari.\nThey asked us to consider the constitutionality of Act 64’s\nexpenditure limits, its contribution limits, and a related\ndefinitional provision. We agreed to do so. 545 U. S. ___\n(2005).\n                           II\n  We turn first to the Act’s expenditure limits. Do\nthose limits violate the First Amendment’s free speech\nguarantees?\n                                A\n   In Buckley v. Valeo, supra, the Court considered the\nconstitutionality of the Federal Election Campaign Act of\n1971 (FECA), 86 Stat. 3, as amended, 2 U. S. C. §431 et\nseq., a statute that, much like the Act before us, imposed\nboth expenditure and contribution limitations on cam\npaigns for public office. The Court, while upholding\nFECA’s contribution limitations as constitutional, held\nthat the statute’s expenditure limitations violated the\nFirst Amendment.\n   Buckley stated that both kinds of limitations “implicate\nfundamental First Amendment interests.” 424 U. S., at\n23. It noted that the Government had sought to justify the\nstatute’s infringement on those interests in terms of the\nneed to prevent “corruption and the appearance of corrup\ntion.” Id., at 25; see also id., at 55. In the Court’s view,\nthis rationale provided sufficient justification for the\nstatute’s contribution limitations, but it did not provide\nsufficient justification for the expenditure limitations.\n   The Court explained that the basic reason for this dif\nference between the two kinds of limitations is that ex\npenditure limitations “impose significantly more severe\nrestrictions on protected freedoms of political expression\nand association than” do contribution limitations. Id., at\n23. Contribution limitations, though a “marginal restric\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ntion upon the contributor’s ability to engage in free com\nmunication,” nevertheless leave the contributor “fre[e] to\ndiscuss candidates and issues.” Id., at 20–21. Expendi\nture limitations, by contrast, impose “[a] restriction on the\namount of money a person or group can spend on political\ncommunication during a campaign.” Id., at 19. They\nthereby necessarily “reduc[e] the quantity of expression by\nrestricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of\ntheir exploration, and the size of the audience reached.”\nIbid. Indeed, the freedom “to engage in unlimited political\nexpression subject to a ceiling on expenditures is like\nbeing free to drive an automobile as far and as often as\none desires on a single tank of gasoline.” Id., at 19, n. 18.\n   The Court concluded that “[n]o governmental interest\nthat has been suggested is sufficient to justify the restric\ntion on the quantity of political expression imposed by” the\nstatute’s expenditure limitations. Id., at 55. It decided\nthat the Government’s primary justification for expendi\nture limitations, preventing corruption and its appear\nance, was adequately addressed by the Act’s contribution\nlimitations and disclosure requirements. Ibid. The Court\nalso considered other governmental interests advanced in\nsupport of expenditure limitations. It rejected each. Id.,\nat 56–57. Consequently, it held that the expenditure\nlimitations were “constitutionally invalid.” Id., at 58.\n   Over the last 30 years, in considering the constitutional\nity of a host of different campaign finance statutes, this\nCourt has repeatedly adhered to Buckley’s constraints,\nincluding those on expenditure limits. See McConnell v.\nFederal Election Comm’n, 540 U. S. 93, 134 (2003); Fed\neral Election Comm’n v. Colorado Republican Federal\nCampaign Comm., 533 U. S. 431, 441 (2001) (Colorado II);\nNixon v.

They seek to overcome that\nprecedent in two ways. First, they ask us in effect to\noverrule Buckley. Post-Buckley experience, they believe,\nhas shown that contribution limits (and disclosure re\nquirements) alone cannot effectively deter corruption or its\nappearance; hence experience has undermined an assump\ntion underlying that case. Indeed, the respondents have\ndevoted several pages of their briefs to attacking Buckley’s\nholding on expenditure limits. See Brief for Respondent-\nCross-Petitioner Vermont Public Interest Research Group\net al. 36–39 (arguing that “sound reasons exist to revisit\nthe applicable standard of review” for expenditure limits);\nBrief for Respondent-Cross-Petitioner William Sorrell\net al. 28–31 (arguing that “the Court should revisit Buck\nley and consider alternative constitutional approaches to\nspending limits”).\n   Second, in the alternative, they ask us to limit the scope\nof Buckley significantly by distinguishing Buckley from the\npresent case. They advance as a ground for distinction a\njustification for expenditure limitations that, they say,\nBuckley did not consider, namely that such limits help to\nprotect candidates from spending too much time raising\nmoney rather than devoting that time to campaigning\namong ordinary voters. We find neither argument\npersuasive.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            9\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n                              2\n  The Court has often recognized the “fundamental impor\ntance” of stare decisis, the basic legal principle that com\nmands judicial respect for a court’s earlier decisions and\nthe rules of law they embody. See Harris v. United States,\n536 U. S. 545, 556–557 (2002) (plurality opinion) (citing\nnumerous cases). The Court has pointed out that stare\ndecisis “ ‘promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and con\nsistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on\njudicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and per\nceived integrity of the judicial process.’ ” United States v.\nInternational Business Machines Corp., 517 U. S. 843, 856\n(1996) (quoting Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827\n(1991)). Stare decisis thereby avoids the instability and\nunfairness that accompany disruption of settled legal\nexpectations. For this reason, the rule of law demands\nthat adhering to our prior case law be the norm. Depar\nture from precedent is exceptional, and requires “special\njustification.” Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212\n(1984). This is especially true where, as here, the princi\nple has become settled through iteration and reiteration\nover a long period of time.\n  We can find here no such special justification that would\nrequire us to overrule Buckley. Subsequent case law has\nnot made Buckley a legal anomaly or otherwise under\nmined its basic legal principles. Cf. Dickerson v. United\nStates, 530 U. S. 428, 443 (2000). We cannot find in the\nrespondents’ claims any demonstration that circumstances\nhave changed so radically as to undermine Buckley’s\ncritical factual assumptions. The respondents have not\nshown, for example, any dramatic increase in corruption\nor its appearance in Vermont; nor have they shown that\nexpenditure limits are the only way to attack that prob\nlem. Cf. McConnell v. FEC, 540 U. S. 93. At the same\ntime, Buckley has promoted considerable reliance. Con\ngress and state legislatures have used Buckley when\n10                 RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ndrafting campaign finance laws. And, as we have said,\nthis Court has followed Buckley, upholding and applying\nits reasoning in later cases. Overruling Buckley now\nwould dramatically undermine this reliance on our settled\nprecedent.\n   For all these reasons, we find this a case that fits the\nstare decisis norm. And we do not perceive the strong\njustification that would be necessary to warrant overrul\ning so well established a precedent. We consequently\ndecline the respondents’ invitation to reconsider Buckley.\n                               3\n   The respondents also ask us to distinguish these cases\nfrom Buckley. But we can find no significant basis for that\ndistinction. Act 64’s expenditure limits are not substan\ntially different from those at issue in Buckley. In both\ninstances the limits consist of a dollar cap imposed upon a\ncandidate’s expenditures. Nor is Vermont’s primary justi\nfication for imposing its expenditure limits significantly\ndifferent from Congress’ rationale for the Buckley limits:\npreventing corruption and its appearance.\n   The sole basis on which the respondents seek to distin\nguish Buckley concerns a further supporting justification.\nThey argue that expenditure limits are necessary in order\nto reduce the amount of time candidates must spend\nraising money.      Brief for Respondent/Cross-Petitioner\nVermont Public Interest Research Group et al. 16–20;\nBrief for Respondent/Cross-Petitioner William H. Sorrell\net al. 22–25. Increased campaign costs, together with the\nfear of a better-funded opponent, mean that, without\nexpenditure limits, a candidate must spend too much time\nraising money instead of meeting the voters and engaging\nin public debate. Buckley, the respondents add, did not\nfully consider this justification. Had it done so, they say,\nthe Court would have upheld, not struck down, FECA’s\nexpenditure limits.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           11\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n   In our view, it is highly unlikely that fuller considera\ntion of this time protection rationale would have changed\nBuckley’s result. The Buckley Court was aware of the\nconnection between expenditure limits and a reduction in\nfundraising time. In a section of the opinion dealing with\nFECA’s public financing provisions, it wrote that Congress\nwas trying to “free candidates from the rigors of fundrais\ning.” 424 U. S., at 91; see also id., at 96 (“[L]imits on\ncontributions necessarily increase the burden of fundrais\ning,” and “public financing” was designed in part to relieve\nPresidential candidates “from the rigors of soliciting pri\nvate contributions”); id., at 258–259 (White, J., concurring\nin part and dissenting in part) (same). The Court of Ap\npeals’ opinion and the briefs filed in this Court pointed out\nthat a natural consequence of higher campaign expendi\ntures was that “candidates were compelled to allow to fund\nraising increasing and extreme amounts of money and\nenergy.” Buckley v. Valeo, 519 F. 2d 821, 838 (CADC\n1975); see also Brief for United States et al. as Amici\nCuriae in Buckley v. Valeo, O. T. 1975, Nos. 75–436 and\n75–437, p. 36 (“Fund raising consumes candidate time\nthat otherwise would be devoted to campaigning”). And,\nin any event, the connection between high campaign ex\npenditures and increased fundraising demands seems\nperfectly obvious.\n   Under these circumstances, the respondents’ argument\namounts to no more than an invitation so to limit Buck\nley’s holding as effectively to overrule it. For the reasons\nset forth above, we decline that invitation as well. And,\ngiven Buckley’s continued authority, we must con\nclude that Act 64’s expenditure limits violate the First\nAmendment.\n                             III\n  We turn now to a more complex question, namely the\nconstitutionality of Act 64’s contribution limits. The par\n12                  RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nties, while accepting Buckley’s approach, dispute whether,\ndespite Buckley’s general approval of statutes that limit\ncampaign contributions, Act 64’s contribution limits are so\nsevere that in the circumstances its particular limits\nviolate the First Amendment.\n                               A\n   As with the Act’s expenditure limits, we begin with\nBuckley. In that case, the Court upheld the $1,000 contri\nbution limit before it. Buckley recognized that contribu\ntion limits, like expenditure limits, “implicate fundamen\ntal First Amendment interests,” namely, the freedoms of\n“political expression” and “political association.” 424 U. S.,\nat 15, 23. But, unlike expenditure limits (which “necessar\nily reduc[e] the quantity of expression by restricting the\nnumber of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration,\nand the size of the audience reached,” id., at 19), contribu\ntion limits “involv[e] little direct restraint on” the con\ntributor’s speech, id., at 21. They do restrict “one aspect of\nthe contributor’s freedom of political association,” namely,\nthe contributor’s ability to support a favored candidate,\nbut they nonetheless “permi[t] the symbolic expression of\nsupport evidenced by a contribution,” and they do “not in\nany way infringe the contributor’s freedom to discuss\ncandidates and issues.” Id., at 21, 24.\n   Consequently, the Court wrote, contribution limitations\nare permissible as long as the Government demonstrates\nthat the limits are “closely drawn” to match a “sufficiently\nimportant interest.” Id., at 25. It found that the interest\nadvanced in the case, “prevent[ing] corruption” and its\n“appearance,” was “sufficiently important” to justify the\nstatute’s contribution limits. Id., at 25–26.\n   The Court also found that the contribution limits before\nit were “closely drawn.” It recognized that, in determining\nwhether a particular contribution limit was “closely\ndrawn,” the amount, or level, of that limit could make a\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           13\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ndifference. Indeed, it wrote that “contribution restrictions\ncould have a severe impact on political dialogue if the\nlimitations prevented candidates and political committees\nfrom amassing the resources necessary for effective advo\ncacy.” Id., at 21. But the Court added that such “distinc\ntions in degree become significant only when they can be\nsaid to amount to differences in kind.” Id., at 30. Pointing\nout that it had “no scalpel to probe, whether, say, a $2,000\nceiling might not serve as well as $1,000,” ibid., the Court\nfound “no indication” that the $1,000 contribution limita\ntions imposed by the Act would have “any dramatic ad\nverse effect on the funding of campaigns,” id., at 21. It\ntherefore found the limitations constitutional.\n   Since Buckley, the Court has consistently upheld contri\nbution limits in other statutes. Shrink, 528 U. S. 377\n($1075 limit on contributions to candidates for Missouri\nstate auditor); California Medical Assn., 453 U. S. 182\n($5,000 limit on contributions to multicandidate political\ncommittees). The Court has recognized, however, that\ncontribution limits might sometimes work more harm to\nprotected First Amendment interests than their anticor\nruption objectives could justify. See Shrink, supra, at\n395–397; Buckley, supra, at 21. And individual Members\nof the Court have expressed concern lest too low a limit\nmagnify the “reputation-related or media-related advan\ntages of incumbency and thereby insulat[e] legislators\nfrom effective electoral challenge.” Shrink, supra, at 403–\n404 (BREYER, J., joined by GINSBURG, J., concurring). In\nthe cases before us, the petitioners challenge Act 64’s\ncontribution limits on that basis.\n                             B\n  Following Buckley, we must determine whether Act 64’s\ncontribution limits prevent candidates from “amassing the\nresources necessary for effective [campaign] advocacy,”\n424 U. S., at 21; whether they magnify the advantages of\n14                  RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nincumbency to the point where they put challengers to a\nsignificant disadvantage; in a word, whether they are too\nlow and too strict to survive First Amendment scrutiny.\nIn answering these questions, we recognize, as Buckley\nstated, that we have “no scalpel to probe” each possible\ncontribution level. Id., at 30. We cannot determine with\nany degree of exactitude the precise restriction necessary\nto carry out the statute’s legitimate objectives. In practice,\nthe legislature is better equipped to make such empirical\njudgments, as legislators have “particular expertise” in\nmatters related to the costs and nature of running for\noffice. McConnell, 540 U. S., at 137. Thus ordinarily we\nhave deferred to the legislature’s determination of such\nmatters.\n   Nonetheless, as Buckley acknowledged, we must recog\nnize the existence of some lower bound. At some point the\nconstitutional risks to the democratic electoral process\nbecome too great. After all, the interests underlying con\ntribution limits, preventing corruption and the appearance\nof corruption, “directly implicate the integrity of our elec\ntoral process.” McConnell, supra, at 136 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted). Yet that rationale does not simply\nmean “the lower the limit, the better.” That is because\ncontribution limits that are too low can also harm the\nelectoral process by preventing challengers from mounting\neffective campaigns against incumbent officeholders,\nthereby reducing democratic accountability. Were we to\nignore that fact, a statute that seeks to regulate campaign\ncontributions could itself prove an obstacle to the very\nelectoral fairness it seeks to promote. Thus, we see no\nalternative to the exercise of independent judicial judg\nment as a statute reaches those outer limits. And, where\nthere is strong indication in a particular case, i.e., danger\nsigns, that such risks exist (both present in kind and likely\nserious in degree), courts, including appellate courts, must\nreview the record independently and carefully with an eye\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           15\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ntoward assessing the statute’s “tailoring,” that is, toward\nassessing the proportionality of the restrictions. See Bose\nCorp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U. S.\n485, 499 (1984) (“[A]n appellate court has an obligation to\n‘make an independent examination of the whole record’ in\norder to make sure that ‘the judgment does not constitute\na forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression’ ”\n(quoting New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254,\n284–286 (1964))).\n  We find those danger signs present here. As compared\nwith the contribution limits upheld by the Court in the\npast, and with those in force in other States, Act 64’s\nlimits are sufficiently low as to generate suspicion that\nthey are not closely drawn. The Act sets its limits per\nelection cycle, which includes both a primary and a gen\neral election. Thus, in a gubernatorial race with both\nprimary and final election contests, the Act’s contribution\nlimit amounts to $200 per election per candidate (with\nsignificantly lower limits for contributions to candidates\nfor State Senate and House of Representatives, see supra,\nat 3). These limits apply both to contributions from indi\nviduals and to contributions from political parties,\nwhether made in cash or in expenditures coordinated (or\npresumed to be coordinated) with the candidate. See\nsupra, at 3–4.\n  These limits are well below the limits this Court upheld\nin Buckley. Indeed, in terms of real dollars (i.e., adjusting\nfor inflation), the Act’s $200 per election limit on individ\nual contributions to a campaign for governor is slightly\nmore than one-twentieth of the limit on contributions to\ncampaigns for federal office before the Court in Buckley.\nAdjusted to reflect its value in 1976 (the year Buckley was\ndecided), Vermont’s contribution limit on campaigns for\nstatewide office (including governor) amounts to $113.91\nper 2-year election cycle, or roughly $57 per election, as\ncompared to the $1,000 per election limit on individual\n16                  RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ncontributions at issue in Buckley. (The adjusted value of\nAct 64’s limit on contributions from political parties to\ncandidates for statewide office, again $200 per candidate\nper election, is just over one one-hundredth of the compa\nrable limit before the Court in Buckley, $5,000 per elec\ntion.) Yet Vermont’s gubernatorial district—the entire\nState—is no smaller than the House districts to which\nBuckley’s limits applied. In 1976, the average congres\nsional district contained a population of about 465,000.\nDept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract\nof the United States 459 (1976) (Statistical Abstract)\n(describing results of 1970 census). Indeed, Vermont’s\npopulation is 621,000—about one-third larger. Statistical\nAbstract 21 (2006) (describing Vermont’s population in\n2004).\n   Moreover, considered as a whole, Vermont’s contribution\nlimits are the lowest in the Nation. Act 64 limits contribu\ntions to candidates for statewide office (including gover\nnor) to $200 per candidate per election. We have found no\nState that imposes a lower per election limit. Indeed, we\nhave found only seven States that impose limits on contri\nbutions to candidates for statewide office at or below $500\nper election, more than twice Act 64’s limit. Cf. Ariz. Rev.\nStat. Ann. §16–905 (West Cum. Supp. 2005) ($760 per\nelection cycle, or $380 per election, adjusted for inflation);\nColo. Const., Art. XXVIII, §3 ($500 per election, adjusted\nfor inflation); Fla. Stat. §106.08(1)(a) (2003) ($500 per\nelection); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 21A, §1015(1) (1993)\n($500 for governor, $250 for other statewide office, per\nelection); Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 55, §7A (West Supp. 2006)\n($500 per year, or $250 per election); Mont. Code Ann.\n§13–37–216(1)(a) (2005) ($500 for governor, $250 for other\nstatewide office, per election); S. D. Codified Laws §12–25–\n1.1 (2004) ($1,000 per year, or $500 per election). We are\naware of no State that imposes a limit on contributions\nfrom political parties to candidates for statewide office\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            17\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nlower than Act 64’s $200 per candidate per election limit.\nCf. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 21A, §1015(1) (1993) (next\nlowest: $500 for contribution from party to candidate for\ngovernor, $250 for contribution from party to candidate for\nother statewide office, both per election). Similarly, we\nhave found only three States that have limits on contribu\ntions to candidates for state legislature below Act 64’s\n$150 and $100 per election limits. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n§16–905 (West Cum. Supp. 2005) ($296 per election cycle,\nor $148 per election); Mont. Code Ann. §13–37–216(1)(a)\n(2005) ($130 per election); S. D. Codified Laws §12–25–1.1\n(2004) ($250 per year, or $125 per election). And we are\naware of no State that has a lower limit on contributions\nfrom political parties to state legislative candidates. Cf.\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 21A, §1015(1) (1993) (next lowest:\n$250 per election).\n   Finally, Vermont’s limit is well below the lowest limit\nthis Court has previously upheld, the limit of $1,075 per\nelection (adjusted for inflation every two years, see Mo.\nRev. Stat. §130.032.2 (1998 Cum. Supp.)) for candidates\nfor Missouri state auditor. Shrink, 528 U. S. 377. The\ncomparable Vermont limit of roughly $200 per election,\nnot adjusted for inflation, is less than one-sixth of Mis\nsouri’s current inflation-adjusted limit ($1,275).\n   We recognize that Vermont’s population is much smaller\nthan Missouri’s. Indeed, Vermont is about one-ninth of\nthe size of Missouri. Statistical Abstract 21 (2006). Thus,\nper citizen, Vermont’s limit is slightly more generous. As\nof 2006, the ratio of the contribution limit to the size of the\nconstituency in Vermont is .00064, while Missouri’s ratio\nis .00044, 31% lower. Cf. App. 55 (doing same calculation\nin 2000).\n   But this does not necessarily mean that Vermont’s\nlimits are less objectionable than the limit upheld in\nShrink. A campaign for state auditor is likely to be less\ncostly than a campaign for governor; campaign costs do\n18                 RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nnot automatically increase or decrease in precise propor\ntion to the size of an electoral district. See App. 66 (1998\nwinning candidate for Vermont state auditor spent about\n$60,000; winning candidate for governor spent about\n$340,000); Opensecrets.org, The Big Picture, 2004 Cycle:\nHot Races, available at http://www.opensecrets.org/\nbigpicture/hotraces.asp?cycle=2004 (as visited June 22,\n2006, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file) (U. S.\nSenate campaigns identified as competitive spend less per\nvoter than U. S. House campaigns identified as competi\ntive). Moreover, Vermont’s limits, unlike Missouri’s lim\nits, apply in the same amounts to contributions made by\npolitical parties. Mo. Rev. Stat. §130.032.4 (2000) (enact\ning limits on contributions from political parties to candi\ndates 10 times higher than limits on contributions from\nindividuals). And, as we have said, Missouri’s (current)\n$1,275 per election limit, unlike Vermont’s $200 per elec\ntion limit, is indexed for inflation. See supra, at 17; see\nalso Mo. Rev. Stat. §130.032.2 (2000).\n    The factors we have mentioned offset any neutralizing\nforce of population differences. At the very least, they\nmake it difficult to treat Shrink’s (then) $1,075 limit as\nproviding affirmative support for the lawfulness of Ver\nmont’s far lower levels. Cf. 528 U. S., at 404 (BREYER, J.,\nconcurring) (The Shrink “limit . . . is low enough to raise\n. . . a [significant constitutional] question”). And even\nwere that not so, Vermont’s failure to index for inflation\nmeans that Vermont’s levels would soon be far lower than\nMissouri’s regardless of the method of comparison.\n    In sum, Act 64’s contribution limits are substantially\nlower than both the limits we have previously upheld and\ncomparable limits in other States. These are danger signs\nthat Act 64’s contribution limits may fall outside tolerable\nFirst Amendment limits. We consequently must examine\nthe record independently and carefully to determine\nwhether Act 64’s contribution limits are “closely drawn” to\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          19\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nmatch the State’s interests.\n                               C\n   Our examination of the record convinces us that, from a\nconstitutional perspective, Act 64’s contribution limits are\ntoo restrictive. We reach this conclusion based not merely\non the low dollar amounts of the limits themselves, but\nalso on the statute’s effect on political parties and on\nvolunteer activity in Vermont elections. Taken together,\nAct 64’s substantial restrictions on the ability of candi\ndates to raise the funds necessary to run a competitive\nelection, on the ability of political parties to help their\ncandidates get elected, and on the ability of individual\ncitizens to volunteer their time to campaigns show that\nthe Act is not closely drawn to meet its objectives. In\nparticular, five factors together lead us to this decision.\n   First, the record suggests, though it does not conclu\nsively prove, that Act 64’s contribution limits will signifi\ncantly restrict the amount of funding available for chal\nlengers to run competitive campaigns. For one thing, the\npetitioners’ expert, Clark Bensen, conducted a race-by\nrace analysis of the 1998 legislative elections (the last to\ntake place before Act 64 took effect) and concluded that\nAct 64’s contribution limits would have reduced the funds\navailable in 1998 to Republican challengers in competitive\nraces in amounts ranging from 18% to 53% of their total\ncampaign income. See 3 Tr. 52–57 (estimating loss of 47%\nof funds for candidate Tully, 50% for Harvey, 53% for\nWelch, 19% for Bahre, 29% for Delaney, 36% for LaRoc\nque, 18% for Smith, and 31% for Brown).\n   For another thing, the petitioners’ expert witnesses\nproduced evidence and analysis showing that Vermont\npolitical parties (particularly the Republican Party) “tar\nget” their contributions to candidates in competitive races,\nthat those contributions represent a significant amount of\ntotal candidate funding in such races, and that the contri\n20                  RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nbution limits will cut the parties’ contributions to competi\ntive races dramatically. See 1 id., at 189–190; 3 id., at 50–\n51; 8 id., at 139; 10 id., at 150; see also, e.g., Gierzynski &\nBreaux, The Role of Parties in Legislative Campaign\nFinancing, 15 Am. Rev. Politics 171 (1994); Thompson,\nCassie, & Jewell, A Sacred Cow or Just a Lot of Bull?\nParty and PAC Money in State Legislative Elections, 47\nPol. Sci. Q. 223 (1994). Their statistics showed that the\nparty contributions accounted for a significant percentage\nof the total campaign income in those races. And their\nstudies showed that Act 64’s contribution limits would cut\nthe party contributions by between 85% (for the legisla\nture on average) and 99% (for governor).\n   More specifically, Bensen pointed out that in 1998, the\nRepublican Party made contributions to 19 Senate cam\npaigns in amounts that averaged $2,001, which on average\nrepresented 16% of the recipient campaign’s total income.\n3 Tr. 84. Act 64 would reduce these contributions to $300\nper campaign, an average reduction of about 85%. Ibid.\nThe party contributed to 50 House campaigns in amounts\naveraging $787, which on average represented 28% of the\nrecipient campaign’s total income. Id., at 85. Act 64\nwould reduce these contributions to $200 per campaign,\nan average reduction of 74.5%. Ibid. And the party con\ntributed $40,600 to its gubernatorial candidate, an\namount that accounted for about 16% of the candidate’s\nfunding. Id., at 86. The Act would have reduced that\ncontribution by 99%, to $400.\n   Bensen added that 57% of all 1998 Senate campaigns\nand 30% of all House campaigns exceeded Act 64’s expen\nditure limits, which were enacted along with the statute’s\ncontribution limits. 7 Trial Exhs. in No. 00–9159(L) etc.\n(CA2), Exh. 8, p. 2351. Moreover, 27% of all Senate cam\npaigns and 10% of all House campaigns spent more than\ndouble those limits. Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           21\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n   The respondents did not contest these figures. Rather,\nthey presented evidence that focused, not upon strongly\ncontested campaigns, but upon the funding amounts avail\nable for the average campaign. The respondents’ expert,\nAnthony Gierzynski, concluded, for example, that Act 64\nwould have a “minimal effect on . . . candidates’ ability to\nraise funds.” App. 46. But he rested this conclusion upon\nhis finding that “only a small proportion of” all contribu\ntions to all campaigns for state office “made during the\nlast three elections would have been affected by the new\nlimits.” Id., at 47; see also id., at 51 (discussing “average\namount of revenues lost to the limits” in legislative races\n(emphasis added)); id., at 52–53 (discussing total number\nof campaigns receiving contributions over Act 64’s limit).\nThe lower courts similarly relied almost exclusively on\naverages in assessing Act 64’s effect. See 118 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 470 (“Approximately 88% to 96% of the campaign con\ntributions to recent House races were under $200” (empha\nsis added)); id., at 478 (“Expert testimony revealed that\nover the last three election cycles the percentage of all\ncandidates’ contributions received over the contribution\nlimits was less than 10%” (emphasis added)).\n   The respondents’ evidence leaves the petitioners’ evi\ndence unrebutted in certain key respects. That is because\nthe critical question concerns not simply the average effect\nof contribution limits on fundraising but, more impor\ntantly, the ability of a candidate running against an in\ncumbent officeholder to mount an effective challenge. And\ninformation about average races, rather than competitive\nraces, is only distantly related to that question, because\ncompetitive races are likely to be far more expensive than\nthe average race. See, e.g., N. Ornstein, T. Mann, & M.\nMalbin, Vital Statistics on Congress 2001–2002, pp. 89–98\n(2002) (data showing that spending in competitive elec\ntions, i.e., where incumbent wins with less than 60% of\nvote or where incumbent loses, is far greater than in most\n22                  RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nelections, where incumbent wins with more than 60% of\nthe vote). We concede that the record does contain some\nanecdotal evidence supporting the respondents’ position,\nnamely, testimony about a post-Act-64 competitive may\noral campaign in Burlington, which suggests that a chal\nlenger can “amas[s] the resources necessary for effective\nadvocacy,” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 21. But the facts of that\nparticular election are not described in sufficient detail to\noffer a convincing refutation of the implication arising\nfrom the petitioners’ experts’ studies.\n  Rather, the petitioners’ studies, taken together with low\naverage Vermont campaign expenditures and the typically\nhigher costs that a challenger must bear to overcome the\nname-recognition advantage enjoyed by an incumbent,\nraise a reasonable inference that the contribution limits\nare so low that they may pose a significant obstacle to\ncandidates in competitive elections. Cf. Ornstein, supra,\nat 87–96 (In 2000 U. S. House and Senate elections, suc\ncessful challengers spent far more than the average candi\ndate). Information about average races does not rebut\nthat inference. Consequently, the inference amounts to\none factor (among others) that here counts against the\nconstitutional validity of the contribution limits.\n  Second, Act 64’s insistence that political parties abide by\nexactly the same low contribution limits that apply to\nother contributors threatens harm to a particularly impor\ntant political right, the right to associate in a political\nparty. See, e.g., California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530\nU. S. 567, 574 (2000) (describing constitutional impor\ntance of associating in political parties to elect candi\ndates); Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U. S.\n351, 357 (1997) (same); Colorado I, 518 U. S., at 616\n(same); Norman v. Reed, 502 U. S. 279, 288 (1992) (same).\nCf. Buckley, supra, at 20–22 (contribution limits constitute\n“only a marginal restriction” on First Amendment rights\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            23\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nbecause contributor remains free to associate politically,\ne.g., in a political party, and “assist personally” in the\nparty’s “efforts on behalf of candidates”).\n   The Act applies its $200 to $400 limits—precisely the\nsame limits it applies to an individual—to virtually all\naffiliates of a political party taken together as if they were\na single contributor. Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17, §2805(a)\n(2002). That means, for example, that the Vermont De\nmocratic Party, taken together with all its local affiliates,\ncan make one contribution of at most $400 to the Democ\nratic gubernatorial candidate, one contribution of at most\n$300 to a Democratic candidate for State Senate, and one\ncontribution of at most $200 to a Democratic candidate for\nthe State House of Representatives. The Act includes\nwithin these limits not only direct monetary contributions\nbut also expenditures in kind: stamps, stationery, coffee,\ndoughnuts, gasoline, campaign buttons, and so forth. See\n§2801(2). Indeed, it includes all party expenditures “in\ntended to promote the election of a specific candidate or\ngroup of candidates” as long as the candidate’s campaign\n“facilitate[s],” “solicit[s],” or “approve[s]” them. §§2809(a),\n(c). And a party expenditure that “primarily benefits six\nor fewer candidates who are associated with the” party is\n“presumed” to count against the party’s contribution\nlimits. §2809(d).\n   In addition to the negative effect on “amassing funds”\nthat we have described, see supra, at 18–21, the Act would\nseverely limit the ability of a party to assist its candidates’\ncampaigns by engaging in coordinated spending on adver\ntising, candidate events, voter lists, mass mailings, even\nyard signs. And, to an unusual degree, it would discour\nage those who wish to contribute small amounts of money\nto a party, amounts that easily comply with individual\ncontribution limits. Suppose that many individuals do not\nknow Vermont legislative candidates personally, but wish\n24                 RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nto contribute, say, $20 or $40, to the State Republican\nParty, with the intent that the party use the money to\nhelp elect whichever candidates the party believes would\nbest advance its ideals and interests—the basic object of a\npolitical party. Or, to take a more extreme example,\nimagine that 6,000 Vermont citizens each want to give $1\nto the State Democratic Party because, though unfamiliar\nwith the details of the individual races, they would like to\nmake a small financial contribution to the goal of electing\na Democratic state legislature. And further imagine that\nthe party believes control of the legislature will depend on\nthe outcome of three (and only three) House races. The\nAct forbids the party from giving $2,000 (of the $6,000) to\neach of its candidates in those pivotal races. Indeed, it\npermits the party to give no more than $200 to each can\ndidate, thereby thwarting the aims of the 6,000 donors\nfrom making a meaningful contribution to state politics by\ngiving a small amount of money to the party they support.\nThus, the Act would severely inhibit collective political\nactivity by preventing a political party from using contri\nbutions by small donors to provide meaningful assistance\nto any individual candidate. See supra, at 19.\n   We recognize that we have previously upheld limits on\ncontributions from political parties to candidates, in par\nticular the federal limits on coordinated party spending.\nColorado II, 533 U. S. 431. And we also recognize that any\nsuch limit will negatively affect to some extent the fund-\nallocating party function just described. But the contribu\ntion limits at issue in Colorado II were far less problem\natic, for they were significantly higher than Act 64’s lim\nits. See id., at 438–439, and n. 3, 442, n. 7 (at least\n$67,560 in coordinated spending and $5,000 in direct cash\ncontributions for U. S. Senate candidates, at least $33,780\nin coordinated spending and $5,000 in direct cash contri\nbutions for U. S. House candidates). And they were much\nhigher than the federal limits on contributions from indi\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

Act\n64, by placing identical limits upon contributions to candi\ndates, whether made by an individual or by a political\nparty, gives to the former consideration no weight at all.\n   We consequently agree with the District Court that the\nAct’s contribution limits “would reduce the voice of politi\ncal parties” in Vermont to a “whisper.” 118 F. Supp. 2d, at\n487. And we count the special party-related harms that\nAct 64 threatens as a further factor weighing against the\nconstitutional validity of the contribution limits.\n   Third, the Act’s treatment of volunteer services aggra\nvates the problem. Like its federal statutory counterpart,\nthe Act excludes from its definition of “contribution” all\n“services provided without compensation by individuals\nvolunteering their time on behalf of a candidate.” Vt. Stat.\nAnn., Tit. 17, §2801(2) (2002). Cf. 2 U. S. C. §431(8)(B)(i)\n(2000 ed. and Supp. III) (similar exemption in federal\ncampaign finance statute). But the Act does not exclude\nthe expenses those volunteers incur, such as travel ex\npenses, in the course of campaign activities. The Act’s\nbroad definitions would seem to count those expenses\nagainst the volunteer’s contribution limit, at least where\nthe spending was facilitated or approved by campaign\nofficials.    Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17, §2801(3) (2002)\n(“[E]xpenditure” includes “anything of value, paid . . . for\nthe purpose of influencing an election”); §§2809(a), (c) (Any\n“expenditure . . . intentionally facilitated by, solicited by or\napproved by the candidate” counts as a “contribution”).\nAnd, unlike the Federal Government’s treatment of com\nparable requirements, the State has not (insofar as we are\n26                 RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\naware) created an exception excluding such expenses. Cf.\n2 U. S. C. §§431(8)(B)(iv), (ix) (2000 ed. and Supp. III)\n(excluding from the definition of “contribution” volunteer\ntravel expenses up to $1,000 and payment by political\nparty for campaign materials used in connection with\nvolunteer activities).\n   The absence of some such exception may matter in the\npresent context, where contribution limits are very low.\nThat combination, low limits and no exceptions, means\nthat a gubernatorial campaign volunteer who makes four\nor five round trips driving across the State performing\nvolunteer activities coordinated with the campaign can\nfind that he or she is near, or has surpassed, the contribu\ntion limit. So too will a volunteer who offers a campaign\nthe use of her house along with coffee and doughnuts for a\nfew dozen neighbors to meet the candidate, say, two or\nthree times during a campaign. Cf. Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17,\n§2809(d) (2002) (excluding expenditures for such activities\nonly up to $100). Such supporters will have to keep care\nful track of all miles driven, postage supplied (500 stamps\nequals $200), pencils and pads used, and so forth. And\nany carelessness in this respect can prove costly, perhaps\ngenerating a headline, “Campaign laws violated,” that\nworks serious harm to the candidate.\n   These sorts of problems are unlikely to affect the consti\ntutionality of a limit that is reasonably high. Cf. Buckley,\n424 U. S., at 36–37 (Coordinated expenditure by a volun\nteer “provides material financial assistance to a candi\ndate,” and therefore “may properly be viewed as a contri\nbution”). But Act 64’s contribution limits are so low, and\nits definition of “contribution” so broad, that the Act may\nwell impede a campaign’s ability effectively to use volun\nteers, thereby making it more difficult for individuals to\nassociate in this way. Cf. id., at 22 (Federal contribution\nlimits “leave the contributor free to become a member of\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           27\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nany political association and to assist personally in the\nassociation’s efforts on behalf of candidates”). Again, the\nvery low limits at issue help to transform differences in\ndegree into difference in kind. And the likelihood of un\njustified interference in the present context is sufficiently\ngreat that we must consider the lack of tailoring in the\nAct’s definition of “contribution” as an added factor count\ning against the constitutional validity of the contribution\nlimits before us.\n   Fourth, unlike the contribution limits we upheld in\nShrink, see supra, at 16, Act 64’s contribution limits are\nnot adjusted for inflation. Its limits decline in real value\neach year. Indeed, in real dollars the Act’s limits have\nalready declined by about 20% ($200 in 2006 dollars has a\nreal value of $160.66 in 1997 dollars). A failure to index\nlimits means that limits which are already suspiciously\nlow, see supra, at 14–17, will almost inevitably become too\nlow over time. It means that future legislation will be\nnecessary to stop that almost inevitable decline, and it\nthereby imposes the burden of preventing the decline upon\nincumbent legislators who may not diligently police the\nneed for changes in limit levels to assure the adequate\nfinancing of electoral challenges.\n   Fifth, we have found nowhere in the record any special\njustification that might warrant a contribution limit so\nlow or so restrictive as to bring about the serious associa\ntional and expressive problems that we have described.\nRather, the basic justifications the State has advanced in\nsupport of such limits are those present in Buckley. The\nrecord contains no indication that, for example, corruption\n(or its appearance) in Vermont is significantly more seri\nous a matter than elsewhere. Indeed, other things being\nequal, one might reasonably believe that a contribution of\nsay, $250 (or $450) to a candidate’s campaign was less\nlikely to prove a corruptive force than the far larger con\n28                  RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ntributions at issue in the other campaign finance cases we\nhave considered. See supra, at 15–17.\n   These five sets of considerations, taken together, lead us\nto conclude that Act 64’s contribution limits are not nar\nrowly tailored. Rather, the Act burdens First Amendment\ninterests by threatening to inhibit effective advocacy by\nthose who seek election, particularly challengers; its con\ntribution limits mute the voice of political parties; they\nhamper participation in campaigns through volunteer\nactivities; and they are not indexed for inflation. Vermont\ndoes not point to a legitimate statutory objective that\nmight justify these special burdens. We understand that\nmany, though not all, campaign finance regulations im\npose certain of these burdens to some degree. We also\nunderstand the legitimate need for constitutional leeway\nin respect to legislative line-drawing. But our discussion\nindicates why we conclude that Act 64 in this respect\nnonetheless goes too far. It disproportionately burdens\nnumerous First Amendment interests, and consequently,\nin our view, violates the First Amendment.\n   We add that we do not believe it possible to sever some\nof the Act’s contribution limit provisions from others that\nmight remain fully operative. See Champlin Refining Co.\nv. Corporation Comm’n of Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234 (1932)\n(“invalid part may be dropped if what is left is fully opera\ntive as a law”); see also Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of\nChippewa Indians, 526 U. S. 172, 191 (1999) (severability\n“essentially an inquiry into legislative intent”); Vt. Stat.\nAnn., Tit. 1, §215 (2003) (severability principles apply to\nVermont statutes). To sever provisions to avoid constitu\ntional objection here would require us to write words into\nthe statute (inflation indexing), or to leave gaping loop\nholes (no limits on party contributions), or to foresee which\nof many different possible ways the legislature might\nrespond to the constitutional objections we have found.\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           29\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nGiven these difficulties, we believe the Vermont Legisla\nture would have intended us to set aside the statute’s\ncontribution limits, leaving the legislature free to rewrite\nthose provisions in light of the constitutional difficulties\nwe have identified.\n                             IV\n   We conclude that Act 64’s expenditure limits violate the\nFirst Amendment as interpreted in Buckley v. Valeo. We\nalso conclude that the specific details of Act 64’s contribu\ntion limits require us to hold that those limits violate the\nFirst Amendment, for they burden First Amendment\ninterests in a manner that is disproportionate to the pub\nlic purposes they were enacted to advance. Given our\nholding, we need not, and do not, examine the constitu\ntionality of the statute’s presumption that certain party\nexpenditures are coordinated with a candidate. Vt. Stat.\nAnn., Tit. 17, §2809(d) (2002). Accordingly, the judgment\nof the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cases are\nremanded for further proceedings.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

Contrary to\nthe suggestion of those sections, respondents’ primary\ndefense of Vermont’s expenditure limits is that those\nlimits are consistent with Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1\n(1976) (per curiam). See Brief for William H.

I agree that both limitations violate the First\nAmendment.\n   As the plurality notes, our cases hold that expenditure\nlimitations “place substantial and direct restrictions on\nthe ability of candidates, citizens, and associations to\nengage in protected political expression, restrictions that\nthe First Amendment cannot tolerate.” Buckley v. Valeo,\n424 U. S. 1, 58–59 (1976) (per curiam); see also Colorado\nRepublican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election\nComm’n, 518 U.

S. 480, 497 (1985).\n  The parties neither ask the Court to overrule Buckley in\nfull nor challenge the level of scrutiny that decision ap\nplies to campaign contributions. The exacting scrutiny the\nplurality applies to expenditure limitations, however, is\nappropriate. For the reasons explained in the plurality\nopinion, respondents’ attempts to distinguish the present\nlimitations from those we have invalidated are unavailing.\nThe Court has upheld contribution limits that do “not\ncome even close to passing any serious scrutiny.” Nixon v.\nShrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 410\n(2000) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Those concerns aside,\nVermont’s contributions, as the plurality’s detailed analy\nsis indicates, are even more stifling than the ones that\nsurvived Shrink’s unduly lenient review.\n  The universe of campaign finance regulation is one this\nCourt has in part created and in part permitted by its\ncourse of decisions. That new order may cause more prob\nlems than it solves. On a routine, operational level the\npresent system requires us to explain why $200 is too\nrestrictive a limit while $1,500 is not. Our own experience\ngives us little basis to make these judgments, and cer\ntainly no traditional or well-established body of law exists\nto offer guidance. On a broader, systemic level political\nparties have been denied basic First Amendment rights.\nSee, e.g., McConnell v. Federal Election Comm’n, 540 U. S.\n93, 286–287, 313 (2003) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judg\nment in part and dissenting in part). Entering to fill the\nvoid have been new entities such as political action com\nmittees, which are as much the creatures of law as of\ntraditional forces of speech and association. Those entities\ncan manipulate the system and attract their own elite\npower brokers, who operate in ways obscure to the ordi\nnary citizen.\n  Viewed within the legal universe we have ratified and\nhelped create, the result the plurality reaches is correct;\n                Cite as: 548 U.

See ante, at 10 (noting, inter alia, that Buckley has\nengendered “considerable reliance” that would be “dramatically under\nmine[d]” by overruling it now).\n2                   RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nture limitations and, less persuasively, the contribution\nlimitations. I continue to believe that Buckley provides\ninsufficient protection to political speech, the core of the\nFirst Amendment. The illegitimacy of Buckley is further\nunderscored by the continuing inability of the Court (and\nthe plurality here) to apply Buckley in a coherent and\nprincipled fashion. As a result, stare decisis should pose\nno bar to overruling Buckley and replacing it with a stan\ndard faithful to the First Amendment. Accordingly, I\nconcur only in the judgment.\n                               I\n   I adhere to my view that this Court erred in Buckley\nwhen it distinguished between contribution and expendi\nture limits, finding the former to be a less severe in\nfringement on First Amendment rights. See Nixon v.\nShrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 410–418\n(2000) (dissenting opinion) (Shrink); Federal Election\nComm’n v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign\nComm., 533 U.

S. 604, 635–\n644 (1996) (Colorado I) (opinion concurring in judgment\nand dissenting in part). “[U]nlike the Buckley Court, I\nbelieve that contribution limits infringe as directly and as\nseriously upon freedom of political expression and associa\ntion as do expenditure limits.” Id., at 640. The Buckley\nCourt distinguished contributions from expenditures\nbased on the presence of an intermediary between a con\ntributor and the speech eventually produced. But that\nreliance is misguided, given that “[e]ven in the case of a\ndirect expenditure, there is usually some go-between that\nfacilitates the dissemination of the spender’s message.”\nColorado I, supra, at 638–639; Shrink, supra, at 413–418\n(Thomas, J., dissenting). Likewise, Buckley’s suggestion\nthat contribution caps only marginally restrict speech,\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            3\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nbecause “[a] contribution serves as a general expression of\nsupport for the candidate and his views, but does not\ncommunicate the underlying basis for the support,” 424\nU. S., at 21, even if descriptively accurate, does not sup\nport restrictions on contributions. After all, statements of\ngeneral support are as deserving of constitutional protec\ntion as those that communicate specific reasons for that\nsupport. Colorado I, supra, at 639–640 (opinion of Tho\nmas, J.); Shrink, supra, at 414–415, and n. 3 (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting). Accordingly, I would overrule Buckley and\nsubject both the contribution and expenditure restrictions\nof Act 64 to strict scrutiny, which they would fail. See\nColorado I, supra, at 640–641 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (“I\nam convinced that under traditional strict scrutiny, broad\nprophylactic caps on both spending and giving in the\npolitical process . . . are unconstitutional”).

S. 808, 827 (1991); internal quotation marks omitted).\nToday’s newly minted, multifactor test, particularly when\nread in combination with the Court’s decision in Shrink,\nsupra, places this Court in the position of addressing the\npropriety of regulations of political speech based upon\nlittle more than its impression of the appropriate limits.\n   The plurality sets forth what appears to be a two-step\n4                   RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nprocess for evaluating the validity of contribution limits:\nFirst, determine whether there are “danger signs” in a\nparticular case that the limits are too low; and, second,\nuse “independent judicial judgment” to “review the record\nindependently and carefully with an eye towards assessing\nthe statute’s ‘tailoring,’ that is, towards assessing the\nproportionality of the restrictions.” Ante, at 14. Neither\nstep of this test can be reduced to a workable inquiry to be\nperformed by States attempting to comply with this\nCourt’s jurisprudence.\n    As to the first step, it is entirely unclear how to deter\nmine whether limits are so low as to constitute “danger\nsigns” that require a court to “examine the record inde\npendently and carefully.” Ante, at 18. The plurality\npoints to several aspects of the Act that support its conclu\nsion that such signs are present here: (1) the limits are set\nper election cycle, rather than divided between primary\nand general elections; (2) the limits apply to contributions\nfrom political parties; (3) the limits are the lowest in the\nNation; and (4) the limits are below those we have previ\nously upheld. Ante, at 15–19.\n    The first two elements of the Act are indeed constitu\ntionally problematic, but they have no bearing on whether\nthe contribution limits are too low. The first substantially\nadvantages candidates in a general election who did not\nface a serious primary challenge. In practice, this restric\ntion will generally suppress more speech by challengers\nthan by incumbents, without serving the interests the\nCourt has recognized as compelling, i.e., the prevention of\ncorruption or the appearance thereof. Cf. B. Smith, Un\nfree Speech: The Folly of Campaign Finance Reform 50–51\n(2001) (hereinafter Smith) (describing the ability of in\ncumbents to amass money early, discouraging serious\nchallengers from entering a race). The second element has\nno relation to these compelling interests either, given that\n“ ‘[t]he very aim of a political party is to influence its can\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

S., at 476\n(Thomas, J., dissenting) (citing Colorado I, 518 U. S., at\n646 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in\npart)). That these provisions are unconstitutional, how\never, does not make the contribution limits on individuals\nunconstitutionally low.\n   We are left, then, with two reasons to scrutinize Act 64’s\nlimitations: They are lower than those of other States, and\nlower than those we have upheld in previous cases, i.e.,\nBuckley and Shrink. But the relative limits of other\nStates cannot be the key factor, for such considerations\nare nothing more than a moving target. After all, if the\nVermont Legislature simply persuaded several other\nStates to lower their contribution limits to parallel Act 64,\nthen the Act, which would still “significantly restrict the\namount of funding available for challengers to run com\npetitive campaigns,” ante, at 19, would survive this aspect\nof the majority’s proposed test.\n   Nor is the relationship of these limits to those in Buck\nley and Shrink a critical fact. In Shrink, the Court specifi\ncally determined that Buckley did not “set a minimum\nconstitutional threshold for contribution limits,” rejecting\nsuch a contention as a “fundamental misunderstanding of\nwhat we held.” 528 U. S., at 396. The plurality’s current\ntreatment of the limits in Shrink as a constitutional\nminimum, or at least as limits below which “danger signs”\nare present, thus cannot be reconciled with Shrink itself.\n   Having nevertheless concluded that these “danger\nsigns” require us to scrutinize the record, the plurality\nembarks on an odd review of the contribution limits, com\nbining unrelated factors to determine that, “taken to\ngether,” ante, at 19, the restrictions of Act 64 are not\nclosely drawn to meet their objectives. Two of these fac\ntors simply cause the already stringent limitations on\nindividual contributions to be more stringent; i.e., volun\n6                        RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nteer services count toward the contribution limit, ante, at\n25–27, and the limits do not change with inflation, so they\nwill become even more stringent in time, ante, at 27.2\nWhile these characteristics confirm the plurality’s impres\nsion that these limits are, indeed, quite low, they have\nnothing whatsoever to do with whether the restrictions\nare closely drawn to meet their objectives. The plurality\nwould presumably uphold a limit on contributions of $1\nmillion, even if volunteer services counted toward that\nlimit and the limit did not change with inflation. Charac\nterizing these facts as shifting Act 64’s limits from “suspi\nciously low” to “too low,” ibid., provides no insight on how\nto draw this constitutional line.\n   The plurality next departs from the general applicability\nof the contribution limits entirely, and notes the substan\ntial interference of the contribution limits with the activi\nties of parties. Again, I do not dispute that the limitation\non party contributions is unconstitutional; as I have previ\nously noted, such limitations are unconstitutional even\nunder Buckley. See Colorado II, supra, at 476–477. But it\nis entirely unclear why the mere fact that the “suspi\nciously low” contribution limits also apply to parties\nshould mean that those limits are in fact “too low” when\nthey are applied to individuals. If the limits impermissi\nbly intrude upon the associational rights of parties, then\nthe limits are unconstitutional as applied to parties. But\n——————\n    2 Ironically,\n               the plurality is troubled by the fact that the absence of a\nprovision adjusting the limits for inflation means that the real value of\nthe limits will decline, and that “the burden of preventing the decline\n[lies] upon incumbent legislators who may not diligently police the need\nfor changes in limit levels to assure the adequate financing of electoral\nchallenges.” Ante, at 27. It is impossible to square this wariness of\nincumbents’ disinclination to enact future laws protecting challengers\nwith the plurality’s deference to those same incumbents when they\nmake empirical judgments regarding “the precise restriction necessary\nto carry out the statute’s legitimate objectives” in the first place.

First, the\nlimits affect a substantial portion of the money given to\nchallengers. But contribution limits always dispropor\ntionately burden challengers, who often have smaller\nbases of support than incumbents. See Smith, 66–70. In\nShrink, the Court expressly rejected the argument that a\nnegative impact on a challenger could render a contribu\ntion limit invalid, relying on the same sort of analysis of\nthe “average effect of contribution limits on fundraising,”\nante, at 21, that the plurality today rejects. See 528 U. S.,\nat 396 (noting that 97.62% of all contributors for state\nauditor made contributions of less than $2,000, and that\n“[e]ven if we were to assume that the contribution limits\naffected respondent[’s] ability to wage a competitive cam\npaign . . . a showing of one affected individual does not\npoint up a system of suppressed political advocacy “that\n——————\n    3 The plurality’s connection of these two factors implies that it is con\n\ncerned not with the impact on the speech of contributors, but solely\nwith the speech of candidates, for whom the two facts might be con\nnected. See ante, at 19. Indeed, the plurality notably omits interference\nwith participation in campaigns through monetary contributions from\nthe list of reasons the Act is unconstitutional. See id., at 19, 27. But\ncontributors, too, have a right to free speech. See Colorado I 518 U. S.\n604, 637 (1996) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in\npart) (“If an individual is limited in the amount of resources he can\ncontribute to the pool, he is most certainly limited in his ability to\nassociate for purposes of effective advocacy”). Even Buckley v. Valeo,\n424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per curiam), recognizes that contribution limits\nrestrict the free speech of contributors, even if it understates the\nsignificance of this restriction. See id., at 20–21 (“[A] limitation upon\nthe amount that any one person or group may contribute to a candidate\n. . . entails only a marginal restriction upon the contributor’s ability to\nengage in free communication”).\n8                   RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nwould be unconstitutional under Buckley”). Cf. id., at 420\n(Thomas, J., dissenting) (“The Court in Buckley provided\nno basis for suppressing the speech of an individual candi\ndate simply because other candidates (or candidates in the\naggregate) may succeed in reaching the voting public . . .\nany such reasoning would fly in the face of the premise of\nour political system—liberty vested in individual hands\nsafeguards the functioning of our democracy”). An indi\nvidual’s First Amendment right is infringed whether his\nspeech is decreased by 5% or 95%, and whether he suffers\nalone or shares his violation with his fellow citizens.\nCertainly, the First Amendment does not authorize us to\njudge whether a restriction of political speech imposes a\nsufficiently severe disadvantage on challengers that a\ncandidate should be able to complain. See Shrink, supra,\nat 427 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (“[C]ourts have no yard\nstick by which to judge the proper amount and effective\nness of campaign speech”).\n   The plurality’s final justification fares no better. Argu\ning that Vermont offers no justification for imposing a\nlimit lower than that imposed in any other State is simply\nanother way of saying that the benchmark for whether a\ncontribution limitation is constitutional is what other\nStates have imposed. As I have noted above, supra, at 6,\ntying individuals’ First Amendment rights to the presence\nor absence of similar laws in other States is inconsistent\nwith the First Amendment.\n   The plurality recognizes that the burdens which lead it\nto invalidate Act 64’s contribution limits are present under\n“many, though not all, campaign finance regulations.”\nAnte, at 28. As a result, the plurality does not purport to\noffer any single touchstone for evaluating the constitu\ntionality of such laws. Indeed, its discussion offers noth\ning resembling a rule at all. From all appearances, the\nplurality simply looked at these limits and said, in its\n“independent judicial judgment,” ante, at 14, that they are\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)             9\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntoo low. The atmospherics—whether they vary with infla\ntion, whether they are as high as those in other States or\nthose in Shrink and Buckley, whether they apply to volun\nteer activities and parties—no doubt help contribute to the\nplurality’s sentiment. But a feeling does not amount to a\nworkable rule of law.\n   This is not to say that the plurality errs in concluding\nthat these limits are too low to satisfy even Buckley’s\nlenient standard. Indeed, it is almost impossible to imag\nine that any legislator would ever find his scruples over\ncome by a $201 donation. See Shrink, supra, at 425\n(Thomas, J., dissenting) (“I cannot fathom how a $251\ncontribution could pose a substantial risk of ‘secur[ing] a\npolitical quid pro quo’ ” (quoting Buckley, 424 U. S., at 26)).\nAnd the statistics relied on by the plurality indeed reveal\nthat substantial resources will be lost by candidates run\nning campaigns under these limits. See ante, at 19–22.\nGiven that these contribution limits severely impinge on\nthe ability of candidates to run campaigns and on the\nability of citizens to contribute to campaigns, and do so\nwithout any demonstrable need to avoid corruption, they\ncannot possibly satisfy even Buckley’s ambiguous level of\nscrutiny.\n   But the plurality’s determination that this statute\nclearly lies on the impermissible side of the constitutional\nline gives no assistance in drawing this line, and it is clear\nthat no such line can be drawn rationally. There is simply\nno way to calculate just how much money a person would\nneed to receive before he would be corrupt or perceived to\nbe corrupt (and such a calculation would undoubtedly vary\nby person). Likewise, there is no meaningful way of dis\ncerning just how many resources must be lost before\nspeech is “disproportionately burden[ed].” Ante, at 28.\nBuckley, as the plurality has applied it, gives us license to\nsimply strike down any limits that just seem to be too\nstringent, and to uphold the rest.

Valeo, 424 U. S. 1\n(1976), forecloses any constitutional limitations on candi\ndate expenditures. This is plainly an issue on which\nreasonable minds can disagree. The Buckley Court never\nexplicitly addressed whether the pernicious effects of\nendless fundraising can serve as a compelling state inter\nest that justifies expenditure limits, post, at 2 (SOUTER, J.,\ndissenting), yet its silence, in light of the record before it,\nsuggests that it implicitly treated this proposed interest\ninsufficient, ante, at 11 (plurality opinion of BREYER, J.).\nAssuming this to be true, however, I am convinced that\nBuckley’s holding on expenditure limits is wrong, and that\n2                   RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthe time has come to overrule it.\n    I have not reached this conclusion lightly. As JUSTICE\nBREYER correctly observes, stare decisis is a principle of\n“ ‘fundamental importance.’ ” Ante, at 9. But it is not an\ninexorable command, and several factors, taken together,\nprovide special justification for revisiting the constitution\nality of statutory limits on candidate expenditures.\n    To begin with, Buckley’s holding on expenditure limits\nitself upset a long-established practice. For the preceding\n65 years, congressional races had been subject to statutory\nlimits on both expenditures and contributions. See 37\nStat. 28; Federal Corrupt Practices Act of 1925, 43 Stat.\n1073; Federal Election Campaign Finance Act of 1971, 86\nStat. 5; Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of\n1974, 88 Stat. 1263; United States v. Automobile Workers,\n352 U. S. 567, 575–576 (1957); McConnell v. Federal Elec\ntion Comm’n, 540 U. S. 93, 115–117 (2003). As the Court of\nAppeals had recognized in Buckley v. Valeo, 519 F. 2d 821,\n859 (CADC 1975) (en banc) (per curiam), our earlier juris\nprudence provided solid support for treating these limits as\npermissible regulations of conduct rather than speech. Ibid.\n(discussing Burroughs v. United States, 290 U. S. 534\n(1934), and United States v. Harriss, 347 U. S. 612 (1954));\nsee also 519 F. 2d, at 841, and n. 41, 851, and n. 68. While\nBuckley’s holding on contribution limits was consistent with\nthis backdrop, its holding on expenditure limits “involve[d]\ncollision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope,\nintrinsically sounder, and verified by experience,” Helvering\nv. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 (1940).\n    There are further reasons for reexamining Buckley’s\nholding on candidate expenditure limits that do not apply\nto its holding on candidate contribution limits. Although\nwe have subsequently reiterated the line Buckley drew\nbetween these two types of limits, we have done so primar\nily in cases affirming the validity of contribution limits or\ntheir functional equivalents. See McConnell, 540 U. S., at\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                     3\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n134–138; Federal Election Comm’n v. Colorado Republican\nFederal Campaign Comm., 533 U. S. 431, 440–442 (2001);\nNixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377,\n386–387 (2000); cf. California Medical Assn. v. Federal\nElection Comm’n, 453 U. S. 182, 194–195 (1981) (plurality\nopinion). In contrast, these are our first post-Buckley cases\nthat raise the constitutionality of expenditure limits on the\namounts that candidates for office may spend on their own\ncampaigns.1\n   Accordingly, while we have explicitly recognized the\nimportance of stare decisis in the context of Buckley’s\nholding on contribution limits, McConnell, 540 U. S., at\n137–138, we have never before done so with regard to its\nrejection of expenditure limits. And McConnell’s recogni\ntion rested largely on an interest specific to Buckley’s\nholding on contribution limits. There, we stated that\n“[c]onsiderations of stare decisis, buttressed by the respect\nthat the Legislative and Judicial Branches owe to one\nanother, provide additional powerful reasons for adhering\nto the analysis of contribution limits that the Court has\nconsistently followed since Buckley was decided.” 540\nU. S., at 137–138 (emphasis added). This powerful but\ntress is absent from Buckley’s refusal to defer to the Legis\nlature’s judgment as to the importance of expenditure\nlimits. Relatedly, while Congress and state legislatures\nhave long relied on Buckley’s authorization of contribution\nlimits, Buckley’s rejection of expenditure limits “has not\ninduced [comparable] detrimental reliance,” Lawrence v.\n——————\n  1 We have, of course, invalidated limits on independent expenditures by\nthird persons. Federal Election Comm’n v. National Conservative Political\nAction Comm., 470 U. S. 480 (1985); Colorado Republican Federal Cam\npaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm’n, 518 U. S. 604 (1996); cf. Federal\nElection Comm’n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238\n(1986). In these cases the principal parties accepted Buckley’s holding on\ncandidate expenditure limits and gave us no cause to consider how much\nweight to give stare decisis.\n4                   RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nTexas, 539 U. S. 558, 577 (2003). See also Vieth v. Jube\nlirer, 541 U. S. 267, 306 (2004) (plurality opinion) (noting\nlessened stare decisis concern where “it is hard to imagine\nhow any action taken in reliance upon [the prior case]\ncould conceivably be frustrated”).\n   Perhaps in partial recognition of these points, Justice\nWhite refused to abandon his opposition to Buckley’s\nholding on expenditure limits.        See Federal Election\nComm’n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S.\n238, 271 (1986); Federal Election Comm’n v. National\nConservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 507–512\n(1985) (dissenting opinion). He believed Buckley deeply\nwrong on this issue because it confused “the identification of\nspeech with its antecedents.” National Conservative Politi\ncal Action Comm., 470 U. S., at 508. Over the course of his\nsteadfast campaign, he converted at least one other Buck\nley participant to this position, see National Conservative\nPolitical Action Comm., 470 U. S., at 518–521 (Marshall,\nJ., dissenting), and his reasoning has since persuaded\nme—the nonparticipating Member of the Buckley Court—\nas well.\n   As Justice White recognized, it is quite wrong to equate\nmoney and speech. Buckley, 424 U. S., at 263 (opinion\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). To the\ncontrary,\n       “The burden on actual speech imposed by limita\n    tions on the spending of money is minimal and indi\n    rect. All rights of direct political expression and advo\n    cacy are retained. Even under the campaign laws as\n    originally enacted, everyone was free to spend as\n    much as they chose to amplify their views on general\n    political issues, just not specific candidates. The re\n    strictions, to the extent they do affect speech, are\n    viewpoint-neutral and indicate no hostility to the\n    speech itself or its effects.” National Conservative Po\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

S., at 508–509 (White, J.,\n    dissenting).\nAccordingly, these limits on expenditures are far more\nakin to time, place, and manner restrictions than to re\nstrictions on the content of speech. Like Justice White, I\nwould uphold them “so long as the purposes they serve are\nlegitimate and sufficiently substantial.” Buckley, 424\nU. S., at 264.\n  Buckley’s conclusion to the contrary relied on the follow\ning oft-quoted metaphor:\n     “Being free to engage in unlimited political expression\n     subject to a ceiling on expenditures is like being free\n     to drive an automobile as far and as often as one de\n     sires on a single tank of gasoline.” Id., at 19, n. 18.\nBut, of course, while a car cannot run without fuel, a\ncandidate can speak without spending money. And while\na car can only travel so many miles per gallon, there is no\nlimit on the number of speeches or interviews a candidate\nmay give on a limited budget. Moreover, provided that\nthis budget is above a certain threshold, a candidate can\nexercise due care to ensure that her message reaches all\nvoters. Just as a driver need not use a Hummer to reach\nher destination, so a candidate need not flood the airways\nwith ceaseless sound-bites of trivial information in order\nto provide voters with reasons to support her.\n   Indeed, the examples of effective speech in the political\narena that did not depend on any significant expenditure\nby the campaigner are legion. It was the content of Wil\nliam Jennings Bryan’s comments on the “Cross of Gold”—\nand William McKinley’s responses delivered from his front\nporch in Canton, Ohio—rather than any expenditure of\nmoney that appealed to their cost-free audiences. Neither\nAbraham Lincoln nor John F. Kennedy paid for the oppor\ntunity to engage in the debates with Stephen Douglas and\nRichard Nixon that may well have determined the out\n6                      RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncomes of Presidential elections. When the seasoned cam\npaigners who were Members of the Congress that en\ndorsed the expenditure limits in the Federal Election\nCampaign Act Amendments of 1974 concluded that a\nmodest budget would not preclude them from effectively\ncommunicating with the electorate, they necessarily re\njected the Buckley metaphor.\n  These campaigners also identified significant govern\nment interests favoring the imposition of expenditure\nlimits. Not only do these limits serve as an important\ncomplement to corruption-reducing contribution limits, see\nid., at 264 (opinion of White, J.), but they also “protect\nequal access to the political arena, [and] free candidates\nand their staffs from the interminable burden of fundrais\ning.” Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v.\nFederal Election Comm’n, 518 U. S. 604, 649–650 (1996)\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting). These last two interests are\nparticularly acute. When campaign costs are so high that\nonly the rich have the reach to throw their hats into the\nring, we fail “to protect the political process from undue\ninfluence of large aggregations of capital and to promote\nindividual responsibility for democratic government.”\nAutomobile Workers, 352 U. S., at 590. States have recog\nnized this problem,2 but Buckley’s perceived ban on expendi\nture limits severely limits their options in dealing with it.\n  The interest in freeing candidates from the fundraising\nstraitjacket is even more compelling. Without expenditure\nlimits, fundraising devours the time and attention of\npolitical leaders, leaving them too busy to handle their\npublic responsibilities effectively. That fact was well\nrecognized by backers of the legislation reviewed in Buck\nley, by the Court of Appeals judges who voted to uphold\n——————\n  2 See Brief for State of Connecticut et al. as Amici Curiae 16–17 (cit\n\ning Ariz.

Neither the opinions in\nBuckley nor those that form today’s cacophony pay heed to\nhow the Framers would have viewed candidate expendi\nture limits. This is not an unprincipled approach, as the\nhistorical context is “usually relevant but not necessarily\ndispositive.” Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. ___, ___\n(2006) (slip op., at 1) (STEVENS, J., concurring). This is\nparticularly true of contexts that are so different. At the\ntime of the framing the accepted posture of the leading\ncandidates was one of modesty, acknowledging a willingness\nto serve rather than a desire to compete. Speculation about\nhow the Framers would have legislated if they had foreseen\nthe era of televised sound-bites thus cannot provide us with\ndefinitive answers.\n  Nevertheless, I am firmly persuaded that the Framers\nwould have been appalled by the impact of modern fund-\nraising practices on the ability of elected officials to per\nform their public responsibilities. I think they would have\nviewed federal statutes limiting the amount of money that\ncongressional candidates might spend in future elections\n——————\nreelection.” 217 F. Supp. 2d, at 1200 (citation omitted). The court\nfurther concluded that the “system of unlimited spending has deleteri\nous effects on the competitiveness of elections because it gives incum\nbent candidates an electoral advantage.” Ibid. While far from conclu\nsive, this example cuts against the view that there is a slam-dunk\ncorrelation between expenditure limits and incumbent advantage. See\nalso Brief for Center for Democracy and Election Management at\nAmerican University as Amicus Curiae (concluding that Canada, the\nUnited Kingdom, New Zealand, and Malta—all of which have campaign\nexpenditure limits—have more electoral competition than the United\nStates, Jamaica, Ireland, and Australia—all of which lack such limits).\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

S. 1 (1976) (per curiam),\nante, at 8–11 (opinion of BREYER, J.), is at least premature.\n  We said in Buckley that “expenditure limitations impose\nfar greater restraints on the freedom of speech and asso\nciation than do . . . contribution limitations,” 424 U. S., at\n44, but the Buckley Court did not categorically foreclose\nthe possibility that some spending limit might comport\nwith the First Amendment. Instead, Buckley held that the\nconstitutionality of an expenditure limitation “turns on\nwhether the governmental interests advanced in its sup\nport satisfy the [applicable] exacting scrutiny.” Ibid. In\napplying that standard in Buckley itself, the Court gave no\nindication that it had given serious consideration to an\naim that Vermont’s statute now pursues: to alleviate the\ndrain on candidates’ and officials’ time caused by the\nendless fundraising necessary to aggregate many small\ncontributions to meet the opportunities for ever more\nexpensive campaigning. Instead, we dwelt on rejecting\nthe sufficiency of interests in reducing corruption, equaliz\ning the financial resources of candidates, and capping the\noverall cost of political campaigns, see id., at 55–57. Al\nthough Justice White went a step further in dissenting\nfrom the Court on expenditures, and made something of\nthe interest in getting officials off the “treadmill” driven by\nthe “obsession with fundraising,” see id., at 265 (opinion\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part), this lurking\nissue was not treated as significant on the expenditure\nquestion in the per curiam opinion. Whatever the obser\nvations made to the Buckley Court about the effect of\nfundraising on candidates’ time, the Court did not\nsquarely address a time-protection interest as support for\nthe expenditure limits, much less one buttressed by as\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

Vermont’s claim is serious. Three decades of\nexperience since Buckley have taught us much, and the\nfindings made by the Vermont Legislature on the perni\ncious effect of the nonstop pursuit of money are signifi\ncant. See, e.g., Act 64, H. 28, Legislative Findings and\nIntent, at App. 20 (finding that “candidates for statewide\noffices are spending inordinate amounts of time raising\ncampaign funds”); ibid. (finding that “[r]obust debate of\nissues, candidate interaction with the electorate, and\npublic involvement and confidence in the electoral process\nhave decreased as campaign expenditures have in\ncreased”); see also Landell v. Sorrell, 118 F. Supp. 2d 459,\n467 (Vt. 2000) (noting testimony of Senator Shumlin\nbefore the legislature that raising funds “was one of the\nmost distasteful things that I’ve had to do in public ser\nvice” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Landell v.\nSorrell, 382 F. 3d 91, 123 (CA2 2004) (public officials\ntestified at trial that “elected officials spend time with\ndonors rather than on their official duties”).\n   The legislature’s findings are surely significant enough\nto justify the Court of Appeals’s remand to the District\n——————\n   * In approving the public funding provisions of the subject campaign\nfinance law, Subtitle H of the Internal Revenue Code, the Buckley\nCourt appreciated that in enacting the provision Congress was legislat\ning in part “to free candidates from the rigors of fundraising,” 424 U. S.,\nat 91; see also id., at 96 (“Congress properly regarded public financing\nas an appropriate means of relieving major-party Presidential candi\ndates from the rigors of soliciting private contributions”). Recognition\nof the interest as to Subtitle H, a question of congressional power\ninvolving a different evidentiary burden, see South Dakota v. Dole, 483\nU. S. 203, 207 (1987); see also Buckley, supra, at 90, does not imply a\nconclusive rejection of it as to the separate issue of expenditure limits.\n4                   RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nCourt to decide whether Vermont’s spending limits are the\nleast restrictive means of accomplishing what the court\nunexceptionably found to be worthy objectives. See id., at\n124–125, 135–137. The District Court was instructed to\nexamine a variety of outstanding issues, including alter\nnatives considered by Vermont’s Legislature and the\nreasons for rejecting them. See id., at 136. Thus, the\nconstitutionality of the expenditure limits was not conclu\nsively decided by the Second Circuit, and I believe the\nevidentiary work that remained to be done would have\nraised the prospect for a sound answer to that question,\nwhatever the answer might have been. Instead, we are\nleft with an unresolved question of narrow tailoring and\nwith consequent doubt about the justifiability of the\nspending limits as necessary and appropriate correctives.\nThis is not the record on which to foreclose the ability of a\nState to remedy the impact of the money chase on the\ndemocratic process. I would not, therefore, disturb the\nCourt of Appeals’s stated intention to remand.\n                               II\n   Although I would defer judgment on the merits of the\nexpenditure limitations, I believe the Court of Appeals\ncorrectly rejected the challenge to the contribution limits.\nLow though they are, one cannot say that “the contribu\ntion limitation[s are] so radical in effect as to render po\nlitical association ineffective, drive the sound of a candi\ndate’s voice below the level of notice, and render\ncontributions pointless.” Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Gov\nernment PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 397 (2000).\n   The limits set by Vermont are not remarkable depar\ntures either from those previously upheld by this Court or\nfrom those lately adopted by other States. The plurality\nconcedes that on a per-citizen measurement Vermont’s\nlimit for statewide elections “is slightly more generous,”\nante, at 18, than the one set by the Missouri statute ap\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

Not only do those\ndollar amounts get more generous the smaller the district,\nthey are consistent with limits set by the legislatures of\nmany other States, all of them with populations larger than\nVermont’s, some significantly so. See, e.g., Montana Right\nto Life Assn. v. Eddleman, 343 F. 3d 1085, 1088 (CA9 2003)\n(approving $400 limit for candidates filed jointly for Gover\nnor and Lieutenant Governor, since increased to $500, see\nMont. Code Ann. §13–37–216(1)(a)(i) (2005)); Daggett v.\nCommission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices,\n205 F. 3d 445, 452 (CA1 2000) ($500 limit for gubernatorial\ncandidates in Maine); Minnesota Citizens Concerned for\nLife, Inc. v. Kelley, 427 F. 3d 1106, 1113 (CA8 2005) ($500\nlimit on contributions to legislative candidates in election\nyears, $100 in other years); Florida Right to Life, Inc. v.\nMortham, No. 6:98–770–CV, 2000 WL 33733256, *3 (MD\nFla., Mar. 20, 2000) ($500 limit on contributions to any state\ncandidate). The point is not that this Court is bound by\njudicial sanctions of those numbers; it is that the consis\ntency in legislative judgment tells us that Vermont is not an\neccentric party of one, and that this is a case for the judicial\ndeference that our own precedents say we owe here. See\nShrink, supra, at 402 (BREYER, J., concurring) (“Where a\nlegislature has significantly greater institutional expertise,\nas, for example, in the field of election regulation, the Court\nin practice defers to empirical legislative judgments”); see\nalso ante, at 14 (plurality opinion) (“[O]rdinarily we have\ndeferred to the legislature’s determination of [matters re\nlated to the costs and nature of running for office]”).\n   To place Vermont’s contribution limits beyond the con\nstitutional pale, therefore, is to forget not only the facts of\nShrink, but also our self-admonition against second-\nguessing legislative judgments about the risk of corruption\nto which contribution limits have to be fitted. See Shrink,\nsupra, at 391, and n. 5. And deference here would surely\nnot be overly complaisant. Vermont’s legislators them\n6                   RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nselves testified at length about the money that gets their\nspecial attention, see Act 64, H. 28, Legislative Findings\nand Intent, at App. 20 (finding that “[s]ome candidates\nand elected officials, particularly when time is limited,\nrespond and give access to contributors who make large\ncontributions in preference to those who make small or no\ncontributions”); 382 F. 3d, at 122 (testimony of Elizabeth\nReady: “If I have only got an hour at night when I get\nhome to return calls, I am much more likely to return [a\ndonor’s] call than I would [a non-donor’s] . . . . [W]hen you\nonly have a few minutes to talk, there are certain people\nthat get access” (alterations in original)). The record\nrevealed the amount of money the public sees as suspi\nciously large, see 118 F. Supp. 2d, at 479–480 (“The limits\nset by the legislature . . . accurately reflect the level of\ncontribution considered suspiciously large by the Vermont\npublic. Testimony suggested that amounts greater than\nthe contribution limits are considered large by the Ver\nmont public”). And testimony identified the amounts high\nenough to pay for effective campaigning in a State where\nthe cost of running tends to be on the low side, see id., at\n471 (“In the context of Vermont politics, $200, $300, and\n$400 donations are clearly large, as the legislature deter\nmined. Small donations are considered to be strong acts of\npolitical support in this state.

The majority of major party candidates for\nstatewide office in the last three election cycles spent less\nthan what the spending limits of Act 64 would allow. . . .\nIn Vermont legislative races, low-cost methods such as\ndoor-to-door campaigning are standard and even expected\nby the voters”).\n   Still, our cases do not say deference should be absolute.\nWe can all imagine dollar limits that would be laughable,\nand per capita comparisons that would be meaningless\nbecause aggregated donations simply could not sustain\neffective campaigns. The plurality thinks that point has\nbeen reached in Vermont, and in particular that the low\ncontribution limits threaten the ability of challengers to\nrun effective races against incumbents. Thus, the plural\nity’s limit of deference is substantially a function of suspi\ncion that political incumbents in the legislature set low\ncontribution limits because their public recognition and\neasy access to free publicity will effectively augment their\nown spending power beyond anything a challenger can\nmuster. The suspicion is, in other words, that incumbents\ncannot be trusted to set fair limits, because facially neu\ntral limits do not in fact give challengers an even break.\nBut this received suspicion is itself a proper subject of\nsuspicion. The petitioners offered, and the plurality in\nvokes, no evidence that the risk of a pro-incumbent advan\ntage has been realized; in fact, the record evidence runs\nthe other way, as the plurality concedes. See ante, at 22\n(“the record does contain some anecdotal evidence support\ning the respondents’ position, namely, testimony about a\npost-Act-64 competitive mayoral campaign in Burlington,\nwhich suggests that a challenger can ‘amas[s] the re\nsources necessary for effective advocacy,’ Buckley, 424\nU. S., at 21”). I would not discount such evidence that\n8                  RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nthese low limits are fair to challengers, for the experience\nof the Burlington race is confirmed by recent empirical\nstudies addressing this issue of incumbent’s advantage.\nSee, e.g., Eom & Gross, Contribution Limits and Disparity\nin Contributions Between Gubernatorial Candidates, 59\nPol. Research Q. 99, 99 (2006) (“Analyses of both the\nnumber of contributors and the dollar amount of contribu\ntions [to gubernatorial candidates] suggest no support for\nan increased bias in favor of incumbents resulting from\nthe presence of campaign contribution limits. If anything,\ncontribution limits can work to reduce the bias that tradi\ntionally works in favor of incumbents. Also, contribution\nlimits do not seem to increase disparities between guber\nnatorial candidates in general” (emphasis deleted)); Bard-\nwell, Money and Challenger Emergence in Gubernatorial\nPrimaries, 55 Pol. Research Q. 653 (2002) (finding that\ncontribution limits favor neither incumbents nor challeng\ners); Hogan, The Costs of Representation in State Legisla\ntures: Explaining Variations in Campaign Spending, 81\nSoc. Sci. Q. 941, 952 (2000) (finding that contribution\nlimits reduce incumbent spending but have no effect on\nchallenger or open-seat candidate spending). The Legisla\nture of Vermont evidently tried to account for the realities\nof campaigning in Vermont, and I see no evidence of con\nstitutional miscalculation sufficient to dispense with\nrespect for its judgments.\n                             III\n  Four issues of detail call for some attention, the first\nbeing the requirement that a volunteer’s expenses count\nagainst the person’s contribution limit. The plurality\ncertainly makes out the case that accounting for these\nexpenses will be a colossal nuisance, but there is no case\nhere that the nuisance will noticeably limit volunteering,\nor that volunteers whose expenses reach the limit cannot\ncontinue with their efforts subject to charging their candi\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)             9\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\ndates for the excess. Granted, if the provisions for contri\nbution limits were teetering on the edge of unconstitution\nality, Act 64’s treatment of volunteers’ expenses might be\nthe finger-flick that gives the fatal push, but it has no\ngreater significance than that.\n   Second, the failure of the Vermont law to index its limits\nfor inflation is even less important. This challenge is to\nthe law as it is, not to a law that may have a different\nimpact after future inflation if the state legislature fails to\nbring it up to economic date.\n   Third, subjecting political parties to the same contribu\ntion limits as individuals does not condemn the Vermont\nscheme. What we said in Federal Election Comm’n v.\nColorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., 533 U. S.\n431, 454–455 (2001), dealing with regulation of coordi\nnated expenditures, goes here, too. The capacity and\ndesire of parties to make large contributions to competi\ntive candidates with uphill fights are shared by rich indi\nviduals, and the risk that large party contributions would\nbe channels to evade individual limits cannot be elimi\nnated. Nor are these reasons to support the party limits\nundercut by claims that the restrictions render parties\nimpotent, for the parties are not precluded from uncoordi\nnated spending to benefit their candidates. That said, I\nacknowledge the suggestions in the petitioners’ briefs that\nsuch restrictions in synergy with other influences weaken\ning party power would justify a wholesale reexamination\nof the situation of party organization today. But whether\nsuch a comprehensive reexamination belongs in courts or\nonly in legislatures is not an issue presented by these\ncases.\n   Finally, there is the issue of Act 64’s presumption of\ncoordinated expenditures on the part of political parties,\nVt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17, §2809(d) (2002). The plurality has\nno occasion to reach it; I do reach it, but find it insignifi\ncant. The Republican Party petitioners complain that the\n10                   RANDALL v. SORRELL\n\n                      SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nrelated expenditure provision imposes on both the candi\ndate and the party the burden in some circumstances to\nprove that coordination of expenditure did not take place,\nthus threatening to charge against a candidate’s spending\nlimits some party expenditures that are in fact independ\nent, with an ultimate consequence of chilling speech. See\nBrief for Respondent/Cross-Petitioner Vermont Republi\ncan State Committee et al. 45–46. On the contrary, how\never, we can safely take the presumption on the represen\ntation to this Court by the Attorney General of Vermont:\nthe law imposes not a burden of persuasion but merely one\nof production, leaving the presumption easily rebuttable.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 39–41 (representation that the pre\nsumption disappears once credible evidence, such as an\naffidavit, is offered); see also Brief for Respondent/Cross-\nPetitioner William H. Sorrell et al. 48 (the presumption\n“contributes no evidence and disappears when facts ap\npear. In a case covered by the presumption, a political\nparty need only present some evidence that the presumed\nfact is not true and the presumption vanishes. . . . Simple\ntestimony that the expenditure was not coordinated would\nsuffice to defeat the presumption” (citations, internal\nquotation marks, and alterations omitted)). As so under\nstood, the rebuttable presumption clearly imposes no\nonerous burden like the conclusive presumption in Colo\nrado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal\nElection Comm’n, 518 U.
