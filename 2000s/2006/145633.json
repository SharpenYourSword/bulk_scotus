His family hired attorney John Fahle to represent him. After the arraignment, respondent called a California attorney, Joseph Low, to discuss whether Low would represent him, either in addition to or instead of Fahle. Low flew from California to meet with respondent, who hired him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Some time later, Low and Fahle represented respondent at an evidentiary hearing before a Magistrate Judge. The Magistrate Judge accepted Low's provisional entry of appearance and permitted Low to participate in the hear- ing on the condition that he immediately file a motion for admission <i>pro hac vice</i>. During the hearing, however, the Magistrate Judge revoked the provisional acceptance on the ground that, by passing notes to Fahle, Low had vio- lated a court rule restricting the cross-examination of a witness to one counsel.</blockquote>\n<p>The following week, respondent informed Fahle that he wanted Low to be his only attorney. Low then filed an application for admission <i>pro hac vice</i>. The District Court denied his application without comment. A month later, Low filed a second application, which the District Court again denied without explanation. Low's appeal, in the form of an application for a writ of mandamus, was dis- missed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</p>\n<p>Fahle filed a motion to withdraw as counsel and for a show-cause hearing to consider sanctions against Low. Fahle asserted that, by contacting respondent while re- spondent was represented by Fahle, Low violated Mo. Rule of Professional Conduct 4-4.2 (1993), which prohibits a lawyer \"[i]n representing a client\" from \"communi- cat[ing] about the subject of the representation with a party . . . represented by another lawyer\" without that lawyer's consent. Low filed a motion to strike Fahle's motion. The District Court granted Fahle's motion to withdraw and granted a continuance so that respondent could find new representation. Respondent retained a local attorney, Karl Dickhaus, for the trial. The District Court then denied Low's motion to strike and, for the first time, explained that it had denied Low's motions for ad- mission <i>pro hac vice</i> primarily because, in a separate case before it, Low had violated Rule 4-4.2 by communicating with a represented party.</p>\n<p>The case proceeded to trial, and Dickhaus represented respondent. Low again moved for admission and was again denied. The Court also denied Dickhaus's request to have Low at counsel table with him and ordered Low to sit in the audience and to have no contact with Dickhaus during the proceedings. To enforce the Court's order, a United States Marshal sat between Low and Dickhaus at trial. Respondent was unable to meet with Low through- out the trial, except for once on the last night. The jury found respondent guilty.</p>\n<p>After trial, the District Court granted Fahle's motion for sanctions against Low. It read Rule 4-4.2 to forbid Low's contact with respondent without Fahle's permission. It also reiterated that it had denied Low's motions for admis- sion on the ground that Low had violated the same Rule in a separate matter.</p>\n<p>Respondent appealed, and the Eighth Circuit vacated the conviction. 399 F. 3d 924 (2005). The Court first held that the District Court erred in interpreting Rule 4-4.2 to prohibit Low's conduct both in this case and in the sepa- rate matter on which the District Court based its denials of his admission motions. The District Court's denials of these motions were therefore erroneous and violated respondent's Sixth Amendment right to paid counsel of his choosing. See <i>id.</i>, at 928-932. The Court then concluded that this Sixth Amendment violation was not subject to harmless-error review. See <i>id.</i>, at 932-935. We granted certiorari. 546 U. S. ___ (2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The Sixth Amendment provides that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\" We have previ- ously held that an element of this right is the right of a defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him. See <i>Wheat</i> v. <i>United</i> <i>States,</i> 486 U. S. 153, 159 (1988). Cf. <i>Powell</i> v. <i>Alabama,</i> 287 U. S. 45, 53 (1932) (\"It is hardly necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afforded a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice\"). The Government here agrees, as it has previously, that \"the Sixth Amendment guarantees the defendant the right to be represented by an otherwise qualified attorney whom that defendant can afford to hire, or who is willing to represent the defendant even though he is without funds.\" <i>Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chartered</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 491 U. S. 617, 624-625 (1989). To be sure, the right to counsel of choice \"is circumscribed in several important respects.\" <i>Wheat</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 159. But the Government does not dispute the Eighth Circuit's conclusion in this case that the District Court erroneously deprived respondent of his counsel of choice.</p>\n<p>The Government contends, however, that the Sixth Amendment violation is not \"complete\" unless the defen- dant can show that substitute counsel was ineffective within the meaning of <i>Strickland</i> v. <i>Washington,</i> 466 U. S. 668, 691-696 (1984)\u0097<i>i.e.</i>, that substitute counsel's per- formance was deficient and the defendant was prejudiced by it. In the alternative, the Government contends that the defendant must at least demonstrate that his counsel of choice would have pursued a different strategy that would have created a \"reasonable probability that . . . the result of the proceedings would have been different,\" <i>id.</i>, at 694\u0097in other words, that he was prejudiced within the meaning of <i>Strickland</i> by the denial of his counsel of choice even if substitute counsel's performance was not constitutionally deficient.<sup>[1]</sup> To support these propositions, the Government points to our prior cases, which note that the right to counsel \"has been accorded . . . not for its own sake, but for the effect it has on the ability of the accused to receive a fair trial.\" <i>Mickens</i> v. <i>Taylor,</i> 535 U. S. 162, 166 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). A trial is not unfair and thus the Sixth Amendment is not violated, the Government reasons, unless a defendant has been prejudiced.</p>\n<p>Stated as broadly as this, the Government's argument in effect reads the Sixth Amendment as a more detailed version of the Due Process Clause\u0097and then proceeds to give no effect to the details. It is true enough that the purpose of the rights set forth in that Amendment is to ensure a fair trial; but it does not follow that the rights can be disregarded so long as the trial is, on the whole, fair. What the Government urges upon us here is what was urged upon us (successfully, at one time, see <i>Ohio</i> v. <i>Roberts</i>, 448 U. S. 56 (1980)) with regard to the Sixth Amendment's right of confrontation\u0097a line of reasoning that \"abstracts from the right to its purposes, and then eliminates the right.\" <i>Maryland</i> v. <i>Craig,</i> 497 U. S. 836, 862 (1990) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Since, it was argued, the purpose of the Confrontation Clause was to ensure the reliability of evidence, so long as the testimonial hearsay bore \"indicia of reliability,\" the Confrontation Clause was not violated. See <i>Roberts, supra,</i> at 65-66. We rejected that argument (and our prior cases that had accepted it) in <i>Crawford</i> v. <i>Washington</i>, 541 U. S. 36 (2004), saying that the Confrontation Clause \"commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 61.</p>\n<p>So also with the Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice. It commands, not that a trial be fair, but that a particular guarantee of fairness be provided\u0097to wit, that the accused be defended by the counsel he believes to be best. \"The Constitution guarantees a fair trial through the Due Process Clauses, but it defines the basic elements of a fair trial largely through the several provisions of the Sixth Amendment, including the Counsel Clause.\" <i>Strick-</i> <i>land, supra,</i> at 684-685. In sum, the right at stake here is the right to counsel of choice, not the right to a fair trial; and that right was violated because the deprivation of counsel was erroneous. No additional showing of preju- dice is required to make the violation \"complete.\"<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The cases the Government relies on involve the right to the effective assistance of counsel, the violation of which generally requires a defendant to establish prejudice. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Strickland, supra,</i> at 694; <i>Mickens</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 166; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Cronic</i>, 466 U. S. 648 (1984). The earliest case generally cited for the proposition that \"the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel,\" <i>McMann</i> v. <i>Richardson</i>, 397 U. S. 759, 771, n. 14 (1970), was based on the Due Process Clause rather than on the Sixth Amendment, see <i>Powell,</i> 287 U. S., at 57 (cited in <i>e.g., </i><i>McMann, supra,</i> at 771, n. 14). And even our recogni- tion of the right to effective counsel within the Sixth Amendment was a consequence of our perception that representation by counsel \"is critical to the ability of the adversarial system to produce just results.\" <i>Strickland</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 685. Having derived the right to effective repre- sentation from the purpose of ensuring a fair trial, we have, logically enough, also derived the limits of that right from that same purpose. See <i>Mickens, supra,</i> at 166. The requirement that a defendant show prejudice in effective representation cases arises from the very nature of the specific element of the right to counsel at issue there\u0097 <i>effective</i> (not mistake-free) representation. Counsel cannot be \"ineffective\" unless his mistakes have harmed the defense (or, at least, unless it is reasonably likely that they have). Thus, a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to <i>effective</i> representation is not \"complete\" until the defendant is prejudiced. See <i>Strickland</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 685.</p>\n<p>The right to select counsel of one's choice, by contrast, has never been derived from the Sixth Amendment's purpose of ensuring a fair trial.<sup>[3]</sup> It has been regarded as the root meaning of the constitutional guarantee. See <i>Wheat,</i> 486 U. S., at 159; <i>Andersen</i> v. <i>Treat</i>, 172 U. S. 24 (1898). See generally W. Beaney, The Right to Counsel in American Courts 18-24, 27-33 (1955). Cf. <i>Powell</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 53. Where the right to be assisted by counsel of one's choice is wrongly denied, therefore, it is unnecessary to conduct an ineffectiveness or prejudice inquiry to establish a Sixth Amendment violation. Deprivation of the right is \"complete\" when the defendant is erroneously prevented from being represented by the lawyer he wants, regardless of the quality of the representation he received. To argue otherwise is to confuse the right to counsel of choice\u0097 which is the right to a particular lawyer regardless of comparative effectiveness\u0097with the right to effective counsel\u0097which imposes a baseline requirement of compe- tence on whatever lawyer is chosen or appointed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Having concluded, in light of the Government's conces- sion of erroneous deprivation, that the trial court violated respondent's Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice, we must consider whether this error is subject to review for harmlessness. In <i>Arizona</i> v. <i>Fulminante</i>, 499 U. S. 279 (1991), we divided constitutional errors into two classes. The first we called \"trial error,\" because the errors \"oc- curred during presentation of the case to the jury\" and their effect may \"be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether [they were] harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Id.</i>, at 307-308 (internal quotation marks omitted). These in- clude \"most constitutional errors.\" <i>Id.</i>, at 306. The second class of constitutional error we called \"structural defects.\" These \"defy analysis by 'harmless-error' standards\" be- cause they \"affec[t] the framework within which the trial proceeds,\" and are not \"simply an error in the trial process itself.\" <i>Id.</i>, at 309-310.<sup>[4]</sup> See also <i>Neder</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 527 U. S. 1, 7-9 (1999). Such errors include the denial of counsel, see <i>Gideon</i> v. <i>Wainwright,</i> 372 U. S. 335 (1963), the denial of the right of self-representation, see <i>McKaskle</i> v. <i>Wiggins</i>, 465 U. S. 168, 177-178, n. 8 (1984), the denial of the right to public trial, see <i>Waller</i> v. <i>Georgia,</i> 467 U. S. 39, 49, n. 9 (1984), and the denial of the right to trial by jury by the giving of a defective reasonable-doubt instruction, see <i>Sullivan</i> v. <i>Louisiana,</i> 508 U. S. 275 (1993).</p>\n<p>We have little trouble concluding that erroneous depri- vation of the right to counsel of choice, \"with consequences that are necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate, unquestionably qualifies as 'structural error.'\" <i>Id.</i>, at 282. Different attorneys will pursue different strategies with regard to investigation and discovery, development of the theory of defense, selection of the jury, presentation of the witnesses, and style of witness examination and jury argument. And the choice of attorney will affect whether and on what terms the defendant cooperates with the prosecution, plea bargains, or decides instead to go to trial. In light of these myriad aspects of representation, the erroneous denial of counsel bears directly on the \"frame- work within which the trial proceeds,\" <i>Fulminante</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 310\u0097or indeed on whether it proceeds at all. It is impossible to know what different choices the rejected counsel would have made, and then to quantify the impact of those different choices on the outcome of the proceed- ings. Many counseled decisions, including those involving plea bargains and cooperation with the government, do not even concern the conduct of the trial at all. Harmless- error analysis in such a context would be a speculative inquiry into what might have occurred in an alternate universe.</p>\n<p>The Government acknowledges that the deprivation of choice of counsel pervades the entire trial, but points out that counsel's ineffectiveness may also do so and yet we do not allow reversal of a conviction for that reason without a showing of prejudice. But the requirement of showing prejudice in ineffectiveness claims stems from the very definition of the right at issue; it is not a matter of show- ing that the violation was harmless, but of showing that a violation of the right to effective representation <i>occurred</i>. A choice-of-counsel violation occurs <i>whenever</i> the defen- dant's choice is wrongfully denied. Moreover, if and when counsel's ineffectiveness \"pervades\" a trial, it does so (to the extent we can detect it) through identifiable mistakes. We can assess how those mistakes affected the outcome. To determine the effect of wrongful denial of choice of counsel, however, we would not be looking for mistakes committed by the actual counsel, but for differences in the defense that would have been made by the rejected coun- sel\u0097in matters ranging from questions asked on <i>voir dire</i> and cross-examination to such intangibles as argument style and relationship with the prosecutors. We would have to speculate upon what matters the rejected counsel would have handled differently\u0097or indeed, would have handled the same but with the benefit of a more jury- pleasing courtroom style or a longstanding relationship of trust with the prosecutors. And then we would have to speculate upon what effect those different choices or dif- ferent intangibles might have had. The difficulties of conducting the two assessments of prejudice are not re- motely comparable.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Nothing we have said today casts any doubt or places any qualification upon our previous holdings that limit the right to counsel of choice and recognize the authority of trial courts to establish criteria for admitting lawyers to argue before them. As the dissent too discusses, <i>post,</i> at 3, the right to counsel of choice does not extend to defendants who require counsel to be appointed for them. See <i>Wheat,</i> 486 U. S., at 159; <i>Caplin &amp; Drysdale</i>, 491 U. S., at 624, 626. Nor may a defendant insist on representation by a person who is not a member of the bar, or demand that a court honor his waiver of conflict-free representation. See <i>Wheat</i>, 486 U. S., at 159-160. We have recognized a trial court's wide latitude in balancing the right to counsel of choice against the needs of fairness, <i>id.</i>, at 163-164, and against the demands of its calendar, <i>Morris</i> v. <i>Slappy</i>, 461 U. S. 1, 11-12 (1983). The court has, moreover, an \"inde- pendent interest in ensuring that criminal trials are con- ducted within the ethical standards of the profession and that legal proceedings appear fair to all who observe them.\" <i>Wheat</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 160. None of these limitations on the right to choose one's counsel is relevant here. This is not a case about a court's power to enforce rules or adhere to practices that determine which attorneys may appear before it, or to make scheduling and other decisions that effectively exclude a defendant's first choice of counsel. However broad a court's discretion may be, the Govern- ment has conceded that the District Court here erred when it denied respondent his choice of counsel. Accept- ing that premise, we hold that the error violated respon- dent's Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice and that this violation is not subject to harmless-error analysis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE KENNEDY, and JUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I disagree with the Court's conclusion that a criminal conviction must automatically be reversed whenever a trial court errs in applying its rules regarding <i>pro hac vice</i> admissions and as a result prevents a defendant from being represented at trial by the defendant's first-choice attorney. Instead, a defendant should be required to make at least <i>some</i> showing that the trial court's erroneous ruling adversely affected the quality of assistance that the defendant received. In my view, the majority's contrary holding is based on an incorrect interpretation of the Sixth Amendment and a misapplication of harmless-error prin- ciples. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The majority makes a subtle but important mistake at the outset in its characterization of what the Sixth Amendment guarantees. The majority states that the Sixth Amendment protects \"the right of a defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him.\" <i>Ante</i>, at 3. What the Sixth Amendment actually protects, however, is the right to have <i>the assis-</i> <i>tance</i> that the defendant's counsel of choice is able to provide. It follows that if the erroneous disqualification of a defendant's counsel of choice does not impair the assis- tance that a defendant receives at trial, there is no viola- tion of the Sixth Amendment.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The language of the Sixth Amendment supports this interpretation. The Assistance of Counsel Clause focuses on what a defendant is entitled to receive (\"Assistance\"), rather than on the identity of the provider. The back- ground of the adoption of the Sixth Amendment points in the same direction. The specific evil against which the Assistance of Counsel Clause was aimed was the English common-law rule severely limiting a felony defendant's ability to be assisted by counsel. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Ash</i>, 413 U. S. 300, 306 (1973). \"[T]he core purpose of the counsel guarantee was to assure 'Assistance' at trial,\" <i>id.</i>, at 309, and thereby \"to assure fairness in the adversary criminal process,\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morrison</i>, 449 U. S. 361, 364 (1981). It was not \"the essential aim of the Amendment. . . to ensure that a defendant will inexorably be repre- sented by the lawyer whom he prefers.\" <i>Wheat</i> v. <i>United</i> <i>States</i>, 486 U. S. 153, 159 (1988); cf. <i>Morris</i> v. <i>Slappy</i>, 461 U. S. 1, 14 (1983) (\"[W]e reject the claim that the Sixth Amendment guarantees a 'meaningful relationship' be- tween an accused and his counsel\").</p>\n<p>There is no doubt, of course, that the right \"to have the Assistance of Counsel\" carries with it a limited right to be represented by counsel of choice. At the time of the adop- tion of the Bill of Rights, when the availability of ap- pointed counsel was generally limited,<sup>[2]</sup> that is how the right inevitably played out: A defendant's right to have the assistance of counsel necessarily meant the right to have the assistance of whatever counsel the defendant was able to secure. But from the beginning, the right to counsel of choice has been circumscribed.</p>\n<p>For one thing, a defendant's choice of counsel has al- ways been restricted by the rules governing admission to practice before the court in question. The Judiciary Act of 1789 made this clear, providing that parties \"in all the courts of the United States\" had the right to \"the assis- tance of such counsel or attorneys at law as by the rules of the said courts respectively shall be permitted to manage and conduct cases therein.\" Ch. 20, \u00a735, 1 Stat. 92. Therefore, if a defendant's first-choice attorney was not eligible to appear under the rules of a particular court, the defendant had no right to be represented by that attorney. Indeed, if a defendant's top 10 or top 25 choices were all attorneys who were not eligible to appear in the court in question, the defendant had no right to be represented by any of them. Today, rules governing admission to practice before particular courts continue to limit the ability of a criminal defendant to be represented by counsel of choice. See <i>Wheat,</i> 486 U. S., at 159.</p>\n<p>The right to counsel of choice is also limited by conflict- of-interest rules. Even if a defendant is aware that his or her attorney of choice has a conflict, and even if the defen- dant is eager to waive any objection, the defendant has no constitutional right to be represented by that attorney. See <i>id.</i>, at 159-160.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the right to be represented by counsel of choice can be limited by mundane case-management considerations. If a trial judge schedules a trial to begin on a particular date and defendant's counsel of choice is already committed for other trials until some time thereaf- ter, the trial judge has discretion under appropriate cir- cumstances to refuse to postpone the trial date and thereby, in effect, to force the defendant to forgo counsel of choice. See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Slappy</i>, <i>supra</i><i>; </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>Hughey</i>, 147 F. 3d 423, 428-431 (CA5 1998).</p>\n<p>These limitations on the right to counsel of choice are tolerable because the focus of the right is the quality of the representation that the defendant receives, not the iden- tity of the attorney who provides the representation. Limiting a defendant to those attorneys who are willing, available, and eligible to represent the defendant still leaves a defendant with a pool of attorneys to choose from\u0097and, in most jurisdictions today, a large and diverse pool. Thus, these restrictions generally have no adverse effect on a defendant's ability to secure the best assistance that the defendant's circumstances permit.</p>\n<p>Because the Sixth Amendment focuses on the quality of the assistance that counsel of choice would have provided, I would hold that the erroneous disqualification of counsel does not violate the Sixth Amendment unless the ruling diminishes the quality of assistance that the defendant would have otherwise received. This would not require a defendant to show that the second-choice attorney was constitutionally ineffective within the meaning of <i>Strick-</i> <i>land</i> v. <i>Washington</i>, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Rather, the defendant would be entitled to a new trial if the defendant could show \"an identifiable difference in the quality of representation between the disqualified counsel and the attorney who represents the defendant at trial.\" <i>Rodri-</i> <i>guez</i> v. <i>Chandler</i>, 382 F. 3d 670, 675 (CA7 2004), cert. denied, 543 U. S. 1156 (2005).</p>\n<p>This approach is fully consistent with our prior deci- sions. We have never held that the erroneous disqualifica- tion of counsel violates the Sixth Amendment when there is no prejudice, and while we have stated in several cases that the Sixth Amendment protects a defendant's right to counsel of choice, see <i>Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chartered</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 491 U. S. 617, 624-625 (1989); <i>Wheat</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 159; <i>Powell</i> v. <i>Alabama,</i> 287 U. S. 45, 53 (1932), we had no occasion in those cases to consider whether a violation of this right can be shown where there is no prejudice. Nor do our opinions in those cases refer to that question. It is therefore unreasonable to read our general statements regarding counsel of choice as addressing the issue of prejudice.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>But even accepting, as the majority holds, that the erroneous disqualification of counsel of choice always violates the Sixth Amendment, it still would not follow that reversal is required in all cases. The Constitution, by its terms, does not mandate any particular remedy for violations of its own provisions. Instead, we are bound in this case by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a), which instructs federal courts to \"disregar[d]\" \"[a]ny error. . . which does not affect substantial rights.\" See also 28 U. S. C. \u00a72111; <i>Chapman</i> v. <i>California,</i> 386 U. S. 18, 22 (1967). The only exceptions we have recognized to this rule have been for \"a limited class of fundamental consti- tutional errors that 'defy analysis by \"harmless error\" standards.'\" <i>Neder</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 527 U. S. 1, 7 (1999) (quoting <i>Arizona</i> v. <i>Fulminante,</i> 499 U. S. 279, 309 (1991)); see also <i>Chapman</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 23. \"Such errors . . . 'necessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair' [and] deprive defendants of 'basic protections' without which 'a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehi- cle for determination of guilt or innocence . . . and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.'\" <i>Neder</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 8-9 (quoting <i>Rose</i> v. <i>Clark,</i> 478 U. S. 570, 577-578 (1986) (second omission in original)); see also <i>ante</i>, at 9 (listing such errors).</p>\n<p>Thus, in <i>Neder</i>, we rejected the argument that the omis- sion of an element of a crime in a jury instruction \"<i>neces-</i> <i>sarily</i> render[s] a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence.\" 527 U. S., at 9. In fact, in that case, \"quite the opposite [was] true: Neder was tried before an impartial judge, under the correct standard of proof and with the assis- tance of counsel; a fairly selected, impartial jury was instructed to consider all of the evidence and argument in respect to Neder's defense . . . .\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Neder's situation\u0097with an impartial judge, the correct standard of proof, assistance of counsel, and a fair jury\u0097is much like respondent's. Fundamental unfairness does not inexorably follow from the denial of first-choice counsel. The \"decision to retain a particular lawyer\" is \"often unin- formed,\" <i>Cuyler</i> v. <i>Sullivan</i>, 446 U. S. 335, 344 (1980); a defendant's second-choice lawyer may thus turn out to be better than the defendant's first-choice lawyer. More often, a defendant's first- and second-choice lawyers may be simply indistinguishable. These possibilities would not justify violating the right to choice of counsel, but they do make me hard put to characterize the violation as \"<i>always</i> render[ing] a trial unfair,\" <i>Neder</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 9. Fairness may not limit the right, see <i>ante</i>, at 5, but it does inform the remedy.</p>\n<p>Nor is it always or nearly always impossible to deter- mine whether the first choice would have provided better representation than the second choice. There are un- doubtedly cases in which the prosecution would have little difficulty showing that the second-choice attorney was better qualified than or at least as qualified as the defen- dant's initial choice, and there are other cases in which it will be evident to the trial judge that any difference in ability or strategy could not have possibly affected the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p>Requiring a defendant to fall back on a second-choice attorney is not comparable to denying a defendant the right to be represented by counsel at all. Refusing to permit a defendant to receive the assistance of any counsel is the epitome of fundamental unfairness, and as far as the effect on the outcome is concerned, it is much more difficult to assess the effect of a complete denial of counsel than it is to assess the effect of merely preventing repre- sentation by the defendant's first-choice attorney. To be sure, when the effect of an erroneous disqualification is hard to gauge, the prosecution will be unable to meet its burden of showing that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. But that does not justify eliminating the possibility of showing harmless error in all cases.</p>\n<p>The majority's focus on the \"trial error\"/\"structural defect\" dichotomy is misleading. In <i>Fulminante</i>, we used these terms to denote two poles of constitutional error that had appeared in prior cases; trial errors always lead to harmless-error review, while structural defects always lead to automatic reversal. See 499 U. S., at 306-310. We did not suggest that trial errors are the <i>only</i> sorts of errors amenable to harmless-error review, or that <i>all</i> errors \"affecting the framework within which the trial proceeds,\" <i>id.</i>, at 310, are structural. The touchstone of structural error is fundamental unfairness and unreliability. Auto- matic reversal is strong medicine that should be reserved for constitutional errors that \"<i>always</i>\" or \"<i>necessarily</i>,\" <i>Neder</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 9 (emphasis in original), produce such unfairness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Either of the two courses outlined above\u0097requiring at least some showing of prejudice, or engaging in harmless- error review\u0097would avoid the anomalous and unjustifi- able consequences that follow from the majority's two-part rule of error without prejudice followed by automatic reversal.</p>\n<p>Under the majority's holding, a defendant who is erro- neously required to go to trial with a second-choice attor- ney is automatically entitled to a new trial even if this attorney performed brilliantly. By contrast, a defendant whose attorney was ineffective in the constitutional sense (<i>i.e.</i>, \"made errors so serious that counsel was not func- tioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed . . . by the Sixth Amendment,\" <i>Strickland</i>, 466 U. S., at 687) cannot obtain relief without showing prejudice.</p>\n<p>Under the majority's holding, a trial court may adopt rules severely restricting <i>pro hac vice</i> admissions, cf. <i>Leis</i> v. <i>Flynt</i>, 439 U. S. 438, 443 (1979) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> but if it adopts a generous rule and then errs in interpreting or applying it, the error automatically requires reversal of any conviction, regardless of whether the erroneous ruling had any effect on the defendant.</p>\n<p>Under the majority's holding, some defendants will be awarded new trials even though it is clear that the errone- ous disqualification of their first-choice counsel did not prejudice them in the least. Suppose, for example, that a defendant is initially represented by an attorney who previously represented the defendant in civil matters and who has little criminal experience. Suppose that this attorney is erroneously disqualified and that the defen- dant is then able to secure the services of a nationally acclaimed and highly experienced criminal defense attor- ney who secures a surprisingly favorable result at trial\u0097 for instance, acquittal on most but not all counts. Under the majority's holding, the trial court's erroneous ruling automatically means that the Sixth Amendment was violated\u0097even if the defendant makes no attempt to argue that the disqualified attorney would have done a better job. In fact, the defendant would still be entitled to a new trial on the counts of conviction even if the defendant publicly proclaimed after the verdict that the second at- torney had provided better representation than any other attorney in the country could have possibly done.</p>\n<p>Cases as stark as the above hypothetical are unlikely, but there are certainly cases in which the erroneous dis- qualification of a defendant's first-choice counsel neither seriously upsets the defendant's preferences nor impairs the defendant's representation at trial. As noted above, a defendant's second-choice lawyer may sometimes be better than the defendant's first-choice lawyer. Defendants who retain counsel are frequently forced to choose among attorneys whom they do not know and about whom they have limited information, and thus a defendant may not have a strong preference for any one of the candidates. In addition, if all of the attorneys considered charge roughly comparable fees, they may also be roughly comparable in experience and ability. Under these circumstances, the erroneous disqualification of a defendant's first-choice attorney may simply mean that the defendant will be represented by an attorney whom the defendant very nearly chose initially and who is able to provide represen- tation that is just as good as that which would have been furnished by the disqualified attorney. In light of these realities, mandating reversal without even a minimal showing of prejudice on the part of the defendant is unwarranted.</p>\n<p>The consequences of the majority's holding are particu- larly severe in the federal system and in other court sys- tems that do not allow a defendant to take an interlocu- tory appeal when counsel is disqualified. See <i>Flanagan</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 465 U. S. 259, 260 (1984). Under such systems, appellate review typically occurs after the defen- dant has been tried and convicted. At that point, if an appellate court concludes that the trial judge made a marginally incorrect ruling in applying its own <i>pro hac</i> <i>vice</i> rules, the appellate court has no alternative but to order a new trial\u0097even if there is not even any claim of prejudice. The Sixth Amendment does not require such results.</p>\n<p>Because I believe that some showing of prejudice is required to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment, I would vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals determine whether there was prejudice. However, assum- ing for the sake of argument that no prejudice is required, I believe that such a violation, like most constitutional violations, is amenable to harmless-error review. Our statutes demand it, and our precedents do not bar it. I would then vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals determine whether the error was harmless in this case.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The dissent proposes yet a third standard\u0097viz., that the defendant must show \" 'an identifiable difference in the quality of representation between the disqualified counsel and the attorney who represents the defendant at trial.'\" <i>Post,</i> at 4 (opinion of ALITO, J.). That proposal suffers from the same infirmities (outlined later in text) that beset the Government's positions. In addition, however, it greatly impairs the clarity of the law. How is a lower-court judge to know what an \"identi- fiable difference\" consists of? Whereas the Government at least appeals to <i>Strickland</i> and the case law under it, the most the dissent can claim by way of precedential support for its rule is that it is \"consistent with\" cases that never discussed the issue of prejudice. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[2]  The dissent resists giving effect to our cases' recognition, and the Government's concession, that a defendant has a right to be defended by counsel of his choosing. It argues that because the Sixth Amend- ment guarantees the right to the \"assistance of counsel,\" it is not violated unless \"the erroneous disqualification of a defendant's counsel of choice . . . impair[s] the assistance that a defendant receives at trial.\" <i>Post,</i> at 1-2 (opinion of ALITO, J.). But if our cases (and the Govern- ment's concession) mean anything, it is that the Sixth Amendment is violated when the erroneous disqualification of counsel \"impair[s] the assistance that a defendant receives at trial <i>[from the counsel that he</i> <i>chose].\"</i></p>\n<p>[3]  In <i>Wheat</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 486 U. S. 153 (1988), where we formu- lated the right to counsel of choice and discussed some of the limita- tions upon it, we took note of the overarching purpose of fair trial in holding that the trial court has discretion to disallow a first choice of counsel that would create serious risk of conflict of interest. <i>Id.,</i> at 159. It is one thing to conclude that the right to counsel of choice may be limited by the need for fair trial, but quite another to say that the right does not exist unless its denial renders the trial unfair.</p>\n<p>[4]  The dissent criticizes us for our trial error/structural defect dichot- omy, asserting that <i>Fulminante</i> never said that \"trial errors are the <i>only</i> sorts of errors amenable to harmless-error review, or that <i>all</i> errors affecting the framework within which the trial proceeds are structural,\" <i>post,</i> at 8 (opinion of ALITO, J.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although it is hard to read that case as doing anything other than dividing constitutional error into two comprehen- sive categories, our ensuing analysis in fact relies neither upon such comprehensiveness nor upon trial error as the touchstone for the availability of harmless-error review. Rather, here, as we have done in the past, we rest our conclusion of structural error upon the difficulty of assessing the effect of the error. See <i>Waller</i> v. <i>Georgia,</i> 467 U. S. 39, 49, n. 9 (1984) (violation of the public-trial guarantee is not subject to harmlessness review because \"the benefits of a public trial are fre- quently intangible, difficult to prove, or a matter of chance\"); <i>Vasquez</i> v. <i>Hillery,</i> 474 U. S. 254, 263 (1986) (\"[W]hen a petit jury has been selected upon improper criteria or has been exposed to prejudicial publicity, we have required reversal of the conviction because the effect of the viola- tion cannot be ascertained\"). The dissent would use \"fundamental unfairness\" as the sole criterion of structural error, and cites a case in which that was the determining factor, see <i>Neder</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 527 U. S. 1, 9 (1999) (quoted by the dissent, <i>post,</i> at 6). But this has not been the only criterion we have used. In addition to the above cases using difficulty of assessment as the test, we have also relied on the irrelevance of harmlessness, see <i>McKaskle</i> v. <i>Wiggins,</i> 465 U. S. 168, 177, n. 8 (1984) (\"Since the right to self-representation is a right that when exercised usually increases the likelihood of a trial outcome unfavor- able to the defendant, its denial is not amenable to 'harmless error' analysis\"). Thus, it is the dissent that creates a single, inflexible criterion, inconsistent with the reasoning of our precedents, when it asserts that <i>only</i> those errors that <i>always</i> or <i>necessarily</i> render a trial fundamentally unfair and unreliable are structural, <i>post,</i> at 8.</p>\n<p>[5]  In its discussion of the analysis that would be required to conduct harmless-error review, the dissent focuses on which counsel was \"better.\" See <i>post,</i> at 7-8 (opinion of ALITO, J.). This focus has the effect of making the analysis look achievable, but it is fundamentally inconsistent with the principle (which the dissent purports to accept for the sake of argument) that the Sixth Amendment can be violated without a showing of harm to the quality of representation. Cf. <i>McKaskle, supra,</i> at 177, n. 8. By framing its inquiry in these terms and expressing indignation at the thought that a defendant may receive a new trial when his actual counsel was at least as effective as the one he wanted, the dissent betrays its misunderstanding of the nature of the right to counsel of choice and its confusion of this right with the right to effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p>[1]  This view is consistent with the Government's concession that \"[t]he Sixth Amendment . . . encompasses a non-indigent defendant's right to select counsel who will represent him in a criminal prosecution,\" Brief for United States 11, though this right is \"circumscribed in several important respects,\" <i>id.</i>, at 12 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>[2]  See Act of Apr. 30, 1790, ch. 9, \u00a729, 1 Stat. 118 (providing for ap- pointment of counsel in capital cases); <i>Betts</i> v. <i>Brady</i>, 316 U. S. 455, 467, n. 20 (1942) (surveying state statutes).</p>\n<p>[3]  <i>Powell</i> is the case generally cited as first noting a defendant's right to counsel of choice. <i>Powell</i> involved an infamous trial in which the defendants were prevented from obtaining any counsel of their choice and were instead constrained to proceed with court-appointed counsel of dubious effectiveness. We held that this denied them due process and that \"a fair opportunity to secure counsel of [one's] own choice\" is a necessary concomitant of the right to counsel. 287 U. S., at 53; cf. <i>id.</i>, at 71 (\"[T]he failure of the trial court to give [petitioners] reasonable time and opportunity to secure counsel was a clear denial of due proc- ess\"). It is clear from the facts of the case that we were referring to the denial of the opportunity to choose <i>any</i> counsel, and we certainly said nothing to suggest that a violation of the right to counsel of choice could be established without any showing of prejudice.\n</p>\n<p>In <i>Wheat</i>, we held that the trial judge had not erred in declining the defendant's waiver of his right to conflict-free counsel, and therefore we had no need to consider whether an incorrect ruling would have re- quired reversal of the defendant's conviction in the absence of a show- ing of prejudice. We noted that \"the right to select and be represented by one's preferred attorney is comprehended by the Sixth Amendment,\" 486 U. S., at l59, but we went on to stress that this right \"is circum- scribed in several important respects,\" <i>ibid</i>., including by the require- ment of bar membership and rules against conflicts of interest. <i>Wheat</i> did not suggest that a violation of the limited Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice can be established without showing prejudice, and our statements about the Sixth Amendment's \"purpose\" and \"essential aim\"\u0097providing effective advocacy and a fair trial, <i>ibid.</i>\u0097suggest the opposite.</p>\n<p>Finally, in <i>Caplin &amp; Drysdale</i>, we held that the challenged action of the trial judge\u0097entering an order forfeiting funds that the defendant had earmarked for use in paying his attorneys\u0097had been proper, and, accordingly, we had no occasion to address the issue of prejudice. We recognized that \"the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to be represented by an otherwise qualified attorney whom that defendant can afford to hire, or who is willing to represent the defen- dant even though he is without funds,\" 491 U. S., at 624-625, but we added that \"[w]hatever the full extent of the Sixth Amendment's protection of one's right to retain counsel of his choosing, that protec- tion does not go beyond 'the individual's right to spend his own money to obtain the advice and assistance of . . . counsel,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 626 (omission in original).</p>\n\n</div>",

Argued April 18, 2006\u2014Decided June 26, 2006\nRespondent hired attorney Low to represent him on a federal drug\n  charge. The District Court denied Low\u2019s application for admission\n  pro hac vice on the ground that he had violated a professional con\n  duct rule and then, with one exception, prevented respondent from\n  meeting or consulting with Low throughout the trial. The jury found\n  respondent guilty. Reversing, the Eighth Circuit held that the Dis\n  trict Court erred in interpreting the disciplinary rule, that the court\u2019s\n  refusal to admit Low therefore violated respondent\u2019s Sixth Amend\n  ment right to paid counsel of his choosing, and that this violation was\n  not subject to harmless-error review.\nHeld: A trial court\u2019s erroneous deprivation of a criminal defendant\u2019s\n choice of counsel entitles him to reversal of his conviction. Pp. 3\u201312.\n     (a) In light of the Government\u2019s concession of erroneous depriva\n tion, the trial court\u2019s error violated respondent\u2019s Sixth Amendment\n right to counsel of choice. The Court rejects the Government\u2019s conten\n tion that the violation is not \u201ccomplete\u201d unless the defendant can\n show that substitute counsel was ineffective within the meaning of\n Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 691\u2013696\u2014i.e., that his per\n formance was deficient and the defendant was prejudiced by it\u2014or\n the defendant can demonstrate that substitute counsel\u2019s perform\n ance, while not deficient, was not as good as what his counsel of\n choice would have provided, creating a \u201creasonable probability that\n . . . the result . . . would have been different,\u201d id., at 694. To support\n these propositions, the Government emphasizes that the right to\n counsel is accorded to ensure that the accused receive a fair trial,\n Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U. S. 162, 166, and asserts that a trial is not\n unfair unless a defendant has been prejudiced. The right to counsel\n2                UNITED STATES v. GONZALEZ-LOPEZ\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    of choice, however, commands not that a trial be fair, but that a par\n    ticular guarantee of fairness be provided\u2014to wit, that the accused be\n    defended by the counsel he believes to be best. Cf. Crawford v. Wash\n    ington, 541 U. S. 36, 61. That right was violated here; no additional\n    showing of prejudice is required to make the violation \u201ccomplete.\u201d\n    Pp. 3\u20137.\n       (b) The Sixth Amendment violation is not subject to harmless-error\n    analysis. Erroneous deprivation of the right to counsel of choice,\n    \u201cwith consequences that are necessarily unquantifiable and indeter\n    minate, unquestionably qualifies as \u2018structural error.\u2019 \u201d Sullivan v.\n    Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275, 282. It \u201cdef[ies] analysis by \u2018harmless error\u2019\n    standards\u201d because it \u201caffec[ts] the framework within which the trial\n    proceeds\u201d and is not \u201csimply an error in the trial process itself.\u201d Ari\n    zona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 309\u2013310. Different attorneys will\n    pursue different strategies with regard to myriad trial matters, and\n    the choice of attorney will affect whether and on what terms the de\n    fendant cooperates with the prosecution, plea bargains, or decides to\n    go to trial. It is impossible to know what different choices the re\n    jected counsel would have made, and then to quantify the impact of\n    those different choices on the outcome of the proceedings. This in\n    quiry is not comparable to that required to show that a counsel\u2019s defi\n    cient performance prejudiced a defendant. Pp. 8\u201311.\n       (c) Nothing in the Court\u2019s opinion casts any doubt or places any\n    qualification upon its previous holdings limiting the right to counsel\n    of choice and recognizing trial courts\u2019 authority to establish criteria\n    for admitting lawyers to argue before them. However broad a trial\n    court\u2019s discretion may be, this Court accepts the Government\u2019s con\n    cession that the District Court erred.

His\nfamily hired attorney John Fahle to represent him. After\nthe arraignment, respondent called a California attorney,\nJoseph Low, to discuss whether Low would represent him,\neither in addition to or instead of Fahle. Low flew from\nCalifornia to meet with respondent, who hired him.\n  Some time later, Low and Fahle represented respondent\nat an evidentiary hearing before a Magistrate Judge. The\nMagistrate Judge accepted Low\u2019s provisional entry of\nappearance and permitted Low to participate in the hear\ning on the condition that he immediately file a motion for\nadmission pro hac vice. During the hearing, however, the\nMagistrate Judge revoked the provisional acceptance on\nthe ground that, by passing notes to Fahle, Low had vio\n2           UNITED STATES v. GONZALEZ-LOPEZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlated a court rule restricting the cross-examination of a\nwitness to one counsel.\n  The following week, respondent informed Fahle that he\nwanted Low to be his only attorney. Low then filed an\napplication for admission pro hac vice. The District Court\ndenied his application without comment. A month later,\nLow filed a second application, which the District Court\nagain denied without explanation. Low\u2019s appeal, in the\nform of an application for a writ of mandamus, was dis\nmissed by the United States Court of Appeals for the\nEighth Circuit.\n  Fahle filed a motion to withdraw as counsel and for a\nshow-cause hearing to consider sanctions against Low.\nFahle asserted that, by contacting respondent while re\nspondent was represented by Fahle, Low violated Mo.\nRule of Professional Conduct 4\u20134.2 (1993), which prohibits\na lawyer \u201c[i]n representing a client\u201d from \u201ccommuni\ncat[ing] about the subject of the representation with a\nparty . . . represented by another lawyer\u201d without that\nlawyer\u2019s consent. Low filed a motion to strike Fahle\u2019s\nmotion. The District Court granted Fahle\u2019s motion to\nwithdraw and granted a continuance so that respondent\ncould find new representation. Respondent retained a\nlocal attorney, Karl Dickhaus, for the trial. The District\nCourt then denied Low\u2019s motion to strike and, for the first\ntime, explained that it had denied Low\u2019s motions for ad\nmission pro hac vice primarily because, in a separate case\nbefore it, Low had violated Rule 4\u20134.2 by communicating\nwith a represented party.\n  The case proceeded to trial, and Dickhaus represented\nrespondent. Low again moved for admission and was\nagain denied. The Court also denied Dickhaus\u2019s request to\nhave Low at counsel table with him and ordered Low to sit\nin the audience and to have no contact with Dickhaus\nduring the proceedings. To enforce the Court\u2019s order, a\nUnited States Marshal sat between Low and Dickhaus at\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

The jury\nfound respondent guilty.\n   After trial, the District Court granted Fahle\u2019s motion for\nsanctions against Low. It read Rule 4\u20134.2 to forbid Low\u2019s\ncontact with respondent without Fahle\u2019s permission. It\nalso reiterated that it had denied Low\u2019s motions for admis\nsion on the ground that Low had violated the same Rule in\na separate matter.\n   Respondent appealed, and the Eighth Circuit vacated\nthe conviction. 399 F. 3d 924 (2005). The Court first held\nthat the District Court erred in interpreting Rule 4\u20134.2 to\nprohibit Low\u2019s conduct both in this case and in the sepa\nrate matter on which the District Court based its denials\nof his admission motions. The District Court\u2019s denials of\nthese motions were therefore erroneous and violated\nrespondent\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to paid counsel of his\nchoosing. See id., at 928\u2013932. The Court then concluded\nthat this Sixth Amendment violation was not subject to\nharmless-error review. See id., at 932\u2013935. We granted\ncertiorari. 546 U.

United States, 491\nU. S. 617, 624\u2013625 (1989). To be sure, the right to counsel\nof choice \u201cis circumscribed in several important respects.\u201d\nWheat, supra, at 159. But the Government does not dispute\nthe Eighth Circuit\u2019s conclusion in this case that the District\nCourt erroneously deprived respondent of his counsel of\nchoice.\n  The Government contends, however, that the Sixth\nAmendment violation is not \u201ccomplete\u201d unless the defen\ndant can show that substitute counsel was ineffective\nwithin the meaning of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.\n668, 691\u2013696 (1984)\u2014i.e., that substitute counsel\u2019s per\nformance was deficient and the defendant was prejudiced\nby it. In the alternative, the Government contends that\nthe defendant must at least demonstrate that his counsel\nof choice would have pursued a different strategy that\nwould have created a \u201creasonable probability that . . . the\nresult of the proceedings would have been different,\u201d id.,\nat 694\u2014in other words, that he was prejudiced within the\nmeaning of Strickland by the denial of his counsel of\nchoice even if substitute counsel\u2019s performance was not\nconstitutionally deficient.1 To support these propositions,\nthe Government points to our prior cases, which note that\nthe right to counsel \u201chas been accorded . . . not for its own\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Thedissent proposes yet a third standard\u2014viz., that the defendant\nmust show \u201c \u2018an identifiable difference in the quality of representation\nbetween the disqualified counsel and the attorney who represents the\ndefendant at trial.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 4 (opinion of ALITO, J.). That proposal\nsuffers from the same infirmities (outlined later in text) that beset the\nGovernment\u2019s positions. In addition, however, it greatly impairs the\nclarity of the law. How is a lower-court judge to know what an \u201cidenti\nfiable difference\u201d consists of? Whereas the Government at least appeals\nto Strickland and the case law under it, the most the dissent can claim\nby way of precedential support for its rule is that it is \u201cconsistent with\u201d\ncases that never discussed the issue of prejudice.

S. ____ (2006)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsake, but for the effect it has on the ability of the accused\nto receive a fair trial.\u201d Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U. S. 162,\n166 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). A trial is\nnot unfair and thus the Sixth Amendment is not violated,\nthe Government reasons, unless a defendant has been\nprejudiced.\n   Stated as broadly as this, the Government\u2019s argument in\neffect reads the Sixth Amendment as a more detailed\nversion of the Due Process Clause\u2014and then proceeds to\ngive no effect to the details. It is true enough that the\npurpose of the rights set forth in that Amendment is to\nensure a fair trial; but it does not follow that the rights\ncan be disregarded so long as the trial is, on the whole,\nfair. What the Government urges upon us here is what\nwas urged upon us (successfully, at one time, see Ohio v.\nRoberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980)) with regard to the Sixth\nAmendment\u2019s right of confrontation\u2014a line of reasoning\nthat \u201cabstracts from the right to its purposes, and then\neliminates the right.\u201d Maryland v. Craig, 497 U. S. 836,\n862 (1990) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Since, it was argued,\nthe purpose of the Confrontation Clause was to ensure the\nreliability of evidence, so long as the testimonial hearsay\nbore \u201cindicia of reliability,\u201d the Confrontation Clause was\nnot violated. See Roberts, supra, at 65\u201366. We rejected\nthat argument (and our prior cases that had accepted it) in\nCrawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36 (2004), saying that\nthe Confrontation Clause \u201ccommands, not that evidence be\nreliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular\nmanner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.\u201d\nId., at 61.\n   So also with the Sixth Amendment right to counsel of\nchoice. It commands, not that a trial be fair, but that a\nparticular guarantee of fairness be provided\u2014to wit, that\nthe accused be defended by the counsel he believes to be\nbest. \u201cThe Constitution guarantees a fair trial through\nthe Due Process Clauses, but it defines the basic elements\n6               UNITED STATES v. GONZALEZ-LOPEZ\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nof a fair trial largely through the several provisions of the\nSixth Amendment, including the Counsel Clause.\u201d Strick\nland, supra, at 684\u2013685. In sum, the right at stake here is\nthe right to counsel of choice, not the right to a fair trial;\nand that right was violated because the deprivation of\ncounsel was erroneous. No additional showing of preju\ndice is required to make the violation \u201ccomplete.\u201d2\n   The cases the Government relies on involve the right to\nthe effective assistance of counsel, the violation of which\ngenerally requires a defendant to establish prejudice. See,\ne.g., Strickland, supra, at 694; Mickens, supra, at 166;\nUnited States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648 (1984). The earliest\ncase generally cited for the proposition that \u201cthe right to\ncounsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel,\u201d\nMcMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S. 759, 771, n. 14 (1970),\nwas based on the Due Process Clause rather than on the\nSixth Amendment, see Powell, 287 U. S., at 57 (cited in\ne.g., McMann, supra, at 771, n. 14). And even our recogni\ntion of the right to effective counsel within the Sixth\nAmendment was a consequence of our perception that\nrepresentation by counsel \u201cis critical to the ability of the\nadversarial system to produce just results.\u201d Strickland,\nsupra, at 685. Having derived the right to effective repre\nsentation from the purpose of ensuring a fair trial, we\nhave, logically enough, also derived the limits of that right\nfrom that same purpose. See Mickens, supra, at 166. The\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Thedissent resists giving effect to our cases\u2019 recognition, and the\nGovernment\u2019s concession, that a defendant has a right to be defended\nby counsel of his choosing. It argues that because the Sixth Amend\nment guarantees the right to the \u201cassistance of counsel,\u201d it is not\nviolated unless \u201cthe erroneous disqualification of a defendant\u2019s counsel\nof choice . . . impair[s] the assistance that a defendant receives at trial.\u201d\nPost, at 1\u20132 (opinion of ALITO, J.). But if our cases (and the Govern\nment\u2019s concession) mean anything, it is that the Sixth Amendment is\nviolated when the erroneous disqualification of counsel \u201cimpair[s] the\nassistance that a defendant receives at trial [from the counsel that he\nchose].\u201d\n                      Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                      7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nrequirement that a defendant show prejudice in effective\nrepresentation cases arises from the very nature of the\nspecific element of the right to counsel at issue there\u2014\neffective (not mistake-free) representation. Counsel cannot\nbe \u201cineffective\u201d unless his mistakes have harmed the\ndefense (or, at least, unless it is reasonably likely that\nthey have). Thus, a violation of the Sixth Amendment\nright to effective representation is not \u201ccomplete\u201d until the\ndefendant is prejudiced. See Strickland, supra, at 685.\n   The right to select counsel of one\u2019s choice, by contrast,\nhas never been derived from the Sixth Amendment\u2019s\npurpose of ensuring a fair trial.3 It has been regarded as\nthe root meaning of the constitutional guarantee. See\nWheat, 486 U. S., at 159; Andersen v. Treat, 172 U. S. 24\n(1898). See generally W. Beaney, The Right to Counsel in\nAmerican Courts 18\u201324, 27\u201333 (1955). Cf. Powell, supra,\nat 53. Where the right to be assisted by counsel of one\u2019s\nchoice is wrongly denied, therefore, it is unnecessary to\nconduct an ineffectiveness or prejudice inquiry to establish\na Sixth Amendment violation. Deprivation of the right is\n\u201ccomplete\u201d when the defendant is erroneously prevented\nfrom being represented by the lawyer he wants, regardless\nof the quality of the representation he received. To argue\notherwise is to confuse the right to counsel of choice\u2014\nwhich is the right to a particular lawyer regardless of\ncomparative effectiveness\u2014with the right to effective\ncounsel\u2014which imposes a baseline requirement of compe\ntence on whatever lawyer is chosen or appointed.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 In Wheat v. United States, 486 U. S. 153 (1988), where we formu\nlated the right to counsel of choice and discussed some of the limita\ntions upon it, we took note of the overarching purpose of fair trial in\nholding that the trial court has discretion to disallow a first choice of\ncounsel that would create serious risk of conflict of interest. Id., at 159.\nIt is one thing to conclude that the right to counsel of choice may be\nlimited by the need for fair trial, but quite another to say that the right\ndoes not exist unless its denial renders the trial unfair.\n8              UNITED STATES v. GONZALEZ-LOPEZ\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                             III\n   Having concluded, in light of the Government\u2019s conces\nsion of erroneous deprivation, that the trial court violated\nrespondent\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice,\nwe must consider whether this error is subject to review\nfor harmlessness. In Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279\n(1991), we divided constitutional errors into two classes.\nThe first we called \u201ctrial error,\u201d because the errors \u201coc\ncurred during presentation of the case to the jury\u201d and\ntheir effect may \u201cbe quantitatively assessed in the context\nof other evidence presented in order to determine whether\n[they were] harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., at\n307\u2013308 (internal quotation marks omitted). These in\nclude \u201cmost constitutional errors.\u201d Id., at 306. The second\nclass of constitutional error we called \u201cstructural defects.\u201d\nThese \u201cdefy analysis by \u2018harmless-error\u2019 standards\u201d be\ncause they \u201caffec[t] the framework within which the trial\nproceeds,\u201d and are not \u201csimply an error in the trial process\nitself.\u201d Id., at 309\u2013310.4 See also Neder v. United States,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    The dissent criticizes us for our trial error/structural defect dichot\n    4\n\nomy, asserting that Fulminante never said that \u201ctrial errors are the\nonly sorts of errors amenable to harmless-error review, or that all\nerrors affecting the framework within which the trial proceeds are\nstructural,\u201d post, at 8 (opinion of ALITO, J.) (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted). Although it is hard to read that case as doing\nanything other than dividing constitutional error into two comprehen\nsive categories, our ensuing analysis in fact relies neither upon such\ncomprehensiveness nor upon trial error as the touchstone for the\navailability of harmless-error review. Rather, here, as we have done in\nthe past, we rest our conclusion of structural error upon the difficulty of\nassessing the effect of the error. See Waller v. Georgia, 467 U. S. 39,\n49, n. 9 (1984) (violation of the public-trial guarantee is not subject to\nharmlessness review because \u201cthe benefits of a public trial are fre\nquently intangible, difficult to prove, or a matter of chance\u201d); Vasquez v.\nHillery, 474 U. S. 254, 263 (1986) (\u201c[W]hen a petit jury has been selected\nupon improper criteria or has been exposed to prejudicial publicity, we\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

S. 335 (1963),\nthe denial of the right of self-representation, see McKaskle\nv. Wiggins, 465 U. S. 168, 177\u2013178, n. 8 (1984), the denial of\nthe right to public trial, see Waller v. Georgia, 467 U. S. 39,\n49, n. 9 (1984), and the denial of the right to trial by jury by\nthe giving of a defective reasonable-doubt instruction, see\nSullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275 (1993).\n   We have little trouble concluding that erroneous depri\nvation of the right to counsel of choice, \u201cwith consequences\nthat are necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate,\nunquestionably qualifies as \u2018structural error.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 282.\nDifferent attorneys will pursue different strategies with\nregard to investigation and discovery, development of the\ntheory of defense, selection of the jury, presentation of the\nwitnesses, and style of witness examination and jury\nargument. And the choice of attorney will affect whether\nand on what terms the defendant cooperates with the\nprosecution, plea bargains, or decides instead to go to trial.\nIn light of these myriad aspects of representation, the\nerroneous denial of counsel bears directly on the \u201cframe\nwork within which the trial proceeds,\u201d Fulminante, supra,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nhave required reversal of the conviction because the effect of the viola\ntion cannot be ascertained\u201d). The dissent would use \u201cfundamental\nunfairness\u201d as the sole criterion of structural error, and cites a case in\nwhich that was the determining factor, see Neder v. United States, 527\nU. S. 1, 9 (1999) (quoted by the dissent, post, at 6). But this has not\nbeen the only criterion we have used. In addition to the above cases\nusing difficulty of assessment as the test, we have also relied on the\nirrelevance of harmlessness, see McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U. S. 168, 177,\nn. 8 (1984) (\u201cSince the right to self-representation is a right that when\nexercised usually increases the likelihood of a trial outcome unfavor\nable to the defendant, its denial is not amenable to \u2018harmless error\u2019\nanalysis\u201d). Thus, it is the dissent that creates a single, inflexible\ncriterion, inconsistent with the reasoning of our precedents, when it\nasserts that only those errors that always or necessarily render a trial\nfundamentally unfair and unreliable are structural, post, at 8.\n10          UNITED STATES v. GONZALEZ-LOPEZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat 310\u2014or indeed on whether it proceeds at all. It is\nimpossible to know what different choices the rejected\ncounsel would have made, and then to quantify the impact\nof those different choices on the outcome of the proceed\nings. Many counseled decisions, including those involving\nplea bargains and cooperation with the government, do\nnot even concern the conduct of the trial at all. Harmless-\nerror analysis in such a context would be a speculative\ninquiry into what might have occurred in an alternate\nuniverse.\n  The Government acknowledges that the deprivation of\nchoice of counsel pervades the entire trial, but points out\nthat counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness may also do so and yet we do\nnot allow reversal of a conviction for that reason without a\nshowing of prejudice. But the requirement of showing\nprejudice in ineffectiveness claims stems from the very\ndefinition of the right at issue; it is not a matter of show\ning that the violation was harmless, but of showing that a\nviolation of the right to effective representation occurred.\nA choice-of-counsel violation occurs whenever the defen\ndant\u2019s choice is wrongfully denied. Moreover, if and when\ncounsel\u2019s ineffectiveness \u201cpervades\u201d a trial, it does so (to\nthe extent we can detect it) through identifiable mistakes.\nWe can assess how those mistakes affected the outcome.\nTo determine the effect of wrongful denial of choice of\ncounsel, however, we would not be looking for mistakes\ncommitted by the actual counsel, but for differences in the\ndefense that would have been made by the rejected coun\nsel\u2014in matters ranging from questions asked on voir dire\nand cross-examination to such intangibles as argument\nstyle and relationship with the prosecutors. We would\nhave to speculate upon what matters the rejected counsel\nwould have handled differently\u2014or indeed, would have\nhandled the same but with the benefit of a more jury-\npleasing courtroom style or a longstanding relationship of\ntrust with the prosecutors. And then we would have to\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

The difficulties of\nconducting the two assessments of prejudice are not re\nmotely comparable.5\n                              IV\n   Nothing we have said today casts any doubt or places\nany qualification upon our previous holdings that limit the\nright to counsel of choice and recognize the authority of\ntrial courts to establish criteria for admitting lawyers to\nargue before them. As the dissent too discusses, post, at 3,\nthe right to counsel of choice does not extend to defendants\nwho require counsel to be appointed for them. See Wheat,\n486 U. S., at 159; Caplin & Drysdale, 491 U. S., at 624,\n626. Nor may a defendant insist on representation by a\nperson who is not a member of the bar, or demand that a\ncourt honor his waiver of conflict-free representation. See\nWheat, 486 U. S., at 159\u2013160. We have recognized a trial\ncourt\u2019s wide latitude in balancing the right to counsel of\nchoice against the needs of fairness, id., at 163\u2013164, and\nagainst the demands of its calendar, Morris v. Slappy, 461\nU. S. 1, 11\u201312 (1983). The court has, moreover, an \u201cinde\npendent interest in ensuring that criminal trials are con\nducted within the ethical standards of the profession and\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 In its discussion of the analysis that would be required to conduct\n\nharmless-error review, the dissent focuses on which counsel was\n\u201cbetter.\u201d See post, at 7\u20138 (opinion of ALITO, J.). This focus has the\neffect of making the analysis look achievable, but it is fundamentally\ninconsistent with the principle (which the dissent purports to accept for\nthe sake of argument) that the Sixth Amendment can be violated\nwithout a showing of harm to the quality of representation. Cf.\nMcKaskle, supra, at 177, n. 8. By framing its inquiry in these terms\nand expressing indignation at the thought that a defendant may receive\na new trial when his actual counsel was at least as effective as the one\nhe wanted, the dissent betrays its misunderstanding of the nature of\nthe right to counsel of choice and its confusion of this right with the\nright to effective assistance of counsel.\n12          UNITED STATES v. GONZALEZ-LOPEZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat legal proceedings appear fair to all who observe\nthem.\u201d Wheat, supra, at 160. None of these limitations on\nthe right to choose one\u2019s counsel is relevant here. This is\nnot a case about a court\u2019s power to enforce rules or adhere\nto practices that determine which attorneys may appear\nbefore it, or to make scheduling and other decisions that\neffectively exclude a defendant\u2019s first choice of counsel.\nHowever broad a court\u2019s discretion may be, the Govern\nment has conceded that the District Court here erred\nwhen it denied respondent his choice of counsel. Accept\ning that premise, we hold that the error violated respon\ndent\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice and\nthat this violation is not subject to harmless-error\nanalysis.\n                     *    *     *\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                        It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

Instead, a defendant should be required to make\nat least some showing that the trial court\u2019s erroneous\nruling adversely affected the quality of assistance that the\ndefendant received. In my view, the majority\u2019s contrary\nholding is based on an incorrect interpretation of the Sixth\nAmendment and a misapplication of harmless-error prin\nciples. I respectfully dissent.\n                              I\n  The majority makes a subtle but important mistake at\nthe outset in its characterization of what the Sixth\nAmendment guarantees. The majority states that the\nSixth Amendment protects \u201cthe right of a defendant who\ndoes not require appointed counsel to choose who will\nrepresent him.\u201d Ante, at 3. What the Sixth Amendment\nactually protects, however, is the right to have the assis\ntance that the defendant\u2019s counsel of choice is able to\nprovide. It follows that if the erroneous disqualification of\n2              UNITED STATES v. GONZALEZ-LOPEZ\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\na defendant\u2019s counsel of choice does not impair the assis\ntance that a defendant receives at trial, there is no viola\ntion of the Sixth Amendment.1\n    The language of the Sixth Amendment supports this\ninterpretation. The Assistance of Counsel Clause focuses\non what a defendant is entitled to receive (\u201cAssistance\u201d),\nrather than on the identity of the provider. The back\nground of the adoption of the Sixth Amendment points in\nthe same direction. The specific evil against which the\nAssistance of Counsel Clause was aimed was the English\ncommon-law rule severely limiting a felony defendant\u2019s\nability to be assisted by counsel. United States v. Ash, 413\nU. S. 300, 306 (1973). \u201c[T]he core purpose of the counsel\nguarantee was to assure \u2018Assistance\u2019 at trial,\u201d id., at 309,\nand thereby \u201cto assure fairness in the adversary criminal\nprocess,\u201d United States v. Morrison, 449 U. S. 361, 364\n(1981). It was not \u201cthe essential aim of the Amendment\n. . . to ensure that a defendant will inexorably be repre\nsented by the lawyer whom he prefers.\u201d Wheat v. United\nStates, 486 U. S. 153, 159 (1988); cf. Morris v. Slappy, 461\nU. S. 1, 14 (1983) (\u201c[W]e reject the claim that the Sixth\nAmendment guarantees a \u2018meaningful relationship\u2019 be\ntween an accused and his counsel\u201d).\n    There is no doubt, of course, that the right \u201cto have the\nAssistance of Counsel\u201d carries with it a limited right to be\nrepresented by counsel of choice. At the time of the adop\ntion of the Bill of Rights, when the availability of ap\npointed counsel was generally limited,2 that is how the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 This\n         view is consistent with the Government\u2019s concession that \u201c[t]he\nSixth Amendment . . . encompasses a non-indigent defendant\u2019s right to\nselect counsel who will represent him in a criminal prosecution,\u201d Brief\nfor United States 11, though this right is \u201ccircumscribed in several\nimportant respects,\u201d id., at 12 (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n  2 See Act of Apr. 30, 1790, ch. 9, \u00a729, 1 Stat. 118 (providing for ap\n\npointment of counsel in capital cases); Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455,\n                      Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)        3\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nright inevitably played out: A defendant\u2019s right to have the\nassistance of counsel necessarily meant the right to have\nthe assistance of whatever counsel the defendant was able\nto secure. But from the beginning, the right to counsel of\nchoice has been circumscribed.\n   For one thing, a defendant\u2019s choice of counsel has al\nways been restricted by the rules governing admission to\npractice before the court in question. The Judiciary Act of\n1789 made this clear, providing that parties \u201cin all the\ncourts of the United States\u201d had the right to \u201cthe assis\ntance of such counsel or attorneys at law as by the rules of\nthe said courts respectively shall be permitted to manage\nand conduct cases therein.\u201d Ch. 20, \u00a735, 1 Stat. 92.\nTherefore, if a defendant\u2019s first-choice attorney was not\neligible to appear under the rules of a particular court, the\ndefendant had no right to be represented by that attorney.\nIndeed, if a defendant\u2019s top 10 or top 25 choices were all\nattorneys who were not eligible to appear in the court in\nquestion, the defendant had no right to be represented by\nany of them. Today, rules governing admission to practice\nbefore particular courts continue to limit the ability of a\ncriminal defendant to be represented by counsel of choice.\nSee Wheat, 486 U. S., at 159.\n   The right to counsel of choice is also limited by conflict-\nof-interest rules. Even if a defendant is aware that his or\nher attorney of choice has a conflict, and even if the defen\ndant is eager to waive any objection, the defendant has no\nconstitutional right to be represented by that attorney.\nSee id., at 159\u2013160.\n   Similarly, the right to be represented by counsel of\nchoice can be limited by mundane case-management\nconsiderations. If a trial judge schedules a trial to begin\non a particular date and defendant\u2019s counsel of choice is\nalready committed for other trials until some time thereaf\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n467, n. 20 (1942) (surveying state statutes). \n\n4           UNITED STATES v. GONZALEZ-LOPEZ\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nter, the trial judge has discretion under appropriate cir\ncumstances to refuse to postpone the trial date and\nthereby, in effect, to force the defendant to forgo counsel of\nchoice. See, e.g., Slappy, supra; United States v. Hughey,\n147 F. 3d 423, 428\u2013431 (CA5 1998).\n   These limitations on the right to counsel of choice are\ntolerable because the focus of the right is the quality of the\nrepresentation that the defendant receives, not the iden\ntity of the attorney who provides the representation.\nLimiting a defendant to those attorneys who are willing,\navailable, and eligible to represent the defendant still\nleaves a defendant with a pool of attorneys to choose\nfrom\u2014and, in most jurisdictions today, a large and diverse\npool. Thus, these restrictions generally have no adverse\neffect on a defendant\u2019s ability to secure the best assistance\nthat the defendant\u2019s circumstances permit.\n   Because the Sixth Amendment focuses on the quality of\nthe assistance that counsel of choice would have provided,\nI would hold that the erroneous disqualification of counsel\ndoes not violate the Sixth Amendment unless the ruling\ndiminishes the quality of assistance that the defendant\nwould have otherwise received. This would not require a\ndefendant to show that the second-choice attorney was\nconstitutionally ineffective within the meaning of Strick\nland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Rather, the\ndefendant would be entitled to a new trial if the defendant\ncould show \u201can identifiable difference in the quality of\nrepresentation between the disqualified counsel and the\nattorney who represents the defendant at trial.\u201d Rodri\nguez v. Chandler, 382 F. 3d 670, 675 (CA7 2004), cert.\ndenied, 543 U. S. 1156 (2005).\n   This approach is fully consistent with our prior deci\nsions. We have never held that the erroneous disqualifica\ntion of counsel violates the Sixth Amendment when there\nis no prejudice, and while we have stated in several cases\nthat the Sixth Amendment protects a defendant\u2019s right to\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

S. 45, 53 (1932),\nwe had no occasion in those cases to consider whether a\nviolation of this right can be shown where there is no\nprejudice. Nor do our opinions in those cases refer to that\nquestion. It is therefore unreasonable to read our general\nstatements regarding counsel of choice as addressing the\nissue of prejudice.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Powell is the case generally cited as first noting a defendant\u2019s right\n\nto counsel of choice. Powell involved an infamous trial in which the\ndefendants were prevented from obtaining any counsel of their choice\nand were instead constrained to proceed with court-appointed counsel\nof dubious effectiveness. We held that this denied them due process\nand that \u201ca fair opportunity to secure counsel of [one\u2019s] own choice\u201d is a\nnecessary concomitant of the right to counsel. 287 U. S., at 53; cf. id.,\nat 71 (\u201c[T]he failure of the trial court to give [petitioners] reasonable\ntime and opportunity to secure counsel was a clear denial of due proc\ness\u201d). It is clear from the facts of the case that we were referring to the\ndenial of the opportunity to choose any counsel, and we certainly said\nnothing to suggest that a violation of the right to counsel of choice could\nbe established without any showing of prejudice.\n  In Wheat, we held that the trial judge had not erred in declining the\ndefendant\u2019s waiver of his right to conflict-free counsel, and therefore we\nhad no need to consider whether an incorrect ruling would have re\nquired reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction in the absence of a show\ning of prejudice. We noted that \u201cthe right to select and be represented\nby one\u2019s preferred attorney is comprehended by the Sixth Amendment,\u201d\n486 U. S., at l59, but we went on to stress that this right \u201cis circum\nscribed in several important respects,\u201d ibid., including by the require\nment of bar membership and rules against conflicts of interest. Wheat\ndid not suggest that a violation of the limited Sixth Amendment right\nto counsel of choice can be established without showing prejudice, and\nour statements about the Sixth Amendment\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d and \u201cessential\naim\u201d\u2014providing effective advocacy and a fair trial, ibid.\u2014suggest the\nopposite.\n  Finally, in Caplin & Drysdale, we held that the challenged action of\nthe trial judge\u2014entering an order forfeiting funds that the defendant\nhad earmarked for use in paying his attorneys\u2014had been proper, and,\naccordingly, we had no occasion to address the issue of prejudice. We\nrecognized that \u201cthe Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the\n6               UNITED STATES v. GONZALEZ-LOPEZ\n\n                            ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n                               II\n    But even accepting, as the majority holds, that the\nerroneous disqualification of counsel of choice always\nviolates the Sixth Amendment, it still would not follow\nthat reversal is required in all cases. The Constitution, by\nits terms, does not mandate any particular remedy for\nviolations of its own provisions. Instead, we are bound in\nthis case by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a),\nwhich instructs federal courts to \u201cdisregar[d]\u201d \u201c[a]ny error\n. . . which does not affect substantial rights.\u201d See also 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72111; Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 22\n(1967). The only exceptions we have recognized to this\nrule have been for \u201ca limited class of fundamental consti\ntutional errors that \u2018defy analysis by \u201charmless error\u201d\nstandards.\u2019 \u201d Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 7 (1999)\n(quoting Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.

In fact, in that case, \u201cquite the opposite\n[was] true: Neder was tried before an impartial judge,\nunder the correct standard of proof and with the assis\ntance of counsel; a fairly selected, impartial jury was\ninstructed to consider all of the evidence and argument in\nrespect to Neder\u2019s defense . . . .\u201d Ibid.\n  Neder\u2019s situation\u2014with an impartial judge, the correct\nstandard of proof, assistance of counsel, and a fair jury\u2014is\nmuch like respondent\u2019s. Fundamental unfairness does not\ninexorably follow from the denial of first-choice counsel.\nThe \u201cdecision to retain a particular lawyer\u201d is \u201coften unin\nformed,\u201d Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U. S. 335, 344 (1980); a\ndefendant\u2019s second-choice lawyer may thus turn out to be\nbetter than the defendant\u2019s first-choice lawyer. More\noften, a defendant\u2019s first- and second-choice lawyers may\nbe simply indistinguishable. These possibilities would not\njustify violating the right to choice of counsel, but they do\nmake me hard put to characterize the violation as \u201calways\nrender[ing] a trial unfair,\u201d Neder, supra, at 9. Fairness\nmay not limit the right, see ante, at 5, but it does inform\nthe remedy.\n  Nor is it always or nearly always impossible to deter\nmine whether the first choice would have provided better\nrepresentation than the second choice. There are un\ndoubtedly cases in which the prosecution would have little\ndifficulty showing that the second-choice attorney was\nbetter qualified than or at least as qualified as the defen\ndant\u2019s initial choice, and there are other cases in which it\nwill be evident to the trial judge that any difference in\nability or strategy could not have possibly affected the\noutcome of the trial.\n  Requiring a defendant to fall back on a second-choice\nattorney is not comparable to denying a defendant the\nright to be represented by counsel at all. Refusing to\npermit a defendant to receive the assistance of any counsel\n8           UNITED STATES v. GONZALEZ-LOPEZ\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nis the epitome of fundamental unfairness, and as far as\nthe effect on the outcome is concerned, it is much more\ndifficult to assess the effect of a complete denial of counsel\nthan it is to assess the effect of merely preventing repre\nsentation by the defendant\u2019s first-choice attorney. To be\nsure, when the effect of an erroneous disqualification is\nhard to gauge, the prosecution will be unable to meet its\nburden of showing that the error was harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt. But that does not justify eliminating\nthe possibility of showing harmless error in all cases.\n  The majority\u2019s focus on the \u201ctrial error\u201d/\u201cstructural\ndefect\u201d dichotomy is misleading. In Fulminante, we used\nthese terms to denote two poles of constitutional error that\nhad appeared in prior cases; trial errors always lead to\nharmless-error review, while structural defects always\nlead to automatic reversal. See 499 U. S., at 306\u2013310. We\ndid not suggest that trial errors are the only sorts of errors\namenable to harmless-error review, or that all errors\n\u201caffecting the framework within which the trial proceeds,\u201d\nid., at 310, are structural. The touchstone of structural\nerror is fundamental unfairness and unreliability. Auto\nmatic reversal is strong medicine that should be reserved\nfor constitutional errors that \u201calways\u201d or \u201cnecessarily,\u201d\nNeder, supra, at 9 (emphasis in original), produce such\nunfairness.\n                            III\n  Either of the two courses outlined above\u2014requiring at\nleast some showing of prejudice, or engaging in harmless-\nerror review\u2014would avoid the anomalous and unjustifi\nable consequences that follow from the majority\u2019s two-part\nrule of error without prejudice followed by automatic\nreversal.\n  Under the majority\u2019s holding, a defendant who is erro\nneously required to go to trial with a second-choice attor\nney is automatically entitled to a new trial even if this\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           9\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nattorney performed brilliantly. By contrast, a defendant\nwhose attorney was ineffective in the constitutional sense\n(i.e., \u201cmade errors so serious that counsel was not func\ntioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed . . . by the Sixth\nAmendment,\u201d Strickland, 466 U. S., at 687) cannot obtain\nrelief without showing prejudice.\n   Under the majority\u2019s holding, a trial court may adopt\nrules severely restricting pro hac vice admissions, cf. Leis\nv. Flynt, 439 U. S. 438, 443 (1979) (per curiam), but if it\nadopts a generous rule and then errs in interpreting or\napplying it, the error automatically requires reversal of\nany conviction, regardless of whether the erroneous ruling\nhad any effect on the defendant.\n   Under the majority\u2019s holding, some defendants will be\nawarded new trials even though it is clear that the errone\nous disqualification of their first-choice counsel did not\nprejudice them in the least. Suppose, for example, that a\ndefendant is initially represented by an attorney who\npreviously represented the defendant in civil matters and\nwho has little criminal experience. Suppose that this\nattorney is erroneously disqualified and that the defen\ndant is then able to secure the services of a nationally\nacclaimed and highly experienced criminal defense attor\nney who secures a surprisingly favorable result at trial\u2014\nfor instance, acquittal on most but not all counts. Under\nthe majority\u2019s holding, the trial court\u2019s erroneous ruling\nautomatically means that the Sixth Amendment was\nviolated\u2014even if the defendant makes no attempt to argue\nthat the disqualified attorney would have done a better\njob. In fact, the defendant would still be entitled to a new\ntrial on the counts of conviction even if the defendant\npublicly proclaimed after the verdict that the second at\ntorney had provided better representation than any other\nattorney in the country could have possibly done.\n   Cases as stark as the above hypothetical are unlikely,\nbut there are certainly cases in which the erroneous dis\n10          UNITED STATES v. GONZALEZ-LOPEZ\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nqualification of a defendant\u2019s first-choice counsel neither\nseriously upsets the defendant\u2019s preferences nor impairs\nthe defendant\u2019s representation at trial. As noted above, a\ndefendant\u2019s second-choice lawyer may sometimes be better\nthan the defendant\u2019s first-choice lawyer. Defendants who\nretain counsel are frequently forced to choose among\nattorneys whom they do not know and about whom they\nhave limited information, and thus a defendant may not\nhave a strong preference for any one of the candidates. In\naddition, if all of the attorneys considered charge roughly\ncomparable fees, they may also be roughly comparable in\nexperience and ability. Under these circumstances, the\nerroneous disqualification of a defendant\u2019s first-choice\nattorney may simply mean that the defendant will be\nrepresented by an attorney whom the defendant very\nnearly chose initially and who is able to provide represen\ntation that is just as good as that which would have been\nfurnished by the disqualified attorney. In light of these\nrealities, mandating reversal without even a minimal\nshowing of prejudice on the part of the defendant is\nunwarranted.\n  The consequences of the majority\u2019s holding are particu\nlarly severe in the federal system and in other court sys\ntems that do not allow a defendant to take an interlocu\ntory appeal when counsel is disqualified. See Flanagan v.\nUnited States, 465 U. S. 259, 260 (1984). Under such\nsystems, appellate review typically occurs after the defen\ndant has been tried and convicted. At that point, if an\nappellate court concludes that the trial judge made a\nmarginally incorrect ruling in applying its own pro hac\nvice rules, the appellate court has no alternative but to\norder a new trial\u2014even if there is not even any claim of\nprejudice. The Sixth Amendment does not require such\nresults.\n  Because I believe that some showing of prejudice is\nrequired to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment,\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          11\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nI would vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals\ndetermine whether there was prejudice. However, assum\ning for the sake of argument that no prejudice is required,\nI believe that such a violation, like most constitutional\nviolations, is amenable to harmless-error review. Our\nstatutes demand it, and our precedents do not bar it. I\nwould then vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals\ndetermine whether the error was harmless in this case.\n",

His family hired attorney John Fahle to represent him. After the arraignment, respondent called a California attorney, Joseph Low, to discuss whether Low would represent him, either in addition to or instead of Fahle. Low flew from California to meet with respondent, who hired him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Some time later, Low and Fahle represented respondent at an evidentiary hearing before a Magistrate Judge. The Magistrate Judge accepted Low's provisional entry of appearance and permitted Low to participate in the hear- ing on the condition that he immediately file a motion for admission <i>pro hac vice</i>. During the hearing, however, the Magistrate Judge revoked the provisional acceptance on the ground that, by passing notes to Fahle, Low had vio- lated a court rule restricting the cross-examination of a witness to one counsel.</blockquote>\n<p>The following week, respondent informed Fahle that he wanted Low to be his only attorney. Low then filed an application for admission <i>pro hac vice</i>. The District Court denied his application without comment. A month later, Low filed a second application, which the District Court again denied without explanation. Low's appeal, in the form of an application for a writ of mandamus, was dis- missed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</p>\n<p>Fahle filed a motion to withdraw as counsel and for a show-cause hearing to consider sanctions against Low. Fahle asserted that, by contacting respondent while re- spondent was represented by Fahle, Low violated Mo. Rule of Professional Conduct 4-4.2 (1993), which prohibits a lawyer \"[i]n representing a client\" from \"communi- cat[ing] about the subject of the representation with a party . . . represented by another lawyer\" without that lawyer's consent. Low filed a motion to strike Fahle's motion. The District Court granted Fahle's motion to withdraw and granted a continuance so that respondent could find new representation. Respondent retained a local attorney, Karl Dickhaus, for the trial. The District Court then denied Low's motion to strike and, for the first time, explained that it had denied Low's motions for ad- mission <i>pro hac vice</i> primarily because, in a separate case before it, Low had violated Rule 4-4.2 by communicating with a represented party.</p>\n<p>The case proceeded to trial, and Dickhaus represented respondent. Low again moved for admission and was again denied. The Court also denied Dickhaus's request to have Low at counsel table with him and ordered Low to sit in the audience and to have no contact with Dickhaus during the proceedings. To enforce the Court's order, a United States Marshal sat between Low and Dickhaus at trial. Respondent was unable to meet with Low through- out the trial, except for once on the last night. The jury found respondent guilty.</p>\n<p>After trial, the District Court granted Fahle's motion for sanctions against Low. It read Rule 4-4.2 to forbid Low's contact with respondent without Fahle's permission. It also reiterated that it had denied Low's motions for admis- sion on the ground that Low had violated the same Rule in a separate matter.</p>\n<p>Respondent appealed, and the Eighth Circuit vacated the conviction. 399 F. 3d 924 (2005). The Court first held that the District Court erred in interpreting Rule 4-4.2 to prohibit Low's conduct both in this case and in the sepa- rate matter on which the District Court based its denials of his admission motions. The District Court's denials of these motions were therefore erroneous and violated respondent's Sixth Amendment right to paid counsel of his choosing. See <i>id.</i>, at 928-932. The Court then concluded that this Sixth Amendment violation was not subject to harmless-error review. See <i>id.</i>, at 932-935. We granted certiorari. 546 U. S. ___ (2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The Sixth Amendment provides that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\" We have previ- ously held that an element of this right is the right of a defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him. See <i>Wheat</i> v. <i>United</i> <i>States,</i> 486 U. S. 153, 159 (1988). Cf. <i>Powell</i> v. <i>Alabama,</i> 287 U. S. 45, 53 (1932) (\"It is hardly necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afforded a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice\"). The Government here agrees, as it has previously, that \"the Sixth Amendment guarantees the defendant the right to be represented by an otherwise qualified attorney whom that defendant can afford to hire, or who is willing to represent the defendant even though he is without funds.\" <i>Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chartered</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 491 U. S. 617, 624-625 (1989). To be sure, the right to counsel of choice \"is circumscribed in several important respects.\" <i>Wheat</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 159. But the Government does not dispute the Eighth Circuit's conclusion in this case that the District Court erroneously deprived respondent of his counsel of choice.</p>\n<p>The Government contends, however, that the Sixth Amendment violation is not \"complete\" unless the defen- dant can show that substitute counsel was ineffective within the meaning of <i>Strickland</i> v. <i>Washington,</i> 466 U. S. 668, 691-696 (1984)\u0097<i>i.e.</i>, that substitute counsel's per- formance was deficient and the defendant was prejudiced by it. In the alternative, the Government contends that the defendant must at least demonstrate that his counsel of choice would have pursued a different strategy that would have created a \"reasonable probability that . . . the result of the proceedings would have been different,\" <i>id.</i>, at 694\u0097in other words, that he was prejudiced within the meaning of <i>Strickland</i> by the denial of his counsel of choice even if substitute counsel's performance was not constitutionally deficient.<sup>[1]</sup> To support these propositions, the Government points to our prior cases, which note that the right to counsel \"has been accorded . . . not for its own sake, but for the effect it has on the ability of the accused to receive a fair trial.\" <i>Mickens</i> v. <i>Taylor,</i> 535 U. S. 162, 166 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). A trial is not unfair and thus the Sixth Amendment is not violated, the Government reasons, unless a defendant has been prejudiced.</p>\n<p>Stated as broadly as this, the Government's argument in effect reads the Sixth Amendment as a more detailed version of the Due Process Clause\u0097and then proceeds to give no effect to the details. It is true enough that the purpose of the rights set forth in that Amendment is to ensure a fair trial; but it does not follow that the rights can be disregarded so long as the trial is, on the whole, fair. What the Government urges upon us here is what was urged upon us (successfully, at one time, see <i>Ohio</i> v. <i>Roberts</i>, 448 U. S. 56 (1980)) with regard to the Sixth Amendment's right of confrontation\u0097a line of reasoning that \"abstracts from the right to its purposes, and then eliminates the right.\" <i>Maryland</i> v. <i>Craig,</i> 497 U. S. 836, 862 (1990) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Since, it was argued, the purpose of the Confrontation Clause was to ensure the reliability of evidence, so long as the testimonial hearsay bore \"indicia of reliability,\" the Confrontation Clause was not violated. See <i>Roberts, supra,</i> at 65-66. We rejected that argument (and our prior cases that had accepted it) in <i>Crawford</i> v. <i>Washington</i>, 541 U. S. 36 (2004), saying that the Confrontation Clause \"commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 61.</p>\n<p>So also with the Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice. It commands, not that a trial be fair, but that a particular guarantee of fairness be provided\u0097to wit, that the accused be defended by the counsel he believes to be best. \"The Constitution guarantees a fair trial through the Due Process Clauses, but it defines the basic elements of a fair trial largely through the several provisions of the Sixth Amendment, including the Counsel Clause.\" <i>Strick-</i> <i>land, supra,</i> at 684-685. In sum, the right at stake here is the right to counsel of choice, not the right to a fair trial; and that right was violated because the deprivation of counsel was erroneous. No additional showing of preju- dice is required to make the violation \"complete.\"<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The cases the Government relies on involve the right to the effective assistance of counsel, the violation of which generally requires a defendant to establish prejudice. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Strickland, supra,</i> at 694; <i>Mickens</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 166; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Cronic</i>, 466 U. S. 648 (1984). The earliest case generally cited for the proposition that \"the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel,\" <i>McMann</i> v. <i>Richardson</i>, 397 U. S. 759, 771, n. 14 (1970), was based on the Due Process Clause rather than on the Sixth Amendment, see <i>Powell,</i> 287 U. S., at 57 (cited in <i>e.g., </i><i>McMann, supra,</i> at 771, n. 14). And even our recogni- tion of the right to effective counsel within the Sixth Amendment was a consequence of our perception that representation by counsel \"is critical to the ability of the adversarial system to produce just results.\" <i>Strickland</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 685. Having derived the right to effective repre- sentation from the purpose of ensuring a fair trial, we have, logically enough, also derived the limits of that right from that same purpose. See <i>Mickens, supra,</i> at 166. The requirement that a defendant show prejudice in effective representation cases arises from the very nature of the specific element of the right to counsel at issue there\u0097 <i>effective</i> (not mistake-free) representation. Counsel cannot be \"ineffective\" unless his mistakes have harmed the defense (or, at least, unless it is reasonably likely that they have). Thus, a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to <i>effective</i> representation is not \"complete\" until the defendant is prejudiced. See <i>Strickland</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 685.</p>\n<p>The right to select counsel of one's choice, by contrast, has never been derived from the Sixth Amendment's purpose of ensuring a fair trial.<sup>[3]</sup> It has been regarded as the root meaning of the constitutional guarantee. See <i>Wheat,</i> 486 U. S., at 159; <i>Andersen</i> v. <i>Treat</i>, 172 U. S. 24 (1898). See generally W. Beaney, The Right to Counsel in American Courts 18-24, 27-33 (1955). Cf. <i>Powell</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 53. Where the right to be assisted by counsel of one's choice is wrongly denied, therefore, it is unnecessary to conduct an ineffectiveness or prejudice inquiry to establish a Sixth Amendment violation. Deprivation of the right is \"complete\" when the defendant is erroneously prevented from being represented by the lawyer he wants, regardless of the quality of the representation he received. To argue otherwise is to confuse the right to counsel of choice\u0097 which is the right to a particular lawyer regardless of comparative effectiveness\u0097with the right to effective counsel\u0097which imposes a baseline requirement of compe- tence on whatever lawyer is chosen or appointed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Having concluded, in light of the Government's conces- sion of erroneous deprivation, that the trial court violated respondent's Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice, we must consider whether this error is subject to review for harmlessness. In <i>Arizona</i> v. <i>Fulminante</i>, 499 U. S. 279 (1991), we divided constitutional errors into two classes. The first we called \"trial error,\" because the errors \"oc- curred during presentation of the case to the jury\" and their effect may \"be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether [they were] harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Id.</i>, at 307-308 (internal quotation marks omitted). These in- clude \"most constitutional errors.\" <i>Id.</i>, at 306. The second class of constitutional error we called \"structural defects.\" These \"defy analysis by 'harmless-error' standards\" be- cause they \"affec[t] the framework within which the trial proceeds,\" and are not \"simply an error in the trial process itself.\" <i>Id.</i>, at 309-310.<sup>[4]</sup> See also <i>Neder</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 527 U. S. 1, 7-9 (1999). Such errors include the denial of counsel, see <i>Gideon</i> v. <i>Wainwright,</i> 372 U. S. 335 (1963), the denial of the right of self-representation, see <i>McKaskle</i> v. <i>Wiggins</i>, 465 U. S. 168, 177-178, n. 8 (1984), the denial of the right to public trial, see <i>Waller</i> v. <i>Georgia,</i> 467 U. S. 39, 49, n. 9 (1984), and the denial of the right to trial by jury by the giving of a defective reasonable-doubt instruction, see <i>Sullivan</i> v. <i>Louisiana,</i> 508 U. S. 275 (1993).</p>\n<p>We have little trouble concluding that erroneous depri- vation of the right to counsel of choice, \"with consequences that are necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate, unquestionably qualifies as 'structural error.'\" <i>Id.</i>, at 282. Different attorneys will pursue different strategies with regard to investigation and discovery, development of the theory of defense, selection of the jury, presentation of the witnesses, and style of witness examination and jury argument. And the choice of attorney will affect whether and on what terms the defendant cooperates with the prosecution, plea bargains, or decides instead to go to trial. In light of these myriad aspects of representation, the erroneous denial of counsel bears directly on the \"frame- work within which the trial proceeds,\" <i>Fulminante</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 310\u0097or indeed on whether it proceeds at all. It is impossible to know what different choices the rejected counsel would have made, and then to quantify the impact of those different choices on the outcome of the proceed- ings. Many counseled decisions, including those involving plea bargains and cooperation with the government, do not even concern the conduct of the trial at all. Harmless- error analysis in such a context would be a speculative inquiry into what might have occurred in an alternate universe.</p>\n<p>The Government acknowledges that the deprivation of choice of counsel pervades the entire trial, but points out that counsel's ineffectiveness may also do so and yet we do not allow reversal of a conviction for that reason without a showing of prejudice. But the requirement of showing prejudice in ineffectiveness claims stems from the very definition of the right at issue; it is not a matter of show- ing that the violation was harmless, but of showing that a violation of the right to effective representation <i>occurred</i>. A choice-of-counsel violation occurs <i>whenever</i> the defen- dant's choice is wrongfully denied. Moreover, if and when counsel's ineffectiveness \"pervades\" a trial, it does so (to the extent we can detect it) through identifiable mistakes. We can assess how those mistakes affected the outcome. To determine the effect of wrongful denial of choice of counsel, however, we would not be looking for mistakes committed by the actual counsel, but for differences in the defense that would have been made by the rejected coun- sel\u0097in matters ranging from questions asked on <i>voir dire</i> and cross-examination to such intangibles as argument style and relationship with the prosecutors. We would have to speculate upon what matters the rejected counsel would have handled differently\u0097or indeed, would have handled the same but with the benefit of a more jury- pleasing courtroom style or a longstanding relationship of trust with the prosecutors. And then we would have to speculate upon what effect those different choices or dif- ferent intangibles might have had. The difficulties of conducting the two assessments of prejudice are not re- motely comparable.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Nothing we have said today casts any doubt or places any qualification upon our previous holdings that limit the right to counsel of choice and recognize the authority of trial courts to establish criteria for admitting lawyers to argue before them. As the dissent too discusses, <i>post,</i> at 3, the right to counsel of choice does not extend to defendants who require counsel to be appointed for them. See <i>Wheat,</i> 486 U. S., at 159; <i>Caplin &amp; Drysdale</i>, 491 U. S., at 624, 626. Nor may a defendant insist on representation by a person who is not a member of the bar, or demand that a court honor his waiver of conflict-free representation. See <i>Wheat</i>, 486 U. S., at 159-160. We have recognized a trial court's wide latitude in balancing the right to counsel of choice against the needs of fairness, <i>id.</i>, at 163-164, and against the demands of its calendar, <i>Morris</i> v. <i>Slappy</i>, 461 U. S. 1, 11-12 (1983). The court has, moreover, an \"inde- pendent interest in ensuring that criminal trials are con- ducted within the ethical standards of the profession and that legal proceedings appear fair to all who observe them.\" <i>Wheat</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 160. None of these limitations on the right to choose one's counsel is relevant here. This is not a case about a court's power to enforce rules or adhere to practices that determine which attorneys may appear before it, or to make scheduling and other decisions that effectively exclude a defendant's first choice of counsel. However broad a court's discretion may be, the Govern- ment has conceded that the District Court here erred when it denied respondent his choice of counsel. Accept- ing that premise, we hold that the error violated respon- dent's Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice and that this violation is not subject to harmless-error analysis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE KENNEDY, and JUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I disagree with the Court's conclusion that a criminal conviction must automatically be reversed whenever a trial court errs in applying its rules regarding <i>pro hac vice</i> admissions and as a result prevents a defendant from being represented at trial by the defendant's first-choice attorney. Instead, a defendant should be required to make at least <i>some</i> showing that the trial court's erroneous ruling adversely affected the quality of assistance that the defendant received. In my view, the majority's contrary holding is based on an incorrect interpretation of the Sixth Amendment and a misapplication of harmless-error prin- ciples. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The majority makes a subtle but important mistake at the outset in its characterization of what the Sixth Amendment guarantees. The majority states that the Sixth Amendment protects \"the right of a defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him.\" <i>Ante</i>, at 3. What the Sixth Amendment actually protects, however, is the right to have <i>the assis-</i> <i>tance</i> that the defendant's counsel of choice is able to provide. It follows that if the erroneous disqualification of a defendant's counsel of choice does not impair the assis- tance that a defendant receives at trial, there is no viola- tion of the Sixth Amendment.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The language of the Sixth Amendment supports this interpretation. The Assistance of Counsel Clause focuses on what a defendant is entitled to receive (\"Assistance\"), rather than on the identity of the provider. The back- ground of the adoption of the Sixth Amendment points in the same direction. The specific evil against which the Assistance of Counsel Clause was aimed was the English common-law rule severely limiting a felony defendant's ability to be assisted by counsel. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Ash</i>, 413 U. S. 300, 306 (1973). \"[T]he core purpose of the counsel guarantee was to assure 'Assistance' at trial,\" <i>id.</i>, at 309, and thereby \"to assure fairness in the adversary criminal process,\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morrison</i>, 449 U. S. 361, 364 (1981). It was not \"the essential aim of the Amendment. . . to ensure that a defendant will inexorably be repre- sented by the lawyer whom he prefers.\" <i>Wheat</i> v. <i>United</i> <i>States</i>, 486 U. S. 153, 159 (1988); cf. <i>Morris</i> v. <i>Slappy</i>, 461 U. S. 1, 14 (1983) (\"[W]e reject the claim that the Sixth Amendment guarantees a 'meaningful relationship' be- tween an accused and his counsel\").</p>\n<p>There is no doubt, of course, that the right \"to have the Assistance of Counsel\" carries with it a limited right to be represented by counsel of choice. At the time of the adop- tion of the Bill of Rights, when the availability of ap- pointed counsel was generally limited,<sup>[2]</sup> that is how the right inevitably played out: A defendant's right to have the assistance of counsel necessarily meant the right to have the assistance of whatever counsel the defendant was able to secure. But from the beginning, the right to counsel of choice has been circumscribed.</p>\n<p>For one thing, a defendant's choice of counsel has al- ways been restricted by the rules governing admission to practice before the court in question. The Judiciary Act of 1789 made this clear, providing that parties \"in all the courts of the United States\" had the right to \"the assis- tance of such counsel or attorneys at law as by the rules of the said courts respectively shall be permitted to manage and conduct cases therein.\" Ch. 20, \u00a735, 1 Stat. 92. Therefore, if a defendant's first-choice attorney was not eligible to appear under the rules of a particular court, the defendant had no right to be represented by that attorney. Indeed, if a defendant's top 10 or top 25 choices were all attorneys who were not eligible to appear in the court in question, the defendant had no right to be represented by any of them. Today, rules governing admission to practice before particular courts continue to limit the ability of a criminal defendant to be represented by counsel of choice. See <i>Wheat,</i> 486 U. S., at 159.</p>\n<p>The right to counsel of choice is also limited by conflict- of-interest rules. Even if a defendant is aware that his or her attorney of choice has a conflict, and even if the defen- dant is eager to waive any objection, the defendant has no constitutional right to be represented by that attorney. See <i>id.</i>, at 159-160.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the right to be represented by counsel of choice can be limited by mundane case-management considerations. If a trial judge schedules a trial to begin on a particular date and defendant's counsel of choice is already committed for other trials until some time thereaf- ter, the trial judge has discretion under appropriate cir- cumstances to refuse to postpone the trial date and thereby, in effect, to force the defendant to forgo counsel of choice. See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Slappy</i>, <i>supra</i><i>; </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>Hughey</i>, 147 F. 3d 423, 428-431 (CA5 1998).</p>\n<p>These limitations on the right to counsel of choice are tolerable because the focus of the right is the quality of the representation that the defendant receives, not the iden- tity of the attorney who provides the representation. Limiting a defendant to those attorneys who are willing, available, and eligible to represent the defendant still leaves a defendant with a pool of attorneys to choose from\u0097and, in most jurisdictions today, a large and diverse pool. Thus, these restrictions generally have no adverse effect on a defendant's ability to secure the best assistance that the defendant's circumstances permit.</p>\n<p>Because the Sixth Amendment focuses on the quality of the assistance that counsel of choice would have provided, I would hold that the erroneous disqualification of counsel does not violate the Sixth Amendment unless the ruling diminishes the quality of assistance that the defendant would have otherwise received. This would not require a defendant to show that the second-choice attorney was constitutionally ineffective within the meaning of <i>Strick-</i> <i>land</i> v. <i>Washington</i>, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Rather, the defendant would be entitled to a new trial if the defendant could show \"an identifiable difference in the quality of representation between the disqualified counsel and the attorney who represents the defendant at trial.\" <i>Rodri-</i> <i>guez</i> v. <i>Chandler</i>, 382 F. 3d 670, 675 (CA7 2004), cert. denied, 543 U. S. 1156 (2005).</p>\n<p>This approach is fully consistent with our prior deci- sions. We have never held that the erroneous disqualifica- tion of counsel violates the Sixth Amendment when there is no prejudice, and while we have stated in several cases that the Sixth Amendment protects a defendant's right to counsel of choice, see <i>Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chartered</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 491 U. S. 617, 624-625 (1989); <i>Wheat</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 159; <i>Powell</i> v. <i>Alabama,</i> 287 U. S. 45, 53 (1932), we had no occasion in those cases to consider whether a violation of this right can be shown where there is no prejudice. Nor do our opinions in those cases refer to that question. It is therefore unreasonable to read our general statements regarding counsel of choice as addressing the issue of prejudice.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>But even accepting, as the majority holds, that the erroneous disqualification of counsel of choice always violates the Sixth Amendment, it still would not follow that reversal is required in all cases. The Constitution, by its terms, does not mandate any particular remedy for violations of its own provisions. Instead, we are bound in this case by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a), which instructs federal courts to \"disregar[d]\" \"[a]ny error. . . which does not affect substantial rights.\" See also 28 U. S. C. \u00a72111; <i>Chapman</i> v. <i>California,</i> 386 U. S. 18, 22 (1967). The only exceptions we have recognized to this rule have been for \"a limited class of fundamental consti- tutional errors that 'defy analysis by \"harmless error\" standards.'\" <i>Neder</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 527 U. S. 1, 7 (1999) (quoting <i>Arizona</i> v. <i>Fulminante,</i> 499 U. S. 279, 309 (1991)); see also <i>Chapman</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 23. \"Such errors . . . 'necessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair' [and] deprive defendants of 'basic protections' without which 'a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehi- cle for determination of guilt or innocence . . . and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.'\" <i>Neder</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 8-9 (quoting <i>Rose</i> v. <i>Clark,</i> 478 U. S. 570, 577-578 (1986) (second omission in original)); see also <i>ante</i>, at 9 (listing such errors).</p>\n<p>Thus, in <i>Neder</i>, we rejected the argument that the omis- sion of an element of a crime in a jury instruction \"<i>neces-</i> <i>sarily</i> render[s] a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence.\" 527 U. S., at 9. In fact, in that case, \"quite the opposite [was] true: Neder was tried before an impartial judge, under the correct standard of proof and with the assis- tance of counsel; a fairly selected, impartial jury was instructed to consider all of the evidence and argument in respect to Neder's defense . . . .\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Neder's situation\u0097with an impartial judge, the correct standard of proof, assistance of counsel, and a fair jury\u0097is much like respondent's. Fundamental unfairness does not inexorably follow from the denial of first-choice counsel. The \"decision to retain a particular lawyer\" is \"often unin- formed,\" <i>Cuyler</i> v. <i>Sullivan</i>, 446 U. S. 335, 344 (1980); a defendant's second-choice lawyer may thus turn out to be better than the defendant's first-choice lawyer. More often, a defendant's first- and second-choice lawyers may be simply indistinguishable. These possibilities would not justify violating the right to choice of counsel, but they do make me hard put to characterize the violation as \"<i>always</i> render[ing] a trial unfair,\" <i>Neder</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 9. Fairness may not limit the right, see <i>ante</i>, at 5, but it does inform the remedy.</p>\n<p>Nor is it always or nearly always impossible to deter- mine whether the first choice would have provided better representation than the second choice. There are un- doubtedly cases in which the prosecution would have little difficulty showing that the second-choice attorney was better qualified than or at least as qualified as the defen- dant's initial choice, and there are other cases in which it will be evident to the trial judge that any difference in ability or strategy could not have possibly affected the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p>Requiring a defendant to fall back on a second-choice attorney is not comparable to denying a defendant the right to be represented by counsel at all. Refusing to permit a defendant to receive the assistance of any counsel is the epitome of fundamental unfairness, and as far as the effect on the outcome is concerned, it is much more difficult to assess the effect of a complete denial of counsel than it is to assess the effect of merely preventing repre- sentation by the defendant's first-choice attorney. To be sure, when the effect of an erroneous disqualification is hard to gauge, the prosecution will be unable to meet its burden of showing that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. But that does not justify eliminating the possibility of showing harmless error in all cases.</p>\n<p>The majority's focus on the \"trial error\"/\"structural defect\" dichotomy is misleading. In <i>Fulminante</i>, we used these terms to denote two poles of constitutional error that had appeared in prior cases; trial errors always lead to harmless-error review, while structural defects always lead to automatic reversal. See 499 U. S., at 306-310. We did not suggest that trial errors are the <i>only</i> sorts of errors amenable to harmless-error review, or that <i>all</i> errors \"affecting the framework within which the trial proceeds,\" <i>id.</i>, at 310, are structural. The touchstone of structural error is fundamental unfairness and unreliability. Auto- matic reversal is strong medicine that should be reserved for constitutional errors that \"<i>always</i>\" or \"<i>necessarily</i>,\" <i>Neder</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 9 (emphasis in original), produce such unfairness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Either of the two courses outlined above\u0097requiring at least some showing of prejudice, or engaging in harmless- error review\u0097would avoid the anomalous and unjustifi- able consequences that follow from the majority's two-part rule of error without prejudice followed by automatic reversal.</p>\n<p>Under the majority's holding, a defendant who is erro- neously required to go to trial with a second-choice attor- ney is automatically entitled to a new trial even if this attorney performed brilliantly. By contrast, a defendant whose attorney was ineffective in the constitutional sense (<i>i.e.</i>, \"made errors so serious that counsel was not func- tioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed . . . by the Sixth Amendment,\" <i>Strickland</i>, 466 U. S., at 687) cannot obtain relief without showing prejudice.</p>\n<p>Under the majority's holding, a trial court may adopt rules severely restricting <i>pro hac vice</i> admissions, cf. <i>Leis</i> v. <i>Flynt</i>, 439 U. S. 438, 443 (1979) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> but if it adopts a generous rule and then errs in interpreting or applying it, the error automatically requires reversal of any conviction, regardless of whether the erroneous ruling had any effect on the defendant.</p>\n<p>Under the majority's holding, some defendants will be awarded new trials even though it is clear that the errone- ous disqualification of their first-choice counsel did not prejudice them in the least. Suppose, for example, that a defendant is initially represented by an attorney who previously represented the defendant in civil matters and who has little criminal experience. Suppose that this attorney is erroneously disqualified and that the defen- dant is then able to secure the services of a nationally acclaimed and highly experienced criminal defense attor- ney who secures a surprisingly favorable result at trial\u0097 for instance, acquittal on most but not all counts. Under the majority's holding, the trial court's erroneous ruling automatically means that the Sixth Amendment was violated\u0097even if the defendant makes no attempt to argue that the disqualified attorney would have done a better job. In fact, the defendant would still be entitled to a new trial on the counts of conviction even if the defendant publicly proclaimed after the verdict that the second at- torney had provided better representation than any other attorney in the country could have possibly done.</p>\n<p>Cases as stark as the above hypothetical are unlikely, but there are certainly cases in which the erroneous dis- qualification of a defendant's first-choice counsel neither seriously upsets the defendant's preferences nor impairs the defendant's representation at trial. As noted above, a defendant's second-choice lawyer may sometimes be better than the defendant's first-choice lawyer. Defendants who retain counsel are frequently forced to choose among attorneys whom they do not know and about whom they have limited information, and thus a defendant may not have a strong preference for any one of the candidates. In addition, if all of the attorneys considered charge roughly comparable fees, they may also be roughly comparable in experience and ability. Under these circumstances, the erroneous disqualification of a defendant's first-choice attorney may simply mean that the defendant will be represented by an attorney whom the defendant very nearly chose initially and who is able to provide represen- tation that is just as good as that which would have been furnished by the disqualified attorney. In light of these realities, mandating reversal without even a minimal showing of prejudice on the part of the defendant is unwarranted.</p>\n<p>The consequences of the majority's holding are particu- larly severe in the federal system and in other court sys- tems that do not allow a defendant to take an interlocu- tory appeal when counsel is disqualified. See <i>Flanagan</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 465 U. S. 259, 260 (1984). Under such systems, appellate review typically occurs after the defen- dant has been tried and convicted. At that point, if an appellate court concludes that the trial judge made a marginally incorrect ruling in applying its own <i>pro hac</i> <i>vice</i> rules, the appellate court has no alternative but to order a new trial\u0097even if there is not even any claim of prejudice. The Sixth Amendment does not require such results.</p>\n<p>Because I believe that some showing of prejudice is required to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment, I would vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals determine whether there was prejudice. However, assum- ing for the sake of argument that no prejudice is required, I believe that such a violation, like most constitutional violations, is amenable to harmless-error review. Our statutes demand it, and our precedents do not bar it. I would then vacate and remand to let the Court of Appeals determine whether the error was harmless in this case.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The dissent proposes yet a third standard\u0097viz., that the defendant must show \" 'an identifiable difference in the quality of representation between the disqualified counsel and the attorney who represents the defendant at trial.'\" <i>Post,</i> at 4 (opinion of ALITO, J.). That proposal suffers from the same infirmities (outlined later in text) that beset the Government's positions. In addition, however, it greatly impairs the clarity of the law. How is a lower-court judge to know what an \"identi- fiable difference\" consists of? Whereas the Government at least appeals to <i>Strickland</i> and the case law under it, the most the dissent can claim by way of precedential support for its rule is that it is \"consistent with\" cases that never discussed the issue of prejudice. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[2]  The dissent resists giving effect to our cases' recognition, and the Government's concession, that a defendant has a right to be defended by counsel of his choosing. It argues that because the Sixth Amend- ment guarantees the right to the \"assistance of counsel,\" it is not violated unless \"the erroneous disqualification of a defendant's counsel of choice . . . impair[s] the assistance that a defendant receives at trial.\" <i>Post,</i> at 1-2 (opinion of ALITO, J.). But if our cases (and the Govern- ment's concession) mean anything, it is that the Sixth Amendment is violated when the erroneous disqualification of counsel \"impair[s] the assistance that a defendant receives at trial <i>[from the counsel that he</i> <i>chose].\"</i></p>\n<p>[3]  In <i>Wheat</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 486 U. S. 153 (1988), where we formu- lated the right to counsel of choice and discussed some of the limita- tions upon it, we took note of the overarching purpose of fair trial in holding that the trial court has discretion to disallow a first choice of counsel that would create serious risk of conflict of interest. <i>Id.,</i> at 159. It is one thing to conclude that the right to counsel of choice may be limited by the need for fair trial, but quite another to say that the right does not exist unless its denial renders the trial unfair.</p>\n<p>[4]  The dissent criticizes us for our trial error/structural defect dichot- omy, asserting that <i>Fulminante</i> never said that \"trial errors are the <i>only</i> sorts of errors amenable to harmless-error review, or that <i>all</i> errors affecting the framework within which the trial proceeds are structural,\" <i>post,</i> at 8 (opinion of ALITO, J.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although it is hard to read that case as doing anything other than dividing constitutional error into two comprehen- sive categories, our ensuing analysis in fact relies neither upon such comprehensiveness nor upon trial error as the touchstone for the availability of harmless-error review. Rather, here, as we have done in the past, we rest our conclusion of structural error upon the difficulty of assessing the effect of the error. See <i>Waller</i> v. <i>Georgia,</i> 467 U. S. 39, 49, n. 9 (1984) (violation of the public-trial guarantee is not subject to harmlessness review because \"the benefits of a public trial are fre- quently intangible, difficult to prove, or a matter of chance\"); <i>Vasquez</i> v. <i>Hillery,</i> 474 U. S. 254, 263 (1986) (\"[W]hen a petit jury has been selected upon improper criteria or has been exposed to prejudicial publicity, we have required reversal of the conviction because the effect of the viola- tion cannot be ascertained\"). The dissent would use \"fundamental unfairness\" as the sole criterion of structural error, and cites a case in which that was the determining factor, see <i>Neder</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 527 U. S. 1, 9 (1999) (quoted by the dissent, <i>post,</i> at 6). But this has not been the only criterion we have used. In addition to the above cases using difficulty of assessment as the test, we have also relied on the irrelevance of harmlessness, see <i>McKaskle</i> v. <i>Wiggins,</i> 465 U. S. 168, 177, n. 8 (1984) (\"Since the right to self-representation is a right that when exercised usually increases the likelihood of a trial outcome unfavor- able to the defendant, its denial is not amenable to 'harmless error' analysis\"). Thus, it is the dissent that creates a single, inflexible criterion, inconsistent with the reasoning of our precedents, when it asserts that <i>only</i> those errors that <i>always</i> or <i>necessarily</i> render a trial fundamentally unfair and unreliable are structural, <i>post,</i> at 8.</p>\n<p>[5]  In its discussion of the analysis that would be required to conduct harmless-error review, the dissent focuses on which counsel was \"better.\" See <i>post,</i> at 7-8 (opinion of ALITO, J.). This focus has the effect of making the analysis look achievable, but it is fundamentally inconsistent with the principle (which the dissent purports to accept for the sake of argument) that the Sixth Amendment can be violated without a showing of harm to the quality of representation. Cf. <i>McKaskle, supra,</i> at 177, n. 8. By framing its inquiry in these terms and expressing indignation at the thought that a defendant may receive a new trial when his actual counsel was at least as effective as the one he wanted, the dissent betrays its misunderstanding of the nature of the right to counsel of choice and its confusion of this right with the right to effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p>[1]  This view is consistent with the Government's concession that \"[t]he Sixth Amendment . . . encompasses a non-indigent defendant's right to select counsel who will represent him in a criminal prosecution,\" Brief for United States 11, though this right is \"circumscribed in several important respects,\" <i>id.</i>, at 12 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>[2]  See Act of Apr. 30, 1790, ch. 9, \u00a729, 1 Stat. 118 (providing for ap- pointment of counsel in capital cases); <i>Betts</i> v. <i>Brady</i>, 316 U. S. 455, 467, n. 20 (1942) (surveying state statutes).</p>\n<p>[3]  <i>Powell</i> is the case generally cited as first noting a defendant's right to counsel of choice. <i>Powell</i> involved an infamous trial in which the defendants were prevented from obtaining any counsel of their choice and were instead constrained to proceed with court-appointed counsel of dubious effectiveness. We held that this denied them due process and that \"a fair opportunity to secure counsel of [one's] own choice\" is a necessary concomitant of the right to counsel. 287 U. S., at 53; cf. <i>id.</i>, at 71 (\"[T]he failure of the trial court to give [petitioners] reasonable time and opportunity to secure counsel was a clear denial of due proc- ess\"). It is clear from the facts of the case that we were referring to the denial of the opportunity to choose <i>any</i> counsel, and we certainly said nothing to suggest that a violation of the right to counsel of choice could be established without any showing of prejudice.\n</p>\n<p>In <i>Wheat</i>, we held that the trial judge had not erred in declining the defendant's waiver of his right to conflict-free counsel, and therefore we had no need to consider whether an incorrect ruling would have re- quired reversal of the defendant's conviction in the absence of a show- ing of prejudice. We noted that \"the right to select and be represented by one's preferred attorney is comprehended by the Sixth Amendment,\" 486 U. S., at l59, but we went on to stress that this right \"is circum- scribed in several important respects,\" <i>ibid</i>., including by the require- ment of bar membership and rules against conflicts of interest. <i>Wheat</i> did not suggest that a violation of the limited Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice can be established without showing prejudice, and our statements about the Sixth Amendment's \"purpose\" and \"essential aim\"\u0097providing effective advocacy and a fair trial, <i>ibid.</i>\u0097suggest the opposite.</p>\n<p>Finally, in <i>Caplin &amp; Drysdale</i>, we held that the challenged action of the trial judge\u0097entering an order forfeiting funds that the defendant had earmarked for use in paying his attorneys\u0097had been proper, and, accordingly, we had no occasion to address the issue of prejudice. We recognized that \"the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to be represented by an otherwise qualified attorney whom that defendant can afford to hire, or who is willing to represent the defen- dant even though he is without funds,\" 491 U. S., at 624-625, but we added that \"[w]hatever the full extent of the Sixth Amendment's protection of one's right to retain counsel of his choosing, that protec- tion does not go beyond 'the individual's right to spend his own money to obtain the advice and assistance of . . . counsel,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 626 (omission in original).</p>\n\n</div>",
