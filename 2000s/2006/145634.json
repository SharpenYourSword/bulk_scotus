The process consists of using any test (whether patented or unpatented) to measure the level in a body fluid of an amino acid called homocysteine and then noticing whether its level is elevated above the norm; if so, a vitamin deficiency is likely.</p>\n<p>The lower courts held that the patent claim is valid. They also found the petitioner, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LabCorp), liable for inducing infringe- ment of the claim when it encouraged doctors to order diagnostic tests for measuring homocysteine. The courts assessed damages. And they enjoined LabCorp from using any tests that would lead the doctors it serves to find a vitamin deficiency by taking account of elevated homocys- teine levels.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari in this case to determine whether the patent claim is invalid on the ground that it improp- erly seeks to \"claim a monopoly over a basic scientific relationship,\" Pet. for Cert. i, namely, the relationship between homocysteine and vitamin deficiency. The Court has dismissed the writ as improvidently granted. In my view, we should not dismiss the writ. The question pre- sented is not unusually difficult. We have the authority to decide it. We said that we would do so. The parties and <i>amici</i> have fully briefed the question. And those who en- gage in medical research, who practice medicine, and who as patients depend upon proper health care, might well benefit from this Court's authoritative answer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The relevant principle of law \"[e]xclude[s] from . . . patent protection . . . laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas.\" <i>Diamond</i> v. <i>Diehr,</i> 450 U. S. 175, 185 (1981). This principle finds its roots in both English and American law. See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Neilson</i> v. <i>Harford</i>, Webster's Patent Cases 295, 371 (1841); <i>Le Roy</i> v. <i>Tatham,</i> 14 How. 156. 175 (1853); <i>O'Reilly</i> v. <i>Morse</i>, 15 How. 62 (1854); <i>The</i> <i>Telephone Cases,</i> 126 U. S. 1 (1888). The principle means that Einstein could not have \"patent[ed] his celebrated law that E=mc2; nor could Newton have patented the law of gravity.\" <i>Diamond</i> v. <i>Chakrabarty</i>, 447 U. S. 303, 309 (1980). Neither can one patent \"a novel and useful mathematical formula,\" <i>Parker</i> v. <i>Flook</i>, 437 U. S. 584, 585 (1978), the motive power of electromagnetism or steam, <i>Morse, supra,</i> at 116, \"the heat of the sun, electric- ity, or the qualities of metals,\" <i>Funk Brothers Seed Co.</i> v. <i>Kalo Inoculant Co.,</i> 333 U. S. 127, 130 (1948).</p>\n<p>The justification for the principle does not lie in any claim that \"laws of nature\" are obvious, or that their dis- covery is easy, or that they are not useful. To the con- trary, research into such matters may be costly and time- consuming; monetary incentives may matter; and the fruits of those incentives and that research may prove of great benefit to the human race. Rather, the reason for the exclusion is that sometimes <i>too much</i> patent protec- tion can impede rather than \"promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts,\" the constitutional objective of patent and copyright protection. U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 8.</p>\n<p>The problem arises from the fact that patents do not only encourage research by providing monetary incentives for invention. Sometimes their presence can discourage research by impeding the free exchange of information, for example by forcing researchers to avoid the use of poten- tially patented ideas, by leading them to conduct costly and time-consuming searches of existing or pending pat- ents, by requiring complex licensing arrangements, and by raising the costs of using the patented information, some- times prohibitively so.</p>\n<p>Patent law seeks to avoid the dangers of overprotection just as surely as it seeks to avoid the diminished incentive to invent that underprotection can threaten. One way in which patent law seeks to sail between these opposing and risky shoals is through rules that bring certain types of invention and discovery within the scope of patentability while excluding others. And scholars have noted that \"patent law['s] exclu[sion of] fundamental scientific (in- cluding mathematical) and technological principles,\" (like copyright's exclusion of \"ideas\") is a rule of the latter variety. W. Landes &amp; R. Posner, The Economic Structure of Intellectual Property Law 305 (2003). That rule reflects \"both . . . the enormous potential for rent seeking that would be created if property rights could be obtained in [those basic principles] and . . . the enormous transaction costs that would be imposed on would-be users.\" <i>Id</i>., at 305-306; cf. <i>Nichols</i> v. <i>Universal Pictures Corp.</i>, 45 F. 2d 119, 122 (CA2 1930) (L. Hand, J.).</p>\n<p>Thus, the Court has recognized that \"[p]henomena of nature, though just discovered, mental processes, and abstract intellectual concepts are . . . the basic tools of scientific and technological work.\" <i>Gottschalk</i> v. <i>Benson,</i> 409 U. S. 63, 67 (1972). It has treated fundamental scien- tific principles as \"part of the storehouse of knowledge\" and manifestations of laws of nature as \"free to all men and reserved exclusively to none.\" <i>Funk Bros.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 130. And its doing so reflects a basic judgment that pro- tection in such cases, despite its potentially positive incen- tive effects, would too often severely interfere with, or discourage, development and the further spread of useful knowledge itself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In the 1980s three university doctors, after conducting research into vitamin deficiencies, found a correlation between high levels of homocysteine in the blood and deficiencies of two essential vitamins, folate (folic acid) and cobalamin (vitamin B12). They also developed more accurate methods for testing body fluids for homocysteine, using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. They published their findings in 1985. They obtained a patent. And that patent eventually found its commercial way into the hands of Competitive Technologies, Inc. (CTI), and its licensee Metabolite Laboratories, Inc. (Metabolite), the respondents here.</p>\n<p>The patent contains several claims that cover the re- searchers' new methods for testing homocysteine levels using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Supp. App. 30. In 1991, LabCorp (in fact, a corporate predeces- sor) took a license from Metabolite permitting it to use the tests described in the patent in return for 27.5% of related revenues. Their agreement permitted LabCorp to termi- nate the arrangement if \"a more cost effective commercial alternative is available <i>that does not infringe a valid and</i> <i>enforceable claim</i> of\" the patent. App. 305 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Until 1998, LabCorp used the patented tests and paid royalties. By that time, however, growing recognition that elevated homocysteine levels might predict risk of heart disease led to increased testing demand. Other companies began to produce alternative testing procedures. And LabCorp decided to use one of these other procedures\u0097a test devised by Abbott Laboratories that LabCorp con- cluded was \"far superior.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 167 (testimony of Peter Wentz).</p>\n<p>LabCorp continued to pay royalties to respondents whenever it used the patented tests. But it concluded that Abbott's test did not fall within the patent's protective scope. And LabCorp consequently refused to pay royalties when it used the Abbott test. <i>Id.,</i> at 237 (payment elimi- nated due to \"change in methodology\").</p>\n<p>In response, respondents brought this suit against LabCorp for patent infringement and breach of the license agreement. They did not claim that LabCorp's use of the Abbott test infringed the patent's claims describing meth- ods for testing for homocysteine. Instead, respondents relied on a broader claim not limited to those tests, namely claim 13, the sole claim at issue here. That claim\u0097set forth below in its entirety\u0097seeks patent protection for:</p>\n<blockquote>\"A method for detecting a deficiency of cobalamin or folate in warm-blooded animals comprising the steps of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"assaying a body fluid for an elevated level of total homocysteine; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"correlating an elevated level of total homocysteine in said body fluid with a deficiency of cobalamin or folate.\" Supp. App. 30.</blockquote>\n<p>Claim 13, respondents argued, created a protected monopoly over the process of \"correlating\" test results and potential vitamin deficiencies. The parties agreed that the words \"assaying a body fluid\" refer to the use of any test at all, whether patented or not patented, that determines whether a body fluid has an \"elevated level of total homo- cysteine.\" And at trial, the inventors testified that claim 13's \"correlating\" step consists simply of a physician's recognizing that a test that shows an elevated homocys- teine level\u0097by that very fact\u0097shows the patient likely has a cobalamin or folate deficiency. App. 108-111 (testi- mony of Dr. Sally Stabler); <i>id.,</i> at 131-148 (testimony of Robert Allen). They added that, because the natural relationship between homocysteine and vitamin deficiency was now well known, such \"correlating\" would occur automatically in the mind of any competent physician. <i>Id.,</i> at 137-138 (same).</p>\n<p>On this understanding of the claim, respondents argued, LabCorp was liable for inducing doctors to infringe. More specifically, LabCorp would conduct homocysteine tests and report the results measured in micromoles (millionths of a mole) per liter (symbolized \u00b5mol/L). Doctors, because of their training, would know that a normal homocysteine range in blood is between 7 and 22 \u00b5mol/L (and in urine between 1 and 20 \u00b5mol/L), Supp. App. 14, and would know that an elevated homocysteine level is correlated with a vitamin deficiency. Hence, in reviewing the test results, doctors would look at the \u00b5mol/L measure and automati- cally reach a conclusion about whether or not a person was suffering from a vitamin deficiency. Claim 13 therefore covered <i>every</i> homocysteine test that a doctor reviewed. And since LabCorp had advertised its tests and educated doctors about the correlation, LabCorp should be liable for actively inducing the doctors' infringing acts. See 35 U. S. C. \u00a7271(b).</p>\n<p>The jury found LabCorp liable on this theory. The District Court calculated damages based on unpaid royal- ties for some 350,000 homocysteine tests performed by LabCorp using the Abbott method. The court also en- joined LabCorp from performing \"any homocysteine-only test, including, without limitation homocysteine-only tests via the Abbott method.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a-37a (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>LabCorp appealed. It argued to the Federal Circuit that the trial court was wrong to construe claim 13 so broadly that infringement took place \"every time a physician does nothing more than look at a patient's homocysteine level.\" Corrected Brief for Appellant in No. 03-1120 (CA Fed.), p. 28 (hereinafter Brief for Appellant). Indeed, if so con- strued (rather than construed, say, to cover only <i>patented</i> tests), then claim 13 was \"invalid for indefiniteness, lack of written description, non-enablement, anticipation, and obviousness.\" <i>Id</i>., at 38. LabCorp told the Federal Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote>\"If the Court were to uphold this vague claim, anyone could obtain a patent on any scientific correlation\u0097 that there is a link between fact A and fact B\u0097merely by drafting a patent claiming no more than 'test for fact A and correlate with fact B' . . . . Claim 13 does no more than that. If it is upheld, CTI would improp- erly gain a monopoly over a basic scientific fact rather than any novel invention of its own. The law is set- tled that no such claim should be allowed. <i>See, e.g.,</i> <i>Diamond</i> v. <i>Diehr,</i> 450 U. S. 175 (1981); . . . Chisum on Patents \u00a71.03[6].\" <i>Id</i>., at 41.</blockquote>\n<p>The Federal Circuit rejected LabCorp's arguments. It agreed with the District Court that claim 13's \"correlating\" step simply means \"relating total homocysteine levels to cobalamin or folate deficiency, a deficiency in both, or a deficiency in neither.\" 370 F. 3d 1354, 1363 (2004). That meaning, it said, is \"discernable and clear\"; it is definite, it is described in writing, and it would enable virtually anyone to follow the instruction it gives. And that is sufficient. <i>Id</i>., at 1366-1367. The Court did not address LabCorp's argument that, <i>if so construed</i>, claim 13 must be struck down as an improper effort to obtain patent protection for a law of nature.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Circuit concluded, because any competent doctor reviewing test results would automatically correlate those results with the presence or absence of a vitamin deficiency, virtually every doctor who ordered and read the tests was a direct infringer. And because LabCorp \"pub- lishes . . . Continuing Medical Education articles\" and other pieces, which urge doctors to conduct the relevant tests and to reach a conclusion about whether a patient is suffering from a vitamin deficiency based upon the test results, LabCorp induces infringement. <i>Id.</i>, at 1365. Finally, the court rejected LabCorp's challenge to the injunction. <i>Id</i>., at 1372.</p>\n<p>LabCorp filed a petition for certiorari. Question Three of the petition asks \"[w]hether a method patent . . . direct- ing a party simply to 'correlate' test results can validly claim a monopoly over a basic scientific relationship . . . such that any doctor necessarily infringes the patent merely by thinking about the relationship after looking at a test result.\" Pet. for Cert. i. After calling for and receiv- ing the views of the Solicitor General, 543 U. S. 1185 (2005), we granted the petition, limited to Question Three.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The question before us is whether claim 13, as construed and applied in the way I have described in Part I\u0097B, is invalid in light of the \"law of nature\" principle, described in Part I\u0097A. I believe that we should answer that ques- tion. There is a technical procedural reason for not doing so, namely, that LabCorp did not refer in the lower courts to \u00a7101 of the Patent Act, which sets forth subject matter that is patentable, and within the bounds of which the \"law of nature\" principle most comfortably fits. See 35 U. S. C. \u00a7101 (patent may be obtained for \"any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter\"); <i>Flook,</i> 437 U. S., at 588-589. There is also a practical reason for not doing so, namely, that we might benefit from the views of the Federal Circuit, which did not directly consider the question. See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Bestfoods,</i> 524 U. S. 51, 72-73 (1998).</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, stronger considerations argue for our reaching a decision. For one thing, the technical proce- dural objection is tenuous. LabCorp argued the essence of its present claim below. It told the Federal Circuit that claim 13 as construed by the District Court was too \"vague\" because that construction would allow \"anyone\" to \"obtain a patent on any scientific correlation;\" it would permit the respondents \"improperly [to] gain a monopoly over a basic scientific fact\" despite \"settled\" law \"that no such claim should be allowed.\" Brief for Appellant 41 (citing <i>Diehr,</i> 450 U. S., at 1185; 1 D. Chisum, Patents \u00a71.03[6]) (2006 ed.) (hereinafter Chisum). LabCorp explic- itly stated in its petition for certiorari that, \"if the Court allows the Federal Circuit opinion to stand . . . [respon- dents] would improperly gain monopolies over basic scien- tific facts rather than any novel inventions of their own.\" Pet. for Cert. 25 (citing <i>Diehr</i>, <i>supra</i><i>; </i><i>Gottschalk,</i> 409 U. S. 63; <i>Funk Bros.,</i> 333 U. S. 127; <i>Mackay Radio &amp; Telegraph</i> <i>Co.</i> v. <i>Radio Corp. of America,</i> 306 U. S. 86 (1939)). And after considering the Solicitor General's advice not to hear the case (primarily based upon LabCorp's failure to refer to 35 U. S. C. \u00a7101), we rejected that advice, thereby \"nec- essarily consider[ing] and reject[ing] that contention as a basis for denying review.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Williams,</i> 504 U. S. 36, 40 (1992).</p>\n<p>For another thing, I can find no good practical reason for refusing to decide the case. The relevant issue has been fully briefed and argued by the parties, the Government, and 20 <i>amici</i>. The record is comprehensive, allowing us to learn the precise nature of the patent claim, to consider the commercial and medical context (which the parties and <i>amici</i> have described in detail), and to become famil- iar with the arguments made in all courts. Neither the factual record nor the briefing suffers from any significant gap. No party has identified any prejudice due to our answering the question. And there is no indication that LabCorp's failure to cite \u00a7101 reflected unfair gamesmanship.</p>\n<p>Of course, further consideration by the Federal Circuit might help us reach a better decision. Lower court consid- eration almost always helps. But the thoroughness of the briefing leads me to conclude that the extra time, cost, and uncertainty that further proceedings would engender are not worth the potential benefit.</p>\n<p>Finally, I believe that important considerations of the public interest\u0097including that of clarifying the law in this area sooner rather than later\u0097argue strongly for our deciding the question presented now. See Part IV, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>I turn to the merits. The researchers who obtained the present patent found that an elevated level of homocys- teine in a warm-blooded animal is correlated with folate and cobalamin deficiencies. As construed by the Federal Circuit, claim 13 provides those researchers with control over doctors' efforts to use that correlation to diagnose vitamin deficiencies in a patient. Does the law permit such protection or does claim 13, in the circumstances, amount to an invalid effort to patent a \"phenomenon of nature\"?</p>\n<p>I concede that the category of non-patentable \"phenom- ena of nature,\" like the categories of \"mental processes,\" and \"abstract intellectual concepts,\" is not easy to define. See <i>Flook, supra</i>, at 589 (\"The line between a patentable 'process' and an unpatentable 'principle' is not always clear\"); cf. <i>Nichols</i>, 45 F. 2d, at 122 (\"[W]e are as aware as anyone that the line [between copyrighted material and non-copyrightable ideas], wherever it is drawn, will seem arbitrary\"). After all, many a patentable invention rests upon its inventor's knowledge of natural phenomena; many \"process\" patents seek to make abstract intellectual concepts workably concrete; and all conscious human action involves a mental process. See generally 1 Chisum \u00a71.03, at 78-295. Nor can one easily use such abstract categories directly to distinguish instances of likely benefi- cial, from likely harmful, forms of protection. Cf. FTC, To Promote Innovation: The Proper Balance of Competition and Patent Law and Policy, ch. 3, p. 1 (Oct. 2003) (herein- after FTC) (collecting evidence that \"issues of fixed cost recovery, alternative appropriability mechanisms, and relationships between initial and follow-on innovation\" vary by industry); Burk &amp; Lemley, Policy Levers in Patent Law, 89 Va. L. Rev. 1575, 1577-1589 (2003) (\"Recent evidence has demonstrated that this complex relationship [between patents and innovation] is . . . industry-specific at each stage of the patent process\").</p>\n<p>But this case is not at the boundary. It does not require us to consider the precise scope of the \"natural phenome- non\" doctrine or any other difficult issue. In my view, claim 13 is invalid no matter how narrowly one reasonably interprets that doctrine.</p>\n<p>There can be little doubt that the correlation between homocysteine and vitamin deficiency set forth in claim 13 is a \"natural phenomenon.\" That is what the petitioners argue. It is what the Solicitor General has told us. Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 19 (filed Dec. 23, 2005) (\"The natural relationship between elevated homocysteine and deficiencies in the B vitamins is an unpatentable 'principle in natural philosophy or physical science'\") (quoting <i>Morse</i>, 15 How., at 116)). Indeed, it is close to what the respondents concede. Brief for Respondents 31 (\"The correlation between total homocysteine and deficien- cies in cobalamin and folate that the Inventors discovered could be considered, standing alone, a 'natural phenome- non' in the literal sense: It is an observable aspect of bio- chemistry in at least some human populations\").</p>\n<p>The respondents argue, however, that the correlation is nonetheless patentable because claim 13 packages it in the form of a \"process\" for detecting vitamin deficiency, with discrete testing and correlating steps. They point to this Court's statements that a \"process is not unpatentable simply because it contains a law of nature,\" <i>Flook</i>, 437 U. S., at 590; see also <i>Gottschalk</i>, 409 U. S., at 67, and that \"an <i>application</i> of a law of nature . . . to a known . . . process may well be deserving of patent protection.\" <i>Diehr,</i> 450 U. S., at 187<i>.</i> They add that claim 13 is a patentable \"application of a law of nature\" because, con- sidered as a whole, it (1) \"entails a physical transforma- tion of matter,\" namely, the alteration of a blood sample during whatever test is used, Brief for Respondents 33 (citing <i>Cochrane</i> v. <i>Deener,</i> 94 U. S. 780, 788 (1877); <i>Gottschalk, supra,</i> at 70), and because it (2) \"produces a 'useful, concrete, and tangible result,'\" namely, detection of a vitamin deficiency, Brief for Respondents 36 (citing <i>State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co.</i> v. <i>Signature Financial</i> <i>Group, Inc.</i>, 149 F. 3d 1368, 1373 (CA Fed 1998)).</p>\n<p>In my view, however, the cases to which respondents refer do not support their claim. Neither <i>Cochrane</i> nor <i>Gottschalk</i> can help them because the process described in claim 13 is <i>not</i> a process for transforming blood or any other matter. Claim 13's process instructs the user to (1) obtain test results and (2) think about them. Why should it matter if the test results themselves were obtained through an unpatented procedure that involved the trans- formation of blood? Claim 13 is indifferent to that fact, for it tells the user to use any test at all. Indeed, to use virtu- ally any natural phenomenon for virtually any useful purpose could well involve the use of empirical informa- tion obtained through an unpatented means that might have involved transforming matter. Neither <i>Cochrane</i> nor <i>Gottschalk</i> suggests that that fact renders the phenome- non patentable. See <i>Cochrane, supra</i>, at 785 (upholding process for improving quality of flour by removing impuri- ties with blasts of air); <i>Gottschalk, supra</i>, at 71-73 (reject- ing process for converting numerals to binary form through mathematical formula).</p>\n<p>Neither does the Federal Circuit's decision in <i>State</i> <i>Street Bank</i> help respondents. That case does say that a process is patentable if it produces a \"useful, concrete, and tangible result.\" 149 F. 3d, at 1373. But this Court has never made such a statement and, if taken literally, the statement would cover instances where this Court has held the contrary. The Court, for example, has invalidated a claim to the use of electromagnetic current for transmit- ting messages over long distances even though it produces a result that seems \"useful, concrete, and tangible.\" <i>Morse, supra</i>, at 16. Similarly the Court has invalidated a patent setting forth a system for triggering alarm limits in connection with catalytic conversion despite a similar utility, concreteness, and tangibility. <i>Flook, supra</i><i>.</i> And the Court has invalidated a patent setting forth a process that transforms, for computer-programming purposes, decimal figures into binary figures\u0097even though the result would seem useful, concrete, and at least arguably (within the computer's wiring system) tangible. <i>Gottschalk, supra</i>.</p>\n<p>Even were I to assume (purely for argument's sake) that claim 13 meets certain general definitions of process pat- entability, however, it still fails the one at issue here: the requirement that it not amount to a simple natural corre- lation, <i>i.e.</i>, a \"natural phenomenon.\" See <i>Flook, supra,</i> at 588, n. 9 (even assuming patent for improved catalytic converter system meets broad statutory definition of patentable \"process,\" it is invalid under natural phenome- non doctrine); <i>Diehr,</i> 450 U. S., at 184-185 (explaining that, even if patent meets all other requirements, it must meet the natural phenomena requirement as well).</p>\n<p>At most, respondents have simply described the natural law at issue in the abstract patent language of a \"process.\" But they cannot avoid the fact that the process is no more than an instruction to read some numbers in light of medical knowledge. Cf. <i>id.</i>, at 192 (warning against \"al- low[ing] a competent draftsman to evade the recognized limitations on the type of subject matter eligible for patent protection\"). One might, of course, reduce the \"process\" to a series of steps, <i>e.g.</i>, Step 1: gather data; Step 2: read a number; Step 3: compare the number with the norm; Step 4: act accordingly. But one can reduce <i>any</i> process to a series of steps. The question is what those steps embody. And here, aside from the unpatented test, they embody only the correlation between homocysteine and vitamin deficiency that the researchers uncovered. In my view, that correlation is an unpatentable \"natural phenomenon,\" and I can find nothing in claim 13 that adds anything more of significance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>If I am correct in my conclusion in Part III that the patent is invalid, then special public interest considera- tions reinforce my view that we should decide this case. To fail to do so threatens to leave the medical profession subject to the restrictions imposed by this individual patent and others of its kind. Those restrictions may inhibit doctors from using their best medical judgment; they may force doctors to spend unnecessary time and energy to enter into license agreements; they may divert resources from the medical task of health care to the legal task of searching patent files for similar simple correla- tions; they may raise the cost of healthcare while inhibit- ing its effective delivery. See Brief for American Clinical Laboratory Association as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 8-13.</p>\n<p>Even if Part III is wrong, however, it still would be valu- able to decide this case. Our doing so would help diminish legal uncertainty in the area, affecting a \"substantial number of patent claims.\" See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 12-14 (filed Aug. 26, 2005).

The process consists of using any test\n(whether patented or unpatented) to measure the level in\na body fluid of an amino acid called homocysteine and then\nnoticing whether its level is elevated above the norm; if so,\na vitamin deficiency is likely.\n  The lower courts held that the patent claim is valid.\nThey also found the petitioner, Laboratory Corporation of\nAmerica Holdings (LabCorp), liable for inducing infringe\nment of the claim when it encouraged doctors to order\ndiagnostic tests for measuring homocysteine. The courts\nassessed damages. And they enjoined LabCorp from using\nany tests that would lead the doctors it serves to find a\nvitamin deficiency by taking account of elevated homocys\nteine levels.\n  We granted certiorari in this case to determine whether\nthe patent claim is invalid on the ground that it improp\nerly seeks to \u201cclaim a monopoly over a basic scientific\nrelationship,\u201d Pet. for Cert. i, namely, the relationship\nbetween homocysteine and vitamin deficiency. The Court\nhas dismissed the writ as improvidently granted. In my\n2      LABORATORY CORP. OF AMERICA HOLDINGS v. \n\n           METABOLITE LABORATORIES, INC. \n\n                 BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nview, we should not dismiss the writ. The question pre\nsented is not unusually difficult. We have the authority to\ndecide it. We said that we would do so. The parties and\namici have fully briefed the question. And those who en\ngage in medical research, who practice medicine, and who as\npatients depend upon proper health care, might well benefit\nfrom this Court\u2019s authoritative answer.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   The relevant principle of law \u201c[e]xclude[s] from . . .\npatent protection . . . laws of nature, natural phenomena,\nand abstract ideas.\u201d Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 185\n(1981). This principle finds its roots in both English and\nAmerican law. See, e.g., Neilson v. Harford, Webster\u2019s\nPatent Cases 295, 371 (1841); Le Roy v. Tatham, 14 How.\n156. 175 (1853); O\u2019Reilly v. Morse, 15 How. 62 (1854); The\nTelephone Cases, 126 U. S. 1 (1888). The principle means\nthat Einstein could not have \u201cpatent[ed] his celebrated law\nthat E=mc2; nor could Newton have patented the law of\ngravity.\u201d Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, 309\n(1980). Neither can one patent \u201ca novel and useful\nmathematical formula,\u201d Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584,\n585 (1978), the motive power of electromagnetism or\nsteam, Morse, supra, at 116, \u201cthe heat of the sun, electric\nity, or the qualities of metals,\u201d Funk Brothers Seed Co. v.\nKalo Inoculant Co., 333 U. S. 127, 130 (1948).\n   The justification for the principle does not lie in any\nclaim that \u201claws of nature\u201d are obvious, or that their dis\ncovery is easy, or that they are not useful. To the con\ntrary, research into such matters may be costly and time-\nconsuming; monetary incentives may matter; and the\nfruits of those incentives and that research may prove of\ngreat benefit to the human race. Rather, the reason for\nthe exclusion is that sometimes too much patent protec\ntion can impede rather than \u201cpromote the Progress of\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nScience and useful Arts,\u201d the constitutional objective of\npatent and copyright protection. U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78,\ncl. 8.\n   The problem arises from the fact that patents do not\nonly encourage research by providing monetary incentives\nfor invention. Sometimes their presence can discourage\nresearch by impeding the free exchange of information, for\nexample by forcing researchers to avoid the use of poten\ntially patented ideas, by leading them to conduct costly\nand time-consuming searches of existing or pending pat\nents, by requiring complex licensing arrangements, and by\nraising the costs of using the patented information, some\ntimes prohibitively so.\n   Patent law seeks to avoid the dangers of overprotection\njust as surely as it seeks to avoid the diminished incentive\nto invent that underprotection can threaten. One way in\nwhich patent law seeks to sail between these opposing and\nrisky shoals is through rules that bring certain types of\ninvention and discovery within the scope of patentability\nwhile excluding others. And scholars have noted that\n\u201cpatent law[\u2019s] exclu[sion of] fundamental scientific (in\ncluding mathematical) and technological principles,\u201d (like\ncopyright\u2019s exclusion of \u201cideas\u201d) is a rule of the latter\nvariety. W. Landes & R. Posner, The Economic Structure\nof Intellectual Property Law 305 (2003). That rule reflects\n\u201cboth . . . the enormous potential for rent seeking that\nwould be created if property rights could be obtained in\n[those basic principles] and . . . the enormous transaction\ncosts that would be imposed on would-be users.\u201d Id., at\n305\u2013306; cf. Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp., 45 F. 2d\n119, 122 (CA2 1930) (L. Hand, J.).\n   Thus, the Court has recognized that \u201c[p]henomena of\nnature, though just discovered, mental processes, and\nabstract intellectual concepts are . . . the basic tools of\nscientific and technological work.\u201d Gottschalk v. Benson,\n409 U. S. 63, 67 (1972). It has treated fundamental scien\n4      LABORATORY CORP. OF AMERICA HOLDINGS v. \n\n           METABOLITE LABORATORIES, INC. \n\n                 BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ntific principles as \u201cpart of the storehouse of knowledge\u201d\nand manifestations of laws of nature as \u201cfree to all men\nand reserved exclusively to none.\u201d Funk Bros., supra, at\n130. And its doing so reflects a basic judgment that pro\ntection in such cases, despite its potentially positive incen\ntive effects, would too often severely interfere with, or\ndiscourage, development and the further spread of useful\nknowledge itself.\n                             B\n   In the 1980s three university doctors, after conducting\nresearch into vitamin deficiencies, found a correlation\nbetween high levels of homocysteine in the blood and\ndeficiencies of two essential vitamins, folate (folic acid)\nand cobalamin (vitamin B12). They also developed more\naccurate methods for testing body fluids for homocysteine,\nusing gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. They\npublished their findings in 1985. They obtained a patent.\nAnd that patent eventually found its commercial way into\nthe hands of Competitive Technologies, Inc. (CTI), and its\nlicensee Metabolite Laboratories, Inc. (Metabolite), the\nrespondents here.\n   The patent contains several claims that cover the re\nsearchers\u2019 new methods for testing homocysteine levels\nusing gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Supp.\nApp. 30. In 1991, LabCorp (in fact, a corporate predeces\nsor) took a license from Metabolite permitting it to use the\ntests described in the patent in return for 27.5% of related\nrevenues. Their agreement permitted LabCorp to termi\nnate the arrangement if \u201ca more cost effective commercial\nalternative is available that does not infringe a valid and\nenforceable claim of \u201d the patent. App. 305 (emphasis\nadded).\n   Until 1998, LabCorp used the patented tests and paid\nroyalties. By that time, however, growing recognition that\nelevated homocysteine levels might predict risk of heart\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndisease led to increased testing demand. Other companies\nbegan to produce alternative testing procedures. And\nLabCorp decided to use one of these other procedures\u2014a\ntest devised by Abbott Laboratories that LabCorp con\ncluded was \u201cfar superior.\u201d Id., at 167 (testimony of Peter\nWentz).\n  LabCorp continued to pay royalties to respondents\nwhenever it used the patented tests. But it concluded that\nAbbott\u2019s test did not fall within the patent\u2019s protective\nscope. And LabCorp consequently refused to pay royalties\nwhen it used the Abbott test. Id., at 237 (payment elimi\nnated due to \u201cchange in methodology\u201d).\n  In response, respondents brought this suit against\nLabCorp for patent infringement and breach of the license\nagreement. They did not claim that LabCorp\u2019s use of the\nAbbott test infringed the patent\u2019s claims describing meth\nods for testing for homocysteine. Instead, respondents\nrelied on a broader claim not limited to those tests, namely\nclaim 13, the sole claim at issue here. That claim\u2014set\nforth below in its entirety\u2014seeks patent protection for:\n       \u201cA method for detecting a deficiency of cobalamin or\n    folate in warm-blooded animals comprising the steps\n    of:\n       \u201cassaying a body fluid for an elevated level of total\n    homocysteine; and\n       \u201ccorrelating an elevated level of total homocysteine\n    in said body fluid with a deficiency of cobalamin or\n    folate.\u201d Supp. App. 30.\n  Claim 13, respondents argued, created a protected\nmonopoly over the process of \u201ccorrelating\u201d test results and\npotential vitamin deficiencies. The parties agreed that the\nwords \u201cassaying a body fluid\u201d refer to the use of any test at\nall, whether patented or not patented, that determines\nwhether a body fluid has an \u201celevated level of total homo\ncysteine.\u201d And at trial, the inventors testified that claim\n6      LABORATORY CORP. OF AMERICA HOLDINGS v. \n\n           METABOLITE LABORATORIES, INC. \n\n                 BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\n13\u2019s \u201ccorrelating\u201d step consists simply of a physician\u2019s\nrecognizing that a test that shows an elevated homocys\nteine level\u2014by that very fact\u2014shows the patient likely\nhas a cobalamin or folate deficiency. App. 108\u2013111 (testi\nmony of Dr. Sally Stabler); id., at 131\u2013148 (testimony of\nRobert Allen). They added that, because the natural\nrelationship between homocysteine and vitamin deficiency\nwas now well known, such \u201ccorrelating\u201d would occur\nautomatically in the mind of any competent physician.\nId., at 137\u2013138 (same).\n   On this understanding of the claim, respondents argued,\nLabCorp was liable for inducing doctors to infringe. More\nspecifically, LabCorp would conduct homocysteine tests\nand report the results measured in micromoles (millionths\nof a mole) per liter (symbolized \u00b5mol/L). Doctors, because\nof their training, would know that a normal homocysteine\nrange in blood is between 7 and 22 \u00b5mol/L (and in urine\nbetween 1 and 20 \u00b5mol/L), Supp. App. 14, and would know\nthat an elevated homocysteine level is correlated with a\nvitamin deficiency. Hence, in reviewing the test results,\ndoctors would look at the \u00b5mol/L measure and automati\ncally reach a conclusion about whether or not a person was\nsuffering from a vitamin deficiency. Claim 13 therefore\ncovered every homocysteine test that a doctor reviewed.\nAnd since LabCorp had advertised its tests and educated\ndoctors about the correlation, LabCorp should be liable for\nactively inducing the doctors\u2019 infringing acts. See 35\nU. S. C. \u00a7271(b).\n   The jury found LabCorp liable on this theory. The\nDistrict Court calculated damages based on unpaid royal\nties for some 350,000 homocysteine tests performed by\nLabCorp using the Abbott method. The court also en\njoined LabCorp from performing \u201cany homocysteine-only\ntest, including, without limitation homocysteine-only tests\nvia the Abbott method.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a\u201337a\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)              7\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   LabCorp appealed. It argued to the Federal Circuit that\nthe trial court was wrong to construe claim 13 so broadly\nthat infringement took place \u201cevery time a physician does\nnothing more than look at a patient\u2019s homocysteine level.\u201d\nCorrected Brief for Appellant in No. 03\u20131120 (CA Fed.),\np. 28 (hereinafter Brief for Appellant). Indeed, if so con\nstrued (rather than construed, say, to cover only patented\ntests), then claim 13 was \u201cinvalid for indefiniteness, lack\nof written description, non-enablement, anticipation,\nand obviousness.\u201d Id., at 38. LabCorp told the Federal\nCircuit:\n    \u201cIf the Court were to uphold this vague claim, anyone\n    could obtain a patent on any scientific correlation\u2014\n    that there is a link between fact A and fact B\u2014merely\n    by drafting a patent claiming no more than \u2018test for\n    fact A and correlate with fact B\u2019 . . . . Claim 13 does\n    no more than that. If it is upheld, CTI would improp\n    erly gain a monopoly over a basic scientific fact rather\n    than any novel invention of its own. The law is set\n    tled that no such claim should be allowed. See, e.g.,\n    Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175 (1981); . . . Chisum on\n    Patents \u00a71.03[6].\u201d Id., at 41.\n  The Federal Circuit rejected LabCorp\u2019s arguments. It\nagreed with the District Court that claim 13\u2019s \u201ccorrelating\u201d\nstep simply means \u201crelating total homocysteine levels to\ncobalamin or folate deficiency, a deficiency in both, or a\ndeficiency in neither.\u201d 370 F. 3d 1354, 1363 (2004). That\nmeaning, it said, is \u201cdiscernable and clear\u201d; it is definite, it\nis described in writing, and it would enable virtually\nanyone to follow the instruction it gives. And that is\nsufficient. Id., at 1366\u20131367. The Court did not address\nLabCorp\u2019s argument that, if so construed, claim 13 must\nbe struck down as an improper effort to obtain patent\nprotection for a law of nature.\n  Moreover, the Circuit concluded, because any competent\n8       LABORATORY CORP. OF AMERICA HOLDINGS v. \n\n            METABOLITE LABORATORIES, INC. \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ndoctor reviewing test results would automatically correlate\nthose results with the presence or absence of a vitamin\ndeficiency, virtually every doctor who ordered and read the\ntests was a direct infringer. And because LabCorp \u201cpub\nlishes . . . Continuing Medical Education articles\u201d and\nother pieces, which urge doctors to conduct the relevant\ntests and to reach a conclusion about whether a patient is\nsuffering from a vitamin deficiency based upon the test\nresults, LabCorp induces infringement. Id., at 1365.\nFinally, the court rejected LabCorp\u2019s challenge to the\ninjunction. Id., at 1372.\n   LabCorp filed a petition for certiorari. Question Three\nof the petition asks \u201c[w]hether a method patent . . . direct\ning a party simply to \u2018correlate\u2019 test results can validly\nclaim a monopoly over a basic scientific relationship . . .\nsuch that any doctor necessarily infringes the patent\nmerely by thinking about the relationship after looking at\na test result.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. After calling for and receiv\ning the views of the Solicitor General, 543 U. S. 1185\n(2005), we granted the petition, limited to Question Three.\n                              II\n   The question before us is whether claim 13, as construed\nand applied in the way I have described in Part I\u2013B, is\ninvalid in light of the \u201claw of nature\u201d principle, described\nin Part I\u2013A. I believe that we should answer that ques\ntion. There is a technical procedural reason for not doing\nso, namely, that LabCorp did not refer in the lower courts\nto \u00a7101 of the Patent Act, which sets forth subject matter\nthat is patentable, and within the bounds of which the\n\u201claw of nature\u201d principle most comfortably fits. See 35\nU. S. C. \u00a7101 (patent may be obtained for \u201cany new and\nuseful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of\nmatter\u201d); Flook, 437 U. S., at 588\u2013589. There is also a\npractical reason for not doing so, namely, that we might\nbenefit from the views of the Federal Circuit, which did\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nnot directly consider the question. See, e.g., United States\nv. Bestfoods, 524 U. S. 51, 72\u201373 (1998).\n   Nonetheless, stronger considerations argue for our\nreaching a decision. For one thing, the technical proce\ndural objection is tenuous. LabCorp argued the essence of\nits present claim below. It told the Federal Circuit that\nclaim 13 as construed by the District Court was too\n\u201cvague\u201d because that construction would allow \u201canyone\u201d to\n\u201cobtain a patent on any scientific correlation;\u201d it would\npermit the respondents \u201cimproperly [to] gain a monopoly\nover a basic scientific fact\u201d despite \u201csettled\u201d law \u201cthat no\nsuch claim should be allowed.\u201d Brief for Appellant 41\n(citing Diehr, 450 U. S., at 1185; 1 D. Chisum, Patents\n\u00a71.03[6]) (2006 ed.) (hereinafter Chisum). LabCorp explic\nitly stated in its petition for certiorari that, \u201cif the Court\nallows the Federal Circuit opinion to stand . . . [respon\ndents] would improperly gain monopolies over basic scien\ntific facts rather than any novel inventions of their own.\u201d\nPet. for Cert. 25 (citing Diehr, supra; Gottschalk, 409 U. S.\n63; Funk Bros., 333 U. S. 127; Mackay Radio & Telegraph\nCo. v. Radio Corp. of America, 306 U. S. 86 (1939)). And\nafter considering the Solicitor General\u2019s advice not to hear\nthe case (primarily based upon LabCorp\u2019s failure to refer\nto 35 U. S. C. \u00a7101), we rejected that advice, thereby \u201cnec\nessarily consider[ing] and reject[ing] that contention as a\nbasis for denying review.\u201d United States v. Williams, 504\nU. S. 36, 40 (1992).\n   For another thing, I can find no good practical reason for\nrefusing to decide the case. The relevant issue has been\nfully briefed and argued by the parties, the Government,\nand 20 amici. The record is comprehensive, allowing us to\nlearn the precise nature of the patent claim, to consider\nthe commercial and medical context (which the parties\nand amici have described in detail), and to become famil\niar with the arguments made in all courts. Neither\nthe factual record nor the briefing suffers from any\n10     LABORATORY CORP. OF AMERICA HOLDINGS v. \n\n           METABOLITE LABORATORIES, INC. \n\n                 BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nsignificant gap. No party has identified any prejudice due\nto our answering the question. And there is no indication\nthat LabCorp\u2019s failure to cite \u00a7101 reflected unfair\ngamesmanship.\n  Of course, further consideration by the Federal Circuit\nmight help us reach a better decision. Lower court consid\neration almost always helps. But the thoroughness of the\nbriefing leads me to conclude that the extra time, cost, and\nuncertainty that further proceedings would engender are\nnot worth the potential benefit.\n  Finally, I believe that important considerations of the\npublic interest\u2014including that of clarifying the law in this\narea sooner rather than later\u2014argue strongly for our\ndeciding the question presented now. See Part IV, infra.\n                               III\n  I turn to the merits. The researchers who obtained the\npresent patent found that an elevated level of homocys\nteine in a warm-blooded animal is correlated with folate\nand cobalamin deficiencies. As construed by the Federal\nCircuit, claim 13 provides those researchers with control\nover doctors\u2019 efforts to use that correlation to diagnose\nvitamin deficiencies in a patient. Does the law permit\nsuch protection or does claim 13, in the circumstances,\namount to an invalid effort to patent a \u201cphenomenon of\nnature\u201d?\n  I concede that the category of non-patentable \u201cphenom\nena of nature,\u201d like the categories of \u201cmental processes,\u201d\nand \u201cabstract intellectual concepts,\u201d is not easy to define.\nSee Flook, supra, at 589 (\u201cThe line between a patentable\n\u2018process\u2019 and an unpatentable \u2018principle\u2019 is not always\nclear\u201d); cf.

It does not require\nus to consider the precise scope of the \u201cnatural phenome\nnon\u201d doctrine or any other difficult issue. In my view,\nclaim 13 is invalid no matter how narrowly one reasonably\ninterprets that doctrine.\n   There can be little doubt that the correlation between\nhomocysteine and vitamin deficiency set forth in claim 13\nis a \u201cnatural phenomenon.\u201d That is what the petitioners\nargue.

They point to\nthis Court\u2019s statements that a \u201cprocess is not unpatentable\nsimply because it contains a law of nature,\u201d Flook, 437\nU. S., at 590; see also Gottschalk, 409 U.

They add that claim 13 is a\npatentable \u201capplication of a law of nature\u201d because, con\nsidered as a whole, it (1) \u201centails a physical transforma\ntion of matter,\u201d namely, the alteration of a blood sample\nduring whatever test is used, Brief for Respondents 33\n(citing Cochrane v. Deener, 94 U. S. 780, 788 (1877);\nGottschalk, supra, at 70), and because it (2) \u201cproduces a\n\u2018useful, concrete, and tangible result,\u2019 \u201d namely, detection\nof a vitamin deficiency, Brief for Respondents 36 (citing\nState Street Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature Financial\nGroup, Inc., 149 F. 3d 1368, 1373 (CA Fed 1998)).\n   In my view, however, the cases to which respondents\nrefer do not support their claim. Neither Cochrane nor\nGottschalk can help them because the process described in\nclaim 13 is not a process for transforming blood or any\nother matter. Claim 13\u2019s process instructs the user to (1)\nobtain test results and (2) think about them. Why should\nit matter if the test results themselves were obtained\nthrough an unpatented procedure that involved the trans\nformation of blood? Claim 13 is indifferent to that fact, for\nit tells the user to use any test at all. Indeed, to use virtu\nally any natural phenomenon for virtually any useful\npurpose could well involve the use of empirical informa\ntion obtained through an unpatented means that might\nhave involved transforming matter. Neither Cochrane nor\nGottschalk suggests that that fact renders the phenome\nnon patentable. See Cochrane, supra, at 785 (upholding\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

That case does say that a\nprocess is patentable if it produces a \u201cuseful, concrete, and\ntangible result.\u201d 149 F. 3d, at 1373. But this Court has\nnever made such a statement and, if taken literally, the\nstatement would cover instances where this Court has\nheld the contrary. The Court, for example, has invalidated\na claim to the use of electromagnetic current for transmit\nting messages over long distances even though it produces\na result that seems \u201cuseful, concrete, and tangible.\u201d\nMorse, supra, at 16. Similarly the Court has invalidated a\npatent setting forth a system for triggering alarm limits in\nconnection with catalytic conversion despite a similar\nutility, concreteness, and tangibility. Flook, supra. And\nthe Court has invalidated a patent setting forth a process\nthat transforms, for computer-programming purposes,\ndecimal figures into binary figures\u2014even though the\nresult would seem useful, concrete, and at least arguably\n(within the computer\u2019s wiring system) tangible.\nGottschalk, supra.\n   Even were I to assume (purely for argument\u2019s sake) that\nclaim 13 meets certain general definitions of process pat\nentability, however, it still fails the one at issue here: the\nrequirement that it not amount to a simple natural corre\nlation, i.e., a \u201cnatural phenomenon.\u201d See Flook, supra, at\n588, n. 9 (even assuming patent for improved catalytic\nconverter system meets broad statutory definition of\npatentable \u201cprocess,\u201d it is invalid under natural phenome\nnon doctrine); Diehr, 450 U.

One might, of course, reduce the \u201cprocess\u201d to\na series of steps, e.g., Step 1: gather data; Step 2: read a\nnumber; Step 3: compare the number with the norm; Step\n4: act accordingly. But one can reduce any process to a\nseries of steps. The question is what those steps embody.\nAnd here, aside from the unpatented test, they embody\nonly the correlation between homocysteine and vitamin\ndeficiency that the researchers uncovered. In my view,\nthat correlation is an unpatentable \u201cnatural phenomenon,\u201d\nand I can find nothing in claim 13 that adds anything\nmore of significance.\n                              IV\n   If I am correct in my conclusion in Part III that the\npatent is invalid, then special public interest considera\ntions reinforce my view that we should decide this case.\nTo fail to do so threatens to leave the medical profession\nsubject to the restrictions imposed by this individual\npatent and others of its kind.

The process consists of using any test (whether patented or unpatented) to measure the level in a body fluid of an amino acid called homocysteine and then noticing whether its level is elevated above the norm; if so, a vitamin deficiency is likely.</p>\n<p>The lower courts held that the patent claim is valid. They also found the petitioner, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LabCorp), liable for inducing infringe- ment of the claim when it encouraged doctors to order diagnostic tests for measuring homocysteine. The courts assessed damages. And they enjoined LabCorp from using any tests that would lead the doctors it serves to find a vitamin deficiency by taking account of elevated homocys- teine levels.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari in this case to determine whether the patent claim is invalid on the ground that it improp- erly seeks to \"claim a monopoly over a basic scientific relationship,\" Pet. for Cert. i, namely, the relationship between homocysteine and vitamin deficiency. The Court has dismissed the writ as improvidently granted. In my view, we should not dismiss the writ. The question pre- sented is not unusually difficult. We have the authority to decide it. We said that we would do so. The parties and <i>amici</i> have fully briefed the question. And those who en- gage in medical research, who practice medicine, and who as patients depend upon proper health care, might well benefit from this Court's authoritative answer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The relevant principle of law \"[e]xclude[s] from . . . patent protection . . . laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas.\" <i>Diamond</i> v. <i>Diehr,</i> 450 U. S. 175, 185 (1981). This principle finds its roots in both English and American law. See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Neilson</i> v. <i>Harford</i>, Webster's Patent Cases 295, 371 (1841); <i>Le Roy</i> v. <i>Tatham,</i> 14 How. 156. 175 (1853); <i>O'Reilly</i> v. <i>Morse</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86821\"><a href=\"/opinion/86821/oreilly-v-morse/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span> (1854); <i>The</i> <i>Telephone Cases,</i> 126 U. S. 1 (1888). The principle means that Einstein could not have \"patent[ed] his celebrated law that E=mc2; nor could Newton have patented the law of gravity.\" <i>Diamond</i> v. <i>Chakrabarty</i>, 447 U. S. 303, 309 (1980). Neither can one patent \"a novel and useful mathematical formula,\" <i>Parker</i> v. <i>Flook</i>, 437 U. S. 584, 585 (1978), the motive power of electromagnetism or steam, <i>Morse, supra,</i> at 116, \"the heat of the sun, electric- ity, or the qualities of metals,\" <i>Funk Brothers Seed Co.</i> v. <i>Kalo Inoculant Co.,</i> 333 U. S. 127, 130 (1948).</p>\n<p>The justification for the principle does not lie in any claim that \"laws of nature\" are obvious, or that their dis- covery is easy, or that they are not useful. To the con- trary, research into such matters may be costly and time- consuming; monetary incentives may matter; and the fruits of those incentives and that research may prove of great benefit to the human race. Rather, the reason for the exclusion is that sometimes <i>too much</i> patent protec- tion can impede rather than \"promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts,\" the constitutional objective of patent and copyright protection. U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 8.</p>\n<p>The problem arises from the fact that patents do not only encourage research by providing monetary incentives for invention. Sometimes their presence can discourage research by impeding the free exchange of information, for example by forcing researchers to avoid the use of poten- tially patented ideas, by leading them to conduct costly and time-consuming searches of existing or pending pat- ents, by requiring complex licensing arrangements, and by raising the costs of using the patented information, some- times prohibitively so.</p>\n<p>Patent law seeks to avoid the dangers of overprotection just as surely as it seeks to avoid the diminished incentive to invent that underprotection can threaten. One way in which patent law seeks to sail between these opposing and risky shoals is through rules that bring certain types of invention and discovery within the scope of patentability while excluding others. And scholars have noted that \"patent law['s] exclu[sion of] fundamental scientific (in- cluding mathematical) and technological principles,\" (like copyright's exclusion of \"ideas\") is a rule of the latter variety. W. Landes &amp; R. Posner, The Economic Structure of Intellectual Property Law 305 (2003). That rule reflects \"both . . . the enormous potential for rent seeking that would be created if property rights could be obtained in [those basic principles] and . . . the enormous transaction costs that would be imposed on would-be users.\" <i>Id</i>., at 305-306; cf. <i>Nichols</i> v. <i>Universal Pictures Corp.</i>, 45 F. 2d 119, 122 (CA2 1930) (L. Hand, J.).</p>\n<p>Thus, the Court has recognized that \"[p]henomena of nature, though just discovered, mental processes, and abstract intellectual concepts are . . . the basic tools of scientific and technological work.\" <i>Gottschalk</i> v. <i>Benson,</i> 409 U. S. 63, 67 (1972). It has treated fundamental scien- tific principles as \"part of the storehouse of knowledge\" and manifestations of laws of nature as \"free to all men and reserved exclusively to none.\" <i>Funk Bros.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 130. And its doing so reflects a basic judgment that pro- tection in such cases, despite its potentially positive incen- tive effects, would too often severely interfere with, or discourage, development and the further spread of useful knowledge itself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In the 1980s three university doctors, after conducting research into vitamin deficiencies, found a correlation between high levels of homocysteine in the blood and deficiencies of two essential vitamins, folate (folic acid) and cobalamin (vitamin B12). They also developed more accurate methods for testing body fluids for homocysteine, using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. They published their findings in 1985. They obtained a patent. And that patent eventually found its commercial way into the hands of Competitive Technologies, Inc. (CTI), and its licensee Metabolite Laboratories, Inc. (Metabolite), the respondents here.</p>\n<p>The patent contains several claims that cover the re- searchers' new methods for testing homocysteine levels using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Supp. App. 30. In 1991, LabCorp (in fact, a corporate predeces- sor) took a license from Metabolite permitting it to use the tests described in the patent in return for 27.5% of related revenues. Their agreement permitted LabCorp to termi- nate the arrangement if \"a more cost effective commercial alternative is available <i>that does not infringe a valid and</i> <i>enforceable claim</i> of\" the patent. App. 305 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Until 1998, LabCorp used the patented tests and paid royalties. By that time, however, growing recognition that elevated homocysteine levels might predict risk of heart disease led to increased testing demand. Other companies began to produce alternative testing procedures. And LabCorp decided to use one of these other procedures\u0097a test devised by Abbott Laboratories that LabCorp con- cluded was \"far superior.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 167 (testimony of Peter Wentz).</p>\n<p>LabCorp continued to pay royalties to respondents whenever it used the patented tests. But it concluded that Abbott's test did not fall within the patent's protective scope. And LabCorp consequently refused to pay royalties when it used the Abbott test. <i>Id.,</i> at 237 (payment elimi- nated due to \"change in methodology\").</p>\n<p>In response, respondents brought this suit against LabCorp for patent infringement and breach of the license agreement. They did not claim that LabCorp's use of the Abbott test infringed the patent's claims describing meth- ods for testing for homocysteine. Instead, respondents relied on a broader claim not limited to those tests, namely claim 13, the sole claim at issue here. That claim\u0097set forth below in its entirety\u0097seeks patent protection for:</p>\n<blockquote>\"A method for detecting a deficiency of cobalamin or folate in warm-blooded animals comprising the steps of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"assaying a body fluid for an elevated level of total homocysteine; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"correlating an elevated level of total homocysteine in said body fluid with a deficiency of cobalamin or folate.\" Supp. App. 30.</blockquote>\n<p>Claim 13, respondents argued, created a protected monopoly over the process of \"correlating\" test results and potential vitamin deficiencies. The parties agreed that the words \"assaying a body fluid\" refer to the use of any test at all, whether patented or not patented, that determines whether a body fluid has an \"elevated level of total homo- cysteine.\" And at trial, the inventors testified that claim 13's \"correlating\" step consists simply of a physician's recognizing that a test that shows an elevated homocys- teine level\u0097by that very fact\u0097shows the patient likely has a cobalamin or folate deficiency. App. 108-111 (testi- mony of Dr. Sally Stabler); <i>id.,</i> at 131-148 (testimony of Robert Allen). They added that, because the natural relationship between homocysteine and vitamin deficiency was now well known, such \"correlating\" would occur automatically in the mind of any competent physician. <i>Id.,</i> at 137-138 (same).</p>\n<p>On this understanding of the claim, respondents argued, LabCorp was liable for inducing doctors to infringe. More specifically, LabCorp would conduct homocysteine tests and report the results measured in micromoles (millionths of a mole) per liter (symbolized \u00b5mol/L). Doctors, because of their training, would know that a normal homocysteine range in blood is between 7 and 22 \u00b5mol/L (and in urine between 1 and 20 \u00b5mol/L), Supp. App. 14, and would know that an elevated homocysteine level is correlated with a vitamin deficiency. Hence, in reviewing the test results, doctors would look at the \u00b5mol/L measure and automati- cally reach a conclusion about whether or not a person was suffering from a vitamin deficiency. Claim 13 therefore covered <i>every</i> homocysteine test that a doctor reviewed. And since LabCorp had advertised its tests and educated doctors about the correlation, LabCorp should be liable for actively inducing the doctors' infringing acts. See 35 U. S. C. \u00a7271(b).</p>\n<p>The jury found LabCorp liable on this theory. The District Court calculated damages based on unpaid royal- ties for some 350,000 homocysteine tests performed by LabCorp using the Abbott method. The court also en- joined LabCorp from performing \"any homocysteine-only test, including, without limitation homocysteine-only tests via the Abbott method.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a-37a (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>LabCorp appealed. It argued to the Federal Circuit that the trial court was wrong to construe claim 13 so broadly that infringement took place \"every time a physician does nothing more than look at a patient's homocysteine level.\" Corrected Brief for Appellant in No. 03-1120 (CA Fed.), p. 28 (hereinafter Brief for Appellant). Indeed, if so con- strued (rather than construed, say, to cover only <i>patented</i> tests), then claim 13 was \"invalid for indefiniteness, lack of written description, non-enablement, anticipation, and obviousness.\" <i>Id</i>., at 38. LabCorp told the Federal Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote>\"If the Court were to uphold this vague claim, anyone could obtain a patent on any scientific correlation\u0097 that there is a link between fact A and fact B\u0097merely by drafting a patent claiming no more than 'test for fact A and correlate with fact B' . . . . Claim 13 does no more than that. If it is upheld, CTI would improp- erly gain a monopoly over a basic scientific fact rather than any novel invention of its own. The law is set- tled that no such claim should be allowed. <i>See, e.g.,</i> <i>Diamond</i> v. <i>Diehr,</i> 450 U. S. 175 (1981); . . . Chisum on Patents \u00a71.03[6].\" <i>Id</i>., at 41.</blockquote>\n<p>The Federal Circuit rejected LabCorp's arguments. It agreed with the District Court that claim 13's \"correlating\" step simply means \"relating total homocysteine levels to cobalamin or folate deficiency, a deficiency in both, or a deficiency in neither.\" 370 F. 3d 1354, 1363 (2004). That meaning, it said, is \"discernable and clear\"; it is definite, it is described in writing, and it would enable virtually anyone to follow the instruction it gives. And that is sufficient. <i>Id</i>., at 1366-1367. The Court did not address LabCorp's argument that, <i>if so construed</i>, claim 13 must be struck down as an improper effort to obtain patent protection for a law of nature.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Circuit concluded, because any competent doctor reviewing test results would automatically correlate those results with the presence or absence of a vitamin deficiency, virtually every doctor who ordered and read the tests was a direct infringer. And because LabCorp \"pub- lishes . . . Continuing Medical Education articles\" and other pieces, which urge doctors to conduct the relevant tests and to reach a conclusion about whether a patient is suffering from a vitamin deficiency based upon the test results, LabCorp induces infringement. <i>Id.</i>, at 1365. Finally, the court rejected LabCorp's challenge to the injunction. <i>Id</i>., at 1372.</p>\n<p>LabCorp filed a petition for certiorari. Question Three of the petition asks \"[w]hether a method patent . . . direct- ing a party simply to 'correlate' test results can validly claim a monopoly over a basic scientific relationship . . . such that any doctor necessarily infringes the patent merely by thinking about the relationship after looking at a test result.\" Pet. for Cert. i. After calling for and receiv- ing the views of the Solicitor General, 543 U. S. 1185 (2005), we granted the petition, limited to Question Three.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The question before us is whether claim 13, as construed and applied in the way I have described in Part I\u0097B, is invalid in light of the \"law of nature\" principle, described in Part I\u0097A. I believe that we should answer that ques- tion. There is a technical procedural reason for not doing so, namely, that LabCorp did not refer in the lower courts to \u00a7101 of the Patent Act, which sets forth subject matter that is patentable, and within the bounds of which the \"law of nature\" principle most comfortably fits. See 35 U. S. C. \u00a7101 (patent may be obtained for \"any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter\"); <i>Flook,</i> 437 U. S., at 588-589. There is also a practical reason for not doing so, namely, that we might benefit from the views of the Federal Circuit, which did not directly consider the question. See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Bestfoods,</i> 524 U. S. 51, 72-73 (1998).</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, stronger considerations argue for our reaching a decision. For one thing, the technical proce- dural objection is tenuous. LabCorp argued the essence of its present claim below. It told the Federal Circuit that claim 13 as construed by the District Court was too \"vague\" because that construction would allow \"anyone\" to \"obtain a patent on any scientific correlation;\" it would permit the respondents \"improperly [to] gain a monopoly over a basic scientific fact\" despite \"settled\" law \"that no such claim should be allowed.\" Brief for Appellant 41 (citing <i>Diehr,</i> 450 U. S., at 1185; 1 D. Chisum, Patents \u00a71.03[6]) (2006 ed.) (hereinafter Chisum). LabCorp explic- itly stated in its petition for certiorari that, \"if the Court allows the Federal Circuit opinion to stand . . . [respon- dents] would improperly gain monopolies over basic scien- tific facts rather than any novel inventions of their own.\" Pet. for Cert. 25 (citing <i>Diehr</i>, <i>supra</i><i>; </i><i>Gottschalk,</i> 409 U. S. 63; <i>Funk Bros.,</i> 333 U. S. 127; <i>Mackay Radio &amp; Telegraph</i> <i>Co.</i> v. <i>Radio Corp. of America,</i> 306 U. S. 86 (1939)). And after considering the Solicitor General's advice not to hear the case (primarily based upon LabCorp's failure to refer to 35 U. S. C. \u00a7101), we rejected that advice, thereby \"nec- essarily consider[ing] and reject[ing] that contention as a basis for denying review.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Williams,</i> 504 U. S. 36, 40 (1992).</p>\n<p>For another thing, I can find no good practical reason for refusing to decide the case. The relevant issue has been fully briefed and argued by the parties, the Government, and 20 <i>amici</i>. The record is comprehensive, allowing us to learn the precise nature of the patent claim, to consider the commercial and medical context (which the parties and <i>amici</i> have described in detail), and to become famil- iar with the arguments made in all courts. Neither the factual record nor the briefing suffers from any significant gap. No party has identified any prejudice due to our answering the question. And there is no indication that LabCorp's failure to cite \u00a7101 reflected unfair gamesmanship.</p>\n<p>Of course, further consideration by the Federal Circuit might help us reach a better decision. Lower court consid- eration almost always helps. But the thoroughness of the briefing leads me to conclude that the extra time, cost, and uncertainty that further proceedings would engender are not worth the potential benefit.</p>\n<p>Finally, I believe that important considerations of the public interest\u0097including that of clarifying the law in this area sooner rather than later\u0097argue strongly for our deciding the question presented now. See Part IV, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>I turn to the merits. The researchers who obtained the present patent found that an elevated level of homocys- teine in a warm-blooded animal is correlated with folate and cobalamin deficiencies. As construed by the Federal Circuit, claim 13 provides those researchers with control over doctors' efforts to use that correlation to diagnose vitamin deficiencies in a patient. Does the law permit such protection or does claim 13, in the circumstances, amount to an invalid effort to patent a \"phenomenon of nature\"?</p>\n<p>I concede that the category of non-patentable \"phenom- ena of nature,\" like the categories of \"mental processes,\" and \"abstract intellectual concepts,\" is not easy to define. See <i>Flook, supra</i>, at 589 (\"The line between a patentable 'process' and an unpatentable 'principle' is not always clear\"); cf. <i>Nichols</i>, 45 F. 2d, at 122 (\"[W]e are as aware as anyone that the line [between copyrighted material and non-copyrightable ideas], wherever it is drawn, will seem arbitrary\"). After all, many a patentable invention rests upon its inventor's knowledge of natural phenomena; many \"process\" patents seek to make abstract intellectual concepts workably concrete; and all conscious human action involves a mental process. See generally 1 Chisum \u00a71.03, at 78-295. Nor can one easily use such abstract categories directly to distinguish instances of likely benefi- cial, from likely harmful, forms of protection. Cf. FTC, To Promote Innovation: The Proper Balance of Competition and Patent Law and Policy, ch. 3, p. 1 (Oct. 2003) (herein- after FTC) (collecting evidence that \"issues of fixed cost recovery, alternative appropriability mechanisms, and relationships between initial and follow-on innovation\" vary by industry); Burk &amp; Lemley, Policy Levers in Patent Law, 89 Va. L. Rev. 1575, 1577-1589 (2003) (\"Recent evidence has demonstrated that this complex relationship [between patents and innovation] is . . . industry-specific at each stage of the patent process\").</p>\n<p>But this case is not at the boundary. It does not require us to consider the precise scope of the \"natural phenome- non\" doctrine or any other difficult issue. In my view, claim 13 is invalid no matter how narrowly one reasonably interprets that doctrine.</p>\n<p>There can be little doubt that the correlation between homocysteine and vitamin deficiency set forth in claim 13 is a \"natural phenomenon.\" That is what the petitioners argue. It is what the Solicitor General has told us. Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 19 (filed Dec. 23, 2005) (\"The natural relationship between elevated homocysteine and deficiencies in the B vitamins is an unpatentable 'principle in natural philosophy or physical science'\") (quoting <i>Morse</i>, 15 How., at 116)). Indeed, it is close to what the respondents concede. Brief for Respondents 31 (\"The correlation between total homocysteine and deficien- cies in cobalamin and folate that the Inventors discovered could be considered, standing alone, a 'natural phenome- non' in the literal sense: It is an observable aspect of bio- chemistry in at least some human populations\").</p>\n<p>The respondents argue, however, that the correlation is nonetheless patentable because claim 13 packages it in the form of a \"process\" for detecting vitamin deficiency, with discrete testing and correlating steps. They point to this Court's statements that a \"process is not unpatentable simply because it contains a law of nature,\" <i>Flook</i>, 437 U. S., at 590; see also <i>Gottschalk</i>, 409 U. S., at 67, and that \"an <i>application</i> of a law of nature . . . to a known . . . process may well be deserving of patent protection.\" <i>Diehr,</i> 450 U. S., at 187<i>.</i> They add that claim 13 is a patentable \"application of a law of nature\" because, con- sidered as a whole, it (1) \"entails a physical transforma- tion of matter,\" namely, the alteration of a blood sample during whatever test is used, Brief for Respondents 33 (citing <i>Cochrane</i> v. <i>Deener,</i> 94 U. S. 780, 788 (1877); <i>Gottschalk, supra,</i> at 70), and because it (2) \"produces a 'useful, concrete, and tangible result,'\" namely, detection of a vitamin deficiency, Brief for Respondents 36 (citing <i>State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co.</i> v. <i>Signature Financial</i> <i>Group, Inc.</i>, 149 F. 3d 1368, 1373 (CA Fed 1998)).</p>\n<p>In my view, however, the cases to which respondents refer do not support their claim. Neither <i>Cochrane</i> nor <i>Gottschalk</i> can help them because the process described in claim 13 is <i>not</i> a process for transforming blood or any other matter. Claim 13's process instructs the user to (1) obtain test results and (2) think about them. Why should it matter if the test results themselves were obtained through an unpatented procedure that involved the trans- formation of blood? Claim 13 is indifferent to that fact, for it tells the user to use any test at all. Indeed, to use virtu- ally any natural phenomenon for virtually any useful purpose could well involve the use of empirical informa- tion obtained through an unpatented means that might have involved transforming matter. Neither <i>Cochrane</i> nor <i>Gottschalk</i> suggests that that fact renders the phenome- non patentable. See <i>Cochrane, supra</i>, at 785 (upholding process for improving quality of flour by removing impuri- ties with blasts of air); <i>Gottschalk, supra</i>, at 71-73 (reject- ing process for converting numerals to binary form through mathematical formula).</p>\n<p>Neither does the Federal Circuit's decision in <i>State</i> <i>Street Bank</i> help respondents. That case does say that a process is patentable if it produces a \"useful, concrete, and tangible result.\" 149 F. 3d, at 1373. But this Court has never made such a statement and, if taken literally, the statement would cover instances where this Court has held the contrary. The Court, for example, has invalidated a claim to the use of electromagnetic current for transmit- ting messages over long distances even though it produces a result that seems \"useful, concrete, and tangible.\" <i>Morse, supra</i>, at 16. Similarly the Court has invalidated a patent setting forth a system for triggering alarm limits in connection with catalytic conversion despite a similar utility, concreteness, and tangibility. <i>Flook, supra</i><i>.</i> And the Court has invalidated a patent setting forth a process that transforms, for computer-programming purposes, decimal figures into binary figures\u0097even though the result would seem useful, concrete, and at least arguably (within the computer's wiring system) tangible. <i>Gottschalk, supra</i>.</p>\n<p>Even were I to assume (purely for argument's sake) that claim 13 meets certain general definitions of process pat- entability, however, it still fails the one at issue here: the requirement that it not amount to a simple natural corre- lation, <i>i.e.</i>, a \"natural phenomenon.\" See <i>Flook, supra,</i> at 588, n. 9 (even assuming patent for improved catalytic converter system meets broad statutory definition of patentable \"process,\" it is invalid under natural phenome- non doctrine); <i>Diehr,</i> 450 U. S., at 184-185 (explaining that, even if patent meets all other requirements, it must meet the natural phenomena requirement as well).</p>\n<p>At most, respondents have simply described the natural law at issue in the abstract patent language of a \"process.\" But they cannot avoid the fact that the process is no more than an instruction to read some numbers in light of medical knowledge. Cf. <i>id.</i>, at 192 (warning against \"al- low[ing] a competent draftsman to evade the recognized limitations on the type of subject matter eligible for patent protection\"). One might, of course, reduce the \"process\" to a series of steps, <i>e.g.</i>, Step 1: gather data; Step 2: read a number; Step 3: compare the number with the norm; Step 4: act accordingly. But one can reduce <i>any</i> process to a series of steps. The question is what those steps embody. And here, aside from the unpatented test, they embody only the correlation between homocysteine and vitamin deficiency that the researchers uncovered. In my view, that correlation is an unpatentable \"natural phenomenon,\" and I can find nothing in claim 13 that adds anything more of significance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>If I am correct in my conclusion in Part III that the patent is invalid, then special public interest considera- tions reinforce my view that we should decide this case. To fail to do so threatens to leave the medical profession subject to the restrictions imposed by this individual patent and others of its kind. Those restrictions may inhibit doctors from using their best medical judgment; they may force doctors to spend unnecessary time and energy to enter into license agreements; they may divert resources from the medical task of health care to the legal task of searching patent files for similar simple correla- tions; they may raise the cost of healthcare while inhibit- ing its effective delivery. See Brief for American Clinical Laboratory Association as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 8-13.</p>\n<p>Even if Part III is wrong, however, it still would be valu- able to decide this case. Our doing so would help diminish legal uncertainty in the area, affecting a \"substantial number of patent claims.\" See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 12-14 (filed Aug. 26, 2005). It would per- mit those in the medical profession better to understand the nature of their legal obligations. It would help Con- gress determine whether legislation is needed. Cf. 35 U. S. C. \u00a7287(c) (limiting liability of medical practitioners for performance of certain medical and surgical proce- dures).</p>\n<p>In either event, a decision from this generalist Court could contribute to the important ongoing debate, among both specialists and generalists, as to whether the patent system, as currently administered and enforced, adequately reflects the \"careful balance\" that \"the federal patent laws. . . embod[y].\" <i>Bonito Boats, Inc.</i> v. <i>Thunder Craft Boats,</i> <i>Inc.,</i> 489 U.
