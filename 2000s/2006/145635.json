NGO\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 05\u2013416.      Argued March 22, 2006\u2014Decided June 22, 2006\nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA) requires a prisoner to\n  exhaust any available administrative remedies before challenging\n  prison conditions in federal court. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71997e(a). Respondent\n  filed a grievance with California prison officials about his prison con\n  ditions, but it was rejected as untimely under state law. He subse\n  quently sued petitioner officials under \u00a71983 in the Federal District\n  Court, which granted petitioners\u2019 motion to dismiss on the ground\n  that respondent had not fully exhausted his administrative remedies\n  under \u00a71997e(a). Reversing, the Ninth Circuit held that respondent\n  had exhausted those remedies because none remained available to\n  him.\nHeld: The PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement requires proper exhaustion\n of administrative remedies. Pp. 5\u201321.\n    (a) Petitioners claim that a prisoner must complete the administra\n tive review process in accordance with applicable procedural rules,\n including deadlines, as a precondition to bringing suit in federal\n court, but respondent contends that \u00a71997e(a) allows suit once ad\n ministrative remedies are no longer available, regardless of the rea\n son. To determine the correct interpretation, the Court looks for\n guidance to both administrative and habeas corpus law, where ex\n haustion is an important doctrine. Administrative law requires\n proper exhaustion of administrative remedies, which \u201cmeans using\n all steps that the agency holds out, and doing so properly.\u201d Pozo v.\n McCaughtry, 286 F. 3d 1022, 1024. Habeas law has substantively\n similar rules, though its terminology is different. Pp. 5\u201311.\n    (b) Given this background, the Court is persuaded that the PLRA\n requires proper exhaustion. Pp. 11\u201317.\n      (1) By referring to \u201csuch administrative remedies as are avail\n2                          WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    able,\u201d \u00a71997e(a)\u2019s text strongly suggests \u201cexhausted\u201d means what it\n    means in administrative law. P. 11.\n          (2) Construing \u00a71997e(a) to require proper exhaustion also serves\n    the PLRA\u2019s goals. It gives prisoners an effective incentive to make\n    full use of the prison grievance process, thus providing prisons with a\n    fair opportunity to correct their own errors. It reduces the quantity\n    of prisoner suits. And it improves the quality of those suits that are\n    filed because proper exhaustion often results in creation of an admin\n    istrative record helpful to the court. In contrast, respondent\u2019s inter\n    pretation would make the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion scheme totally ineffec\n    tive, since exhaustion\u2019s benefits can be realized only if the prison\n    grievance system is given a fair opportunity to consider the griev\n    ance. That cannot happen unless the grievant complies with the sys\n    tem\u2019s critical procedural rules. Respondent\u2019s arguments that his in\n    terpretation would filter out frivolous claims are unpersuasive.\n    Pp. 11\u201314.\n          (3) As interpreted by respondent, the PLRA exhaustion require\n    ment would be unprecedented. No statute or case purports to require\n    exhaustion while at the same time allowing a party to bypass delib\n    erately the administrative process by flouting the agency\u2019s procedural\n    rules. None of his models is apt. He first suggests that the PLRA re\n    quirement was patterned on habeas law as it existed between 1963\n    and 1977 when, under Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 438, a federal ha\n    beas claim could be procedurally defaulted only if the prisoner delib\n    erately bypassed state remedies. That would be fanciful, however.\n    The PLRA was enacted contemporaneously with the Antiterrorism\n    and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which gave federal habeas\n    review a structure markedly different from what existed before 1977.\n    Furthermore, respondent\u2019s interpretation would not duplicate that\n    scheme, for it would permit a prisoner to bypass deliberately admin\n    istrative review with no risk of sanction. Respondent next suggests\n    that the PLRA exhaustion requirement is patterned on \u00a714(b) of the\n    Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and \u00a7706(e) of Title\n    VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but neither provision is in any\n    sense an exhaustion provision. Pp. 14\u201317.\n       (c) Respondent\u2019s remaining arguments regarding \u00a71997e(a)\u2019s inter\n    pretation are also unconvincing.

S. C. \u00a71997e(a), by filing an untimely\nor otherwise procedurally defective administrative griev\nance or appeal. We hold that proper exhaustion of admin\nistrative remedies is necessary.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  Congress enacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act of\n1995 (PLRA), 110 Stat. 1321\u201371, as amended, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71997e et seq., in 1996 in the wake of a sharp rise in pris\noner litigation in the federal courts, see, e.g., Alexander v.\nHawk, 159 F. 3d 1321, 1324\u20131325 (CA11 1998) (citing\nstatistics). The PLRA contains a variety of provisions\ndesigned to bring this litigation under control. See, e.g.,\n\u00a71997e(c) (requiring district courts to weed out prisoner\nclaims that clearly lack merit); \u00a71997e(e) (prohibiting\nclaims for emotional injury without prior showing of\nphysical injury); \u00a71997e(d) (restricting attorney\u2019s fees).\n  A centerpiece of the PLRA\u2019s effort \u201cto reduce the quan\n2                    WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntity . . . of prisoner suits\u201d is an \u201cinvigorated\u201d exhaustion\nprovision, \u00a71997e(a). Porter v. Nussle, 534 U. S. 516, 524\n(2002). Before 1980, prisoners asserting constitutional\nclaims had no obligation to exhaust administrative reme\ndies. See Wilwording v. Swenson, 404 U. S. 249, 251 (1971)\n(per curiam). In the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Per\nsons Act, \u00a77, 94 Stat. 349, Congress enacted a weak ex\nhaustion provision, which authorized district courts to\nstay actions under Rev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 for\na limited time while a prisoner exhausted \u201csuch plain,\nspeedy, and effective administrative remedies as are\navailable.\u201d \u00a71997e(a)(1) (1994 ed.). \u201cExhaustion under\nthe 1980 prescription was in large part discretionary; it\ncould be ordered only if the State\u2019s prison grievance sys\ntem met specified federal standards, and even then, only\nif, in the particular case, the court believed the require\nment \u2018appropriate and in the interests of justice.\u2019 \u201d Nussle,\nsupra, at 523 (quoting \u00a71997e). In addition, this provision\ndid not require exhaustion if the prisoner sought only\nmoney damages and such relief was not available under\nthe relevant administrative scheme. See McCarthy v.\nMadigan, 503 U. S. 140, 150\u2013151 (1992).\n   The PLRA strengthened this exhaustion provision in\nseveral ways. Exhaustion is no longer left to the discre\ntion of the district court, but is mandatory. See Booth v.\nChurner, 532 U. S. 731, 739 (2001). Prisoners must now\nexhaust all \u201cavailable\u201d remedies, not just those that meet\nfederal standards. Indeed, as we held in Booth, a prisoner\nmust now exhaust administrative remedies even where\nthe relief sought\u2014monetary damages\u2014cannot be granted\nby the administrative process. Id., at 734. Finally, ex\nhaustion of available administrative remedies is required\nfor any suit challenging prison conditions, not just for\nsuits under \u00a71983. Nussle, supra, at 524.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006) \n          3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\n                              B\n\n   California has a grievance system for prisoners who\nseek to challenge their conditions of confinement. To\ninitiate the process, an inmate must fill out a simple form,\nDept. of Corrections, Inmate/Parolee Appeal Form, CDC\n602 (12/87) (hereinafter Form 602), that is made \u201creadily\navailable to all inmates.\u201d       Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15,\n\u00a73084.1(c) (2004). The inmate must fill out two parts of\nthe form: part A, which is labeled \u201cDescribe Problem,\u201d and\npart B, which is labeled \u201cAction Requested.\u201d Then, as\nexplained on Form 602 itself, the prisoner \u201cmust first\ninformally seek relief through discussion with the appro\npriate staff member.\u201d App. 40\u201341. The staff member fills\nin part C of Form 602 under the heading \u201cStaff Response\u201d\nand then returns the form to the inmate.\n   If the prisoner is dissatisfied with the result of the\ninformal review, or if informal review is waived by the\nState, the inmate may pursue a three-step review process.\nSee \u00a7\u00a73084.5(b)\u2013(d). Although California labels this \u201cfor\nmal\u201d review (apparently to distinguish this process from\nthe prior step), the three-step process is relatively simple.\nAt the first level, the prisoner must fill in part D of Form\n602, which states: \u201cIf you are dissatisfied, explain below.\u201d\nId., at 40. The inmate then must submit the form, to\ngether with a few other documents, to the Appeals Coordi\nnator within 15 working days\u2014three weeks\u2014of the action\ntaken. \u00a73084.6(c). This level may be bypassed by the\nAppeals Coordinator in certain circumstances. \u00a73084.5(b).\nWithin 15 working days after an inmate submits an ap\npeal, the reviewer must inform the inmate of the outcome\nby completing part E of Form 602 and returning the form\nto the inmate.\n   If the prisoner receives an adverse determination at this\nfirst level, or if this level is bypassed, the inmate may\nproceed to the second level of review conducted by the\nwarden. \u00a7\u00a73084.5(c), (e)(1). The inmate does this by\n4                   WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfilling in part F of Form 602 and submitting the form\nwithin 15 working days of the prior decision. Within 10\nworking days thereafter, the reviewer provides a decision\non a letter that is attached to the form. If the prisoner\u2019s\nclaim is again denied or the prisoner otherwise is dissatis\nfied with the result, the prisoner must explain the basis\nfor his or her dissatisfaction on part H of the form and\nmail the form to the Director of the California Department\nof Corrections and Rehabilitation within 15 working days.\n\u00a73084.5(e)(2). An inmate\u2019s appeal may be rejected where\n\u201c[t]ime limits for submitting the appeal are exceeded and\nthe appellant had the opportunity to file within the pre\nscribed time constraints.\u201d \u00a73084.3(c)(6).\n                              C\n  Respondent is a prisoner who was convicted for murder\nand is serving a life sentence in the California prison\nsystem. In October 2000, respondent was placed in ad\nministrative segregation for allegedly engaging in \u201cinap\npropriate activity\u201d in the prison chapel. Two months later,\nrespondent was returned to the general population, but\nrespondent claims that he was prohibited from participat\ning in \u201cspecial programs,\u201d including a variety of religious\nactivities. Approximately six months after that restriction\nwas imposed, respondent filed a grievance with prison\nofficials challenging that action. That grievance was\nrejected as untimely because it was not filed within 15\nworking days of the action being challenged.            See\n\u00a7\u00a73084.3(c)(6), 3084.6(c).\n  Respondent appealed that decision internally without\nsuccess, and subsequently sued petitioners\u2014California\ncorrectional officials\u2014under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 in Federal\nDistrict Court. The District Court granted petitioners\u2019\nmotion to dismiss because respondent had not fully ex\nhausted his administrative remedies as required by\n\u00a71997e(a).

The Ninth Cir\ncuit\u2019s decision, while consistent with the decision of a\ndivided panel of the Sixth Circuit in Thomas v. Woolum,\n337 F. 3d 720 (2003), conflicts with decisions of four other\nCourts of Appeals. See Pozo v. McCaughtry, 286 F. 3d\n1022, 1025 (CA7) (\u201cTo exhaust remedies, a prisoner must\nfile complaints and appeals in the place, and at the time,\nthe prison\u2019s administrative rules require\u201d), cert. denied,\n537 U. S. 949 (2002); Ross v. County of Bernalillo, 365\nF. 3d 1181, 1185\u20131186 (CA10 2004) (same); Spruill v.\nGillis, 372 F. 3d 218, 230 (CA3 2004) (same); Johnson v.\nMeadows, 418 F. 3d 1152, 1159 (CA11 2005) (same). We\ngranted certiorari to address this conflict, 546 U. S. ___\n(2005), and we now reverse.\n                           II \n\n                           A\n\n  The PLRA provides as follows:\n    \u201cNo action shall be brought with respect to prison\n    conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any\n    other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail,\n    prison, or other correctional facility until such admin\n    istrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d\n    \u00a71997e(a) (2000 ed.) (emphasis added).\n   There is no dispute that this language requires a pris\noner to \u201cexhaust\u201d administrative remedies, but the parties\ndiffer sharply in their understanding of the meaning of\nthis requirement. Petitioners argue that this provision\nrequires proper exhaustion. This means, according to\npetitioners, that a prisoner must complete the administra\ntive review process in accordance with the applicable\nprocedural rules, including deadlines, as a precondition to\n6                    WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbringing suit in federal court. Respondent, on the other\nhand, argues that this provision demands what he terms\n\u201cexhaustion simpliciter.\u201d Brief for Respondent 7. In his\nview, \u00a71997e(a) simply means that a prisoner may not\nbring suit in federal court until administrative remedies\nare no longer available. Under this interpretation, the\nreason why administrative remedies are no longer avail\nable is irrelevant. Bare unavailability suffices even if this\nresults from a prisoner\u2019s deliberate strategy of refraining\nfrom filing a timely grievance so that the litigation of the\nprisoner\u2019s claim can begin in federal court.\n   The key for determining which of these interpretations\nof \u00a71997e(a) is correct lies in the term of art \u201cexhausted.\u201d\nExhaustion is an important doctrine in both administra\ntive and habeas law, and we therefore look to those bodies\nof law for guidance.\n                             B\n   \u201cThe doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies\nis well established in the jurisprudence of administrative\nlaw.\u201d McKart v. United States, 395 U. S. 185, 193 (1969).\n\u201cThe doctrine provides \u2018that no one is entitled to judicial\nrelief for a supposed or threatened injury until the pre\nscribed administrative remedy has been exhausted.\u2019 \u201d\nIbid. (quoting Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 303\nU. S. 41, 50\u201351 (1938)). Exhaustion of administrative\nremedies serves two main purposes. See McCarthy, 503\nU. S., at 145.\n   First, exhaustion protects \u201cadministrative agency au\nthority.\u201d Ibid. Exhaustion gives an agency \u201can opportu\nnity to correct its own mistakes with respect to the pro\ngrams it administers before it is haled into federal court,\u201d\nand it discourages \u201cdisregard of [the agency\u2019s] procedures.\u201d\nIbid.\n   Second, exhaustion promotes efficiency.

In some cases, claims are settled at\nthe administrative level, and in others, the proceedings\nbefore the agency convince the losing party not to pursue\nthe matter in federal court. See ibid.; Parisi v. Davidson,\n405 U. S. 34, 37 (1972); McKart, supra, at 195. \u201cAnd even\nwhere a controversy survives administrative review, ex\nhaustion of the administrative procedure may produce a\nuseful record for subsequent judicial consideration.\u201d\nMcCarthy, supra, at 145.\n   Because of the advantages of administrative review,\nsome aggrieved parties will voluntarily exhaust all ave\nnues of administrative review before resorting to federal\ncourt, and for these parties an exhaustion requirement is\nobviously unnecessary. Statutes requiring exhaustion\nserve a purpose when a significant number of aggrieved\nparties, if given the choice, would not voluntarily exhaust.\nAggrieved parties may prefer not to exhaust administra\ntive remedies for a variety of reasons. Although exhaus\ntion promotes overall efficiency, a party may conclude\u2014\ncorrectly or incorrectly\u2014that exhaustion is not efficient in\nthat party\u2019s particular case. In addition, some aggrieved\nparties may prefer to proceed directly to federal court for\nother reasons, including bad faith.1 See Thomas, supra, at\n752\u2013753 (Rosen, J., dissenting in part and concurring in\njudgment).\n   Because exhaustion requirements are designed to deal\nwith parties who do not want to exhaust, administrative\nlaw creates an incentive for these parties to do what they\nwould otherwise prefer not to do, namely, to give the\nagency a fair and full opportunity to adjudicate their\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 One can conceive of an inmate\u2019s seeking to avoid creating an admin\n\nistrative record with someone that he or she views as a hostile fact-\nfinder, filing a lawsuit primarily as a method of making some correc\ntions official\u2019s life difficult, or perhaps even speculating that a suit will\nmean a welcome\u2014if temporary\u2014respite from his or her cell.\n8                        WOODFORD v.

Neither is sound.\n  First, the dissent contends that, \u201cin the absence of explicit statutory\ndirective,\u201d proper exhaustion is required only in proceedings that are in\nthe nature of \u201cappellate review proceedings.\u201d Post, at 9 (opinion of\nSTEVENS, J.). The only authorities cited in support of this proposition\nare Sims v. Apfel, 530 U.

See post, at 9 (citing Brief for Law\nProfessors 1). The amici brief argues that \u201c[t]he conceptual key to this\ncase is [the] distinction\u201d between an \u201coriginal proceeding,\u201d in which \u201cthe\ncourt is simply determining the legality of out-of-court action,\u201d and a\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

The habeas stat\nute generally requires a state prisoner to exhaust state\nremedies before filing a habeas petition in federal court.\nSee 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72254(b)(1), (c). \u201cThis rule of comity\nreduces friction between the state and federal court sys\ntems by avoiding the \u2018unseem[liness]\u2019 of a federal district\ncourt\u2019s overturning a state-court conviction without the\nstate courts having had an opportunity to correct the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201creview proceeding,\u201d in which the court must \u201creview the decision of\nsome other adjudicator.\u201d Id., at 2\u20133. According to the amici brief,\nhabeas petitions are prime examples of \u201creview proceeding[s]\u201d because\nthey \u201cask federal courts to review the decisions of state courts.\u201d Id., at\n3. This argument is deeply flawed.\n  \u201c[H]abeas corpus [is] an original . . . civil remedy for the enforcement\nof the right to personal liberty, rather than . . . a stage of the state\ncriminal proceedings . . . or as an appeal therefrom.\u201d Fay v. Noia, 372\nU. S. 391, 423\u2013424 (1963) (footnote omitted). And habeas law includes\nthe \u201cjudge-made doctrine of procedural default.\u201d Post, at 5, n. 4. This\nshows that the dissent and the amici brief are incorrect in contending\nthat a proper exhaustion requirement is incompatible with an original\nproceeding.\n  Second, the dissent argues that, even if administrative law generally\nrequires proper exhaustion, respondent falls within an exception to\nthat rule. Post, at 11. As the dissent puts it, \u201c[b]ecause respondent has\nraised constitutional claims, . . . the Court may not, as a matter of\nfederal common law, apply an extrastatutory waiver requirement\nagainst him.\u201d Ibid. But we are not applying an \u201cextrastatutory\u201d\nrequirement \u201cas a matter of federal common law.\u201d Ibid. We are inter\npreting and applying the statutory requirement set out in the PLRA\nexhaustion provision. We interpret the PLRA exhaustion provision to\nrequire proper exhaustion, not the unprecedented scheme of exhaustion\nsimpliciter that the respondent advocates. As for the suggestion that\nthe PLRA might be meant to require proper exhaustion of non-\nconstitutional claims but not constitutional claims, we fail to see how\nsuch a carve-out would serve Congress\u2019 purpose of addressing a flood of\nprisoner litigation in the federal courts, see supra, at 1, when the\noverwhelming majority of prisoner civil rights and prison condition\nsuits are based on the Constitution.\n10                   WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconstitutional violation in the first instance.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan\nv. Boerckel, 526 U. S. 838, 845 (1999) (alteration in origi\nnal). A state prisoner is generally barred from obtaining\nfederal habeas relief unless the prisoner has properly\npresented his or her claims through one \u201ccomplete round\nof the State\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d Ibid.\nIn practical terms, the law of habeas, like administra-\ntive law, requires proper exhaustion, and we have de\nscribed this feature of habeas law as follows: \u201cTo . . . \u2018pro\ntect the integrity\u2019 of the federal exhaustion rule, we ask\nnot only whether a prisoner has exhausted his state reme\ndies, but also whether he has properly exhausted those\nremedies . . . .\u201d Id., at 848 (citation omitted; emphasis in\noriginal).\n   The law of habeas, however, uses terminology that\ndiffers from that of administrative law. In habeas, the\nsanction for failing to exhaust properly (preclusion of\nreview in federal court) is given the separate name of\nprocedural default, although the habeas doctrines of ex\nhaustion and procedural default \u201care similar in purpose\nand design and implicate similar concerns,\u201d Keeney v.\nTamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1, 7 (1992). See also Coleman v.\nThompson, 501 U. S. 722, 731\u2013732 (1991). In habeas,\nstate-court remedies are described as having been \u201cex\nhausted\u201d when they are no longer available, regardless of\nthe reason for their unavailability. See Gray v. Nether\nland, 518 U. S. 152, 161 (1996). Thus, if state-court reme\ndies are no longer available because the prisoner failed to\ncomply with the deadline for seeking state-court review or\nfor taking an appeal, those remedies are technically ex\nhausted, ibid., but exhaustion in this sense does not\nautomatically entitle the habeas petitioner to litigate his\nor her claims in federal court. Instead, if the petitioner\nprocedurally defaulted those claims, the prisoner generally\nis barred from asserting those claims in a federal habeas\nproceeding.

S. C. \u00a71997e(a) strongly suggests that\nthe PLRA uses the term \u201cexhausted\u201d to mean what the\nterm means in administrative law, where exhaustion\nmeans proper exhaustion. Section 1997e(a) refers to \u201csuch\nadministrative remedies as are available,\u201d and thus points\nto the doctrine of exhaustion in administrative law.\n                              B\n   Construing \u00a71997e(a) to require proper exhaustion also\nfits with the general scheme of the PLRA, whereas re\nspondent\u2019s interpretation would turn that provision into a\nlargely useless appendage. The PLRA attempts to elimi\nnate unwarranted federal-court interference with the\nadministration of prisons,3 and thus seeks to \u201caffor[d]\ncorrections officials time and opportunity to address com\nplaints internally before allowing the initiation of a federal\ncase.\u201d Nussle, 534 U. S., at 525. See also Booth, 532 U. S.,\nat 739. The PLRA also was intended to \u201creduce the quan\ntity and improve the quality of prisoner suits.\u201d Nussle,\nsupra, at 524.\n   Requiring proper exhaustion serves all of these goals. It\ngives prisoners an effective incentive to make full use of\nthe prison grievance process and accordingly provides\nprisons with a fair opportunity to correct their own errors.\nThis is particularly important in relation to state correc\ntions systems because it is \u201cdifficult to imagine an activity\nin which a State has a stronger interest, or one that is\nmore intricately bound up with state laws, regulations,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a73626(b)(2) (termination of prison-conditions\n\nconsent decrees).\n12                       WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand procedures, than the administration of its prisons.\u201d\nPreiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 491\u2013492 (1973).\n   Proper exhaustion reduces the quantity of prisoner suits\nbecause some prisoners are successful in the administra\ntive process, and others are persuaded by the proceedings\nnot to file an action in federal court.4 Finally, proper\nexhaustion improves the quality of those prisoner suits\nthat are eventually filed because proper exhaustion often\nresults in the creation of an administrative record that is\nhelpful to the court. When a grievance is filed shortly\nafter the event giving rise to the grievance, witnesses can\nbe identified and questioned while memories are still\nfresh, and evidence can be gathered and preserved.\n   While requiring proper exhaustion serves the purposes\nof the PLRA, respondent\u2019s interpretation of \u00a71997e(a)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The  dissent\u2019s objection, post, at 4, that exhaustion simpliciter is\nenough to reduce frivolous prisoner suits is not well taken. First, what\nmatters is not whether proper exhaustion was necessary to reach that\ngoal, but whether proper exhaustion was mandated by Congress.\nSecond, the empirical support for the dissent\u2019s conclusion is weak. The\ndissent points to a drop in volume of prisoner litigation between 1995\nand 2000 and concludes that it was \u201cclearly a direct result of the\nPLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement.\u201d Post, at 12. But this mistakes\ncorrelation for causation: A requirement of exhaustion simpliciter will\nnot, absent a mollified prisoner, prevent a case from being docketed\u2014\nand thus appearing in the filing statistics the dissent cites. The credit\nfor reduced filings more likely belongs to the PLRA\u2019s enactment of 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71915A (requiring district courts to screen \u201cbefore docketing, if\nfeasible\u201d prisoner civil complaints), and its amendments to \u00a71915\n(forbidding frequent-filer prisoners from proceeding in forma pauperis).\nFinally, prisoner civil rights and prison conditions cases still account\nfor an outsized share of filings: From 2000 through 2005, such cases\nrepresented between 8.3% and 9.8% of the new filings in the federal\ndistrict courts, or on average about one new prisoner case every other\nweek for each of the nearly 1000 active and senior district judges across\nthe country. See Administrative Office of the United States Courts,\nJudicial Facts and Figures, tbls. 1.1, 4.4, 4.6, http://www.uscourts.gov/\njudicialfactsfigures/contents.html (as visited June 19, 2006, and avail\nable in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwould make the PLRA exhaustion scheme wholly ineffec\ntive. The benefits of exhaustion can be realized only if the\nprison grievance system is given a fair opportunity to\nconsider the grievance. The prison grievance system will\nnot have such an opportunity unless the grievant complies\nwith the system\u2019s critical procedural rules. A prisoner\nwho does not want to participate in the prison grievance\nsystem will have little incentive to comply with the sys\ntem\u2019s procedural rules unless noncompliance carries a\nsanction, and under respondent\u2019s interpretation of the\nPLRA noncompliance carries no significant sanction. For\nexample, a prisoner wishing to bypass available adminis\ntrative remedies could simply file a late grievance without\nproviding any reason for failing to file on time. If the\nprison then rejects the grievance as untimely, the prisoner\ncould proceed directly to federal court. And acceptance of\nthe late grievance would not thwart the prisoner\u2019s wish to\nbypass the administrative process; the prisoner could\neasily achieve this by violating other procedural rules\nuntil the prison administration has no alternative but to\ndismiss the grievance on procedural grounds. We are\nconfident that the PLRA did not create such a toothless\nscheme.\n   Respondent argues that his interpretation of the PLRA\u2019s\nexhaustion provision would filter out frivolous claims\nbecause, by the time the deadline for filing a grievance has\npassed, the inmate may no longer wish to file suit. Brief\nfor Respondent 43. But since the deadline for filing an\nadministrative grievance is generally not very long\u201414 to\n30 days according to the United States, see Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 29, and even less accord\ning to respondent, see Brief for Respondent 30, n. 17\u2014it is\ndoubtful that Congress thought requiring a prisoner to\nwait this long would provide much of a deterrent. Indeed,\nmany prisoners would probably find it difficult to prepare,\nfile, and serve a civil complaint before the expiration of the\n14                   WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndeadline for filing a grievance in many correctional\nsystems.\n  Respondent also contends that his interpretation of the\nPLRA exhaustion requirement would filter out frivolous\nclaims because prisoners could not simply wait until the\ndeadline for filing an administrative grievance had passed.\nAccording to respondent, \u201cmost grievance systems give\nadministrators the discretion to hear untimely griev\nances,\u201d and therefore a prisoner \u201cwill be required to file an\nuntimely grievance and thereby give the grievance sys\ntem\u201d the opportunity to address the complaint. Id., at 43.\nBut assuming for the sake of argument that the premise of\nthis argument is correct, i.e., that a court could never\nconclude that administrative remedies were unavailable\nunless an administrative decision had so held, but see\nColeman, 501 U. S., at 735, n., a prisoner who does not\nwant to participate in the prison grievance process would\nhave little difficulty in forcing the prison to dismiss his\nadministrative case on procedural grounds. Under the\nCalifornia system, for example, a prisoner has numerous\nopportunities to miss deadlines. Therefore, the task of\nengineering such a dismissal of a grievance on procedural\ngrounds is unlikely to be sufficient to alter the conduct of a\nprisoner whose objective is to bypass the administrative\nprocess.\n                             C\n   Finally, as interpreted by respondent, the PLRA ex\nhaustion requirement would be unprecedented. Respon\ndent has not pointed to any statute or case that purports\nto require exhaustion while at the same time allowing a\nparty to bypass deliberately the administrative process by\nflouting the agency\u2019s procedural rules. It is most unlikely\nthat the PLRA, which was intended to deal with what was\nperceived as a disruptive tide of frivolous prisoner litiga\ntion, adopted an exhaustion requirement that goes further\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthan any other model that has been called to our attention\nin permitting the wholesale bypassing of administrative\nremedies. Respondent identifies three models for the\nscheme of \u201cexhaustion simpliciter\u201d that he believes is set\nout in the PLRA, but none of these examples is apt.\n  Respondent first looks to habeas law as it existed prior\nto Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72 (1977). Before then,\na federal habeas claim could be procedurally defaulted\nonly if the prisoner deliberately bypassed state remedies.\nSee Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 438 (1963). It would be\nfanciful, however, to suggest that the PLRA exhaustion\nrequirement was patterned on habeas law as it existed in\nthe years between Fay and Wainwright. As respondent\nstresses, the PLRA was enacted contemporaneously with\nthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA), 110 Stat. 104, which gave federal habeas review\na structure markedly different from that which existed in\nthe period between Fay and Wainwright.\n  Furthermore, respondent\u2019s interpretation of \u00a71997e(a)\nwould not duplicate the scheme that existed in habeas\nduring that interval.     As interpreted by respondent,\n\u00a71997e(a) would permit a prisoner to bypass deliberately\nand flagrantly administrative review without any risk of\nsanction. Because it is unlikely that the PLRA was in\ntended to permit this, the two Courts of Appeals that have\nheld that \u00a71997e(a) does not require proper exhaustion\nboth pointedly stated that their decisions did not allow a\nprisoner to bypass deliberately administrative remedies.\nSee 403 F. 3d, at 629; Thomas, 337 F. 3d, at 732, and n. 4.\nNeither of these courts, however, explained how \u00a71997e(a)\ncan be interpreted in this way\u2014that is, so that it does not\nrequire proper exhaustion but somehow proscribes delib\nerate bypass.\n  Apparently recognizing that such an interpretation\nneither has a statutory basis nor refers to a concept of\nexhaustion from an existing body of law, respondent does\n16                  WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot contend that \u00a71997e(a) prohibits deliberate bypass; in\nhis view, all that \u00a71997e(a) demands is that a prisoner\nwait until any opportunity for administrative review has\nevaporated. But in making this argument, respondent\nasks us to hold that the PLRA was meant to adopt an\nexhaustion scheme that stands in sharp contrast to both\ncurrent and past habeas law and is unlike any other ex\nhaustion scheme that has been called to our attention.\n  Respondent next suggests that the PLRA exhaustion\nrequirement was patterned on \u00a714(b) of the Age Discrimi\nnation in Employment Act of 1967, (ADEA), 81 Stat. 607,\ncodified at 29 U. S. C. \u00a7633(b), and \u00a7706(e) of Title VII of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 260, as redesignated\nand amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20135(e), but these are im\nplausible models. Neither of these provisions makes\nreference to the concept of exhaustion, and neither is in\nany sense an exhaustion provision.\n  In Oscar Mayer & Co. v. Evans, 441 U. S. 750 (1979), we\nconsidered \u00a714(b) of the ADEA, which provides that, if a\nState has an agency to redress state-law age-related em\nployment-discrimination claims, an ADEA claim may not\nbe brought in federal court \u201cbefore the expiration of sixty\ndays after proceedings have been commenced under the\nState law.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7633(b) (emphasis added). This\nprovision makes no reference to the exhaustion of state\nremedies, only to the \u201ccommence[ment]\u201d of state proceed\nings, and this provision leaves no doubt that proper com\nmencement of those proceedings is not required. As we\nnoted, see Oscar Mayer, 441 U. S., at 759, \u00a714(b) of the\nADEA states that the requirement of commencement is\nsatisfied merely by sending the state agency a signed\nstatement of the pertinent facts, and \u00a714(b) explicitly\nprovides that the commencement requirement does not\nentail compliance with any other state procedural rule,\nincluding a deadline for initiating the state proceeding,\nid., at 760. We see little similarity between \u00a714(b), which\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmerely requires the commencement of state proceedings\nand explicitly does not require timely commencement, and\n42 U. S. C. \u00a71997e(a), which expressly requires exhaustion\nof available administrative remedies with no reference to a\nfederally based limiting principle.\n   Section 706(e) of Title VII is also fundamentally differ\nent from the PLRA exhaustion provision. As interpreted\nby this Court, \u00a7706(e) means that a complainant who\n\u201cinitially institutes proceedings with a state or local\nagency with authority to grant or seek relief from the\npractice charged\u201d must \u201cfile a charge\u201d with that agency, or\n\u201chave the EEOC refer the charge to that agency, within\n240 days of the alleged discriminatory event . . . .\u201d EEOC\nv. Commercial Office Products Co., 486 U. S. 107, 110\u2013111\n(1988). Following the reasoning of Oscar Mayer, we held\nthat this filing requirement did not demand that the\ncharge submitted to the state or local authority be filed in\ncompliance with the authority\u2019s time limit. 486 U. S., at\n123\u2013125. Because \u00a7706(e) of Title VII, refers only to the\nfiling of a charge with a state or local agency and not to\nthe exhaustion of remedies, \u00a7706(e) cannot be viewed as a\nmodel for the PLRA exhaustion provision.\n                              IV\n  Respondent\u2019s remaining arguments regarding the inter\npretation of 42 U. S. C. \u00a71997e(a) are unconvincing. Rely\ning on the use of the term \u201cuntil\u201d in the phrase \u201cuntil such\nadministrative remedies as are available are exhausted,\u201d\nrespondent contends that \u201c[t]he use of the temporal word\n\u2018until\u2019 . . . conveys a timing requirement: it assumes that\nthe question to be answered is simply whether the pris\noner can file suit now or must wait until later.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 11. Likewise, according to respondent, the\nuse of the present tense (\u201csuch administrative remedies as\nare available,\u201d \u00a71997e(a) (emphasis added)), requires \u201ca\nfocus on whether any administrative remedies are pres\n18                  WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nently available.\u201d Id., at 12. But saying that a party may\nnot sue in federal court until the party first pursues all\navailable avenues of administrative review necessarily\nmeans that, if the party never pursues all available ave\nnues of administrative review, the person will never be\nable to sue in federal court. Thus, \u00a71997e(a)\u2019s use of the\nterm \u201cuntil\u201d and the present tense does not support re\nspondent\u2019s position.\n   Respondent attaches significance to the fact that the\nPLRA exhaustion provision does not expressly state that a\nprisoner must have \u201cproperly exhausted\u201d available admin\nistrative remedies, whereas a tolling provision of the\nAEDPA provides that the time for filing a federal habeas\npetition is tolled during the period when \u201ca properly filed\napplication for State post-conviction or other collateral\nreview . . . is pending.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(2) (emphasis\nadded). In our view, respondent draws an unreasonable\ninference from the difference in the wording of these two\nprovisions. Although the AEDPA and the PLRA were\nenacted at roughly the same time, they are separate and\ndetailed pieces of legislation. Moreover, the AEDPA and\nPLRA provisions deal with separate issues: tolling in the\ncase of AEDPA and exhaustion in the case of the PLRA.\n   Respondent maintains that his interpretation of the\nPLRA exhaustion provision is bolstered by another PLRA\nprovision, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71997e(c)(2), that permits a district\ncourt to dismiss certain prisoner claims \u201cwithout first\nrequiring the exhaustion of administrative remedies.\u201d\nAccording to respondent, this provision shows that Con\ngress thought that, at the point when a district court\nmight make such a ruling (which would typically be well\nafter the filing of the complaint), a prisoner might still\nhave the opportunity to exhaust administrative remedies.\nBecause short administrative filing deadlines would make\nthis impossible, respondent contends, Congress cannot\nhave thought that a prisoner\u2019s failure to comply with those\n                    Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                  19\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndeadlines would preclude litigation in federal court.\n   Respondent\u2019s argument is unconvincing for at least two\nreasons. First, respondent has not shown that Congress\nhad reason to believe that every prison system would have\nrelatively short and categorical filing deadlines. Indeed,\nrespondent asserts that most grievance systems give\nadministrators the discretion to hear untimely grievances.\nSecond, even if dismissals under \u00a71997e(c)(2) typically\noccur when the opportunity to pursue administrative\nremedies has passed, \u00a71997e(c)(2) still serves a useful\nfunction by making it clear that the PLRA exhaustion\nrequirement is not jurisdictional, and thus allowing a\ndistrict court to dismiss plainly meritless claims without\nfirst addressing what may be a much more complex ques\ntion, namely, whether the prisoner did in fact properly\nexhaust available administrative remedies.5\n   Respondent next argues that the similarity between the\nwording of the PLRA exhaustion provision and the\nAEDPA exhaustion provision, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(c), shows\nthat the PLRA provision was meant to incorporate the\nnarrow technical definition of exhaustion that applies in\nhabeas. We reject this argument for two reasons.\n   First, there is nothing particularly distinctive about the\nwording of the habeas and PLRA exhaustion provisions.\nThey say what any exhaustion provision must say\u2014that a\njudicial remedy may not be sought or obtained unless,\nuntil, or before certain other remedies are exhausted. It\nis, therefore, unrealistic to infer from the wording of the\nPLRA provision that Congress framed and adopted that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Questions regarding the timeliness of prisoner filings occur fre\n\nquently. See, e.g., Wallace v. Burbury, 305 F. Supp. 2d 801, 806 (ND\nOhio 2003); Pusey v. Belanger, No. Civ. 02\u2013351\u2013SLR, 2004 WL 2075472\n(D. Del., Sept. 14, 2004); Eakle v.

NGO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprovision with habeas law and not administrative law in\nmind. Indeed, the wording of the PLRA provision (a pris\noner may not bring an action with respect to prison condi\ntions \u201cuntil such administrative remedies as are available\nare exhausted\u201d) is strikingly similar to our description of\nthe doctrine of administrative exhaustion (\u201c \u2018no one is\nentitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened\ninjury until the prescribed administrative remedy has been\nexhausted,\u2019 \u201d McKart, 395 U. S., at 193 (citation omitted;\nemphasis added)).\n   Second, respondent\u2019s suggestion that the PLRA was\nmeant to incorporate the same technical distinction that\nexists in habeas law without providing any sanction to\nprevent willful noncompliance\u2014not even the deliberate\nbypass standard of Fay\u2014would produce a scheme that in\npractical terms is radically different from the habeas\nscheme. Copying habeas\u2019 narrow definition of exhaustion\nwithout furnishing any sanction to promote compliance\nwould be like copying the design for an airplane but omit\nting one of the wings.\n   Respondent contends that requiring proper exhaustion\nwill lead prison administrators to devise procedural re\nquirements that are designed to trap unwary prisoners\nand thus to defeat their claims. Respondent does not\ncontend, however, that anything like this occurred in his\ncase, and it is speculative that this will occur in the future.\nCorrections officials concerned about maintaining order in\ntheir institutions have a reason for creating and retaining\ngrievance systems that provide\u2014and that are perceived by\nprisoners as providing\u2014a meaningful opportunity for\nprisoners to raise meritorious grievances. And with re\nspect to the possibility that prisons might create proce\ndural requirements for the purpose of tripping up all but\nthe most skillful prisoners, while Congress repealed the\n\u201cplain, speedy, and effective\u201d standard, see 42 U.

This argument over\nlooks the informality and relative simplicity of prison\ngrievance systems like California\u2019s, as well as the fact that\nprisoners who litigate in federal court generally proceed\npro se and are forced to comply with numerous unforgiving\ndeadlines and other procedural requirements.\n                       *     *    *\n  For these reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Court\nof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

I do not believe\nthat Congress desired a system in which prisoners could\nelect to bypass prison grievance systems without conse\nquences. Administrative law, however, contains well\nestablished exceptions to exhaustion. See Sims v. Apfel,\n530 U. S. 103, 115 (2000) (BREYER, J., joined by Rehnquist,\nC.

The ques\ntion in this case is whether, by enacting the exhaustion\nrequirement in the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995\n(PLRA), Congress intended to authorize state correction\nofficials to impose a comparable limitation on prisoners\u2019\nconstitutionally protected right of access to the federal\ncourts. The text of the statute, particularly when read in\nthe light of our well-settled jurisprudence, provides us with\nthe same unambiguous negative answer that common sense\nwould dictate.\n                            I\n  Congress enacted the following exhaustion requirement\nin the PLRA:\n    \u201cNo action shall be brought with respect to prison\n    conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any\n    other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail,\n2                        WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n     prison, or other correctional facility until such admin\n     istrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d 42\n     U. S. C. \u00a71997e(a).\n   This provision requires prisoners to exhaust informal\nremedies before filing a lawsuit under federal law. They\nmust file an administrative grievance and, if the resolu\ntion of that grievance is unsatisfactory to them, they must\nexhaust available administrative appeals. The statute,\nhowever, says nothing about the reasons why a grievance\nmay have been denied; it does not distinguish between a\ndenial on the merits and a denial based on a procedural\nerror. It does not attach any significance to a prison offi\ncial\u2019s decision that a prisoner has made procedural mis\nsteps in exhausting administrative remedies. In the\nwords of federal courts jurisprudence, the text of the\nPLRA does not impose a waiver, or a procedural default,\nsanction, upon those prisoners who make such procedural\nerrors. See Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 125\u2013126, n. 28\n(1982) (explaining that \u201cthe problem of waiver is separate\nfrom the question whether a state prisoner has exhausted\nstate remedies\u201d).1 The plain text of the PLRA simply\nrequires that \u201csuch administrative remedies as are avail\nable\u201d be exhausted before the prisoner can take the seri\nous step of filing a federal lawsuit against the officials who\nhold him in custody.\n   Today, however, the Court concludes that the \u201cPLRA\nexhaustion requirement requires proper exhaustion,\u201d ante,\nat 10. The absence of textual support for that conclusion\nis a sufficient reason for rejecting it. Unlike 28 U. S. C.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Because we have used the term \u201cwaiver\u201d in referring to this sanction\n\nin the habeas corpus context, I use that term in this opinion. Strictly\nspeaking, it would be more accurate to characterize this sanction as a\n\u201cforfeiture\u201d sanction, as there is no question that prisoners do not, by\nmaking a procedural error in the course of exhausting administrative\nremedies, purposefully relinquish their right to bring constitutional\nclaims in federal court.\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

S. C.\n\u00a71997e(a) lacks any textual requirement of proper exhaus\ntion. See Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S. 4, 8 (2000) (explaining\nthe importance of the textual requirement that an applica\ntion be \u201cproperly filed\u201d under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(2)). In\nstead, just as in the habeas context, under the PLRA a\nprisoner \u201cwho has [procedurally] defaulted his federal\nclaims in [a state prison grievance proceeding] meets the\ntechnical requirements for exhaustion; there are no state\nremedies any longer \u2018available\u2019 to him.\u201d Coleman v.\nThompson, 501 U. S. 722, 732 (1991). Accordingly, under the\nplain text of 42 U. S. C. \u00a71997e(a), respondent satisfied his\nduty to exhaust available administrative remedies before\nfiling a federal lawsuit.\n                             II\n  The majority essentially ignores the PLRA\u2019s text,2\nsuggesting instead that general administrative law princi\nples, which allow courts in certain circumstances to im\npose procedural default sanctions as a matter of federal\ncommon law, suggest we should read waiver into the\nPLRA. However, as discussed in Part III, infra, our cases\nmake clear that such extratextual waiver sanctions are\nonly appropriate if a statute directs a federal court to act\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The majority does not claim that the plain language of the statute\ndictates its decision, but rather that the text \u201cstrongly suggests\u201d that\nthe PLRA includes a procedural default sanction, ante, at 10. The\nmajority then states: \u201cSection 1997e(a) refers to \u2018such administrative\nremedies as are available,\u2019 and thus points to the doctrine of exhaustion\nin administrative law.\u201d Ibid. The reference to \u201cadministrative reme\ndies\u201d simply addresses the fact that the review procedures provided by\nprison officials are administrative in character rather than judicial. At\nany rate, as discussed in Part III, infra, the doctrine of exhaustion in\nadministrative law does not support the majority\u2019s engraftment of a\nprocedural default sanction into the PLRA.\n4                     WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nas an appellate tribunal directly reviewing the decision of\na federal agency. Because actions brought under Rev.\nStat. \u00a71979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, such as respondent\u2019s, are\nde novo proceedings in federal district court, the majority\u2019s\ninvocation of these common-law principles is seriously\nmisguided.\n   The majority\u2019s disregard of the plain text of the PLRA is\nespecially unjustified in light of the backdrop against\nwhich the statute was enacted. We presume, of course,\nthat Congress is familiar with this Court\u2019s precedents and\nexpects its legislation to be interpreted in conformity with\nthose precedents. See, e.g., Edelman v. Lynchburg College,\n535 U. S. 106, 117, n. 13 (2002); Porter v. Nussle, 534 U. S.\n516, 528 (2002); North Star Steel Co. v. Thomas, 515 U. S.\n29, 34 (1995). This strong presumption is even more forceful\nwhen the underlying precedent is \u201c \u2018unusually important.\u2019 \u201d\nGebser v. Lago Vista Independent School Dist., 524 U. S.\n274, 294, n. 1 (1998) (quoting Cannon v. University of Chi\ncago, 441 U. S. 677, 699 (1979)). Consistent with this pre\nsumption, if we have already provided a definitive interpre\ntation of the language in one statute, and Congress then\nuses nearly identical language in another statute, we will\ngive the language in the latter statute an identical interpre\ntation unless there is a clear indication in the text or legisla\ntive history that we should not do so. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 495 (1997). Under these\nelementary principles of statutory interpretation, the\nPLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement does not incorporate a\nprocedural default component.\n   As the Solicitor General correctly points out in his brief\nsupporting petitioners, \u201cthe PLRA\u2019s exhaustion provision\nis essentially identical to that of the habeas corpus stat\nute.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13.

The\nonly noteworthy distinction between the two provisions is\nthat 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(b)(1)(A) uses the word \u201cunless,\u201d\nwhereas 42 U. S. C. \u00a71997e(a) uses the word \u201cuntil.\u201d If\nanything, this distinction suggests that the exhaustion\nrequirement in the PLRA is less amenable to a waiver\nsanction than the comparable requirement in the habeas\nstatute: The word \u201cuntil\u201d indicates a temporal condition\nwhereas the word \u201cunless\u201d would have been more appro\npriate for a procedural bar.\n  Notwithstanding the use of the word \u201cunless\u201d in 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254(b)(1)(A), as the majority correctly recog\nnizes, we have held that state-court remedies are \u201cex\nhausted\u201d for the purposes of the federal habeas statute so\nlong as \u201cthey are no longer available, regardless of the\nreason for their unavailability,\u201d ante, at 9. In other words,\nthe exhaustion requirement in the federal habeas statute\ndoes not incorporate a procedural default sanction.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 See generally O\u2019Sullivan v.

Moreover, procedural default in habeas is closely related to the\nprinciple that this Court lacks certiorari jurisdiction to review a state-\ncourt judgment that rests on an adequate and independent state proce\ndural ground.

See Coleman, 501 U. S., at 731; Castille v.\nPeoples, 489 U. S. 346, 351 (1989); Teague v. Lane, 489\nU. S. 288, 298 (1989); Engle, 456 U. S., at 125, n. 8; Hum\nphrey v. Cady, 405 U.

S. 391, 434\u2013435 (1963).\n  The Court rejects the obvious analogy to habeas law\nbecause the wording of the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion provision is\nalso \u201cstrikingly similar to our description of the doctrine of\nadministrative exhaustion, (\u201c \u2018no one is entitled to judicial\nrelief for a supposed or threatened injury until the pre\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nconsiderations do not apply in the context of 42 U.

Foster, 407 U. S. 225, 242 (1972). Accordingly, the\nmajority correctly does not suggest that we incorporate our procedural\ndefault jurisprudence from the federal habeas context into prison condi\ntions suits under \u00a71983.\n   Nonetheless, I fear that the majority\u2019s analysis may actually create a\nharsher procedural default regime under the PLRA than the judge-\nmade procedural default doctrine in habeas law. But see Muhammad v.\nClose, 540 U.

S. 185, 193\n(1969), in turn citing Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding\nCorp., 303 U. S. 41, 50\u201351 (1938)). The language quoted by\nthe majority from our case law is indeed similar to the\nlanguage of the PLRA (and the habeas corpus statute).\nBut this provides no help to the majority: We clearly used\nthis language to describe only an exhaustion requirement,\nnot a procedural default sanction.\n   The quoted language originally appeared in Justice\nBrandeis\u2019 opinion in Myers, 303 U. S., at 50\u201351. Myers is a\nsimple exhaustion case: The question presented was\nwhether an employer could seek the immediate intervention\nof federal courts in response to a complaint filed with the\nNational Labor Relations Board that it had engaged in\nunfair labor practices, or whether it had to await the conclu\nsion of the Board\u2019s proceedings to avail itself of judicial\nreview. The case was purely about timing\u2014there was no\ndiscussion whatever of procedural default.\n   McKart clearly recognized that the language of Myers\nconcerned only exhaustion, not procedural default. Imme\ndiately after quoting Myers, the McKart Court discussed the\nbenefits of exhaustion (primarily avoiding premature inter\nruption of the agency process), and drew an analogy to\njudicial rules that limit interlocutory appeals, without\nmaking any reference to procedural default. See 395 U. S.,\nat 193\u2013194. It was not until later in the opinion that the\nMcKart Court turned to a discussion of the considerations\nunderlying the imposition of a procedural default sanction\nin cases \u201cwhere the administrative process is at an end and\na party seeks judicial review of a decision that was not\nappealed through the administrative process.\u201d Id., at 194.\n   In sum, the language the majority quotes from McKart\nfurther supports the presumption that Congress intended\nthe exhaustion requirement in the PLRA to be read in\nconformity with our decisions interpreting the exhaustion\n8                    WOODFORD v.

See ante, at 7\u20138. The Court\u2019s discussion of these\nbackground administrative law principles misapprehends\nour precedent.\n   As a general rule in the administrative law context,\ncourts should not \u201c \u2018topple over administrative decisions\nunless the administrative body has not only erred, but has\nerred against objection made at the appropriate time under\nits practice.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 8 (quoting United States v. L. A.\nTucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U. S. 33, 37 (1952)). This\ndoctrine is, \u201clike most judicial doctrines, subject to numer\nous exceptions. Application of the doctrine to specific\ncases requires an understanding of its purposes and of the\nparticular administrative scheme involved.\u201d McKart, 395\nU. S., at 193 (footnote omitted); see id., at 198\u2013201 (declin\ning to apply waiver doctrine in the circumstances of the case\nbefore it).\n   The waiver doctrine in administrative law is \u201clargely [a]\ncreatur[e] of statute.\u201d Sims v. Apfel, 530 U. S. 103, 107\n(2000). In other words, many statutes explicitly prohibit\ncourts from considering claims \u201c \u2018that ha[ve] not been\nurged\u2019 \u201d before the administrative agency.

Accordingly, the\nCourt\u2019s claim that a procedural default sanction is man\ndated by simply \u201cinterpreting and applying the statutory\nrequirement set out in the PLRA exhaustion provision,\u201d\nante, at 9, n. 2, is patently erroneous.\n   In the federal administrative law context we have also\nimposed waiver requirements even in the absence of ex\nplicit statutory directive. This judge-made rule, discussed\nextensively by the majority, see ante, at 6\u20138, however, is\nbased on \u201can analogy to the rule that appellate courts will\nnot consider arguments not raised before trial courts.\u201d\nSims, 530 U. S., at 108\u2013109. As amici curiae law profes\nsors explain, this is because, in the context of such appel\nlate review proceedings, procedural errors in the course of\nexhaustion naturally create bars to review because the\ndecision under review rests on a procedural ground. Brief\nfor Law Professors 1. Moreover, the rule that appellate\ntribunals will not consider claims not properly exhausted\nbelow prevents parties from being unfairly surprised on\nappeal by resolution of issues about which they lacked an\nopportunity or incentive to introduce evidence at trial.\nSee Sims, 530 U. S., at 109. Accordingly, whether a court\nshould impose a procedural default sanction for issues not\nproperly exhausted in a prior administrative proceeding\n\u201cdepends on the degree to which the analogy to normal\nadversarial litigation applies in a particular administra\ntive proceeding.\u201d Ibid. (citing L. A. Tucker Truck Lines\nand Hormel v. Helvering, 312 U. S. 552 (1941)). If the\nanalogy does not hold, we will not impose a procedural\ndefault sanction. See Sims, 530 U.

NGO\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   Applying these principles, it is clear that ordinary prin\nciples of administrative law do not justify engrafting\nprocedural default into the PLRA. The purpose of a 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71983 action such as that filed by respondent is\nnot to obtain direct review of an order entered in the\ngrievance procedure, but to obtain redress for an alleged\nviolation of federal law committed by state corrections\nofficials. See, e.g., Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U. S. 225, 242\n(1972). It is undisputed that the PLRA does nothing to\nchange the nature of the federal action under \u00a71983; pris\noners who bring such actions after exhausting their ad\nministrative remedies are entitled to de novo proceedings\nin the federal district court without any deference (on\nissues of law or fact) to any ruling in the administrative\ngrievance proceedings. In sum, because federal district\ncourt proceedings in prison condition litigation bear no\nresemblance to appellate review of lower court decisions,\nthe administrative law precedent cited by the majority\nmakes clear that we should not engraft a judge-made\nprocedural default sanction into the PLRA.7 The major\nity\u2019s misapprehension of our precedent is especially trou\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 11. Although the particu\nlar procedural error made during the exhaustion of administrative\nremedies was different in Sims than the procedural error at issue here,\nour analysis in Sims concerned the circumstances under which we\nshould or should not engraft a waiver sanction into the administrative\nexhaustion process generally. See 530 U. S., at 108\u2013112; id., at 112\u2013\n113 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); id.,\nat 114\u2013115 (BREYER, J., dissenting).\n   7 The majority\u2019s suggestion that habeas law indicates otherwise, see\n\nante, at 8 n. 2, is incorrect. As explained above, see n. 5, supra, the\njudge-made procedural default sanction in habeas law is based on\nunique considerations that do not apply to \u00a71983 suits. Our precedent\nconcerning judicial review of administrative proceedings, upon which\nthe majority purports to rely, see ante, at 11, makes clear that we will\nnot impose a waiver sanction when judicial review of the administra\ntive decision does not resemble appellate review of lower court\ndecisions.\n                    Cite as: 548 U.

Evans, 441 U. S. 750, 765, n. 13\n(1979)).8\n   Finally, the majority\u2019s invocation of judge-made admin\nistrative law principles fails for an entirely separate rea\nson: An \u201cestablished exception\u201d to the judge-made doc\ntrine of procedural default in review of administrative\nproceedings permits individuals to raise constitutional\ncomplaints for the first time in federal court, even if they\nfailed to raise those claims properly before the agency.\nSims, 530 U. S., at 115 (BREYER, J., joined by Rehnquist,\nC. J., and SCALIA and KENNEDY, JJ., dissenting) (citing\nMathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 329, n. 10 (1976)).\nBecause respondent has raised constitutional claims,\nunder our precedent, the Court may not, as a matter of\nfederal common law, apply an extrastatutory waiver re\nquirement against him.\n                            IV\n  The principal arguments offered by the Court in support\nof its holding are policy arguments that, in its view, are\ngrounded in the purposes of the PLRA.9 The majority\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The majority notes that many prisoners proceed pro se in federal\ncourt, where there are also time limits and other procedural require\nments. See ante, at 20. However, the timeliness and other procedural\nrequirements of prison grievance systems are generally far more\nstringent than those imposed by federal courts. See Brief for American\nCivil Liberties Union et al. as Amici Curiae 6, n. 1, 25\u201327; Brief for\nJerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization of Yale Law School as\nAmicus Curiae A1\u2013A7.\n  9 Of course, if the majority were serious that \u201cwhat matters is not\n\nwhether proper exhaustion was necessary to reach [policy goals], but\nwhether proper exhaustion was mandated by Congress,\u201d ante, at 12\n12                       WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncorrectly identifies two of the principal purposes of the\nPLRA: (1) affording corrections officials time and oppor\ntunity to address complaints internally before the initia\ntion of a federal lawsuit; and (2) reducing the quantity,\nand improving the quality, of prison litigation. Both of\nthese purposes would be served by the PLRA, even if the\nCourt did not engraft a procedural default sanction into\nthe statute.\n   The first policy concern identified by the majority does\nnot even arguably justify either a timeliness requirement\nor a procedural default sanction. Prison officials certainly\nhave the opportunity to address claims that were filed in\nsome procedurally defective manner; indeed, California,\nlike the vast majority of state prison systems, explicitly\ngives prison administrators an opportunity to hear un\ntimely or otherwise procedurally defective grievances.\nCal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a73084.3(c). See generally Roose\nvelt, Exhaustion Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act:\nThe Consequence of Procedural Error, 52 Emory L. J.\n1771, 1810, and n. 192 (2003) (hereinafter Roosevelt).\nBecause it is undisputed that the PLRA mandates that\nprisoners exhaust their administrative remedies before\nfiling a federal lawsuit, prison officials will have the op\nportunity to address prisoners\u2019 claims before a suit is\nfiled.10\n   Second, the PLRA has already had the effect of reducing\nthe quantity of prison litigation, without the need for an\nextrastatutory procedural default sanction. As petitioners\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nn. 4, its opinion would not rest almost entirely on policy arguments.\n  10 In this regard, the majority\u2019s reference to Coleman v. Thompson,\n\n501 U. S. 722, 735, n. (1991), see ante, at 14, is perplexing. If a prison\nregulation explicitly grants prison officials discretion to consider\nuntimely or otherwise procedurally defective grievances, of course\nprison grievance remedies would still be \u201cavailable,\u201d and thus unex\nhausted, if a prisoner had not even tried to file a grievance simply\nbecause it was untimely or otherwise procedurally defective.\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                   13\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthemselves point out, the number of civil rights suits filed\nby prisoners in federal court dropped from 41,679 in 1995\nto 25,504 in 2000, and the rate of prisoner filing dropped\neven more dramatically during that period, from 37 pris\noner suits per 1,000 inmates to 19 suits per 1,000 inmates.\nBy contrast, between 2000 and 2004, the rate of filing\nremained relatively constant, dropping only \u201cslight[ly]\u201d to\napproximately 16 suits per 1000 inmates. See Brief for\nPetitioners 21\u201322. The sharp drop in prison litigation\nbetween 1995 and 2000 occurred before the Seventh Cir\ncuit\u2019s opinion in Pozo v. McCaughtry, 286 F. 3d 1022\n(2002), which was the first appellate decision engrafting a\nprocedural default sanction into the PLRA. Prior to Pozo,\nthe federal courts had regularly assumed that the PLRA\ndid not create any procedural default sanction, and dis\nmissals for failure to exhaust were without prejudice. See\nRoosevelt 1780\u20131781 (discussing cases). Thus, the PLRA,\nincluding its simple exhaustion requirement, was suffi\ncient to reduce the quantity of prisoner suits without any\nprocedural default requirement. This is not surprising:\nBecause the exhaustion requirement always ensures that\nprison officials have an opportunity to address claims\nbrought by prisoners before a federal lawsuit, some pris\noners will be \u201csuccessful in the administrative process,\nand others are persuaded by the proceedings not to file an\naction in federal court,\u201d ante, at 12, in part because \u201cthe\nvery fact of being heard . . . can mollify passions,\u201d Booth v.\nChurner, 532 U. S. 731, 737 (2001).11\n  Ordinary exhaustion also improves the quality of pris\noner suits. By giving prison officials an opportunity to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 Without any support, the majority speculates that the drop in suits\n\nfiled by prisoners between 1995 and 2000 resulted from other provi\nsions of the PLRA. See ante, at 12, n. 4. Regardless, the aforemen\ntioned statistics demonstrate that the procedural default sanction\nimposed by the PLRA is unnecessary to reduce the quantity of prison\nlitigation.\n14                        WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\naddress a prisoner\u2019s grievance before the initiation of the\nlawsuit, ordinary exhaustion \u201coften results in the creation\nof an administrative record that is helpful to the court,\u201d\nante, at 12. 12\n   I acknowledge, of course, that the majority\u2019s creation of\na waiver sanction for procedural missteps during the\ncourse of exhaustion will have an even more significant\neffect in reducing the number of lawsuits filed by prison\ners. However, \u201cno legislation pursues its purposes at all\ncosts. Deciding what competing values will or will not be\nsacrificed to the achievement of a particular objective is\nthe very essence of legislative choice\u2014and it frustrates\nrather than effectuates legislative intent simplistically to\nassume that whatever furthers the statute\u2019s primary\nobjective must be the law.\u201d Rodriguez v. United States,\n480 U. S. 522, 525\u2013526 (1987) (per curiam) (emphasis\ndeleted).\n   The competing values that Congress sought to effectuate\nby enacting the PLRA were reducing the number of frivo\nlous filings, on one hand, while preserving prisoners\u2019\ncapacity to file meritorious claims, on the other. As ex\nplained by Senator Hatch when he introduced the legisla\ntion on the Senate floor, the PLRA was needed because the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 The  majority also argues that ensuring strict compliance with strict\nprison timeliness requirements (generally ranging from 48 hours to a\nmonth, see n. 15, infra) will improve the quality of prisoner litigation\nbecause if \u201ca grievance is filed shortly after the event giving rise to the\ngrievance, witnesses can be identified and questioned while memories\nare still fresh, and evidence can be gathered and preserved.\u201d Ante, at\n12. While these are advantages to filing grievances soon after the\nalleged injury occurs, courts regularly resolve \u00a71983 (and other) litiga\ntion without such draconian time limitations. At any rate, as discussed\nbelow, legislation does not pursue any one purpose at all costs, and the\nmarginal advantages of encouraging compliance with such short time\nlimitations do not justify judicially rewriting the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion\nrequirement by engrafting a procedural default sanction into the\nstatute.\n                   Cite as: 548 U.

Rec. 27042 (Sept. 29,\n1995). He continued: \u201cIndeed, I do not want to prevent\ninmates from raising legitimate claims. This legislation\nwill not prevent those claims from being raised.\u201d Ibid.\nSimilarly, as Senator Thurmond, a cosponsor of the bill,\nstated: \u201c[The PLRA] will allow meritorious claims to be\nfiled, but gives the judge broader discretion to prevent\nfrivolous and malicious lawsuits filed by prison inmates.\u201d\nId., at 27044.\n   But the procedural default sanction created by this\nCourt, unlike the exhaustion requirement created by\nCongress, bars litigation at random, irrespective of\nwhether a claim is meritorious or frivolous.13 Consider, for\nexample, an inmate who has been raped while in prison.\nSuch a scenario is far from hypothetical; in enacting the\nPrison Rape Elimination Act of 2003, 42 U. S. C. \u00a715601,\net seq. (2000 ed., Supp. III), Congress estimated that some\none million people have been sexually assaulted in the\nNation\u2019s prisons over the last 20 years, \u00a715601(2). Al\nthough not all of these tragic incidents result in constitu\ntional violations, the sovereign does have a constitutional\nduty to \u201cprovide humane conditions of confinement,\u201d\nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 832 (1994). Accord\ningly, those inmates who are sexually assaulted by guards,\nor whose sexual assaults by other inmates are facilitated\nby guards, have suffered grave deprivations of their\nEighth Amendment rights. Yet, the Court\u2019s engraftment\nof a procedural default sanction into the PLRA\u2019s exhaus\ntion requirement risks barring such claims when a pris\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Indeed, if anything, it will have a worse effect on meritorious\nclaims; prisoners who file frivolous claims are probably more likely\nto be repeat filers, and to learn the ins and outs of all procedural\nrequirements.\n16                       WOODFORD v.

How\never, prisoners generally lack both the incentive and the\ncapacity to engage in such evasive tactics. Because federal\ncourts do not provide any deference to administrative\ndecisions by prison officials and any later federal suit is de\nnovo, prisoners\u2014even prisoners who are acting in bad\nfaith\u2014lack an incentive to avoid filing an administrative\ngrievance unless they fear retaliation. Moreover, because\nprisoners must exhaust administrative remedies, prison\nofficials can always thwart efforts by prisoners to avoid\nthe grievance process by simply exercising their discretion\nto excuse any procedural defect in the presentation of the\nprisoners\u2019 claims.\n   At any rate, there is a simple solution that would allow\ncourts to punish prisoners who seek to deliberately bypass\nstate administrative remedies, but that would not impose\nthe draconian punishment of procedural default on prison\ners who make reasonable, good-faith efforts to comply with\nrelevant administrative rules but, out of fear of retalia\ntion, a reasonable mistake of law, or simple inadvertence,\nmake some procedural misstep along the way.

In\nfact, this criticism applies to the majority\u2019s engraftment of\nan overinclusive procedural default sanction into the\nPLRA. If this Court insists upon rewriting \u00a71997e(a) in\nlight of its understanding of the statute\u2019s purposes, surely\nthe majority should add to the statute no harsher a sanc\ntion for making a procedural error during exhaustion than\nis necessary to accomplish its policy goals.\n   Moreover, ordinary abstention principles allow federal\ndistrict courts to dismiss suits brought by prisoners who\nhave deliberately bypassed available state remedies.\nFederal courts have the power to decline jurisdiction in\nexceptional circumstances, including the need to promote\n\u201cwise judicial administration.\u201d Quackenbush v.

What\nthe majority has in mind by a \u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d is\nunclear, and this question is sure to breed a great deal of\nlitigation in federal courts in the years to come.\n   For example, in this case, respondent filed a second\ngrievance after his first grievance was rejected, arguing\nthat his first grievance was in fact timely because he was\nchallenging petitioners\u2019 continuing prohibition on his\ncapacity to participate in Catholic observances, such as\nConfession, Holy Week services, and Bible study. The\nprison again rejected this second grievance on timeliness\ngrounds, even though the denial of respondent\u2019s capacity\nto engage in religious activities was clearly ongoing, and\nthus had occurred within the prison\u2019s 15-day statute of\nlimitations. See 403 F. 3d 620, 622 (CA9 2005). Assuming\nrespondent explicitly requested the restoration of his right\nto engage in religious activities within 15 days of the filing\nof his second grievance and prison officials denied the\nrequest, did petitioners\u2019 grievance procedures fail to pro\nvide respondent with a \u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d to raise\nhis claim, because, in light of the continuing nature of the\ninjury respondent is challenging, his grievance was in fact\ntimely? Cf. Klehr v. A. O. Smith Corp., 521 U. S. 179, 189\n(1997) (explaining that, under the Clayton Act, each overt\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

Does a 48-hour limitations period furnish a\nmeaningful opportunity for a prisoner to raise meritorious\ngrievances in the context of a juvenile who has been raped\nand repeatedly assaulted, with the knowledge and assis\ntance of guards, while in detention? See Minix v. Pazera,\nNo. 1:04 CV 447 RM, 2005 WL 1799538, *2 (ND Ind., July\n27, 2005). Does a prison grievance system provide such a\nmeaningful opportunity when women prisoners fail to file\ntimely grievances relating to a pattern of rape and sexual\nharassment throughout a city\u2019s prisons, because they\ncorrectly fear retaliation if they file such complaints? See\nWomen Prisoners v. District of Columbia, 877 F. Supp. 634\n(DC 1994). Are such remedies meaningful when a pris\noner files a grievance concerning a prison official having\nencouraged him to commit suicide, which the prisoner\nreasonably thinks raises one claim, but which prison\nofficials interpret to raise two separate claims\u2014one re\nlated to the guard\u2019s comments and one related to the\nprisoner\u2019s failure to receive health care\u2014and thus dismiss\nfor violating a prison regulation against including more\nthan one claim in a single grievance? See Harper v.\nLaufenberg, No. 04\u2013C\u2013699\u2013C, 2005 WL 79009, *3 (WD\nWis., Jan. 6, 2005). What if prison officials dismiss a\ntimely filed appeal because the prisoner explains that the\nprison will take two weeks to finish making certain copies\nof relevant documents by sending a letter to the Secretary\nof the Department of Corrections, rather than to the Sec\nretary of Inmate Grievances and Appeals, as he should\nhave under the prison regulations? See Keys v. Craig, 160\nFed. Appx. 125 (CA3 2005) (per curiam).

NLRB,\n461 U. S. 731, 741 (1983). Accordingly, the Constitution\nguarantees that prisoners, like all citizens, have a reasona\nbly adequate opportunity to raise constitutional claims\nbefore impartial judges, see, e.g., Lewis v. Casey, 518 U. S.\n343, 351 (1996). Moreover, because access to the courts is a\nfundamental right, see id., at 346, government-drawn\nclassifications that impose substantial burdens on the\ncapacity of a group of citizens to exercise that right require\nsearching judicial examination under the Equal Protection\nClause, see, e.g., Lyng v. Automobile Workers, 485 U. S.\n360, 370 (1988).\n   The correct interpretation of the PLRA would obviate\nthe need for litigation over any of these issues. More\nimportant, the correct interpretation of the statute would\nrecognize that, in enacting the PLRA, Members of Con\ngress created a rational regime designed to reduce the\nquantity of frivolous prison litigation while adhering to\ntheir constitutional duty \u201cto respect the dignity of all\npersons,\u201d even \u201cthose convicted of heinous crimes.\u201d Roper\nv.

Argued March 22, 2006\u2014Decided June 22, 2006\nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA) requires a prisoner to\n  exhaust any available administrative remedies before challenging\n  prison conditions in federal court. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71997e(a). Respondent\n  filed a grievance with California prison officials about his prison con\n  ditions, but it was rejected as untimely under state law. He subse\n  quently sued petitioner officials under \u00a71983 in the Federal District\n  Court, which granted petitioners\u2019 motion to dismiss on the ground\n  that respondent had not fully exhausted his administrative remedies\n  under \u00a71997e(a). Reversing, the Ninth Circuit held that respondent\n  had exhausted those remedies because none remained available to\n  him.\nHeld: The PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement requires proper exhaustion\n of administrative remedies. Pp. 5\u201321.\n    (a) Petitioners claim that a prisoner must complete the administra\n tive review process in accordance with applicable procedural rules,\n including deadlines, as a precondition to bringing suit in federal\n court, but respondent contends that \u00a71997e(a) allows suit once ad\n ministrative remedies are no longer available, regardless of the rea\n son. To determine the correct interpretation, the Court looks for\n guidance to both administrative and habeas corpus law, where ex\n haustion is an important doctrine. Administrative law requires\n proper exhaustion of administrative remedies, which \u201cmeans using\n all steps that the agency holds out, and doing so properly.\u201d Pozo v.\n McCaughtry, 286 F. 3d 1022, 1024. Habeas law has substantively\n similar rules, though its terminology is different. Pp. 5\u201311.\n    (b) Given this background, the Court is persuaded that the PLRA\n requires proper exhaustion. Pp. 11\u201317.\n      (1) By referring to \u201csuch administrative remedies as are avail\n2                          WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    able,\u201d \u00a71997e(a)\u2019s text strongly suggests \u201cexhausted\u201d means what it\n    means in administrative law. P. 11.\n          (2) Construing \u00a71997e(a) to require proper exhaustion also serves\n    the PLRA\u2019s goals. It gives prisoners an effective incentive to make\n    full use of the prison grievance process, thus providing prisons with a\n    fair opportunity to correct their own errors. It reduces the quantity\n    of prisoner suits. And it improves the quality of those suits that are\n    filed because proper exhaustion often results in creation of an admin\n    istrative record helpful to the court. In contrast, respondent\u2019s inter\n    pretation would make the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion scheme totally ineffec\n    tive, since exhaustion\u2019s benefits can be realized only if the prison\n    grievance system is given a fair opportunity to consider the griev\n    ance. That cannot happen unless the grievant complies with the sys\n    tem\u2019s critical procedural rules. Respondent\u2019s arguments that his in\n    terpretation would filter out frivolous claims are unpersuasive.\n    Pp. 11\u201314.\n          (3) As interpreted by respondent, the PLRA exhaustion require\n    ment would be unprecedented. No statute or case purports to require\n    exhaustion while at the same time allowing a party to bypass delib\n    erately the administrative process by flouting the agency\u2019s procedural\n    rules. None of his models is apt. He first suggests that the PLRA re\n    quirement was patterned on habeas law as it existed between 1963\n    and 1977 when, under Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 438, a federal ha\n    beas claim could be procedurally defaulted only if the prisoner delib\n    erately bypassed state remedies. That would be fanciful, however.\n    The PLRA was enacted contemporaneously with the Antiterrorism\n    and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which gave federal habeas\n    review a structure markedly different from what existed before 1977.\n    Furthermore, respondent\u2019s interpretation would not duplicate that\n    scheme, for it would permit a prisoner to bypass deliberately admin\n    istrative review with no risk of sanction. Respondent next suggests\n    that the PLRA exhaustion requirement is patterned on \u00a714(b) of the\n    Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and \u00a7706(e) of Title\n    VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but neither provision is in any\n    sense an exhaustion provision. Pp. 14\u201317.\n       (c) Respondent\u2019s remaining arguments regarding \u00a71997e(a)\u2019s inter\n    pretation are also unconvincing.

S. C. \u00a71997e(a), by filing an untimely\nor otherwise procedurally defective administrative griev\nance or appeal. We hold that proper exhaustion of admin\nistrative remedies is necessary.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  Congress enacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act of\n1995 (PLRA), 110 Stat. 1321\u201371, as amended, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71997e et seq., in 1996 in the wake of a sharp rise in pris\noner litigation in the federal courts, see, e.g., Alexander v.\nHawk, 159 F. 3d 1321, 1324\u20131325 (CA11 1998) (citing\nstatistics). The PLRA contains a variety of provisions\ndesigned to bring this litigation under control. See, e.g.,\n\u00a71997e(c) (requiring district courts to weed out prisoner\nclaims that clearly lack merit); \u00a71997e(e) (prohibiting\nclaims for emotional injury without prior showing of\nphysical injury); \u00a71997e(d) (restricting attorney\u2019s fees).\n  A centerpiece of the PLRA\u2019s effort \u201cto reduce the quan\n2                    WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntity . . . of prisoner suits\u201d is an \u201cinvigorated\u201d exhaustion\nprovision, \u00a71997e(a). Porter v. Nussle, 534 U. S. 516, 524\n(2002). Before 1980, prisoners asserting constitutional\nclaims had no obligation to exhaust administrative reme\ndies. See Wilwording v. Swenson, 404 U. S. 249, 251 (1971)\n(per curiam). In the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Per\nsons Act, \u00a77, 94 Stat. 349, Congress enacted a weak ex\nhaustion provision, which authorized district courts to\nstay actions under Rev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 for\na limited time while a prisoner exhausted \u201csuch plain,\nspeedy, and effective administrative remedies as are\navailable.\u201d \u00a71997e(a)(1) (1994 ed.). \u201cExhaustion under\nthe 1980 prescription was in large part discretionary; it\ncould be ordered only if the State\u2019s prison grievance sys\ntem met specified federal standards, and even then, only\nif, in the particular case, the court believed the require\nment \u2018appropriate and in the interests of justice.\u2019 \u201d Nussle,\nsupra, at 523 (quoting \u00a71997e). In addition, this provision\ndid not require exhaustion if the prisoner sought only\nmoney damages and such relief was not available under\nthe relevant administrative scheme. See McCarthy v.\nMadigan, 503 U. S. 140, 150\u2013151 (1992).\n   The PLRA strengthened this exhaustion provision in\nseveral ways. Exhaustion is no longer left to the discre\ntion of the district court, but is mandatory. See Booth v.\nChurner, 532 U. S. 731, 739 (2001). Prisoners must now\nexhaust all \u201cavailable\u201d remedies, not just those that meet\nfederal standards. Indeed, as we held in Booth, a prisoner\nmust now exhaust administrative remedies even where\nthe relief sought\u2014monetary damages\u2014cannot be granted\nby the administrative process. Id., at 734. Finally, ex\nhaustion of available administrative remedies is required\nfor any suit challenging prison conditions, not just for\nsuits under \u00a71983.

S. ____ (2006) \n          3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\n                              B\n\n   California has a grievance system for prisoners who\nseek to challenge their conditions of confinement. To\ninitiate the process, an inmate must fill out a simple form,\nDept. of Corrections, Inmate/Parolee Appeal Form, CDC\n602 (12/87) (hereinafter Form 602), that is made \u201creadily\navailable to all inmates.\u201d       Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15,\n\u00a73084.1(c) (2004). The inmate must fill out two parts of\nthe form: part A, which is labeled \u201cDescribe Problem,\u201d and\npart B, which is labeled \u201cAction Requested.\u201d Then, as\nexplained on Form 602 itself, the prisoner \u201cmust first\ninformally seek relief through discussion with the appro\npriate staff member.\u201d App. 40\u201341. The staff member fills\nin part C of Form 602 under the heading \u201cStaff Response\u201d\nand then returns the form to the inmate.\n   If the prisoner is dissatisfied with the result of the\ninformal review, or if informal review is waived by the\nState, the inmate may pursue a three-step review process.\nSee \u00a7\u00a73084.5(b)\u2013(d). Although California labels this \u201cfor\nmal\u201d review (apparently to distinguish this process from\nthe prior step), the three-step process is relatively simple.\nAt the first level, the prisoner must fill in part D of Form\n602, which states: \u201cIf you are dissatisfied, explain below.\u201d\nId., at 40. The inmate then must submit the form, to\ngether with a few other documents, to the Appeals Coordi\nnator within 15 working days\u2014three weeks\u2014of the action\ntaken. \u00a73084.6(c). This level may be bypassed by the\nAppeals Coordinator in certain circumstances. \u00a73084.5(b).\nWithin 15 working days after an inmate submits an ap\npeal, the reviewer must inform the inmate of the outcome\nby completing part E of Form 602 and returning the form\nto the inmate.\n   If the prisoner receives an adverse determination at this\nfirst level, or if this level is bypassed, the inmate may\nproceed to the second level of review conducted by the\nwarden. \u00a7\u00a73084.5(c), (e)(1). The inmate does this by\n4                   WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfilling in part F of Form 602 and submitting the form\nwithin 15 working days of the prior decision. Within 10\nworking days thereafter, the reviewer provides a decision\non a letter that is attached to the form. If the prisoner\u2019s\nclaim is again denied or the prisoner otherwise is dissatis\nfied with the result, the prisoner must explain the basis\nfor his or her dissatisfaction on part H of the form and\nmail the form to the Director of the California Department\nof Corrections and Rehabilitation within 15 working days.\n\u00a73084.5(e)(2). An inmate\u2019s appeal may be rejected where\n\u201c[t]ime limits for submitting the appeal are exceeded and\nthe appellant had the opportunity to file within the pre\nscribed time constraints.\u201d \u00a73084.3(c)(6).\n                              C\n  Respondent is a prisoner who was convicted for murder\nand is serving a life sentence in the California prison\nsystem. In October 2000, respondent was placed in ad\nministrative segregation for allegedly engaging in \u201cinap\npropriate activity\u201d in the prison chapel. Two months later,\nrespondent was returned to the general population, but\nrespondent claims that he was prohibited from participat\ning in \u201cspecial programs,\u201d including a variety of religious\nactivities. Approximately six months after that restriction\nwas imposed, respondent filed a grievance with prison\nofficials challenging that action. That grievance was\nrejected as untimely because it was not filed within 15\nworking days of the action being challenged.            See\n\u00a7\u00a73084.3(c)(6), 3084.6(c).\n  Respondent appealed that decision internally without\nsuccess, and subsequently sued petitioners\u2014California\ncorrectional officials\u2014under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 in Federal\nDistrict Court. The District Court granted petitioners\u2019\nmotion to dismiss because respondent had not fully ex\nhausted his administrative remedies as required by\n\u00a71997e(a).

In his\nview, \u00a71997e(a) simply means that a prisoner may not\nbring suit in federal court until administrative remedies\nare no longer available. Under this interpretation, the\nreason why administrative remedies are no longer avail\nable is irrelevant. Bare unavailability suffices even if this\nresults from a prisoner\u2019s deliberate strategy of refraining\nfrom filing a timely grievance so that the litigation of the\nprisoner\u2019s claim can begin in federal court.\n   The key for determining which of these interpretations\nof \u00a71997e(a) is correct lies in the term of art \u201cexhausted.\u201d\nExhaustion is an important doctrine in both administra\ntive and habeas law, and we therefore look to those bodies\nof law for guidance.\n                             B\n   \u201cThe doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies\nis well established in the jurisprudence of administrative\nlaw.\u201d McKart v. United States, 395 U. S. 185, 193 (1969).\n\u201cThe doctrine provides \u2018that no one is entitled to judicial\nrelief for a supposed or threatened injury until the pre\nscribed administrative remedy has been exhausted.\u2019 \u201d\nIbid. (quoting Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 303\nU. S. 41, 50\u201351 (1938)). Exhaustion of administrative\nremedies serves two main purposes. See McCarthy, 503\nU. S., at 145.\n   First, exhaustion protects \u201cadministrative agency au\nthority.\u201d Ibid. Exhaustion gives an agency \u201can opportu\nnity to correct its own mistakes with respect to the pro\ngrams it administers before it is haled into federal court,\u201d\nand it discourages \u201cdisregard of [the agency\u2019s] procedures.\u201d\nIbid.\n   Second, exhaustion promotes efficiency.

In some cases, claims are settled at\nthe administrative level, and in others, the proceedings\nbefore the agency convince the losing party not to pursue\nthe matter in federal court. See ibid.; Parisi v. Davidson,\n405 U. S. 34, 37 (1972); McKart, supra, at 195. \u201cAnd even\nwhere a controversy survives administrative review, ex\nhaustion of the administrative procedure may produce a\nuseful record for subsequent judicial consideration.\u201d\nMcCarthy, supra, at 145.\n   Because of the advantages of administrative review,\nsome aggrieved parties will voluntarily exhaust all ave\nnues of administrative review before resorting to federal\ncourt, and for these parties an exhaustion requirement is\nobviously unnecessary. Statutes requiring exhaustion\nserve a purpose when a significant number of aggrieved\nparties, if given the choice, would not voluntarily exhaust.\nAggrieved parties may prefer not to exhaust administra\ntive remedies for a variety of reasons. Although exhaus\ntion promotes overall efficiency, a party may conclude\u2014\ncorrectly or incorrectly\u2014that exhaustion is not efficient in\nthat party\u2019s particular case. In addition, some aggrieved\nparties may prefer to proceed directly to federal court for\nother reasons, including bad faith.1 See Thomas, supra, at\n752\u2013753 (Rosen, J., dissenting in part and concurring in\njudgment).\n   Because exhaustion requirements are designed to deal\nwith parties who do not want to exhaust, administrative\nlaw creates an incentive for these parties to do what they\nwould otherwise prefer not to do, namely, to give the\nagency a fair and full opportunity to adjudicate their\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 One can conceive of an inmate\u2019s seeking to avoid creating an admin\n\nistrative record with someone that he or she views as a hostile fact-\nfinder, filing a lawsuit primarily as a method of making some correc\ntions official\u2019s life difficult, or perhaps even speculating that a suit will\nmean a welcome\u2014if temporary\u2014respite from his or her cell.\n8                        WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nclaims. Administrative law does this by requiring proper\nexhaustion of administrative remedies, which \u201cmeans\nusing all steps that the agency holds out, and doing so\nproperly (so that the agency addresses the issues on the\nmerits).\u201d Pozo, 286 F. 3d, at 1024 (emphasis in original).\nThis Court has described the doctrine as follows: \u201c[A]s a\ngeneral rule . . . courts should not topple over administra\ntive decisions unless the administrative body not only has\nerred, but has erred against objection made at the time\nappropriate under its practice.\u201d United States v.

Proper exhaustion\ndemands compliance with an agency\u2019s deadlines and other\ncritical procedural rules because no adjudicative system\ncan function effectively without imposing some orderly\nstructure on the course of its proceedings.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The dissent makes two chief arguments regarding the doctrine of\n\nexhaustion in administrative law. Neither is sound.\n  First, the dissent contends that, \u201cin the absence of explicit statutory\ndirective,\u201d proper exhaustion is required only in proceedings that are in\nthe nature of \u201cappellate review proceedings.\u201d Post, at 9 (opinion of\nSTEVENS, J.). The only authorities cited in support of this proposition\nare Sims v. Apfel, 530 U. S. 103, 108\u2013109 (2000)\u2014which concerns differ\nent questions, i.e., issue exhaustion and the distinction between adver\nsarial and non-adversarial proceedings\u2014and an amici brief, which in\nturns cites no supporting authority. See post, at 9 (citing Brief for Law\nProfessors 1). The amici brief argues that \u201c[t]he conceptual key to this\ncase is [the] distinction\u201d between an \u201coriginal proceeding,\u201d in which \u201cthe\ncourt is simply determining the legality of out-of-court action,\u201d and a\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

The habeas stat\nute generally requires a state prisoner to exhaust state\nremedies before filing a habeas petition in federal court.\nSee 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72254(b)(1), (c). \u201cThis rule of comity\nreduces friction between the state and federal court sys\ntems by avoiding the \u2018unseem[liness]\u2019 of a federal district\ncourt\u2019s overturning a state-court conviction without the\nstate courts having had an opportunity to correct the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201creview proceeding,\u201d in which the court must \u201creview the decision of\nsome other adjudicator.\u201d Id., at 2\u20133. According to the amici brief,\nhabeas petitions are prime examples of \u201creview proceeding[s]\u201d because\nthey \u201cask federal courts to review the decisions of state courts.\u201d Id., at\n3. This argument is deeply flawed.\n  \u201c[H]abeas corpus [is] an original . . . civil remedy for the enforcement\nof the right to personal liberty, rather than . . . a stage of the state\ncriminal proceedings . . . or as an appeal therefrom.\u201d Fay v. Noia, 372\nU. S. 391, 423\u2013424 (1963) (footnote omitted). And habeas law includes\nthe \u201cjudge-made doctrine of procedural default.\u201d Post, at 5, n. 4. This\nshows that the dissent and the amici brief are incorrect in contending\nthat a proper exhaustion requirement is incompatible with an original\nproceeding.\n  Second, the dissent argues that, even if administrative law generally\nrequires proper exhaustion, respondent falls within an exception to\nthat rule. Post, at 11. As the dissent puts it, \u201c[b]ecause respondent has\nraised constitutional claims, . . . the Court may not, as a matter of\nfederal common law, apply an extrastatutory waiver requirement\nagainst him.\u201d Ibid. But we are not applying an \u201cextrastatutory\u201d\nrequirement \u201cas a matter of federal common law.\u201d Ibid. We are inter\npreting and applying the statutory requirement set out in the PLRA\nexhaustion provision. We interpret the PLRA exhaustion provision to\nrequire proper exhaustion, not the unprecedented scheme of exhaustion\nsimpliciter that the respondent advocates. As for the suggestion that\nthe PLRA might be meant to require proper exhaustion of non-\nconstitutional claims but not constitutional claims, we fail to see how\nsuch a carve-out would serve Congress\u2019 purpose of addressing a flood of\nprisoner litigation in the federal courts, see supra, at 1, when the\noverwhelming majority of prisoner civil rights and prison condition\nsuits are based on the Constitution.\n10                   WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconstitutional violation in the first instance.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan\nv. Boerckel, 526 U. S. 838, 845 (1999) (alteration in origi\nnal). A state prisoner is generally barred from obtaining\nfederal habeas relief unless the prisoner has properly\npresented his or her claims through one \u201ccomplete round\nof the State\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d Ibid.\nIn practical terms, the law of habeas, like administra-\ntive law, requires proper exhaustion, and we have de\nscribed this feature of habeas law as follows: \u201cTo . . . \u2018pro\ntect the integrity\u2019 of the federal exhaustion rule, we ask\nnot only whether a prisoner has exhausted his state reme\ndies, but also whether he has properly exhausted those\nremedies . . . .\u201d Id., at 848 (citation omitted; emphasis in\noriginal).\n   The law of habeas, however, uses terminology that\ndiffers from that of administrative law. In habeas, the\nsanction for failing to exhaust properly (preclusion of\nreview in federal court) is given the separate name of\nprocedural default, although the habeas doctrines of ex\nhaustion and procedural default \u201care similar in purpose\nand design and implicate similar concerns,\u201d Keeney v.\nTamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1, 7 (1992). See also Coleman v.\nThompson, 501 U. S. 722, 731\u2013732 (1991). In habeas,\nstate-court remedies are described as having been \u201cex\nhausted\u201d when they are no longer available, regardless of\nthe reason for their unavailability. See Gray v. Nether\nland, 518 U. S. 152, 161 (1996). Thus, if state-court reme\ndies are no longer available because the prisoner failed to\ncomply with the deadline for seeking state-court review or\nfor taking an appeal, those remedies are technically ex\nhausted, ibid., but exhaustion in this sense does not\nautomatically entitle the habeas petitioner to litigate his\nor her claims in federal court. Instead, if the petitioner\nprocedurally defaulted those claims, the prisoner generally\nis barred from asserting those claims in a federal habeas\nproceeding.

S. C. \u00a71997e(a) strongly suggests that\nthe PLRA uses the term \u201cexhausted\u201d to mean what the\nterm means in administrative law, where exhaustion\nmeans proper exhaustion. Section 1997e(a) refers to \u201csuch\nadministrative remedies as are available,\u201d and thus points\nto the doctrine of exhaustion in administrative law.\n                              B\n   Construing \u00a71997e(a) to require proper exhaustion also\nfits with the general scheme of the PLRA, whereas re\nspondent\u2019s interpretation would turn that provision into a\nlargely useless appendage. The PLRA attempts to elimi\nnate unwarranted federal-court interference with the\nadministration of prisons,3 and thus seeks to \u201caffor[d]\ncorrections officials time and opportunity to address com\nplaints internally before allowing the initiation of a federal\ncase.\u201d Nussle, 534 U. S., at 525. See also Booth, 532 U. S.,\nat 739. The PLRA also was intended to \u201creduce the quan\ntity and improve the quality of prisoner suits.\u201d Nussle,\nsupra, at 524.\n   Requiring proper exhaustion serves all of these goals. It\ngives prisoners an effective incentive to make full use of\nthe prison grievance process and accordingly provides\nprisons with a fair opportunity to correct their own errors.\nThis is particularly important in relation to state correc\ntions systems because it is \u201cdifficult to imagine an activity\nin which a State has a stronger interest, or one that is\nmore intricately bound up with state laws, regulations,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a73626(b)(2) (termination of prison-conditions\n\nconsent decrees).\n12                       WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand procedures, than the administration of its prisons.\u201d\nPreiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 491\u2013492 (1973).\n   Proper exhaustion reduces the quantity of prisoner suits\nbecause some prisoners are successful in the administra\ntive process, and others are persuaded by the proceedings\nnot to file an action in federal court.4 Finally, proper\nexhaustion improves the quality of those prisoner suits\nthat are eventually filed because proper exhaustion often\nresults in the creation of an administrative record that is\nhelpful to the court. When a grievance is filed shortly\nafter the event giving rise to the grievance, witnesses can\nbe identified and questioned while memories are still\nfresh, and evidence can be gathered and preserved.\n   While requiring proper exhaustion serves the purposes\nof the PLRA, respondent\u2019s interpretation of \u00a71997e(a)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The  dissent\u2019s objection, post, at 4, that exhaustion simpliciter is\nenough to reduce frivolous prisoner suits is not well taken. First, what\nmatters is not whether proper exhaustion was necessary to reach that\ngoal, but whether proper exhaustion was mandated by Congress.\nSecond, the empirical support for the dissent\u2019s conclusion is weak. The\ndissent points to a drop in volume of prisoner litigation between 1995\nand 2000 and concludes that it was \u201cclearly a direct result of the\nPLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement.\u201d Post, at 12. But this mistakes\ncorrelation for causation: A requirement of exhaustion simpliciter will\nnot, absent a mollified prisoner, prevent a case from being docketed\u2014\nand thus appearing in the filing statistics the dissent cites. The credit\nfor reduced filings more likely belongs to the PLRA\u2019s enactment of 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71915A (requiring district courts to screen \u201cbefore docketing, if\nfeasible\u201d prisoner civil complaints), and its amendments to \u00a71915\n(forbidding frequent-filer prisoners from proceeding in forma pauperis).\nFinally, prisoner civil rights and prison conditions cases still account\nfor an outsized share of filings: From 2000 through 2005, such cases\nrepresented between 8.3% and 9.8% of the new filings in the federal\ndistrict courts, or on average about one new prisoner case every other\nweek for each of the nearly 1000 active and senior district judges across\nthe country. See Administrative Office of the United States Courts,\nJudicial Facts and Figures, tbls. 1.1, 4.4, 4.6, http://www.uscourts.gov/\njudicialfactsfigures/contents.html (as visited June 19, 2006, and avail\nable in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwould make the PLRA exhaustion scheme wholly ineffec\ntive. The benefits of exhaustion can be realized only if the\nprison grievance system is given a fair opportunity to\nconsider the grievance. The prison grievance system will\nnot have such an opportunity unless the grievant complies\nwith the system\u2019s critical procedural rules. A prisoner\nwho does not want to participate in the prison grievance\nsystem will have little incentive to comply with the sys\ntem\u2019s procedural rules unless noncompliance carries a\nsanction, and under respondent\u2019s interpretation of the\nPLRA noncompliance carries no significant sanction. For\nexample, a prisoner wishing to bypass available adminis\ntrative remedies could simply file a late grievance without\nproviding any reason for failing to file on time. If the\nprison then rejects the grievance as untimely, the prisoner\ncould proceed directly to federal court. And acceptance of\nthe late grievance would not thwart the prisoner\u2019s wish to\nbypass the administrative process; the prisoner could\neasily achieve this by violating other procedural rules\nuntil the prison administration has no alternative but to\ndismiss the grievance on procedural grounds. We are\nconfident that the PLRA did not create such a toothless\nscheme.\n   Respondent argues that his interpretation of the PLRA\u2019s\nexhaustion provision would filter out frivolous claims\nbecause, by the time the deadline for filing a grievance has\npassed, the inmate may no longer wish to file suit. Brief\nfor Respondent 43. But since the deadline for filing an\nadministrative grievance is generally not very long\u201414 to\n30 days according to the United States, see Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 29, and even less accord\ning to respondent, see Brief for Respondent 30, n. 17\u2014it is\ndoubtful that Congress thought requiring a prisoner to\nwait this long would provide much of a deterrent. Indeed,\nmany prisoners would probably find it difficult to prepare,\nfile, and serve a civil complaint before the expiration of the\n14                   WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndeadline for filing a grievance in many correctional\nsystems.\n  Respondent also contends that his interpretation of the\nPLRA exhaustion requirement would filter out frivolous\nclaims because prisoners could not simply wait until the\ndeadline for filing an administrative grievance had passed.\nAccording to respondent, \u201cmost grievance systems give\nadministrators the discretion to hear untimely griev\nances,\u201d and therefore a prisoner \u201cwill be required to file an\nuntimely grievance and thereby give the grievance sys\ntem\u201d the opportunity to address the complaint. Id., at 43.\nBut assuming for the sake of argument that the premise of\nthis argument is correct, i.e., that a court could never\nconclude that administrative remedies were unavailable\nunless an administrative decision had so held, but see\nColeman, 501 U. S., at 735, n., a prisoner who does not\nwant to participate in the prison grievance process would\nhave little difficulty in forcing the prison to dismiss his\nadministrative case on procedural grounds. Under the\nCalifornia system, for example, a prisoner has numerous\nopportunities to miss deadlines. Therefore, the task of\nengineering such a dismissal of a grievance on procedural\ngrounds is unlikely to be sufficient to alter the conduct of a\nprisoner whose objective is to bypass the administrative\nprocess.\n                             C\n   Finally, as interpreted by respondent, the PLRA ex\nhaustion requirement would be unprecedented. Respon\ndent has not pointed to any statute or case that purports\nto require exhaustion while at the same time allowing a\nparty to bypass deliberately the administrative process by\nflouting the agency\u2019s procedural rules. It is most unlikely\nthat the PLRA, which was intended to deal with what was\nperceived as a disruptive tide of frivolous prisoner litiga\ntion, adopted an exhaustion requirement that goes further\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthan any other model that has been called to our attention\nin permitting the wholesale bypassing of administrative\nremedies. Respondent identifies three models for the\nscheme of \u201cexhaustion simpliciter\u201d that he believes is set\nout in the PLRA, but none of these examples is apt.\n  Respondent first looks to habeas law as it existed prior\nto Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72 (1977). Before then,\na federal habeas claim could be procedurally defaulted\nonly if the prisoner deliberately bypassed state remedies.\nSee Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 438 (1963). It would be\nfanciful, however, to suggest that the PLRA exhaustion\nrequirement was patterned on habeas law as it existed in\nthe years between Fay and Wainwright. As respondent\nstresses, the PLRA was enacted contemporaneously with\nthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA), 110 Stat. 104, which gave federal habeas review\na structure markedly different from that which existed in\nthe period between Fay and Wainwright.\n  Furthermore, respondent\u2019s interpretation of \u00a71997e(a)\nwould not duplicate the scheme that existed in habeas\nduring that interval.     As interpreted by respondent,\n\u00a71997e(a) would permit a prisoner to bypass deliberately\nand flagrantly administrative review without any risk of\nsanction. Because it is unlikely that the PLRA was in\ntended to permit this, the two Courts of Appeals that have\nheld that \u00a71997e(a) does not require proper exhaustion\nboth pointedly stated that their decisions did not allow a\nprisoner to bypass deliberately administrative remedies.\nSee 403 F. 3d, at 629; Thomas, 337 F. 3d, at 732, and n. 4.\nNeither of these courts, however, explained how \u00a71997e(a)\ncan be interpreted in this way\u2014that is, so that it does not\nrequire proper exhaustion but somehow proscribes delib\nerate bypass.\n  Apparently recognizing that such an interpretation\nneither has a statutory basis nor refers to a concept of\nexhaustion from an existing body of law, respondent does\n16                  WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot contend that \u00a71997e(a) prohibits deliberate bypass; in\nhis view, all that \u00a71997e(a) demands is that a prisoner\nwait until any opportunity for administrative review has\nevaporated. But in making this argument, respondent\nasks us to hold that the PLRA was meant to adopt an\nexhaustion scheme that stands in sharp contrast to both\ncurrent and past habeas law and is unlike any other ex\nhaustion scheme that has been called to our attention.\n  Respondent next suggests that the PLRA exhaustion\nrequirement was patterned on \u00a714(b) of the Age Discrimi\nnation in Employment Act of 1967, (ADEA), 81 Stat. 607,\ncodified at 29 U. S. C. \u00a7633(b), and \u00a7706(e) of Title VII of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 260, as redesignated\nand amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20135(e), but these are im\nplausible models. Neither of these provisions makes\nreference to the concept of exhaustion, and neither is in\nany sense an exhaustion provision.\n  In Oscar Mayer & Co. v. Evans, 441 U. S. 750 (1979), we\nconsidered \u00a714(b) of the ADEA, which provides that, if a\nState has an agency to redress state-law age-related em\nployment-discrimination claims, an ADEA claim may not\nbe brought in federal court \u201cbefore the expiration of sixty\ndays after proceedings have been commenced under the\nState law.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7633(b) (emphasis added). This\nprovision makes no reference to the exhaustion of state\nremedies, only to the \u201ccommence[ment]\u201d of state proceed\nings, and this provision leaves no doubt that proper com\nmencement of those proceedings is not required. As we\nnoted, see Oscar Mayer, 441 U. S., at 759, \u00a714(b) of the\nADEA states that the requirement of commencement is\nsatisfied merely by sending the state agency a signed\nstatement of the pertinent facts, and \u00a714(b) explicitly\nprovides that the commencement requirement does not\nentail compliance with any other state procedural rule,\nincluding a deadline for initiating the state proceeding,\nid., at 760.

C. \u00a71997e(a), which expressly requires exhaustion\nof available administrative remedies with no reference to a\nfederally based limiting principle.\n   Section 706(e) of Title VII is also fundamentally differ\nent from the PLRA exhaustion provision. As interpreted\nby this Court, \u00a7706(e) means that a complainant who\n\u201cinitially institutes proceedings with a state or local\nagency with authority to grant or seek relief from the\npractice charged\u201d must \u201cfile a charge\u201d with that agency, or\n\u201chave the EEOC refer the charge to that agency, within\n240 days of the alleged discriminatory event . . . .\u201d EEOC\nv. Commercial Office Products Co., 486 U. S. 107, 110\u2013111\n(1988). Following the reasoning of Oscar Mayer, we held\nthat this filing requirement did not demand that the\ncharge submitted to the state or local authority be filed in\ncompliance with the authority\u2019s time limit. 486 U. S., at\n123\u2013125. Because \u00a7706(e) of Title VII, refers only to the\nfiling of a charge with a state or local agency and not to\nthe exhaustion of remedies, \u00a7706(e) cannot be viewed as a\nmodel for the PLRA exhaustion provision.\n                              IV\n  Respondent\u2019s remaining arguments regarding the inter\npretation of 42 U. S. C. \u00a71997e(a) are unconvincing. Rely\ning on the use of the term \u201cuntil\u201d in the phrase \u201cuntil such\nadministrative remedies as are available are exhausted,\u201d\nrespondent contends that \u201c[t]he use of the temporal word\n\u2018until\u2019 . . . conveys a timing requirement: it assumes that\nthe question to be answered is simply whether the pris\noner can file suit now or must wait until later.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 11. Likewise, according to respondent, the\nuse of the present tense (\u201csuch administrative remedies as\nare available,\u201d \u00a71997e(a) (emphasis added)), requires \u201ca\nfocus on whether any administrative remedies are pres\n18                  WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nently available.\u201d Id., at 12. But saying that a party may\nnot sue in federal court until the party first pursues all\navailable avenues of administrative review necessarily\nmeans that, if the party never pursues all available ave\nnues of administrative review, the person will never be\nable to sue in federal court. Thus, \u00a71997e(a)\u2019s use of the\nterm \u201cuntil\u201d and the present tense does not support re\nspondent\u2019s position.\n   Respondent attaches significance to the fact that the\nPLRA exhaustion provision does not expressly state that a\nprisoner must have \u201cproperly exhausted\u201d available admin\nistrative remedies, whereas a tolling provision of the\nAEDPA provides that the time for filing a federal habeas\npetition is tolled during the period when \u201ca properly filed\napplication for State post-conviction or other collateral\nreview . . . is pending.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(2) (emphasis\nadded). In our view, respondent draws an unreasonable\ninference from the difference in the wording of these two\nprovisions. Although the AEDPA and the PLRA were\nenacted at roughly the same time, they are separate and\ndetailed pieces of legislation. Moreover, the AEDPA and\nPLRA provisions deal with separate issues: tolling in the\ncase of AEDPA and exhaustion in the case of the PLRA.\n   Respondent maintains that his interpretation of the\nPLRA exhaustion provision is bolstered by another PLRA\nprovision, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71997e(c)(2), that permits a district\ncourt to dismiss certain prisoner claims \u201cwithout first\nrequiring the exhaustion of administrative remedies.\u201d\nAccording to respondent, this provision shows that Con\ngress thought that, at the point when a district court\nmight make such a ruling (which would typically be well\nafter the filing of the complaint), a prisoner might still\nhave the opportunity to exhaust administrative remedies.\nBecause short administrative filing deadlines would make\nthis impossible, respondent contends, Congress cannot\nhave thought that a prisoner\u2019s failure to comply with those\n                    Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                  19\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndeadlines would preclude litigation in federal court.\n   Respondent\u2019s argument is unconvincing for at least two\nreasons. First, respondent has not shown that Congress\nhad reason to believe that every prison system would have\nrelatively short and categorical filing deadlines. Indeed,\nrespondent asserts that most grievance systems give\nadministrators the discretion to hear untimely grievances.\nSecond, even if dismissals under \u00a71997e(c)(2) typically\noccur when the opportunity to pursue administrative\nremedies has passed, \u00a71997e(c)(2) still serves a useful\nfunction by making it clear that the PLRA exhaustion\nrequirement is not jurisdictional, and thus allowing a\ndistrict court to dismiss plainly meritless claims without\nfirst addressing what may be a much more complex ques\ntion, namely, whether the prisoner did in fact properly\nexhaust available administrative remedies.5\n   Respondent next argues that the similarity between the\nwording of the PLRA exhaustion provision and the\nAEDPA exhaustion provision, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(c), shows\nthat the PLRA provision was meant to incorporate the\nnarrow technical definition of exhaustion that applies in\nhabeas. We reject this argument for two reasons.\n   First, there is nothing particularly distinctive about the\nwording of the habeas and PLRA exhaustion provisions.\nThey say what any exhaustion provision must say\u2014that a\njudicial remedy may not be sought or obtained unless,\nuntil, or before certain other remedies are exhausted. It\nis, therefore, unrealistic to infer from the wording of the\nPLRA provision that Congress framed and adopted that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Questions regarding the timeliness of prisoner filings occur fre\n\nquently.

NGO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprovision with habeas law and not administrative law in\nmind. Indeed, the wording of the PLRA provision (a pris\noner may not bring an action with respect to prison condi\ntions \u201cuntil such administrative remedies as are available\nare exhausted\u201d) is strikingly similar to our description of\nthe doctrine of administrative exhaustion (\u201c \u2018no one is\nentitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened\ninjury until the prescribed administrative remedy has been\nexhausted,\u2019 \u201d McKart, 395 U. S., at 193 (citation omitted;\nemphasis added)).\n   Second, respondent\u2019s suggestion that the PLRA was\nmeant to incorporate the same technical distinction that\nexists in habeas law without providing any sanction to\nprevent willful noncompliance\u2014not even the deliberate\nbypass standard of Fay\u2014would produce a scheme that in\npractical terms is radically different from the habeas\nscheme. Copying habeas\u2019 narrow definition of exhaustion\nwithout furnishing any sanction to promote compliance\nwould be like copying the design for an airplane but omit\nting one of the wings.\n   Respondent contends that requiring proper exhaustion\nwill lead prison administrators to devise procedural re\nquirements that are designed to trap unwary prisoners\nand thus to defeat their claims. Respondent does not\ncontend, however, that anything like this occurred in his\ncase, and it is speculative that this will occur in the future.\nCorrections officials concerned about maintaining order in\ntheir institutions have a reason for creating and retaining\ngrievance systems that provide\u2014and that are perceived by\nprisoners as providing\u2014a meaningful opportunity for\nprisoners to raise meritorious grievances. And with re\nspect to the possibility that prisons might create proce\ndural requirements for the purpose of tripping up all but\nthe most skillful prisoners, while Congress repealed the\n\u201cplain, speedy, and effective\u201d standard, see 42 U.

This argument over\nlooks the informality and relative simplicity of prison\ngrievance systems like California\u2019s, as well as the fact that\nprisoners who litigate in federal court generally proceed\npro se and are forced to comply with numerous unforgiving\ndeadlines and other procedural requirements.\n                       *     *    *\n  For these reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Court\nof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

I do not believe\nthat Congress desired a system in which prisoners could\nelect to bypass prison grievance systems without conse\nquences. Administrative law, however, contains well\nestablished exceptions to exhaustion. See Sims v. Apfel,\n530 U. S. 103, 115 (2000) (BREYER, J., joined by Rehnquist,\nC. J., and SCALIA and KENNEDY, JJ., dissenting) (constitu\ntional claims); Shalala v. Illinois Council on Long Term\nCare, Inc., 529 U. S. 1, 13 (2000) (futility); McKart v. United\nStates, 395 U.

See post, at 5, n. 5\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting) (noting that habeas corpus law\npermits \u201cpetitioners to overcome procedural defaults if they\ncan show that the procedural rule is not firmly established\n2                    WOODFORD v.

The ques\ntion in this case is whether, by enacting the exhaustion\nrequirement in the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995\n(PLRA), Congress intended to authorize state correction\nofficials to impose a comparable limitation on prisoners\u2019\nconstitutionally protected right of access to the federal\ncourts. The text of the statute, particularly when read in\nthe light of our well-settled jurisprudence, provides us with\nthe same unambiguous negative answer that common sense\nwould dictate.\n                            I\n  Congress enacted the following exhaustion requirement\nin the PLRA:\n    \u201cNo action shall be brought with respect to prison\n    conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any\n    other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail,\n2                        WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n     prison, or other correctional facility until such admin\n     istrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d 42\n     U. S. C. \u00a71997e(a).\n   This provision requires prisoners to exhaust informal\nremedies before filing a lawsuit under federal law. They\nmust file an administrative grievance and, if the resolu\ntion of that grievance is unsatisfactory to them, they must\nexhaust available administrative appeals. The statute,\nhowever, says nothing about the reasons why a grievance\nmay have been denied; it does not distinguish between a\ndenial on the merits and a denial based on a procedural\nerror. It does not attach any significance to a prison offi\ncial\u2019s decision that a prisoner has made procedural mis\nsteps in exhausting administrative remedies. In the\nwords of federal courts jurisprudence, the text of the\nPLRA does not impose a waiver, or a procedural default,\nsanction, upon those prisoners who make such procedural\nerrors. See Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 125\u2013126, n. 28\n(1982) (explaining that \u201cthe problem of waiver is separate\nfrom the question whether a state prisoner has exhausted\nstate remedies\u201d).1 The plain text of the PLRA simply\nrequires that \u201csuch administrative remedies as are avail\nable\u201d be exhausted before the prisoner can take the seri\nous step of filing a federal lawsuit against the officials who\nhold him in custody.\n   Today, however, the Court concludes that the \u201cPLRA\nexhaustion requirement requires proper exhaustion,\u201d ante,\nat 10. The absence of textual support for that conclusion\nis a sufficient reason for rejecting it. Unlike 28 U. S. C.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Because we have used the term \u201cwaiver\u201d in referring to this sanction\n\nin the habeas corpus context, I use that term in this opinion. Strictly\nspeaking, it would be more accurate to characterize this sanction as a\n\u201cforfeiture\u201d sanction, as there is no question that prisoners do not, by\nmaking a procedural error in the course of exhausting administrative\nremedies, purposefully relinquish their right to bring constitutional\nclaims in federal court.\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

S. C.\n\u00a71997e(a) lacks any textual requirement of proper exhaus\ntion. See Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S. 4, 8 (2000) (explaining\nthe importance of the textual requirement that an applica\ntion be \u201cproperly filed\u201d under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(2)). In\nstead, just as in the habeas context, under the PLRA a\nprisoner \u201cwho has [procedurally] defaulted his federal\nclaims in [a state prison grievance proceeding] meets the\ntechnical requirements for exhaustion; there are no state\nremedies any longer \u2018available\u2019 to him.\u201d Coleman v.\nThompson, 501 U. S. 722, 732 (1991). Accordingly, under the\nplain text of 42 U. S. C. \u00a71997e(a), respondent satisfied his\nduty to exhaust available administrative remedies before\nfiling a federal lawsuit.\n                             II\n  The majority essentially ignores the PLRA\u2019s text,2\nsuggesting instead that general administrative law princi\nples, which allow courts in certain circumstances to im\npose procedural default sanctions as a matter of federal\ncommon law, suggest we should read waiver into the\nPLRA. However, as discussed in Part III, infra, our cases\nmake clear that such extratextual waiver sanctions are\nonly appropriate if a statute directs a federal court to act\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The majority does not claim that the plain language of the statute\ndictates its decision, but rather that the text \u201cstrongly suggests\u201d that\nthe PLRA includes a procedural default sanction, ante, at 10. The\nmajority then states: \u201cSection 1997e(a) refers to \u2018such administrative\nremedies as are available,\u2019 and thus points to the doctrine of exhaustion\nin administrative law.\u201d Ibid. The reference to \u201cadministrative reme\ndies\u201d simply addresses the fact that the review procedures provided by\nprison officials are administrative in character rather than judicial. At\nany rate, as discussed in Part III, infra, the doctrine of exhaustion in\nadministrative law does not support the majority\u2019s engraftment of a\nprocedural default sanction into the PLRA.\n4                     WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nas an appellate tribunal directly reviewing the decision of\na federal agency. Because actions brought under Rev.\nStat. \u00a71979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, such as respondent\u2019s, are\nde novo proceedings in federal district court, the majority\u2019s\ninvocation of these common-law principles is seriously\nmisguided.\n   The majority\u2019s disregard of the plain text of the PLRA is\nespecially unjustified in light of the backdrop against\nwhich the statute was enacted. We presume, of course,\nthat Congress is familiar with this Court\u2019s precedents and\nexpects its legislation to be interpreted in conformity with\nthose precedents. See, e.g., Edelman v. Lynchburg College,\n535 U. S. 106, 117, n. 13 (2002); Porter v. Nussle, 534 U. S.\n516, 528 (2002); North Star Steel Co. v. Thomas, 515 U. S.\n29, 34 (1995). This strong presumption is even more forceful\nwhen the underlying precedent is \u201c \u2018unusually important.\u2019 \u201d\nGebser v. Lago Vista Independent School Dist., 524 U. S.\n274, 294, n. 1 (1998) (quoting Cannon v. University of Chi\ncago, 441 U. S. 677, 699 (1979)). Consistent with this pre\nsumption, if we have already provided a definitive interpre\ntation of the language in one statute, and Congress then\nuses nearly identical language in another statute, we will\ngive the language in the latter statute an identical interpre\ntation unless there is a clear indication in the text or legisla\ntive history that we should not do so. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 495 (1997). Under these\nelementary principles of statutory interpretation, the\nPLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement does not incorporate a\nprocedural default component.\n   As the Solicitor General correctly points out in his brief\nsupporting petitioners, \u201cthe PLRA\u2019s exhaustion provision\nis essentially identical to that of the habeas corpus stat\nute.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13.

See 62 Stat. 967.\n  5 In habeas law it is a separate judge-made doctrine of procedural\n\ndefault, stemming from our decision in Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S.\n72 (1977), that may bar relief even though a claim has been exhausted.\nThis procedural default doctrine is based on unique considerations of\ncomity in the habeas context, including the need to ensure that the state\ncriminal trial remains the \u201cmain event\u201d rather than a \u201ctryout on the road\u201d\nfor a later federal habeas proceeding. Id., at 90 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Moreover, procedural default in habeas is closely related to the\nprinciple that this Court lacks certiorari jurisdiction to review a state-\ncourt judgment that rests on an adequate and independent state proce\ndural ground. See id., at 81\u201382. It is undisputed that these unique\n6                        WOODFORD v.

See Coleman, 501 U. S., at 731; Castille v.\nPeoples, 489 U. S. 346, 351 (1989); Teague v. Lane, 489\nU. S. 288, 298 (1989); Engle, 456 U. S., at 125, n. 8; Hum\nphrey v. Cady, 405 U. S. 504, 516 (1972); Fay v. Noia, 372\nU. S. 391, 434\u2013435 (1963).\n  The Court rejects the obvious analogy to habeas law\nbecause the wording of the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion provision is\nalso \u201cstrikingly similar to our description of the doctrine of\nadministrative exhaustion, (\u201c \u2018no one is entitled to judicial\nrelief for a supposed or threatened injury until the pre\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nconsiderations do not apply in the context of 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 suits,\nbecause the \u201cvery purpose of \u00a71983 was to interpose the federal courts\nbetween the States and the people, as guardians of the people\u2019s federal\nrights.\u201d Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U. S. 225, 242 (1972). Accordingly, the\nmajority correctly does not suggest that we incorporate our procedural\ndefault jurisprudence from the federal habeas context into prison condi\ntions suits under \u00a71983.\n   Nonetheless, I fear that the majority\u2019s analysis may actually create a\nharsher procedural default regime under the PLRA than the judge-\nmade procedural default doctrine in habeas law. But see Muhammad v.\nClose, 540 U. S. 749, 751 (2004) (per curiam) (stating that \u201c[p]risoners\nsuing under \u00a71983 . . . generally face a substantially lower gate [than\nprisoners seeking habeas corpus relief], even with the requirement of the\nPrison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that administrative opportunities be\nexhausted first\u201d (citing 42 U. S. C. \u00a71997e(a))). Our habeas jurisprudence\nallows petitioners to overcome procedural defaults if they can show that\nthe procedural rule is not firmly established and regularly followed, see\nJames v. Kentucky, 466 U. S. 341, 348 (1984), if they can demonstrate\ncause and prejudice to overcome a procedural default, or if enforcing\nthe procedural default rule would result in a miscarriage of justice, see\nMurray v.

S. 185, 193\n(1969), in turn citing Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding\nCorp., 303 U. S. 41, 50\u201351 (1938)). The language quoted by\nthe majority from our case law is indeed similar to the\nlanguage of the PLRA (and the habeas corpus statute).\nBut this provides no help to the majority: We clearly used\nthis language to describe only an exhaustion requirement,\nnot a procedural default sanction.\n   The quoted language originally appeared in Justice\nBrandeis\u2019 opinion in Myers, 303 U. S., at 50\u201351. Myers is a\nsimple exhaustion case: The question presented was\nwhether an employer could seek the immediate intervention\nof federal courts in response to a complaint filed with the\nNational Labor Relations Board that it had engaged in\nunfair labor practices, or whether it had to await the conclu\nsion of the Board\u2019s proceedings to avail itself of judicial\nreview. The case was purely about timing\u2014there was no\ndiscussion whatever of procedural default.\n   McKart clearly recognized that the language of Myers\nconcerned only exhaustion, not procedural default. Imme\ndiately after quoting Myers, the McKart Court discussed the\nbenefits of exhaustion (primarily avoiding premature inter\nruption of the agency process), and drew an analogy to\njudicial rules that limit interlocutory appeals, without\nmaking any reference to procedural default. See 395 U. S.,\nat 193\u2013194. It was not until later in the opinion that the\nMcKart Court turned to a discussion of the considerations\nunderlying the imposition of a procedural default sanction\nin cases \u201cwhere the administrative process is at an end and\na party seeks judicial review of a decision that was not\nappealed through the administrative process.\u201d Id., at 194.\n   In sum, the language the majority quotes from McKart\nfurther supports the presumption that Congress intended\nthe exhaustion requirement in the PLRA to be read in\nconformity with our decisions interpreting the exhaustion\n8                    WOODFORD v.

See ante, at 7\u20138. The Court\u2019s discussion of these\nbackground administrative law principles misapprehends\nour precedent.\n   As a general rule in the administrative law context,\ncourts should not \u201c \u2018topple over administrative decisions\nunless the administrative body has not only erred, but has\nerred against objection made at the appropriate time under\nits practice.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 8 (quoting United States v. L. A.\nTucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U. S. 33, 37 (1952)). This\ndoctrine is, \u201clike most judicial doctrines, subject to numer\nous exceptions. Application of the doctrine to specific\ncases requires an understanding of its purposes and of the\nparticular administrative scheme involved.\u201d McKart, 395\nU. S., at 193 (footnote omitted); see id., at 198\u2013201 (declin\ning to apply waiver doctrine in the circumstances of the case\nbefore it).\n   The waiver doctrine in administrative law is \u201clargely [a]\ncreatur[e] of statute.\u201d Sims v. Apfel, 530 U. S. 103, 107\n(2000). In other words, many statutes explicitly prohibit\ncourts from considering claims \u201c \u2018that ha[ve] not been\nurged\u2019 \u201d before the administrative agency. Id., at 108\n(quoting National Labor Relations Act, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7160(e)\n(1982 ed.)). See L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, 344 U. S., at 36,\nn. 6 (collecting statutes). It is important to emphasize\nthat statutory waiver requirements always mandate, by\ntheir plain terms, that courts shall not consider arguments\nnot properly raised before the agency; we have never\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

Accordingly, the\nCourt\u2019s claim that a procedural default sanction is man\ndated by simply \u201cinterpreting and applying the statutory\nrequirement set out in the PLRA exhaustion provision,\u201d\nante, at 9, n. 2, is patently erroneous.\n   In the federal administrative law context we have also\nimposed waiver requirements even in the absence of ex\nplicit statutory directive. This judge-made rule, discussed\nextensively by the majority, see ante, at 6\u20138, however, is\nbased on \u201can analogy to the rule that appellate courts will\nnot consider arguments not raised before trial courts.\u201d\nSims, 530 U. S., at 108\u2013109. As amici curiae law profes\nsors explain, this is because, in the context of such appel\nlate review proceedings, procedural errors in the course of\nexhaustion naturally create bars to review because the\ndecision under review rests on a procedural ground. Brief\nfor Law Professors 1. Moreover, the rule that appellate\ntribunals will not consider claims not properly exhausted\nbelow prevents parties from being unfairly surprised on\nappeal by resolution of issues about which they lacked an\nopportunity or incentive to introduce evidence at trial.\nSee Sims, 530 U. S., at 109. Accordingly, whether a court\nshould impose a procedural default sanction for issues not\nproperly exhausted in a prior administrative proceeding\n\u201cdepends on the degree to which the analogy to normal\nadversarial litigation applies in a particular administra\ntive proceeding.\u201d Ibid. (citing L. A. Tucker Truck Lines\nand Hormel v. Helvering, 312 U. S. 552 (1941)). If the\nanalogy does not hold, we will not impose a procedural\ndefault sanction. See Sims, 530 U. S., at 108\u2013110.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The majority\u2019s attempt to distinguish Sims as concerning \u201cdifferent\n\nquestions,\u201d ante, at 8, n. 2, is perplexing, particularly in light of the fact\nthat the United States, in its brief supporting petitioners, relies on\nSims to argue that our administrative law decisions support the propo\nsition that the Court should impose a waiver sanction into the PLRA.\n10                       WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   Applying these principles, it is clear that ordinary prin\nciples of administrative law do not justify engrafting\nprocedural default into the PLRA. The purpose of a 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71983 action such as that filed by respondent is\nnot to obtain direct review of an order entered in the\ngrievance procedure, but to obtain redress for an alleged\nviolation of federal law committed by state corrections\nofficials. See, e.g., Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U. S. 225, 242\n(1972). It is undisputed that the PLRA does nothing to\nchange the nature of the federal action under \u00a71983; pris\noners who bring such actions after exhausting their ad\nministrative remedies are entitled to de novo proceedings\nin the federal district court without any deference (on\nissues of law or fact) to any ruling in the administrative\ngrievance proceedings. In sum, because federal district\ncourt proceedings in prison condition litigation bear no\nresemblance to appellate review of lower court decisions,\nthe administrative law precedent cited by the majority\nmakes clear that we should not engraft a judge-made\nprocedural default sanction into the PLRA.7 The major\nity\u2019s misapprehension of our precedent is especially trou\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 11. Although the particu\nlar procedural error made during the exhaustion of administrative\nremedies was different in Sims than the procedural error at issue here,\nour analysis in Sims concerned the circumstances under which we\nshould or should not engraft a waiver sanction into the administrative\nexhaustion process generally. See 530 U. S., at 108\u2013112; id., at 112\u2013\n113 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); id.,\nat 114\u2013115 (BREYER, J., dissenting).\n   7 The majority\u2019s suggestion that habeas law indicates otherwise, see\n\nante, at 8 n. 2, is incorrect. As explained above, see n. 5, supra, the\njudge-made procedural default sanction in habeas law is based on\nunique considerations that do not apply to \u00a71983 suits. Our precedent\nconcerning judicial review of administrative proceedings, upon which\nthe majority purports to rely, see ante, at 11, makes clear that we will\nnot impose a waiver sanction when judicial review of the administra\ntive decision does not resemble appellate review of lower court\ndecisions.\n                    Cite as: 548 U.

Evans, 441 U. S. 750, 765, n. 13\n(1979)).8\n   Finally, the majority\u2019s invocation of judge-made admin\nistrative law principles fails for an entirely separate rea\nson: An \u201cestablished exception\u201d to the judge-made doc\ntrine of procedural default in review of administrative\nproceedings permits individuals to raise constitutional\ncomplaints for the first time in federal court, even if they\nfailed to raise those claims properly before the agency.\nSims, 530 U. S., at 115 (BREYER, J., joined by Rehnquist,\nC. J., and SCALIA and KENNEDY, JJ., dissenting) (citing\nMathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 329, n. 10 (1976)).\nBecause respondent has raised constitutional claims,\nunder our precedent, the Court may not, as a matter of\nfederal common law, apply an extrastatutory waiver re\nquirement against him.\n                            IV\n  The principal arguments offered by the Court in support\nof its holding are policy arguments that, in its view, are\ngrounded in the purposes of the PLRA.9 The majority\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The majority notes that many prisoners proceed pro se in federal\ncourt, where there are also time limits and other procedural require\nments. See ante, at 20. However, the timeliness and other procedural\nrequirements of prison grievance systems are generally far more\nstringent than those imposed by federal courts. See Brief for American\nCivil Liberties Union et al. as Amici Curiae 6, n. 1, 25\u201327; Brief for\nJerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization of Yale Law School as\nAmicus Curiae A1\u2013A7.\n  9 Of course, if the majority were serious that \u201cwhat matters is not\n\nwhether proper exhaustion was necessary to reach [policy goals], but\nwhether proper exhaustion was mandated by Congress,\u201d ante, at 12\n12                       WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncorrectly identifies two of the principal purposes of the\nPLRA: (1) affording corrections officials time and oppor\ntunity to address complaints internally before the initia\ntion of a federal lawsuit; and (2) reducing the quantity,\nand improving the quality, of prison litigation. Both of\nthese purposes would be served by the PLRA, even if the\nCourt did not engraft a procedural default sanction into\nthe statute.\n   The first policy concern identified by the majority does\nnot even arguably justify either a timeliness requirement\nor a procedural default sanction. Prison officials certainly\nhave the opportunity to address claims that were filed in\nsome procedurally defective manner; indeed, California,\nlike the vast majority of state prison systems, explicitly\ngives prison administrators an opportunity to hear un\ntimely or otherwise procedurally defective grievances.\nCal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a73084.3(c). See generally Roose\nvelt, Exhaustion Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act:\nThe Consequence of Procedural Error, 52 Emory L. J.\n1771, 1810, and n. 192 (2003) (hereinafter Roosevelt).\nBecause it is undisputed that the PLRA mandates that\nprisoners exhaust their administrative remedies before\nfiling a federal lawsuit, prison officials will have the op\nportunity to address prisoners\u2019 claims before a suit is\nfiled.10\n   Second, the PLRA has already had the effect of reducing\nthe quantity of prison litigation, without the need for an\nextrastatutory procedural default sanction. As petitioners\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nn. 4, its opinion would not rest almost entirely on policy arguments.\n  10 In this regard, the majority\u2019s reference to Coleman v. Thompson,\n\n501 U. S. 722, 735, n. (1991), see ante, at 14, is perplexing. If a prison\nregulation explicitly grants prison officials discretion to consider\nuntimely or otherwise procedurally defective grievances, of course\nprison grievance remedies would still be \u201cavailable,\u201d and thus unex\nhausted, if a prisoner had not even tried to file a grievance simply\nbecause it was untimely or otherwise procedurally defective.\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                   13\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthemselves point out, the number of civil rights suits filed\nby prisoners in federal court dropped from 41,679 in 1995\nto 25,504 in 2000, and the rate of prisoner filing dropped\neven more dramatically during that period, from 37 pris\noner suits per 1,000 inmates to 19 suits per 1,000 inmates.\nBy contrast, between 2000 and 2004, the rate of filing\nremained relatively constant, dropping only \u201cslight[ly]\u201d to\napproximately 16 suits per 1000 inmates. See Brief for\nPetitioners 21\u201322. The sharp drop in prison litigation\nbetween 1995 and 2000 occurred before the Seventh Cir\ncuit\u2019s opinion in Pozo v. McCaughtry, 286 F. 3d 1022\n(2002), which was the first appellate decision engrafting a\nprocedural default sanction into the PLRA. Prior to Pozo,\nthe federal courts had regularly assumed that the PLRA\ndid not create any procedural default sanction, and dis\nmissals for failure to exhaust were without prejudice. See\nRoosevelt 1780\u20131781 (discussing cases). Thus, the PLRA,\nincluding its simple exhaustion requirement, was suffi\ncient to reduce the quantity of prisoner suits without any\nprocedural default requirement. This is not surprising:\nBecause the exhaustion requirement always ensures that\nprison officials have an opportunity to address claims\nbrought by prisoners before a federal lawsuit, some pris\noners will be \u201csuccessful in the administrative process,\nand others are persuaded by the proceedings not to file an\naction in federal court,\u201d ante, at 12, in part because \u201cthe\nvery fact of being heard . . . can mollify passions,\u201d Booth v.\nChurner, 532 U. S. 731, 737 (2001).11\n  Ordinary exhaustion also improves the quality of pris\noner suits. By giving prison officials an opportunity to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 Without any support, the majority speculates that the drop in suits\n\nfiled by prisoners between 1995 and 2000 resulted from other provi\nsions of the PLRA. See ante, at 12, n. 4. Regardless, the aforemen\ntioned statistics demonstrate that the procedural default sanction\nimposed by the PLRA is unnecessary to reduce the quantity of prison\nlitigation.\n14                        WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\naddress a prisoner\u2019s grievance before the initiation of the\nlawsuit, ordinary exhaustion \u201coften results in the creation\nof an administrative record that is helpful to the court,\u201d\nante, at 12. 12\n   I acknowledge, of course, that the majority\u2019s creation of\na waiver sanction for procedural missteps during the\ncourse of exhaustion will have an even more significant\neffect in reducing the number of lawsuits filed by prison\ners. However, \u201cno legislation pursues its purposes at all\ncosts. Deciding what competing values will or will not be\nsacrificed to the achievement of a particular objective is\nthe very essence of legislative choice\u2014and it frustrates\nrather than effectuates legislative intent simplistically to\nassume that whatever furthers the statute\u2019s primary\nobjective must be the law.\u201d Rodriguez v. United States,\n480 U. S. 522, 525\u2013526 (1987) (per curiam) (emphasis\ndeleted).\n   The competing values that Congress sought to effectuate\nby enacting the PLRA were reducing the number of frivo\nlous filings, on one hand, while preserving prisoners\u2019\ncapacity to file meritorious claims, on the other. As ex\nplained by Senator Hatch when he introduced the legisla\ntion on the Senate floor, the PLRA was needed because the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 The  majority also argues that ensuring strict compliance with strict\nprison timeliness requirements (generally ranging from 48 hours to a\nmonth, see n. 15, infra) will improve the quality of prisoner litigation\nbecause if \u201ca grievance is filed shortly after the event giving rise to the\ngrievance, witnesses can be identified and questioned while memories\nare still fresh, and evidence can be gathered and preserved.\u201d Ante, at\n12. While these are advantages to filing grievances soon after the\nalleged injury occurs, courts regularly resolve \u00a71983 (and other) litiga\ntion without such draconian time limitations. At any rate, as discussed\nbelow, legislation does not pursue any one purpose at all costs, and the\nmarginal advantages of encouraging compliance with such short time\nlimitations do not justify judicially rewriting the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion\nrequirement by engrafting a procedural default sanction into the\nstatute.\n                   Cite as: 548 U.

Rec. 27042 (Sept. 29,\n1995). He continued: \u201cIndeed, I do not want to prevent\ninmates from raising legitimate claims. This legislation\nwill not prevent those claims from being raised.\u201d Ibid.\nSimilarly, as Senator Thurmond, a cosponsor of the bill,\nstated: \u201c[The PLRA] will allow meritorious claims to be\nfiled, but gives the judge broader discretion to prevent\nfrivolous and malicious lawsuits filed by prison inmates.\u201d\nId., at 27044.\n   But the procedural default sanction created by this\nCourt, unlike the exhaustion requirement created by\nCongress, bars litigation at random, irrespective of\nwhether a claim is meritorious or frivolous.13 Consider, for\nexample, an inmate who has been raped while in prison.\nSuch a scenario is far from hypothetical; in enacting the\nPrison Rape Elimination Act of 2003, 42 U. S. C. \u00a715601,\net seq. (2000 ed., Supp. III), Congress estimated that some\none million people have been sexually assaulted in the\nNation\u2019s prisons over the last 20 years, \u00a715601(2). Al\nthough not all of these tragic incidents result in constitu\ntional violations, the sovereign does have a constitutional\nduty to \u201cprovide humane conditions of confinement,\u201d\nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 832 (1994). Accord\ningly, those inmates who are sexually assaulted by guards,\nor whose sexual assaults by other inmates are facilitated\nby guards, have suffered grave deprivations of their\nEighth Amendment rights. Yet, the Court\u2019s engraftment\nof a procedural default sanction into the PLRA\u2019s exhaus\ntion requirement risks barring such claims when a pris\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Indeed, if anything, it will have a worse effect on meritorious\nclaims; prisoners who file frivolous claims are probably more likely\nto be repeat filers, and to learn the ins and outs of all procedural\nrequirements.\n16                       WOODFORD v.

How\never, prisoners generally lack both the incentive and the\ncapacity to engage in such evasive tactics. Because federal\ncourts do not provide any deference to administrative\ndecisions by prison officials and any later federal suit is de\nnovo, prisoners\u2014even prisoners who are acting in bad\nfaith\u2014lack an incentive to avoid filing an administrative\ngrievance unless they fear retaliation. Moreover, because\nprisoners must exhaust administrative remedies, prison\nofficials can always thwart efforts by prisoners to avoid\nthe grievance process by simply exercising their discretion\nto excuse any procedural defect in the presentation of the\nprisoners\u2019 claims.\n   At any rate, there is a simple solution that would allow\ncourts to punish prisoners who seek to deliberately bypass\nstate administrative remedies, but that would not impose\nthe draconian punishment of procedural default on prison\ners who make reasonable, good-faith efforts to comply with\nrelevant administrative rules but, out of fear of retalia\ntion, a reasonable mistake of law, or simple inadvertence,\nmake some procedural misstep along the way.

In\nfact, this criticism applies to the majority\u2019s engraftment of\nan overinclusive procedural default sanction into the\nPLRA. If this Court insists upon rewriting \u00a71997e(a) in\nlight of its understanding of the statute\u2019s purposes, surely\nthe majority should add to the statute no harsher a sanc\ntion for making a procedural error during exhaustion than\nis necessary to accomplish its policy goals.\n   Moreover, ordinary abstention principles allow federal\ndistrict courts to dismiss suits brought by prisoners who\nhave deliberately bypassed available state remedies.\nFederal courts have the power to decline jurisdiction in\nexceptional circumstances, including the need to promote\n\u201cwise judicial administration.\u201d Quackenbush v. Allstate\nIns. Co., 517 U. S. 706, 716 (1996) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Indeed, in Fay, we emphasized the dis\ncretion of district court judges in embracing precisely such\na deliberate bypass regime in the habeas corpus statute.\nSee 372 U. S., at 438. Applying such a deliberate bypass\nsanction to the PLRA would ensure that prisoners who act\nin bad faith are penalized, while not interfering with the\ncapacity of other inmates to litigate meritorious constitu\ntional claims.\n   In sum, the version of the PLRA Congress actually\nenacted, which includes an exhaustion requirement but\nnot a procedural default sanction, is plainly sufficient to\nadvance the policy values identified by the Court. More\nover, if, as the Court worries, there are many prisoners\nwho act in bad faith and purposely eschew administrative\nremedies, the imposition of a deliberate bypass standard\n18                   WOODFORD v. NGO\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nwould resolve that problem, without depriving litigants\nwho act in good faith but nonetheless make a procedural\nerror from obtaining judicial relief relating to their valid\nconstitutional claims. The majority\u2019s holding is as unsup\nported by the policy concerns it discusses as it is by the\ntext of the statute.\n                                V\n   The majority leaves open the question whether a pris\noner\u2019s failure to comply properly with procedural require\nments that do not provide a \u201cmeaningful opportunity for\nprisoners to raise meritorious grievances\u201d would bar the\nlater filing of a suit in federal court. Ante, at 19\u201320. What\nthe majority has in mind by a \u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d is\nunclear, and this question is sure to breed a great deal of\nlitigation in federal courts in the years to come.\n   For example, in this case, respondent filed a second\ngrievance after his first grievance was rejected, arguing\nthat his first grievance was in fact timely because he was\nchallenging petitioners\u2019 continuing prohibition on his\ncapacity to participate in Catholic observances, such as\nConfession, Holy Week services, and Bible study. The\nprison again rejected this second grievance on timeliness\ngrounds, even though the denial of respondent\u2019s capacity\nto engage in religious activities was clearly ongoing, and\nthus had occurred within the prison\u2019s 15-day statute of\nlimitations. See 403 F. 3d 620, 622 (CA9 2005). Assuming\nrespondent explicitly requested the restoration of his right\nto engage in religious activities within 15 days of the filing\nof his second grievance and prison officials denied the\nrequest, did petitioners\u2019 grievance procedures fail to pro\nvide respondent with a \u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d to raise\nhis claim, because, in light of the continuing nature of the\ninjury respondent is challenging, his grievance was in fact\ntimely?

Are such remedies meaningful when a pris\noner files a grievance concerning a prison official having\nencouraged him to commit suicide, which the prisoner\nreasonably thinks raises one claim, but which prison\nofficials interpret to raise two separate claims\u2014one re\nlated to the guard\u2019s comments and one related to the\nprisoner\u2019s failure to receive health care\u2014and thus dismiss\nfor violating a prison regulation against including more\nthan one claim in a single grievance?

NLRB,\n461 U. S. 731, 741 (1983). Accordingly, the Constitution\nguarantees that prisoners, like all citizens, have a reasona\nbly adequate opportunity to raise constitutional claims\nbefore impartial judges, see, e.g., Lewis v. Casey, 518 U. S.\n343, 351 (1996). Moreover, because access to the courts is a\nfundamental right, see id., at 346, government-drawn\nclassifications that impose substantial burdens on the\ncapacity of a group of citizens to exercise that right require\nsearching judicial examination under the Equal Protection\nClause, see, e.g., Lyng v. Automobile Workers, 485 U. S.\n360, 370 (1988).\n   The correct interpretation of the PLRA would obviate\nthe need for litigation over any of these issues. More\nimportant, the correct interpretation of the statute would\nrecognize that, in enacting the PLRA, Members of Con\ngress created a rational regime designed to reduce the\nquantity of frivolous prison litigation while adhering to\ntheir constitutional duty \u201cto respect the dignity of all\npersons,\u201d even \u201cthose convicted of heinous crimes.\u201d Roper\nv. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 560 (2005). Because today\u2019s\ndecision ignores that duty, I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
