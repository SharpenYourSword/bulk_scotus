GONZALES, ATTORNEY \n\n                  GENERAL\n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 04–1376. Argued March 22, 2006—Decided June 22, 2006\nImmigration law has for some time provided that an order for removing\n  an alien present unlawfully may be reinstated if he leaves and\n  unlawfully reenters. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\n  Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) amended the Immigration and\n  Nationality Act (INA) to enlarge the class of illegal reentrants whose\n  orders may be reinstated and limit the possible relief from a removal\n  order available to them. See §241(a)(5), 8 U. S. C. §1235(a)(5). Peti\n  tioner Fernandez-Vargas, a Mexican citizen, illegally reentered the\n  United States in 1982, after having been deported. He remained un\n  detected for over 20 years, fathering a son in 1989 and marrying the\n  boy’s mother, a United States citizen, in 2001. After he filed an ap\n  plication to adjust his status to that of a lawful permanent resident,\n  the Government began proceedings to reinstate his 1981 deportation\n  order under §241(a)(5), and deported him. He petitioned the Tenth\n  Circuit to review the reinstatement order, claiming that, because he\n  illegally reentered the county before IIRIRA’s effective date,\n  §241(a)(5) did not bar his application for adjustment of status, and\n  that §241(a)(5) would be impermissibly retroactive if it did bar his ad\n  justment application. The court held that §241(a)(5) barred his ap\n  plication and followed Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244,\n  in determining that the new law had no impermissibly retroactive ef\n  fect in his case.\nHeld: Section 241(a)(5) applies to those who reentered the United\n States before IIRIRA’s effective date and does not retroactively affect\n any right of, or impose any burden on, the continuing violator of the\n INA now before this Court. Pp. 5–16.\n    (a) Statutes are disfavored as retroactive when their application\n2                 FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v. GONZALES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    “would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a\n    party’s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to\n    transactions already completed.” Landgraf, supra, at 280. A statute\n    is not given retroactive effect “unless such construction is required by\n    explicit language or by necessary implication.” United States v. St.\n    Louis, S. F. & T. R. Co., 270 U. S. 1, 3. In determining whether a\n    statute has an impermissibly retroactive effect, the Court first looks\n    to “whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper\n    reach,” Landgraf, supra, at 280, and in the absence of express lan\n    guage tries to draw a comparably firm conclusion about the temporal\n    reach specifically intended by applying its “normal rules of construc\n    tion,” Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 326. If that effort fails, the\n    Court asks whether applying the statute to the person objecting\n    would have a retroactive effect in the disfavored sense of “affecting\n    substantive rights, liabilities, or duties [on the basis of] conduct aris\n    ing before [its] enactment,” Landgraf, supra, at 278. If the answer is\n    yes, the Court then applies the presumption against retroactivity by\n    construing the statute as inapplicable to the event or act in question.\n    INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 316. Pp. 5–7.\n       (b) Common principles of statutory interpretation fail to unsettle\n    §241(a)(5)’s apparent application to any reentrant present in the\n    country, whatever the date of return. The statute does not expressly\n    include in or exclude from §241(a)(5)’s ambit individuals who illegally\n    entered the country before IIRIRA’s effective date. Fernandez-\n    Vargas argues that the fact that the old reinstatement provision ap\n    plied to aliens who had “unlawfully reentered . . . after having previ\n    ously departed or been deported . . . , whether before or after June 27,\n    1952 [the INA’s effective date], on any ground described in . . . sub\n    section (e),” §242(f), while §241(a)(5) lacks language of temporal\n    reach, shows that Congress no longer meant to cover preenactment\n    reentrants. But the old before-or-after clause, which was sandwiched\n    between references to departure or deportation and grounds for de\n    portation, most naturally referred not to an alien’s illegal reentry but\n    to the previous deportation or departure. The better inference is that\n    the clause was removed because, in 1996, application keyed to depar\n    tures in 1952 or earlier was academic. Applying §241(a)(5) only to\n    deportations or departures after IIRIRA’s effective date would ex\n    empt anyone who departed before that date but reentered after it.\n    That would be a strange result, since the statute was revised to ex\n    pand the scope of the reinstatement authority and invest it with\n    something closer to finality. Fernandez-Vargas errs in suggesting\n    that the new law is bereft of clarity and the Court should apply the\n    presumption against retroactivity as a tool for interpreting the stat\n    ute at the first Landgraf step. It is not until a statute is shown to\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  have no firm provision about temporal reach but to produce a retroac\n  tive effect when straightforwardly applied that the presumption has\n  its work to do. And IIRIRA has other provisions on temporal reach,\n  which blunt Fernandez-Vargas’s argument that a negative inference\n  in his favor may be drawn from removal of the before-or-after clause.\n  Pp. 7–10.\n     (c) This facial reading is confirmed by two features of IIRIRA.\n  First, the provision’s text shows that it applies here not because Fer\n  nandez-Vargas reentered at any particular time, but because he\n  chose to remain after the new statute became effective. While the\n  law looks back to “an alien [who] has reentered . . . illegally,” 8\n  U. S. C. §1231(a)(5), the provision does not penalize an alien for the\n  reentry; it establishes a process to remove him under a “prior order\n  any time after the reentry,” ibid. Thus, it is the conduct of remaining\n  in the country after entry that is the predicate action; the law applies\n  to stop an indefinitely continuing violation that the alien could end at\n  any time by voluntarily leaving. It is therefore the alien’s choice to\n  continue his illegal presence, after illegal reentry and after the new\n  law’s effective date, that subjects him to the new and less generous\n  regime, not a past act that is he helpless to undo. INS v. St. Cyr, su\n  pra, distinguished. Second, IIRIRA’s effective date provision shows\n  that Fernandez-Vargas had ample warning of the coming change in\n  the law, but chose to remain until the old regime expired and\n  §241(a)(5) took its place. He had an opportunity to avoid the new\n  law’s application by leaving the country and ending his violation dur\n  ing the 6 months between IIRIRA’s enactment and effective date.\n  For that matter, he could have married his son’s mother and applied\n  for adjustment of status during the period, in which case he would at\n  least have had a claim that proven reliance on the law should be hon\n  ored by applying the presumption against retroactivity. Instead, he\n  augmented his 15 years of unlawful presence by remaining in the\n  country into the future subject to the new law. And the presumption\n  against retroactivity does not amount to a presumption of legal stasis\n  for the benefit of continuous lawbreakers.

The Illegal Immi\ngration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996\n(IIRIRA), Pub. L. 104–208, div. C, 110 Stat. 3009–546,\nenlarged the class of illegal reentrants whose orders may\nbe reinstated and limited the possible relief from a re\nmoval order available to them. See Immigration and\nNationality Act (INA), §241(a)(5), 66 Stat. 204, as added\nby IIRIRA §305(a)(3), 110 Stat. 3009–599, 8 U. S. C.\n§1231(a)(5). The questions here are whether the new\nversion of the reinstatement provision is correctly read to\napply to individuals who reentered the United States\nbefore IIRIRA’s effective date, and whether such a reading\nmay be rejected as impermissibly retroactive. We hold the\nstatute applies to those who entered before IIRIRA and\ndoes not retroactively affect any right of, or impose any\nburden on, the continuing violator of the INA now before\nus.\n2                FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v. GONZALES\n\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n\n                              I\n\n   In 1950, Congress provided that deportation orders\nissued against some aliens who later reentered the United\nStates illegally could be reinstated.1 Internal Security Act\nof 1950, §23(d), 64 Stat. 1012, 8 U. S. C. §156(d) (1946 ed.,\nSupp. V).2 Only specific illegal reentrants were subject to\nthe provision, those deported as “anarchists” or “subver\nsives,” for example, see §23(c), 64 Stat. 1012, while the\nrest got the benefit of the ordinary deportation rules.\nCongress retained a reinstatement provision two years\nlater when it revised the immigration laws through the\nINA, §242(f), 66 Stat. 212, as codified in this subsection:\n     “Should the Attorney General find that any alien has\n     unlawfully reentered the United States after having\n     previously departed or been deported pursuant to an\n     order of deportation, whether before or after June 27,\n     1952,3 on any ground described in subsection (e) . . . ,\n     the previous order of deportation shall be deemed to\n     be reinstated from its original date and such alien\n     shall be deported under such previous order at any\n     time subsequent to such reentry.” 8 U. S. C. §1252(f)\n     (1994 ed.).\n——————\n   1 What was formerly known as “deportation” is now called “removal”\n\nin IIRIRA. See Neuman, Habeas Corpus, Executive Detention, and the\nRemoval of Aliens, 98 Colum. L. Rev. 961, 966 (1998) (IIRIRA “re\naligned the vocabulary of immigration law, creating a new category of\n‘removal’ proceedings that largely replaces what were formerly exclu\nsion proceedings and deportation proceedings”). Our use of each term\nhere will vary according to the scheme under discussion.\n   2 This is the full text of the provision: “Should any alien subject to the\n\nprovisions of subsection (c) unlawfully return to the United States after\nhaving been released for departure or deported pursuant to this section,\nthe previous warrant of deportation against him shall be considered as\nreinstated from its original date of issuance.”\n   3 A date was inserted when the provision was codified; as originally\n\nenacted, the text read, “whether before or after the date of enactment of\nthis Act.” 66 Stat. 212.\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nAgain, only a limited class of illegal reentrants was sus\nceptible, see §242(e), 66 Stat. 211; cf. §241(a), id., at 204,\nand even those affected could seek some varieties of dis\ncretionary relief, see, e.g., 8 U. S. C. §1254(a)(1) (1994 ed.)\n(suspension of deportation available to aliens who main\ntained a continuous presence in the United States for\nseven years and could demonstrate extreme hardship and\na good moral character).\n  In IIRIRA, Congress replaced this reinstatement provi\nsion with one that toed a harder line, as the old §242(f)\nwas displaced by the new §241(a)(5):\n     “If the Attorney General finds that an alien has reen\n     tered the United States illegally after having been\n     removed or having departed voluntarily, under an or\n     der of removal, the prior order of removal is reinstated\n     from its original date and is not subject to being re\n     opened or reviewed, the alien is not eligible and may\n     not apply for any relief under this chapter, and the\n     alien shall be removed under the prior order at any\n     time after the reentry.” 8 U. S. C. §1231(a)(5) (1994\n     ed., Supp. III).\nThe new law became effective on April 1, 1997, “the first\nday of the first month beginning more than 180 days after”\nIIRIRA’s enactment. §309(a), 110 Stat. 3009–625. Unlike\nits predecessor, §241(a)(5) applies to all illegal reentrants,\nexplicitly insulates the removal orders from review, and\ngenerally forecloses discretionary relief from the terms of\nthe reinstated order.4\n——————\n  4 Notwithstanding the absolute terms in which the bar on relief is\n\nstated, even an alien subject to §241(a)(5) may seek withholding of\nremoval under 8 U. S. C. §1231(b)(3)(A) (2000 ed.) (alien may not be\nremoved to country if “the alien’s life or freedom would be threatened in\nthat country because of the alien’s race, religion, nationality, member\nship in a particular social group, or political opinion”), or under 8 CFR\n§§241.8(e) and 208.31 (2006) (raising the possibility of asylum to aliens\n4              FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v.

In 2001, Fernandez-Vargas married the boy’s\nmother, who is also a United States citizen. She soon filed\na relative-visa petition on behalf of her husband, see 8\nU. S. C. §§1154(a), 1151(b) (2000 ed.); see Fernandez-\nVargas v. Ashcroft, 394 F. 3d 881, 883, n. 4 (CA10 2005), on\nthe basis of which he filed an application to adjust his\nstatus to that of lawful permanent resident, see §1255(i).\nThe filings apparently tipped off the authorities to his\nillegal presence here, and in November 2003, the Govern\nment began proceedings under §241(a)(5) that eventuated\nin reinstating Fernandez-Vargas’s 1981 deportation order,\nbut without the possibility of adjusting his status to lawful\nresidence. He was detained for 10 months before being\nremoved to Juarez, Mexico in September 2004.\n   Fernandez-Vargas petitioned the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Tenth Circuit to review the reinstatement\norder. He took the position that because he illegally reen\ntered the country before IIRIRA’s effective date, the con\ntrolling reinstatement provision was the old §242(f), which\nmeant he was eligible to apply for adjustment of status as\nspouse of a citizen, and he said that the new §241(a)(5)\nwould be impermissibly retroactive if it barred his applica\ntion for adjustment. The Court of Appeals held that\n§241(a)(5) did bar Fernandez-Vargas’s application and\nfollowed Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244\n(1994), in determining that the new law had no impermissi\n——————\nwhose removal order has been reinstated under INA §241(a)(5)).\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

The modern law\nthus follows Justice Story’s definition of a retroactive\nstatute, as “tak[ing] away or impair[ing] vested rights\nacquired under existing laws, or creat[ing] a new obliga\ntion, impos[ing] a new duty, or attach[ing] a new disabil\nity, in respect to transactions or considerations already\npast,” Society for the Propagation of the Gospel v.

The Courts of Appeals\nin the majority are themselves divided on the question whether an\nalien’s marriage or application for adjustment of status before the\nstatute’s effective date (facts not in play here) renders the statute\nimpermissibly retroactive when it is applied to the alien. See, e.g.,\nFaiz-Mohammad, supra, at 809–810 (application for adjustment of\nstatus); Alvarez-Portillo, supra, at 862, 867 (marriage).\n6            FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v. GONZALES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute shall not be given retroactive effect unless such\nconstruction is required by explicit language or by neces\nsary implication.” United States v. St. Louis, S. F. & T. R.\nCo., 270 U. S. 1, 3 (1926) (opinion for the Court by\nBrandeis, J.).\n   This Court has worked out a sequence of analysis when\nan objection is made to applying a particular statute said\nto affect a vested right or to impose some burden on the\nbasis of an act or event preceding the statute’s enactment.\nWe first look to “whether Congress has expressly pre\nscribed the statute’s proper reach,” Landgraf, supra, at\n280, and in the absence of language as helpful as that we\ntry to draw a comparably firm conclusion about the tem\nporal reach specifically intended by applying “our normal\nrules of construction,” Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 326\n(1997). If that effort fails, we ask whether applying the\nstatute to the person objecting would have a retroactive\nconsequence in the disfavored sense of “affecting substan\ntive rights, liabilities, or duties [on the basis of] conduct\narising before [its] enactment,” Landgraf, supra, at 278;\nsee also Lindh, supra, at 326. If the answer is yes, we\nthen apply the presumption against retroactivity by con\nstruing the statute as inapplicable to the event or act in\nquestion owing to the “absen[ce of] a clear indication from\nCongress that it intended such a result.” INS v. St. Cyr,\n533 U. S. 289, 316 (2001); see Martin v. Hadix, 527 U. S.\n343, 352 (1999) (quoting Landgraf, supra, at 280).\n   Fernandez-Vargas fights at each step of the way, argu\ning that Congress intended that INA §241(a)(5) would not\napply to illegal reentrants like him who returned to this\ncountry before the provision’s effective date; and in any\nevent, that application of the provision to such illegal\nreentrants would have an impermissibly retroactive effect,\nto be avoided by applying the presumption against it.

Section 242(f)\napplied to “any alien [who] has unlawfully reentered the\nUnited States after having previously departed or been\ndeported pursuant to an order of deportation, whether\nbefore or after June 27, 1952, on any ground described in\n. . . subsection (e).” 8 U. S. C. §1252(f) (1994 ed.). Accord\ning to Fernandez-Vargas, since that before-or-after clause\nmade it clear that the statute applied to aliens who reen\ntered before the enactment date of the earlier version, its\nelimination in the current iteration shows that Congress\nno longer meant to cover preenactment reentrants. See\nBrewster v. Gage, 280 U. S. 327, 337 (1930) (“deliberate\nselection of language . . . differing from that used in the\nearlier Acts” can indicate “that a change of law was in\n——————\n  6 The  Government urges us to forgo Landgraf analysis altogether\nbecause §241(a)(5) regulates only a present removal process, not past\nprimary conduct, citing our recent decision in Republic of Austria v.\nAltmann, 541 U. S. 677 (2004). Although we ultimately agree with the\nGovernment, in the abstract at least, that the reinstatement provision\nconcerns itself with postenactment affairs, see infra, at 13–15, we find\nthe Government’s allusion to Altmann inapt. The Court’s conclusion in\nthat case, that Landgraf was to be avoided, turned on the peculiarities\nof the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. See Altmann, supra, at 694–\n696. Those peculiarities are absent here, and we thus advert to Land\ngraf, as we ordinarily do.\n8              FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v. GONZALES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntended”); cf. 2B N. Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construc\ntion §51.04, p. 244 (6th rev. ed. 2000). But the clues are not\nthat simple.\n   To begin with, the old before-or-after clause was sand\nwiched between references to departure or deportation\nunder a deportation order and to grounds for deportation\nset out in a different subsection of the INA. It thus most\nnaturally referred not to the illegal reentry but to the\nalien’s previous deportation or departure. If its omission\nfrom the new subsection (a)(5) is significant, its immediate\nsignificance goes to the date of leaving this country, not\nthe date of illegal return. Since the old clause referred to\nthe date of enactment of the INA in 1952, the negative\nimplication argument from dropping the language is that\nthe reinstatement section no longer applies to those who\nleft the country before that date. But, in 1996, application\nkeyed to departures in 1952 or earlier was academic, and\nthe better inference is that the clause was removed for\nthat reason.7\n   If, moreover, we indulged any suggestion that omitting\nthe clause showed an intent to apply §241(a)(5) only to\ndeportations or departures after IIRIRA’s effective date,\nthe result would be a very strange one: it would exempt\nfrom the new reinstatement provision’s coverage anyone\nwho departed before IIRIRA’s effective date but reentered\nafter it. The point of the statute’s revision, however, was\nobviously to expand the scope of the reinstatement author\nity and invest it with something closer to finality, and it\nwould make no sense to infer that Congress meant to\nexcept the broad class of persons who had departed before\nthe time of enactment but who might return illegally at\nsome point in the future.\n——————\n  7 We therefore need not entertain Fernandez-Vargas’s argument that\n\nthe provision’s drafting history indicates that the language was elimi\nnated deliberately.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Fernandez-Vargas sidesteps this problem (on a very\ngenerous reading of his argument) by making a more\ngeneral suggestion of congressional intent: whatever the\nevent to which the old law was tied, activity before as well\nas activity after it implicated the reinstatement power.\nSince the new law is bereft of such clarity, we should\napply the “ ‘longstanding principle of construing any lin\ngering ambiguities in deportation statutes in favor of the\nalien,’ ” St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 320 (quoting INS v. Car\ndoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421, 449 (1987)), which would\neffectively impose “[t]he presumption against retroactive\napplication of ambiguous statutory provisions,” St. Cyr,\nsupra, at 320. If we did so, we would find that §241(a)(5)\noperates only to reentries after its effective date.\n   Even at this amorphously general level, however, the\nargument suffers from two flaws, the first being that it\nputs the cart before the horse. As Fernandez-Vargas\nrealizes, he urges application of the presumption against\nretroactivity as a tool for interpreting the statute at the\nfirst Landgraf step. But if that were legitimate, a statute\nlacking an express provision about temporal reach would\nnever be construed as having a retroactive potential and\nthe final two steps in the Landgraf enquiry would never\noccur (that is, asking whether the statute would produce a\nretroactive effect, and barring any such application by\napplying the presumption against retroactivity). It is not\nuntil a statute is shown to have no firm provision about\ntemporal reach but to produce a retroactive effect when\nstraightforwardly applied that the presumption has its\nwork to do. See 511 U. S., at 280.\n   The second flaw is the argument’s failure to account for\nthe new statute’s other provisions on temporal reach, from\nwhich one might draw a negative inference that subsec\ntion (a)(5) was (or at least may well have been) meant to\napply to reentries before its effective date. In contrast to\ntheir silence about the temporal sweep of §241(a)(5), the\n10             FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v. GONZALES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n1996 amendments speak directly to the scope of changes\nin provisions making reentry criminal and setting civil\npenalties. IIRIRA §324(c), 110 Stat. 3009–629, note fol\nlowing 8 U. S. C. §1326 (2000 ed.), provides that the ex\npanded criminal prohibitions, see §1326(a), apply only to\nreentries or attempts after the effective date, and §105(b),\n110 Stat. 3009–556, note following 8 U. S. C. §1325, pro\nvides the same as to civil penalties for illegal reentry, see\n§1325(b). The point here is not that these provisions alone\nwould support an inference of intent to apply the rein\nstatement provision retroactively, see Lindh, 521 U. S., at\n328, n. 4, for we require a clear statement for that, see\nMartin, 527 U. S., at 354. But these provisions do blunt\nany argument that removal of the before-or-after clause\nsuffices to establish the applicability of §241(a)(5) only to\nposteffective date reentries. The fact is that IIRIRA some\ntimes expressly made changes prospective as from its\neffective date and sometimes expressly provided they were\napplicable to earlier acts; compare §§324(c) and 105(b),\nwith §347(c), 110 Stat. 3009–639 (provision governing\nremoval of aliens who have unlawfully voted is applicable\n“to voting occurring before, on, or after the date of the\nenactment of this Act”), and §351(c), id., at 3009–640\n(provision applicable to “waivers filed before, on, or after\nthe date of the enactment of this Act”). With such a vari\nety of treatment, it is just too hard to infer any clear inten\ntion at any level of generality from the fact of retiring the\nold before-or-after language from what is now §241(a)(5).\n   One conclusion can be stated, however. Common prin\nciples of statutory interpretation fail to unsettle the ap\nparent application of §241(a)(5) to any reentrant present\nin the country, whatever the date of return.8\n——————\n  8 JUSTICE STEVENS states that when, in 1952, Congress inserted the\n\nbefore-or-after clause with the old §242(f), it was responding to the\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (INS) practice of applying the\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006) \n                  11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\n                              B\n\n  This facial reading is confirmed by two features of\nIIRIRA, not previously discussed, that describe the con\nduct to which §241(a)(5) applies, and show that the appli\ncation suffers from no retroactivity in denying Fernandez-\nVargas the opportunity for adjustment of status as the\nspouse of a citizen of the United States.9 One is in the text\nof that provision itself, showing that it applies to Fernan\ndez-Vargas today not because he reentered in 1982 or at\nany other particular time, but because he chose to remain\nafter the new statute became effective. The second is the\nprovision setting IIRIRA’s effective date, §309(a), 110 Stat.\n3009–625, which shows that Fernandez-Vargas had an\nample warning of the coming change in the law, but chose\n——————\nreinstatement provision only to deportation orders issued after the\nprovision’s enactment, a practice that necessarily meant INS applied\nthe provision only to postenactment reentries. By correcting the INS’s\ninterpretation only as to deportation orders, JUSTICE STEVENS suggests,\nCongress did nothing to disturb the practice as to reentries. And when\nit removed the obsolete before-or-after clause in 1996 without adding\nalternative language of temporal reach, the argument goes, Congress\nheld fast to its intent in 1950 and 1952 to apply the reinstatement\nprovision only to postenactment reentries. But the INS’s practice circa\n1951 of applying the reinstatement provision only to postenactment\nreentries followed from its policy regarding deportation orders, and in\n1952 Congress might just as easily have assumed that the branch\nwould go the way of the root. In any event, it is difficult to accept\nJUSTICE STEVENS’s view that congressional understanding from 40\nyears back was intended to govern the IIRIRA reinstatement provision,\ngiven Congress’s care to make the revised criminal and civil penalties\napplicable only to postenactment reentries.\n   9 We would reach the same conclusion about denial of opportunities to\n\napply for permission for voluntary departure as an alternative to\nremoval, see 8 U. S. C. §1229c, and about cancellation of removal, see\n§1229b(b), if there were a need to deal with these matters separately.\nAlthough Fernandez-Vargas argues that he is being denied the chance\nto seek these forms of relief, he never applied for either of them and has\nnot formally attempted to claim them in response to the reinstatement\nand removal proceedings.\n12            FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v. GONZALES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto remain until the old regime expired and §241(a)(5) took\nits place.\n   As a preface to identifying the conduct by Fernandez-\nVargas to which the reinstatement provision applies (the\nconduct that results in reinstating the old deportation\norder without the former opportunities to seek adjustment\nof status), a look at our holding in St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, is\nhelpful. The alien, St. Cyr, was a lawful, permanent\nresident who made a plea agreement and pleaded guilty to\nan aggravated felony charge. Although the resulting\nconviction justified his deportation, when he entered his\nplea the law allowed him to seek a waiver of deportation\nat the discretion of the Attorney General. Between the\nplea and deportation proceedings, however, IIRIRA and\nanother statute repealed the provision for that discretion\nary relief, converting deportation from a possibility to a\ncertainty. Id., at 325. The question was whether Land\ngraf barred application of the new law eliminating discre\ntionary relief, on the ground that applying it to a defen\ndant who pleaded guilty before the enactment of the new\nlaw would attach a further burdensome consequence to his\nplea, amounting to “a new disability, in respect to transac\ntions or considerations already past,” 533 U. S., at 321\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The answer was that\nconverting deportation from a likely possibility to a dead\ncertainty would add such a burden, and application of the\nnew law was accordingly barred. Id., at 325. In making\nthis “commonsense, functional judgment,” Martin, supra,\nat 357, we emphasized that plea agreements “involve a\nquid pro quo between a criminal defendant and the gov\nernment,” St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 321, in which a waiver of\n“constitutional rights (including the right to a trial),” had\nbeen exchanged for a “perceived benefit,” id., at 322, which\nin practical terms was valued in light of the possible dis\ncretionary relief, a focus of expectation and reliance, id., at\n323.\n                      Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                       13\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   St. Cyr’s agreement for a quid pro quo and his plea were\nentirely past, and there was no question of undoing them,\nbut the “transactio[n] or consideratio[n]” on which\n§241(a)(5) turns is different.10 While the law looks back to\na past act in its application to “an alien [who] has reen\ntered . . . illegally,” 8 U. S. C. §1231(a)(5), the provision\ndoes not penalize an alien for the reentry (criminal and\ncivil penalties do that); it establishes a process to remove\nhim “under the prior order at any time after the reentry.”\nIbid. Thus, it is the conduct of remaining in the country\nafter entry that is the predicate action; the statute applies\nto stop an indefinitely continuing violation that the alien\nhimself could end at any time by voluntarily leaving the\ncountry. It is therefore the alien’s choice to continue his\nillegal presence, after illegal reentry and after the effective\ndate of the new law, that subjects him to the new and less\ngenerous legal regime, not a past act that he is helpless to\nundo up to the moment the Government finds him out.\n   That in itself is enough to explain that Fernandez-\nVargas has no retroactivity claim based on a new disabil\n——————\n  10 We  understand Fernandez-Vargas’s claim as falling within the\nsecond of Justice Story’s categories of retroactivity (new consequences\nof past acts), not the first category of canceling vested rights. The\nforms of relief identified by Fernandez-Vargas as rendered unavailable\nto him by §241(a)(5) include cancellation of removal, see 8 U. S. C.\n§1229b(b), adjustment of status, see §1255, and voluntary departure,\nsee §1229c. These putative claims to relief are not “vested rights,” a\nterm that describes something more substantial than inchoate expecta\ntions and unrealized opportunities. In contrast to “an immediate fixed\nright of present or future enjoyment,” Pearsall v. Great Northern R. Co.,\n161 U. S. 646, 673 (1896) (internal quotation marks omitted), Fernandez-\nVargas’s claim to such relief was contingent, and it was up to him to take\nsome action that would elevate it above the level of hope. It is not that\nthese forms of relief are discretionary, cf. St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 325; it is\nrather that before IIRIRA’s effective date Fernandez-Vargas never availed\nhimself of them or took action that enhanced their significance to him in\nparticular, as St. Cyr did in making his quid pro quo agreement, see\nsupra, at 11–12.\n14              FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v. GONZALES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nity consequent to a completed act, but in fact his position\nis weaker still. For Fernandez-Vargas could not only have\nchosen to end his continuing violation and his exposure to\nthe less favorable law, he even had an ample warning that\nthe new law could be applied to him and ample opportu\nnity to avoid that very possibility by leaving the country\nand ending his violation in the period between enactment\nof §241(a)(5) and its effective date. IRRIRA became law on\nSeptember 30, 1996, but it became effective and enforce\nable only on “the first day of the first month beginning\nmore than 180 days after” IIRIRA’s enactment, that is,\nApril 1, 1997. §309(a), 110 Stat. 3009–625. Unlawful\nalien reentrants like Fernandez-Vargas thus had the\nadvantage of a grace period between the unequivocal\nwarning that a tougher removal regime lay ahead and\nactual imposition of the less opportune terms of the new\nlaw. In that stretch of six months, Fernandez-Vargas\ncould have ended his illegal presence and potential expo\nsure to the coming law by crossing back into Mexico.11 For\n——————\n  11 In a series of letters submitted to the Court after oral argument,\n\nthe parties dispute the consequences if Fernandez-Vargas had left\nvoluntarily after IIRIRA’s enactment and, specifically, the period of\ninadmissibility to which Fernandez-Vargas would thereupon have been\nsubject. Because we conclude that §241(a)(5) does not operate on a\ncompleted pre-enactment act, we need not consider the retroactive\nimplications either of the fact of his inadmissibility or of any variance\nbetween the period of inadmissibility upon a postenactment voluntary\nreturn and that prescribed under the old regime. The period of inad\nmissibility stems from an alien’s illegal reentry within a specified time\nafter a prior removal and is applicable to Fernandez-Vargas because he\nreentered shortly after his 1981 deportation, but Fernandez-Vargas\ndoes not challenge as impermissibly retroactive IIRIRA’s lengthening of\nthat period from 5 to 10 or 20 years, see 8 U. S. C. §1182(a)(6)(B) (1994\ned.); §1182(a)(9)(A)(ii) (2000 ed.).\n  In any event, any period of inadmissibility is subject to waiver by the\nAttorney General, see §1182(a)(6)(B) (1994 ed.); §1182(a)(9)(A)(iii)\n(2000 ed.), and presumably Fernandez-Vargas could plead his serious\ncase for such a waiver (his marriage, his child) in seeking legal reentry\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat matter, he could have married the mother of his son\nand applied for adjustment of status during that period, in\nwhich case he would at least have had a claim (about\nwhich we express no opinion) that proven reliance on the\nold law should be honored by applying the presumption\nagainst retroactivity.12\n   Fernandez-Vargas did not, however, take advantage of\nthe statutory warning, but augmented his past 15 years of\nunlawful presence by remaining in the country into the\nfuture subject to the new law, whose applicability thus\nturned not on the completed act of reentry, but on a failure\nto take timely action that would have avoided application\nof the new law altogether. To be sure, a choice to avoid\nthe new law before its effective date or to end the continu\ning violation thereafter would have come at a high per\nsonal price, for Fernandez-Vargas would have had to leave\na business and a family he had established during his\nillegal residence. But the branch of retroactivity law that\nconcerns us here is meant to avoid new burdens imposed\non completed acts, not all difficult choices occasioned by\nnew law. What Fernandez-Vargas complains of is the\napplication of new law to continuously illegal action within\nhis control both before and after the new law took effect. He\nclaims a right to continue illegal conduct indefinitely under\nthe terms on which it began, an entitlement of legal stasis\nfor those whose lawbreaking is continuous. But “[i]f every\ntime a man relied on existing law in arranging his affairs,\nhe were made secure against any change in legal rules, the\nwhole body of our law would be ossified forever.” L. Fuller,\nThe Morality of Law 60 (1964) (quoted in Landgraf, 511\nU. S., at 269, n. 24).13\n——————\nto the United States.\n   12 See 394 F. 3d, at 890, and n. 11 (distinguishing Fernandez-Vargas’s\n\ncircumstance from that of aliens who had married, or both married and\napplied for adjustment of status, before IIRIRA’s effective date).\n   13 This is the nub of our disagreement with JUSTICE STEVENS. He says\n16              FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v. GONZALES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  Because we conclude that §241(a)(5) has no retroactive\neffect when applied to aliens like Fernandez-Vargas, we\naffirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n                                                     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\nit misses the point to say that Fernandez-Vargas could avoid the new\nlaw by returning to Mexico, which he thinks is like saying that a\ndefendant could avoid a retroactive criminal penalty by locking himself\nup for 10 years, post, at 5, n. 2. JUSTICE STEVENS thus argues that\nreimposing an order of removal to end illegal residence is like imposing\na penalty for a completed act (the defendant’s unspecified act in his\nanalogy). But even on his own analysis, Fernandez-Vargas continued\nto violate the law by remaining in this country day after day, and\nJUSTICE STEVENS does not deny that the United States was entitled to\nbring that continuing violation to an end. He says, however, that\nCongress should not be understood to provide that if the violation\ncontinues into the future it may be ended on terms less favorable than\nthose at the beginning. But this is not the position that retroactivity\ndoctrine imputes to an inexplicit Congress. Fernandez-Vargas may\nhave an equitable argument that the Government should not, for the\nfuture, eliminate an opportunity for continuing illegality accompanied\nby the hopes that long illegal residence and a prospect of marriage gave\nhim in the past. But Congress apparently did not accept such an\nargument, which could prevail here only if the presumption against\nretroactivity amounted to a presumption of legal stasis for the benefit\nof continuous lawbreakers.\n                    Cite as: 548 U.

Over the next 20 years, petitioner\nremained here. He worked as a truckdriver, owned a\ntrucking business, fathered a child, and eventually mar\nried the child’s mother, a United States citizen. The laws\nin place at the time of petitioner’s entry and for the first\n15 years of his residence in this country would have re\nwarded this behavior, allowing him to seek discretionary\nrelief from deportation on the basis of his continued pres\nence in and strong ties to the United States. See 8 U. S. C.\n§1254(a)(1) (1994 ed.).\n   In 1996, however, Congress passed a new version of the\napplicable provision eliminating almost entirely the possi\nbility of relief from deportation for aliens who reenter the\ncountry illegally having previously been deported. See\nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibil\nity Act (IIRIRA), §305(a)(3), 110 Stat. 3009–599, 8 U. S. C.\n§1231(a)(5) (2000 ed.); see also ante, at 3, n. 4. The 1996\nprovision is silent as to whether it was intended to apply\nretroactively to conduct that predated its enactment.1\n——————\n  1 The statutory provisions expanding the class of people to whom\n\ncriminal penalties for illegal reentry might apply, however, explicitly\n2               FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v. GONZALES\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nDespite a historical practice supporting petitioner’s read\ning, and despite the harsh consequences that attend its\napplication to thousands of individuals who, like peti\ntioner, entered the country illegally before 1997, the Court\nnot only holds that the statute applies to preenactment\nreentries but also that it has no retroactive effect. I dis\nagree with both of these conclusions.\n                              I\n  In 1950, when Congress first gave the Attorney General\nthe authority to reinstate an order of deportation, it en\nacted a reinstatement provision containing no explicit\ntemporal reach.2 See Internal Security Act, §23(d), 64\nStat. 1012, 8 U. S. C. §156(d) (1946 ed., Supp. V). The\nnatural reading of this provision, the one most consistent\nwith the “deeply rooted” traditional presumption against\nretroactivity, Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S.\n244, 265 (1994), is that it would apply to deportations that\noccurred before the provision’s enactment but not to\npreenactment reentries.       While both deportation and\nreentry can constitute “events completed before [the provi\nsion’s] enactment,” id., at 270, an alien’s reentry is the act\nthat triggers the provision’s operation and is therefore the\nact to which the provision attaches legal consequences.\n  When the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)\npromulgated regulations implementing the 1950 statute,\nhowever, it did not read the statute so naturally.

C. §1326.\n  2 The provision stated:\n\n“Should any alien subject to the provisions of subsection (c) unlawfully\nreturn to the United States after having been released for departure or\ndeported pursuant to this section, the previous war-rant of deportation\nagainst him shall be considered as reinstated from its original date of\nissuance.” 64 Stat. 1012, codified as 8 U.

See 8\nCFR §152.5 (1950 Cum. Supp.). Thus, the INS read the\nreinstatement provision as inapplicable even to reentries\nthat occurred after the statute’s enactment date if the\nunderlying deportation had been entered before that date;\nit follows a fortiori that the provision was considered\ninapplicable to reentries that occurred before the statute’s\nenactment.\n   Congress corrected the INS’ error two years later by\nadding the clause “whether before or after the date of\nenactment of this Act.” Immigration and Nationality Act,\n§242(f), 66 Stat. 212, 8 U. S. C. §1252(f) (1994 ed.); see also\nante, at 2, and nn. 2–3. As the Court correctly notes, that\namendment “most naturally referred not to the illegal\nreentry but to the alien’s previous deportation or depar\nture.” Ante, at 8. The best interpretation of Congress’\nintent with regard to the 1952 statute, then, was that it\nmeant to apply the reinstatement provision to preenact\nment deportations but to preserve the status quo with\nregard to preenactment reentries: In accordance with the\ntraditional presumption against retroactivity, preenact\nment reentries would remain uncovered by the reinstate\nment provision.\n   In 1996, when Congress enacted the current reinstate\nment provision, it drafted a version of the statute that,\nlike its 1950 predecessor, was silent as to its temporal\nreach. See 8 U. S. C. §1231(a)(5) (2000 ed.). If we assume\n(as the Court does) that the addition of the “before-or\nafter” clause in the 1952 statute merely clarified Congress’\noriginal intent in 1950 to make the provision applicable to\npreenactment departures without authorizing any appli\ncation to preenactment reentries, it is reasonable to at\ntribute precisely the same intent to the Congress that\nenacted the 1996 statute: As in the 1950 and 1952 ver\n4               FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v. GONZALES\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nsions of the provision, Congress intended the 1996 rein\nstatement provision to apply to preenactment deportations\nbut not to preenactment reentries.\n  In sum, our normal rules of construction support the\nreasonable presumption that Congress intended the provi\nsion to cover only postenactment reentries. Accordingly,\nthe 1996 reinstatement provision should not be construed\nto apply to petitioner’s earlier entry into the United\nStates.\n                              II\n   The Court not only fails to give the 1996 Act its most\nnormal interpretation, but also erroneously concludes that\nthe provision does not have any retroactive effect. The\nCourt reaches this conclusion based on its judgment that\nthe provision applies not to conduct that occurred before\nthe statute’s enactment date, but rather to “an indefinitely\ncontinuing violation that the alien himself could end at\nany time by voluntarily leaving the country.” Ante, at 13.\nThis reasoning is unpersuasive.\n   It is true, of course, that the order of deportation en\ntered against petitioner in 1981 could not be reinstated\nunless he was present in the United States, and that, until\nhe was arrested in 2003, petitioner could have chosen to\nleave the United States. But it is precisely petitioner’s\n“continuing violation” that allowed him to be eligible for\nrelief from deportation in the first place: He was required\nto have been physically present in the United States for a\nperiod of not less than seven years, to have been a person\nof good moral character during that time, and to have\ndeveloped ties to the United States such that his deporta\ntion would result in extreme hardship to himself or to his\nUnited States citizen wife or child.3 See 8 U. S. C.\n——————\n  3 Although petitioner became eligible for relief from deportation after\n\nbeing physically present in the United States for seven years, he could\nnot apply for that relief until the Government placed him in deporta\n                    Cite as: 548 U.

S. 183 (1984) (strictly construing physical presence\nrequirement). Moreover, under the pre-1996 version of\nthe reinstatement provision, the longer petitioner re\nmained in the United States the more likely he was to be\ngranted relief from deportation. See Matter of Ige, 20 I.\n& N. Dec. 880, 882 (1994) (listing factors considered in\nevaluating extreme hardship requirement, including\nalien’s length of residence in United States, family in\nUnited States, business or occupation, and position in\ncommunity).\n  Given these incentives, petitioner legitimately com\nplains that the Government has changed the rules\nmidgame. At the time of his entry, and for the next 15\nyears, it inured to petitioner’s benefit for him to remain in\nthe United States continuously, to build a business, and to\nstart a family. After April 1, 1997, the date on which the\napplicable reinstatement provision became effective, all of\nthese activities were rendered irrelevant in the eyes of the\nlaw. Only the Court’s unfortunately formalistic search for\na single “past act that [petitioner] is helpless to undo,”\nante, at 13, allows it to conclude that the provision at issue\nhas no retroactive effect.4 For regardless of whether his\n——————\ntion proceedings, at which point he could raise his eligibility as an\naffirmative defense. Cf. Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel.\nSchumer, 520 U. S. 939, 951–952 (1997) (applying presumption against\nretroactivity to statute eliminating affirmative defense).\n   4 Even on its own terms the Court’s logic is troubling. The Court\n\nbelieves that petitioner could have avoided being affected by the 1996\nreinstatement provision, not just retroactively but in any way whatso\never, by leaving the country prior to its effective date—a date that\noccurred six months after the statute’s enactment date not to give\naliens “ample warning,” ante, at 11, 13, but instead to allow the Attor\nney General to prepare for the substantial changes caused by the\nIIRIRA and to promulgate regulations to effectuate that Act. See §309,\n110 Stat. 3009–625. But had petitioner “take[n] advantage of the\nstatutory warning,” ante, at 15, he would have imposed upon himself\n6               FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v. GONZALES\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n1982 reentry was or was not an act that he could now\n“undo,” it is certainly an act to which the 1996 reinstate\nment provision has attached serious adverse conse\nquences. Because the provision has an undeniably harsh\nretroactive effect, “absent a clear indication from Congress\nthat it intended such a result,” INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S.\n289, 316 (2001), we should apply the presumption against\nretroactivity and hold that the 1996 reinstatement provi\nsion does not apply to petitioner.\n  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n——————\nthe very same punishment—the guarantee of removal to Mexico—that\nhe hopes to avoid. Just as we would not say that a defendant may\navoid the retroactive application of a criminal statute by locking him\nself up for 10 years, it cannot be that petitioner’s ability to leave the\ncountry of his own accord somehow helps to prove that the provision at\nissue has no retroactive effect.\n</pre>", "id": 145637, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2006/06/22/Fernandez-Vargas_v._Gonzales.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2005                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued March 22, 2006—Decided June 22, 2006\nImmigration law has for some time provided that an order for removing\n  an alien present unlawfully may be reinstated if he leaves and\n  unlawfully reenters. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\n  Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) amended the Immigration and\n  Nationality Act (INA) to enlarge the class of illegal reentrants whose\n  orders may be reinstated and limit the possible relief from a removal\n  order available to them. See §241(a)(5), 8 U. S. C. §1235(a)(5). Peti\n  tioner Fernandez-Vargas, a Mexican citizen, illegally reentered the\n  United States in 1982, after having been deported. He remained un\n  detected for over 20 years, fathering a son in 1989 and marrying the\n  boy’s mother, a United States citizen, in 2001. After he filed an ap\n  plication to adjust his status to that of a lawful permanent resident,\n  the Government began proceedings to reinstate his 1981 deportation\n  order under §241(a)(5), and deported him. He petitioned the Tenth\n  Circuit to review the reinstatement order, claiming that, because he\n  illegally reentered the county before IIRIRA’s effective date,\n  §241(a)(5) did not bar his application for adjustment of status, and\n  that §241(a)(5) would be impermissibly retroactive if it did bar his ad\n  justment application. The court held that §241(a)(5) barred his ap\n  plication and followed Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244,\n  in determining that the new law had no impermissibly retroactive ef\n  fect in his case.\nHeld: Section 241(a)(5) applies to those who reentered the United\n States before IIRIRA’s effective date and does not retroactively affect\n any right of, or impose any burden on, the continuing violator of the\n INA now before this Court. Pp. 5–16.\n    (a) Statutes are disfavored as retroactive when their application\n2                 FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v. GONZALES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    “would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a\n    party’s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to\n    transactions already completed.” Landgraf, supra, at 280. A statute\n    is not given retroactive effect “unless such construction is required by\n    explicit language or by necessary implication.” United States v. St.\n    Louis, S. F. & T. R. Co., 270 U. S. 1, 3. In determining whether a\n    statute has an impermissibly retroactive effect, the Court first looks\n    to “whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper\n    reach,” Landgraf, supra, at 280, and in the absence of express lan\n    guage tries to draw a comparably firm conclusion about the temporal\n    reach specifically intended by applying its “normal rules of construc\n    tion,” Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 326. If that effort fails, the\n    Court asks whether applying the statute to the person objecting\n    would have a retroactive effect in the disfavored sense of “affecting\n    substantive rights, liabilities, or duties [on the basis of] conduct aris\n    ing before [its] enactment,” Landgraf, supra, at 278. If the answer is\n    yes, the Court then applies the presumption against retroactivity by\n    construing the statute as inapplicable to the event or act in question.\n    INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 316. Pp. 5–7.\n       (b) Common principles of statutory interpretation fail to unsettle\n    §241(a)(5)’s apparent application to any reentrant present in the\n    country, whatever the date of return. The statute does not expressly\n    include in or exclude from §241(a)(5)’s ambit individuals who illegally\n    entered the country before IIRIRA’s effective date. Fernandez-\n    Vargas argues that the fact that the old reinstatement provision ap\n    plied to aliens who had “unlawfully reentered . . . after having previ\n    ously departed or been deported . . . , whether before or after June 27,\n    1952 [the INA’s effective date], on any ground described in . . . sub\n    section (e),” §242(f), while §241(a)(5) lacks language of temporal\n    reach, shows that Congress no longer meant to cover preenactment\n    reentrants. But the old before-or-after clause, which was sandwiched\n    between references to departure or deportation and grounds for de\n    portation, most naturally referred not to an alien’s illegal reentry but\n    to the previous deportation or departure. The better inference is that\n    the clause was removed because, in 1996, application keyed to depar\n    tures in 1952 or earlier was academic. Applying §241(a)(5) only to\n    deportations or departures after IIRIRA’s effective date would ex\n    empt anyone who departed before that date but reentered after it.\n    That would be a strange result, since the statute was revised to ex\n    pand the scope of the reinstatement authority and invest it with\n    something closer to finality. Fernandez-Vargas errs in suggesting\n    that the new law is bereft of clarity and the Court should apply the\n    presumption against retroactivity as a tool for interpreting the stat\n    ute at the first Landgraf step. It is not until a statute is shown to\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  have no firm provision about temporal reach but to produce a retroac\n  tive effect when straightforwardly applied that the presumption has\n  its work to do. And IIRIRA has other provisions on temporal reach,\n  which blunt Fernandez-Vargas’s argument that a negative inference\n  in his favor may be drawn from removal of the before-or-after clause.\n  Pp. 7–10.\n     (c) This facial reading is confirmed by two features of IIRIRA.\n  First, the provision’s text shows that it applies here not because Fer\n  nandez-Vargas reentered at any particular time, but because he\n  chose to remain after the new statute became effective. While the\n  law looks back to “an alien [who] has reentered . . . illegally,” 8\n  U. S. C. §1231(a)(5), the provision does not penalize an alien for the\n  reentry; it establishes a process to remove him under a “prior order\n  any time after the reentry,” ibid. Thus, it is the conduct of remaining\n  in the country after entry that is the predicate action; the law applies\n  to stop an indefinitely continuing violation that the alien could end at\n  any time by voluntarily leaving. It is therefore the alien’s choice to\n  continue his illegal presence, after illegal reentry and after the new\n  law’s effective date, that subjects him to the new and less generous\n  regime, not a past act that is he helpless to undo. INS v. St. Cyr, su\n  pra, distinguished. Second, IIRIRA’s effective date provision shows\n  that Fernandez-Vargas had ample warning of the coming change in\n  the law, but chose to remain until the old regime expired and\n  §241(a)(5) took its place. He had an opportunity to avoid the new\n  law’s application by leaving the country and ending his violation dur\n  ing the 6 months between IIRIRA’s enactment and effective date.\n  For that matter, he could have married his son’s mother and applied\n  for adjustment of status during the period, in which case he would at\n  least have had a claim that proven reliance on the law should be hon\n  ored by applying the presumption against retroactivity. Instead, he\n  augmented his 15 years of unlawful presence by remaining in the\n  country into the future subject to the new law. And the presumption\n  against retroactivity does not amount to a presumption of legal stasis\n  for the benefit of continuous lawbreakers.

The Illegal Immi\ngration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996\n(IIRIRA), Pub. L. 104–208, div. C, 110 Stat. 3009–546,\nenlarged the class of illegal reentrants whose orders may\nbe reinstated and limited the possible relief from a re\nmoval order available to them. See Immigration and\nNationality Act (INA), §241(a)(5), 66 Stat. 204, as added\nby IIRIRA §305(a)(3), 110 Stat. 3009–599, 8 U. S. C.\n§1231(a)(5). The questions here are whether the new\nversion of the reinstatement provision is correctly read to\napply to individuals who reentered the United States\nbefore IIRIRA’s effective date, and whether such a reading\nmay be rejected as impermissibly retroactive. We hold the\nstatute applies to those who entered before IIRIRA and\ndoes not retroactively affect any right of, or impose any\nburden on, the continuing violator of the INA now before\nus.\n2                FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v.

S. C. §156(d) (1946 ed.,\nSupp. V).2 Only specific illegal reentrants were subject to\nthe provision, those deported as “anarchists” or “subver\nsives,” for example, see §23(c), 64 Stat. 1012, while the\nrest got the benefit of the ordinary deportation rules.\nCongress retained a reinstatement provision two years\nlater when it revised the immigration laws through the\nINA, §242(f), 66 Stat. 212, as codified in this subsection:\n     “Should the Attorney General find that any alien has\n     unlawfully reentered the United States after having\n     previously departed or been deported pursuant to an\n     order of deportation, whether before or after June 27,\n     1952,3 on any ground described in subsection (e) . . . ,\n     the previous order of deportation shall be deemed to\n     be reinstated from its original date and such alien\n     shall be deported under such previous order at any\n     time subsequent to such reentry.” 8 U. S. C. §1252(f)\n     (1994 ed.).\n——————\n   1 What was formerly known as “deportation” is now called “removal”\n\nin IIRIRA. See Neuman, Habeas Corpus, Executive Detention, and the\nRemoval of Aliens, 98 Colum. L. Rev. 961, 966 (1998) (IIRIRA “re\naligned the vocabulary of immigration law, creating a new category of\n‘removal’ proceedings that largely replaces what were formerly exclu\nsion proceedings and deportation proceedings”). Our use of each term\nhere will vary according to the scheme under discussion.\n   2 This is the full text of the provision: “Should any alien subject to the\n\nprovisions of subsection (c) unlawfully return to the United States after\nhaving been released for departure or deported pursuant to this section,\nthe previous warrant of deportation against him shall be considered as\nreinstated from its original date of issuance.”\n   3 A date was inserted when the provision was codified; as originally\n\nenacted, the text read, “whether before or after the date of enactment of\nthis Act.” 66 Stat. 212.\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

S. C. §1254(a)(1) (1994 ed.)\n(suspension of deportation available to aliens who main\ntained a continuous presence in the United States for\nseven years and could demonstrate extreme hardship and\na good moral character).\n  In IIRIRA, Congress replaced this reinstatement provi\nsion with one that toed a harder line, as the old §242(f)\nwas displaced by the new §241(a)(5):\n     “If the Attorney General finds that an alien has reen\n     tered the United States illegally after having been\n     removed or having departed voluntarily, under an or\n     der of removal, the prior order of removal is reinstated\n     from its original date and is not subject to being re\n     opened or reviewed, the alien is not eligible and may\n     not apply for any relief under this chapter, and the\n     alien shall be removed under the prior order at any\n     time after the reentry.” 8 U. S. C. §1231(a)(5) (1994\n     ed., Supp. III).\nThe new law became effective on April 1, 1997, “the first\nday of the first month beginning more than 180 days after”\nIIRIRA’s enactment. §309(a), 110 Stat. 3009–625. Unlike\nits predecessor, §241(a)(5) applies to all illegal reentrants,\nexplicitly insulates the removal orders from review, and\ngenerally forecloses discretionary relief from the terms of\nthe reinstated order.4\n——————\n  4 Notwithstanding the absolute terms in which the bar on relief is\n\nstated, even an alien subject to §241(a)(5) may seek withholding of\nremoval under 8 U. S. C. §1231(b)(3)(A) (2000 ed.)

In 2001, Fernandez-Vargas married the boy’s\nmother, who is also a United States citizen. She soon filed\na relative-visa petition on behalf of her husband, see 8\nU. S. C. §§1154(a), 1151(b) (2000 ed.); see Fernandez-\nVargas v. Ashcroft, 394 F. 3d 881, 883, n. 4 (CA10 2005), on\nthe basis of which he filed an application to adjust his\nstatus to that of lawful permanent resident, see §1255(i).\nThe filings apparently tipped off the authorities to his\nillegal presence here, and in November 2003, the Govern\nment began proceedings under §241(a)(5) that eventuated\nin reinstating Fernandez-Vargas’s 1981 deportation order,\nbut without the possibility of adjusting his status to lawful\nresidence. He was detained for 10 months before being\nremoved to Juarez, Mexico in September 2004.\n   Fernandez-Vargas petitioned the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Tenth Circuit to review the reinstatement\norder. He took the position that because he illegally reen\ntered the country before IIRIRA’s effective date, the con\ntrolling reinstatement provision was the old §242(f), which\nmeant he was eligible to apply for adjustment of status as\nspouse of a citizen, and he said that the new §241(a)(5)\nwould be impermissibly retroactive if it barred his applica\ntion for adjustment. The Court of Appeals held that\n§241(a)(5) did bar Fernandez-Vargas’s application and\nfollowed Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.

The modern law\nthus follows Justice Story’s definition of a retroactive\nstatute, as “tak[ing] away or impair[ing] vested rights\nacquired under existing laws, or creat[ing] a new obliga\ntion, impos[ing] a new duty, or attach[ing] a new disabil\nity, in respect to transactions or considerations already\npast,” Society for the Propagation of the Gospel v.

The Courts of Appeals\nin the majority are themselves divided on the question whether an\nalien’s marriage or application for adjustment of status before the\nstatute’s effective date (facts not in play here) renders the statute\nimpermissibly retroactive when it is applied to the alien. See, e.g.,\nFaiz-Mohammad, supra, at 809–810 (application for adjustment of\nstatus); Alvarez-Portillo, supra, at 862, 867 (marriage).\n6            FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v. GONZALES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute shall not be given retroactive effect unless such\nconstruction is required by explicit language or by neces\nsary implication.” United States v. St. Louis, S. F. & T. R.\nCo., 270 U. S. 1, 3 (1926) (opinion for the Court by\nBrandeis, J.).\n   This Court has worked out a sequence of analysis when\nan objection is made to applying a particular statute said\nto affect a vested right or to impose some burden on the\nbasis of an act or event preceding the statute’s enactment.\nWe first look to “whether Congress has expressly pre\nscribed the statute’s proper reach,” Landgraf, supra, at\n280, and in the absence of language as helpful as that we\ntry to draw a comparably firm conclusion about the tem\nporal reach specifically intended by applying “our normal\nrules of construction,” Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 326\n(1997). If that effort fails, we ask whether applying the\nstatute to the person objecting would have a retroactive\nconsequence in the disfavored sense of “affecting substan\ntive rights, liabilities, or duties [on the basis of] conduct\narising before [its] enactment,” Landgraf, supra, at 278;\nsee also Lindh, supra, at 326. If the answer is yes, we\nthen apply the presumption against retroactivity by con\nstruing the statute as inapplicable to the event or act in\nquestion owing to the “absen[ce of] a clear indication from\nCongress that it intended such a result.” INS v. St. Cyr,\n533 U. S. 289, 316 (2001); see Martin v. Hadix, 527 U. S.\n343, 352 (1999) (quoting Landgraf, supra, at 280).\n   Fernandez-Vargas fights at each step of the way, argu\ning that Congress intended that INA §241(a)(5) would not\napply to illegal reentrants like him who returned to this\ncountry before the provision’s effective date; and in any\nevent, that application of the provision to such illegal\nreentrants would have an impermissibly retroactive effect,\nto be avoided by applying the presumption against it.

Section 242(f)\napplied to “any alien [who] has unlawfully reentered the\nUnited States after having previously departed or been\ndeported pursuant to an order of deportation, whether\nbefore or after June 27, 1952, on any ground described in\n. . . subsection (e).” 8 U. S. C. §1252(f) (1994 ed.). Accord\ning to Fernandez-Vargas, since that before-or-after clause\nmade it clear that the statute applied to aliens who reen\ntered before the enactment date of the earlier version, its\nelimination in the current iteration shows that Congress\nno longer meant to cover preenactment reentrants. See\nBrewster v. Gage, 280 U. S. 327, 337 (1930) (“deliberate\nselection of language . . . differing from that used in the\nearlier Acts” can indicate “that a change of law was in\n——————\n  6 The  Government urges us to forgo Landgraf analysis altogether\nbecause §241(a)(5) regulates only a present removal process, not past\nprimary conduct, citing our recent decision in Republic of Austria v.\nAltmann, 541 U. S. 677 (2004). Although we ultimately agree with the\nGovernment, in the abstract at least, that the reinstatement provision\nconcerns itself with postenactment affairs, see infra, at 13–15, we find\nthe Government’s allusion to Altmann inapt. The Court’s conclusion in\nthat case, that Landgraf was to be avoided, turned on the peculiarities\nof the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. See Altmann, supra, at 694–\n696. Those peculiarities are absent here, and we thus advert to Land\ngraf, as we ordinarily do.\n8              FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v. GONZALES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntended”); cf. 2B N. Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construc\ntion §51.04, p. 244 (6th rev. ed. 2000). But the clues are not\nthat simple.\n   To begin with, the old before-or-after clause was sand\nwiched between references to departure or deportation\nunder a deportation order and to grounds for deportation\nset out in a different subsection of the INA. It thus most\nnaturally referred not to the illegal reentry but to the\nalien’s previous deportation or departure. If its omission\nfrom the new subsection (a)(5) is significant, its immediate\nsignificance goes to the date of leaving this country, not\nthe date of illegal return. Since the old clause referred to\nthe date of enactment of the INA in 1952, the negative\nimplication argument from dropping the language is that\nthe reinstatement section no longer applies to those who\nleft the country before that date. But, in 1996, application\nkeyed to departures in 1952 or earlier was academic, and\nthe better inference is that the clause was removed for\nthat reason.7\n   If, moreover, we indulged any suggestion that omitting\nthe clause showed an intent to apply §241(a)(5) only to\ndeportations or departures after IIRIRA’s effective date,\nthe result would be a very strange one: it would exempt\nfrom the new reinstatement provision’s coverage anyone\nwho departed before IIRIRA’s effective date but reentered\nafter it. The point of the statute’s revision, however, was\nobviously to expand the scope of the reinstatement author\nity and invest it with something closer to finality, and it\nwould make no sense to infer that Congress meant to\nexcept the broad class of persons who had departed before\nthe time of enactment but who might return illegally at\nsome point in the future.\n——————\n  7 We therefore need not entertain Fernandez-Vargas’s argument that\n\nthe provision’s drafting history indicates that the language was elimi\nnated deliberately.\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Fernandez-Vargas sidesteps this problem (on a very\ngenerous reading of his argument) by making a more\ngeneral suggestion of congressional intent: whatever the\nevent to which the old law was tied, activity before as well\nas activity after it implicated the reinstatement power.\nSince the new law is bereft of such clarity, we should\napply the “ ‘longstanding principle of construing any lin\ngering ambiguities in deportation statutes in favor of the\nalien,’ ” St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 320 (quoting INS v. Car\ndoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421, 449 (1987)), which would\neffectively impose “[t]he presumption against retroactive\napplication of ambiguous statutory provisions,” St. Cyr,\nsupra, at 320. If we did so, we would find that §241(a)(5)\noperates only to reentries after its effective date.\n   Even at this amorphously general level, however, the\nargument suffers from two flaws, the first being that it\nputs the cart before the horse. As Fernandez-Vargas\nrealizes, he urges application of the presumption against\nretroactivity as a tool for interpreting the statute at the\nfirst Landgraf step. But if that were legitimate, a statute\nlacking an express provision about temporal reach would\nnever be construed as having a retroactive potential and\nthe final two steps in the Landgraf enquiry would never\noccur (that is, asking whether the statute would produce a\nretroactive effect, and barring any such application by\napplying the presumption against retroactivity). It is not\nuntil a statute is shown to have no firm provision about\ntemporal reach but to produce a retroactive effect when\nstraightforwardly applied that the presumption has its\nwork to do. See 511 U. S., at 280.\n   The second flaw is the argument’s failure to account for\nthe new statute’s other provisions on temporal reach, from\nwhich one might draw a negative inference that subsec\ntion (a)(5) was (or at least may well have been) meant to\napply to reentries before its effective date. In contrast to\ntheir silence about the temporal sweep of §241(a)(5), the\n10             FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v. GONZALES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n1996 amendments speak directly to the scope of changes\nin provisions making reentry criminal and setting civil\npenalties. IIRIRA §324(c), 110 Stat. 3009–629, note fol\nlowing 8 U. S. C. §1326 (2000 ed.), provides that the ex\npanded criminal prohibitions, see §1326(a), apply only to\nreentries or attempts after the effective date, and §105(b),\n110 Stat. 3009–556, note following 8 U. S. C. §1325, pro\nvides the same as to civil penalties for illegal reentry, see\n§1325(b). The point here is not that these provisions alone\nwould support an inference of intent to apply the rein\nstatement provision retroactively, see Lindh, 521 U. S., at\n328, n. 4, for we require a clear statement for that, see\nMartin, 527 U. S., at 354. But these provisions do blunt\nany argument that removal of the before-or-after clause\nsuffices to establish the applicability of §241(a)(5) only to\nposteffective date reentries. The fact is that IIRIRA some\ntimes expressly made changes prospective as from its\neffective date and sometimes expressly provided they were\napplicable to earlier acts; compare §§324(c) and 105(b),\nwith §347(c), 110 Stat. 3009–639 (provision governing\nremoval of aliens who have unlawfully voted is applicable\n“to voting occurring before, on, or after the date of the\nenactment of this Act”), and §351(c), id., at 3009–640\n(provision applicable to “waivers filed before, on, or after\nthe date of the enactment of this Act”). With such a vari\nety of treatment, it is just too hard to infer any clear inten\ntion at any level of generality from the fact of retiring the\nold before-or-after language from what is now §241(a)(5).\n   One conclusion can be stated, however. Common prin\nciples of statutory interpretation fail to unsettle the ap\nparent application of §241(a)(5) to any reentrant present\nin the country, whatever the date of return.8\n——————\n  8 JUSTICE STEVENS states that when, in 1952, Congress inserted the\n\nbefore-or-after clause with the old §242(f), it was responding to the\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (INS) practice of applying the\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006) \n                  11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\n                              B\n\n  This facial reading is confirmed by two features of\nIIRIRA, not previously discussed, that describe the con\nduct to which §241(a)(5) applies, and show that the appli\ncation suffers from no retroactivity in denying Fernandez-\nVargas the opportunity for adjustment of status as the\nspouse of a citizen of the United States.9 One is in the text\nof that provision itself, showing that it applies to Fernan\ndez-Vargas today not because he reentered in 1982 or at\nany other particular time, but because he chose to remain\nafter the new statute became effective. The second is the\nprovision setting IIRIRA’s effective date, §309(a), 110 Stat.\n3009–625, which shows that Fernandez-Vargas had an\nample warning of the coming change in the law, but chose\n——————\nreinstatement provision only to deportation orders issued after the\nprovision’s enactment, a practice that necessarily meant INS applied\nthe provision only to postenactment reentries. By correcting the INS’s\ninterpretation only as to deportation orders, JUSTICE STEVENS suggests,\nCongress did nothing to disturb the practice as to reentries. And when\nit removed the obsolete before-or-after clause in 1996 without adding\nalternative language of temporal reach, the argument goes, Congress\nheld fast to its intent in 1950 and 1952 to apply the reinstatement\nprovision only to postenactment reentries. But the INS’s practice circa\n1951 of applying the reinstatement provision only to postenactment\nreentries followed from its policy regarding deportation orders, and in\n1952 Congress might just as easily have assumed that the branch\nwould go the way of the root. In any event, it is difficult to accept\nJUSTICE STEVENS’s view that congressional understanding from 40\nyears back was intended to govern the IIRIRA reinstatement provision,\ngiven Congress’s care to make the revised criminal and civil penalties\napplicable only to postenactment reentries.\n   9 We would reach the same conclusion about denial of opportunities to\n\napply for permission for voluntary departure as an alternative to\nremoval, see 8 U. S. C. §1229c, and about cancellation of removal, see\n§1229b(b), if there were a need to deal with these matters separately.\nAlthough Fernandez-Vargas argues that he is being denied the chance\nto seek these forms of relief, he never applied for either of them and has\nnot formally attempted to claim them in response to the reinstatement\nand removal proceedings.\n12            FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v. GONZALES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto remain until the old regime expired and §241(a)(5) took\nits place.\n   As a preface to identifying the conduct by Fernandez-\nVargas to which the reinstatement provision applies (the\nconduct that results in reinstating the old deportation\norder without the former opportunities to seek adjustment\nof status), a look at our holding in St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, is\nhelpful. The alien, St. Cyr, was a lawful, permanent\nresident who made a plea agreement and pleaded guilty to\nan aggravated felony charge. Although the resulting\nconviction justified his deportation, when he entered his\nplea the law allowed him to seek a waiver of deportation\nat the discretion of the Attorney General. Between the\nplea and deportation proceedings, however, IIRIRA and\nanother statute repealed the provision for that discretion\nary relief, converting deportation from a possibility to a\ncertainty. Id., at 325. The question was whether Land\ngraf barred application of the new law eliminating discre\ntionary relief, on the ground that applying it to a defen\ndant who pleaded guilty before the enactment of the new\nlaw would attach a further burdensome consequence to his\nplea, amounting to “a new disability, in respect to transac\ntions or considerations already past,” 533 U. S., at 321\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The answer was that\nconverting deportation from a likely possibility to a dead\ncertainty would add such a burden, and application of the\nnew law was accordingly barred. Id., at 325. In making\nthis “commonsense, functional judgment,” Martin, supra,\nat 357, we emphasized that plea agreements “involve a\nquid pro quo between a criminal defendant and the gov\nernment,” St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 321, in which a waiver of\n“constitutional rights (including the right to a trial),” had\nbeen exchanged for a “perceived benefit,” id., at 322, which\nin practical terms was valued in light of the possible dis\ncretionary relief, a focus of expectation and reliance, id., at\n323.\n                      Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                       13\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   St. Cyr’s agreement for a quid pro quo and his plea were\nentirely past, and there was no question of undoing them,\nbut the “transactio[n] or consideratio[n]” on which\n§241(a)(5) turns is different.10 While the law looks back to\na past act in its application to “an alien [who] has reen\ntered . . . illegally,” 8 U. S. C. §1231(a)(5), the provision\ndoes not penalize an alien for the reentry (criminal and\ncivil penalties do that); it establishes a process to remove\nhim “under the prior order at any time after the reentry.”\nIbid. Thus, it is the conduct of remaining in the country\nafter entry that is the predicate action; the statute applies\nto stop an indefinitely continuing violation that the alien\nhimself could end at any time by voluntarily leaving the\ncountry. It is therefore the alien’s choice to continue his\nillegal presence, after illegal reentry and after the effective\ndate of the new law, that subjects him to the new and less\ngenerous legal regime, not a past act that he is helpless to\nundo up to the moment the Government finds him out.\n   That in itself is enough to explain that Fernandez-\nVargas has no retroactivity claim based on a new disabil\n——————\n  10 We  understand Fernandez-Vargas’s claim as falling within the\nsecond of Justice Story’s categories of retroactivity (new consequences\nof past acts), not the first category of canceling vested rights. The\nforms of relief identified by Fernandez-Vargas as rendered unavailable\nto him by §241(a)(5) include cancellation of removal, see 8 U. S. C.\n§1229b(b), adjustment of status, see §1255, and voluntary departure,\nsee §1229c. These putative claims to relief are not “vested rights,” a\nterm that describes something more substantial than inchoate expecta\ntions and unrealized opportunities. In contrast to “an immediate fixed\nright of present or future enjoyment,” Pearsall v. Great Northern R. Co.,\n161 U. S. 646, 673 (1896) (internal quotation marks omitted), Fernandez-\nVargas’s claim to such relief was contingent, and it was up to him to take\nsome action that would elevate it above the level of hope. It is not that\nthese forms of relief are discretionary, cf. St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 325; it is\nrather that before IIRIRA’s effective date Fernandez-Vargas never availed\nhimself of them or took action that enhanced their significance to him in\nparticular, as St. Cyr did in making his quid pro quo agreement, see\nsupra, at 11–12.\n14              FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v. GONZALES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nity consequent to a completed act, but in fact his position\nis weaker still. For Fernandez-Vargas could not only have\nchosen to end his continuing violation and his exposure to\nthe less favorable law, he even had an ample warning that\nthe new law could be applied to him and ample opportu\nnity to avoid that very possibility by leaving the country\nand ending his violation in the period between enactment\nof §241(a)(5) and its effective date. IRRIRA became law on\nSeptember 30, 1996, but it became effective and enforce\nable only on “the first day of the first month beginning\nmore than 180 days after” IIRIRA’s enactment, that is,\nApril 1, 1997. §309(a), 110 Stat. 3009–625. Unlawful\nalien reentrants like Fernandez-Vargas thus had the\nadvantage of a grace period between the unequivocal\nwarning that a tougher removal regime lay ahead and\nactual imposition of the less opportune terms of the new\nlaw. In that stretch of six months, Fernandez-Vargas\ncould have ended his illegal presence and potential expo\nsure to the coming law by crossing back into Mexico.11 For\n——————\n  11 In a series of letters submitted to the Court after oral argument,\n\nthe parties dispute the consequences if Fernandez-Vargas had left\nvoluntarily after IIRIRA’s enactment and, specifically, the period of\ninadmissibility to which Fernandez-Vargas would thereupon have been\nsubject. Because we conclude that §241(a)(5) does not operate on a\ncompleted pre-enactment act, we need not consider the retroactive\nimplications either of the fact of his inadmissibility or of any variance\nbetween the period of inadmissibility upon a postenactment voluntary\nreturn and that prescribed under the old regime. The period of inad\nmissibility stems from an alien’s illegal reentry within a specified time\nafter a prior removal and is applicable to Fernandez-Vargas because he\nreentered shortly after his 1981 deportation, but Fernandez-Vargas\ndoes not challenge as impermissibly retroactive IIRIRA’s lengthening of\nthat period from 5 to 10 or 20 years, see 8 U. S. C. §1182(a)(6)(B) (1994\ned.); §1182(a)(9)(A)(ii) (2000 ed.).\n  In any event, any period of inadmissibility is subject to waiver by the\nAttorney General, see §1182(a)(6)(B) (1994 ed.); §1182(a)(9)(A)(iii)\n(2000 ed.), and presumably Fernandez-Vargas could plead his serious\ncase for such a waiver (his marriage, his child) in seeking legal reentry\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat matter, he could have married the mother of his son\nand applied for adjustment of status during that period, in\nwhich case he would at least have had a claim (about\nwhich we express no opinion) that proven reliance on the\nold law should be honored by applying the presumption\nagainst retroactivity.12\n   Fernandez-Vargas did not, however, take advantage of\nthe statutory warning, but augmented his past 15 years of\nunlawful presence by remaining in the country into the\nfuture subject to the new law, whose applicability thus\nturned not on the completed act of reentry, but on a failure\nto take timely action that would have avoided application\nof the new law altogether. To be sure, a choice to avoid\nthe new law before its effective date or to end the continu\ning violation thereafter would have come at a high per\nsonal price, for Fernandez-Vargas would have had to leave\na business and a family he had established during his\nillegal residence. But the branch of retroactivity law that\nconcerns us here is meant to avoid new burdens imposed\non completed acts, not all difficult choices occasioned by\nnew law. What Fernandez-Vargas complains of is the\napplication of new law to continuously illegal action within\nhis control both before and after the new law took effect. He\nclaims a right to continue illegal conduct indefinitely under\nthe terms on which it began, an entitlement of legal stasis\nfor those whose lawbreaking is continuous. But “[i]f every\ntime a man relied on existing law in arranging his affairs,\nhe were made secure against any change in legal rules, the\nwhole body of our law would be ossified forever.” L.

JUSTICE STEVENS thus argues that\nreimposing an order of removal to end illegal residence is like imposing\na penalty for a completed act (the defendant’s unspecified act in his\nanalogy). But even on his own analysis, Fernandez-Vargas continued\nto violate the law by remaining in this country day after day, and\nJUSTICE STEVENS does not deny that the United States was entitled to\nbring that continuing violation to an end. He says, however, that\nCongress should not be understood to provide that if the violation\ncontinues into the future it may be ended on terms less favorable than\nthose at the beginning. But this is not the position that retroactivity\ndoctrine imputes to an inexplicit Congress. Fernandez-Vargas may\nhave an equitable argument that the Government should not, for the\nfuture, eliminate an opportunity for continuing illegality accompanied\nby the hopes that long illegal residence and a prospect of marriage gave\nhim in the past. But Congress apparently did not accept such an\nargument, which could prevail here only if the presumption against\nretroactivity amounted to a presumption of legal stasis for the benefit\nof continuous lawbreakers.\n                    Cite as: 548 U.

Over the next 20 years, petitioner\nremained here. He worked as a truckdriver, owned a\ntrucking business, fathered a child, and eventually mar\nried the child’s mother, a United States citizen. The laws\nin place at the time of petitioner’s entry and for the first\n15 years of his residence in this country would have re\nwarded this behavior, allowing him to seek discretionary\nrelief from deportation on the basis of his continued pres\nence in and strong ties to the United States. See 8 U. S. C.\n§1254(a)(1) (1994 ed.).\n   In 1996, however, Congress passed a new version of the\napplicable provision eliminating almost entirely the possi\nbility of relief from deportation for aliens who reenter the\ncountry illegally having previously been deported. See\nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibil\nity Act (IIRIRA), §305(a)(3), 110 Stat. 3009–599, 8 U. S. C.\n§1231(a)(5) (2000 ed.); see also ante, at 3, n. 4. The 1996\nprovision is silent as to whether it was intended to apply\nretroactively to conduct that predated its enactment.1\n——————\n  1 The statutory provisions expanding the class of people to whom\n\ncriminal penalties for illegal reentry might apply, however, explicitly\n2               FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v. GONZALES\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nDespite a historical practice supporting petitioner’s read\ning, and despite the harsh consequences that attend its\napplication to thousands of individuals who, like peti\ntioner, entered the country illegally before 1997, the Court\nnot only holds that the statute applies to preenactment\nreentries but also that it has no retroactive effect. I dis\nagree with both of these conclusions.\n                              I\n  In 1950, when Congress first gave the Attorney General\nthe authority to reinstate an order of deportation, it en\nacted a reinstatement provision containing no explicit\ntemporal reach.2 See Internal Security Act, §23(d), 64\nStat. 1012, 8 U. S. C. §156(d) (1946 ed., Supp. V). The\nnatural reading of this provision, the one most consistent\nwith the “deeply rooted” traditional presumption against\nretroactivity, Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S.\n244, 265 (1994), is that it would apply to deportations that\noccurred before the provision’s enactment but not to\npreenactment reentries.       While both deportation and\nreentry can constitute “events completed before [the provi\nsion’s] enactment,” id., at 270, an alien’s reentry is the act\nthat triggers the provision’s operation and is therefore the\nact to which the provision attaches legal consequences.\n  When the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)\npromulgated regulations implementing the 1950 statute,\nhowever, it did not read the statute so naturally. Instead,\nthe INS’ regulations, embodying an overly strong version\n——————\napply only to postenactment reentries. See IIRIRA, §324(c), 110 Stat.\n3009–629, note following 8 U. S. C. §1326.\n  2 The provision stated:\n\n“Should any alien subject to the provisions of subsection (c) unlawfully\nreturn to the United States after having been released for departure or\ndeported pursuant to this section, the previous war-rant of deportation\nagainst him shall be considered as reinstated from its original date of\nissuance.” 64 Stat. 1012, codified as 8 U. S. C. §156(d) (1946 ed., Supp.\nV).\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)             3\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nof the presumption against retroactivity, provided that an\norder of deportation could only be reinstated if that depor\ntation occurred after the statute’s enactment date. See 8\nCFR §152.5 (1950 Cum. Supp.). Thus, the INS read the\nreinstatement provision as inapplicable even to reentries\nthat occurred after the statute’s enactment date if the\nunderlying deportation had been entered before that date;\nit follows a fortiori that the provision was considered\ninapplicable to reentries that occurred before the statute’s\nenactment.\n   Congress corrected the INS’ error two years later by\nadding the clause “whether before or after the date of\nenactment of this Act.” Immigration and Nationality Act,\n§242(f), 66 Stat. 212, 8 U. S. C. §1252(f) (1994 ed.); see also\nante, at 2, and nn. 2–3. As the Court correctly notes, that\namendment “most naturally referred not to the illegal\nreentry but to the alien’s previous deportation or depar\nture.” Ante, at 8. The best interpretation of Congress’\nintent with regard to the 1952 statute, then, was that it\nmeant to apply the reinstatement provision to preenact\nment deportations but to preserve the status quo with\nregard to preenactment reentries: In accordance with the\ntraditional presumption against retroactivity, preenact\nment reentries would remain uncovered by the reinstate\nment provision.\n   In 1996, when Congress enacted the current reinstate\nment provision, it drafted a version of the statute that,\nlike its 1950 predecessor, was silent as to its temporal\nreach. See 8 U. S. C. §1231(a)(5) (2000 ed.). If we assume\n(as the Court does) that the addition of the “before-or\nafter” clause in the 1952 statute merely clarified Congress’\noriginal intent in 1950 to make the provision applicable to\npreenactment departures without authorizing any appli\ncation to preenactment reentries, it is reasonable to at\ntribute precisely the same intent to the Congress that\nenacted the 1996 statute: As in the 1950 and 1952 ver\n4               FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v. GONZALES\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nsions of the provision, Congress intended the 1996 rein\nstatement provision to apply to preenactment deportations\nbut not to preenactment reentries.\n  In sum, our normal rules of construction support the\nreasonable presumption that Congress intended the provi\nsion to cover only postenactment reentries. Accordingly,\nthe 1996 reinstatement provision should not be construed\nto apply to petitioner’s earlier entry into the United\nStates.\n                              II\n   The Court not only fails to give the 1996 Act its most\nnormal interpretation, but also erroneously concludes that\nthe provision does not have any retroactive effect. The\nCourt reaches this conclusion based on its judgment that\nthe provision applies not to conduct that occurred before\nthe statute’s enactment date, but rather to “an indefinitely\ncontinuing violation that the alien himself could end at\nany time by voluntarily leaving the country.” Ante, at 13.\nThis reasoning is unpersuasive.\n   It is true, of course, that the order of deportation en\ntered against petitioner in 1981 could not be reinstated\nunless he was present in the United States, and that, until\nhe was arrested in 2003, petitioner could have chosen to\nleave the United States. But it is precisely petitioner’s\n“continuing violation” that allowed him to be eligible for\nrelief from deportation in the first place: He was required\nto have been physically present in the United States for a\nperiod of not less than seven years, to have been a person\nof good moral character during that time, and to have\ndeveloped ties to the United States such that his deporta\ntion would result in extreme hardship to himself or to his\nUnited States citizen wife or child.3 See 8 U. S. C.\n——————\n  3 Although petitioner became eligible for relief from deportation after\n\nbeing physically present in the United States for seven years, he could\nnot apply for that relief until the Government placed him in deporta\n                    Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                   5\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n§1254(a)(1) (1994 ed.); see also INS v. Phinpathya, 464\nU. S. 183 (1984) (strictly construing physical presence\nrequirement). Moreover, under the pre-1996 version of\nthe reinstatement provision, the longer petitioner re\nmained in the United States the more likely he was to be\ngranted relief from deportation. See Matter of Ige, 20 I.\n& N. Dec. 880, 882 (1994) (listing factors considered in\nevaluating extreme hardship requirement, including\nalien’s length of residence in United States, family in\nUnited States, business or occupation, and position in\ncommunity).\n  Given these incentives, petitioner legitimately com\nplains that the Government has changed the rules\nmidgame. At the time of his entry, and for the next 15\nyears, it inured to petitioner’s benefit for him to remain in\nthe United States continuously, to build a business, and to\nstart a family. After April 1, 1997, the date on which the\napplicable reinstatement provision became effective, all of\nthese activities were rendered irrelevant in the eyes of the\nlaw. Only the Court’s unfortunately formalistic search for\na single “past act that [petitioner] is helpless to undo,”\nante, at 13, allows it to conclude that the provision at issue\nhas no retroactive effect.4 For regardless of whether his\n——————\ntion proceedings, at which point he could raise his eligibility as an\naffirmative defense. Cf. Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel.\nSchumer, 520 U. S. 939, 951–952 (1997) (applying presumption against\nretroactivity to statute eliminating affirmative defense).\n   4 Even on its own terms the Court’s logic is troubling. The Court\n\nbelieves that petitioner could have avoided being affected by the 1996\nreinstatement provision, not just retroactively but in any way whatso\never, by leaving the country prior to its effective date—a date that\noccurred six months after the statute’s enactment date not to give\naliens “ample warning,” ante, at 11, 13, but instead to allow the Attor\nney General to prepare for the substantial changes caused by the\nIIRIRA and to promulgate regulations to effectuate that Act. See §309,\n110 Stat. 3009–625. But had petitioner “take[n] advantage of the\nstatutory warning,” ante, at 15, he would have imposed upon himself\n6               FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v. GONZALES\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n1982 reentry was or was not an act that he could now\n“undo,” it is certainly an act to which the 1996 reinstate\nment provision has attached serious adverse conse\nquences. Because the provision has an undeniably harsh\nretroactive effect, “absent a clear indication from Congress\nthat it intended such a result,” INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S.\n289, 316 (2001), we should apply the presumption against\nretroactivity and hold that the 1996 reinstatement provi\nsion does not apply to petitioner.\n  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n——————\nthe very same punishment—the guarantee of removal to Mexico—that\nhe hopes to avoid. Just as we would not say that a defendant may\navoid the retroactive application of a criminal statute by locking him\nself up for 10 years, it cannot be that petitioner’s ability to leave the\ncountry of his own accord somehow helps to prove that the provision at\nissue has no retroactive effect.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145637/", "sha1": "be402899c4a64ba5ed8b44af15c85ffe747c2142", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2005-074", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:06:13"}
