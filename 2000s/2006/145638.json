UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 05–7053. Argued April 25, 2006—Decided June 22, 2006\nPetitioner was charged with receiving a firearm while under indictment\n  in violation of 18 U. S. C. §922(n) and with making false statements\n  in connection with the acquisition of a firearm in violation of\n  §922(a)(6). She admitted at trial that she knew she was under in\n  dictment when she purchased the firearms and knew that doing so\n  was a crime, but claimed that she was acting under duress because\n  her boyfriend had threatened to harm her and her daughters if she\n  did not buy the guns for him. Bound by Fifth Circuit precedent, the\n  District Court declined her request for a jury instruction placing\n  upon the Government the burden to disprove, beyond a reasonable\n  doubt, her duress defense. Instead, the jury was instructed that peti\n  tioner had the burden to establish her defense by a preponderance of\n  the evidence. She was convicted, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. The jury instructions did not run afoul of the Due Process\n Clause. The crimes of conviction require that petitioner have acted\n “knowingly,” §922(a)(6)—which “merely requires proof of knowledge\n of the facts that constitute the offense,” Bryan v. United States, 524\n U. S. 184, 193—or “willfully,” §924(a)(1)(D)—which requires acting\n “with knowledge that [the] conduct was unlawful,” ibid. Thus, the\n Government bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt\n that petitioner knew that she was making false statements and knew\n that she was breaking the law when she acquired a firearm while\n under indictment. It clearly met its burden when petitioner testified\n to that effect. Petitioner contends that she cannot have formed the\n necessary mens rea because she did not freely choose to commit the\n crimes. However, while the duress defense may excuse conduct that\n would otherwise be punishable, see United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S.\n2                      DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    394, 409–410, the existence of duress normally does not controvert\n    any of the elements of the offense itself. The fact that petitioner’s\n    crimes are statutory offenses with no counterpart in the common law\n    supports this conclusion. The jury instructions were consistent with\n    the requirement that the Government prove the mental states speci\n    fied in §§922(a)(6) and 924(a)(1)(D) and did not run afoul of due proc\n    ess by placing the burden on petitioner to establish duress by a pre\n    ponderance of the evidence. Pp. 3–5.\n       2. Modern common law does not require the Government to bear\n    the burden of disproving petitioner’s duress defense beyond a reason\n    able doubt. The long-established common-law rule, which places the\n    burden of proving that defense on the defendant, was not upset by\n    Davis v. United States, 160 U. S. 469. There, the Court interpreted a\n    defendant’s insanity to controvert the necessary mens rea for a mur\n    der committed “feloniously, wilfully, and of his malice aforethought,”\n    id., at 474, and required the Government to prove the defendant’s\n    sanity beyond a reasonable doubt because the evidence tending to\n    prove insanity also tended to disprove an essential element of the of\n    fense. The duress evidence that petitioner adduced at trial does not\n    contradict or tend to disprove any element of her statutory offenses.\n    She is also not helped by the resulting “Davis rule,” which was not\n    constitutionally mandated, and which Congress overruled by statute,\n    requiring a defendant to prove insanity by clear and convincing evi\n    dence.\n       Petitioner’s reliance on Davis also ignores the fact that federal\n    crimes are “solely creatures of statute,” Liparota v. United States,\n    471 U. S. 419, 424, and thus the Court must effectuate the duress de\n    fense as Congress “may have contemplated” it in the context of these\n    specific offenses, United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Coop\n    erative, 532 U. S. 483, 490, n. 3. The Court can assume that, when\n    passing the relevant 1968 Act, Congress was familiar with the long-\n    established common-law rule and the rule of McKelvey v. United\n    States, 260 U. S. 353, 357—that the one relying on an affirmative de\n    fense must set it up and establish it—and would have expected fed\n    eral courts to apply a similar approach to any affirmative defense or\n    excuse for violating the new law. To accept petitioner’s contrary hy\n    pothesis that Davis dramatically upset well-settled law would require\n    an overwhelming consensus among federal courts placing the burden\n    on the Government, but conflict among the Circuits demonstrates\n    that such consensus has never existed. For a similar reason, no\n    weight is due the 1962 Model Penal Code. There is no evidence that\n    Congress endorsed the Code’s views or incorporated them into the\n    1968 Act. In fact, when Congress amended the Act to add a mens rea\n    requirement, it punished “willful” violations, a mental state not em\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

Effectuating the affirmative defense as Congress\n  may have contemplated it, the Court presumes that, in the context of\n  the firearms offenses here and the long-established common-law rule,\n  Congress intended petitioner to bear the burden of proving the duress\n  defense by a preponderance of the evidence.

As a\nresult of these illegal acts, petitioner was indicted and\nconvicted on one count of receiving a firearm while under\nindictment in violation of 18 U. S. C. §922(n) and eight\ncounts of making false statements in connection with the\nacquisition of a firearm in violation of §922(a)(6). At trial,\npetitioner admitted that she knew she was under indict\nment when she made the purchases and that she knew\ndoing so was a crime; her defense was that she acted\nunder duress because her boyfriend threatened to kill her\nor hurt her daughters if she did not buy the guns for him.\n  Petitioner contends that the trial judge’s instructions to\nthe jury erroneously required her to prove duress by a\npreponderance of the evidence instead of requiring the\nGovernment to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she\ndid not act under duress. The Court of Appeals rejected\npetitioner’s contention, 413 F. 3d 520 (CA5 2005); given\n2                     DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncontrary treatment of the issue by other federal courts,1\nwe granted certiorari, 546 U. S. __ (2006).\n                              I\n  At trial, in her request for jury instructions on her\ndefense of duress, petitioner contended that she “should\nhave the burden of production, and then that the Govern\nment should be required to disprove beyond a reasonable\ndoubt the duress.” App. 300. Petitioner admitted that\nthis request was contrary to Fifth Circuit precedent, and\nthe trial court, correctly finding itself bound by Circuit\nprecedent, denied petitioner’s request. Ibid. Instead, the\njudge’s instructions to the jury defined the elements of the\nduress defense2 and stated that petitioner has “the burden\nof proof to establish the defense of duress by a preponder\nance of the evidence.” Id., at 312.\n  Petitioner argues here, as she did in the District Court\nand the Court of Appeals, that federal law requires the\nGovernment to bear the burden of disproving her defense\nbeyond a reasonable doubt and that the trial court’s erro\n\n——————\n    1 Cf.,\n        e.g., United States v.

Simpson, 979 F. 2d 1282, 1287 (CA8 1992).\n  2 There is no federal statute defining the elements of the duress de\n\nfense. We have not specified the elements of the defense, see, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 409–410 (1980), and need not do\nso today. Instead, we presume the accuracy of the District Court’s\ndescription of these elements: (1) The defendant was under an unlawful\nand imminent threat of such a nature as to induce a well-grounded\napprehension of death or serious bodily injury; (2) the defendant had\nnot recklessly or negligently placed herself in a situation in which it\nwas probable that she would be forced to perform the criminal conduct;\n(3) the defendant had no reasonable, legal alternative to violating the\nlaw, that is, a chance both to refuse to perform the criminal act and also\nto avoid the threatened harm; and, (4) that a direct causal relationship\nmay be reasonably anticipated between the criminal act and the avoid\nance of the threatened harm. See App. 312–313; see generally United\nStates v. Harper, 802 F. 2d 115, 118 (CA5 1986).\n                    Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                  3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nneous instruction on this point entitles her to a new trial.\nThere are two aspects to petitioner’s argument in support\nof her proposed instruction that merit separate discussion.\nFirst, petitioner contends that her defense “controverted\nthe mens rea required for conviction” and therefore that\nthe Due Process Clause requires the Government to retain\nthe burden of persuasion on that element. Brief for Peti\ntioner 41. Second, petitioner argues that Fifth Circuit’s\nrule is “contrary to modern common law.” Id., at 14.\n                              II\n   The crimes for which petitioner was convicted require\nthat she have acted “knowingly,” §922(a)(6), or “willfully,”\n§924(a)(1)(D).3 As we have explained, “unless the text of\nthe statute dictates a different result, the term ‘knowingly’\nmerely requires proof of knowledge of the facts that consti\ntute the offense.” Bryan v. United States, 524 U. S. 184,\n193 (1998) (footnote omitted). And the term “willfully” in\n§924(a)(1)(D) requires a defendant to have “acted with\nknowledge that his conduct was unlawful.” Ibid. In this\ncase, then, the Government bore the burden of proving\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner knew she was\nmaking false statements in connection with the acquisi\ntion of firearms and that she knew she was breaking the\nlaw when she acquired a firearm while under indictment.\nSee In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970). Although the\nGovernment may have proved these elements in other\nways, it clearly met its burden when petitioner testified\nthat she knowingly committed certain acts—she put a\nfalse address on the forms she completed to purchase the\nfirearms, falsely claimed that she was the actual buyer of\nthe firearms, and falsely stated that she was not under\nindictment at the time of the purchase—and when she\n——————\n  3 Although §922(n) does not contain a mens rea requirement, the rele\n\nvant sentencing provision, §924(a)(1)(D), requires that a violation be\ncommitted willfully.\n4                     DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntestified that she knew she was breaking the law when, as\nan individual under indictment at the time, she purchased\na firearm. App. 221–222.\n  Petitioner contends, however, that she cannot have\nformed the necessary mens rea for these crimes because\nshe did not freely choose to commit the acts in question.\nBut even if we assume that petitioner’s will was overborne\nby the threats made against her and her daughters, she\nstill knew that she was making false statements and knew\nthat she was breaking the law by buying a firearm. The\nduress defense, like the defense of necessity that we con\nsidered in United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 409–410\n(1980), may excuse conduct that would otherwise be pun\nishable, but the existence of duress normally does not\ncontrovert any of the elements of the offense itself.4 As we\nexplained in Bailey, “[c]riminal liability is normally based\nupon the concurrence of two factors, ‘an evil-meaning\nmind [and] and evil-doing hand . . . .’ ” Id., at 402 (quoting\nMorissette v. United States, 342 U. S. 246, 251 (1952)).\nLike the defense of necessity, the defense of duress does\nnot negate a defendant’s criminal state of mind when the\napplicable offense requires a defendant to have acted\nknowingly or willfully; instead, it allows the defendant to\n“avoid liability . . . because coercive conditions or necessity\nnegates a conclusion of guilt even though the necessary\nmens rea was present.” Bailey, 444 U. S., at 402.5\n——————\n   4 As the Government recognized at oral argument, there may be\n\ncrimes where the nature of the mens rea would require the Government\nto disprove the existence of duress beyond a reasonable doubt. See Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 26–27; see also, e.g., 1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal\nLaw §5.1, p. 333 (2d ed. 2003) (hereinafter LaFave) (explaining that\nsome common-law crimes require that the crime be done “ ‘mali\nciously’ ”); Black’s Law Dictionary 968 (7th ed. 1999) (defining malice as\n“[t]he intent, without justification or excuse, to commit a wrongful act”).\n   5 Professor LaFave has explained the duress defense as follows:\n\n   “The rationale of the defense is not that the defendant, faced with the\nunnerving threat of harm unless he does an act which violates the\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  The fact that petitioner’s crimes are statutory offenses\nthat have no counterpart in the common law also supports\nour conclusion that her duress defense in no way disproves\nan element of those crimes. We have observed that “[t]he\ndefinition of the elements of a criminal offense is en\ntrusted to the legislature, particularly in the case of fed\neral crimes, which are solely creatures of statute.” Lipa\nrota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419, 424 (1985). Here,\nconsistent with the movement away from the traditional\ndichotomy of general versus specific intent and toward a\nmore specifically defined hierarchy of culpable mental\nstates, see Bailey, 444 U. S., at 403–404, Congress defined\nthe crimes at issue to punish defendants who act “know\ningly,” §922(a)(6), or “willfully,” §924(a)(1)(D). It is these\nspecific mental states, rather than some vague “evil mind,”\nBrief for Petitioner 42, or “ ‘criminal’ intent,” Martin v.\nOhio, 480 U. S. 228, 235 (1987), that the Government is\nrequired to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, see Patterson\nv. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 211, n. 12 (1977) (“The appli\ncability of the reasonable-doubt standard, however, has\nalways been dependent on how a State defines the offense\nthat is charged in any given case”). The jury instructions\nin this case were consistent with this requirement and, as\nsuch, did not run afoul of the Due Process Clause when\nthey placed the burden on petitioner to establish the\nexistence of duress by a preponderance of the evidence.\n                         III\n  Having found no constitutional basis for placing upon\nthe Government the burden of disproving petitioner’s\n——————\nliteral language of the criminal law, somehow loses his mental capacity\nto commit the crime in question. Nor is it that the defendant has not\nengaged in a voluntary act. Rather it is that, even though he has done\nthe act the crime requires and has the mental state which the crime\nrequires, his conduct which violates the literal language of the criminal\nlaw is excused . . . .” 2 LaFave §9.7(a), at 72 (footnote omitted).\n6                 DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nduress defense beyond a reasonable doubt, we next ad\ndress petitioner’s argument that the modern common law\nrequires the Government to bear that burden. In making\nthis argument, petitioner recognizes that, until the end of\nthe 19th century, common-law courts generally adhered to\nthe rule that “the proponent of an issue bears the burden\nof persuasion on the factual premises for applying the\nrule.” Fletcher, Two Kinds of Legal Rules: A Comparative\nStudy of Burden-of-Persuasion Practices in Criminal\nCases, 77 Yale L. J. 880, 898 (1967–1968). In petitioner’s\nview, however, two important developments have estab\nlished a contrary common-law rule that now prevails in\nfederal courts: this Court’s decision in Davis v. United\nStates, 160 U. S. 469 (1895), which placed the burden on\nthe Government to prove a defendant’s sanity, and the\npublication of the Model Penal Code in 1962.\n   Although undisputed in this case, it bears repeating\nthat, at common law, the burden of proving “affirmative\ndefenses—indeed, ‘all circumstances . . . of justification,\nexcuse or alleviation’—rested on the defendant.” Patter\nson, 432 U. S., at 202 (quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commen\ntaries *201); see also Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S., at 235;\nMullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 693 (1975). This com\nmon-law rule accords with the general evidentiary rule\nthat “the burdens of producing evidence and of persuasion\nwith regard to any given issue are both generally allocated\nto the same party.” 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence\n§337, p. 415 (5th ed. 1999). And, in the context of the\ndefense of duress, it accords with the doctrine that “where\nthe facts with regard to an issue lie peculiarly in the\nknowledge of a party, that party has the burden of proving\nthe issue.” Id., at 413. Although she claims that the\ncommon-law rule placing the burden on a defendant to\nprove the existence of duress “was the product of flawed\nreasoning,” petitioner accepts that this was the general\nrule, at least until this Court’s decision in Davis. Brief for\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioner 18. According to petitioner, however, Davis\ninitiated a revolution that overthrew the old common-law\nrule and established her proposed rule in its place.\n   Davis itself, however, does not support petitioner’s\nposition. In that case, we reviewed a defendant’s convic\ntion for having committed murder “feloniously, wilfully,\nand of his malice aforethought.” 160 U. S., at 474. It was\nundisputed that the prosecution’s evidence “if alone con\nsidered, made it the duty of the jury to return a verdict of\nguilty of the crime charged”; the defendant, however,\nadduced evidence at trial tending to show that he did not\nhave the mental capacity to form the requisite intent. Id.,\nat 475. At issue before the Court was the correctness of\nthe trial judge’s instruction to the jury that the law “ ‘pre\nsumes every man is sane, and the burden of showing it is\nnot true is upon the party who asserts it.’ ” Id., at 476.\nUnder this instruction, “if the evidence was in equilibrio\nas to the accused being sane, that is, capable of compre\nhending the nature and effect of his acts, he was to be\ntreated just as he would be if there were no defence of\ninsanity or if there was an entire absence of proof that he\nwas insane.” Id., at 479.\n   In reversing the defendant’s conviction, we found our\nselves “unable to assent to the doctrine that in a prosecu\ntion for murder . . . it is the duty of the jury to convict\nwhere the evidence is equally balanced on the issue as to\nthe sanity of the accused at the time of the killing.” Id., at\n484 (emphasis added). Instead, we concluded that this\ndefendant was “entitled to an acquittal of the specific\ncrime charged if upon all the evidence there is reasonable\ndoubt whether he was capable in law of committing the\ncrime.” Ibid. (emphasis added). Our opinion focused on\nthe “definition of murder,” explaining that “it is of the very\nessence of that heinous crime that it be committed by a\nperson of ‘sound memory and discretion,’ and with ‘malice\naforethought.’ ” Ibid. (citations omitted). Reviewing “the\n8                DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nadjudged cases” and “elementary treatises upon criminal\nlaw,” we found that “[a]ll admit that the crime of murder\nnecessarily involves the possession by the accused of such\nmental capacity as will render him criminally responsible\nfor his acts.” Id., at 485. Thus, when we ultimately found\nthat the burden of proving the accused’s sanity rested on\nthe Government, our holding rested on the conclusion\nthat:\n     “[Davis’] guilt cannot be said to have been proved be\n    yond a reasonable doubt—his will and his acts cannot\n    be held to have joined in perpetrating the murder\n    charged—if the jury, upon all the evidence, have a\n    reasonable doubt whether he was legally capable of\n    committing crime, or (which is the same thing)\n    whether he wilfully, deliberately, unlawfully, and of\n    malice aforethought took the life of the deceased. As\n    the crime of murder involves sufficient capacity to dis\n    tinguish between right and wrong, the legal interpre\n    tation of every verdict of guilty as charged is that the\n    jury believed from all the evidence beyond a reason\n    able doubt that the accused was guilty, and was there\n    fore responsible, criminally, for his acts. How then\n    upon principle or consistently with humanity can a\n    verdict of guilty be properly returned, if the jury en\n    tertain a reasonable doubt as to the existence of a fact\n    which is essential to guilt, namely, the capacity in law\n    of the accused to commit that crime?” Id., at 488.\n   Our opinion in Davis, then, interpreted a defendant’s\nsanity to controvert the necessary mens rea for the crime\nof murder committed “feloniously, wilfully, and of his mal\nice aforethought,” id., at 474, as “[o]ne who takes human\nlife cannot be said to be actuated by malice aforethought,\nor to have deliberately intended to take life, or to have ‘a\nwicked, depraved, and malignant heart,’ . . . unless at the\n                  Cite as: 548 U.

We\nrequired the Government to prove the defendant’s sanity\nbeyond a reasonable doubt because the evidence that\ntended to prove insanity also tended to disprove an essential\nelement of the offense charged. See Davis v. United States,\n165 U. S. 373, 378 (1897) (“[T]he fact of sanity, as any\nother essential fact in the case, must be established to the\nsatisfaction of the jury beyond a reasonable doubt” (em\nphasis added)). Whether or not this reasoning correctly\ntreated insanity as negating the mens rea for murder as\ndefined in the statute at issue, cf., n. 4, supra, it does not\nhelp petitioner: The evidence of duress she adduced at trial\ndoes not contradict or tend to disprove any element of the\nstatutory offenses that she committed.\n   Nor does the proposition for which Davis has come to\nstand help petitioner’s cause. Although written more\nnarrowly in the context of a prosecution for the crime of\nmurder, Davis was later interpreted to establish a general\n“rule for federal prosecutions . . . that an accused is ‘enti\ntled to an acquittal of the specific crime charged if upon all\nthe evidence there is reasonable doubt whether he was\ncapable in law of committing crime.’ ” Leland v. Oregon,\n343 U. S. 790, 797 (1952) (quoting Davis, 160 U. S., at\n484); see also Lynch v. Overholser, 369 U. S. 705, 713\n(1962) (explaining that the Davis rule applied in all fed\neral courts). After Davis, if a federal defendant introduced\nsufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt as to his\nsanity, it was sufficient to create a question for the jury on\nwhich the Government bore the ultimate burden of per\nsuasion beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., Hall v.\nUnited States, 295 F. 2d 26, 28 (CA4 1961); Holloway v.\nUnited States, 148 F. 2d 665, 666 (CADC 1945); Post v.\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10 (CA5 1905).\n   In apparent recognition of the fact that Davis relied on\nthe heightened mens rea applicable to the particular stat\n10               DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nute at issue, we held in Leland that this rule was not\nconstitutionally mandated, 343 U. S., at 797, and Con\ngress overruled it by statute in 1984, requiring a defen\ndant to prove his insanity by clear and convincing evi\ndence, 98 Stat. 2057, codified at 18 U. S. C. §17(b).\nMoreover, Congress has treated the defense of insanity\ndifferently from that of duress not only by codifying it but\nby requiring defendants who intend to rely on an insanity\ndefense to provide advance notice to the Government. See\nFed. Rule Crim. Proc. 12.2(a). Thus, even if the rule aris\ning from Davis may have once been relevant to an evalua\ntion of other affirmative defenses, Congress’ differential\ntreatment of the insanity defense and its rejection of the\nDavis rule are inconsistent with petitioner’s invitation to\nfollow Davis’ lead in this case.\n   Indeed, petitioner’s reliance on Davis ignores the fact\nthat federal crimes “are solely creatures of statute,” Lipa\nrota, 471 U. S., at 424, and therefore that we are required\nto effectuate the duress defense as Congress “may have\ncontemplated” it in the context of these specific offenses,\nUnited States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Cooperative,\n532 U. S. 483, 491, n. 3 (2001) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also id., at 499 (STEVENS, J., concurring in\njudgment) (explaining that Court was addressing whether\nthe statute at issue foreclosed a necessity defense to spe\ncific charges brought under the statute); Bailey, 444 U. S.,\nat 410 (“We need not speculate now, however, on the\nprecise contours of whatever defenses of duress or neces\nsity are available against charges brought under [18\nU. S. C.] §751(a)”). The offenses at issue in this case were\ncreated by statute in 1968, when Congress enacted the\nOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act (hereinafter\nSafe Streets Act or Act). See 82 Stat. 197. There is no\nevidence in the Act’s structure or history that Congress\nactually considered the question of how the duress defense\nshould work in this context, and there is no suggestion\n                     Cite as: 548 U.

Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Cooperative,\n532 U. S., at 491. Assuming that a defense of duress is\navailable to the statutory crimes at issue,7 then, we must\ndetermine what that defense would look like as Congress\n“may have contemplated” it.\n  As discussed above, the common law long required the\ndefendant to bear the burden of proving the existence of\nduress. Similarly, even where Congress has enacted an\naffirmative defense in the proviso of a statute, the “settled\nrule in this jurisdiction [is] that an indictment or other\npleading . . . need not negative the matter of an exception\nmade by a proviso or other distinct clause . . . and that it is\nincumbent on one who relies on such an exception to set it\nup and establish it.” McKelvey v. United States, 260 U. S.\n353, 357 (1922); see also United States v. Dickson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86169\"><a href=\"/opinion/86169/united-states-v-dickson/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 165 (1841) (calling this “the general rule of law which\nhas always prevailed, and become consecrated almost as a\nmaxim in the interpretation of statutes”). Even though the\nSafe Streets Act does not mention the defense of duress, we\ncan safely assume that the 1968 Congress was familiar with\nboth the long-established common-law rule8 and the rule\n——————\n  6 While Congress’ findings in support of the Safe Streets Act show\n\nthat Congress was concerned because “the ease with which any person\ncan acquire firearms . . . is a significant factor in the prevalence of\nlawlessness and violent crime in the United States,” §901(a)(2), 82 Stat.\n225, it would be unrealistic to read this concern with the proliferation\nof firearm-based violent crime as implicitly doing away with a defense\nas strongly rooted in history as the duress defense, see, e.g., 4 W.\nBlackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 30 (1769).\n  7 We have previously made this assumption when addressing com\n\nmon-law affirmative defenses, see United States v. Oakland Cannabis\nBuyers’ Cooperative, 532 U. S. 483, 491 (2001); Bailey, 444 U. S., at 410,\nand the parties give us no reason to question it here.\n  8 Indeed, when a congressional committee did consider codifying the\n\nduress defense, it would have had the courts determine the defense\n“according to the principles of the common law as they may be inter\npreted in the light of reason and experience.” S. 1437, 95th Cong., 2d\n12                    DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\napplied in McKelvey and that it would have expected federal\ncourts to apply a similar approach to any affirmative de\nfense that might be asserted as a justification or excuse for\nviolating the new law.9\n   This conclusion is surely more reasonable than peti\ntioner’s hypothesis that Davis dramatically upset a well-\nsettled rule of law. Petitioner cites only one federal case\ndecided before 1968 for the proposition that it has been\nwell established in federal law that the Government bears\nthe burden of disproving duress beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. But that case involved a defendant’s claim that he\n“lacked the specific intent to defraud required by the\nstatute for the reason that he committed the offense under\nduress and coercion.” Johnson v. United States, 291 F. 2d\n150, 152 (CA8 1961). Thus, when the Court of Appeals\nexplained that “there is no burden upon the defendant to\nprove his defense of coercion,” id., at 155, that statement\nis best understood in context as a corollary to the by-then\nunremarkable proposition that “the burden of proof rests\nupon the Government to prove the defendant’s guilt be\nyond a reasonable doubt,” ibid. Properly understood,\nJohnson provides petitioner little help in her uphill strug\ngle to prove that a dramatic shift in the federal common-\nlaw rule occurred between Davis and the enactment of the\nSafe Streets Act in 1968.\n   Indeed, for us to be able to accept petitioner’s proposi\ntion, we would need to find an overwhelming consensus\namong federal courts that it is the Government’s burden to\ndisprove the existence of duress beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. The existence today of disagreement among the\n——————\nSess., §501 (1978).\n  9 Duress, like the defense at issue in McKelvey, is an excuse that allows\n\nan exception from liability. See, e.g., 2 LaFave §9.7, at 72 (“The ration\nale of the defense of duress is that the defendant ought to be excused\nwhen he ‘is the victim of a threat that a person of reasonable moral\nstrength could not fairly be expected to resist’ ”).\n                      Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                     13\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nFederal Courts of Appeals on this issue, however—the\nvery disagreement that caused us to grant certiorari in\nthis case, see n. 1, supra—demonstrates that no such\nconsensus has ever existed. See also post, at 6–8 (BREYER,\nJ., dissenting) (discussing differences in treatment of the\nduress defense by the various Courts of Appeals). Also\nundermining petitioner’s argument is the fact that, in\n1970, the National Commission on Reform of Federal\nCriminal Laws proposed that a defendant prove the exis\ntence of duress by a preponderance of the evidence. See 1\nWorking Papers 278. Moreover, while there seem to be\nfew, if any, post-Davis, pre-1968 cases placing the burden\non a defendant to prove the existence of duress,10 or even\ndiscussing the issue in any way, this lack of evidence does\nnot help petitioner. The long-established common-law\nrule is that the burden of proving duress rests on the\ndefendant. Petitioner hypothesizes that Davis fomented a\nrevolution upsetting this rule. If this were true, one would\nexpect to find cases discussing the matter. But no such\ncases exist.\n   It is for a similar reason that we give no weight to the\npublication of the Model Penal Code in 1962. As petitioner\nnotes, the Code would place the burden on the government\nto disprove the existence of duress beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. See Model Penal Code §1.12, 10A U. L. A. 88\n(2001) (hereinafter Model Penal Code or Code) (stating\nthat each element of an offense must be proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt); §1.13(9)(c), at 91 (defining as an ele\n——————\n  10 In D’Aquino v. United States, 192 F. 2d 338, 358, n. 11 (CA9 1951), the\ntrial court instructed the jury that it would be warranted in acquitting the\ndefendant on the basis that she acted under duress “ ‘if you believe from\nthe evidence that the defendant committed these acts that the Govern\nment alleges . . . under a well grounded apprehension of immediate death\nor serious bodily injury . . . .’ ” This instruction did not require the Gov\nernment to disprove duress beyond a reasonable doubt, and it seemingly\nplaced the burden on the defendant to prove the existence of duress.\n14                DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment anything that negatives an excuse for the conduct at\nissue); §2.09, at 131–132 (establishing affirmative defense\nof duress). Petitioner argues that the Code reflects “well\nestablished” federal law as it existed at the time. Brief for\nPetitioner 25. But, as discussed above, no such consensus\nexisted when Congress passed the Safe Streets Act in\n1968. And even if we assume Congress’ familiarity with\nthe Code and the rule it would establish, there is no evi\ndence that Congress endorsed the Code’s views or incorpo\nrated them into the Safe Streets Act.\n  In fact, the Act itself provides evidence to the contrary.\nDespite the Code’s careful delineation of mental states, see\nModel Penal Code §2.02, 10A U. L. A., at 94–95, the Safe\nStreets Act attached no explicit mens rea requirement to\nthe crime of receiving a firearm while under indictment,\n§924(a), 82 Stat. 233 (“Whoever violates any provision of\nthis chapter . . . shall be fined not more than $5,000 or\nimprisoned not more than five years, or both”). And when\nCongress amended the Act to impose a mens rea require\nment, it punished people who “willfully” violate the stat\nute, see 100 Stat. 456, a mental state that has not been\nembraced by the Code, see Model Penal Code §2.02(2), 10A\nU. L. A., at 94–95 (defining “purposely,” “knowingly,”\n“recklessly,” and “negligently”); Explanatory Note, p. 97\n(“Though the term ‘wilfully’ is not used in the definitions\nof crimes contained in the Code, its currency and its exis\ntence in offenses outside the criminal code suggest the\ndesirability of clarification”). Had Congress intended to\nadopt the Code’s structure when it enacted or amended\nthe Safe Streets Act, one would expect the Act’s form and\nlanguage to adhere much more closely to that used by the\nCode. It does not, and, for that reason, we cannot rely on\nthe Model Penal Code to provide evidence as to how Con\ngress would have wanted us to effectuate the duress de\nfense in this context.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

The question here is how to\nproceed when Congress has enacted a criminal statute, the\nOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 82\nStat. 197 et seq. (hereinafter Safe Streets Act), without\nexplicit instructions regarding the duress defense or its\nburden of proof. See ante, at 10.\n  When issues of congressional intent with respect to the\nnature, extent, and definition of federal crimes arise, we\nassume Congress acted against certain background under\nstandings set forth in judicial decisions in the Anglo-\nAmerican legal tradition. See United States v. Bailey, 444\nU. S. 394, 415, n. 11 (1980). Those decisions, in turn, con\nsult sources such as legal treatises and the American\nLegal Institute’s Model Penal Code. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Jimenez Recio, 537 U. S. 270, 275–276 (2003);\nSalinas v. United States, 522 U. S. 52, 64–65 (1997). All of\nthese sources rely upon the insight gained over time as the\nlegal process continues. Absent some contrary indication\nin the statute, we can assume that Congress would not\nwant to foreclose the courts from consulting these newer\n2                 DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nsources and considering innovative arguments in resolving\nissues not confronted in the statute and not within the\nlikely purview of Congress when it enacted the criminal\nprohibition applicable in the particular case.\n   While the Court looks to the state of the law at the time\nthe statute was enacted, see ante, at 12, the better reading\nof the Court’s opinion is that isolated authorities or writ\nings do not control unless they were indicative of guiding\nprinciples upon which Congress likely would have relied.\nOtherwise, it seems altogether a fiction to attribute to\nCongress any intent one way or the other in assigning the\nburden of proof. It seems unlikely, moreover, that Congress\nwould have wanted the burden of proof for duress to vary\nfrom statute to statute depending upon the date of enact\nment. Consistent with these propositions, the Court looks\nnot only to our precedents and common-law traditions, but\nalso to the treatment of the insanity defense in a 1984\nstatute and a proposal of the National Commission on\nReform of Federal Criminal Laws, even though they both\npostdated the passage of the Safe Streets Act. See ante, at\n10, 13.\n   As there is no reason to suppose that Congress wanted\nto depart from the traditional principles for allocating the\nburden of proof, the proper approach is simply to apply\nthese principles to the context of duress. See, e.g.,\nSchaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 6–\n7) (where the plain text of the statute is “silent on the\nallocation of the burden of persuasion,” we proceed to\nconsider the “ordinary default rule” and its exceptions).\nThe facts needed to prove or disprove the defense “lie\npeculiarly in the knowledge of” the defendant. 2 K.

There is good reason, then, to\nmaintain the usual rule of placing the burden of produc\ntion and persuasion together on the party raising the\nissue. See 2 Broun, supra, §337; ante, at 6.

See\n4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England\n30 (1769). When Congress began to enact federal criminal\nstatutes, it presumptively intended for those offenses to be\nsubject to this defense. Moreover, Congress presumptively\nintended for the burdens of production and persuasion to\nbe placed, as they were at common law, on the defendant.\nAlthough Congress is certainly free to alter this pattern\nand place one or both burdens on the prosecution, either\nfor all or selected federal crimes, Congress has not done so\nbut instead has continued to revise the federal criminal\nlaws and to create new federal crimes without addressing\nthe issue of duress. Under these circumstances, I believe\nthat the burdens remain where they were when Congress\nbegan enacting federal criminal statutes.\n   I do not assume that Congress makes a new, implicit\njudgment about the allocation of these burdens whenever\nit creates a new federal crime or, for that matter, when\never it substantially revises an existing criminal statute.\n2                DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nIt is unrealistic to assume that on every such occasion\nCongress surveys the allocation of the burdens of proof on\nduress under the existing federal case law and under the\nlaw of the States and tacitly adopts whatever the pre\ndominant position happens to be at the time. Such a\nmethodology would create serious problems for the district\ncourts and the courts of appeals when they are required to\ndecide where the burden of persuasion should be allocated\nfor federal crimes enacted on different dates. If the alloca\ntion differed for different offenses, there might be federal\ncriminal cases in which the trial judge would be forced to\ninstruct the jury that the defendant bears the burden of\npersuasion on this defense for some of the offenses\ncharged in the indictment and that the prosecution bears\nthe burden on others.\n   I would also not assume, as JUSTICE BREYER does, see\npost, at 2–3, that Congress has implicitly delegated to the\nfederal courts the task of deciding in the manner of a\ncommon-law court where the burden of persuasion should\nbe allocated. The allocation of this burden is a debatable\npolicy question with an important empirical component.\nIn the absence of specific direction from Congress, cf. Fed.\nRule Evid. 501, I would not assume that Congress has\nconferred this authority on the Judiciary.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

Historically, that defense\n“excuse[d] criminal conduct” if (1) a “threat of imminent\ndeath or serious bodily injury” led the defendant to commit\nthe crime, (2) the defendant had no reasonable, legal\nalternative to breaking the law, and (3) the defendant was\nnot responsible for creating the threat. United States v.\nBailey, 444 U. S. 394, 409–410 (1980); see also 2 W. LaFave,\nSubstantive Criminal Law §9.7(b), pp. 74–82 (2003) (here\ninafter LaFave); ante, at 2, n. 1 (opinion of the Court). The\nCourt decides today in respect to federal crimes that the\ndefense must bear the burden of both producing evidence\nof duress and persuading the jury. I agree with the major\nity that the burden of production lies on the defendant,\nthat here the burden of persuasion issue is not constitu\ntional, and that Congress may allocate that burden as it\nsees fit. But I also believe that, in the absence of any\nindication of a different congressional intent, the burden of\npersuading the jury beyond a reasonable doubt should lie\nwhere such burdens normally lie in criminal cases, upon\nthe prosecution.\n                          I\n  My disagreement with the majority in part reflects my\n2                 DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndifferent view about how we should determine the rele\nvant congressional intent. Where Congress speaks about\nburdens of proof, we must, of course, follow what it says.\nBut suppose, as is normally the case, that the relevant\nfederal statute is silent? The majority proceeds on the\nassumption that Congress wished courts to fill the gap by\nexamining judicial practice at the time that Congress\nenacted the particular criminal statute in question. Ante,\nat 10–14 (opinion of the Court). I would not follow that\napproach.\n   To believe Congress intended the placement of such\nburdens to vary from statute to statute and time to time is\nboth unrealistic and risks unnecessary complexity, jury\nconfusion, and unfairness. It is unrealistic because the\nsilence could well mean only that Congress did not specifi\ncally consider the “burden of persuasion” in respect to a\nduress defense. It simply did not think about that secon\ndary matter. Had it done so, would Congress have wanted\ncourts to freeze current practice statute-by-statute?\nWould it have wanted to impose different burden-of-proof\nrequirements where claims of duress are identical, where\nstatutes are similar, where the only relevant difference is\nthe time of enactment? Why? Indeed, individual in\nstances of criminal conduct often violate several statutes.\nIn a trial for those violations, is the judge to instruct the\njury to apply different standards of proof to a duress de\nfense depending upon when Congress enacted the particu\nlar statute in question? What if in this very case the\ndefendant’s boyfriend had given her drug money and\ninsisted (under threat of death) not only that she use some\nof the money to buy him a gun, but that she launder the\nrest? See 18 U. S. C. §1956 (2000 ed. and Supp. II); see\ninfra, at 6–7.\n   I would assume instead that Congress’ silence typically\nmeans that Congress expected the courts to develop bur\nden rules governing affirmative defenses as they have\n                 Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndone in the past, by beginning with the common law and\ntaking full account of the subsequent need for that law to\nevolve through judicial practice informed by reason and\nexperience. See Davis v. United States, 160 U. S. 469\n(1895); McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332, 341\n(1943); ante, at 11, n. 8 (opinion of the Court) (proposed\ngeneral revision of the federal criminal code would have\ninstructed courts to determine the contours of affirmative\ndefenses “ ‘according to the principles of the common law\nas they may be interpreted in the light of reason and\nexperience’ ”); 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence §2486, p. 291 (J.\nChadbourn rev. ed. 1981) (allocation of the burdens of\nproof present courts with questions “of policy and fairness\nbased on experience in the different situations”). That\napproach would produce uniform federal practice across\ndifferent affirmative defenses, as well as across statutes\npassed at different points in time.\n                             II\n  My approach leads me to conclude that in federal crimi\nnal cases, the prosecution should bear the duress defense\nburden of persuasion. The issue is a close one. In Black-\nstone’s time the accused bore the burden of proof for all\naffirmative defenses. See 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries\n*201; Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 201–202\n(1977). And 20th-century experts have taken different\npositions on the matter. The Model Penal Code, for exam\nple, recommends placing the burden of persuasion on the\nprosecution.     ALI, Model Penal Code §1.12, p. 16,\n§1.13(9)(c), p. 18, §2.09, pp. 37–38 (1985). The Brown\nCommission recommends placing it upon the defendant.\nNational Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal\nLaws, 1 Working Papers 278 (1970). And the proposed\nrevision of the federal criminal code, agnostically, would\nhave turned the matter over to the courts for decision.\nS. 1722, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., §501 (1979). Moreover,\n4                 DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthere is a practical argument that favors the Govern\nment’s position here, namely that defendants should bear\nthe burden of persuasion because defendants often have\nsuperior access to the relevant proof.\n  Nonetheless, several factors favor placing the burden on\nthe prosecution. For one thing, in certain respects the\nquestion of duress resembles that of mens rea, an issue\nthat is always for the prosecution to prove beyond a rea\nsonable doubt. See In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364\n(1970); Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S. 228, 234 (1987). The\nquestions are not the same. The defendant’s criminal\nactivity here was voluntary; no external principle, such as\nthe wind, propelled her when she acted. The Nico\nmachean Ethics of Aristotle, p. 54 (R. W. Browne transl.\n1865). Moreover, her actions were intentional. Whether\nshe wanted to buy the guns or not, and whether she\nwanted to lie while doing so or not, she decided to do these\nthings and knew that she was doing them. Indeed, her\naction was willful in the sense that she knew that to do\nthem was to break the law. Ante, at 3–4 (opinion of the\nCourt); see also Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U. S. 135,\n136–137 (1994).\n  Nonetheless, where a defendant acts under duress, she\nlacks any semblance of a meaningful choice. In that sense\nher choice is not free. As Blackstone wrote, the criminal\nlaw punishes “abuse[s] of th[e] free will”; hence “it is\nhighly just and equitable that a man should be excused for\nthose acts, which are done through unavoidable force and\ncompulsion.” 4 Commentaries *27. And it is in this “force\nand compulsion,” acting upon the will, that the resem\nblance to lack of mens rea lies. Cf. Austin, Ifs and Cans, in\nProceedings of the British Academy 123–124 (1956) (not\ning difference between choosing to do something where one\nhas the opportunity and ability to do otherwise and choos\ning to do something where one lacks any such opportunity\nor ability).

That case, read in light of Leland v.\nOregon, 343 U. S. 790, 797 (1952), suggests that, even if\ninsanity does not always show the absence of mens rea, it\ndoes show the absence of a “‘vicious will.’ ” Davis, supra, at\n484 (citing Blackstone; emphasis added).\n   For another thing, federal courts (as a matter of statu\ntory construction or supervisory power) have imposed the\nfederal-crime burden of persuasion upon the prosecution\nin respect to self-defense, insanity, and entrapment, which\nresemble the duress defense in certain relevant ways. In\nrespect to both duress and self-defense, for example, the\ndefendant’s illegal act is voluntary, indeed, intentional;\nbut the circumstances deprive the defendant of any mean\ningful ability or opportunity to act otherwise, depriving\nthe defendant of a choice that is free. Insanity, as I said,\nmay involve circumstances that resemble, but are not\nidentical to, a lack of mens rea. And entrapment requires\nthe prosecution to prove that the defendant was “predis\nposed” to commit the crime—a matter sometimes best\nknown to the defendant.\n   As to self-defense, see First Circuit Pattern Criminal\nJury Instructions §5.04 (1998); United States v. Thomas,\n34 F. 3d 44, 47 (CA2 1994); Government of Virgin Islands\nv. Smith, 949 F. 2d 677, 680 (CA3 1991); United States v.\nHarris, Nos. 95–5637, 95–5638, 1996 U. S.

S., at 486; Leland,\nsupra, at 797 (making clear that Davis determined burden\nallocations as a matter of federal, but not constitutional,\nlaw); but see 18 U. S. C. §17(b) (overruling this default\nrule to place the burden on the defendant by clear and\nconvincing evidence). As to entrapment, see Jacobson v.\nUnited States, 503 U. S. 540, 554 (1992) (reversing the\njudgment affirming the conviction because “the prosecu\ntion failed, as a matter of law, to adduce evidence to sup\nport the jury verdict that petitioner was predisposed,\nindependent of the Government’s acts and beyond a rea\nsonable doubt” to commit the crime). See also Patterson,\n432 U. S., at 202 (noting that Davis “had wide impact on\nthe practice in the federal courts with respect to the bur\nden of proving various affirmative defenses”); Patterson,\nsupra, at 231 (Powell, J., dissenting) (“[S]ince this Court’s\ndecision in Davis . . . federal prosecutors have borne the\nburden of persuasion with respect to factors like insanity,\nself-defense, and malice or provocation, once the defendant\nhas carried this burden of production”).\n   Further, most federal courts, in respect to most federal\ncrimes, have imposed the burden of persuasion in respect\nto the duress defense upon the Government, following\nJohnson v. United States, 291 F. 2d 150, 155 (CA8 1961),\nand authorities such as E. Devitt & C. Blackmar, Federal\nJury Practice and Instructions §13.14, p. 293 (2d ed.\n1970), and the Federal Judicial Center Pattern Criminal\nJury Instructions §56 (1988). By the mid-1990’s, seven\ncircuits had squarely placed the burden of persuasion\nupon the prosecution; one Circuit (the Fifth) placed the\nburden on the defendant; and four (the Third, Fourth,\nEleventh, and District of Columbia) did not, as far as I can\ntell, have a definitive practice. Compare United States v.\nArthurs, 73 F. 3d 444, 448 (CA1 1996); United States v.\nMitchell, 725 F. 2d 832, 836 (CA2 1983); United States v.\nCampbell, 675 F. 2d 815, 821 (CA6 1982); United States v.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

Petitioner adds, without\ncontradiction, that the States allocate the burden similarly\nby a ratio of 2 to 1. Brief for Petitioner 32–34; Brief for\nUnited States 38, n. 30.\n  Beginning in 1991, the matter became more complicated\nbecause the Ninth Circuit began to require the defendant\nto bear the burden of proving duress in certain circum\nstances. United States v. Dominguez-Mestas, 929 F. 2d\n1379, 1382, 1384 (1991) (per curiam). And a few years\nlater the Third, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits followed suit\nin cases concerning a closely related justification defense.\nSee United States v. Dodd, 225 F. 3d 340, 347–350 (CA3\n2000); United States v. Brown, 367 F. 3d 549, 555–556\n(CA6 2004); United States v. Deleveaux, 205 F. 3d 1292,\n1298-1300 (CA11 2000); Eleventh Circuit Pattern Crimi\nnal Jury Instructions §16 (2003). But see Sixth Circuit\nPattern Criminal Jury Instructions §6.05 (2005) (stating\nthat the burden of proof issue for duress is undecided in\nthat Circuit).\n  These latter cases, however, put the burden on the\ndefendant only where the criminal statute narrows its\nmens rea requirement, i.e., the burden is the defendant’s\nwhere the statute requires that the defendant act with\n“knowledge” but not, suggest these courts, where the\n8                 DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nstatute requires that the defendant act “willfully,” “inten\ntionally,” or “voluntarily.” See, e.g., Dominguez-Mestas,\nsupra, at 1382, 1384; United States v. Meraz-Solomon, 3\nF. 3d 298, 300 (CA9 1993); Ninth Circuit Pattern Criminal\nJury Instructions §§6.5, 6.6 (2003); but see United States\nv. Fei Lin, 139 F. 3d 1303, 1307–1308 (CA9 1998). See\nalso Eleventh Circuit Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions\n§16 (2003); United States v. Diaz, 285 F. 3d 92, 97 (CA1\n2002) (indicating that this bifurcated rule might be appro\npriate, but noting Circuit precedent to the contrary).\nSimilarly, the Tenth Circuit placed the burden of proving\nduress upon the defendant in “strict liability” cases where\nmens rea is not an element of the crime at all. United\nStates v. Unser, 165 F. 3d 755, 763–765 (CA10 1999).\n   The apparent upshot is that four Circuits now place the\nburden of persuasion on the prosecution across the board;\none places the burden on the prosecution if the statute\nrequires mens rea but not otherwise; and four have held or\nsuggested that the burden should be on the prosecution if\nthe statute requires an intentional or willful state of mind,\nbut not if the statute requires only knowledge. While the\nCircuits are divided, apparently only one (the Fifth) agrees\nwith the position taken by the Court today.\n   Further, while I concede the logic of the Government’s\npractical argument—that defendants have superior access\nto the evidence—I remain uncertain of the argument’s\nstrength. After all, “[i]n every criminal case the defendant\nhas at least an equal familiarity with the facts and in most\na greater familiarity with them than the prosecution.” Tot\nv. United States, 319 U. S. 463, 469 (1943). And the strict\ncontours of the duress defense, as well as the defendant’s\nburden of production, already substantially narrow the\ncircumstances under which the defense may be used. A\ndefendant may find it difficult, for example, to show duress\nwhere the relevant conduct took place too long before the\ncriminal act. Cf. ante, at 2 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). That is\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)              9\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nbecause the defendant must show that he had no alternative\nto breaking the law. Supra, at 1. And that will be the more\ndifficult to show the more remote the threat. See also La-\nFave, § 9.7, p. 77-79 (duress generally requires an “immedi\nate” or “imminent” threat, that the defendant “take advan\ntage of a reasonable opportunity to escape,” and that the\ndefendant “terminate his conduct ‘as soon as the claimed\nduress . . . had lost its coercive force’”). More important, the\nneed to prove mens rea can easily present precisely the same\npractical difficulties of proof for the prosecutor. Suppose for\nexample the defendant claims that an old lady told him that\nthe white powder he transported across the border was\nmedicine for her dying son. Cf. United States v. Mares, 441\nF. 3d 1152 (CA10 2006). See also Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421\nU. S., at 702 (requiring the government to prove an absence\nof passion in a murder conviction imposes “no unique hard\nship on the prosecution”).\n   It is particularly difficult to see a practical distinction\nbetween this affirmative defense and, say, self-defense.\nThe Government says that the prosecution may “be unable\nto call the witness most likely to have information bearing\non the point,” namely, the defendant. Brief for United\nStates 21. But what is the difference in this respect be\ntween the defendant here, who says her boyfriend threat\nened to kill her, and a battered woman who says that she\nkilled her husband in self-defense, where the husband’s\nevidence is certainly unavailable? See also Jacobson, 503\nU. S. 540 (entrapment; need to prove “propensity”). Re\ngardless, unless the defendant testifies, it could prove\ndifficult to satisfy the defendant’s burden of production; and,\nof course, once the defendant testifies, cross-examination is\npossible.\n   In a word, I cannot evaluate the claim of practicality\nwithout somewhat more systematic evidence of the exis\ntence of a problem, say, in those Circuits that for many\nyears have imposed the burden on the prosecutor. And, of\n10               DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncourse, if I am wrong about the Government’s practical\nneed (and were my views to prevail), the Government\nwould remain free to ask Congress to reallocate the\nburden.\n   Finally, there is a virtue in uniformity, in treating the\nfederal statutory burden of persuasion similarly in respect\nto actus reus, mens rea, mistake, self-defense, entrapment,\nand duress. The Second Circuit, when imposing the bur\nden of persuasion for duress on the prosecution, wrote that\ndifferences in this respect create “a grave possibility of\njuror confusion.” United States v. Mitchell, 725 F. 2d 832,\n836 (1983) (Newman, J., joined by Feinberg, C. J., and\nFriendly, J.). They risk unfairness as well.\n   For these reasons I believe that, in the absence of an\nindication of congressional intent to the contrary, federal\ncriminal law should place the burden of persuasion in\nrespect to the duress defense upon the prosecution, which,\nas is now common in respect to many affirmative defenses,\nit must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 05–7053. Argued April 25, 2006—Decided June 22, 2006\nPetitioner was charged with receiving a firearm while under indictment\n  in violation of 18 U. S. C. §922(n) and with making false statements\n  in connection with the acquisition of a firearm in violation of\n  §922(a)(6). She admitted at trial that she knew she was under in\n  dictment when she purchased the firearms and knew that doing so\n  was a crime, but claimed that she was acting under duress because\n  her boyfriend had threatened to harm her and her daughters if she\n  did not buy the guns for him. Bound by Fifth Circuit precedent, the\n  District Court declined her request for a jury instruction placing\n  upon the Government the burden to disprove, beyond a reasonable\n  doubt, her duress defense. Instead, the jury was instructed that peti\n  tioner had the burden to establish her defense by a preponderance of\n  the evidence. She was convicted, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. The jury instructions did not run afoul of the Due Process\n Clause. The crimes of conviction require that petitioner have acted\n “knowingly,” §922(a)(6)—which “merely requires proof of knowledge\n of the facts that constitute the offense,” Bryan v. United States, 524\n U. S. 184, 193—or “willfully,” §924(a)(1)(D)—which requires acting\n “with knowledge that [the] conduct was unlawful,” ibid. Thus, the\n Government bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt\n that petitioner knew that she was making false statements and knew\n that she was breaking the law when she acquired a firearm while\n under indictment. It clearly met its burden when petitioner testified\n to that effect. Petitioner contends that she cannot have formed the\n necessary mens rea because she did not freely choose to commit the\n crimes. However, while the duress defense may excuse conduct that\n would otherwise be punishable, see United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S.\n2                      DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    394, 409–410, the existence of duress normally does not controvert\n    any of the elements of the offense itself. The fact that petitioner’s\n    crimes are statutory offenses with no counterpart in the common law\n    supports this conclusion. The jury instructions were consistent with\n    the requirement that the Government prove the mental states speci\n    fied in §§922(a)(6) and 924(a)(1)(D) and did not run afoul of due proc\n    ess by placing the burden on petitioner to establish duress by a pre\n    ponderance of the evidence. Pp. 3–5.\n       2. Modern common law does not require the Government to bear\n    the burden of disproving petitioner’s duress defense beyond a reason\n    able doubt. The long-established common-law rule, which places the\n    burden of proving that defense on the defendant, was not upset by\n    Davis v. United States, 160 U. S. 469. There, the Court interpreted a\n    defendant’s insanity to controvert the necessary mens rea for a mur\n    der committed “feloniously, wilfully, and of his malice aforethought,”\n    id., at 474, and required the Government to prove the defendant’s\n    sanity beyond a reasonable doubt because the evidence tending to\n    prove insanity also tended to disprove an essential element of the of\n    fense. The duress evidence that petitioner adduced at trial does not\n    contradict or tend to disprove any element of her statutory offenses.\n    She is also not helped by the resulting “Davis rule,” which was not\n    constitutionally mandated, and which Congress overruled by statute,\n    requiring a defendant to prove insanity by clear and convincing evi\n    dence.\n       Petitioner’s reliance on Davis also ignores the fact that federal\n    crimes are “solely creatures of statute,” Liparota v. United States,\n    471 U. S. 419, 424, and thus the Court must effectuate the duress de\n    fense as Congress “may have contemplated” it in the context of these\n    specific offenses, United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Coop\n    erative, 532 U. S. 483, 490, n. 3. The Court can assume that, when\n    passing the relevant 1968 Act, Congress was familiar with the long-\n    established common-law rule and the rule of McKelvey v. United\n    States, 260 U. S. 353, 357—that the one relying on an affirmative de\n    fense must set it up and establish it—and would have expected fed\n    eral courts to apply a similar approach to any affirmative defense or\n    excuse for violating the new law. To accept petitioner’s contrary hy\n    pothesis that Davis dramatically upset well-settled law would require\n    an overwhelming consensus among federal courts placing the burden\n    on the Government, but conflict among the Circuits demonstrates\n    that such consensus has never existed. For a similar reason, no\n    weight is due the 1962 Model Penal Code. There is no evidence that\n    Congress endorsed the Code’s views or incorporated them into the\n    1968 Act.

As a\nresult of these illegal acts, petitioner was indicted and\nconvicted on one count of receiving a firearm while under\nindictment in violation of 18 U. S. C. §922(n) and eight\ncounts of making false statements in connection with the\nacquisition of a firearm in violation of §922(a)(6). At trial,\npetitioner admitted that she knew she was under indict\nment when she made the purchases and that she knew\ndoing so was a crime; her defense was that she acted\nunder duress because her boyfriend threatened to kill her\nor hurt her daughters if she did not buy the guns for him.\n  Petitioner contends that the trial judge’s instructions to\nthe jury erroneously required her to prove duress by a\npreponderance of the evidence instead of requiring the\nGovernment to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she\ndid not act under duress. The Court of Appeals rejected\npetitioner’s contention, 413 F. 3d 520 (CA5 2005); given\n2                     DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncontrary treatment of the issue by other federal courts,1\nwe granted certiorari, 546 U. S. __ (2006).\n                              I\n  At trial, in her request for jury instructions on her\ndefense of duress, petitioner contended that she “should\nhave the burden of production, and then that the Govern\nment should be required to disprove beyond a reasonable\ndoubt the duress.” App. 300. Petitioner admitted that\nthis request was contrary to Fifth Circuit precedent, and\nthe trial court, correctly finding itself bound by Circuit\nprecedent, denied petitioner’s request. Ibid. Instead, the\njudge’s instructions to the jury defined the elements of the\nduress defense2 and stated that petitioner has “the burden\nof proof to establish the defense of duress by a preponder\nance of the evidence.” Id., at 312.\n  Petitioner argues here, as she did in the District Court\nand the Court of Appeals, that federal law requires the\nGovernment to bear the burden of disproving her defense\nbeyond a reasonable doubt and that the trial court’s erro\n\n——————\n    1 Cf.,\n        e.g., United States v.

Simpson, 979 F. 2d 1282, 1287 (CA8 1992).\n  2 There is no federal statute defining the elements of the duress de\n\nfense. We have not specified the elements of the defense, see, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 409–410 (1980), and need not do\nso today. Instead, we presume the accuracy of the District Court’s\ndescription of these elements: (1) The defendant was under an unlawful\nand imminent threat of such a nature as to induce a well-grounded\napprehension of death or serious bodily injury; (2) the defendant had\nnot recklessly or negligently placed herself in a situation in which it\nwas probable that she would be forced to perform the criminal conduct;\n(3) the defendant had no reasonable, legal alternative to violating the\nlaw, that is, a chance both to refuse to perform the criminal act and also\nto avoid the threatened harm; and, (4) that a direct causal relationship\nmay be reasonably anticipated between the criminal act and the avoid\nance of the threatened harm. See App. 312–313; see generally United\nStates v. Harper, 802 F. 2d 115, 118 (CA5 1986).\n                    Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                  3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nneous instruction on this point entitles her to a new trial.\nThere are two aspects to petitioner’s argument in support\nof her proposed instruction that merit separate discussion.\nFirst, petitioner contends that her defense “controverted\nthe mens rea required for conviction” and therefore that\nthe Due Process Clause requires the Government to retain\nthe burden of persuasion on that element. Brief for Peti\ntioner 41. Second, petitioner argues that Fifth Circuit’s\nrule is “contrary to modern common law.” Id., at 14.\n                              II\n   The crimes for which petitioner was convicted require\nthat she have acted “knowingly,” §922(a)(6), or “willfully,”\n§924(a)(1)(D).3 As we have explained, “unless the text of\nthe statute dictates a different result, the term ‘knowingly’\nmerely requires proof of knowledge of the facts that consti\ntute the offense.” Bryan v. United States, 524 U. S. 184,\n193 (1998) (footnote omitted). And the term “willfully” in\n§924(a)(1)(D) requires a defendant to have “acted with\nknowledge that his conduct was unlawful.” Ibid. In this\ncase, then, the Government bore the burden of proving\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner knew she was\nmaking false statements in connection with the acquisi\ntion of firearms and that she knew she was breaking the\nlaw when she acquired a firearm while under indictment.\nSee In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970). Although the\nGovernment may have proved these elements in other\nways, it clearly met its burden when petitioner testified\nthat she knowingly committed certain acts—she put a\nfalse address on the forms she completed to purchase the\nfirearms, falsely claimed that she was the actual buyer of\nthe firearms, and falsely stated that she was not under\nindictment at the time of the purchase—and when she\n——————\n  3 Although §922(n) does not contain a mens rea requirement, the rele\n\nvant sentencing provision, §924(a)(1)(D), requires that a violation be\ncommitted willfully.\n4                     DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntestified that she knew she was breaking the law when, as\nan individual under indictment at the time, she purchased\na firearm. App. 221–222.\n  Petitioner contends, however, that she cannot have\nformed the necessary mens rea for these crimes because\nshe did not freely choose to commit the acts in question.\nBut even if we assume that petitioner’s will was overborne\nby the threats made against her and her daughters, she\nstill knew that she was making false statements and knew\nthat she was breaking the law by buying a firearm. The\nduress defense, like the defense of necessity that we con\nsidered in United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 409–410\n(1980), may excuse conduct that would otherwise be pun\nishable, but the existence of duress normally does not\ncontrovert any of the elements of the offense itself.4 As we\nexplained in Bailey, “[c]riminal liability is normally based\nupon the concurrence of two factors, ‘an evil-meaning\nmind [and] and evil-doing hand . . . .’ ” Id., at 402 (quoting\nMorissette v. United States, 342 U. S. 246, 251 (1952)).\nLike the defense of necessity, the defense of duress does\nnot negate a defendant’s criminal state of mind when the\napplicable offense requires a defendant to have acted\nknowingly or willfully; instead, it allows the defendant to\n“avoid liability . . . because coercive conditions or necessity\nnegates a conclusion of guilt even though the necessary\nmens rea was present.” Bailey, 444 U. S., at 402.5\n——————\n   4 As the Government recognized at oral argument, there may be\n\ncrimes where the nature of the mens rea would require the Government\nto disprove the existence of duress beyond a reasonable doubt. See Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 26–27; see also, e.g., 1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal\nLaw §5.1, p. 333 (2d ed. 2003) (hereinafter LaFave) (explaining that\nsome common-law crimes require that the crime be done “ ‘mali\nciously’ ”); Black’s Law Dictionary 968 (7th ed. 1999) (defining malice as\n“[t]he intent, without justification or excuse, to commit a wrongful act”).\n   5 Professor LaFave has explained the duress defense as follows:\n\n   “The rationale of the defense is not that the defendant, faced with the\nunnerving threat of harm unless he does an act which violates the\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  The fact that petitioner’s crimes are statutory offenses\nthat have no counterpart in the common law also supports\nour conclusion that her duress defense in no way disproves\nan element of those crimes. We have observed that “[t]he\ndefinition of the elements of a criminal offense is en\ntrusted to the legislature, particularly in the case of fed\neral crimes, which are solely creatures of statute.” Lipa\nrota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419, 424 (1985). Here,\nconsistent with the movement away from the traditional\ndichotomy of general versus specific intent and toward a\nmore specifically defined hierarchy of culpable mental\nstates, see Bailey, 444 U. S., at 403–404, Congress defined\nthe crimes at issue to punish defendants who act “know\ningly,” §922(a)(6), or “willfully,” §924(a)(1)(D). It is these\nspecific mental states, rather than some vague “evil mind,”\nBrief for Petitioner 42, or “ ‘criminal’ intent,” Martin v.\nOhio, 480 U. S. 228, 235 (1987), that the Government is\nrequired to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, see Patterson\nv. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 211, n. 12 (1977) (“The appli\ncability of the reasonable-doubt standard, however, has\nalways been dependent on how a State defines the offense\nthat is charged in any given case”). The jury instructions\nin this case were consistent with this requirement and, as\nsuch, did not run afoul of the Due Process Clause when\nthey placed the burden on petitioner to establish the\nexistence of duress by a preponderance of the evidence.\n                         III\n  Having found no constitutional basis for placing upon\nthe Government the burden of disproving petitioner’s\n——————\nliteral language of the criminal law, somehow loses his mental capacity\nto commit the crime in question. Nor is it that the defendant has not\nengaged in a voluntary act. Rather it is that, even though he has done\nthe act the crime requires and has the mental state which the crime\nrequires, his conduct which violates the literal language of the criminal\nlaw is excused . . . .” 2 LaFave §9.7(a), at 72 (footnote omitted).\n6                 DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nduress defense beyond a reasonable doubt, we next ad\ndress petitioner’s argument that the modern common law\nrequires the Government to bear that burden. In making\nthis argument, petitioner recognizes that, until the end of\nthe 19th century, common-law courts generally adhered to\nthe rule that “the proponent of an issue bears the burden\nof persuasion on the factual premises for applying the\nrule.” Fletcher, Two Kinds of Legal Rules: A Comparative\nStudy of Burden-of-Persuasion Practices in Criminal\nCases, 77 Yale L. J. 880, 898 (1967–1968). In petitioner’s\nview, however, two important developments have estab\nlished a contrary common-law rule that now prevails in\nfederal courts: this Court’s decision in Davis v. United\nStates, 160 U. S. 469 (1895), which placed the burden on\nthe Government to prove a defendant’s sanity, and the\npublication of the Model Penal Code in 1962.\n   Although undisputed in this case, it bears repeating\nthat, at common law, the burden of proving “affirmative\ndefenses—indeed, ‘all circumstances . . . of justification,\nexcuse or alleviation’—rested on the defendant.” Patter\nson, 432 U. S., at 202 (quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commen\ntaries *201); see also Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S., at 235;\nMullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 693 (1975). This com\nmon-law rule accords with the general evidentiary rule\nthat “the burdens of producing evidence and of persuasion\nwith regard to any given issue are both generally allocated\nto the same party.” 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence\n§337, p. 415 (5th ed. 1999). And, in the context of the\ndefense of duress, it accords with the doctrine that “where\nthe facts with regard to an issue lie peculiarly in the\nknowledge of a party, that party has the burden of proving\nthe issue.” Id., at 413. Although she claims that the\ncommon-law rule placing the burden on a defendant to\nprove the existence of duress “was the product of flawed\nreasoning,” petitioner accepts that this was the general\nrule, at least until this Court’s decision in Davis. Brief for\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioner 18. According to petitioner, however, Davis\ninitiated a revolution that overthrew the old common-law\nrule and established her proposed rule in its place.\n   Davis itself, however, does not support petitioner’s\nposition. In that case, we reviewed a defendant’s convic\ntion for having committed murder “feloniously, wilfully,\nand of his malice aforethought.” 160 U. S., at 474. It was\nundisputed that the prosecution’s evidence “if alone con\nsidered, made it the duty of the jury to return a verdict of\nguilty of the crime charged”; the defendant, however,\nadduced evidence at trial tending to show that he did not\nhave the mental capacity to form the requisite intent. Id.,\nat 475. At issue before the Court was the correctness of\nthe trial judge’s instruction to the jury that the law “ ‘pre\nsumes every man is sane, and the burden of showing it is\nnot true is upon the party who asserts it.’ ” Id., at 476.\nUnder this instruction, “if the evidence was in equilibrio\nas to the accused being sane, that is, capable of compre\nhending the nature and effect of his acts, he was to be\ntreated just as he would be if there were no defence of\ninsanity or if there was an entire absence of proof that he\nwas insane.” Id., at 479.\n   In reversing the defendant’s conviction, we found our\nselves “unable to assent to the doctrine that in a prosecu\ntion for murder . . . it is the duty of the jury to convict\nwhere the evidence is equally balanced on the issue as to\nthe sanity of the accused at the time of the killing.” Id., at\n484 (emphasis added). Instead, we concluded that this\ndefendant was “entitled to an acquittal of the specific\ncrime charged if upon all the evidence there is reasonable\ndoubt whether he was capable in law of committing the\ncrime.” Ibid. (emphasis added). Our opinion focused on\nthe “definition of murder,” explaining that “it is of the very\nessence of that heinous crime that it be committed by a\nperson of ‘sound memory and discretion,’ and with ‘malice\naforethought.’ ” Ibid. (citations omitted). Reviewing “the\n8                DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nadjudged cases” and “elementary treatises upon criminal\nlaw,” we found that “[a]ll admit that the crime of murder\nnecessarily involves the possession by the accused of such\nmental capacity as will render him criminally responsible\nfor his acts.” Id., at 485. Thus, when we ultimately found\nthat the burden of proving the accused’s sanity rested on\nthe Government, our holding rested on the conclusion\nthat:\n     “[Davis’] guilt cannot be said to have been proved be\n    yond a reasonable doubt—his will and his acts cannot\n    be held to have joined in perpetrating the murder\n    charged—if the jury, upon all the evidence, have a\n    reasonable doubt whether he was legally capable of\n    committing crime, or (which is the same thing)\n    whether he wilfully, deliberately, unlawfully, and of\n    malice aforethought took the life of the deceased. As\n    the crime of murder involves sufficient capacity to dis\n    tinguish between right and wrong, the legal interpre\n    tation of every verdict of guilty as charged is that the\n    jury believed from all the evidence beyond a reason\n    able doubt that the accused was guilty, and was there\n    fore responsible, criminally, for his acts. How then\n    upon principle or consistently with humanity can a\n    verdict of guilty be properly returned, if the jury en\n    tertain a reasonable doubt as to the existence of a fact\n    which is essential to guilt, namely, the capacity in law\n    of the accused to commit that crime?” Id., at 488.\n   Our opinion in Davis, then, interpreted a defendant’s\nsanity to controvert the necessary mens rea for the crime\nof murder committed “feloniously, wilfully, and of his mal\nice aforethought,” id., at 474, as “[o]ne who takes human\nlife cannot be said to be actuated by malice aforethought,\nor to have deliberately intended to take life, or to have ‘a\nwicked, depraved, and malignant heart,’ . . . unless at the\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntime he had sufficient mind to comprehend the criminality\nor the right and wrong of such an act,” id., at 485. We\nrequired the Government to prove the defendant’s sanity\nbeyond a reasonable doubt because the evidence that\ntended to prove insanity also tended to disprove an essential\nelement of the offense charged. See Davis v. United States,\n165 U. S. 373, 378 (1897) (“[T]he fact of sanity, as any\nother essential fact in the case, must be established to the\nsatisfaction of the jury beyond a reasonable doubt” (em\nphasis added)). Whether or not this reasoning correctly\ntreated insanity as negating the mens rea for murder as\ndefined in the statute at issue, cf., n. 4, supra, it does not\nhelp petitioner: The evidence of duress she adduced at trial\ndoes not contradict or tend to disprove any element of the\nstatutory offenses that she committed.\n   Nor does the proposition for which Davis has come to\nstand help petitioner’s cause. Although written more\nnarrowly in the context of a prosecution for the crime of\nmurder, Davis was later interpreted to establish a general\n“rule for federal prosecutions . . . that an accused is ‘enti\ntled to an acquittal of the specific crime charged if upon all\nthe evidence there is reasonable doubt whether he was\ncapable in law of committing crime.’ ” Leland v. Oregon,\n343 U. S. 790, 797 (1952) (quoting Davis, 160 U. S., at\n484); see also Lynch v. Overholser, 369 U. S. 705, 713\n(1962) (explaining that the Davis rule applied in all fed\neral courts). After Davis, if a federal defendant introduced\nsufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt as to his\nsanity, it was sufficient to create a question for the jury on\nwhich the Government bore the ultimate burden of per\nsuasion beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., Hall v.\nUnited States, 295 F. 2d 26, 28 (CA4 1961); Holloway v.\nUnited States, 148 F. 2d 665, 666 (CADC 1945); Post v.\nUnited States, 135 F. 1, 10 (CA5 1905).\n   In apparent recognition of the fact that Davis relied on\nthe heightened mens rea applicable to the particular stat\n10               DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nute at issue, we held in Leland that this rule was not\nconstitutionally mandated, 343 U. S., at 797, and Con\ngress overruled it by statute in 1984, requiring a defen\ndant to prove his insanity by clear and convincing evi\ndence, 98 Stat. 2057, codified at 18 U. S. C. §17(b).\nMoreover, Congress has treated the defense of insanity\ndifferently from that of duress not only by codifying it but\nby requiring defendants who intend to rely on an insanity\ndefense to provide advance notice to the Government. See\nFed. Rule Crim. Proc. 12.2(a). Thus, even if the rule aris\ning from Davis may have once been relevant to an evalua\ntion of other affirmative defenses, Congress’ differential\ntreatment of the insanity defense and its rejection of the\nDavis rule are inconsistent with petitioner’s invitation to\nfollow Davis’ lead in this case.\n   Indeed, petitioner’s reliance on Davis ignores the fact\nthat federal crimes “are solely creatures of statute,” Lipa\nrota, 471 U. S., at 424, and therefore that we are required\nto effectuate the duress defense as Congress “may have\ncontemplated” it in the context of these specific offenses,\nUnited States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Cooperative,\n532 U. S. 483, 491, n. 3 (2001) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also id., at 499 (STEVENS, J., concurring in\njudgment) (explaining that Court was addressing whether\nthe statute at issue foreclosed a necessity defense to spe\ncific charges brought under the statute); Bailey, 444 U. S.,\nat 410 (“We need not speculate now, however, on the\nprecise contours of whatever defenses of duress or neces\nsity are available against charges brought under [18\nU. S. C.] §751(a)”). The offenses at issue in this case were\ncreated by statute in 1968, when Congress enacted the\nOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act (hereinafter\nSafe Streets Act or Act). See 82 Stat. 197. There is no\nevidence in the Act’s structure or history that Congress\nactually considered the question of how the duress defense\nshould work in this context, and there is no suggestion\n                     Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the offenses at issue are incompatible with a defense\nof duress.6 Cf. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Cooperative,\n532 U. S., at 491. Assuming that a defense of duress is\navailable to the statutory crimes at issue,7 then, we must\ndetermine what that defense would look like as Congress\n“may have contemplated” it.\n  As discussed above, the common law long required the\ndefendant to bear the burden of proving the existence of\nduress. Similarly, even where Congress has enacted an\naffirmative defense in the proviso of a statute, the “settled\nrule in this jurisdiction [is] that an indictment or other\npleading . . . need not negative the matter of an exception\nmade by a proviso or other distinct clause . . . and that it is\nincumbent on one who relies on such an exception to set it\nup and establish it.” McKelvey v. United States, 260 U. S.\n353, 357 (1922); see also United States v. Dickson, 15 Pet.\n141, 165 (1841) (calling this “the general rule of law which\nhas always prevailed, and become consecrated almost as a\nmaxim in the interpretation of statutes”). Even though the\nSafe Streets Act does not mention the defense of duress, we\ncan safely assume that the 1968 Congress was familiar with\nboth the long-established common-law rule8 and the rule\n——————\n  6 While Congress’ findings in support of the Safe Streets Act show\n\nthat Congress was concerned because “the ease with which any person\ncan acquire firearms . . . is a significant factor in the prevalence of\nlawlessness and violent crime in the United States,” §901(a)(2), 82 Stat.\n225, it would be unrealistic to read this concern with the proliferation\nof firearm-based violent crime as implicitly doing away with a defense\nas strongly rooted in history as the duress defense, see, e.g., 4 W.\nBlackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 30 (1769).\n  7 We have previously made this assumption when addressing com\n\nmon-law affirmative defenses, see United States v.

S., at 410,\nand the parties give us no reason to question it here.\n  8 Indeed, when a congressional committee did consider codifying the\n\nduress defense, it would have had the courts determine the defense\n“according to the principles of the common law as they may be inter\npreted in the light of reason and experience.” S. 1437, 95th Cong., 2d\n12                    DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\napplied in McKelvey and that it would have expected federal\ncourts to apply a similar approach to any affirmative de\nfense that might be asserted as a justification or excuse for\nviolating the new law.9\n   This conclusion is surely more reasonable than peti\ntioner’s hypothesis that Davis dramatically upset a well-\nsettled rule of law. Petitioner cites only one federal case\ndecided before 1968 for the proposition that it has been\nwell established in federal law that the Government bears\nthe burden of disproving duress beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. But that case involved a defendant’s claim that he\n“lacked the specific intent to defraud required by the\nstatute for the reason that he committed the offense under\nduress and coercion.” Johnson v. United States, 291 F. 2d\n150, 152 (CA8 1961). Thus, when the Court of Appeals\nexplained that “there is no burden upon the defendant to\nprove his defense of coercion,” id., at 155, that statement\nis best understood in context as a corollary to the by-then\nunremarkable proposition that “the burden of proof rests\nupon the Government to prove the defendant’s guilt be\nyond a reasonable doubt,” ibid. Properly understood,\nJohnson provides petitioner little help in her uphill strug\ngle to prove that a dramatic shift in the federal common-\nlaw rule occurred between Davis and the enactment of the\nSafe Streets Act in 1968.\n   Indeed, for us to be able to accept petitioner’s proposi\ntion, we would need to find an overwhelming consensus\namong federal courts that it is the Government’s burden to\ndisprove the existence of duress beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. The existence today of disagreement among the\n——————\nSess., §501 (1978).\n  9 Duress, like the defense at issue in McKelvey, is an excuse that allows\n\nan exception from liability. See, e.g., 2 LaFave §9.7, at 72 (“The ration\nale of the defense of duress is that the defendant ought to be excused\nwhen he ‘is the victim of a threat that a person of reasonable moral\nstrength could not fairly be expected to resist’ ”).\n                      Cite as: 548 U.

See also post, at 6–8 (BREYER,\nJ., dissenting) (discussing differences in treatment of the\nduress defense by the various Courts of Appeals). Also\nundermining petitioner’s argument is the fact that, in\n1970, the National Commission on Reform of Federal\nCriminal Laws proposed that a defendant prove the exis\ntence of duress by a preponderance of the evidence. See 1\nWorking Papers 278. Moreover, while there seem to be\nfew, if any, post-Davis, pre-1968 cases placing the burden\non a defendant to prove the existence of duress,10 or even\ndiscussing the issue in any way, this lack of evidence does\nnot help petitioner. The long-established common-law\nrule is that the burden of proving duress rests on the\ndefendant. Petitioner hypothesizes that Davis fomented a\nrevolution upsetting this rule. If this were true, one would\nexpect to find cases discussing the matter. But no such\ncases exist.\n   It is for a similar reason that we give no weight to the\npublication of the Model Penal Code in 1962. As petitioner\nnotes, the Code would place the burden on the government\nto disprove the existence of duress beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. See Model Penal Code §1.12, 10A U. L.

United States, 192 F. 2d 338, 358, n. 11 (CA9 1951), the\ntrial court instructed the jury that it would be warranted in acquitting the\ndefendant on the basis that she acted under duress “ ‘if you believe from\nthe evidence that the defendant committed these acts that the Govern\nment alleges . . . under a well grounded apprehension of immediate death\nor serious bodily injury . . . .’ ” This instruction did not require the Gov\nernment to disprove duress beyond a reasonable doubt, and it seemingly\nplaced the burden on the defendant to prove the existence of duress.\n14                DIXON v.

Petitioner argues that the Code reflects “well\nestablished” federal law as it existed at the time. Brief for\nPetitioner 25. But, as discussed above, no such consensus\nexisted when Congress passed the Safe Streets Act in\n1968. And even if we assume Congress’ familiarity with\nthe Code and the rule it would establish, there is no evi\ndence that Congress endorsed the Code’s views or incorpo\nrated them into the Safe Streets Act.\n  In fact, the Act itself provides evidence to the contrary.\nDespite the Code’s careful delineation of mental states, see\nModel Penal Code §2.02, 10A U. L. A., at 94–95, the Safe\nStreets Act attached no explicit mens rea requirement to\nthe crime of receiving a firearm while under indictment,\n§924(a), 82 Stat. 233 (“Whoever violates any provision of\nthis chapter . . . shall be fined not more than $5,000 or\nimprisoned not more than five years, or both”). And when\nCongress amended the Act to impose a mens rea require\nment, it punished people who “willfully” violate the stat\nute, see 100 Stat. 456, a mental state that has not been\nembraced by the Code, see Model Penal Code §2.02(2), 10A\nU. L. A., at 94–95 (defining “purposely,” “knowingly,”\n“recklessly,” and “negligently”); Explanatory Note, p. 97\n(“Though the term ‘wilfully’ is not used in the definitions\nof crimes contained in the Code, its currency and its exis\ntence in offenses outside the criminal code suggest the\ndesirability of clarification”). Had Congress intended to\nadopt the Code’s structure when it enacted or amended\nthe Safe Streets Act, one would expect the Act’s form and\nlanguage to adhere much more closely to that used by the\nCode. It does not, and, for that reason, we cannot rely on\nthe Model Penal Code to provide evidence as to how Con\ngress would have wanted us to effectuate the duress de\nfense in this context.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

The question here is how to\nproceed when Congress has enacted a criminal statute, the\nOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 82\nStat. 197 et seq. (hereinafter Safe Streets Act), without\nexplicit instructions regarding the duress defense or its\nburden of proof. See ante, at 10.\n  When issues of congressional intent with respect to the\nnature, extent, and definition of federal crimes arise, we\nassume Congress acted against certain background under\nstandings set forth in judicial decisions in the Anglo-\nAmerican legal tradition. See United States v. Bailey, 444\nU. S. 394, 415, n. 11 (1980). Those decisions, in turn, con\nsult sources such as legal treatises and the American\nLegal Institute’s Model Penal Code.

All of\nthese sources rely upon the insight gained over time as the\nlegal process continues. Absent some contrary indication\nin the statute, we can assume that Congress would not\nwant to foreclose the courts from consulting these newer\n2                 DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nsources and considering innovative arguments in resolving\nissues not confronted in the statute and not within the\nlikely purview of Congress when it enacted the criminal\nprohibition applicable in the particular case.\n   While the Court looks to the state of the law at the time\nthe statute was enacted, see ante, at 12, the better reading\nof the Court’s opinion is that isolated authorities or writ\nings do not control unless they were indicative of guiding\nprinciples upon which Congress likely would have relied.\nOtherwise, it seems altogether a fiction to attribute to\nCongress any intent one way or the other in assigning the\nburden of proof. It seems unlikely, moreover, that Congress\nwould have wanted the burden of proof for duress to vary\nfrom statute to statute depending upon the date of enact\nment. Consistent with these propositions, the Court looks\nnot only to our precedents and common-law traditions, but\nalso to the treatment of the insanity defense in a 1984\nstatute and a proposal of the National Commission on\nReform of Federal Criminal Laws, even though they both\npostdated the passage of the Safe Streets Act. See ante, at\n10, 13.\n   As there is no reason to suppose that Congress wanted\nto depart from the traditional principles for allocating the\nburden of proof, the proper approach is simply to apply\nthese principles to the context of duress. See, e.g.,\nSchaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 6–\n7) (where the plain text of the statute is “silent on the\nallocation of the burden of persuasion,” we proceed to\nconsider the “ordinary default rule” and its exceptions).\nThe facts needed to prove or disprove the defense “lie\npeculiarly in the knowledge of” the defendant. 2 K.

There is good reason, then, to\nmaintain the usual rule of placing the burden of produc\ntion and persuasion together on the party raising the\nissue. See 2 Broun, supra, §337; ante, at 6.

See\n4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England\n30 (1769). When Congress began to enact federal criminal\nstatutes, it presumptively intended for those offenses to be\nsubject to this defense. Moreover, Congress presumptively\nintended for the burdens of production and persuasion to\nbe placed, as they were at common law, on the defendant.\nAlthough Congress is certainly free to alter this pattern\nand place one or both burdens on the prosecution, either\nfor all or selected federal crimes, Congress has not done so\nbut instead has continued to revise the federal criminal\nlaws and to create new federal crimes without addressing\nthe issue of duress. Under these circumstances, I believe\nthat the burdens remain where they were when Congress\nbegan enacting federal criminal statutes.\n   I do not assume that Congress makes a new, implicit\njudgment about the allocation of these burdens whenever\nit creates a new federal crime or, for that matter, when\never it substantially revises an existing criminal statute.\n2                DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nIt is unrealistic to assume that on every such occasion\nCongress surveys the allocation of the burdens of proof on\nduress under the existing federal case law and under the\nlaw of the States and tacitly adopts whatever the pre\ndominant position happens to be at the time. Such a\nmethodology would create serious problems for the district\ncourts and the courts of appeals when they are required to\ndecide where the burden of persuasion should be allocated\nfor federal crimes enacted on different dates. If the alloca\ntion differed for different offenses, there might be federal\ncriminal cases in which the trial judge would be forced to\ninstruct the jury that the defendant bears the burden of\npersuasion on this defense for some of the offenses\ncharged in the indictment and that the prosecution bears\nthe burden on others.\n   I would also not assume, as JUSTICE BREYER does, see\npost, at 2–3, that Congress has implicitly delegated to the\nfederal courts the task of deciding in the manner of a\ncommon-law court where the burden of persuasion should\nbe allocated. The allocation of this burden is a debatable\npolicy question with an important empirical component.\nIn the absence of specific direction from Congress, cf. Fed.\nRule Evid. 501, I would not assume that Congress has\nconferred this authority on the Judiciary.\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

Historically, that defense\n“excuse[d] criminal conduct” if (1) a “threat of imminent\ndeath or serious bodily injury” led the defendant to commit\nthe crime, (2) the defendant had no reasonable, legal\nalternative to breaking the law, and (3) the defendant was\nnot responsible for creating the threat. United States v.\nBailey, 444 U. S. 394, 409–410 (1980); see also 2 W. LaFave,\nSubstantive Criminal Law §9.7(b), pp. 74–82 (2003) (here\ninafter LaFave); ante, at 2, n. 1 (opinion of the Court). The\nCourt decides today in respect to federal crimes that the\ndefense must bear the burden of both producing evidence\nof duress and persuading the jury. I agree with the major\nity that the burden of production lies on the defendant,\nthat here the burden of persuasion issue is not constitu\ntional, and that Congress may allocate that burden as it\nsees fit. But I also believe that, in the absence of any\nindication of a different congressional intent, the burden of\npersuading the jury beyond a reasonable doubt should lie\nwhere such burdens normally lie in criminal cases, upon\nthe prosecution.\n                          I\n  My disagreement with the majority in part reflects my\n2                 DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndifferent view about how we should determine the rele\nvant congressional intent. Where Congress speaks about\nburdens of proof, we must, of course, follow what it says.\nBut suppose, as is normally the case, that the relevant\nfederal statute is silent? The majority proceeds on the\nassumption that Congress wished courts to fill the gap by\nexamining judicial practice at the time that Congress\nenacted the particular criminal statute in question. Ante,\nat 10–14 (opinion of the Court). I would not follow that\napproach.\n   To believe Congress intended the placement of such\nburdens to vary from statute to statute and time to time is\nboth unrealistic and risks unnecessary complexity, jury\nconfusion, and unfairness. It is unrealistic because the\nsilence could well mean only that Congress did not specifi\ncally consider the “burden of persuasion” in respect to a\nduress defense. It simply did not think about that secon\ndary matter. Had it done so, would Congress have wanted\ncourts to freeze current practice statute-by-statute?\nWould it have wanted to impose different burden-of-proof\nrequirements where claims of duress are identical, where\nstatutes are similar, where the only relevant difference is\nthe time of enactment? Why? Indeed, individual in\nstances of criminal conduct often violate several statutes.\nIn a trial for those violations, is the judge to instruct the\njury to apply different standards of proof to a duress de\nfense depending upon when Congress enacted the particu\nlar statute in question? What if in this very case the\ndefendant’s boyfriend had given her drug money and\ninsisted (under threat of death) not only that she use some\nof the money to buy him a gun, but that she launder the\nrest? See 18 U. S. C. §1956 (2000 ed. and Supp. II); see\ninfra, at 6–7.\n   I would assume instead that Congress’ silence typically\nmeans that Congress expected the courts to develop bur\nden rules governing affirmative defenses as they have\n                 Cite as: 548 U.

See Davis v. United States, 160 U. S. 469\n(1895); McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332, 341\n(1943); ante, at 11, n. 8 (opinion of the Court) (proposed\ngeneral revision of the federal criminal code would have\ninstructed courts to determine the contours of affirmative\ndefenses “ ‘according to the principles of the common law\nas they may be interpreted in the light of reason and\nexperience’ ”); 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence §2486, p. 291 (J.\nChadbourn rev. ed. 1981) (allocation of the burdens of\nproof present courts with questions “of policy and fairness\nbased on experience in the different situations”). That\napproach would produce uniform federal practice across\ndifferent affirmative defenses, as well as across statutes\npassed at different points in time.\n                             II\n  My approach leads me to conclude that in federal crimi\nnal cases, the prosecution should bear the duress defense\nburden of persuasion. The issue is a close one. In Black-\nstone’s time the accused bore the burden of proof for all\naffirmative defenses. See 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries\n*201; Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 201–202\n(1977). And 20th-century experts have taken different\npositions on the matter. The Model Penal Code, for exam\nple, recommends placing the burden of persuasion on the\nprosecution.     ALI, Model Penal Code §1.12, p. 16,\n§1.13(9)(c), p. 18, §2.09, pp. 37–38 (1985). The Brown\nCommission recommends placing it upon the defendant.\nNational Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal\nLaws, 1 Working Papers 278 (1970). And the proposed\nrevision of the federal criminal code, agnostically, would\nhave turned the matter over to the courts for decision.\nS. 1722, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., §501 (1979). Moreover,\n4                 DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthere is a practical argument that favors the Govern\nment’s position here, namely that defendants should bear\nthe burden of persuasion because defendants often have\nsuperior access to the relevant proof.\n  Nonetheless, several factors favor placing the burden on\nthe prosecution. For one thing, in certain respects the\nquestion of duress resembles that of mens rea, an issue\nthat is always for the prosecution to prove beyond a rea\nsonable doubt. See In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364\n(1970); Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S. 228, 234 (1987). The\nquestions are not the same. The defendant’s criminal\nactivity here was voluntary; no external principle, such as\nthe wind, propelled her when she acted. The Nico\nmachean Ethics of Aristotle, p. 54 (R. W. Browne transl.\n1865). Moreover, her actions were intentional. Whether\nshe wanted to buy the guns or not, and whether she\nwanted to lie while doing so or not, she decided to do these\nthings and knew that she was doing them. Indeed, her\naction was willful in the sense that she knew that to do\nthem was to break the law. Ante, at 3–4 (opinion of the\nCourt); see also Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U. S. 135,\n136–137 (1994).\n  Nonetheless, where a defendant acts under duress, she\nlacks any semblance of a meaningful choice. In that sense\nher choice is not free. As Blackstone wrote, the criminal\nlaw punishes “abuse[s] of th[e] free will”; hence “it is\nhighly just and equitable that a man should be excused for\nthose acts, which are done through unavoidable force and\ncompulsion.” 4 Commentaries *27. And it is in this “force\nand compulsion,” acting upon the will, that the resem\nblance to lack of mens rea lies. Cf. Austin, Ifs and Cans, in\nProceedings of the British Academy 123–124 (1956) (not\ning difference between choosing to do something where one\nhas the opportunity and ability to do otherwise and choos\ning to do something where one lacks any such opportunity\nor ability). Davis v. United States, supra, allocated the\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfederal insanity defense burden to the Government partly\nfor these reasons. That case, read in light of Leland v.\nOregon, 343 U. S. 790, 797 (1952), suggests that, even if\ninsanity does not always show the absence of mens rea, it\ndoes show the absence of a “‘vicious will.’ ” Davis, supra, at\n484 (citing Blackstone; emphasis added).\n   For another thing, federal courts (as a matter of statu\ntory construction or supervisory power) have imposed the\nfederal-crime burden of persuasion upon the prosecution\nin respect to self-defense, insanity, and entrapment, which\nresemble the duress defense in certain relevant ways. In\nrespect to both duress and self-defense, for example, the\ndefendant’s illegal act is voluntary, indeed, intentional;\nbut the circumstances deprive the defendant of any mean\ningful ability or opportunity to act otherwise, depriving\nthe defendant of a choice that is free. Insanity, as I said,\nmay involve circumstances that resemble, but are not\nidentical to, a lack of mens rea. And entrapment requires\nthe prosecution to prove that the defendant was “predis\nposed” to commit the crime—a matter sometimes best\nknown to the defendant.\n   As to self-defense, see First Circuit Pattern Criminal\nJury Instructions §5.04 (1998); United States v.

C. §17(b) (overruling this default\nrule to place the burden on the defendant by clear and\nconvincing evidence). As to entrapment, see Jacobson v.\nUnited States, 503 U. S. 540, 554 (1992) (reversing the\njudgment affirming the conviction because “the prosecu\ntion failed, as a matter of law, to adduce evidence to sup\nport the jury verdict that petitioner was predisposed,\nindependent of the Government’s acts and beyond a rea\nsonable doubt” to commit the crime). See also Patterson,\n432 U. S., at 202 (noting that Davis “had wide impact on\nthe practice in the federal courts with respect to the bur\nden of proving various affirmative defenses”); Patterson,\nsupra, at 231 (Powell, J., dissenting) (“[S]ince this Court’s\ndecision in Davis . . . federal prosecutors have borne the\nburden of persuasion with respect to factors like insanity,\nself-defense, and malice or provocation, once the defendant\nhas carried this burden of production”).\n   Further, most federal courts, in respect to most federal\ncrimes, have imposed the burden of persuasion in respect\nto the duress defense upon the Government, following\nJohnson v. United States, 291 F. 2d 150, 155 (CA8 1961),\nand authorities such as E. Devitt & C. Blackmar, Federal\nJury Practice and Instructions §13.14, p. 293 (2d ed.\n1970), and the Federal Judicial Center Pattern Criminal\nJury Instructions §56 (1988). By the mid-1990’s, seven\ncircuits had squarely placed the burden of persuasion\nupon the prosecution; one Circuit (the Fifth) placed the\nburden on the defendant; and four (the Third, Fourth,\nEleventh, and District of Columbia) did not, as far as I can\ntell, have a definitive practice.

Petitioner adds, without\ncontradiction, that the States allocate the burden similarly\nby a ratio of 2 to 1. Brief for Petitioner 32–34; Brief for\nUnited States 38, n. 30.\n  Beginning in 1991, the matter became more complicated\nbecause the Ninth Circuit began to require the defendant\nto bear the burden of proving duress in certain circum\nstances. United States v. Dominguez-Mestas, 929 F. 2d\n1379, 1382, 1384 (1991) (per curiam). And a few years\nlater the Third, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits followed suit\nin cases concerning a closely related justification defense.\nSee United States v. Dodd, 225 F. 3d 340, 347–350 (CA3\n2000); United States v. Brown, 367 F. 3d 549, 555–556\n(CA6 2004); United States v. Deleveaux, 205 F. 3d 1292,\n1298-1300 (CA11 2000); Eleventh Circuit Pattern Crimi\nnal Jury Instructions §16 (2003). But see Sixth Circuit\nPattern Criminal Jury Instructions §6.05 (2005) (stating\nthat the burden of proof issue for duress is undecided in\nthat Circuit).\n  These latter cases, however, put the burden on the\ndefendant only where the criminal statute narrows its\nmens rea requirement, i.e., the burden is the defendant’s\nwhere the statute requires that the defendant act with\n“knowledge” but not, suggest these courts, where the\n8                 DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nstatute requires that the defendant act “willfully,” “inten\ntionally,” or “voluntarily.” See, e.g., Dominguez-Mestas,\nsupra, at 1382, 1384; United States v. Meraz-Solomon, 3\nF. 3d 298, 300 (CA9 1993); Ninth Circuit Pattern Criminal\nJury Instructions §§6.5, 6.6 (2003); but see United States\nv. Fei Lin, 139 F. 3d 1303, 1307–1308 (CA9 1998). See\nalso Eleventh Circuit Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions\n§16 (2003); United States v. Diaz, 285 F. 3d 92, 97 (CA1\n2002) (indicating that this bifurcated rule might be appro\npriate, but noting Circuit precedent to the contrary).\nSimilarly, the Tenth Circuit placed the burden of proving\nduress upon the defendant in “strict liability” cases where\nmens rea is not an element of the crime at all. United\nStates v. Unser, 165 F. 3d 755, 763–765 (CA10 1999).\n   The apparent upshot is that four Circuits now place the\nburden of persuasion on the prosecution across the board;\none places the burden on the prosecution if the statute\nrequires mens rea but not otherwise; and four have held or\nsuggested that the burden should be on the prosecution if\nthe statute requires an intentional or willful state of mind,\nbut not if the statute requires only knowledge. While the\nCircuits are divided, apparently only one (the Fifth) agrees\nwith the position taken by the Court today.\n   Further, while I concede the logic of the Government’s\npractical argument—that defendants have superior access\nto the evidence—I remain uncertain of the argument’s\nstrength. After all, “[i]n every criminal case the defendant\nhas at least an equal familiarity with the facts and in most\na greater familiarity with them than the prosecution.” Tot\nv. United States, 319 U. S. 463, 469 (1943). And the strict\ncontours of the duress defense, as well as the defendant’s\nburden of production, already substantially narrow the\ncircumstances under which the defense may be used. A\ndefendant may find it difficult, for example, to show duress\nwhere the relevant conduct took place too long before the\ncriminal act. Cf. ante, at 2 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). That is\n                  Cite as: 548 U. S. ____ (2006)              9\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nbecause the defendant must show that he had no alternative\nto breaking the law. Supra, at 1. And that will be the more\ndifficult to show the more remote the threat. See also La-\nFave, § 9.7, p. 77-79 (duress generally requires an “immedi\nate” or “imminent” threat, that the defendant “take advan\ntage of a reasonable opportunity to escape,” and that the\ndefendant “terminate his conduct ‘as soon as the claimed\nduress . . . had lost its coercive force’”). More important, the\nneed to prove mens rea can easily present precisely the same\npractical difficulties of proof for the prosecutor. Suppose for\nexample the defendant claims that an old lady told him that\nthe white powder he transported across the border was\nmedicine for her dying son. Cf. United States v. Mares, 441\nF. 3d 1152 (CA10 2006). See also Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421\nU. S., at 702 (requiring the government to prove an absence\nof passion in a murder conviction imposes “no unique hard\nship on the prosecution”).\n   It is particularly difficult to see a practical distinction\nbetween this affirmative defense and, say, self-defense.\nThe Government says that the prosecution may “be unable\nto call the witness most likely to have information bearing\non the point,” namely, the defendant. Brief for United\nStates 21. But what is the difference in this respect be\ntween the defendant here, who says her boyfriend threat\nened to kill her, and a battered woman who says that she\nkilled her husband in self-defense, where the husband’s\nevidence is certainly unavailable? See also Jacobson, 503\nU. S. 540 (entrapment; need to prove “propensity”). Re\ngardless, unless the defendant testifies, it could prove\ndifficult to satisfy the defendant’s burden of production; and,\nof course, once the defendant testifies, cross-examination is\npossible.\n   In a word, I cannot evaluate the claim of practicality\nwithout somewhat more systematic evidence of the exis\ntence of a problem, say, in those Circuits that for many\nyears have imposed the burden on the prosecutor. And, of\n10               DIXON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncourse, if I am wrong about the Government’s practical\nneed (and were my views to prevail), the Government\nwould remain free to ask Congress to reallocate the\nburden.\n   Finally, there is a virtue in uniformity, in treating the\nfederal statutory burden of persuasion similarly in respect\nto actus reus, mens rea, mistake, self-defense, entrapment,\nand duress. The Second Circuit, when imposing the bur\nden of persuasion for duress on the prosecution, wrote that\ndifferences in this respect create “a grave possibility of\njuror confusion.” United States v. Mitchell, 725 F. 2d 832,\n836 (1983) (Newman, J., joined by Feinberg, C. J., and\nFriendly, J.). They risk unfairness as well.\n   For these reasons I believe that, in the absence of an\nindication of congressional intent to the contrary, federal\ncriminal law should place the burden of persuasion in\nrespect to the duress defense upon the prosecution, which,\nas is now common in respect to many affirmative defenses,\nit must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
