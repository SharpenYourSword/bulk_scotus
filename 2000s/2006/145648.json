A jury convicted petitioner Paul Gregory House of the crime and sentenced him to death, but new revelations cast doubt on the jury's verdict. House, protesting his innocence, seeks access to federal court to pursue <span class=\"star-pagination\">*522</span> habeas corpus relief based on constitutional claims that are procedurally barred under state law. Out of respect for the finality of state-court judgments federal habeas courts, as a general rule, are closed to claims that state courts would consider defaulted. In certain exceptional cases involving a compelling claim of actual innocence, however, the state procedural default rule is not a bar to a federal habeas corpus petition. See <i>Schlup</i> v. <i>Delo,</i> 513 U. S. 298, 319-322 (1995). After careful review of the full record, we conclude that House has made the stringent showing required by this exception; and we hold that his federal habeas action may proceed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>We begin with the facts surrounding Mrs. Muncey's disappearance, the discovery of her body, and House's arrest. Around 3 p.m. on Sunday, July 14, 1985, two local residents found her body concealed amid brush and tree branches on an embankment roughly 100 yards up the road from her driveway. Mrs. Muncey had been seen last on the evening before, when, around 8 p.m., she and her two children\u0097Lora Muncey, aged 10, and Matthew Muncey, aged 8\u0097visited their neighbor, Pam Luttrell. According to Luttrell, Mrs. Muncey mentioned her husband, William Hubert Muncey, Jr., known in the community as \"Little Hube\" and to his family as \"Bubbie.\" As Luttrell recounted Mrs. Muncey's comment, Mr. Muncey \"had gone to dig a grave, and he hadn't come back, but that was all right, because [Mrs. Muncey] was going to make him take her fishing the next day,\" App. 11-12. Mrs. Muncey returned home, and some time later, before 11 p.m. at the latest, Luttrell \"heard a car rev its motor as it went down the road,\" something Mr. Muncey customarily did when he drove by on his way home. Record, Addendum 4, 5 Tr. of Evidence in No. 378 (Crim. Ct. Union Cty., Tenn.), pp. 641-642 (hereinafter Tr.). Luttrell then went to bed.</p>\n<p>Around 1 a.m., Lora and Matthew returned to Luttrell's home, this time with their father, Mr. Muncey, who said his <span class=\"star-pagination\">*523</span> wife was missing. Muncey asked Luttrell to watch the children while he searched for his wife. After he left, Luttrell talked with Lora. According to Luttrell:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[Lora] said she heard a horn blow, she thought she heard a horn blow, and somebody asked if Bubbie was home, and her mama, you know, told them\u0097no. And then she said she didn't know if she went back to sleep or not, but then she heard her mama going down the steps crying and I am not sure if that is when that she told me that she heard her mama say\u0097oh God, no, not me, or if she told me that the next day, but I do know that she said she heard her mother going down the steps crying.\" App. 14-15.</blockquote>\n<p>While Lora was talking, Luttrell recalled, \"Matt kept butting in, you know, on us talking, and he said\u0097sister they said daddy had a wreck, they said daddy had a wreck.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 13.</p>\n<p>At House's trial, Lora repeated her account of the night's events, this time referring to the \"wreck\" her brother had mentioned. To assist in understanding Lora's account, it should be noted that Mrs. Muncey's father-in-law\u0097Little Hube's father\u0097was sometimes called \"Big Hube.\" Lora and her brother called him \"Paw Paw.\" We refer to him as Mr. Muncey, Sr. According to Lora, Mr. Muncey, Sr., had a deep voice, as does petitioner House.</p>\n<p>Lora testified that after leaving Luttrell's house with her mother, she and her brother \"went to bed.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 18. Later, she heard someone, or perhaps two different people, ask for her mother. Lora's account of the events after she went to bed was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Q Laura <i>[sic],</i> at some point after you got back home and you went to bed, did anything happen that caused your mother to be upset or did you hear anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"A Well, it sounded like PawPaw said\u0097where's daddy at, and she said digging a grave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*524</span> \"Q Okay. Do you know if it was PawPaw or not, or did it sound like PawPaw?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"A It just sounded like PawPaw.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Q And your mother told him what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"A That he was digging a grave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Q Had you ever heard that voice before that said that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"A I don't remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Q After that, at some point later, did you hear anything else that caused your mother to be upset?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"A Well, they said that daddy had a wreck down the road and she started crying\u0097next to the creek.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Q Your mother started crying. What was it that they said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"A That daddy had a wreck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Q Did they say where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"A Down there next to the creek.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 18-19.</blockquote>\n<p>Lora did not describe hearing any struggle. Some time later, Lora and her brother left the house to look for their mother, but no one answered when they knocked at the Luttrells' home, and another neighbor, Mike Clinton, said he had not seen her. After the children returned home, according to Lora, her father came home and \"fixed him a bologna sandwich and he took a bit of it and he says\u0097sissy, where is mommy at, and I said\u0097she ain't been here for a little while.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 20. Lora recalled that Mr. Muncey went outside and, not seeing his wife, returned to take Lora and Matthew to the Luttrells' so that he could look further.</p>\n<p>The next afternoon Billy Ray Hensley, the victim's first cousin, heard of Mrs. Muncey's disappearance and went to look for Mr. Muncey. As he approached the Munceys' street, Hensley allegedly \"saw Mr. House come out from under a bank, wiping his hands on a black rag.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 32. Just when and where Hensley saw House, and how well he could <span class=\"star-pagination\">*525</span> have observed him, were disputed at House's trial. Hensley admitted on cross-examination that he could not have seen House \"walking up or climbing up\" the embankment, <i>id.,</i> at 39; rather, he saw House, in \"[j]ust a glance,\" <i>id.,</i> at 40, \"appear out of nowhere,\" \"next to the embankment,\" <i>id.,</i> at 39. On the Munceys' street, opposite the area where Hensley said he saw House, a white Plymouth was parked near a sawmill. Another witness, Billy Hankins, whom the defense called, claimed that around the same time he saw a \"boy\" walking down the street away from the parked Plymouth and toward the Munceys' home. This witness, however, put the \"boy\" on the side of the street with the parked car and the Munceys' driveway, not the side with the embankment.</p>\n<p>Hensley, after turning onto the Munceys' street, continued down the road and turned into their driveway. \"I pulled up in the driveway where I could see up toward Little Hube's house,\" Hensley testified, \"and I seen Little Hube's car wasn't there, and I backed out in the road, and come back [the other way].\" <i>Id.,</i> at 32. As he traveled up the road, Hensley saw House traveling in the opposite direction in the white Plymouth. House \"flagged [Hensley] down\" through his windshield, <i>ibid.,</i> and the two cars met about 300 feet up the road from the Munceys' driveway. According to Hensley, House said he had heard Mrs. Muncey was missing and was looking for her husband. <i>Id.,</i> at 33. Though House had only recently moved to the area, he was acquainted with the Munceys, had attended a dance with them, and had visited their home. He later told law enforcement officials he considered both of the Munceys his friends. According to Hensley, House said he had heard that Mrs. Muncey's husband, who was an alcoholic, was elsewhere \"getting drunk.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>As Hensley drove off, he \"got to thinking to [him]self\u0097he's hunting Little Hube, and Little Hube drunk\u0097what would he be doing off that bank ... .\" <i>Ibid.</i> His suspicion aroused, Hensley later returned to the Munceys' street with a friend named Jack Adkins. The two checked different spots on the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*526</span> embankment, and though Hensley saw nothing where he looked, Adkins found Mrs. Muncey. Her body lay across from the sawmill near the corner where House's car had been parked, dumped in the woods a short way down the bank leading toward a creek.</p>\n<p>Around midnight, Dr. Alex Carabia, a practicing pathologist and county medical examiner, performed an autopsy. Dr. Carabia put the time of death between 9 and 11 p.m. Mrs. Muncey had a black eye, both her hands were bloodstained up to the wrists, and she had bruises on her legs and neck. Dr. Carabia described the bruises as consistent with a \"traumatic origin,\" <i>i. e.,</i> a fight or a fall on hard objects. 7 Tr. 985-986. Based on the neck bruises and other injuries, he concluded Mrs. Muncey had been choked, but he ruled this out as the cause of death. The cause of death, in Dr. Carabia's view, was a severe blow to the left forehead that inflicted both a laceration penetrating to the bone and, inside the skull, a severe right-side hemorrhage, likely caused by Mrs. Muncey's brain slamming into the skull opposite the impact. Dr. Carabia described this head injury as consistent either with receiving a blow from a fist or other instrument or with striking some object.</p>\n<p>The county sheriff, informed about Hensley's earlier encounter with House, questioned House shortly after the body was found. That evening, House answered further questions during a voluntary interview at the local jail. Special Agent Ray Presnell of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) prepared a statement of House's answers, which House signed. Asked to describe his whereabouts on the previous evening, House claimed\u0097falsely, as it turned out\u0097 that he spent the entire evening with his girlfriend, Donna Turner, at her trailer. Asked whether he was wearing the same pants he had worn the night before, House replied\u0097 again, falsely\u0097that he was. House was on probation at the time, having recently been released on parole following a sentence of five years to life for aggravated sexual assault in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*527</span> Utah. House had scratches on his arms and hands, and a knuckle on his right ring finger was bruised. He attributed the scratches to Turner's cats and the finger injury to recent construction work tearing down a shed. The next day House gave a similar statement to a different TBI agent, Charles Scott.</p>\n<p>In fact House had not been at Turner's home. After initially supporting House's alibi, Turner informed authorities that House left her trailer around 10:30 or 10:45 p.m. to go for a walk. According to Turner's trial testimony, House returned later\u0097she was not sure when\u0097hot and panting, missing his shirt and his shoes. House, Turner testified, told her that while he was walking on the road near her home, a vehicle pulled up beside him, and somebody inside \"called him some names and then they told him he didn't belong here anymore.\" App. 89. House said he tried to ignore the taunts and keep walking, but the vehicle pulled in behind him, and \"one of them got out and grabbed him by the shoulder... and [House] swung around with his right hand\" and \"hit something.\" <i>Ibid.</i> According to Turner, House said \"he took off down the bank and started running and he said that he\u0097he said it seemed forever where he was running. And he said they fired two shots at him while he took off down the bank ... .\" <i>Ibid.</i> House claimed the assailants \"grabbed ahold of his shirt,\" which Turner remembered as \"a blue tank top, trimmed in yellow,\" and \"they tore it to where it wouldn't stay on him and he said\u0097I just throwed it off when I was running.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 91. Turner, noticing House's bruised knuckle, asked how he hurt it, and House told her \"that's where he hit.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 90. Turner testified that she \"thought maybe my ex-husband had something to do with it.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Although the white Plymouth House drove the next day belonged to Turner, Turner insisted House had not used the car that night. No forensic evidence connected the car to the crime; law enforcement officials inspected a white towel <span class=\"star-pagination\">*528</span> covering the driver seat and concluded it was clean. Turner's trailer was located just under two miles by road, through hilly terrain, from the Muncey residence.</p>\n<p>Law enforcement officers also questioned the victim's husband. Though Mrs. Muncey's comments to Luttrell gave no indication she knew this, Mr. Muncey had spent the evening at a weekly dance at a recreation center roughly a mile and a half from his home. In his statement to law enforcement\u0097a statement House's trial counsel claims he never saw\u0097 Mr. Muncey admitted leaving the dance early, but said it was only for a brief trip to the package store to buy beer. He also stated that he and his wife had had sexual relations Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>Late in the evening on Monday, July 15\u0097two days after the murder\u0097law enforcement officers visited Turner's trailer. With Turner's consent, Agent Scott seized the pants House was wearing the night Mrs. Muncey disappeared. The heavily soiled pants were sitting in a laundry hamper; years later, Agent Scott recalled noticing \"reddish brown stains\" he \"suspected\" were blood. <i>Id.,</i> at 274-275. Around 4 p.m. the next day, two local law enforcement officers set out for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington, D. C., with House's pants, blood samples from the autopsy, and other evidence packed together in a box. They arrived at 2 a.m. the next morning. On July 17, after initial FBI testing revealed human blood on the pants, House was arrested.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The State of Tennessee charged House with capital murder. At House's trial, the State presented testimony by Luttrell, Hensley, Adkins, Lora Muncey, Dr. Carabia, the sheriff, and other law enforcement officials. Through TBI Agents Presnell and Scott, the jury learned of House's false statements. Central to the State's case, however, was what the FBI testing showed\u0097that semen consistent (or so it seemed) with House's was present on Mrs. Muncey's nightgown <span class=\"star-pagination\">*529</span> and panties, and that small bloodstains consistent with Mrs. Muncey's blood but not House's appeared on the jeans belonging to House.</p>\n<p>Regarding the semen, FBI Special Agent Paul Bigbee, a serologist, testified that the source was a \"secretor,\" meaning someone who \"secrete[s] the ABO blood group substances in other body fluids, such as semen and saliva\"\u0097a characteristic shared by 80 percent of the population, including House. <i>Id.,</i> at 55. Agent Bigbee further testified that the source of semen on the gown was blood-type A, House's own blood type. As to the semen on the panties, Agent Bigbee found only the H blood-group substance, which A and B blood-type secretors secrete along with substances A and B, and which O-type secretors secrete exclusively. Agent Bigbee explained, however\u0097using science an <i>amicus</i> here sharply disputes, see Brief for Innocence Project, Inc., as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 24-26\u0097that House's A antigens could have \"degraded\" into H, App. 57-58. Agent Bigbee thus concluded that both semen deposits could have come from House, though he acknowledged that the H antigen could have come from Mrs. Muncey herself if she was a secretor\u0097something he \"was not able to determine,\" <i>id.,</i> at 58\u0097and that, while Mr. Muncey was himself blood-type A (as was his wife), Agent Bigbee was again \"not able to determine his secretor status,\" <i>id.,</i> at 57. Agent Bigbee acknowledged on cross-examination that \"a saliva sample\" would have sufficed to determine whether Mr. Muncey was a secretor; the State did not provide such a sample, though it did provide samples of Mr. Muncey's blood. <i>Id.,</i> at 62.</p>\n<p>As for the blood, Agent Bigbee explained that \"spots of blood\" appeared \"on the left outside leg, the right bottom cuff, on the left thigh and in the right inside pocket and on the lower pocket on the outside.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 48. Agent Bigbee determined that the blood's source was type A (the type shared by House, the victim, and Mr. Muncey). He also successfully tested for the enzyme phosphoglucomutase and the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*530</span> blood serum haptoglobin, both of which \"are found in all humans\" and carry \"slight chemical differences\" that vary genetically and \"can be grouped to differentiate between two individuals if those types are different.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 49-50. Based on these chemical traces and on the A blood type, Agent Bigbee determined that only some 6.75 percent of the population carry similar blood, that the blood was \"consistent\" with Mrs. Muncey's (as determined by testing autopsy samples), and that it was \"impossible\" that the blood came from House. <i>Id.,</i> at 48-52.</p>\n<p>A different FBI expert, Special Agent Chester Blythe, testified about fiber analysis performed on Mrs. Muncey's clothes and on House's pants. Although Agent Blythe found blue jean fibers on Mrs. Muncey's nightgown, brassiere, housecoat, and panties, and in fingernail scrapings taken from her body (scrapings that also contained trace, unidentifiable amounts of blood), he acknowledged that, as the prosecutor put it in questioning the witness, \"blue jean material is common material,\" so \"this doesn't mean that the fibers that were all over the victim's clothing were necessarily from [House's] pair of blue jeans.\" 6 Tr. 864-865. On House's pants, though cotton garments both transfer and retain fibers readily, Agent Blythe found neither hair nor fiber consistent with the victim's hair or clothing.</p>\n<p>In the defense case House called Hankins, Clinton, and Turner, as well as House's mother, who testified that House had talked to her by telephone around 9:30 p.m. on the night of the murder and that he had not used her car that evening. House also called the victim's brother, Ricky Green, as a witness. Green testified that on July 2, roughly two weeks before the murder, Mrs. Muncey called him and \"said her and Little Hube had been into it and she said she was wanting to leave Little Hube, she said she was wanting to get out\u0097 out of it, and she was scared.\" 7 <i>id.,</i> at 1088. Green recalled that at Christmastime in 1982 he had seen Mr. Muncey strike Mrs. Muncey after returning home drunk.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*531</span> As Turner informed the jury, House's shoes were found several months after the crime in a field near her home. Turner delivered them to authorities. Though the jury did not learn of this fact (and House's counsel claims he did not either), the State tested the shoes for blood and found none. House's shirt was not found.</p>\n<p>The State's closing argument suggested that on the night of her murder, Mrs. Muncey \"was deceived ... . She had been told [her husband] had had an accident.\" 9 <i>id.,</i> at 1226. The prosecutor emphasized the FBI's blood analysis, noting that \"after running many, many, many tests,\" Agent Bigbee</p>\n<blockquote>\"was able to tell you that the blood on the defendant's blue jeans was not his own blood, could not be his own blood. He told you that the blood on the blue jeans was consistent with every characteristic in every respect of the deceased's, Carolyn Muncey's, and that ninety-three (93%) percent of the white population would not have that blood type... . He can't tell you one hundred (100%) percent for certain that it was her blood. But folks, he can sure give you a pretty good\u0097a pretty good indication.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1235-1236.</blockquote>\n<p>In the State's rebuttal, after defense counsel questioned House's motive \"to go over and kill a woman that he barely knew[,] [w]ho was still dressed, still clad in her clothes,\" <i>id.,</i> at 1274, the prosecutor referred obliquely to the semen stains. While explaining that legally \"it does not make any difference under God's heaven, what the motive was,\" App. 106, the prosecutor told the jury, \"you may have an idea why he did it,\" <i>ibid.:</i></p>\n<blockquote>\"The evidence at the scene which seemed to suggest that he was subjecting this lady to some kind of indignity, why would you get a lady out of her house, late at night, in her night clothes, under the trick that her husband has had a wreck down by the creek? ... Well, it is because either you don't want her to tell what indignities <span class=\"star-pagination\">*532</span> you have subjected her to, or she is unwilling and fights against you, against being subjected to those indignities. In other words, it is either to keep her from telling what you have done to her, or it is that you are trying to get her to do something that she nor any mother on that road would want to do with Mr. House, under those conditions, and you kill her because of her resistance. That is what the evidence at the scene suggests about motive.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 106-107.</blockquote>\n<p>In addition the government suggested the black rag Hensley said he saw in House's hands was in fact the missing blue tank top, retrieved by House from the crime scene. And the prosecution reiterated the importance of the blood. \"[D]efense counsel,\" he said, \"does not start out discussing the fact that his client had blood on his jeans on the night that Carolyn Muncey was killed... . He doesn't start with the fact that nothing that the defense has introduced in this case explains what blood is doing on his jeans, all over his jeans, that is scientifically, completely different from his blood.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 104-105. The jury found House guilty of murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p>The trial advanced to the sentencing phase. As aggravating factors to support a capital sentence, the State sought to prove: (1) that House had previously been convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence; (2) that the homicide was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that it involved torture or depravity of mind; and (3) that the murder was committed while House was committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing from the commission of, rape or kidnaping. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 39-2-203(i)(2), (5), (7) (1982) (repealed 1989); cf. \u00a7\u00a7 39-13-204(i)(2), (5), (7) (2003). After presenting evidence of House's parole status and aggravated sexual assault conviction, the State rested. As mitigation, the defense offered testimony from House's father and mother, as well as evidence, presented through House's mother, that House attempted suicide after the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*533</span> guilt-phase verdict. Before the attempt House wrote his mother a letter professing his innocence.</p>\n<p>In closing the State urged the jury to find all three aggravating factors and impose death. As to the kidnaping or rape factor, the prosecution suggested Mrs. Muncey was \"decoy[ed] or entic[ed] ... away from her family, and confin[ed] against her will because you know that as she was being beaten to death.\" 10 Tr. 1410. \"We also think,\" the prosecutor added, \"the proof shows strong evidence of attempted sexual molestation of the victim to accompany the taking away and murdering her.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1410-1411. Later the prosecutor argued, \"I think the proof shows in the record that it is more likely than not that having been through the process before and having been convicted of a crime involving the threat of violence, or violence to another person, aggravated sexual assault, that the defendant cannot benefit from the type of rehabilitation that correction departments can provide.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1413. The jury unanimously found all three aggravating factors and concluded \"there are no mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to outweigh the statutory aggravating circumstance or circumstances.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1454. The jury recommended a death sentence, which the trial judge imposed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed House's conviction and sentence, describing the evidence against House as \"circumstantial\" but \"quite strong.\" <i>State</i> v. <i>House,</i> 743 S. W. 2d 141, 143, 144 (1987). Two months later, in a state trial court, House filed a <i>pro se</i> petition for postconviction relief, arguing he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. The court-appointed counsel amended the petition to raise other issues, including a challenge to certain jury instructions. At a hearing before the same judge who conducted the trial, House's counsel offered no proof beyond the trial transcript. The trial court dismissed the petition, deeming House's trial counsel adequate and overruling <span class=\"star-pagination\">*534</span> House's other objections. On appeal House's attorney renewed only the jury-instructions argument. In an unpublished opinion the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, and both the Tennessee Supreme Court and this Court, <i>House</i> v. <i>Tennessee,</i> 498 U. S. 912 (1990), denied review.</p>\n<p>House filed a second postconviction petition in state court reasserting his ineffective-assistance claim and seeking investigative and/or expert assistance. After extensive litigation regarding whether House's claims were procedurally defaulted the Tennessee Supreme Court held that House's claims were barred under a state statute providing that claims not raised in prior postconviction proceedings are presumptively waived, Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-30-112 (1990) (repealed 1995), and that courts may not consider grounds for relief \"which the court finds should be excluded because they have been waived or previously determined,\" \u00a7 40-30-111 (repealed 1995). See <i>House</i> v. <i>State,</i> 911 S. W. 2d 705 (1995). This Court denied certiorari. <i>House</i> v. <i>Tennessee,</i> 517 U. S. 1193 (1996).</p>\n<p>House next sought federal habeas relief, asserting numerous claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, though deeming House's claims procedurally defaulted and granting summary judgment to the State on the majority of House's claims, held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether House fell within the \"actual innocence\" exception to procedural default that this Court recognized as to substantive offenses in <i>Schlup</i> and as to death sentences in <i>Sawyer</i> v. <i>Whitley,</i> 505 U. S. 333 (1992). Presenting evidence we describe in greater detail below, House attacked the semen and blood evidence used at his trial and presented other evidence, including a putative confession, suggesting that Mr. Muncey, not House, committed the murder. The District Court nevertheless denied relief, holding that House had neither demonstrated actual <span class=\"star-pagination\">*535</span> innocence of the murder under <i>Schlup</i> nor established that he was ineligible for the death penalty under <i>Sawyer.</i></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted a certificate of appealability under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2253(c) as to all claims in the habeas petition. On the merits a divided panel affirmed, but its opinion was withdrawn and the case taken en banc. A divided en banc court certified state-law questions to the Tennessee Supreme Court. <i>House</i> v. <i>Bell,</i> 311 F.3d 767 (CA6 2002). Concluding that House had made a compelling showing of actual innocence, and recognizing that in <i>Herrera</i> v. <i>Collins,</i> 506 U. S. 390 (1993), this Court assumed without deciding that \"in a capital case a truly persuasive demonstration of `actual innocence' made after trial would render the execution of a defendant unconstitutional, and warrant federal habeas relief if there were no state avenue open to process such a claim,\" <i>id.,</i> at 417, the six-judge majority certified questions to the State Supreme Court, 311 F. 3d, at 777-778. The questions sought \"to ascertain whether there remains a `state avenue open to process such a claim' in this case.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 768. Four dissenting judges argued the court should have reached the merits, rather than certifying questions to the state court; these judges asserted that House could not obtain relief under <i>Schlup,</i> let alone <i>Sawyer</i> and <i>Herrera.</i> 311 F. 3d, at 780-781 (opinion of Boggs, J.). A fifth dissenter explained that while he agreed with the majority that House \"presents a strong claim for habeas relief, at least at the sentencing phase of the case,\" he objected to the certification of questions to the Tennessee high court. <i>Id.,</i> at 787 (opinion of Gilman, J.). This Court denied certiorari. <i>Bell</i> v. <i>House,</i> 539 U. S. 937 (2003).</p>\n<p>The State urged the Tennessee Supreme Court not to answer the Court of Appeals' certified questions, and the state court did not do so. The case returned to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. This time an eight-judge majority affirmed the District Court's denial of habeas <span class=\"star-pagination\">*536</span> relief. 386 F. 3d 668 (2004). Six dissenters argued that House not only had met the actual-innocence standard for overcoming procedural default but also was entitled to immediate release under <i>Herrera.</i> 386 F. 3d, at 708 (opinion of Merritt, J.). A seventh dissenter (the same judge who wrote separately in the previous en banc decision) described the case as \"a real-life murder mystery, an authentic `who-done-it' where the wrong man may be executed.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 709 (opinion of Gilman, J.). He concluded such grave uncertainty necessitated relief in the form of a new trial for House. <i>Id.,</i> at 710.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 545 U. S. 1151 (2005), and now reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>As a general rule, claims forfeited under state law may support federal habeas relief only if the prisoner demonstrates cause for the default and prejudice from the asserted error. See <i>Murray</i> v. <i>Carrier,</i> 477 U. S. 478, 485 (1986); <i>Engle</i> v. <i>Isaac,</i> 456 U. S. 107, 129 (1982); <i>Wainwright</i> v. <i>Sykes,</i> 433 U. S. 72, 87 (1977). The rule is based on the comity and respect that must be accorded to state-court judgments. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Engle, supra,</i> at 126-129; <i>Wainwright, supra,</i> at 89-90. The bar is not, however, unqualified. In an effort to \"balance the societal interests in finality, comity, and conservation of scarce judicial resources with the individual interest in justice that arises in the extraordinary case,\" <i>Schlup,</i> 513 U. S., at 324, the Court has recognized a miscarriage-of-justice exception. \"`[I]n appropriate cases,'\" the Court has said, \"the principles of comity and finality that inform the concepts of cause and prejudice `must yield to the imperative of correcting a fundamentally unjust incarceration,'\" <i>Carrier, supra,</i> at 495 (quoting <i>Engle, supra,</i> at 135).</p>\n<p>In <i>Schlup,</i> the Court adopted a specific rule to implement this general principle. It held that prisoners asserting innocence as a gateway to defaulted claims must establish that, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*537</span> in light of new evidence, \"it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 513 U. S., at 327. This formulation, <i>Schlup</i> explains, \"ensures that petitioner's case is truly `extraordinary,' while still providing petitioner a meaningful avenue by which to avoid a manifest injustice.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>McCleskey</i> v. <i>Zant,</i> 499 U. S. 467, 494 (1991)). In the usual case the presumed guilt of a prisoner convicted in state court counsels against federal review of defaulted claims. Yet a petition supported by a convincing <i>Schlup</i> gateway showing \"raise[s] sufficient doubt about [the petitioner's] guilt to undermine confidence in the result of the trial without the assurance that that trial was untainted by constitutional error\"; hence, \"a review of the merits of the constitutional claims\" is justified. 513 U. S., at 317.</p>\n<p>For purposes of this case several features of the <i>Schlup</i> standard bear emphasis. First, although \"[t]o be credible\" a gateway claim requires \"new reliable evidence\u0097whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence\u0097that was not presented at trial,\" <i>id.,</i> at 324, the habeas court's analysis is not limited to such evidence. There is no dispute in this case that House has presented some new reliable evidence; the State has conceded as much, see <i>infra,</i> at 540-541. In addition, because the District Court held an evidentiary hearing in this case, and because the State does not challenge the court's decision to do so, we have no occasion to elaborate on <i>Schlup</i>'s observation that when considering an actual-innocence claim in the context of a request for an evidentiary hearing, the District Court need not \"test the new evidence by a standard appropriate for deciding a motion for summary judgment,\" but rather may \"consider how the timing of the submission and the likely credibility of the affiants bear on the probable reliability of that evidence.\" 513 U. S., at 331-332. Our review in this case addresses the merits of the <i>Schlup</i> inquiry, based on a fully developed record, and with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*538</span> respect to that inquiry <i>Schlup</i> makes plain that the habeas court must consider \"`all the evidence,'\" old and new, incriminating and exculpatory, without regard to whether it would necessarily be admitted under \"rules of admissibility that would govern at trial.\" See <i>id.,</i> at 327-328 (quoting Friendly, Is Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack on Criminal Judgments, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev. 142, 160 (1970)). Based on this total record, the court must make \"a probabilistic determination about what reasonable, properly instructed jurors would do.\" 513 U. S., at 329. The court's function is not to make an independent factual determination about what likely occurred, but rather to assess the likely impact of the evidence on reasonable jurors. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Second, it bears repeating that the <i>Schlup</i> standard is demanding and permits review only in the \"`extraordinary'\" case. <i>Id.,</i> at 327 (quoting <i>Zant, supra,</i> at 494); see also 513 U. S., at 324 (emphasizing that \"in the vast majority of cases, claims of actual innocence are rarely successful\"). At the same time, though, the <i>Schlup</i> standard does not require absolute certainty about the petitioner's guilt or innocence. A petitioner's burden at the gateway stage is to demonstrate that more likely than not, in light of the new evidence, no reasonable juror would find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\u0097or, to remove the double negative, that more likely than not any reasonable juror would have reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>Finally, as the <i>Schlup</i> decision explains, the gateway actual-innocence standard is \"by no means equivalent to the standard of <i>Jackson</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 443 U. S. 307 (1979),\" which governs claims of insufficient evidence. <i>Id.,</i> at 330. When confronted with a challenge based on trial evidence, courts presume the jury resolved evidentiary disputes reasonably so long as sufficient evidence supports the verdict. Because a <i>Schlup</i> claim involves evidence the trial jury did not have before it, the inquiry requires the federal court to assess how reasonable jurors would react to the overall, newly supplemented record. See <i>ibid.</i> If new evidence so requires, this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*539</span> may include consideration of \"the credibility of the witnesses presented at trial.\" <i>Ibid.;</i> see also <i>ibid.</i> (noting that \"[i]n such a case, the habeas court may have to make some credibility assessments\").</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, the State argues that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, has replaced the <i>Schlup</i> standard with a stricter test based on <i>Sawyer,</i> which permits consideration of successive, abusive, or defaulted sentencing-related claims only if the petitioner \"show[s] by clear and convincing evidence that, but for a constitutional error, no reasonable juror would have found the petitioner eligible for the death penalty under the applicable state law,\" 505 U. S., at 336. One AEDPA provision establishes a similar standard for second or successive petitions involving no retroactively applicable new law, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii); another sets it as a threshold for obtaining an evidentiary hearing on claims the petitioner failed to develop in state court, \u00a7 2254(e)(2). Neither provision addresses the type of petition at issue here\u0097 a first federal habeas petition seeking consideration of defaulted claims based on a showing of actual innocence. Thus, the standard of review in these provisions is inapplicable. Cf. <i>Lonchar</i> v. <i>Thomas,</i> 517 U. S. 314, 324 (1996) (\"Dismissal of a <i>first</i> federal habeas petition is a particularly serious matter\").</p>\n<p>The State also argues that the District Court's findings in this case tie our hands, precluding a ruling in House's favor absent a showing of clear error as to the District Court's specific determinations. This view overstates the effect of the District Court's ruling. Deference is given to a trial court's assessment of evidence presented to it in the first instance. Yet the <i>Schlup</i> inquiry, we repeat, requires a holistic judgment about \"`all the evidence,'\" 513 U. S., at 328 (quoting Friendly, <i>supra,</i> at 160), and its likely effect on reasonable jurors applying the reasonable-doubt standard. As a general rule, the inquiry does not turn on discrete findings <span class=\"star-pagination\">*540</span> regarding disputed points of fact, and \"[i]t is not the district court's independent judgment as to whether reasonable doubt exists that the standard addresses,\" 513 U. S., at 329. Here, although the District Court attentively managed complex proceedings, carefully reviewed the extensive record, and drew certain conclusions about the evidence, the court did not clearly apply <i>Schlup</i>'s predictive standard regarding whether reasonable jurors would have reasonable doubt. As we shall explain, moreover, we are uncertain about the basis for some of the District Court's conclusions\u0097a consideration that weakens our reliance on its determinations.</p>\n<p>With this background in mind we turn to the evidence developed in House's federal habeas proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>DNA Evidence</i></h2>\n<p>First, in direct contradiction of evidence presented at trial, DNA testing has established that the semen on Mrs. Muncey's nightgown and panties came from her husband, Mr. Muncey, not from House. The State, though conceding this point, insists this new evidence is immaterial. At the guilt phase at least, neither sexual contact nor motive were elements of the offense, so in the State's view the evidence, or lack of evidence, of sexual assault or sexual advance is of no consequence. We disagree. In fact we consider the new disclosure of central importance.</p>\n<p>From beginning to end the case is about who committed the crime. When identity is in question, motive is key. The point, indeed, was not lost on the prosecution, for it introduced the evidence and relied on it in the final guilt-phase closing argument. Referring to \"evidence at the scene,\" the prosecutor suggested that House committed, or attempted to commit, some \"indignity\" on Mrs. Muncey that neither she \"nor any mother on that road would want to do with Mr. House.\" 9 Tr. 1302-1303. Particularly in a case like this where the proof was, as the State Supreme Court observed, circumstantial, <i>State</i> v. <i>House,</i> 743 S. W. 2d, at 143, 144, we <span class=\"star-pagination\">*541</span> think a jury would have given this evidence great weight. Quite apart from providing proof of motive, it was the only forensic evidence at the scene that would link House to the murder.</p>\n<p>Law and society, as they ought to do, demand accountability when a sexual offense has been committed, so not only did this evidence link House to the crime; it likely was a factor in persuading the jury not to let him go free. At sentencing, moreover, the jury came to the unanimous conclusion, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the murder was committed in the course of a rape or kidnaping. The alleged sexual motivation relates to both those determinations. This is particularly so given that, at the sentencing phase, the jury was advised that House had a previous conviction for sexual assault.</p>\n<p>A jury informed that fluids on Mrs. Muncey's garments could have come from House might have found that House trekked the nearly two miles to the victim's home and lured her away in order to commit a sexual offense. By contrast a jury acting without the assumption that the semen could have come from House would have found it necessary to establish some different motive, or, if the same motive, an intent far more speculative. When the only direct evidence of sexual assault drops out of the case, so, too, does a central theme in the State's narrative linking House to the crime. In that light, furthermore, House's odd evening walk and his false statements to authorities, while still potentially incriminating, might appear less suspicious.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Bloodstains</i></h2>\n<p>The other relevant forensic evidence is the blood on House's pants, which appears in small, even minute, stains in scattered places. As the prosecutor told the jury, they were stains that, due to their small size, \"you or I might not detect[,] [m]ight not see, but which the FBI lab was able to find on [House's] jeans.\" App. 11. The stains appear inside the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*542</span> right pocket, outside that pocket, near the inside button, on the left thigh and outside leg, on the seat of the pants, and on the right bottom cuff, including inside the pants. Due to testing by the FBI, cuttings now appear on the pants in several places where stains evidently were found. (The cuttings were destroyed in the testing process, and defense experts were unable to replicate the tests.) At trial, the government argued \"nothing that the defense has introduced in this case explains what blood is doing on his jeans, all over [House's] jeans, that is scientifically, completely different from his blood.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 105. House, though not disputing at this point that the blood is Mrs. Muncey's, now presents an alternative explanation that, if credited, would undermine the probative value of the blood evidence.</p>\n<p>During House's habeas proceedings, Dr. Cleland Blake, an Assistant Chief Medical Examiner for the State of Tennessee and a consultant in forensic pathology to the TBI for 22 years, testified that the blood on House's pants was chemically too degraded, and too similar to blood collected during the autopsy, to have come from Mrs. Muncey's body on the night of the crime. The blood samples collected during the autopsy were placed in test tubes without preservative. Under such conditions, according to Dr. Blake, \"you will have enzyme degradation. You will have different blood group degradation, blood marker degradation.\" Record, Doc. 275, p. 80 (hereinafter R275:80). The problem of decay, moreover, would have been compounded by the body's long exposure to the elements, sitting outside for the better part of a summer day. In contrast, if blood is preserved on cloth, \"it will stay there for years,\" <i>ibid.;</i> indeed, Dr. Blake said he deliberately places blood drops on gauze during autopsies to preserve it for later testing. The blood on House's pants, judging by Agent Bigbee's tests, showed \"similar deterioration, breakdown of certain of the named numbered enzymes\" as in the autopsy samples. <i>Id.,</i> at 110. \"[I]f the victim's blood had spilled on the jeans while the victim was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*543</span> alive and this blood had dried,\" Dr. Blake stated, \"the deterioration would not have occurred,\" <i>ibid.,</i> and \"you would expect [the blood on the jeans] to be different than what was in the tube,\" <i>id.,</i> at 113. Dr. Blake thus concluded the blood on the jeans came from the autopsy samples, not from Mrs. Muncey's live (or recently killed) body.</p>\n<p>Other evidence confirms that blood did in fact spill from the vials. It appears the vials passed from Dr. Carabia, who performed the autopsy, into the hands of two local law enforcement officers, who transported it to the FBI, where Agent Bigbee performed the enzyme tests. The blood was contained in four vials, evidently with neither preservative nor a proper seal. The vials, in turn, were stored in a styrofoam box, but nothing indicates the box was kept cool. Rather, in what an evidence protocol expert at the habeas hearing described as a violation of proper procedure, the styrofoam box was packed in the same cardboard box as other evidence including House's pants (apparently in a paper bag) and other clothing (in separate bags). The cardboard box was then carried in the officers' car while they made the 10-hour journey from Tennessee to the FBI lab. Dr. Blake stated that blood vials in hot conditions (such as a car trunk in the summer) could blow open; and in fact, by the time the blood reached the FBI it had hemolyzed, or spoiled, due to heat exposure. By the time the blood passed from the FBI to a defense expert, roughly a vial and a half were empty, though Agent Bigbee testified he used at most a quarter of one vial. Blood, moreover, had seeped onto one corner of the styrofoam box and onto packing gauze inside the box below the vials.</p>\n<p>In addition, although the pants apparently were packaged initially in a paper bag and FBI records suggest they arrived at the FBI in one, the record does not contain the paper bag but does contain a plastic bag with a label listing the pants and Agent Scott's name\u0097and the plastic bag has blood on it. The blood appears in a forked streak roughly five inches long <span class=\"star-pagination\">*544</span> and two inches wide running down the bag's outside front. Though testing by House's expert confirmed the stain was blood, the expert could not determine the blood's source. Speculations about when and how the blood got there add to the confusion regarding the origins of the stains on House's pants.</p>\n<p>Faced with these indications of, at best, poor evidence control, the State attempted to establish at the habeas hearing that all blood spillage occurred after Agent Bigbee examined the pants. Were that the case, of course, then blood would have been detected on the pants before any spill\u0097which would tend to undermine Dr. Blake's analysis and support using the bloodstains to infer House's guilt. In support of this theory the State put on testimony by a blood spatter expert who believed the \"majority\" of the stains were \"transfer stains,\" that is, stains resulting from \"wip[ing] across the surface of the pants\" rather than seeping or spillage. App. 293-294. Regarding the spillage in the styrofoam box, the expert noted that yellow \"Tennessee Crime Laboratory\" tape running around the box and down all four sides did not line up when the bloodstains on the box's corner were aligned. The inference was that the FBI received the box from Tennessee authorities, opened it, and resealed it before the spillage occurred. Reinforcing this theory, Agent Bigbee testified that he observed no blood spillage in the styrofoam box and that had he detected such signs of evidence contamination, FBI policy would have required immediate return of the evidence.</p>\n<p>In response House argued that even assuming the tape alignment showed spillage occurring after FBI testing, spillage on one or more earlier occasions was likely. In fact even the State's spatter expert declined to suggest the blood in the box and on the packing gauze accounted for the full vial and a quarter missing. And when the defense expert opened the box and discovered the spills, the bulk of the blood-caked gauze was located around and underneath the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*545</span> half-full vial, which was also located near the stained corner. No gauze immediately surrounding the completely empty vial was stained. The tape, moreover, circled the box in two layers, one underneath the other, and in one spot the underlying layer stops cleanly at the lid's edge, as if cut with a razor, and does not continue onto the body of the box below. In House's view this clean cut suggests the double layers could not have resulted simply from wrapping the tape around twice, as the spatter expert claimed; rather, someone possessing Tennessee Crime Lab tape\u0097perhaps the officers transporting the blood and pants\u0097must have cut the box open and resealed it, possibly creating an opportunity for spillage. Supporting the same inference, a label on the box's lid lists both blood and vaginal secretions as the box's contents, though Agent Bigbee's records show the vaginal fluids arrived at the FBI in a separate envelope. Finally, cross-examination revealed that Agent Bigbee's practice did not always match the letter of FBI policy. Although Mrs. Muncey's bra and housecoat were packed together in a single bag, creating, according to Agent Bigbee, a risk of \"cross contamination,\" <i>id.,</i> at 286, he did not return them; nor did he note the discrepancy between the \"[b]lood and vaginal secretions\" label and the styrofoam box's actual contents, though he insisted his customary practice was to match labels with contents immediately upon opening an evidence box, <i>id.,</i> at 287.</p>\n<p>The State challenged Dr. Blake's scientific conclusions, and to do so it called Agent Bigbee as a witness. Agent Bigbee defended the testimony he had given at the trial. To begin with, he suggested Dr. Blake had misconstrued the term \"inc\" in Agent Bigbee's trial report, interpreting it to mean \"incomplete\" when it in fact meant \"inconclusive.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 254-256, 282. Dr. Blake, however, replied \"[s]ame difference\" when asked whether his opinion would change if \"inc\" meant \"inconclusive.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 256; see also 6 Tr. 906 (Bigbee trial testimony) (\"You will notice I have INC written under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*546</span> the transparent, that is the symbol that I use to mean the test was incomplete\"). Agent Bigbee further asserted that, whereas Dr. Blake (in Bigbee's view) construed the results to mean the enzyme was not present at all, in fact the results indicated only that Bigbee could not identify the marker type on whatever enzymes were present. App. 282. Yet the State did not cross-examine Dr. Blake on this point, nor did the District Court resolve the dispute one way or the other, so on this record it seems possible that Dr. Blake meant only to suggest the blood was too degraded to permit conclusive typing. The State, moreover, does not ask us to question Dr. Blake's basic premise about the durability of blood chemicals deposited on cotton\u0097a premise Agent Bigbee appeared to accept as a general matter. Given the record as it stands, then, we cannot say Dr. Blake's conclusions have been discredited; if other objections might be adduced, they must await further proceedings. At the least, the record before us contains credible testimony suggesting that the missing enzyme markers are generally better preserved on cloth than in poorly kept test tubes, and that principle could support House's spillage theory for the blood's origin.</p>\n<p>In this Court, as a further attack on House's showing, the State suggests that, given the spatter expert's testimony, House's theory would require a jury to surmise that Tennessee officials donned the pants and deliberately spread blood over them. We disagree. This should be a matter for the trier of fact to consider in the first instance, but we can note a line of argument that could refute the State's position. It is correct that the State's spatter expert opined that the stains resulted from wiping or smearing rather than direct spillage; and she further stated that the distribution of stains in some spots suggests the pants were \"folded in some manner or creased in some manner\" when the transfers occurred, <i>id.,</i> at 296. While the expert described this pattern, at least with respect to stains on the lap of the pants, as \"consistent\" with the pants being worn at the time of the staining, <i>ibid.,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*547</span> her testimony, as we understand it, does not refute the hypothesis that the packaging of the pants for transport was what caused them to be folded or creased. It seems permissible, moreover, to conclude that the small size and wide distribution of stains\u0097inside the right pocket, outside that pocket, near the inside button, on the left thigh and outside leg, on the seat of the pants, and on the right bottom cuff, including inside the pants\u0097fits as well with spillage in transport as with wiping and smearing from bloody objects at the crime scene, as the State proposes. (As has been noted, no blood was found on House's shoes.)</p>\n<p>The District Court discounted Dr. Blake's opinion, not on account of Blake's substantive approach, but based on testimony from Agent Scott indicating he saw, as the District Court put it, \"what appeared to be bloodstains on Mr. House's blue jeans when the jeans were removed from the laundry hamper at Ms. Turner's trailer.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 348. This inference seems at least open to question, however. Agent Scott stated only that he \"saw reddish brownish stains [he] suspected to be blood\"; he admitted that he \"didn't thoroughly examine the blue jeans at that time.\" R276:113-114. The pants were in fact extensively soiled with mud and reddish stains, only small portions of which are blood.</p>\n<p>In sum, considering \"`all the evidence,'\" <i>Schlup,</i> 513 U. S., at 328 (quoting Friendly, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev., at 160), on this issue, we think the evidentiary disarray surrounding the blood, taken together with Dr. Blake's testimony and the limited rebuttal of it in the present record, would prevent reasonable jurors from placing significant reliance on the blood evidence. We now know, though the trial jury did not, that an Assistant Chief Medical Examiner believes the blood on House's jeans must have come from autopsy samples; that a vial and a quarter of autopsy blood is unaccounted for; that the blood was transported to the FBI together with the pants in conditions that could have caused vials to spill; that the blood did indeed spill at least once during its journey <span class=\"star-pagination\">*548</span> from Tennessee authorities through FBI hands to a defense expert; that the pants were stored in a plastic bag bearing both a large blood stain and a label with TBI Agent Scott's name; and that the styrofoam box containing the blood samples may well have been opened before it arrived at the FBI lab. Thus, whereas the bloodstains, emphasized by the prosecution, seemed strong evidence of House's guilt at trial, the record now raises substantial questions about the blood's origin.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A Different Suspect</i></h2>\n<p>Were House's challenge to the State's case limited to the questions he has raised about the blood and semen, the other evidence favoring the prosecution might well suffice to bar relief. There is, however, more; for in the post-trial proceedings House presented troubling evidence that Mr. Muncey, the victim's husband, himself could have been the murderer.</p>\n<p>At trial, as has been noted, the jury heard that roughly two weeks before the murder Mrs. Muncey's brother received a frightened phone call from his sister indicating that she and Mr. Muncey had been fighting, that she was scared, and that she wanted to leave him. The jury also learned that the brother once saw Mr. Muncey \"smac[k]\" the victim. 7 Tr. 1087-1088. House now has produced evidence from multiple sources suggesting that Mr. Muncey regularly abused his wife. For example, one witness\u0097Kathy Parker, a lifelong area resident who denied any animosity toward Mr. Muncey\u0097recalled that Mrs. Muncey \"was constantly with black eyes and busted mouth.\" App. 235. In addition Hazel Miller, who is Kathy Parker's mother and a lifelong acquaintance of Mr. Muncey, testified at the habeas hearing that two or three months before the victim's death Mr. Muncey came to Miller's home and \"tried to get my daughter [Parker] to go out with him,\" R274:47. (Parker had dated Mr. Muncey at age 14.) According to Miller, Muncey said \"[h]e was upset with his wife, that they had had an argument <span class=\"star-pagination\">*549</span> and he said he was going to get rid of that woman one way or the other.\" App. 236.</p>\n<p>Another witness\u0097Mary Atkins, also an area native who \"grew up\" with Mr. Muncey and professed no hard feelings, R274:10, 16\u0097claims she saw Mr. Muncey \"backhan[d]\" Mrs. Muncey on the very night of the murder. App. 226, 228. Atkins recalled that during a break in the recreation center dance, she saw Mr. Muncey and his wife arguing in the parking lot. Mr. Muncey \"grabbed her and he just backhanded her.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 228. After that, Mrs. Muncey \"left walking.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 229. There was also testimony from Atkins' mother, named Artie Lawson. A self-described \"good friend\" of Mr. Muncey, <i>id.,</i> at 231, Lawson said Mr. Muncey visited her the morning after the murder, before the body was found. According to Lawson, Mr. Muncey asked her to tell anyone who inquired not only that she had been at the dance the evening before and had seen him, but also that he had breakfasted at her home at 6 o'clock that morning. Lawson had not in fact been at the dance, nor had Mr. Muncey been with her so early.</p>\n<p>Of most importance is the testimony of Kathy Parker and her sister Penny Letner. They testified at the habeas hearing that, around the time of House's trial, Mr. Muncey had confessed to the crime. Parker recalled that she and \"some family members and some friends [were] sitting around drinking\" at Parker's trailer when Mr. Muncey \"just walked in and sit down.\" R274:37. Muncey, who had evidently been drinking heavily, began \"rambling off ... [t]alking about what happened to his wife and how it happened and he didn't mean to do it.\" <i>Ibid.</i> According to Parker, Mr. Muncey \"said they had been into [an] argument and he slapped her and she fell and hit her head and it killed her and he didn't mean for it to happen.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 38. Parker said she \"freaked out and run him off.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Letner similarly recalled that at some point either \"during [House's] trial or just before,\" <i>id.,</i> at 30, Mr. Muncey intruded <span class=\"star-pagination\">*550</span> on a gathering at Parker's home. Appearing \"pretty well blistered,\" Muncey \"went to crying and was talking about his wife and her death and he was saying that he didn't mean to do it.\" App. 232. \"[D]idn't mean to do what[?],\" Letner asked, R274:33, at which point Mr. Muncey explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[S]he was `bitching him out' because he didn't take her fishing that night, that he went to the dance instead. He said when he come home that she was still on him pretty heavily `bitching him out' again and that he smacked her and that she fell and hit her head. He said I didn't mean to do it, but I had to get rid of her, because I didn't want to be charged with murder.\" App. 232-233.</blockquote>\n<p>Letner, who was then 19 years old with a small child, said Mr. Muncey's statement \"scared [her] quite badly,\" so she \"got out of there immediately.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 233. Asked whether she reported the incident to the authorities, Letner stated, \"I was frightened, you know.... I figured me being 19 year old they wouldn't listen to anything I had to say.\" R274:31. Parker, on the other hand, claimed she (Parker) in fact went to the Sheriff's Department, but no one would listen:</p>\n<blockquote>\"I tried to speak to the Sheriff but he was real busy. He sent me to a deputy. The deputy told me to go upstairs to the courtroom and talk to this guy, I can't remember his name. I never did really get to talk to anybody.\" App. 234.</blockquote>\n<p>Parker said she did not discuss the matter further because \"[t]hey had it all signed, sealed and delivered. We didn't know anything to do until we heard that they reopened [House's] trial.\" R274:45. Parker's mother, Hazel Miller, confirmed she had driven Parker to the courthouse, where Parker \"went to talk to some of the people about this case.\" App. 237.</p>\n<p>Other testimony suggests Mr. Muncey had the opportunity to commit the crime. According to Dennis Wallace, a local <span class=\"star-pagination\">*551</span> law enforcement official who provided security at the dance on the night of the murder, Mr. Muncey left the dance \"around 10:00, 10:30, 9:30 to 10:30.\" R274:56-57. Although Mr. Muncey told law enforcement officials just after the murder that he left the dance only briefly and returned, Wallace could not recall seeing him back there again. Later that evening, Wallace responded to Mr. Muncey's report that his wife was missing. Muncey denied he and his wife had been \"a fussing or a fighting\"; he claimed his wife had been \"kidnapped.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 58. Wallace did not recall seeing any blood, disarray, or knocked-over furniture, although he admitted he \"didn't pay too much attention\" to whether the floor appeared especially clean. According to Wallace, Mr. Muncey said \"let's search for her\" and then led Wallace out to search \"in the weeds\" around the home and the driveway (not out on the road where the body was found). <i>Id.,</i> at 58, 60, 63.</p>\n<p>In the habeas proceedings, then, two different witnesses (Parker and Letner) described a confession by Mr. Muncey; two more (Atkins and Lawson) described suspicious behavior (a fight and an attempt to construct a false alibi) around the time of the crime; and still other witnesses described a history of abuse.</p>\n<p>As to Parker and Letner, the District Court noted that it was \"not impressed with the allegations of individuals who wait over ten years to come forward with their evidence,\" especially considering that \"there was no physical evidence in the Munceys' kitchen to corroborate [Mr. Muncey's] alleged confession that he killed [his wife] there.\" App. 348. Parker and Letner, however, did attempt to explain their delay coming forward, and the record indicates no reason why these two women, both lifelong acquaintances of Mr. Muncey, would have wanted either to frame him or to help House. Furthermore, the record includes at least some independent support for the statements Parker and Letner attributed to Mr. Muncey. The supposed explanation for the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*552</span> fatal fight\u0097that his wife was complaining about going fishing\u0097fits with Mrs. Muncey's statement to Luttrell earlier that evening that her husband's absence was \"all right, because she was going to make him take her fishing the next day,\" <i>id.,</i> at 11-12. And Dr. Blake testified, in only partial contradiction of Dr. Carabia, that Mrs. Muncey's head injury resulted from \"a surface with an edge\" or \"a hard surface with a corner,\" not from a fist. R275:72. (Dr. Carabia had said either a fist or some other object could have been the cause.)</p>\n<p>Mr. Muncey testified at the habeas hearing, and the District Court did not question his credibility. Though Mr. Muncey said he seemed to remember visiting Lawson the day after the murder, he denied either killing his wife or confessing to doing so. Yet Mr. Muncey also claimed, contrary to Constable Wallace's testimony and to his own prior statement, that he left the dance on the night of the crime only when it ended at midnight. Mr. Muncey, moreover, denied ever hitting Mrs. Muncey; the State itself had to impeach him with a prior statement on this point.</p>\n<p>It bears emphasis, finally, that Parker's and Letner's testimony is not comparable to the sort of eleventh-hour affidavit vouching for a defendant and incriminating a conveniently absent suspect that Justice O'Connor described in her concurring opinion in <i>Herrera</i> as \"unfortunate\" and \"not uncommon\" in capital cases, 506 U. S., at 423; nor was the confession Parker and Letner described induced under pressure of interrogation. The confession evidence here involves an alleged spontaneous statement recounted by two eyewitnesses with no evident motive to lie. For this reason it has more probative value than, for example, incriminating testimony from inmates, suspects, or friends or relations of the accused.</p>\n<p>The evidence pointing to Mr. Muncey is by no means conclusive. If considered in isolation, a reasonable jury might well disregard it. In combination, however, with the challenges <span class=\"star-pagination\">*553</span> to the blood evidence and the lack of motive with respect to House, the evidence pointing to Mr. Muncey likely would reinforce other doubts as to House's guilt.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Other Evidence</i></h2>\n<p>Certain other details were presented at the habeas hearing. First, Dr. Blake, in addition to testifying about the blood evidence and the victim's head injury, examined photographs of House's bruises and scratches and concluded, based on 35 years' experience monitoring the development and healing of bruises, that they were too old to have resulted from the crime. In addition Dr. Blake claimed that the injury on House's right knuckle was indicative of \"[g]etting mashed\"; it was not consistent with striking someone. R275:63. (That of course would also eliminate the explanation that the injury came from the blow House supposedly told Turner he gave to his unidentified assailant.)</p>\n<p>The victim's daughter, Lora Muncey (now Lora Tharp), also testified at the habeas hearing. She repeated her recollection of hearing a man with a deep voice like her grandfather's and a statement that her father had had a wreck down by the creek. She also denied seeing any signs of struggle or hearing a fight between her parents, though she also said she could not recall her parents ever fighting physically. The District Court found her credible, and this testimony certainly cuts in favor of the State.</p>\n<p>Finally, House himself testified at the habeas proceedings. He essentially repeated the story he allegedly told Turner about getting attacked on the road. The District Court found, however, based on House's demeanor, that he \"was not a credible witness.\" App. 329.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Conclusion</i></h2>\n<p>This is not a case of conclusive exoneration. Some aspects of the State's evidence\u0097Lora Muncey's memory of a deep voice, House's bizarre evening walk, his lie to law enforcement, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*554</span> his appearance near the body, and the blood on his pants\u0097still support an inference of guilt. Yet the central forensic proof connecting House to the crime\u0097the blood and the semen\u0097has been called into question, and House has put forward substantial evidence pointing to a different suspect. Accordingly, and although the issue is close, we conclude that this is the rare case where\u0097had the jury heard all the conflicting testimony\u0097it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror viewing the record as a whole would lack reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>In addition to his gateway claim under <i>Schlup,</i> House argues that he has shown freestanding innocence and that as a result his imprisonment and planned execution are unconstitutional. In <i>Herrera,</i> decided three years before <i>Schlup,</i> the Court assumed without deciding that \"in a capital case a truly persuasive demonstration of `actual innocence' made after trial would render the execution of a defendant unconstitutional, and warrant federal habeas relief if there were no state avenue open to process such a claim.\" 506 U. S., at 417; see also <i>id.,</i> at 419 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (\"I cannot disagree with the fundamental legal principle that executing the innocent is inconsistent with the Constitution\"). \"[T]he threshold showing for such an assumed right would necessarily be extraordinarily high,\" the Court explained, and petitioner's evidence there fell \"far short of that which would have to be made in order to trigger the sort of constitutional claim which we have assumed, <i>arguendo,</i> to exist.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 417, 418-419; see also <i>id.,</i> at 427 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (noting that because \"[p]etitioner has failed to make a persuasive showing of actual innocence,\" \"the Court has no reason to pass on, and appropriately reserves, the question whether federal courts may entertain convincing claims of actual innocence\"). House urges the Court to answer the question left open in <i>Herrera</i> and hold not only that free-standing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*555</span> innocence claims are possible but also that he has established one.</p>\n<p>We decline to resolve this issue. We conclude here, much as in <i>Herrera,</i> that whatever burden a hypothetical freestanding innocence claim would require, this petitioner has not satisfied it. To be sure, House has cast considerable doubt on his guilt\u0097doubt sufficient to satisfy <i>Schlup</i>'s gateway standard for obtaining federal review despite a state procedural default. In <i>Herrera,</i> however, the Court described the threshold for any hypothetical freestanding innocence claim as \"extraordinarily high.\" 506 U. S., at 417. The sequence of the Court's decisions in <i>Herrera</i> and <i>Schlup</i>\u0097first leaving unresolved the status of freestanding claims and then establishing the gateway standard\u0097implies at the least that <i>Herrera</i> requires more convincing proof of innocence than <i>Schlup.</i> It follows, given the closeness of the <i>Schlup</i> question here, that House's showing falls short of the threshold implied in <i>Herrera.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>House has satisfied the gateway standard set forth in <i>Schlup</i> and may proceed on remand with procedurally defaulted constitutional claims. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p>CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom Justice SCALIA and JUSTICE THOMAS join, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>To overcome the procedural hurdle that Paul House created by failing to properly present his constitutional claims to a Tennessee court, he must demonstrate that the constitutional violations he alleges \"ha[ve] probably resulted in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*556</span> conviction of one who is actually innocent,\" such that a federal court's refusal to hear the defaulted claims would be a \"miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Schlup</i> v. <i>Delo,</i> 513 U. S. 298, 326, 327 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). To make the requisite showing of actual innocence, House must produce \"new <i>reliable</i> evidence\" and \"must show that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in the light of the new evidence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 324, 327 (emphasis added). The question is not whether House was prejudiced at his trial because the jurors were not aware of the new evidence, but whether all the evidence, considered together, proves that House was actually innocent, so that no reasonable juror would vote to convict him. Considering all the evidence, and giving due regard to the District Court's findings on whether House's new evidence was reliable, I do not find it probable that no reasonable juror would vote to convict him, and accordingly I dissent.</p>\n<p>Because I do not think that House has satisfied the actual innocence standard set forth in <i>Schlup,</i> I do not believe that he has met the higher threshold for a freestanding innocence claim, assuming such a claim exists. See <i>Herrera</i> v. <i>Collins,</i> 506 U. S. 390, 417 (1993). I therefore concur in the judgment with respect to the Court's disposition of that separate claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In <i>Schlup,</i> we stated that a habeas petitioner attempting to present a defaulted claim to a federal court must present \"new <i>reliable</i> evidence\u0097whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence\u0097that was not presented at trial.\" 513 U. S., at 324 (emphasis added). Implicit in the requirement that a habeas petitioner present reliable evidence is the expectation that a factfinder will assess reliability. The new evidence at issue in <i>Schlup</i> had not been subjected to such an assessment\u0097the claim in <i>Schlup</i> was for an evidentiary hearing\u0097 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*557</span> and this Court specifically recognized that the \"new statements may, of course, be unreliable.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 331. The Court stated that the District Court, as the \"reviewing tribunal,\" was tasked with assessing the \"probative force\" of the petitioner's new evidence of innocence, and \"may have to make some credibility assessments.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 327-328, 330. Indeed, the Supreme Court took the unusual step of remanding the case to the Court of Appeals \"with instructions to remand to the District Court,\" so that the District Court could consider how the \"likely credibility of the affiants\" bears upon the \"probable reliability\" of the new evidence. <i>Id.,</i> at 332. In short, the new evidence is not simply taken at face value; its reliability has to be tested.</p>\n<p>Critical to the Court's conclusion here that House has sufficiently demonstrated his innocence are three pieces of new evidence presented to the District Court: DNA evidence showing that the semen on Carolyn Muncey's clothing was from her husband, Hubert Muncey, not from House; testimony from new witnesses implicating Mr. Muncey in the murder; and evidence indicating that Mrs. Muncey's blood spilled from test tubes containing autopsy samples in an evidence container. To determine whether it should open its door to House's defaulted constitutional claims, the District Court considered this evidence in a comprehensive evidentiary hearing. As House presented his new evidence, and as the State rebutted it, the District Court observed the witnesses' demeanor, examined physical evidence, and made findings about whether House's new evidence was in fact reliable. This factfinding role is familiar to a district court. \"The trial judge's major role is the determination of fact, and with experience in fulfilling that role comes expertise.\" <i>Anderson</i> v. <i>Bessemer City,</i> 470 U. S. 564, 574 (1985).</p>\n<p>The State did not contest House's new DNA evidence excluding him as the source of the semen on Mrs. Muncey's clothing, but it strongly contested the new testimony implicating <span class=\"star-pagination\">*558</span> Mr. Muncey, and it insisted that the blood spillage occurred <i>after</i> the FBI tested House's jeans and determined that they were stained with Mrs. Muncey's blood.</p>\n<p>At the evidentiary hearing, sisters Kathy Parker and Penny Letner testified that 14 years earlier, either during or around the time of House's trial, they heard Mr. Muncey drunkenly confess to having accidentally killed his wife when he struck her in their home during an argument, causing her to fall and hit her head. Record, Doc. 274, pp. 28-29, 30, 37-38. <i>Schlup</i> provided guidance on how a district court should assess this type of new evidence: The court \"may consider how the timing of the submission and the likely credibility of the affiants bear on the probable reliability of that evidence,\" and it \"must assess the probative force of the newly presented evidence in connection with the evidence of guilt adduced at trial.\" 513 U. S., at 332. Consistent with this guidance, the District Court concluded that the sisters' testimony was not credible. The court noted that it was \"not impressed with the allegations of individuals who wait over ten years to come forward.\" App. 348. It also considered how the new testimony fit within the larger web of evidence, observing that Mr. Muncey's alleged confession contradicted the testimony of the Munceys' \"very credible\" daughter, Lora Tharp, who consistently testified that she did not hear a fight in the house that night, but instead heard a man with a deep voice who lured her mother from the house by saying that Mr. Muncey had been in a wreck near the creek. <i>Id.,</i> at 323, 348.</p>\n<p>The District Court engaged in a similar reliability inquiry with regard to House's new evidence of blood spillage. At the evidentiary hearing, House conceded that FBI testing showed that his jeans were stained with Mrs. Muncey's blood, but he set out to prove that the blood spilled from test tubes containing autopsy samples, and that it did so before the jeans were tested by the FBI. The District Court summarized the testimony of the various witnesses who handled <span class=\"star-pagination\">*559</span> the evidence and their recollections about bloodstains and spillage; it acknowledged that House's expert, Dr. Cleland Blake, disagreed with FBI Agent Paul Bigbee about how to interpret the results of Agent Bigbee's genetic marker analysis summary; and it summarized the testimony of the State's blood spatter expert, Paulette Sutton. <i>Id.,</i> at 339-347. After reviewing all the evidence, the District Court stated: \"Based upon the evidence introduced during the evidentiary hearing . . . the court concludes that the spillage occurred <i>after</i> the FBI crime laboratory received and tested the evidence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 348 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Normally, an appellate court reviews a district court's factual findings only for clear error. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a) (\"Findings of fact, whether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses\"); <i>Bessemer City, supra,</i> at 574 (clearly-erroneous standard applies \"even when the district court's findings do not rest on credibility determinations, but are based instead on physical or documentary evidence or inferences from other facts\"). The Sixth Circuit deferred to the District Court's factual findings, 386 F. 3d 668, 684 (2004), and <i>Schlup</i> did not purport to alter\u0097but instead reaffirmed and highlighted\u0097the district court's critical role as factfinder. Yet the majority asserts that the clear error standard \"overstates the effect of the District Court's ruling,\" and then dismisses the District Court's reliability findings because it is \"uncertain about\" them, while stopping short of identifying clear error. <i>Ante,</i> at 539-540. This is a sharp departure from the guidance in <i>Schlup.</i></p>\n<p>In <i>Schlup,</i> we contrasted a district court's role in assessing the reliability of new evidence of innocence with a district court's role in deciding a summary judgment motion. 513 U. S., at 332. We explained that, in the latter situation, the district court does not assess credibility or weigh the evidence, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*560</span> but simply determines whether there is a genuine factual issue for trial. <i>Ibid.</i> Assessing the reliability of new evidence, on the other hand, is a typical factfinding role, requiring credibility determinations and a weighing of the \"probative force\" of the new evidence in light of \"the evidence of guilt adduced at trial.\" <i>Ibid.</i> We found it \"[o]bviou[s]\" that a habeas court conducting an actual innocence inquiry must do more than simply check whether there are genuine factual issues for trial. <i>Ibid.</i> The point of the actual innocence inquiry is for the federal habeas court to satisfy itself that it should suspend the normal procedural default rule, disregard the important judicial interests of finality and comity, and allow a state prisoner to present his defaulted constitutional claims to a federal court. See <i>McCleskey</i> v. <i>Zant,</i> 499 U. S. 467, 490-491 (1991).</p>\n<p>The majority surprisingly states that this guidance is inapplicable here because this case involves a \"fully developed record,\" while the District Court in <i>Schlup</i> had declined to conduct an evidentiary hearing. <i>Ante,</i> at 537-538. But the guidance is clearly applicable: The point in <i>Schlup</i> was not simply that a hearing was required, but why\u0097because the District Court had to assess the probative force of the petitioner's newly presented evidence, by engaging in factfinding rather than performing a summary-judgment-type inquiry. 513 U. S., at 331-332. That is precisely what the District Court did here. In addition to a \"fully developed record,\" we have the District Court's factual findings about the reliability of the new evidence in that record, factual findings which the majority disregards without finding clear error.</p>\n<p>The majority essentially disregards the District Court's role in assessing the reliability of House's new evidence. With regard to the sisters' testimony, the majority casts aside the District Court's determination that their statements came too late and were too inconsistent with credible record evidence to be reliable, instead observing that the women had no obvious reason to lie, that a few aspects of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*561</span> their testimony have record support, and that they recounted an uncoerced confession. <i>Ante,</i> at 551-552. As for the District Court's express finding that the autopsy blood spilled after the FBI tested House's jeans, the majority points to Dr. Blake's testimony that blood enzymes \"are generally better preserved on cloth,\" and even conjures up its own theory in an attempt to refute Ms. Sutton's expert testimony that the pattern of some bloodstains was consistent with blood being transferred while the pants were being worn. <i>Ante,</i> at 546-547 (\"This should be a matter for the trier of fact to consider in the first instance, but we can note a line of argument that could refute the State's position. . . . [Ms. Sutton's] testimony . . . does not refute the hypothesis that the packaging of the pants for transport was what caused them to be folded or creased\"); see App. 296.</p>\n<p>The majority's assessment of House's new evidence is precisely the summary-judgment-type inquiry <i>Schlup</i> said was inappropriate. 513 U. S., at 332. By casting aside the District Court's factual determinations made after a comprehensive evidentiary hearing, the majority has done little more than reiterate the factual disputes presented below. Witnesses do not testify in our courtroom, and it is not our role to make credibility findings and construct theories of the possible ways in which Mrs. Muncey's blood could have been spattered and wiped on House's jeans. The District Court did not painstakingly conduct an evidentiary hearing to compile a record for us to sort through transcript by transcript and photograph by photograph, assessing for ourselves the reliability of what we see. <i>Schlup</i> made abundantly clear that reliability determinations were essential, but were for the district court to make. <i>Id.,</i> at 331-332. We are to defer to the better situated District Court on reliability, unless we determine that its findings are clearly erroneous. We are not concerned with \"the district court's independent judgment as to whether reasonable doubt exists,\" <i>id.,</i> at 329, but the District Court here made basic factual findings about <span class=\"star-pagination\">*562</span> the reliability of House's new evidence; it did not offer its personal opinion about whether it doubted House's guilt. <i>Schlup</i> makes clear that those findings are controlling unless clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p>I have found no clear error in the District Court's reliability findings. Not having observed Ms. Parker and Ms. Letner testify, I would defer to the District Court's determination that they are not credible, and the evidence in the record undermining the tale of an accidental killing during a fight in the Muncey home convinces me that this credibility finding is not clearly erroneous. Dr. Alex Carabia, who performed the autopsy, testified to injuries far more severe than a bump on the head: Mrs. Muncey had bruises on the front and back of her neck, on both thighs, on her lower right leg and left knee, and her hands were bloodstained up to the wrists; her injuries were consistent with a struggle and traumatic strangulation. Record, Addendum 4, 7 Tr. of Evidence in No. 378 (Crim. Ct. Union County, Tenn.), pp. 984-987 (hereinafter Tr.). And, of course, Lora Tharp has consistently recalled a deep-voiced visitor arriving late at night to tell Mrs. Muncey that her husband was in a wreck near the creek. App. 19, 270.</p>\n<p>I also find abundant evidence in the record to support the District Court's finding that blood spilled within the evidence container after the FBI received and tested House's jeans. Agent Bigbee testified that there was no leakage in the items submitted to him for testing. <i>Id.,</i> at 277. The majority's entire analysis on this point assumes the agent flatly lied, though there was no attack on his credibility below. Moreover, Ms. Sutton determined, in her expert opinion, that the wide distribution of stains \"front and back, top to bottom,\" the fact that some bloodstains were mixed with mud, and the presence of bloodstains inside the pocket and inside the fly, showed that the blood was spattered and wiped\u0097not spilled\u0097on House's jeans. <i>Id.,</i> at 291-293, 295; <i>id.,</i> at 293 (\"[I]f a tube of blood had spilled on these pants, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*563</span> the stain should have been in a localized area\"); <i>id.,</i> at 294 (\"The stains also . . . either originate on the inside and don't soak out or on the outside and are not soaking to the inside. That, of course, would be what you would see with a spill\").</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting that the blood evidently spilled inside the evidence container when the jeans were protected inside a plastic zip lock bag, as shown by the presence of a bloodstain on the outside of that bag. See Record, Pl. Exh. 10-6. House's expert tested the exterior and interior of that plastic bag for bloodstains using an \"extremely sensitive\" test, and only the exterior of the bag tested positive for blood. <i>Id.,</i> Doc. 274, at 95-96. The evidence in the record indicates that the jeans were placed in the plastic bag <i>after</i> they arrived at the FBI: FBI records show that the jeans arrived there in a <i>paper</i> bag, and the plastic bag has FBI markings on it. <i>Id.,</i> Addendum 2, Trial Exh. 31, at 36; <i>id.,</i> Pl. Exh. 10-6. The bloodstain on the outside of the <i>plastic</i> bag therefore further supports the District Court's conclusion that the blood spilled <i>after</i> the evidence was received and tested by the FBI, and not en route when the jeans were in a paper bag. I suppose it is theoretically possible that the jeans were contaminated by spillage before arriving at the FBI, that Agent Bigbee either failed to note or lied about such spillage, and that the FBI then transferred the jeans into a plastic bag and put them back inside the evidence container with the spilled blood still sloshing around sufficiently to contaminate the outside of the plastic bag as extensively as it did. This sort of unbridled speculation can theoretically defeat any inconvenient fact, but does not suffice to convince me that the District Court's factual finding\u0097that the blood spilled <i>after</i> FBI testing\u0097was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the yellow \"Tennessee Crime Lab\" tape placed around the container on all four sides does not line up when the bloodstained corners of the container and its lid are aligned, showing that the blood did not spill until sometime after the container was received and opened at its first destination\u0097 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*564</span> the FBI. See <i>id.,</i> Respondent's Exh. 24; <i>id.,</i> Doc. 276, at 190-191 (testimony of Paulette Sutton). The majority points out that on one side of the container, the first of two layers of tape appears to begin cleanly at the lid's edge, and from this concludes that the container must have been cut open and resealed by Tennessee authorities en route to the FBI. <i>Ante,</i> at 545; see Record, Respondent's Exh. 23d. Even if the majority's deduction from a photograph of the container were true, it would show only that Tennessee authorities had reason to open the container once it was sealed to take something out or put something in, perhaps back at the crime lab in Union County. But even if the container had been opened before its arrival at the FBI, the majority recognizes that it was resealed with \"Tennessee Crime Lab\" tape, and the second layer of tape aligns only when the bloodstains on the container and its lid do not. <i>Ante,</i> at 544. Of course, the District Court\u0097which concluded that the blood was spilled <i>after</i> testing at the FBI laboratory\u0097had before it the box itself with the tape as the witnesses testified on the point, and not\u0097like this Court\u0097simply a photograph. See <i>Bessemer City,</i> 470 U. S., at 574 (district court's findings about physical evidence are reviewed for clear error).</p>\n<p>House's theory that the blood on his jeans was transferred there from the autopsy samples is based on Dr. Blake's reading of Agent Bigbee's enzyme marker analysis summary. After reading the summary, Dr. Blake concluded that the enzymes in the bloodstains on House's jeans and the enzymes in the autopsy samples had deteriorated to the same extent. Record, Doc. 275, at 110. In particular, he noted that the GLO1 enzyme showed \"incomplete penetration\" on both the autopsy blood and the jeans, and because enzymes are better preserved on cloth, the enzyme should have been present on the jeans. <i>Id.,</i> at 116. But Agent Bigbee disputed Dr. Blake's reading of what was, after all, Agent Bigbee's own study. He testified that \"`inc'\" on his chart meant \"inconclusive,\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*565</span> not \"incomplete penetration,\" and that the term \"inconclusive\" meant that the enzyme was present, but could not be grouped into an ABO bloodtype. <i>Id.,</i> Doc. 276, at 140. While pointing out that his summary showed different levels of enzymes in the two samples, Agent Bigbee also noted that many different factors\u0097such as heat, dirt, or bacteria in a clothes hamper\u0097could cause enzymes to degrade on cloth. <i>Id.,</i> at 139, 167-170. Considering how House's new blood spillage evidence fits within the record as a whole, I can see no clear error in the District Court's express finding that the blood spilled in the evidence container <i>after</i> the FBI found Mrs. Muncey's blood on House's jeans.</p>\n<p>The District Court attentively presided over a complex evidentiary hearing, often questioning witnesses extensively during the presentation of critical evidence. See, <i>e. g., id.,</i> Doc. 275, at 110-115. The court concisely summarized the evidence presented, then dutifully made findings about the reliability of the testimony it heard and the evidence it observed. We are poorly equipped to second-guess the District Court's reliability findings and should defer to them, consistent with the guidance we provided in <i>Schlup.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>With due regard to the District Court's reliability findings, this case invites a straightforward application of the legal standard adopted in <i>Schlup.</i> A petitioner does not pass through the <i>Schlup</i> gateway if it is \"more likely than not that there is <i>any</i> juror who, acting reasonably, would have found the petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 513 U. S., at 333 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The majority states that if House had presented just one of his three key pieces of evidence\u0097or even two of the three\u0097he would not pass through the <i>Schlup</i> gateway. See <i>ante,</i> at 548 (\"Were House's challenge to the State's case limited to the questions he has raised about the blood and semen, the other evidence favoring the prosecution might <span class=\"star-pagination\">*566</span> well suffice to bar relief\"); <i>ante,</i> at 552-553 (\"If considered in isolation, a reasonable jury might well disregard [the evidence pointing to Mr. Muncey]. In combination, however, with the challenges to the blood evidence and the lack of motive with respect to House, the evidence pointing to Mr. Muncey likely would reinforce other doubts as to House's guilt\"). According to the majority, House has picked the trifecta of evidence that places conviction outside the realm of choices <i>any</i> juror, acting reasonably, would make. Because the case against House remains substantially unaltered from the case presented to the jury, I disagree.</p>\n<p>At trial, the State presented its story about what happened on the night of Mrs. Muncey's murder. The Munceys' daughter heard a deep-voiced perpetrator arrive at the Muncey home late at night and tell Mrs. Muncey that her husband had been in a wreck near the creek. App. 19. Ms. Tharp relayed her testimony again at the evidentiary hearing, and the District Court determined that she was a \"very credible witness.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 270, 323.</p>\n<p>When police questioned House after witnesses reported seeing him emerge from the embankment near Mrs. Muncey's body shortly before it was discovered, he told two different officers that he never left Donna Turner's trailer the previous evening, even recounting the series of television programs he watched before going to bed. 7 Tr. 963-965, 1031-1032. He had worked to concoct an alibi we now know was a lie. On the day Mrs. Muncey's body was found, Bill Breeding, a criminal investigator at the Union County Sheriff's Office, observed House at the local jail and noticed that he had abrasions \"across his knuckles and about his hands,\" two or three bruises on his right arm, scratches on his chest, and his right ring finger was red and swollen. 6 <i>id.,</i> at 801-802. The interviewing officers noticed similar injuries. App. 78-80; 7 Tr. 974-975. House told them that his finger was swollen because he fell off a porch, and the scratches and bruises were from tearing down a building, and from a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*567</span> cat. <i>Ibid.</i> Ms. Turner initially confirmed House's alibi, but she changed her story when police warned her that covering up a homicide was a serious offense. <i>Id.,</i> at 1063. Ms. Turner then told police that House had in fact left her house that night between 10:30 and 10:45 p.m. <i>Id.,</i> at 1062-1063. He came back some time later panting and sweating, shirtless and shoeless, and with various injuries. App. 88-91; 8 Tr. 1154-1155.</p>\n<p>Also on the day the body was found, Sheriff Earl Loy asked House if he was wearing the same clothes he wore the night before. 6 <i>id.,</i> at 845. House \"hesitated,\" then stated that he had changed his shirt, <i>but not his jeans. Ibid.</i> In other words, he specifically tried to conceal from the police that he had worn other jeans the night before, for reasons that were to become clear. Ms. Turner revealed that House's statement that he had not changed his jeans was a lie, and police retrieved House's dirty jeans from Ms. Turner's hamper. <i>Ibid.</i> Of course, FBI testing revealed that House's jeans were stained with Mrs. Muncey's blood, and the District Court determined that House's new evidence of blood spillage did not undermine those test results. App. 348. If in fact Mrs. Muncey's blood only got on House's jeans from later evidentiary spillage, House would have had no reason to lie to try to keep the existence of the concealed jeans from the police.</p>\n<p>Through Ms. Turner's testimony at trial, the jury also heard House's story about what happened that night. He left Ms. Turner's trailer late at night to go for a walk. <i>Id.,</i> at 86. When he returned some time later\u0097panting, sweating, and missing his shirt and shoes\u0097he told her that some men in a truck tried to kill him. <i>Id.,</i> at 88-91. When Ms. Turner asked House about his injuries, he attributed them to fighting with his assailants. <i>Id.,</i> at 90; 8 Tr. 1154-1155. House retold this story to the District Court, saying that he initially lied to police because he was on parole and did not want to draw attention to himself. Record, Doc. 276, at 99, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*568</span> 108-109. In other words, having nothing to hide and facing a murder charge, House lied\u0097and when he was caught in the lie, he said he lied not to escape the murder charge, but solely to avoid unexplained difficulties with his parole officer. The jury rejected House's story about the night's events, and the District Court \"considered Mr. House's demeanor and found that he was not a credible witness.\" App. 329.</p>\n<p>The jury also heard House's attempt to implicate Mr. Muncey in his wife's murder by calling Mrs. Muncey's brother, Ricky Green, as a witness. Mr. Green testified that two weeks before the murder, his sister called him to say that she and Mr. Muncey had been fighting, that she wanted to leave him, and that she was scared. 7 Tr. 1088. Mr. Green also testified that the Munceys had marital problems, and that he had previously seen Mr. Muncey hit his wife. <i>Id.,</i> at 1087. The jury rejected House's attempt to implicate Mr. Muncey, and the District Court was not persuaded by House's attempt to supplement this evidence at the evidentiary hearing, finding that his new witnesses were not credible. App. 348.</p>\n<p>Noticeably absent from the State's story about what happened to Mrs. Muncey on the night of her death was much mention of the semen found on Mrs. Muncey's clothing. House's single victory at the evidentiary hearing was new DNA evidence proving that the semen was deposited by Mr. Muncey. The majority identifies the semen evidence as \"[c]entral to the State's case\" against House, <i>ante,</i> at 528, but House's jury would probably be quite surprised by this characterization. At trial, Agent Bigbee testified that from the semen stains on Mrs. Muncey's clothing, he could determine that the man who deposited the semen had type A blood, and was a secretor. App. 54-56. Agent Bigbee also testified that House and Mr. Muncey both have type A blood, that House is a secretor, and that \"[t]here is an <i>eighty (80%) percent</i> chance that [Mr. Muncey] is a secretor.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 55-56; 6 Tr. 952 (emphasis added). Moreover, Agent Bigbee <span class=\"star-pagination\">*569</span> informed the jury that because 40 percent of people have type A blood, and 80 percent of those people are secretors, the semen on Mrs. Muncey's clothing could have been deposited by roughly one out of every three males. <i>Id.,</i> at 957. The jury was also informed several times by the defense that Mrs. Muncey's body was found fully clothed. See, <i>e. g.,</i> 4 <i>id.,</i> at 628; 9 <i>id.,</i> at 1274.</p>\n<p>The majority describes House's sexual motive as \"a central theme in the State's narrative linking House to the crime,\" and states that without the semen evidence, \"a jury . . . would have found it necessary to establish some different motive, or, if the same motive, an intent far more speculative.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 541. The State, however, consistently directed the jury's attention <i>away</i> from motive, and sexual motive was far from a \"central theme\" of the State's case\u0097 presumably because of the highly ambiguous nature of the semen evidence recounted above. The Tennessee Supreme Court did not mention that evidence in cataloging the \"[p]articularly incriminating\" or \"[d]amaging\" evidence against House. App. 135. The State did not mention the semen evidence in its opening statement to the jury, instead focusing on premeditation. 4 Tr. 613-615. The defense used its opening statement to expose lack of motive as a weakness in the State's case. <i>Id.,</i> at 628. After the State's equivocal presentation of the semen evidence through Agent Bigbee's testimony at trial, the State again made no reference to the semen evidence or to a motive in its closing argument, prompting the defense to again highlight this omission. 9 <i>id.,</i> at 1274 (\"[W]hy was Carolyn Muncey killed? We don't know. Is it important to have some motive? In your minds? What motive did Paul Gregory House have to go over and kill a woman that he barely knew? Who was still dressed, still clad in her clothes\").</p>\n<p>In rebuttal, the State disclaimed any responsibility to prove motive, again shifting the jury's focus to premeditation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*570</span> \"The law says that if you take another person's life, you beat them, you strangle them, and then you don't succeed, and then you kill them by giving them multiple blows to the head, and one massive blow to the head, and that that causes their brains to crash against the other side of their skull, and caused such severe bleeding inside the skull itself, that you die\u0097that it does not make any difference under God's heaven, what the motive was. That is what the law is. The law is that if motive is shown, it can be considered by the jury as evidence of guilt. But the law is that if you prove that a killing was done, beyond a reasonable doubt, by a person, and that he premeditated it, he planned it, it is not necessary for the jury to conclude why he did it.\" App. 106.</blockquote>\n<p>As a followup to this explanation, when the trial was almost over and only in response to the defense's consistent prodding, the State made its first and only reference to a possible motive, followed immediately by another disclaimer:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Now, you may have an idea why he did it. The evidence at the scene which seemed to suggest that he was subjecting this lady to some kind of indignity, why would you get a lady out of her house, late at night, in her night clothes, under the trick that her husband has had a wreck down by the creek? . . . Why is it that you choke her? Why is it that you repeatedly beat her? Why is it that she has scrapes all over her body? Well, it is because either you don't want her to tell what indignities you have subjected her to, or she is unwilling and fights against you, against being subjected to those indignities. . . . That is what the evidence at the scene suggests about motive. But motive is not an element of the crime. It is something that you can consider, or ignore. Whatever you prefer. The issue is not motive. The issue is premeditation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 106-107.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*571</span> It is on this \"obliqu[e]\" reference to the semen evidence during the State's closing argument that the majority bases its assertion that House's sexual motive was a \"central theme in the State's narrative.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 531, 541. Although it is possible that one or even some jurors might have entertained doubt about House's guilt absent the clearest evidence of motive, I do not find it more likely than not that <i>every</i> juror would have done so, and that is the legal standard under <i>Schlup.</i> The majority aphoristically states that \"[w]hen identity is in question, motive is key.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 540. Not at all. Sometimes, when identity is in question, alibi is key. Here, House came up with one\u0097and it fell apart, later admitted to be fabricated when his girlfriend would not lie to protect him. Scratches from a cat, indeed. Surely a reasonable juror would give the fact that an alibi had been made up and discredited significant weight. People facing a murder charge, who are innocent, do not make up a story out of concern that the truth might somehow disturb their parole officer. And people do not lie to the police about which jeans they were wearing the night of a murder, if they have no reason to believe the jeans would be stained with the blood shed by the victim in her last desperate struggle to live.</p>\n<p>In <i>Schlup,</i> we made clear that the standard we adopted requires a \"stronger showing than that needed to establish prejudice.\" 513 U. S., at 327. In other words, House must show more than just a \"reasonable probability that . . . the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.\" <i>Strickland</i> v. <i>Washington,</i> 466 U. S. 668, 695 (1984). House must present such compelling evidence of innocence that it becomes more likely than not that no single juror, acting reasonably, would vote to convict him. <i>Schlup, supra,</i> at 329. The majority's conclusion is that given the sisters' testimony (if believed), and Dr. Blake's rebutted testimony about how to interpret Agent Bigbee's enzyme marker analysis summary (if accepted), combined with the revelation that the semen on Mrs. Muncey's clothing was deposited <span class=\"star-pagination\">*572</span> by her husband (which the jurors knew was just as likely as the semen having been deposited by House), no reasonable juror would vote to convict House. <i>Ante,</i> at 553-554. Given the District Court's reliability findings about the first two pieces of evidence, the evidence before us now is not substantially different from that considered by House's jury. I therefore find it more likely than not that in light of this new evidence, at least one juror, acting reasonably, would vote to convict House. The evidence as a whole certainly does not establish that House is actually innocent of the crime of murdering Carolyn Muncey, and accordingly I dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for the American Bar Association by <i>Michael S.

BELL, WARDEN\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 04\u20138990.      Argued January 11, 2006\u2014Decided June 12, 2006\nA Tennessee jury convicted petitioner House of Carolyn Muncey\u2019s mur\n  der and sentenced him to death. The State\u2019s case included evidence\n  that FBI testing showing semen consistent (or so it seemed) with\n  House\u2019s on Mrs. Muncey\u2019s clothing and small bloodstains consistent\n  with her blood but not House\u2019s on his jeans. In the sentencing phase,\n  the jury found, inter alia, the aggravating factor that the murder was\n  committed while House was committing, attempting to commit, or\n  fleeing from the commission of rape or kidnaping. In affirming, the\n  State Supreme Court described the evidence as circumstantial but\n  strong. House was denied state postconviction relief. Subsequently,\n  the Federal District Court denied habeas relief, deeming House\u2019s\n  claims procedurally defaulted and granting the State summary\n  judgment on most of his claims. It also found, after an evidentiary\n  hearing at which House attacked the blood and semen evidence and\n  presented other evidence, including a putative confession, suggesting\n  that Mr. Muncey committed the crime, that House did not fall within\n  the \u201cactual innocence\u201d exception to procedural default recognized in\n  Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298, and Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333.\n  The Sixth Circuit ultimately affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Because House has made the stringent showing required by the\n actual-innocence exception, his federal habeas action may proceed.\n Pp. 16\u201334.\n       (a) To implement the general principle that \u201ccomity and finality\n \u2018must yield to the imperative of correcting a fundamentally unjust in\n carceration,\u2019 \u201d Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 495, this Court has\n ruled that prisoners asserting innocence as a gateway to defaulted\n claims must establish that, in light of new evidence, \u201cit is more likely\n2                             HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty\n    beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Schlup, 513 U. S, at 327. Several fea\n    tures of Schlup\u2019s standard bear emphasis here. First, while the\n    gateway claim requires \u201cnew reliable evidence . . . not presented at\n    trial,\u201d id., at 324, the habeas court must assess the likely impact of\n    \u201c \u2018all the evidence\u2019 \u201d on reasonable jurors, id., at 329. Second, rather\n    than requiring absolute certainty about guilt or innocence, a peti\n    tioner\u2019s burden at the gateway stage is to demonstrate that more\n    likely than not, in light of the new evidence, no reasonable juror\n    would find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, this stan\n    dard is \u201cby no means equivalent to the standard of Jackson v. Vir\n    ginia, 443 U. S. 307,\u201d which governs insufficient evidence claims, id.,\n    at 330. Rather, because a Schlup claim involves evidence the trial\n    jury did not have before it, the inquiry requires the federal court to\n    assess how reasonable jurors would react to the overall, newly sup\n    plemented record. See ibid. Contrary to the State\u2019s arguments, the\n    standard of review in two provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effec\n    tive Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72244(b)(2)(B)(ii) and\n    2254(e)(2), is inapplicable here. In addition, because the standard\n    does not address a \u201cdistrict court\u2019s independent judgment as to\n    whether reasonable doubt exists,\u201d Schlup, supra, at 329, a ruling in\n    House\u2019s favor does not require the showing of clear error as to the\n    District Court\u2019s specific findings. It is with these principles in mind\n    that the evidence developed in House\u2019s federal habeas proceedings\n    should be evaluated. Pp. 16\u201320.\n          (b) In direct contradiction of evidence presented at trial, DNA\n    testing has established that semen on Mrs. Muncey\u2019s clothing came\n    from her husband, not House. While the State claims that the evi\n    dence is immaterial since neither sexual contact nor motive were\n    elements of the offense at the guilt phase, this Court considers the\n    new disclosure of central importance. This case is about who com\n    mitted the crime, so motive is key, and the prosecution at the guilt\n    phase referred to evidence at the scene suggesting that House com\n    mitted, or attempted to commit, an indignity on Mrs. Muncey. Apart\n    from proving motive, this was the only forensic evidence at the scene\n    that would link House to the murder. Law and society demand ac\n    countability for a sexual offense, so the evidence was also likely a fac\n    tor in persuading the jury not to let him go free. At sentencing,\n    moreover, the jury concluded that the murder was committed in the\n    course of a rape or kidnaping. A jury acting without the assumption\n    that the semen could have come from House would have found it nec\n    essary to establish some different motive, or, if the same motive, an\n    intent far more speculative.

S. ____ (2006)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ndence, the bloodstains on House\u2019s pants, taken together with the tes\ntimony of an Assistant Chief Medical Examiner for the State of Ten\nnessee, would prevent reasonable jurors from placing significant reli\nance on the blood evidence. The medical examiner who testified\nbelieves the blood on the jeans must have come from the autopsy\nsamples. In addition, a vial and a quarter of autopsy blood is unac\ncounted for; the blood was transported to the FBI together with the\npants in conditions that could have caused the vials to spill; some\nblood did spill at least once during the blood\u2019s journey from Tennes\nsee authorities through FBI hands to a defense expert; the pants\nwere stored in a plastic bag bearing a large bloodstain and a label\nfrom a Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agent; and the box contain\ning the blood samples may have been opened before arriving at the\nFBI lab. None of this evidence was presented to the trial jury.\nWhereas the bloodstains seemed strong evidence of House\u2019s guilt at\ntrial, the record now raises substantial questions about the blood\u2019s\norigin. Pp. 22\u201328.\n      (d) In the post-trial proceedings, House presented troubling evi\ndence that Mr. Muncey could have been the murderer. Two wit\nnesses described a confession by Mr. Muncey; two others described\nsuspicious behavior (a fight between the couple and Mr. Muncey\u2019s at\ntempt to construct a false alibi) around the time of the crime; and\nothers described a history of spousal abuse. Considered in isolation,\na reasonable jury might well disregard this evidence, but in combina\ntion with the challenges to the blood evidence and lack of motive with\nrespect to House, evidence pointing to Mr. Muncey likely would rein\nforce other doubts as to House\u2019s guilt. Pp. 28\u201333.\n      (e) The Assistant Chief Medical Examiner further testified that\ncertain injuries discovered on House after the crime likely did not re\nsult from involvement in the murder. Certain other evidence\u2014Mrs.\nMuncey\u2019s daughter\u2019s recollection of the night of the murder, and the\nDistrict Court\u2019s finding at the habeas proceeding that House was not\na credible witness\u2014may favor the State. Pp. 33\u201334.\n      (f) While this is not a case of conclusive exoneration, and the is\nsue is close, this is the rare case where\u2014had the jury heard all the\nconflicting testimony\u2014it is more likely than not that no reasonable\njuror viewing the record as a whole would lack reasonable doubt. P.\n34.\n   2. House has not shown freestanding innocence that would render\nhis imprisonment and planned execution unconstitutional under\nHerrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, in which the Court assumed with\nout deciding that \u201cin a capital case a truly persuasive demonstration\nof \u2018actual innocence\u2019 made after trial would render the execution of a\ndefendant unconstitutional, and warrant federal habeas relief if there\n4                           HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    were no state avenue open to process such a claim,\u201d id., at 417. The\n    threshold showing for such a right would be extraordinarily high, and\n    House has not satisfied whatever burden a hypothetical freestanding\n    innocence claim would require. He has cast doubt on his guilt suffi\n    cient to satisfy Schlup\u2019s gateway standard for obtaining federal re\n    view, but given the closeness of the Schlup question here, his show\n    ing falls short of the threshold implied in Herrera.

RICKY \n\n               BELL, WARDEN\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 12, 2006] \n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Some 20 years ago in rural Tennessee, Carolyn Muncey\nwas murdered. A jury convicted petitioner Paul Gregory\nHouse of the crime and sentenced him to death, but new\nrevelations cast doubt on the jury\u2019s verdict. House, pro\ntesting his innocence, seeks access to federal court to\npursue habeas corpus relief based on constitutional claims\nthat are procedurally barred under state law. Out of\nrespect for the finality of state-court judgments federal\nhabeas courts, as a general rule, are closed to claims that\nstate courts would consider defaulted. In certain excep\ntional cases involving a compelling claim of actual inno\ncence, however, the state procedural default rule is not a\nbar to a federal habeas corpus petition. See Schlup v.\nDelo, 513 U. S. 298, 319\u2013322 (1995). After careful review\nof the full record, we conclude that House has made the\nstringent showing required by this exception; and we hold\nthat his federal habeas action may proceed.\n                                         I\n  We begin with the facts surrounding Mrs. Muncey\u2019s\ndisappearance, the discovery of her body, and House\u2019s\n2                      HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\narrest. Around 3 p.m. on Sunday, July 14, 1985, two local\nresidents found her body concealed amid brush and tree\nbranches on an embankment roughly 100 yards up the\nroad from her driveway. Mrs. Muncey had been seen last\non the evening before, when, around 8 p.m., she and her\ntwo children\u2014Lora Muncey, age 10, and Matthew\nMuncey, age 8\u2014visited their neighbor, Pam Luttrell.\nAccording to Luttrell, Mrs. Muncey mentioned her hus\nband, William Hubert Muncey, Jr., known in the commu\nnity as \u201cLittle Hube\u201d and to his family as \u201cBubbie.\u201d As\nLuttrell recounted Mrs. Muncey\u2019s comment, Mr. Muncey\n\u201chad gone to dig a grave, and he hadn\u2019t come back, but\nthat was all right, because [Mrs. Muncey] was going to\nmake him take her fishing the next day,\u201d App. 11\u201312.\nMrs. Muncey returned home, and some time later, before\n11:00 p.m. at the latest, Luttrell \u201cheard a car rev its motor\nas it went down the road,\u201d something Mr. Muncey custom\narily did when he drove by on his way home. Record,\nAddendum 4, 5 Tr. of Evidence in No. 378 (Crim. Ct. Un\nion County, Tenn.) 641\u2013642 (hereinafter Tr.). Luttrell\nthen went to bed.\n  Around 1 a.m., Lora and Matthew returned to Luttrell\u2019s\nhome, this time with their father, Mr. Muncey, who said\nhis wife was missing. Muncey asked Luttrell to watch the\nchildren while he searched for his wife. After he left,\nLuttrell talked with Lora. According to Luttrell:\n    \u201c[Lora] said she heard a horn blow, she thought she\n    heard a horn blow, and somebody asked if Bubbie was\n    home, and her mama, you know, told them\u2014no. And\n    then she said she didn\u2019t know if she went back to\n    sleep or not, but then she heard her mama going down\n    the steps crying and I am not sure if that is when she\n    told me that she heard her mama say\u2014oh God, no,\n    not me, or if she told me that the next day, but I do\n    know that she said she heard her mother going down\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)          3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    the steps crying.\u201d App. 14\u201315.\nWhile Lora was talking, Luttrell recalled, \u201cMatt kept\nbutting in, you know, on us talking, and he said\u2014sister\nthey said daddy had a wreck, they said daddy had a\nwreck.\u201d Id., at 13.\n  At House\u2019s trial, Lora repeated her account of the\nnight\u2019s events, this time referring to the \u201cwreck\u201d her\nbrother had mentioned. To assist in understanding Lora\u2019s\naccount, it should be noted that Mrs. Muncey\u2019s father-in\nlaw\u2014Little Hube\u2019s father\u2014was sometimes called \u201cBig\nHube.\u201d Lora and her brother called him \u201cPaw Paw.\u201d We\nrefer to him as Mr. Muncey, Sr. According to Lora, Mr.\nMuncey, Sr. had a deep voice, as does petitioner House.\n  Lora testified that after leaving Luttrell\u2019s house with\nher mother, she and her brother \u201cwent to bed.\u201d Id., at 18.\nLater, she heard someone, or perhaps two different people,\nask for her mother. Lora\u2019s account of the events after she\nwent to bed was as follows:\n    \u201cQ Laura [sic], at some point after you got back home \n\n    and you went to bed, did anything happen that caused \n\n    your mother to be upset or did you hear anything?\n\n    \u201cA Well, it sounded like PawPaw said\u2014where\u2019s \n\n    daddy at, and she said digging a grave. \n\n    \u201cQ Okay. Do you know if it was PawPaw or not, or \n\n    did it sound like PawPaw? \n\n    \u201cA It just sounded like PawPaw.\n\n    \u201cQ And your mother told him what? \n\n    \u201cA That he was digging a grave. \n\n    \u201cQ Had you ever heard that voice before that said\n\n    that? \n\n    \u201cA I don\u2019t remember. \n\n    \u201cQ After that, at some point later, did you hear any\n\n    thing else that caused your mother to be upset?\n\n    \u201cA Well, they said that daddy had a wreck down the\n\n    road and she started crying\u2014next to the creek. \n\n4                     HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    \u201cQ Your mother started crying. What was it that\n\n    they said?\n\n    \u201cA That daddy had a wreck.\n\n    \u201cQ Did they say where? \n\n    \u201cA Down there next to the creek.\u201d Id., at 18\u201319. \n\nLora did not describe hearing any struggle. Some time\nlater, Lora and her brother left the house to look for their\nmother, but no one answered when they knocked at the\nLuttrells\u2019 home, and another neighbor, Mike Clinton, said\nhe had not seen her. After the children returned home,\naccording to Lora, her father came home and \u201cfixed him a\nbologna sandwich and he took a bit of it and he says\u2014\nsissy, where is mommy at, and I said\u2014she ain\u2019t been here\nfor a little while.\u201d Id., at 20. Lora recalled that Mr.\nMuncey went outside and, not seeing his wife, returned to\ntake Lora and Matthew to the Luttrells\u2019 so that he could\nlook further.\n   The next afternoon Billy Ray Hensley, the victim\u2019s first\ncousin, heard of Mrs. Muncey\u2019s disappearance and went to\nlook for Mr. Muncey. As he approached the Munceys\u2019\nstreet, Hensley allegedly \u201csaw Mr. House come out from\nunder a bank, wiping his hands on a black rag.\u201d Id., at 32.\nJust when and where Hensley saw House, and how well\nhe could have observed him, were disputed at House\u2019s\ntrial. Hensley admitted on cross-examination that he\ncould not have seen House \u201cwalking up or climbing up\u201d the\nembankment, id., at 39; rather, he saw House, in \u201c[j]ust a\nglance,\u201d id., at 40, \u201cappear out of nowhere,\u201d \u201cnext to the\nembankment,\u201d id., at 39. On the Munceys\u2019 street, opposite\nthe area where Hensley said he saw House, a white Ply\nmouth was parked near a sawmill. Another witness, Billy\nHankins, whom the defense called, claimed that around\nthe same time he saw a \u201cboy\u201d walking down the street\naway from the parked Plymouth and toward the Munceys\u2019\nhome. This witness, however, put the \u201cboy\u201d on the side of\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe street with the parked car and the Munceys\u2019 driveway,\nnot the side with the embankment.\n  Hensley, after turning onto the Munceys\u2019 street, contin\nued down the road and turned into their driveway. \u201cI\npulled up in the driveway where I could see up toward\nLittle Hube\u2019s house,\u201d Hensley testified, \u201cand I seen Little\nHube\u2019s car wasn\u2019t there, and I backed out in the road, and\ncome back [the other way].\u201d Id., at 32. As he traveled up\nthe road, Hensley saw House traveling in the opposite\ndirection in the white Plymouth. House \u201cflagged [Hensley]\ndown\u201d through his windshield, ibid., and the two cars met\nabout 300 feet up the road from the Munceys\u2019 driveway.\nAccording to Hensley, House said he had heard Mrs.\nMuncey was missing and was looking for her husband.\nId., at 33. Though House had only recently moved to the\narea, he was acquainted with the Munceys, had attended a\ndance with them, and had visited their home. He later\ntold law enforcement officials he considered both of the\nMunceys his friends. According to Hensley, House said he\nhad heard that Mrs. Muncey\u2019s husband, who was an alco\nholic, was elsewhere \u201cgetting drunk.\u201d Ibid.\n  As Hensley drove off, he \u201cgot to thinking to [him]self\u2014\nhe\u2019s hunting Little Hube, and Little Hube drunk\u2014what\nwould he be doing off that bank . . . .\u201d Ibid. His suspicion\naroused, Hensley later returned to the Munceys\u2019 street\nwith a friend named Jack Adkins. The two checked differ\nent spots on the embankment, and though Hensley saw\nnothing where he looked, Adkins found Mrs. Muncey. Her\nbody lay across from the sawmill near the corner where\nHouse\u2019s car had been parked, dumped in the woods a short\nway down the bank leading toward a creek.\n  Around midnight, Dr. Alex Carabia, a practicing pa\nthologist and county medical examiner, performed an\nautopsy. Dr. Carabia put the time of death between 9 and\n11 p.m. Mrs. Muncey had a black eye, both her hands\nwere bloodstained up to the wrists, and she had bruises on\n6                      HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nher legs and neck. Dr. Carabia described the bruises as\nconsistent with a \u201ctraumatic origin,\u201d i.e., a fight or a fall\non hard objects. 7 id., at 985\u2013986. Based on the neck\nbruises and other injuries, he concluded Mrs. Muncey had\nbeen choked, but he ruled this out as the cause of death.\nThe cause of death, in Dr. Carabia\u2019s view, was a severe\nblow to the left forehead that inflicted both a laceration\npenetrating to the bone and, inside the skull, a severe\nright-side hemorrhage, likely caused by Mrs. Muncey\u2019s\nbrain slamming into the skull opposite the impact. Dr.\nCarabia described this head injury as consistent either\nwith receiving a blow from a fist or other instrument or\nwith striking some object.\n   The county sheriff, informed about Hensley\u2019s earlier\nencounter with House, questioned House shortly after the\nbody was found. That evening, House answered further\nquestions during a voluntary interview at the local jail.\nSpecial Agent Ray Presnell of the Tennessee Bureau of\nInvestigation (TBI) prepared a statement of House\u2019s an\nswers, which House signed. Asked to describe his where\nabouts on the previous evening, House claimed\u2014falsely,\nas it turned out\u2014that he spent the entire evening with his\ngirlfriend, Donna Turner, at her trailer. Asked whether\nhe was wearing the same pants he had worn the night\nbefore, House replied\u2014again, falsely\u2014that he was. House\nwas on probation at the time, having recently been re\nleased on parole following a sentence of five years to life\nfor aggravated sexual assault in Utah.           House had\nscratches on his arms and hands, and a knuckle on his\nright ring finger was bruised. He attributed the scratches\nto Turner\u2019s cats and the finger injury to recent construc\ntion work tearing down a shed. The next day House gave\na similar statement to a different TBI agent, Charles\nScott.\n   In fact House had not been at Turner\u2019s home. After\ninitially supporting House\u2019s alibi, Turner informed au\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthorities that House left her trailer around 10:30 or 10:45\np.m. to go for a walk. According to Turner\u2019s trial testi\nmony, House returned later\u2014she was not sure when\u2014hot\nand panting, missing his shirt and his shoes. House,\nTurner testified, told her that while he was walking on the\nroad near her home, a vehicle pulled up beside him, and\nsomebody inside \u201ccalled him some names and then they\ntold him he didn\u2019t belong here anymore.\u201d App. 89. House\nsaid he tried to ignore the taunts and keep walking, but\nthe vehicle pulled in behind him, and \u201cone of them got out\nand grabbed him by the shoulder . . . and [House] swung\naround with his right hand\u201d and \u201chit something.\u201d Ibid.\nAccording to Turner, House said \u201che took off down the\nbank and started running and he said that he\u2014he said it\nseemed forever where he was running. And he said they\nfired two shots at him while he took off down the bank\n. . . .\u201d Ibid. House claimed the assailants \u201cgrabbed ahold\nof his shirt,\u201d which Turner remembered as \u201ca blue tank\ntop, trimmed in yellow,\u201d and \u201cthey tore it to where it\nwouldn\u2019t stay on him and he said\u2014I just throwed it off\nwhen I was running.\u201d Id., at 91. Turner, noticing House\u2019s\nbruised knuckle, asked how he hurt it, and House told her\n\u201cthat\u2019s where he hit.\u201d Id., at 90. Turner testified that she\n\u201cthought maybe my ex-husband had something to do with\nit.\u201d Ibid.\n    Although the white Plymouth House drove the next day\nbelonged to Turner, Turner insisted House had not used\nthe car that night. No forensic evidence connected the car\nto the crime; law enforcement officials inspected a white\ntowel covering the driver seat and concluded it was clean.\nTurner\u2019s trailer was located just under two miles by road,\nthrough hilly terrain, from the Muncey residence.\n    Law enforcement officers also questioned the victim\u2019s\nhusband. Though Mrs. Muncey\u2019s comments to Luttrell\ngave no indication she knew this, Mr. Muncey had spent\nthe evening at a weekly dance at a recreation center\n8                     HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nroughly a mile and a half from his home. In his statement\nto law enforcement\u2014a statement House\u2019s trial counsel\nclaims he never saw\u2014Mr. Muncey admitted leaving the\ndance early, but said it was only for a brief trip to the\npackage store to buy beer. He also stated that he and his\nwife had had sexual relations Saturday morning.\n  Late in the evening on Monday, July 15\u2014two days after\nthe murder\u2014law enforcement officers visited Turner\u2019s\ntrailer. With Turner\u2019s consent, Agent Scott seized the\npants House was wearing the night Mrs. Muncey disap\npeared. The heavily soiled pants were sitting in a laundry\nhamper; years later, Agent Scott recalled noticing \u201creddish\nbrown stains\u201d he \u201csuspected\u201d were blood. Id., at 274\u2013275.\nAround 4 p.m. the next day, two local law enforcement\nofficers set out for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in\nWashington, D. C., with House\u2019s pants, blood samples\nfrom the autopsy, and other evidence packed together in a\nbox. They arrived at 2:00 a.m. the next morning. On July\n17, after initial FBI testing revealed human blood on the\npants, House was arrested.\n                               II\n  The State of Tennessee charged House with capital\nmurder. At House\u2019s trial, the State presented testimony\nby Luttrell, Hensley, Adkins, Lora Muncey, Dr. Carabia,\nthe sheriff, and other law enforcement officials. Through\nTBI Agents Presnell and Scott, the jury learned of House\u2019s\nfalse statements. Central to the State\u2019s case, however,\nwas what the FBI testing showed\u2014that semen consistent\n(or so it seemed) with House\u2019s was present on Mrs.\nMuncey\u2019s nightgown and panties, and that small blood\nstains consistent with Mrs. Muncey\u2019s blood but not\nHouse\u2019s appeared on the jeans belonging to House.\n  Regarding the semen, FBI Special Agent Paul Bigbee, a\nserologist, testified that the source was a \u201csecretor,\u201d mean\ning someone who \u201csecrete[s] the ABO blood group sub\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstances in other body fluids, such as semen and saliva\u201d\u2014a\ncharacteristic shared by 80 percent of the population,\nincluding House. Id., at 55. Agent Bigbee further testified\nthat the source of semen on the gown was blood-type A,\nHouse\u2019s own blood type. As to the semen on the panties,\nAgent Bigbee found only the H blood-group substance,\nwhich A and B blood-type secretors secrete along with\nsubstances A and B, and which O-type secretors secrete\nexclusively.     Agent Bigbee explained, however\u2014using\nscience an amicus here sharply disputes, see Brief for\nInnocence Project, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 24\u201326\u2014that\nHouse\u2019s A antigens could have \u201cdegraded\u201d into H, App. 57\u2013\n58. Agent Bigbee thus concluded that both semen deposits\ncould have come from House, though he acknowledged\nthat that the H antigen could have come from Mrs.\nMuncey herself if she was a secretor\u2014something he \u201cwas\nnot able to determine,\u201d id., at 58\u2014and that, while Mr.\nMuncey was himself blood-type A (as was his wife), Agent\nBigbee was again \u201cnot able to determine his secretor\nstatus,\u201d id., at 57. Agent Bigbee acknowledged on cross-\nexamination that \u201ca saliva sample\u201d would have sufficed to\ndetermine whether Mr. Muncey was a secretor; the State\ndid not provide such a sample, though it did provide sam\nples of Mr. Muncey\u2019s blood. Id., at 62.\n  As for the blood, Agent Bigbee explained that \u201cspots of\nblood\u201d appeared \u201con the left outside leg, the right bottom\ncuff, on the left thigh and in the right inside pocket and on\nthe lower pocket on the outside.\u201d Id., at 48. Agent Bigbee\ndetermined that the blood\u2019s source was type A (the type\nshared by House, the victim, and Mr. Muncey). He also\nsuccessfully tested for the enzyme phosphoglucomutase\nand the blood serum haptoglobin, both of which \u201care found\nin all humans\u201d and carry \u201cslight chemical differences\u201d that\nvary genetically and \u201ccan be grouped to differentiate\nbetween two individuals if those types are different.\u201d Id.,\nat 49\u201350. Based on these chemical traces and on the A\n10                     HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nblood type, Agent Bigbee determined that only some 6.75\npercent of the population carry similar blood, that the\nblood was \u201cconsistent\u201d with Mrs. Muncey\u2019s (as determined\nby testing autopsy samples), and that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d\nthat the blood came from House. Id., at 48\u201352.\n  A different FBI expert, Special Agent Chester Blythe,\ntestified about fiber analysis performed on Mrs. Muncey\u2019s\nclothes and on House\u2019s pants. Although Agent Blythe\nfound blue jean fibers on Mrs. Muncey\u2019s nightgown, brass\nier, housecoat, and panties, and in fingernail scrapings\ntaken from her body (scrapings that also contained trace,\nunidentifiable amounts of blood), he acknowledged that, as\nthe prosecutor put it in questioning the witness, \u201cblue jean\nmaterial is common material,\u201d so \u201cthis doesn\u2019t mean that\nthe fibers that were all over the victim\u2019s clothing were\nnecessarily from [House\u2019s] pair of blue jeans.\u201d 6 Tr. 864\u2013865.\nOn House\u2019s pants, though cotton garments both transfer\nand retain fibers readily, Agent Blythe found neither hair\nnor fiber consistent with the victim\u2019s hair or clothing.\n  In the defense case House called Hankins, Clinton, and\nTurner, as well as House\u2019s mother, who testified that\nHouse had talked to her by telephone around 9:30 p.m. on\nthe night of the murder and that he had not used her car\nthat evening. House also called the victim\u2019s brother, Ricky\nGreen, as a witness. Green testified that on July 2, roughly\ntwo weeks before the murder, Mrs. Muncey called him and\n\u201csaid her and Little Hube had been into it and she said she\nwas wanting to leave Little Hube, she said she was want\ning to get out\u2014out of it, and she was scared.\u201d 7 id., at\n1088. Green recalled that at Christmastime in 1982 he\nhad seen Mr. Muncey strike Mrs. Muncey after returning\nhome drunk.\n  As Turner informed the jury, House\u2019s shoes were found\nseveral months after the crime in a field near her home.\nTurner delivered them to authorities. Though the jury did\nnot learn of this fact (and House\u2019s counsel claims he did\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot either), the State tested the shoes for blood and found\nnone. House\u2019s shirt was not found.\n  The State\u2019s closing argument suggested that on the\nnight of her murder, Mrs. Muncey \u201cwas deceived . . . . She\nhad been told [her husband] had had an accident.\u201d 9 id.,\nat 1226. The prosecutor emphasized the FBI\u2019s blood\nanalysis, noting that \u201cafter running many, many, many\ntests,\u201d Agent Bigbee:\n    \u201cwas able to tell you that the blood on the defendant\u2019s\n    blue jeans was not his own blood, could not be his own\n    blood. He told you that the blood on the blue jeans\n    was consistent with every characteristic in every re\n    spect of the deceased\u2019s, Carolyn Muncey\u2019s, and that\n    ninety-three (93%) percent of the white population\n    would not have that blood type. . . . He can\u2019t tell you\n    one hundred (100%) percent for certain that it was her\n    blood. But folks, he can sure give you a pretty good\u2014\n    a pretty good indication.\u201d Id., at 1235\u20131236.\n  In the State\u2019s rebuttal, after defense counsel questioned\nHouse\u2019s motive \u201cto go over and kill a woman that he barely\nknew[,] [w]ho was still dressed, still clad in her clothes,\u201d\nId., at 1274, the prosecutor referred obliquely to the semen\nstains. While explaining that legally \u201cit does not make\nany difference under God\u2019s heaven, what the motive was,\u201d\nApp. 106, the prosecutor told the jury, \u201cyou may have an\nidea why he did it,\u201d ibid.:\n    \u201cThe evidence at the scene which seemed to suggest\n    that he was subjecting this lady to some kind of in\n    dignity, why would you get a lady out of her house,\n    late at night, in her night clothes, under the trick that\n    her husband has had a wreck down by the creek? . . .\n    Well, it is because either you don\u2019t want her to tell\n    what indignities you have subjected her to, or she is\n    unwilling and fights against you, against being sub\n    jected to those indignities. In other words, it is either\n12                     HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n     to keep her from telling what you have done to her, or\n     it is that you are trying to get her to do something\n     that she nor any mother on that road would want to\n     do with Mr. House, under those conditions, and you\n     kill her because of her resistance. That is what the\n     evidence at the scene suggests about motive.\u201d Id., at\n     106\u2013107.\nIn addition the government suggested the black rag\nHensley said he saw in House\u2019s hands was in fact the\nmissing blue tank top, retrieved by House from the crime\nscene. And the prosecution reiterated the importance of\nthe blood. \u201c[D]efense counsel,\u201d he said, \u201cdoes not start out\ndiscussing the fact that his client had blood on his jeans on\nthe night that Carolyn Muncey was killed. . . . He doesn\u2019t\nstart with the fact that nothing that the defense has in\ntroduced in this case explains what blood is doing on his\njeans, all over his jeans, that is scientifically, completely\ndifferent from his blood.\u201d Id., at 104\u2013105. The jury found\nHouse guilty of murder in the first degree.\n  The trial advanced to the sentencing phase. As aggra\nvating factors to support a capital sentence, the State\nsought to prove: (1) that House had previously been con\nvicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence;\n(2) that the homicide was especially heinous, atrocious, or\ncruel in that it involved torture or depravity of mind; and\n(3) that the murder was committed while House was\ncommitting, attempting to commit, or fleeing from the\ncommission of, rape or kidnaping. See Tenn. Code Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a739\u20132\u2013203(i)(2), (5), (7) (1982) (repealed 1989); compare\n\u00a7\u00a739\u201313\u2013204(i)(2), (5), (7) (2003). After presenting evi\ndence of House\u2019s parole status and aggravated sexual\nassault conviction, the State rested. As mitigation, the\ndefense offered testimony from House\u2019s father and mother,\nas well as evidence, presented through House\u2019s mother,\nthat House attempted suicide after the guilt-phase verdict.\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBefore the attempt House wrote his mother a letter pro\nfessing his innocence.\n  In closing the State urged the jury to find all three\naggravating factors and impose death. As to the kidnap\ning or rape factor, the prosecution suggested Mrs. Muncey\nwas \u201cdecoy[ed] or entic[ed] . . . away from her family, and\nconfin[ed] her against her will because you know that as\nshe was being beaten to death.\u201d 10 Tr. 1410. \u201cWe also\nthink,\u201d the prosecutor added, \u201cthe proof shows strong\nevidence of attempted sexual molestation of the victim to\naccompany the taking away and murdering her.\u201d Id., at\n1410\u20131411. Later the prosecutor argued, \u201cI think the\nproof shows in the record that it is more likely than not\nthat having been through the process before and having\nbeen convicted of a crime involving the threat of violence,\nor violence to another person, aggravated sexual assault,\nthat the defendant cannot benefit from the type of reha\nbilitation that correction departments can provide.\u201d Id., at\n1413. The jury unanimously found all three aggravating\nfactors and concluded \u201cthere are no mitigating circum\nstances sufficiently substantial to outweigh the statutory\naggravating circumstance or circumstances.\u201d Id., at1454.\nThe jury recommended a death sentence, which the trial\njudge imposed.\n                             III\n   The Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed House\u2019s convic\ntion and sentence, describing the evidence against House\nas \u201ccircumstantial\u201d but \u201cquite strong.\u201d State v. House, 743\nS. W. 2d 141, 143, 144 (1987). Two months later, in a state\ntrial court, House filed a pro se petition for postconviction\nrelief, arguing he received ineffective assistance of counsel\nat trial. The court appointed counsel, who amended the\npetition to raise other issues, including a challenge to\ncertain jury instructions. At a hearing before the same\njudge who conducted the trial, House\u2019s counsel offered no\n14                     HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nproof beyond the trial transcript. The trial court dis\nmissed the petition, deeming House\u2019s trial counsel ade\nquate and overruling House\u2019s other objections. On appeal\nHouse\u2019s attorney renewed only the jury-instructions ar\ngument. In an unpublished opinion the Tennessee Court\nof Criminal Appeals affirmed, and both the Tennessee\nSupreme Court and this Court, House v. Tennessee, 498\nU. S. 912 (1990), denied review.\n   House filed a second postconviction petition in state court\nreasserting his ineffective-assistance claim and seeking\ninvestigative and/or expert assistance. After extensive\nlitigation regarding whether House\u2019s claims were proce\ndurally defaulted the Tennessee Supreme Court held that\nHouse\u2019s claims were barred under a state statute provid\ning that claims not raised in prior postconviction proceed\nings are presumptively waived, Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a740\u201330\u2013\n112 (1990) (repealed 1995), and that courts may not con\nsider grounds for relief \u201cwhich the court finds should be\nexcluded because they have been waived or previously\ndetermined,\u201d \u00a740\u201330\u2013111 (repealed 1995). See House v.\nState, 911 S. W. 2d 705 (Tenn. 1995). This Court denied\ncertiorari. House v. Tennessee, 517 U. S. 1193 (1996).\n   House next sought federal habeas relief, asserting nu\nmerous claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and\nprosecutorial misconduct. The United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Tennessee, though deem\ning House\u2019s claims procedurally defaulted and granting\nsummary judgment to the State on the majority of House\u2019s\nclaims, held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether\nHouse fell within the \u201cactual innocence\u201d exception to\nprocedural default that this Court recognized as to sub\nstantive offenses in Schlup and as to death sentences in\nSawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333 (1992). Presenting evi\ndence we describe in greater detail below, House attacked\nthe semen and blood evidence used at his trial and pre\nsented other evidence, including a putative confession,\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsuggesting that Mr. Muncey, not House, committed the\nmurder. The District Court nevertheless denied relief,\nholding that House had neither demonstrated actual\ninnocence of the murder under Schlup nor established\nthat he was ineligible for the death penalty under Sawyer.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted a\ncertificate of appealability under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72253(c) as to\nall claims in the habeas petition. On the merits a divided\npanel affirmed, but its opinion was withdrawn and the\ncase taken en banc. A divided en banc court certified\nstate-law questions to the Tennessee Supreme Court.\nHouse v. Bell, 311 F. 3d 767 (CA6 2002). Concluding that\nHouse had made a compelling showing of actual inno\ncence, and recognizing that in Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S.\n390 (1993), this Court assumed without deciding that \u201cin a\ncapital case a truly persuasive demonstration of \u2018actual\ninnocence\u2019 made after trial would render the execution of a\ndefendant unconstitutional, and warrant federal habeas\nrelief if there were no state avenue open to process such a\nclaim,\u201d id., at 417, the six-judge majority certified ques\ntions to the State Supreme Court, 311 F. 3d, at 777\u2013778.\nThe questions sought \u201cto ascertain whether there remains\na \u2018state avenue open to process such a claim\u2019 in this case.\u201d\nId., at 768. Four dissenting judges argued the court\nshould have reached the merits, rather than certifying\nquestions to the state court; these judges asserted that\nHouse could not obtain relief under Schlup, let alone\nSawyer and Herrera. 311 F. 3d, at 780\u2013781 (Boggs, J., dis\nsenting). A fifth dissenter explained that while he agreed\nwith the majority that House \u201cpresents a strong claim for\nhabeas relief, at least at the sentencing phase of the case,\u201d\nhe objected to the certification of questions to the Tennes\nsee high court. Id., at 787 (opinion of Gilman, J.). This\nCourt denied certiorari. Bell v. House, 539 U. S. 937\n(2003).\n   The State urged the Tennessee Supreme Court not to\n16                     HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nanswer the Court of Appeals\u2019 certified questions, and the\nstate court did not do so. The case returned to the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. This time\nan eight-judge majority affirmed the District Court\u2019s\ndenial of habeas relief. 386 F. 3d 668 (2004). Six dissent\ners argued that House not only had met the actual inno\ncence standard for overcoming procedural default but also\nwas entitled to immediate release under Herrera. 386\nF. 3d, at 708 (Merritt, J., dissenting). A seventh dissenter\n(the same judge who wrote separately in the previous en\nbanc decision) described the case as \u201ca real-life murder\nmystery, an authentic \u2018who-done-it\u2019 where the wrong man\nmay be executed.\u201d Id., at 709 (opinion of Gilman, J.). He\nconcluded such grave uncertainty necessitated relief in the\nform of a new trial for House. Id., at 710.\n  We granted certiorari, 545 U. S. ___ (2005), and now\nreverse.\n                               IV\n    As a general rule, claims forfeited under state law may\nsupport federal habeas relief only if the prisoner demon\nstrates cause for the default and prejudice from the as\nserted error. See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 485\n(1986); Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 129 (1982); Wain\nwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 87 (1977). The rule is based\non the comity and respect that must be accorded to state-\ncourt judgments. See, e.g., Engle, supra, at 126\u2013129;\nWainwright, supra, at 89\u201390. The bar is not, however,\nunqualified. In an effort to \u201cbalance the societal interests\nin finality, comity, and conservation of scarce judicial\nresources with the individual interest in justice that arises\nin the extraordinary case,\u201d Schlup, 513 U. S., at 324, the\nCourt has recognized a miscarriage-of-justice exception.\n\u201c \u2018[I]n appropriate cases,\u2019 \u201d the Court has said, \u201cthe princi\nples of comity and finality that inform the concepts of\ncause and prejudice \u2018must yield to the imperative of cor\n                  Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrecting a fundamentally unjust incarceration,\u2019 \u201d Carrier,\nsupra, at 495 (quoting Engle, supra, at 135).\n   In Schlup, the Court adopted a specific rule to imple\nment this general principle. It held that prisoners assert\ning innocence as a gateway to defaulted claims must\nestablish that, in light of new evidence, \u201cit is more likely\nthan not that no reasonable juror would have found peti\ntioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 513 U. S., at\n327. This formulation, Schlup explains, \u201censures that\npetitioner\u2019s case is truly \u2018extraordinary,\u2019 while still provid\ning petitioner a meaningful avenue by which to avoid a\nmanifest injustice.\u201d Ibid. (quoting McCleskey v. Zant, 499\nU. S. 467, 494 (1991)). In the usual case the presumed\nguilt of a prisoner convicted in state court counsels against\nfederal review of defaulted claims. Yet a petition sup\nported by a convincing Schlup gateway showing \u201craise[s]\nsufficient doubt about [the petitioner\u2019s] guilt to undermine\nconfidence in the result of the trial without the assurance\nthat that trial was untainted by constitutional error\u201d;\nhence, \u201ca review of the merits of the constitutional claims\u201d\nis justified. 513 U. S., at 317.\n   For purposes of this case several features of the Schlup\nstandard bear emphasis. First, although \u201c[t]o be credible\u201d\na gateway claim requires \u201cnew reliable evidence\u2014whether\nit be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy eyewit\nness accounts, or critical physical evidence\u2014that was not\npresented at trial,\u201d id., at 324, the habeas court\u2019s analysis\nis not limited to such evidence. There is no dispute in this\ncase that House has presented some new reliable evidence;\nthe State has conceded as much, see infra, at 20\u201321. In\naddition, because the District Court held an evidentiary\nhearing in this case, and because the State does not chal\nlenge the court\u2019s decision to do so, we have no occasion to\nelaborate on Schlup\u2019s observation that when considering\nan actual-innocence claim in the context of a request for\nan evidentiary hearing, the District Court need not \u201ctest\n18                    HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe new evidence by a standard appropriate for deciding a\nmotion for summary judgment,\u201d but rather may \u201cconsider\nhow the timing of the submission and the likely credibility\nof the affiants bear on the probable reliability of that\nevidence.\u201d 513 U. S., at 331\u2013332. Our review in this case\naddresses the merits of the Schlup inquiry, based on a\nfully developed record, and with respect to that inquiry\nSchlup makes plain that the habeas court must consider\n\u201c \u2018all the evidence,\u2019 \u201d old and new, incriminating and excul\npatory, without regard to whether it would necessarily be\nadmitted under \u201crules of admissibility that would govern\nat trial.\u201d See id., at 327\u2013328 (quoting Friendly, Is Inno\ncence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack on Criminal Judg\nments, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev. 142, 160 (1970)). Based on this\ntotal record, the court must make \u201ca probabilistic deter\nmination about what reasonable, properly instructed\njurors would do.\u201d 513 U. S., at 329. The court\u2019s function is\nnot to make an independent factual determination about\nwhat likely occurred, but rather to assess the likely impact\nof the evidence on reasonable jurors. Ibid.\n    Second, it bears repeating that the Schlup standard is\ndemanding and permits review only in the \u201c \u2018extraordi\nnary\u2019 \u201d case. Id., at 327 (quoting Zant, supra, at 494); see\nalso 513 U. S., at 324 (emphasizing that \u201cin the vast ma\njority of cases, claims of actual innocence are rarely suc\ncessful\u201d). At the same time, though, the Schlup standard\ndoes not require absolute certainty about the petitioner\u2019s\nguilt or innocence. A petitioner\u2019s burden at the gateway\nstage is to demonstrate that more likely than not, in light\nof the new evidence, no reasonable juror would find him\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014or, to remove the dou\nble negative, that more likely than not any reasonable\njuror would have reasonable doubt.\n    Finally, as the Schlup decision explains, the gateway\nactual-innocence standard is \u201cby no means equivalent to\nthe standard of Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979),\u201d\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich governs claims of insufficient evidence. Id., at 330.\nWhen confronted with a challenge based on trial evidence,\ncourts presume the jury resolved evidentiary disputes\nreasonably so long as sufficient evidence supports the\nverdict. Because a Schlup claim involves evidence the\ntrial jury did not have before it, the inquiry requires the\nfederal court to assess how reasonable jurors would react\nto the overall, newly supplemented record. See ibid. If\nnew evidence so requires, this may include consideration\nof \u201cthe credibility of the witnesses presented at trial.\u201d\nIbid.; see also ibid. (noting that \u201c[i]n such a case,\nthe habeas court may have to make some credibility\nassessments\u201d).\n   As an initial matter, the State argues that the Antiter\nrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA),\n110 Stat. 1214, has replaced the Schlup standard with a\nstricter test based on Sawyer, which permits consideration\nof successive, abusive, or defaulted sentencing-related\nclaims only if the petitioner \u201cshow[s] by clear and convinc\ning evidence that, but for a constitutional error, no reason\nable juror would have found the petitioner eligible for the\ndeath penalty under the applicable state law,\u201d 505 U. S., at\n336. One AEDPA provision establishes a similar standard\nfor second or successive petitions involving no retroactively\napplicable new law, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(b)(2)(B)(ii); another\nsets it as a threshold for obtaining an evidentiary hearing\non claims the petitioner failed to develop in state court,\n\u00a72254(e)(2). Neither provision addresses the type of peti\ntion at issue here\u2014a first federal habeas petition seeking\nconsideration of defaulted claims based on a showing of\nactual innocence. Thus, the standard of review in these\nprovisions is inapplicable. Cf. Lonchar v. Thomas, 517\nU. S. 314, 324 (1996) (\u201c[D]ismissal of a first federal habeas\npetition is a particularly serious matter\u201d).\n   The State also argues that the District Court\u2019s findings\nin this case tie our hands, precluding a ruling in House\u2019s\n20                      HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfavor absent a showing of clear error as to the District\nCourt\u2019s specific determinations. This view overstates the\neffect of the District Court\u2019s ruling. Deference is given to a\ntrial court\u2019s assessment of evidence presented to it in the\nfirst instance. Yet the Schlup inquiry, we repeat, requires\na holistic judgment about \u201c \u2018all the evidence,\u2019 \u201d 513 U. S., at\n328 (quoting Friendly, supra, at 160), and its likely effect\non reasonable jurors applying the reasonable-doubt stan\ndard. As a general rule, the inquiry does not turn on\ndiscrete findings regarding disputed points of fact, and\n\u201c[i]t is not the district court\u2019s independent judgment as to\nwhether reasonable doubt exists that the standard ad\ndresses,\u201d 513 U. S., at 329. Here, although the District\nCourt attentively managed complex proceedings, carefully\nreviewed the extensive record, and drew certain conclu\nsions about the evidence, the court did not clearly apply\nSchlup\u2019s predictive standard regarding whether reason\nable jurors would have reasonable doubt. As we shall\nexplain, moreover, we are uncertain about the basis for\nsome of the District Court\u2019s conclusions\u2014a consideration\nthat weakens our reliance on its determinations.\n   With this background in mind we turn to the evidence\ndeveloped in House\u2019s federal habeas proceedings.\n                        DNA Evidence\n   First, in direct contradiction of evidence presented at\ntrial, DNA testing has established that the semen on Mrs.\nMuncey\u2019s nightgown and panties came from her husband,\nMr. Muncey, not from House. The State, though conced\ning this point, insists this new evidence is immaterial. At\nthe guilt phase at least, neither sexual contact nor motive\nwere elements of the offense, so in the State\u2019s view the\nevidence, or lack of evidence, of sexual assault or sexual\nadvance is of no consequence. We disagree. In fact we\nconsider the new disclosure of central importance.\n   From beginning to end the case is about who committed\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe crime. When identity is in question, motive is key.\nThe point, indeed, was not lost on the prosecution, for it\nintroduced the evidence and relied on it in the final guilt-\nphase closing argument. Referring to \u201cevidence at the\nscene,\u201d the prosecutor suggested that House committed, or\nattempted to commit, some \u201cindignity\u201d on Mrs. Muncey\nthat neither she \u201cnor any mother on that road would want\nto do with Mr. House.\u201d 9 Tr. 1302\u20131303. Particularly in a\ncase like this where the proof was, as the State Supreme\nCourt observed, circumstantial, State v. House, 743 S. W.\n2d, at 143, 144, we think a jury would have given this\nevidence great weight. Quite apart from providing proof of\nmotive, it was the only forensic evidence at the scene that\nwould link House to the murder.\n   Law and society, as they ought to do, demand account\nability when a sexual offense has been committed, so not\nonly did this evidence link House to the crime; it likely\nwas a factor in persuading the jury not to let him go free.\nAt sentencing, moreover, the jury came to the unanimous\nconclusion, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the murder\nwas committed in the course of a rape or kidnaping. The\nalleged sexual motivation relates to both those determina\ntions. This is particularly so given that, at the sentencing\nphase, the jury was advised that House had a previous\nconviction for sexual assault.\n   A jury informed that fluids on Mrs. Muncey\u2019s garments\ncould have come from House might have found that House\ntrekked the nearly two miles to the victim\u2019s home and\nlured her away in order to commit a sexual offense. By\ncontrast a jury acting without the assumption that the\nsemen could have come from House would have found it\nnecessary to establish some different motive, or, if the\nsame motive, an intent far more speculative. When the\nonly direct evidence of sexual assault drops out of the case,\nso, too, does a central theme in the State\u2019s narrative link\ning House to the crime. In that light, furthermore,\n22                     HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nHouse\u2019s odd evening walk and his false statements to\nauthorities, while still potentially incriminating, might\nappear less suspicious.\n                         Bloodstains\n  The other relevant forensic evidence is the blood on\nHouse\u2019s pants, which appears in small, even minute,\nstains in scattered places. As the prosecutor told the jury,\nthey were stains that, due to their small size, \u201cyou or I\nmight not detect[,] [m]ight not see, but which the FBI lab\nwas able to find on [House\u2019s] jeans.\u201d App. 11. The stains\nappear inside the right pocket, outside that pocket, near\nthe inside button, on the left thigh and outside leg, on the\nseat of the pants, and on the right bottom cuff, including\ninside the pants. Due to testing by the FBI, cuttings now\nappear on the pants in several places where stains evi\ndently were found. (The cuttings were destroyed in the\ntesting process, and defense experts were unable to repli\ncate the tests.) At trial, the government argued \u201cnothing\nthat the defense has introduced in this case explains what\nblood is doing on his jeans, all over [House\u2019s] jeans, that is\nscientifically, completely different from his blood.\u201d Id., at\n105. House, though not disputing at this point that the\nblood is Mrs. Muncey\u2019s, now presents an alternative ex\nplanation that, if credited, would undermine the probative\nvalue of the blood evidence.\n  During House\u2019s habeas proceedings, Dr. Cleland Blake,\nan Assistant Chief Medical Examiner for the State of\nTennessee and a consultant in forensic pathology to the\nTBI for 22 years, testified that the blood on House\u2019s pants\nwas chemically too degraded, and too similar to blood\ncollected during the autopsy, to have come from Mrs.\nMuncey\u2019s body on the night of the crime. The blood sam\nples collected during the autopsy were placed in test tubes\nwithout preservative. Under such conditions, according to\nDr. Blake, \u201cyou will have enzyme degradation. You will\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhave different blood group degradation, blood marker deg\nradation.\u201d Record, Doc. 275, p. 80 (hereinafter R275:80).\nThe problem of decay, moreover, would have been com\npounded by the body\u2019s long exposure to the elements,\nsitting outside for the better part of a summer day. In\ncontrast, if blood is preserved on cloth, \u201cit will stay there\nfor years,\u201d ibid.; indeed, Dr. Blake said he deliberately\nplaces blood drops on gauze during autopsies to preserve it\nfor later testing. The blood on House\u2019s pants, judging by\nAgent Bigbee\u2019s tests, showed \u201csimilar deterioration,\nbreakdown of certain of the named numbered enzymes\u201d as\nin the autopsy samples. Id., at 110. \u201c[I]f the victim\u2019s blood\nhad spilled on the jeans while the victim was alive and\nthis blood had dried,\u201d Dr. Blake stated, \u201cthe deterioration\nwould not have occurred,\u201d ibid., and \u201cyou would expect\n[the blood on the jeans] to be different than what was in\nthe tube,\u201d id., at 113. Dr. Blake thus concluded the blood\non the jeans came from the autopsy samples, not from\nMrs. Muncey\u2019s live (or recently killed) body.\n   Other evidence confirms that blood did in fact spill from\nthe vials. It appears the vials passed from Dr. Carabia,\nwho performed the autopsy, into the hands of two local\nlaw enforcement officers, who transported it to the FBI,\nwhere Agent Bigbee performed the enzyme tests. The\nblood was contained in four vials, evidently with neither\npreservative nor a proper seal. The vials, in turn, were\nstored in a styrofoam box, but nothing indicates the box\nwas kept cool. Rather, in what an evidence protocol expert\nat the habeas hearing described as a violation of proper\nprocedure, the styrofoam box was packed in the same\ncardboard box as other evidence including House\u2019s pants\n(apparently in a paper bag) and other clothing (in separate\nbags). The cardboard box was then carried in the officers\u2019\ncar while they made the 10-hour journey from Tennessee\nto the FBI lab. Dr. Blake stated that blood vials in hot\nconditions (such as a car trunk in the summer) could blow\n24                     HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nopen; and in fact, by the time the blood reached the FBI it\nhad hemolyzed, or spoiled, due to heat exposure. By the\ntime the blood passed from the FBI to a defense expert,\nroughly a vial and a half were empty, though Agent Big-\nbee testified he used at most a quarter of one vial. Blood,\nmoreover, had seeped onto one corner of the styrofoam box\nand onto packing gauze inside the box below the vials.\n   In addition, although the pants apparently were pack\naged initially in a paper bag and FBI records suggest they\narrived at the FBI in one, the record does not contain the\npaper bag but does contain a plastic bag with a label\nlisting the pants and Agent Scott\u2019s name\u2014and the plastic\nbag has blood on it. The blood appears in a forked streak\nroughly five inches long and two inches wide running\ndown the bag\u2019s outside front. Though testing by House\u2019s\nexpert confirmed the stain was blood, the expert could not\ndetermine the blood\u2019s source. Speculations about when\nand how the blood got there add to the confusion regarding\nthe origins of the stains on House\u2019s pants.\n   Faced with these indications of, at best, poor evidence\ncontrol, the State attempted to establish at the habeas\nhearing that all blood spillage occurred after Agent Bigbee\nexamined the pants. Were that the case, of course, then\nblood would have been detected on the pants before any\nspill\u2014which would tend to undermine Dr. Blake\u2019s analysis\nand support using the bloodstains to infer House\u2019s guilt.\nIn support of this theory the State put on testimony by a\nblood spatter expert who believed the \u201cmajority\u201d of the\nstains were \u201ctransfer stains,\u201d that is, stains resulting from\n\u201cwip[ing] across the surface of the pants\u201d rather than\nseeping or spillage. App. 293\u2013294. Regarding the spillage\nin the styrofoam box, the expert noted that yellow \u201cTennes\nsee Crime Laboratory\u201d tape running around the box and\ndown all four sides did not line up when the bloodstains on\nthe box\u2019s corner were aligned. The inference was that the\nFBI received the box from Tennessee authorities, opened it,\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)          25\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand resealed it before the spillage occurred. Reinforcing\nthis theory, Agent Bigbee testified that he observed no\nblood spillage in the styrofoam box and that had he de\ntected such signs of evidence contamination, FBI policy\nwould have required immediate return of the evidence.\n   In response House argued that even assuming the tape\nalignment showed spillage occurring after FBI testing,\nspillage on one or more earlier occasions was likely. In\nfact even the State\u2019s spatter expert declined to suggest the\nblood in the box and on the packing gauze accounted for\nthe full vial and a quarter missing. And when the defense\nexpert opened the box and discovered the spills, the bulk\nof the blood-caked gauze was located around and under\nneath the half-full vial, which was also located near the\nstained corner. No gauze immediately surrounding the\ncompletely empty vial was stained. The tape, moreover,\ncircled the box in two layers, one underneath the other,\nand in one spot the underlying layer stops cleanly at the\nlid\u2019s edge, as if cut with a razor, and does not continue\nonto the body of the box below. In House\u2019s view this clean\ncut suggests the double layers could not have resulted\nsimply from wrapping the tape around twice, as the spat\nter expert claimed; rather, someone possessing Tennessee\nCrime Lab tape\u2014perhaps the officers transporting the\nblood and pants\u2014must have cut the box open and resealed\nit, possibly creating an opportunity for spillage. Support\ning the same inference, a label on the box\u2019s lid lists both\nblood and vaginal secretions as the box\u2019s contents, though\nAgent Bigbee\u2019s records show the vaginal fluids arrived at\nthe FBI in a separate envelope.             Finally, cross-\nexamination revealed that Agent Bigbee\u2019s practice did not\nalways match the letter of FBI policy. Although Mrs.\nMuncey\u2019s bra and housecoat were packed together in a\nsingle bag, creating, according to Agent Bigbee, a risk of\n\u201ccross contamination,\u201d id., at 286, he did not return them;\nnor did he note the discrepancy between the \u201c[b]lood and\n26                    HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n[v]aginal secretions\u201d label and the styrofoam box\u2019s actual\ncontents, though he insisted his customary practice was to\nmatch labels with contents immediately upon opening an\nevidence box. Id., at 287.\n   The State challenged Dr. Blake\u2019s scientific conclusions,\nand to do so it called Agent Bigbee as a witness. Agent\nBigbee defended the testimony he had given at the trial.\nTo begin with, he suggested Dr. Blake had misconstrued\nthe term \u201cinc\u201d in Agent Bigbee\u2019s trial report, interpreting\nit to mean \u201cincomplete\u201d when it in fact meant \u201cinconclu\nsive.\u201d Id., at 254\u2013256, 282. Dr. Blake, however, replied\n\u201c[s]ame difference\u201d when asked whether his opinion would\nchange if \u201cinc\u201d meant \u201cinconclusive.\u201d Id., at 256; see also\n6 Tr. 906 (Bigbee trial testimony) (\u201cYou will notice I have\nINC written under the transparent, that is the symbol\nthat I use to mean the test was incomplete\u201d). Agent Big-\nbee further asserted that, whereas Dr. Blake (in Bigbee\u2019s\nview) construed the results to mean the enzyme was not\npresent at all, in fact the results indicated only that Big-\nbee could not identify the marker type on whatever en\nzymes were present. App. 282. Yet the State did not\ncross-examine Dr. Blake on this point, nor did the District\nCourt resolve the dispute one way or the other, so on this\nrecord it seems possible that Dr. Blake meant only to\nsuggest the blood was too degraded to permit conclusive\ntyping. The State, moreover, does not ask us to question\nDr. Blake\u2019s basic premise about the durability of blood\nchemicals deposited on cotton\u2014a premise Agent Bigbee\nappeared to accept as a general matter. Given the record\nas it stands, then, we cannot say Dr. Blake\u2019s conclusions\nhave been discredited; if other objections might be ad\nduced, they must await further proceedings. At the least,\nthe record before us contains credible testimony suggest\ning that the missing enzyme markers are generally better\npreserved on cloth than in poorly kept test tubes, and that\nprinciple could support House\u2019s spillage theory for the\n                  Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)            27\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nblood\u2019s origin.\n  In this Court, as a further attack on House\u2019s showing,\nthe State suggests that, given the spatter expert\u2019s testi\nmony, House\u2019s theory would require a jury to surmise that\nTennessee officials donned the pants and deliberately\nspread blood over them. We disagree. This should be a\nmatter for the trier of fact to consider in the first instance,\nbut we can note a line of argument that could refute the\nState\u2019s position. It is correct that the State\u2019s spatter ex\npert opined that the stains resulted from wiping or smear\ning rather than direct spillage; and she further stated that\nthe distribution of stains in some spots suggests the pants\nwere \u201cfolded in some manner or creased in some manner\u201d\nwhen the transfers occurred, id., at 296. While the expert\ndescribed this pattern, at least with respect to stains on\nthe lap of the pants, as \u201cconsistent\u201d with the pants being\nworn at the time of the staining, ibid., her testimony, as\nwe understand it, does not refute the hypothesis that the\npackaging of the pants for transport was what caused\nthem to be folded or creased. It seems permissible, more\nover, to conclude that the small size and wide distribution\nof stains\u2014inside the right pocket, outside that pocket,\nnear the inside button, on the left thigh and outside leg, on\nthe seat of the pants, and on the right bottom cuff, includ\ning inside the pants\u2014fits as well with spillage in transport\nas with wiping and smearing from bloody objects at the\ncrime scene, as the State proposes. (As has been noted, no\nblood was found on House\u2019s shoes.)\n  The District Court discounted Dr. Blake\u2019s opinion, not\non account of Blake\u2019s substantive approach, but based on\ntestimony from Agent Scott indicating he saw, as the\nDistrict Court put it, \u201cwhat appeared to be bloodstains on\nMr. House\u2019s blue jeans when the jeans were removed from\nthe laundry hamper at Ms. Turner\u2019s trailer.\u201d Id., at 348.\nThis inference seems at least open to question, however.\nAgent Scott stated only that he \u201csaw reddish brownish\n28                     HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstains [he] suspected to be blood\u201d; he admitted that he\n\u201cdidn\u2019t thoroughly examine the blue jeans at that time.\u201d\nR276:113\u2013114. The pants were in fact extensively soiled\nwith mud and reddish stains, only small portions of which\nare blood.\n   In sum, considering \u201c \u2018all the evidence,\u2019 \u201d Schlup, 513\nU. S., at 328 (quoting Friendly, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev., at 160),\non this issue, we think the evidentiary disarray surround\ning the blood, taken together with Dr. Blake\u2019s testimony\nand the limited rebuttal of it in the present record, would\nprevent reasonable jurors from placing significant reliance\non the blood evidence. We now know, though the trial jury\ndid not, that an Assistant Chief Medical Examiner be\nlieves the blood on House\u2019s jeans must have come from\nautopsy samples; that a vial and a quarter of autopsy\nblood is unaccounted for; that the blood was transported to\nthe FBI together with the pants in conditions that could\nhave caused vials to spill; that the blood did indeed spill at\nleast once during its journey from Tennessee authorities\nthrough FBI hands to a defense expert; that the pants\nwere stored in a plastic bag bearing both a large blood\nstain and a label with TBI Agent Scott\u2019s name; and that\nthe styrofoam box containing the blood samples may well\nhave been opened before it arrived at the FBI lab. Thus,\nwhereas the bloodstains, emphasized by the prosecution,\nseemed strong evidence of House\u2019s guilt at trial, the record\nnow raises substantial questions about the blood\u2019s origin.\n                    A Different Suspect\n  Were House\u2019s challenge to the State\u2019s case limited to the\nquestions he has raised about the blood and semen, the\nother evidence favoring the prosecution might well suffice\nto bar relief. There is, however, more; for in the post-trial\nproceedings House presented troubling evidence that Mr.\nMuncey, the victim\u2019s husband, himself could have been the\nmurderer.\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)          29\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   At trial, as has been noted, the jury heard that roughly\ntwo weeks before the murder Mrs. Muncey\u2019s brother re\nceived a frightened phone call from his sister indicating\nthat she and Mr. Muncey had been fighting, that she was\nscared, and that she wanted to leave him. The jury also\nlearned that the brother once saw Mr. Muncey \u201csmac[k]\u201d\nthe victim. 7 Tr. 1087\u20131088. House now has produced\nevidence from multiple sources suggesting that Mr. Muncey\nregularly abused his wife. For example, one witness\u2014\nKathy Parker, a lifelong area resident who denied any\nanimosity towards Mr. Muncey\u2014recalled that Mrs. Muncey\n\u201cwas constantly with black eyes and busted mouth.\u201d App.\n235. In addition Hazel Miller, who is Kathy Parker\u2019s\nmother and a lifelong acquaintance of Mr. Muncey, testi\nfied at the habeas hearing that two or three months before\nthe victim\u2019s death Mr. Muncey came to Miller\u2019s home and\n\u201ctried to get my daughter [Parker] to go out with him,\u201d\nR274:47. (Parker had dated Mr. Muncey at age 14.) Ac\ncording to Miller, Muncey said \u201c[h]e was upset with his\nwife, that they had had an argument and he said he was\ngoing to get rid of that woman one way or the other.\u201d App.\n236.\n   Another witness\u2014Mary Atkins, also an area native who\n\u201cgrew up\u201d with Mr. Muncey and professed no hard feel\nings, R274:10, 16\u2014claims she saw Mr. Muncey \u201cback\nhan[d]\u201d Mrs. Muncey on the very night of the murder.\nApp. 226, 228. Atkins recalled that during a break in the\nrecreation center dance, she saw Mr. Muncey and his wife\narguing in the parking lot. Mr. Muncey \u201cgrabbed her and\nhe just backhanded her.\u201d Id., at 228. After that, Mrs.\nMuncey \u201cleft walking.\u201d Id., at 229. There was also testi\nmony from Atkins\u2019 mother, named Artie Lawson. A self-\ndescribed \u201cgood friend\u201d of Mr. Muncey, id., at 231, Lawson\nsaid Mr. Muncey visited her the morning after the mur\nder, before the body was found. According to Lawson, Mr.\nMuncey asked her to tell anyone who inquired not only\n30                      HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nthat she had been at the dance the evening before and had\nseen him, but also that he had breakfasted at her home at\n6 o\u2019clock that morning. Lawson had not in fact been at the\ndance, nor had Mr. Muncey been with her so early.\n   Of most importance is the testimony of Kathy Parker\nand her sister Penny Letner. They testified at the habeas\nhearing that, around the time of House\u2019s trial, Mr. Muncey\nhad confessed to the crime. Parker recalled that she and\n\u201csome family members and some friends [were] sitting\naround drinking\u201d at Parker\u2019s trailer when Mr. Muncey\n\u201cjust walked in and sit down.\u201d R274:37. Muncey, who had\nevidently been drinking heavily, began \u201crambling off . . .\n[t]alking about what happened to his wife and how it\nhappened and he didn\u2019t mean to do it.\u201d Ibid. According to\nParker, Mr. Muncey \u201csaid they had been into [an] argu\nment and he slapped her and she fell and hit her head and\nit killed her and he didn\u2019t mean for it to happen.\u201d Id., at\n38. Parker said she \u201cfreaked out and run him off.\u201d Ibid.\n   Letner similarly recalled that at some point either \u201cdur\ning [House\u2019s] trial or just before,\u201d id., at 30, Mr. Muncey\nintruded on a gathering at Parker\u2019s home. Appearing\n\u201cpretty well blistered,\u201d Muncey \u201cwent to crying and was\ntalking about his wife and her death and he was saying\nthat he didn\u2019t mean to do it.\u201d App. 232. \u201c[D]idn\u2019t mean to\ndo what[?],\u201d Letner asked, R274:33, at which point Mr.\nMuncey explained:\n       \u201c[S]he was \u2018bitching him out\u2019 because he didn\u2019t take\n       her fishing that night, that he went to the dance in\n       stead. He said when he come home that she was still\n       on him pretty heavily \u2018bitching him out\u2019 again and\n       that he smacked her and that she fell and hit her\n       head. He said I didn\u2019t mean to do it, but I had to get\n       rid of her, because I didn\u2019t want to be charged with\n       murder.\u201d App. 232\u2013233.\n     Letner, who was then 19 years old with a small child,\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)           31\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsaid Mr. Muncey\u2019s statement \u201cscared [her] quite badly,\u201d so\nshe \u201cgot out of there immediately.\u201d Id., at 233. Asked\nwhether she reported the incident to the authorities,\nLetner stated, \u201cI was frightened, you know. . . . I figured\nme being 19 year old they wouldn\u2019t listen to anything I\nhad to say.\u201d R274:31. Parker, on the other hand, claimed\nshe (Parker) in fact went to the Sherriff\u2019s Department, but\nno one would listen:\n    \u201cI tried to speak to the Sheriff but he was real busy.\n    He sent me to a deputy. The deputy told me to go up\n    stairs to the courtroom and talk to this guy, I can\u2019t\n    remember his name. I never did really get to talk to\n    anybody.\u201d App. 234.\nParker said she did not discuss the matter further because\n\u201c[t]hey had it all signed, sealed and delivered. We didn\u2019t\nknow anything to do until we heard that they reopened\n[House\u2019s] trial.\u201d R274:45. Parker\u2019s mother, Hazel Miller,\nconfirmed she had driven Parker to the courthouse, where\nParker \u201cwent to talk to some of the people about this case.\u201d\nApp. 237.\n   Other testimony suggests Mr. Muncey had the opportu\nnity to commit the crime. According to Dennis Wallace, a\nlocal law enforcement official who provided security at the\ndance on the night of the murder, Mr. Muncey left the\ndance \u201caround 10:00, 10:30, 9:30 to 10:30.\u201d R274:56\u201357.\nAlthough Mr. Muncey told law enforcement officials just\nafter the murder that he left the dance only briefly and\nreturned, Wallace could not recall seeing him back there\nagain. Later that evening, Wallace responded to Mr.\nMuncey\u2019s report that his wife was missing. Muncey de\nnied he and his wife had been \u201ca fussing or a fighting\u201d; he\nclaimed his wife had been \u201ckidnapped.\u201d Id., at 58. Wal\nlace did not recall seeing any blood, disarray, or knocked-\nover furniture, although he admitted he \u201cdidn\u2019t pay too\nmuch attention\u201d to whether the floor appeared especially\n32                    HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nclean. According to Wallace, Mr. Muncey said \u201clet\u2019s search\nfor her\u201d and then led Wallace out to search \u201cin the weeds\u201d\naround the home and the driveway (not out on the road\nwhere the body was found). Id., at 58, 60, 63.\n   In the habeas proceedings, then, two different witnesses\n(Parker and Letner) described a confession by Mr.\nMuncey; two more (Atkins and Lawson) described suspi\ncious behavior (a fight and an attempt to construct a false\nalibi) around the time of the crime; and still other wit\nnesses described a history of abuse.\n   As to Parker and Letner, the District Court noted that it\nwas \u201cnot impressed with the allegations of individuals who\nwait over ten years to come forward with their evidence,\u201d\nespecially considering that \u201cthere was no physical evi\ndence in the Munceys\u2019 kitchen to corroborate [Mr.\nMuncey\u2019s] alleged confession that he killed [his wife]\nthere.\u201d App. 348. Parker and Letner, however, did at\ntempt to explain their delay coming forward, and the\nrecord indicates no reason why these two women, both\nlifelong acquaintances of Mr. Muncey, would have wanted\neither to frame him or to help House. Furthermore, the\nrecord includes at least some independent support for the\nstatements Parker and Letner attributed to Mr. Muncey.\nThe supposed explanation for the fatal fight\u2014that his wife\nwas complaining about going fishing\u2014fits with Mrs.\nMuncey\u2019s statement to Luttrell earlier that evening that\nher husband\u2019s absence was \u201call right, because she was\ngoing to make him take her fishing the next day,\u201d id., at\n11\u201312. And Dr. Blake testified, in only partial contradic\ntion of Dr. Carabia, that Mrs. Muncey\u2019s head injury re\nsulted from \u201ca surface with an edge\u201d or \u201ca hard surface\nwith a corner,\u201d not from a fist. R275:72. (Dr. Carabia had\nsaid either a fist or some other object could have been the\ncause.)\n   Mr. Muncey testified at the habeas hearing, and the\nDistrict Court did not question his credibility. Though Mr.\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)          33\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMuncey said he seemed to remember visiting Lawson the\nday after the murder, he denied either killing his wife or\nconfessing to doing so. Yet Mr. Muncey also claimed,\ncontrary to Constable Wallace\u2019s testimony and to his own\nprior statement, that he left the dance on the night of the\ncrime only when it ended at midnight. Mr. Muncey, more\nover, denied ever hitting Mrs. Muncey; the State itself had\nto impeach him with a prior statement on this point.\n   It bears emphasis, finally, that Parker\u2019s and Letner\u2019s\ntestimony is not comparable to the sort of eleventh-hour\naffidavit vouching for a defendant and incriminating a\nconveniently absent suspect that Justice O\u2019Connor de\nscribed in her concurring opinion in Herrera as \u201cunfortu\nnate\u201d and \u201cnot uncommon\u201d in capital cases, 506 U. S., at\n423; nor was the confession Parker and Letner described\ninduced under pressure of interrogation. The confession\nevidence here involves an alleged spontaneous statement\nrecounted by two eyewitnesses with no evident motive to\nlie. For this reason it has more probative value than, for\nexample, incriminating testimony from inmates, suspects,\nor friends or relations of the accused.\n   The evidence pointing to Mr. Muncey is by no means\nconclusive. If considered in isolation, a reasonable jury\nmight well disregard it. In combination, however, with the\nchallenges to the blood evidence and the lack of motive with\nrespect to House, the evidence pointing to Mr. Muncey\nlikely would reinforce other doubts as to House\u2019s guilt.\n                     Other Evidence\n  Certain other details were presented at the habeas\nhearing. First, Dr. Blake, in addition to testifying about\nthe blood evidence and the victim\u2019s head injury, examined\nphotographs of House\u2019s bruises and scratches and con\ncluded, based on 35 years\u2019 experience monitoring the\ndevelopment and healing of bruises, that they were too old\nto have resulted from the crime. In addition Dr. Blake\n34                    HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nclaimed that the injury on House\u2019s right knuckle was\nindicative of \u201c[g]etting mashed\u201d; it was not consistent with\nstriking someone. R275:63. (That of course would also\neliminate the explanation that the injury came from the\nblow House supposedly told Turner he gave to his uniden\ntified assailant.)\n   The victim\u2019s daughter, Lora Muncey (now Lora Tharp),\nalso testified at the habeas hearing. She repeated her\nrecollection of hearing a man with a deep voice like her\ngrandfather\u2019s and a statement that her father had had a\nwreck down by the creek. She also denied seeing any\nsigns of struggle or hearing a fight between her parents,\nthough she also said she could not recall her parents ever\nfighting physically. The District Court found her credible,\nand this testimony certainly cuts in favor of the State.\n   Finally, House himself testified at the habeas proceed\nings. He essentially repeated the story he allegedly told\nTurner about getting attacked on the road. The District\nCourt found, however, based on House\u2019s demeanor, that he\n\u201cwas not a credible witness.\u201d App. 329.\n                         Conclusion\n   This is not a case of conclusive exoneration. Some as\npects of the State\u2019s evidence\u2014Lora Muncey\u2019s memory of a\ndeep voice, House\u2019s bizarre evening walk, his lie to law\nenforcement, his appearance near the body, and the blood\non his pants\u2014still support an inference of guilt. Yet the\ncentral forensic proof connecting House to the crime\u2014the\nblood and the semen\u2014has been called into question, and\nHouse has put forward substantial evidence pointing to a\ndifferent suspect. Accordingly, and although the issue is\nclose, we conclude that this is the rare case where\u2014had\nthe jury heard all the conflicting testimony\u2014it is more\nlikely than not that no reasonable juror viewing the record\nas a whole would lack reasonable doubt.\n                  Cite as: 547 U.

In Herrera, decided three years before\nSchlup, the Court assumed without deciding that \u201cin a\ncapital case a truly persuasive demonstration of \u2018actual\ninnocence\u2019 made after trial would render the execution of a\ndefendant unconstitutional, and warrant federal habeas\nrelief if there were no state avenue open to process such a\nclaim.\u201d 506 U. S., at 417; see also id., at 419 (O\u2019Connor, J.,\nconcurring) (\u201cI cannot disagree with the fundamental legal\nprinciple that executing the innocent is inconsistent with\nthe Constitution\u201d). \u201c[T]he threshold showing for such an\nassumed right would necessarily be extraordinarily high,\u201d\nthe Court explained, and petitioner\u2019s evidence there fell\n\u201cfar short of that which would have to be made in order to\ntrigger the sort of constitutional claim which we have\nassumed, arguendo, to exist.\u201d Id., at 417, 418\u2013419; see\nalso id., at 427 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (noting that\nbecause \u201c[p]etitioner has failed to make a persuasive\nshowing of actual innocence,\u201d \u201cthe Court has no reason to\npass on, and appropriately reserves, the question whether\nfederal courts may entertain convincing claims of actual\ninnocence\u201d). House urges the Court to answer the ques\ntion left open in Herrera and hold not only that freestand\ning innocence claims are possible but also that he has\nestablished one.\n   We decline to resolve this issue. We conclude here,\nmuch as in Herrera, that whatever burden a hypothetical\nfreestanding innocence claim would require, this peti\ntioner has not satisfied it. To be sure, House has cast\nconsiderable doubt on his guilt\u2014doubt sufficient to satisfy\nSchlup\u2019s gateway standard for obtaining federal review\ndespite a state procedural default. In Herrera, however,\nthe Court described the threshold for any hypothetical\n36                    HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfreestanding innocence claim as \u201cextraordinarily high.\u201d\n506 U. S., at 417. The sequence of the Court\u2019s decisions in\nHerrera and Schlup\u2014first leaving unresolved the status of\nfreestanding claims and then establishing the gateway\nstandard\u2014implies at the least that Herrera requires more\nconvincing proof of innocence than Schlup. It follows,\ngiven the closeness of the Schlup question here, that\nHouse\u2019s showing falls short of the threshold implied in\nHerrera.\n                       *     *    *\n  House has satisfied the gateway standard set forth in\nSchlup and may proceed on remand with procedurally\ndefaulted constitutional claims.

Delo,\n513 U. S. 298, 326, 327 (1995) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). To make the requisite showing of actual inno\ncence, House must produce \u201cnew reliable evidence\u201d and\n\u201cmust show that it is more likely than not that no reason\nable juror would have convicted him in the light of the new\nevidence.\u201d Id., at 324, 327 (emphasis added). The question\nis not whether House was prejudiced at his trial because the\njurors were not aware of the new evidence, but whether all\nthe evidence, considered together, proves that House was\nactually innocent, so that no reasonable juror would vote to\nconvict him. Considering all the evidence, and giving due\nregard to the District Court\u2019s findings on whether House\u2019s\nnew evidence was reliable, I do not find it probable that no\nreasonable juror would vote to convict him, and accordingly\nI dissent.\n2                      HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n  Because I do not think that House has satisfied the actual\ninnocence standard set forth in Schlup, I do not believe that\nhe has met the higher threshold for a freestanding inno\ncence claim, assuming such a claim exists. See Herrera v.\nCollins, 506 U. S. 390, 417 (1993). I therefore concur in the\njudgment with respect to the Court\u2019s disposition of that\nseparate claim.\n                                I\n   In Schlup, we stated that a habeas petitioner attempt\ning to present a defaulted claim to a federal court must\npresent \u201cnew reliable evidence\u2014whether it be exculpatory\nscientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or\ncritical physical evidence\u2014that was not presented at\ntrial.\u201d 513 U. S., at 324 (emphasis added). Implicit in the\nrequirement that a habeas petitioner present reliable\nevidence is the expectation that a factfinder will assess\nreliability. The new evidence at issue in Schlup had not\nbeen subjected to such an assessment\u2014the claim in\nSchlup was for an evidentiary hearing\u2014and this Court\nspecifically recognized that the \u201cnew statements may, of\ncourse, be unreliable.\u201d Id., at 331. The Court stated that\nthe District Court, as the \u201creviewing tribunal,\u201d was tasked\nwith assessing the \u201cprobative force\u201d of the petitioner\u2019s new\nevidence of innocence, and \u201cmay have to make some credi\nbility assessments.\u201d Id., at 327\u2013328, 330. Indeed, the\nSupreme Court took the unusual step of remanding the\ncase to the Court of Appeals \u201cwith instructions to remand\nto the District Court,\u201d so that the District Court could\nconsider how the \u201clikely credibility of the affiants\u201d bears\nupon the \u201cprobable reliability\u201d of the new evidence. Id., at\n332. In short, the new evidence is not simply taken at face\nvalue; its reliability has to be tested.\n   Critical to the Court\u2019s conclusion here that House has\nsufficiently demonstrated his innocence are three pieces of\nnew evidence presented to the District Court: DNA evi\n                  Cite as: 547 U.

J.\n\ndence showing that the semen on Carolyn Muncey\u2019s cloth\ning was from her husband, Hubert Muncey, not from\nHouse; testimony from new witnesses implicating Mr.\nMuncey in the murder; and evidence indicating that Mrs.\nMuncey\u2019s blood spilled from test tubes containing autopsy\nsamples in an evidence container. To determine whether\nit should open its door to House\u2019s defaulted constitutional\nclaims, the District Court considered this evidence in a\ncomprehensive evidentiary hearing. As House presented\nhis new evidence, and as the State rebutted it, the District\nCourt observed the witnesses\u2019 demeanor, examined physi\ncal evidence, and made findings about whether House\u2019s\nnew evidence was in fact reliable. This factfinding role is\nfamiliar to a district court. \u201cThe trial judge\u2019s major role is\nthe determination of fact, and with experience in fulfilling\nthat role comes expertise.\u201d Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470\nU. S. 564, 574 (1985).\n   The State did not contest House\u2019s new DNA evidence\nexcluding him as the source of the semen on Mrs.\nMuncey\u2019s clothing, but it strongly contested the new tes\ntimony implicating Mr. Muncey, and it insisted that the\nblood spillage occurred after the FBI tested House\u2019s jeans\nand determined that they were stained with Mrs.\nMuncey\u2019s blood.\n   At the evidentiary hearing, sisters Kathy Parker and\nPenny Letner testified that 14 years earlier, either during\nor around the time of House\u2019s trial, they heard Mr.\nMuncey drunkenly confess to having accidentally killed\nhis wife when he struck her in their home during an ar\ngument, causing her to fall and hit her head. Record, Doc.\n274, pp. 28\u201329, 30, 37\u201338. Schlup provided guidance on\nhow a district court should assess this type of new evi\ndence: The court \u201cmay consider how the timing of the\nsubmission and the likely credibility of the affiants bear\non the probable reliability of that evidence,\u201d and it \u201cmust\nassess the probative force of the newly presented evidence\n4                      HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nin connection with the evidence of guilt adduced at trial.\u201d\n513 U. S., at 332. Consistent with this guidance, the\nDistrict Court concluded that the sisters\u2019 testimony was\nnot credible. The court noted that it was \u201cnot impressed\nwith the allegations of individuals who wait over ten years\nto come forward.\u201d App. 348. It also considered how the\nnew testimony fit within the larger web of evidence, ob\nserving that Mr. Muncey\u2019s alleged confession contradicted\nthe testimony of the Munceys\u2019 \u201cvery credible\u201d daughter,\nLora Tharp, who consistently testified that she did not\nhear a fight in the house that night, but instead heard a\nman with a deep voice who lured her mother from the\nhouse by saying that Mr. Muncey had been in a wreck\nnear the creek. Id., at 323, 348.\n   The District Court engaged in a similar reliability in\nquiry with regard to House\u2019s new evidence of blood spill\nage. At the evidentiary hearing, House conceded that FBI\ntesting showed that his jeans were stained with Mrs.\nMuncey\u2019s blood, but he set out to prove that the blood\nspilled from test tubes containing autopsy samples, and\nthat it did so before the jeans were tested by the FBI. The\nDistrict Court summarized the testimony of the various\nwitnesses who handled the evidence and their recollec\ntions about bloodstains and spillage; it acknowledged that\nHouse\u2019s expert, Dr. Cleland Blake, disagreed with FBI\nAgent Paul Bigbee about how to interpret the results of\nAgent Bigbee\u2019s genetic marker analysis summary; and it\nsummarized the testimony of the State\u2019s blood spatter\nexpert, Paulette Sutton. Id., at 339\u2013347. After reviewing\nall the evidence, the District Court stated: \u201cBased upon\nthe evidence introduced during the evidentiary hearing . . .\nthe court concludes that the spillage occurred after the\nFBI crime laboratory received and tested the evidence.\u201d\nId., at 348 (emphasis added).\n   Normally, an appellate court reviews a district court\u2019s\nfactual findings only for clear error.

Yet the majority asserts that the clear error stan\ndard \u201coverstates the effect of the District Court\u2019s ruling,\u201d\nand then dismisses the District Court\u2019s reliability findings\nbecause it is \u201cuncertain about\u201d them, while stopping short\nof identifying clear error. Ante, at 20. This is a sharp\ndeparture from the guidance in Schlup.\n   In Schlup, we contrasted a district court\u2019s role in assess\ning the reliability of new evidence of innocence with a\ndistrict court\u2019s role in deciding a summary judgment\nmotion. 513 U. S., at 332. We explained that, in the latter\nsituation, the district court does not assess credibility or\nweigh the evidence, but simply determines whether there\nis a genuine factual issue for trial. Ibid. Assessing the\nreliability of new evidence, on the other hand, is a typical\nfactfinding role, requiring credibility determinations and a\nweighing of the \u201cprobative force\u201d of the new evidence in\nlight of \u201cthe evidence of guilt adduced at trial.\u201d Ibid. We\nfound it \u201cobviou[s]\u201d that a habeas court conducting an\nactual innocence inquiry must do more than simply check\nwhether there are genuine factual issues for trial. Ibid.\nThe point of the actual innocence inquiry is for the federal\nhabeas court to satisfy itself that it should suspend the\nnormal procedural default rule, disregard the important\njudicial interests of finality and comity, and allow a state\n6                      HOUSE v.

S. 467, 490\u2013\n491 (1991).\n   The majority surprisingly states that this guidance is\ninapplicable here because this case involves a \u201cfully devel\noped record,\u201d while the district court in Schlup had de\nclined to conduct an evidentiary hearing. Ante, at 17\u201318.\nBut the guidance is clearly applicable: The point in Schlup\nwas not simply that a hearing was required, but why\u2014\nbecause the district court had to assess the probative force\nof the petitioner\u2019s newly presented evidence, by engaging\nin factfinding rather than performing a summary judg\nment-type inquiry. 513 U. S., at 331\u2013332. That is pre\ncisely what the District Court did here. In addition to a\n\u201cfully developed record,\u201d we have the District Court\u2019s\nfactual findings about the reliability of the new evidence\nin that record, factual findings which the majority disre\ngards without finding clear error.\n   The majority essentially disregards the District Court\u2019s\nrole in assessing the reliability of House\u2019s new evidence.\nWith regard to the sisters\u2019 testimony, the majority casts\naside the District Court\u2019s determination that their state\nments came too late and were too inconsistent with credi\nble record evidence to be reliable, instead observing that\nthe women had no obvious reason to lie, that a few aspects\nof their testimony have record support, and that they\nrecounted an uncoerced confession. Ante, at 32\u201333. As for\nthe District Court\u2019s express finding that the autopsy blood\nspilled after the FBI tested House\u2019s jeans, the majority\npoints to Dr. Blake\u2019s testimony that blood enzymes \u201care\ngenerally better preserved on cloth,\u201d and even conjures up\nits own theory in an attempt to refute Ms. Sutton\u2019s expert\ntestimony that the pattern of some bloodstains was consis\ntent with blood being transferred while the pants were\nbeing worn. Ante, at 27 (\u201cThis should be a matter for the\ntrier of fact to consider in the first instance, but we can\n                 Cite as: 547 U.

S., at 332. By casting aside the\nDistrict Court\u2019s factual determinations made after a com\nprehensive evidentiary hearing, the majority has done\nlittle more than reiterate the factual disputes presented\nbelow. Witnesses do not testify in our courtroom, and it is\nnot our role to make credibility findings and construct\ntheories of the possible ways in which Mrs. Muncey\u2019s blood\ncould have been spattered and wiped on House\u2019s jeans.\nThe District Court did not painstakingly conduct an evi\ndentiary hearing to compile a record for us to sort through\ntranscript by transcript and photograph by photograph,\nassessing for ourselves the reliability of what we see.\nSchlup made abundantly clear that reliability determina\ntions were essential, but were for the district court to\nmake. 513 U. S., at 331\u2013332. We are to defer to the better\nsituated District Court on reliability, unless we determine\nthat its findings are clearly erroneous. We are not con\ncerned with \u201cthe district court\u2019s independent judgment as\nto whether reasonable doubt exists,\u201d id., at 329, but the\nDistrict Court here made basic factual findings about the\nreliability of House\u2019s new evidence; it did not offer its\npersonal opinion about whether it doubted House\u2019s guilt.\nSchlup makes clear that those findings are controlling\nunless clearly erroneous.\n   I have found no clear error in the District Court\u2019s reli\nability findings. Not having observed Ms. Parker and Ms.\nLetner testify, I would defer to the District Court\u2019s deter\nmination that they are not credible, and the evidence in\nthe record undermining the tale of an accidental killing\n8                       HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nduring a fight in the Muncey home convinces me that this\ncredibility finding is not clearly erroneous. Dr. Alex Cara\nbia, who performed the autopsy, testified to injuries far\nmore severe than a bump on the head: Mrs. Muncey had\nbruises on the front and back of her neck, on both thighs,\non her lower right leg and left knee, and her hands were\nbloodstained up to the wrists; her injuries were consistent\nwith a struggle and traumatic strangulation. Record,\nAddendum 4, 7 Tr. of Evidence in No. 378 (Crim. Ct. Un\nion County, Tenn.) 984\u2013987 (hereinafter Tr.) And, of\ncourse, Lora Tharp has consistently recalled a deep-voiced\nvisitor arriving late at night to tell Mrs. Muncey that her\nhusband was in a wreck near the creek. App. 19, 270.\n   I also find abundant evidence in the record to support\nthe District Court\u2019s finding that blood spilled within the\nevidence container after the FBI received and tested\nHouse\u2019s jeans. Agent Bigbee testified that there was no\nleakage in the items submitted to him for testing. Id., at\n277. The majority\u2019s entire analysis on this point assumes\nthe agent flatly lied, though there was no attack on his\ncredibility below. Moreover, Ms. Sutton determined, in\nher expert opinion, that the wide distribution of stains\n\u201cfront and back, top to bottom,\u201d the fact that some blood\nstains were mixed with mud, and the presence of blood\nstains inside the pocket and inside the fly, showed that the\nblood was spattered and wiped\u2014not spilled\u2014on House\u2019s\njeans. Id., at 291\u2013293, 295; id., at 293 (\u201c[I]f a tube of blood\nhad spilled on these pants, the stain should have been in a\nlocalized area\u201d); id., at 294 (\u201cThe stains also . . . either\noriginate on the inside and don\u2019t soak out or on the outside\nand are not soaking to the inside. That, of course, would\nbe what you would see with a spill\u201d).\n   It is also worth noting that the blood evidently spilled\ninside the evidence container when the jeans were pro\ntected inside a plastic zip lock bag, as shown by the pres\nence of a bloodstain on the outside of that bag. See Re\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)            9\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\ncord, Plt. Exh. 10\u20136. House\u2019s expert tested the exterior\nand interior of that plastic bag for bloodstains using an\n\u201cextremely sensitive\u201d test, and only the exterior of the bag\ntested positive for blood. Id., Doc. 274, at 95\u201396. The\nevidence in the record indicates that the jeans were placed\nin the plastic bag after they arrived at the FBI: FBI re\ncords show that the jeans arrived there in a paper bag,\nand the plastic bag has FBI markings on it. Id., Adden\ndum 2, Trial Exh. 31, p. 36; id., Plt. Exh. 10\u20136. The blood\nstain on the outside of the plastic bag therefore further\nsupports the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the blood\nspilled after the evidence was received and tested by the\nFBI, and not en route when the jeans were in a paper bag.\nI suppose it is theoretically possible that the jeans were\ncontaminated by spillage before arriving at the FBI, that\nAgent Bigbee either failed to note or lied about such spill\nage, and that the FBI then transferred the jeans into a\nplastic bag and put them back inside the evidence con\ntainer with the spilled blood still sloshing around suffi\nciently to contaminate the outside of the plastic bag as\nextensively as it did. This sort of unbridled speculation\ncan theoretically defeat any inconvenient fact, but does\nnot suffice to convince me that the District Court\u2019s factual\nfinding\u2014that the blood spilled after FBI testing\u2014was\nclearly erroneous.\n   Moreover, the yellow \u201cTennessee Crime Lab\u201d tape\nplaced around the container on all four sides does not line\nup when the bloodstained corners of the container and its\nlid are aligned, showing that the blood did not spill until\nsometime after the container was received and opened at\nits first destination\u2014the FBI. See id., Respondent\u2019s Exh.\n24; id., Doc. 276, pp. 190\u2013191 (testimony of Paulette Sut\nton). The majority points out that on one side of the con\ntainer, the first of two layers of tape appears to begin\ncleanly at the lid\u2019s edge, and from this concludes that the\ncontainer must have been cut open and resealed by Ten\n10                     HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nnessee authorities en route to the FBI. Ante, at 25; see\nRecord, Respondent\u2019s Exh. 23d. Even if the majority\u2019s\ndeduction from a photograph of the container were true, it\nwould show only that Tennessee authorities had reason to\nopen the container once it was sealed to take something\nout or put something in, perhaps back at the crime lab in\nUnion County. But even if the container had been opened\nbefore its arrival at the FBI, the majority recognizes that\nit was resealed with \u201cTennessee Crime Lab\u201d tape, and the\nsecond layer of tape aligns only when the bloodstains on\nthe container and its lid do not. Ante, at 24\u201325. Of course,\nthe District Court\u2014which concluded that the blood was\nspilled after testing at the FBI laboratory\u2014had before it\nthe box itself with the tape as the witnesses testified on\nthe point, and not\u2014like this Court\u2014simply a photograph.\nSee Bessemer City, 470 U. S., at 574 (district court\u2019s find\nings about physical evidence are reviewed for clear error).\n   House\u2019s theory that the blood on his jeans was trans\nferred there from the autopsy samples is based on Dr.\nBlake\u2019s reading of Agent Bigbee\u2019s enzyme marker analysis\nsummary. After reading the summary, Dr. Blake con\ncluded that the enzymes in the bloodstains on House\u2019s\njeans and the enzymes in the autopsy samples had dete\nriorated to the same extent. Record, Doc. 275, p. 110. In\nparticular, he noted that the GLO1 enzyme showed \u201cin\ncomplete penetration\u201d on both the autopsy blood and the\njeans, and because enzymes are better preserved on cloth,\nthe enzyme should have been present on the jeans. Id., at\n116. But Agent Bigbee disputed Dr. Blake\u2019s reading of\nwhat was, after all, Agent Bigbee\u2019s own study. He testi\nfied that \u201c \u2018inc\u2019 \u201d on his chart meant \u201cinconclusive,\u201d not\n\u201cincomplete penetration,\u201d and that the term \u201cinconclusive\u201d\nmeant that the enzyme was present, but could not be\ngrouped into an ABO bloodtype. Id., Doc. 276, at 140.\nWhile pointing out that his summary showed different\nlevels of enzymes in the two samples, Agent Bigbee also\n                  Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)            11\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nnoted that many different factors\u2014such as heat, dirt, or\nbacteria in a clothes hamper\u2014could cause enzymes to\ndegrade on cloth. Id., at 139, 167\u2013170. Considering how\nHouse\u2019s new blood spillage evidence fits within the record\nas a whole, I can see no clear error in the District Court\u2019s\nexpress finding that the blood spilled in the evidence\ncontainer after the FBI found Mrs. Muncey\u2019s blood on\nHouse\u2019s jeans.\n   The District Court attentively presided over a complex\nevidentiary hearing, often questioning witnesses exten\nsively during the presentation of critical evidence. See,\ne.g., id., Doc. 275, at 110\u2013115. The court concisely sum\nmarized the evidence presented, then dutifully made\nfindings about the reliability of the testimony it heard and\nthe evidence it observed. We are poorly equipped to sec\nond-guess the District Court\u2019s reliability findings and\nshould defer to them, consistent with the guidance we\nprovided in Schlup.\n                              II\n  With due regard to the District Court\u2019s reliability find\nings, this case invites a straightforward application of the\nlegal standard adopted in Schlup. A petitioner does not\npass through the Schlup gateway if it is \u201cmore likely than\nnot that there is any juror who, acting reasonably, would\nhave found the petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\n513 U. S., at 333 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (emphasis\nadded).\n  The majority states that if House had presented just one\nof his three key pieces of evidence\u2014or even two of the\nthree\u2014he would not pass through the Schlup gateway.\nSee ante, at 28 (\u201cWere House\u2019s challenge to the State\u2019s\ncase limited to the questions he has raised about the blood\nand semen, the other evidence favoring the prosecution\nmight well suffice to bar relief\u201d); ante, at 33 (\u201cIf considered\nin isolation, a reasonable jury might well disregard [the\n12                     HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nevidence pointing to Mr. Muncey]. In combination, how\never, with the challenges to the blood evidence and the\nlack of motive with respect to House, the evidence pointing\nto Mr. Muncey likely would reinforce other doubts as to\nHouse\u2019s guilt\u201d). According to the majority, House has\npicked the trifecta of evidence that places conviction out\nside the realm of choices any juror, acting reasonably,\nwould make. Because the case against House remains\nsubstantially unaltered from the case presented to the\njury, I disagree.\n  At trial, the State presented its story about what hap\npened on the night of Mrs. Muncey\u2019s murder. The\nMunceys\u2019 daughter heard a deep-voiced perpetrator arrive\nat the Muncey home late at night and tell Mrs. Muncey\nthat her husband had been in a wreck near the creek.\nApp. 19. Ms. Tharp relayed her testimony again at the\nevidentiary hearing, and the District Court determined\nthat she was a \u201cvery credible witness.\u201d Id., at 270, 323.\n  When police questioned House after witnesses reported\nseeing him emerge from the embankment near Mrs.\nMuncey\u2019s body shortly before it was discovered, he told\ntwo different officers that he never left Donna Turner\u2019s\ntrailer the previous evening, even recounting the series of\ntelevision programs he watched before going to bed. 7 Tr.\n963\u2013965, 1031\u20131032. He had worked to concoct an alibi\nwe now know was a lie. On the day Mrs. Muncey\u2019s body\nwas found, Bill Breeding, a criminal investigator at the\nUnion County Sheriff\u2019s Office, observed House at the local\njail and noticed that he had abrasions \u201cacross his knuckles\nand about his hands,\u201d two or three bruises on his right\narm, scratches on his chest, and his right ring finger was\nred and swollen. 6 id., at 801\u2013802. The interviewing\nofficers noticed similar injuries. App. 78\u201380; 7 Tr. 974\u2013\n975. House told them that his finger was swollen because\nhe fell off a porch, and the scratches and bruises were\nfrom tearing down a building, and from a cat. Ibid. Ms.\n                  Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)           13\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nTurner initially confirmed House\u2019s alibi, but she changed\nher story when police warned her that covering up a homi\ncide was a serious offense. Id., at 1063. Ms. Turner then\ntold police that House had in fact left her house that night\nbetween 10:30 and 10:45 p.m. Id., at 1062\u20131063. He came\nback some time later panting and sweating, shirtless and\nshoeless, and with various injuries. App. 88\u201391; 8 Tr.\n1154\u20131155.\n   Also on the day the body was found, Sheriff Earl Loy\nasked House if he was wearing the same clothes he wore\nthe night before. 6 id., at 845. House \u201chesitated,\u201d then\nstated that he had changed his shirt, but not his jeans.\nIbid. In other words, he specifically tried to conceal from\nthe police that he had worn other jeans the night before,\nfor reasons that were to become clear. Ms. Turner re\nvealed that House\u2019s statement that he had not changed his\njeans was a lie, and police retrieved House\u2019s dirty jeans\nfrom Ms. Turner\u2019s hamper. Ibid. Of course, FBI testing\nrevealed that House\u2019s jeans were stained with Mrs.\nMuncey\u2019s blood, and the District Court determined that\nHouse\u2019s new evidence of blood spillage did not undermine\nthose test results. App. 348. If in fact Mrs. Muncey\u2019s\nblood only got on House\u2019s jeans from later evidentiary\nspillage, House would have had no reason to lie to try to\nkeep the existence of the concealed jeans from the police.\n   Through Ms. Turner\u2019s testimony at trial, the jury also\nheard House\u2019s story about what happened that night. He\nleft Ms. Turner\u2019s trailer late at night to go for a walk. Id.,\nat 86. When he returned some time later\u2014panting,\nsweating, and missing his shirt and shoes\u2014he told her\nthat some men in a truck tried to kill him. Id., at 88\u201391.\nWhen Ms. Turner asked House about his injuries, he\nattributed them to fighting with his assailants. Id., at 90;\n8 Tr. 1154\u20131155. House retold this story to the District\nCourt, saying that he initially lied to police because he\nwas on parole and did not want to draw attention to him\n14                     HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nself. Record, Doc. 276, at 99, 108\u2013109. In other words,\nhaving nothing to hide and facing a murder charge, House\nlied\u2014and when he was caught in the lie, he said he lied\nnot to escape the murder charge, but solely to avoid unex\nplained difficulties with his parole officer. The jury re\njected House\u2019s story about the night\u2019s events, and the\nDistrict Court \u201cconsidered Mr. House\u2019s demeanor and\nfound that he was not a credible witness.\u201d App. 329.\n   The jury also heard House\u2019s attempt to implicate Mr.\nMuncey in his wife\u2019s murder by calling Mrs. Muncey\u2019s\nbrother, Ricky Green, as a witness. Mr. Green testified\nthat two weeks before the murder, his sister called him to\nsay that she and Mr. Muncey had been fighting, that she\nwanted to leave him, and that she was scared. 7 Tr. 1088.\nMr. Green also testified that the Munceys had marital\nproblems, and that he had previously seen Mr. Muncey hit\nhis wife. Id., at 1087. The jury rejected House\u2019s attempt\nto implicate Mr. Muncey, and the District Court was not\npersuaded by House\u2019s attempt to supplement this evidence\nat the evidentiary hearing, finding that his new witnesses\nwere not credible. App. 348.\n   Noticeably absent from the State\u2019s story about what\nhappened to Mrs. Muncey on the night of her death was\nmuch mention of the semen found on Mrs. Muncey\u2019s cloth\ning. House\u2019s single victory at the evidentiary hearing was\nnew DNA evidence proving that the semen was deposited\nby Mr. Muncey. The majority identifies the semen evi\ndence as \u201c[c]entral to the State\u2019s case\u201d against House, ante,\nat 8, but House\u2019s jury would probably be quite surprised\nby this characterization. At trial, Agent Bigbee testified\nthat from the semen stains on Mrs. Muncey\u2019s clothing, he\ncould determine that the man who deposited the semen\nhad type A blood, and was a secretor. App. 54\u201356. Agent\nBigbee also testified that House and Mr. Muncey both\nhave type A blood, that House is a secretor, and that\n\u201c[t]here is an eighty (80%) percent chance that [Mr.\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)          15\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nMuncey] is a secretor.\u201d Id., at 55\u201356; 6 Tr. 952 (emphasis\nadded). Moreover, Agent Bigbee informed the jury that\nbecause 40 percent of people have type A blood, and 80\npercent of those people are secretors, the semen on Mrs.\nMuncey\u2019s clothing could have been deposited by roughly\none out of every three males. Id., at 957. The jury was\nalso informed several times by the defense that Mrs.\nMuncey\u2019s body was found fully clothed. See, e.g., 4 id., at\n628; 9 id., at 1274.\n  The majority describes House\u2019s sexual motive as \u201ca\ncentral theme in the State\u2019s narrative linking House to the\ncrime,\u201d and states that without the semen evidence, \u201ca\njury . . . would have found it necessary to establish some\ndifferent motive, or, if the same motive, an intent far more\nspeculative.\u201d Ante, at 21. The State, however, consis\ntently directed the jury\u2019s attention away from motive, and\nsexual motive was far from a \u201ccentral theme\u201d of the State\u2019s\ncase\u2014presumably because of the highly ambiguous nature\nof the semen evidence recounted above. The Tennessee\nSupreme Court did not mention that evidence in catalog\ning the \u201c[p]articularly incriminating\u201d or \u201c[d]amaging\u201d\nevidence against House. App. 135. The State did not\nmention the semen evidence in its opening statement to\nthe jury, instead focusing on premeditation. 4 Tr. 613\u2013\n615. The defense used its opening statement to expose\nlack of motive as a weakness in the State\u2019s case. Id., at\n628. After the State\u2019s equivocal presentation of the semen\nevidence through Agent Bigbee\u2019s testimony at trial, the\nState again made no reference to the semen evidence or to\na motive in its closing argument, prompting the defense to\nagain highlight this omission. 9 id., at 1274 (\u201c[W]hy was\nCarolyn Muncey killed? We don\u2019t know. Is it important to\nhave some motive? In your minds? What motive did Paul\nGregory House have to go over and kill a woman that he\nbarely knew? Who was still dressed, still clad in her\nclothes\u201d).\n16                      HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n  In rebuttal, the State disclaimed any responsibility\nto prove motive, again shifting the jury\u2019s focus to\npremeditation:\n     \u201cThe law says that if you take another person\u2019s life,\n     you beat them, you strangle them, and then you don\u2019t\n     succeed, and then you kill them by giving them multi\n     ple blows to the head, and one massive blow to the\n     head, and that that causes their brains to crash\n     against the other side of their skull, and caused such\n     severe bleeding inside the skull itself, that you die\u2014\n     that it does not make any difference under God\u2019s\n     heaven, what the motive was. That is what the law\n     is. The law is that if motive is shown, it can be con\n     sidered by the jury as evidence of guilt. But the law is\n     that if you prove that a killing was done, beyond a\n     reasonable doubt, by a person, and that he premedi\n     tated it, he planned it, it is not necessary for the jury\n     to conclude why he did it.\u201d App. 106.\n  As a follow-up to this explanation, when the trial was\nalmost over and only in response to the defense\u2019s consis\ntent prodding, the State made its first and only reference\nto a possible motive, followed immediately by another\ndisclaimer:\n        \u201cNow, you may have an idea why he did it. The evi\n     dence at the scene which seemed to suggest that he\n     was subjecting this lady to some kind of indignity,\n     why would you get a lady out of her house, late at\n     night, in her night clothes, under the trick that her\n     husband has had a wreck down by the creek? . . . Why\n     is it that you choke her? Why is it that you repeatedly\n     beat her? Why is it that she has scrapes all over her\n     body? Well, it is because either you don\u2019t want her to\n     tell what indignities you have subjected her to, or she\n     is unwilling and fights against you, against being sub\n     jected to those indignities. . . . That is what the evi\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)          17\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n    dence at the scene suggests about motive. But motive\n    is not an element of the crime. It is something that\n    you can consider, or ignore. Whatever you prefer.\n    The issue is not motive. The issue is premeditation.\u201d\n    Id., at 106\u2013107.\n   It is on this \u201cobliqu[e]\u201d reference to the semen evidence\nduring the State\u2019s closing argument that the majority\nbases its assertion that House\u2019s sexual motive was a \u201ccen\ntral theme in the State\u2019s narrative.\u201d Ante, at 11, 21.\nAlthough it is possible that one or even some jurors might\nhave entertained doubt about House\u2019s guilt absent the\nclearest evidence of motive, I do not find it more likely\nthan not that every juror would have done so, and that is\nthe legal standard under Schlup. The majority aphoristi\ncally states that \u201c[w]hen identity is in question, motive is\nkey.\u201d Ante, at 21. Not at all. Sometimes, when identity is\nin question, alibi is key. Here, House came up with one\u2014\nand it fell apart, later admitted to be fabricated when his\ngirlfriend would not lie to protect him. Scratches from a\ncat, indeed. Surely a reasonable juror would give the fact\nthat an alibi had been made up and discredited significant\nweight. People facing a murder charge, who are innocent,\ndo not make up a story out of concern that the truth might\nsomehow disturb their parole officer. And people do not\nlie to the police about which jeans they were wearing the\nnight of a murder, if they have no reason to believe the\njeans would be stained with the blood shed by the victim\nin her last desperate struggle to live.\n   In Schlup, we made clear that the standard we adopted\nrequires a \u201cstronger showing than that needed to establish\nprejudice.\u201d 513 U. S., at 327. In other words, House must\nshow more than just a \u201creasonable probability that . . . the\nfactfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting\nguilt.\u201d Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 695 (1984).\nHouse must present such compelling evidence of innocence\n18                     HOUSE v. BELL\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nthat it becomes more likely than not that no single juror,\nacting reasonably, would vote to convict him. Schlup,\nsupra, at 329. The majority\u2019s conclusion is that given the\nsisters\u2019 testimony (if believed), and Dr. Blake\u2019s rebutted\ntestimony about how to interpret Agent Bigbee\u2019s enzyme\nmarker analysis summary (if accepted), combined with the\nrevelation that the semen on Mrs. Muncey\u2019s clothing was\ndeposited by her husband (which the jurors knew was just\nas likely as the semen having been deposited by House),\nno reasonable juror would vote to convict House. Ante, at\n34. Given the District Court\u2019s reliability findings about\nthe first two pieces of evidence, the evidence before us now\nis not substantially different from that considered by\nHouse\u2019s jury. I therefore find it more likely than not that\nin light of this new evidence, at least one juror, acting\nreasonably, would vote to convict House. The evidence as\na whole certainly does not establish that House is actually\ninnocent of the crime of murdering Carolyn Muncey, and\naccordingly I dissent.\n",

A jury convicted petitioner Paul Gregory House of the crime and sentenced him to death, but new revelations cast doubt on the jury's verdict. House, protesting his innocence, seeks access to federal court to pursue <span class=\"star-pagination\">*522</span> habeas corpus relief based on constitutional claims that are procedurally barred under state law. Out of respect for the finality of state-court judgments federal habeas courts, as a general rule, are closed to claims that state courts would consider defaulted. In certain exceptional cases involving a compelling claim of actual innocence, however, the state procedural default rule is not a bar to a federal habeas corpus petition. See <i>Schlup</i> v. <i>Delo,</i> 513 U. S. 298, 319-322 (1995). After careful review of the full record, we conclude that House has made the stringent showing required by this exception; and we hold that his federal habeas action may proceed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>We begin with the facts surrounding Mrs. Muncey's disappearance, the discovery of her body, and House's arrest. Around 3 p.m. on Sunday, July 14, 1985, two local residents found her body concealed amid brush and tree branches on an embankment roughly 100 yards up the road from her driveway. Mrs. Muncey had been seen last on the evening before, when, around 8 p.m., she and her two children\u0097Lora Muncey, aged 10, and Matthew Muncey, aged 8\u0097visited their neighbor, Pam Luttrell. According to Luttrell, Mrs. Muncey mentioned her husband, William Hubert Muncey, Jr., known in the community as \"Little Hube\" and to his family as \"Bubbie.\" As Luttrell recounted Mrs. Muncey's comment, Mr. Muncey \"had gone to dig a grave, and he hadn't come back, but that was all right, because [Mrs. Muncey] was going to make him take her fishing the next day,\" App. 11-12. Mrs. Muncey returned home, and some time later, before 11 p.m. at the latest, Luttrell \"heard a car rev its motor as it went down the road,\" something Mr. Muncey customarily did when he drove by on his way home. Record, Addendum 4, 5 Tr. of Evidence in No. 378 (Crim. Ct. Union Cty., Tenn.), pp. 641-642 (hereinafter Tr.). Luttrell then went to bed.</p>\n<p>Around 1 a.m., Lora and Matthew returned to Luttrell's home, this time with their father, Mr. Muncey, who said his <span class=\"star-pagination\">*523</span> wife was missing. Muncey asked Luttrell to watch the children while he searched for his wife. After he left, Luttrell talked with Lora. According to Luttrell:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[Lora] said she heard a horn blow, she thought she heard a horn blow, and somebody asked if Bubbie was home, and her mama, you know, told them\u0097no. And then she said she didn't know if she went back to sleep or not, but then she heard her mama going down the steps crying and I am not sure if that is when that she told me that she heard her mama say\u0097oh God, no, not me, or if she told me that the next day, but I do know that she said she heard her mother going down the steps crying.\" App. 14-15.</blockquote>\n<p>While Lora was talking, Luttrell recalled, \"Matt kept butting in, you know, on us talking, and he said\u0097sister they said daddy had a wreck, they said daddy had a wreck.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 13.</p>\n<p>At House's trial, Lora repeated her account of the night's events, this time referring to the \"wreck\" her brother had mentioned. To assist in understanding Lora's account, it should be noted that Mrs. Muncey's father-in-law\u0097Little Hube's father\u0097was sometimes called \"Big Hube.\" Lora and her brother called him \"Paw Paw.\" We refer to him as Mr. Muncey, Sr. According to Lora, Mr. Muncey, Sr., had a deep voice, as does petitioner House.</p>\n<p>Lora testified that after leaving Luttrell's house with her mother, she and her brother \"went to bed.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 18. Later, she heard someone, or perhaps two different people, ask for her mother. Lora's account of the events after she went to bed was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Q Laura <i>[sic],</i> at some point after you got back home and you went to bed, did anything happen that caused your mother to be upset or did you hear anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"A Well, it sounded like PawPaw said\u0097where's daddy at, and she said digging a grave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*524</span> \"Q Okay. Do you know if it was PawPaw or not, or did it sound like PawPaw?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"A It just sounded like PawPaw.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Q And your mother told him what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"A That he was digging a grave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Q Had you ever heard that voice before that said that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"A I don't remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Q After that, at some point later, did you hear anything else that caused your mother to be upset?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"A Well, they said that daddy had a wreck down the road and she started crying\u0097next to the creek.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Q Your mother started crying. What was it that they said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"A That daddy had a wreck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Q Did they say where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"A Down there next to the creek.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 18-19.</blockquote>\n<p>Lora did not describe hearing any struggle. Some time later, Lora and her brother left the house to look for their mother, but no one answered when they knocked at the Luttrells' home, and another neighbor, Mike Clinton, said he had not seen her. After the children returned home, according to Lora, her father came home and \"fixed him a bologna sandwich and he took a bit of it and he says\u0097sissy, where is mommy at, and I said\u0097she ain't been here for a little while.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 20. Lora recalled that Mr. Muncey went outside and, not seeing his wife, returned to take Lora and Matthew to the Luttrells' so that he could look further.</p>\n<p>The next afternoon Billy Ray Hensley, the victim's first cousin, heard of Mrs. Muncey's disappearance and went to look for Mr. Muncey. As he approached the Munceys' street, Hensley allegedly \"saw Mr. House come out from under a bank, wiping his hands on a black rag.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 32. Just when and where Hensley saw House, and how well he could <span class=\"star-pagination\">*525</span> have observed him, were disputed at House's trial. Hensley admitted on cross-examination that he could not have seen House \"walking up or climbing up\" the embankment, <i>id.,</i> at 39; rather, he saw House, in \"[j]ust a glance,\" <i>id.,</i> at 40, \"appear out of nowhere,\" \"next to the embankment,\" <i>id.,</i> at 39. On the Munceys' street, opposite the area where Hensley said he saw House, a white Plymouth was parked near a sawmill. Another witness, Billy Hankins, whom the defense called, claimed that around the same time he saw a \"boy\" walking down the street away from the parked Plymouth and toward the Munceys' home. This witness, however, put the \"boy\" on the side of the street with the parked car and the Munceys' driveway, not the side with the embankment.</p>\n<p>Hensley, after turning onto the Munceys' street, continued down the road and turned into their driveway. \"I pulled up in the driveway where I could see up toward Little Hube's house,\" Hensley testified, \"and I seen Little Hube's car wasn't there, and I backed out in the road, and come back [the other way].\" <i>Id.,</i> at 32. As he traveled up the road, Hensley saw House traveling in the opposite direction in the white Plymouth. House \"flagged [Hensley] down\" through his windshield, <i>ibid.,</i> and the two cars met about 300 feet up the road from the Munceys' driveway. According to Hensley, House said he had heard Mrs. Muncey was missing and was looking for her husband. <i>Id.,</i> at 33. Though House had only recently moved to the area, he was acquainted with the Munceys, had attended a dance with them, and had visited their home. He later told law enforcement officials he considered both of the Munceys his friends. According to Hensley, House said he had heard that Mrs. Muncey's husband, who was an alcoholic, was elsewhere \"getting drunk.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>As Hensley drove off, he \"got to thinking to [him]self\u0097he's hunting Little Hube, and Little Hube drunk\u0097what would he be doing off that bank ... .\" <i>Ibid.</i> His suspicion aroused, Hensley later returned to the Munceys' street with a friend named Jack Adkins. The two checked different spots on the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*526</span> embankment, and though Hensley saw nothing where he looked, Adkins found Mrs. Muncey. Her body lay across from the sawmill near the corner where House's car had been parked, dumped in the woods a short way down the bank leading toward a creek.</p>\n<p>Around midnight, Dr. Alex Carabia, a practicing pathologist and county medical examiner, performed an autopsy. Dr. Carabia put the time of death between 9 and 11 p.m. Mrs. Muncey had a black eye, both her hands were bloodstained up to the wrists, and she had bruises on her legs and neck. Dr. Carabia described the bruises as consistent with a \"traumatic origin,\" <i>i. e.,</i> a fight or a fall on hard objects. 7 Tr. 985-986. Based on the neck bruises and other injuries, he concluded Mrs. Muncey had been choked, but he ruled this out as the cause of death. The cause of death, in Dr. Carabia's view, was a severe blow to the left forehead that inflicted both a laceration penetrating to the bone and, inside the skull, a severe right-side hemorrhage, likely caused by Mrs. Muncey's brain slamming into the skull opposite the impact. Dr. Carabia described this head injury as consistent either with receiving a blow from a fist or other instrument or with striking some object.</p>\n<p>The county sheriff, informed about Hensley's earlier encounter with House, questioned House shortly after the body was found. That evening, House answered further questions during a voluntary interview at the local jail. Special Agent Ray Presnell of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) prepared a statement of House's answers, which House signed. Asked to describe his whereabouts on the previous evening, House claimed\u0097falsely, as it turned out\u0097 that he spent the entire evening with his girlfriend, Donna Turner, at her trailer. Asked whether he was wearing the same pants he had worn the night before, House replied\u0097 again, falsely\u0097that he was. House was on probation at the time, having recently been released on parole following a sentence of five years to life for aggravated sexual assault in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*527</span> Utah. House had scratches on his arms and hands, and a knuckle on his right ring finger was bruised. He attributed the scratches to Turner's cats and the finger injury to recent construction work tearing down a shed. The next day House gave a similar statement to a different TBI agent, Charles Scott.</p>\n<p>In fact House had not been at Turner's home. After initially supporting House's alibi, Turner informed authorities that House left her trailer around 10:30 or 10:45 p.m. to go for a walk. According to Turner's trial testimony, House returned later\u0097she was not sure when\u0097hot and panting, missing his shirt and his shoes. House, Turner testified, told her that while he was walking on the road near her home, a vehicle pulled up beside him, and somebody inside \"called him some names and then they told him he didn't belong here anymore.\" App. 89. House said he tried to ignore the taunts and keep walking, but the vehicle pulled in behind him, and \"one of them got out and grabbed him by the shoulder... and [House] swung around with his right hand\" and \"hit something.\" <i>Ibid.</i> According to Turner, House said \"he took off down the bank and started running and he said that he\u0097he said it seemed forever where he was running. And he said they fired two shots at him while he took off down the bank ... .\" <i>Ibid.</i> House claimed the assailants \"grabbed ahold of his shirt,\" which Turner remembered as \"a blue tank top, trimmed in yellow,\" and \"they tore it to where it wouldn't stay on him and he said\u0097I just throwed it off when I was running.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 91. Turner, noticing House's bruised knuckle, asked how he hurt it, and House told her \"that's where he hit.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 90. Turner testified that she \"thought maybe my ex-husband had something to do with it.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Although the white Plymouth House drove the next day belonged to Turner, Turner insisted House had not used the car that night. No forensic evidence connected the car to the crime; law enforcement officials inspected a white towel <span class=\"star-pagination\">*528</span> covering the driver seat and concluded it was clean. Turner's trailer was located just under two miles by road, through hilly terrain, from the Muncey residence.</p>\n<p>Law enforcement officers also questioned the victim's husband. Though Mrs. Muncey's comments to Luttrell gave no indication she knew this, Mr. Muncey had spent the evening at a weekly dance at a recreation center roughly a mile and a half from his home. In his statement to law enforcement\u0097a statement House's trial counsel claims he never saw\u0097 Mr. Muncey admitted leaving the dance early, but said it was only for a brief trip to the package store to buy beer. He also stated that he and his wife had had sexual relations Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>Late in the evening on Monday, July 15\u0097two days after the murder\u0097law enforcement officers visited Turner's trailer. With Turner's consent, Agent Scott seized the pants House was wearing the night Mrs. Muncey disappeared. The heavily soiled pants were sitting in a laundry hamper; years later, Agent Scott recalled noticing \"reddish brown stains\" he \"suspected\" were blood. <i>Id.,</i> at 274-275. Around 4 p.m. the next day, two local law enforcement officers set out for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington, D. C., with House's pants, blood samples from the autopsy, and other evidence packed together in a box. They arrived at 2 a.m. the next morning. On July 17, after initial FBI testing revealed human blood on the pants, House was arrested.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The State of Tennessee charged House with capital murder. At House's trial, the State presented testimony by Luttrell, Hensley, Adkins, Lora Muncey, Dr. Carabia, the sheriff, and other law enforcement officials. Through TBI Agents Presnell and Scott, the jury learned of House's false statements. Central to the State's case, however, was what the FBI testing showed\u0097that semen consistent (or so it seemed) with House's was present on Mrs. Muncey's nightgown <span class=\"star-pagination\">*529</span> and panties, and that small bloodstains consistent with Mrs. Muncey's blood but not House's appeared on the jeans belonging to House.</p>\n<p>Regarding the semen, FBI Special Agent Paul Bigbee, a serologist, testified that the source was a \"secretor,\" meaning someone who \"secrete[s] the ABO blood group substances in other body fluids, such as semen and saliva\"\u0097a characteristic shared by 80 percent of the population, including House. <i>Id.,</i> at 55. Agent Bigbee further testified that the source of semen on the gown was blood-type A, House's own blood type. As to the semen on the panties, Agent Bigbee found only the H blood-group substance, which A and B blood-type secretors secrete along with substances A and B, and which O-type secretors secrete exclusively. Agent Bigbee explained, however\u0097using science an <i>amicus</i> here sharply disputes, see Brief for Innocence Project, Inc., as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 24-26\u0097that House's A antigens could have \"degraded\" into H, App. 57-58. Agent Bigbee thus concluded that both semen deposits could have come from House, though he acknowledged that the H antigen could have come from Mrs. Muncey herself if she was a secretor\u0097something he \"was not able to determine,\" <i>id.,</i> at 58\u0097and that, while Mr. Muncey was himself blood-type A (as was his wife), Agent Bigbee was again \"not able to determine his secretor status,\" <i>id.,</i> at 57. Agent Bigbee acknowledged on cross-examination that \"a saliva sample\" would have sufficed to determine whether Mr. Muncey was a secretor; the State did not provide such a sample, though it did provide samples of Mr. Muncey's blood. <i>Id.,</i> at 62.</p>\n<p>As for the blood, Agent Bigbee explained that \"spots of blood\" appeared \"on the left outside leg, the right bottom cuff, on the left thigh and in the right inside pocket and on the lower pocket on the outside.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 48. Agent Bigbee determined that the blood's source was type A (the type shared by House, the victim, and Mr. Muncey). He also successfully tested for the enzyme phosphoglucomutase and the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*530</span> blood serum haptoglobin, both of which \"are found in all humans\" and carry \"slight chemical differences\" that vary genetically and \"can be grouped to differentiate between two individuals if those types are different.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 49-50. Based on these chemical traces and on the A blood type, Agent Bigbee determined that only some 6.75 percent of the population carry similar blood, that the blood was \"consistent\" with Mrs. Muncey's (as determined by testing autopsy samples), and that it was \"impossible\" that the blood came from House. <i>Id.,</i> at 48-52.</p>\n<p>A different FBI expert, Special Agent Chester Blythe, testified about fiber analysis performed on Mrs. Muncey's clothes and on House's pants. Although Agent Blythe found blue jean fibers on Mrs. Muncey's nightgown, brassiere, housecoat, and panties, and in fingernail scrapings taken from her body (scrapings that also contained trace, unidentifiable amounts of blood), he acknowledged that, as the prosecutor put it in questioning the witness, \"blue jean material is common material,\" so \"this doesn't mean that the fibers that were all over the victim's clothing were necessarily from [House's] pair of blue jeans.\" 6 Tr. 864-865. On House's pants, though cotton garments both transfer and retain fibers readily, Agent Blythe found neither hair nor fiber consistent with the victim's hair or clothing.</p>\n<p>In the defense case House called Hankins, Clinton, and Turner, as well as House's mother, who testified that House had talked to her by telephone around 9:30 p.m. on the night of the murder and that he had not used her car that evening. House also called the victim's brother, Ricky Green, as a witness. Green testified that on July 2, roughly two weeks before the murder, Mrs. Muncey called him and \"said her and Little Hube had been into it and she said she was wanting to leave Little Hube, she said she was wanting to get out\u0097 out of it, and she was scared.\" 7 <i>id.,</i> at 1088. Green recalled that at Christmastime in 1982 he had seen Mr. Muncey strike Mrs. Muncey after returning home drunk.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*531</span> As Turner informed the jury, House's shoes were found several months after the crime in a field near her home. Turner delivered them to authorities. Though the jury did not learn of this fact (and House's counsel claims he did not either), the State tested the shoes for blood and found none. House's shirt was not found.</p>\n<p>The State's closing argument suggested that on the night of her murder, Mrs. Muncey \"was deceived ... . She had been told [her husband] had had an accident.\" 9 <i>id.,</i> at 1226. The prosecutor emphasized the FBI's blood analysis, noting that \"after running many, many, many tests,\" Agent Bigbee</p>\n<blockquote>\"was able to tell you that the blood on the defendant's blue jeans was not his own blood, could not be his own blood. He told you that the blood on the blue jeans was consistent with every characteristic in every respect of the deceased's, Carolyn Muncey's, and that ninety-three (93%) percent of the white population would not have that blood type... . He can't tell you one hundred (100%) percent for certain that it was her blood. But folks, he can sure give you a pretty good\u0097a pretty good indication.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1235-1236.</blockquote>\n<p>In the State's rebuttal, after defense counsel questioned House's motive \"to go over and kill a woman that he barely knew[,] [w]ho was still dressed, still clad in her clothes,\" <i>id.,</i> at 1274, the prosecutor referred obliquely to the semen stains. While explaining that legally \"it does not make any difference under God's heaven, what the motive was,\" App. 106, the prosecutor told the jury, \"you may have an idea why he did it,\" <i>ibid.:</i></p>\n<blockquote>\"The evidence at the scene which seemed to suggest that he was subjecting this lady to some kind of indignity, why would you get a lady out of her house, late at night, in her night clothes, under the trick that her husband has had a wreck down by the creek? ... Well, it is because either you don't want her to tell what indignities <span class=\"star-pagination\">*532</span> you have subjected her to, or she is unwilling and fights against you, against being subjected to those indignities. In other words, it is either to keep her from telling what you have done to her, or it is that you are trying to get her to do something that she nor any mother on that road would want to do with Mr. House, under those conditions, and you kill her because of her resistance. That is what the evidence at the scene suggests about motive.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 106-107.</blockquote>\n<p>In addition the government suggested the black rag Hensley said he saw in House's hands was in fact the missing blue tank top, retrieved by House from the crime scene. And the prosecution reiterated the importance of the blood. \"[D]efense counsel,\" he said, \"does not start out discussing the fact that his client had blood on his jeans on the night that Carolyn Muncey was killed... . He doesn't start with the fact that nothing that the defense has introduced in this case explains what blood is doing on his jeans, all over his jeans, that is scientifically, completely different from his blood.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 104-105. The jury found House guilty of murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p>The trial advanced to the sentencing phase. As aggravating factors to support a capital sentence, the State sought to prove: (1) that House had previously been convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence; (2) that the homicide was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that it involved torture or depravity of mind; and (3) that the murder was committed while House was committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing from the commission of, rape or kidnaping. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 39-2-203(i)(2), (5), (7) (1982) (repealed 1989); cf. \u00a7\u00a7 39-13-204(i)(2), (5), (7) (2003). After presenting evidence of House's parole status and aggravated sexual assault conviction, the State rested. As mitigation, the defense offered testimony from House's father and mother, as well as evidence, presented through House's mother, that House attempted suicide after the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*533</span> guilt-phase verdict. Before the attempt House wrote his mother a letter professing his innocence.</p>\n<p>In closing the State urged the jury to find all three aggravating factors and impose death. As to the kidnaping or rape factor, the prosecution suggested Mrs. Muncey was \"decoy[ed] or entic[ed] ... away from her family, and confin[ed] against her will because you know that as she was being beaten to death.\" 10 Tr. 1410. \"We also think,\" the prosecutor added, \"the proof shows strong evidence of attempted sexual molestation of the victim to accompany the taking away and murdering her.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1410-1411. Later the prosecutor argued, \"I think the proof shows in the record that it is more likely than not that having been through the process before and having been convicted of a crime involving the threat of violence, or violence to another person, aggravated sexual assault, that the defendant cannot benefit from the type of rehabilitation that correction departments can provide.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1413. The jury unanimously found all three aggravating factors and concluded \"there are no mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to outweigh the statutory aggravating circumstance or circumstances.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1454. The jury recommended a death sentence, which the trial judge imposed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed House's conviction and sentence, describing the evidence against House as \"circumstantial\" but \"quite strong.\" <i>State</i> v. <i>House,</i> 743 S. W. 2d 141, 143, 144 (1987). Two months later, in a state trial court, House filed a <i>pro se</i> petition for postconviction relief, arguing he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. The court-appointed counsel amended the petition to raise other issues, including a challenge to certain jury instructions. At a hearing before the same judge who conducted the trial, House's counsel offered no proof beyond the trial transcript. The trial court dismissed the petition, deeming House's trial counsel adequate and overruling <span class=\"star-pagination\">*534</span> House's other objections. On appeal House's attorney renewed only the jury-instructions argument. In an unpublished opinion the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, and both the Tennessee Supreme Court and this Court, <i>House</i> v. <i>Tennessee,</i> 498 U. S. 912 (1990), denied review.</p>\n<p>House filed a second postconviction petition in state court reasserting his ineffective-assistance claim and seeking investigative and/or expert assistance. After extensive litigation regarding whether House's claims were procedurally defaulted the Tennessee Supreme Court held that House's claims were barred under a state statute providing that claims not raised in prior postconviction proceedings are presumptively waived, Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-30-112 (1990) (repealed 1995), and that courts may not consider grounds for relief \"which the court finds should be excluded because they have been waived or previously determined,\" \u00a7 40-30-111 (repealed 1995). See <i>House</i> v. <i>State,</i> 911 S. W. 2d 705 (1995). This Court denied certiorari. <i>House</i> v. <i>Tennessee,</i> 517 U. S. 1193 (1996).</p>\n<p>House next sought federal habeas relief, asserting numerous claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, though deeming House's claims procedurally defaulted and granting summary judgment to the State on the majority of House's claims, held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether House fell within the \"actual innocence\" exception to procedural default that this Court recognized as to substantive offenses in <i>Schlup</i> and as to death sentences in <i>Sawyer</i> v. <i>Whitley,</i> 505 U. S. 333 (1992). Presenting evidence we describe in greater detail below, House attacked the semen and blood evidence used at his trial and presented other evidence, including a putative confession, suggesting that Mr. Muncey, not House, committed the murder. The District Court nevertheless denied relief, holding that House had neither demonstrated actual <span class=\"star-pagination\">*535</span> innocence of the murder under <i>Schlup</i> nor established that he was ineligible for the death penalty under <i>Sawyer.</i></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted a certificate of appealability under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2253(c) as to all claims in the habeas petition. On the merits a divided panel affirmed, but its opinion was withdrawn and the case taken en banc. A divided en banc court certified state-law questions to the Tennessee Supreme Court. <i>House</i> v. <i>Bell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779947\"><a href=\"/opinion/779947/paul-gregory-house-v-ricky-bell-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">767</span></a></span> (CA6 2002). Concluding that House had made a compelling showing of actual innocence, and recognizing that in <i>Herrera</i> v. <i>Collins,</i> 506 U. S. 390 (1993), this Court assumed without deciding that \"in a capital case a truly persuasive demonstration of `actual innocence' made after trial would render the execution of a defendant unconstitutional, and warrant federal habeas relief if there were no state avenue open to process such a claim,\" <i>id.,</i> at 417, the six-judge majority certified questions to the State Supreme Court, 311 F. 3d, at 777-778. The questions sought \"to ascertain whether there remains a `state avenue open to process such a claim' in this case.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 768. Four dissenting judges argued the court should have reached the merits, rather than certifying questions to the state court; these judges asserted that House could not obtain relief under <i>Schlup,</i> let alone <i>Sawyer</i> and <i>Herrera.</i> 311 F. 3d, at 780-781 (opinion of Boggs, J.). A fifth dissenter explained that while he agreed with the majority that House \"presents a strong claim for habeas relief, at least at the sentencing phase of the case,\" he objected to the certification of questions to the Tennessee high court. <i>Id.,</i> at 787 (opinion of Gilman, J.). This Court denied certiorari. <i>Bell</i> v. <i>House,</i> 539 U. S. 937 (2003).</p>\n<p>The State urged the Tennessee Supreme Court not to answer the Court of Appeals' certified questions, and the state court did not do so. The case returned to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. This time an eight-judge majority affirmed the District Court's denial of habeas <span class=\"star-pagination\">*536</span> relief. 386 F. 3d 668 (2004). Six dissenters argued that House not only had met the actual-innocence standard for overcoming procedural default but also was entitled to immediate release under <i>Herrera.</i> 386 F. 3d, at 708 (opinion of Merritt, J.). A seventh dissenter (the same judge who wrote separately in the previous en banc decision) described the case as \"a real-life murder mystery, an authentic `who-done-it' where the wrong man may be executed.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 709 (opinion of Gilman, J.). He concluded such grave uncertainty necessitated relief in the form of a new trial for House. <i>Id.,</i> at 710.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 545 U. S. 1151 (2005), and now reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>As a general rule, claims forfeited under state law may support federal habeas relief only if the prisoner demonstrates cause for the default and prejudice from the asserted error. See <i>Murray</i> v. <i>Carrier,</i> 477 U. S. 478, 485 (1986); <i>Engle</i> v. <i>Isaac,</i> 456 U. S. 107, 129 (1982); <i>Wainwright</i> v. <i>Sykes,</i> 433 U. S. 72, 87 (1977). The rule is based on the comity and respect that must be accorded to state-court judgments. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Engle, supra,</i> at 126-129; <i>Wainwright, supra,</i> at 89-90. The bar is not, however, unqualified. In an effort to \"balance the societal interests in finality, comity, and conservation of scarce judicial resources with the individual interest in justice that arises in the extraordinary case,\" <i>Schlup,</i> 513 U. S., at 324, the Court has recognized a miscarriage-of-justice exception. \"`[I]n appropriate cases,'\" the Court has said, \"the principles of comity and finality that inform the concepts of cause and prejudice `must yield to the imperative of correcting a fundamentally unjust incarceration,'\" <i>Carrier, supra,</i> at 495 (quoting <i>Engle, supra,</i> at 135).</p>\n<p>In <i>Schlup,</i> the Court adopted a specific rule to implement this general principle. It held that prisoners asserting innocence as a gateway to defaulted claims must establish that, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*537</span> in light of new evidence, \"it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 513 U. S., at 327. This formulation, <i>Schlup</i> explains, \"ensures that petitioner's case is truly `extraordinary,' while still providing petitioner a meaningful avenue by which to avoid a manifest injustice.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>McCleskey</i> v. <i>Zant,</i> 499 U. S. 467, 494 (1991)). In the usual case the presumed guilt of a prisoner convicted in state court counsels against federal review of defaulted claims. Yet a petition supported by a convincing <i>Schlup</i> gateway showing \"raise[s] sufficient doubt about [the petitioner's] guilt to undermine confidence in the result of the trial without the assurance that that trial was untainted by constitutional error\"; hence, \"a review of the merits of the constitutional claims\" is justified. 513 U. S., at 317.</p>\n<p>For purposes of this case several features of the <i>Schlup</i> standard bear emphasis. First, although \"[t]o be credible\" a gateway claim requires \"new reliable evidence\u0097whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence\u0097that was not presented at trial,\" <i>id.,</i> at 324, the habeas court's analysis is not limited to such evidence. There is no dispute in this case that House has presented some new reliable evidence; the State has conceded as much, see <i>infra,</i> at 540-541. In addition, because the District Court held an evidentiary hearing in this case, and because the State does not challenge the court's decision to do so, we have no occasion to elaborate on <i>Schlup</i>'s observation that when considering an actual-innocence claim in the context of a request for an evidentiary hearing, the District Court need not \"test the new evidence by a standard appropriate for deciding a motion for summary judgment,\" but rather may \"consider how the timing of the submission and the likely credibility of the affiants bear on the probable reliability of that evidence.\" 513 U. S., at 331-332. Our review in this case addresses the merits of the <i>Schlup</i> inquiry, based on a fully developed record, and with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*538</span> respect to that inquiry <i>Schlup</i> makes plain that the habeas court must consider \"`all the evidence,'\" old and new, incriminating and exculpatory, without regard to whether it would necessarily be admitted under \"rules of admissibility that would govern at trial.\" See <i>id.,</i> at 327-328 (quoting Friendly, Is Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack on Criminal Judgments, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev. 142, 160 (1970)). Based on this total record, the court must make \"a probabilistic determination about what reasonable, properly instructed jurors would do.\" 513 U. S., at 329. The court's function is not to make an independent factual determination about what likely occurred, but rather to assess the likely impact of the evidence on reasonable jurors. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Second, it bears repeating that the <i>Schlup</i> standard is demanding and permits review only in the \"`extraordinary'\" case. <i>Id.,</i> at 327 (quoting <i>Zant, supra,</i> at 494); see also 513 U. S., at 324 (emphasizing that \"in the vast majority of cases, claims of actual innocence are rarely successful\"). At the same time, though, the <i>Schlup</i> standard does not require absolute certainty about the petitioner's guilt or innocence. A petitioner's burden at the gateway stage is to demonstrate that more likely than not, in light of the new evidence, no reasonable juror would find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\u0097or, to remove the double negative, that more likely than not any reasonable juror would have reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>Finally, as the <i>Schlup</i> decision explains, the gateway actual-innocence standard is \"by no means equivalent to the standard of <i>Jackson</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 443 U. S. 307 (1979),\" which governs claims of insufficient evidence. <i>Id.,</i> at 330. When confronted with a challenge based on trial evidence, courts presume the jury resolved evidentiary disputes reasonably so long as sufficient evidence supports the verdict. Because a <i>Schlup</i> claim involves evidence the trial jury did not have before it, the inquiry requires the federal court to assess how reasonable jurors would react to the overall, newly supplemented record. See <i>ibid.</i> If new evidence so requires, this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*539</span> may include consideration of \"the credibility of the witnesses presented at trial.\" <i>Ibid.;</i> see also <i>ibid.</i> (noting that \"[i]n such a case, the habeas court may have to make some credibility assessments\").</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, the State argues that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, has replaced the <i>Schlup</i> standard with a stricter test based on <i>Sawyer,</i> which permits consideration of successive, abusive, or defaulted sentencing-related claims only if the petitioner \"show[s] by clear and convincing evidence that, but for a constitutional error, no reasonable juror would have found the petitioner eligible for the death penalty under the applicable state law,\" 505 U. S., at 336. One AEDPA provision establishes a similar standard for second or successive petitions involving no retroactively applicable new law, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii); another sets it as a threshold for obtaining an evidentiary hearing on claims the petitioner failed to develop in state court, \u00a7 2254(e)(2). Neither provision addresses the type of petition at issue here\u0097 a first federal habeas petition seeking consideration of defaulted claims based on a showing of actual innocence. Thus, the standard of review in these provisions is inapplicable. Cf. <i>Lonchar</i> v. <i>Thomas,</i> 517 U. S. 314, 324 (1996) (\"Dismissal of a <i>first</i> federal habeas petition is a particularly serious matter\").</p>\n<p>The State also argues that the District Court's findings in this case tie our hands, precluding a ruling in House's favor absent a showing of clear error as to the District Court's specific determinations. This view overstates the effect of the District Court's ruling. Deference is given to a trial court's assessment of evidence presented to it in the first instance. Yet the <i>Schlup</i> inquiry, we repeat, requires a holistic judgment about \"`all the evidence,'\" 513 U. S., at 328 (quoting Friendly, <i>supra,</i> at 160), and its likely effect on reasonable jurors applying the reasonable-doubt standard. As a general rule, the inquiry does not turn on discrete findings <span class=\"star-pagination\">*540</span> regarding disputed points of fact, and \"[i]t is not the district court's independent judgment as to whether reasonable doubt exists that the standard addresses,\" 513 U. S., at 329. Here, although the District Court attentively managed complex proceedings, carefully reviewed the extensive record, and drew certain conclusions about the evidence, the court did not clearly apply <i>Schlup</i>'s predictive standard regarding whether reasonable jurors would have reasonable doubt. As we shall explain, moreover, we are uncertain about the basis for some of the District Court's conclusions\u0097a consideration that weakens our reliance on its determinations.</p>\n<p>With this background in mind we turn to the evidence developed in House's federal habeas proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>DNA Evidence</i></h2>\n<p>First, in direct contradiction of evidence presented at trial, DNA testing has established that the semen on Mrs. Muncey's nightgown and panties came from her husband, Mr. Muncey, not from House. The State, though conceding this point, insists this new evidence is immaterial. At the guilt phase at least, neither sexual contact nor motive were elements of the offense, so in the State's view the evidence, or lack of evidence, of sexual assault or sexual advance is of no consequence. We disagree. In fact we consider the new disclosure of central importance.</p>\n<p>From beginning to end the case is about who committed the crime. When identity is in question, motive is key. The point, indeed, was not lost on the prosecution, for it introduced the evidence and relied on it in the final guilt-phase closing argument. Referring to \"evidence at the scene,\" the prosecutor suggested that House committed, or attempted to commit, some \"indignity\" on Mrs. Muncey that neither she \"nor any mother on that road would want to do with Mr. House.\" 9 Tr. 1302-1303. Particularly in a case like this where the proof was, as the State Supreme Court observed, circumstantial, <i>State</i> v. <i>House,</i> 743 S. W. 2d, at 143, 144, we <span class=\"star-pagination\">*541</span> think a jury would have given this evidence great weight. Quite apart from providing proof of motive, it was the only forensic evidence at the scene that would link House to the murder.</p>\n<p>Law and society, as they ought to do, demand accountability when a sexual offense has been committed, so not only did this evidence link House to the crime; it likely was a factor in persuading the jury not to let him go free. At sentencing, moreover, the jury came to the unanimous conclusion, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the murder was committed in the course of a rape or kidnaping. The alleged sexual motivation relates to both those determinations. This is particularly so given that, at the sentencing phase, the jury was advised that House had a previous conviction for sexual assault.</p>\n<p>A jury informed that fluids on Mrs. Muncey's garments could have come from House might have found that House trekked the nearly two miles to the victim's home and lured her away in order to commit a sexual offense. By contrast a jury acting without the assumption that the semen could have come from House would have found it necessary to establish some different motive, or, if the same motive, an intent far more speculative. When the only direct evidence of sexual assault drops out of the case, so, too, does a central theme in the State's narrative linking House to the crime. In that light, furthermore, House's odd evening walk and his false statements to authorities, while still potentially incriminating, might appear less suspicious.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Bloodstains</i></h2>\n<p>The other relevant forensic evidence is the blood on House's pants, which appears in small, even minute, stains in scattered places. As the prosecutor told the jury, they were stains that, due to their small size, \"you or I might not detect[,] [m]ight not see, but which the FBI lab was able to find on [House's] jeans.\" App. 11. The stains appear inside the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*542</span> right pocket, outside that pocket, near the inside button, on the left thigh and outside leg, on the seat of the pants, and on the right bottom cuff, including inside the pants. Due to testing by the FBI, cuttings now appear on the pants in several places where stains evidently were found. (The cuttings were destroyed in the testing process, and defense experts were unable to replicate the tests.) At trial, the government argued \"nothing that the defense has introduced in this case explains what blood is doing on his jeans, all over [House's] jeans, that is scientifically, completely different from his blood.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 105. House, though not disputing at this point that the blood is Mrs. Muncey's, now presents an alternative explanation that, if credited, would undermine the probative value of the blood evidence.</p>\n<p>During House's habeas proceedings, Dr. Cleland Blake, an Assistant Chief Medical Examiner for the State of Tennessee and a consultant in forensic pathology to the TBI for 22 years, testified that the blood on House's pants was chemically too degraded, and too similar to blood collected during the autopsy, to have come from Mrs. Muncey's body on the night of the crime. The blood samples collected during the autopsy were placed in test tubes without preservative. Under such conditions, according to Dr. Blake, \"you will have enzyme degradation. You will have different blood group degradation, blood marker degradation.\" Record, Doc. 275, p. 80 (hereinafter R275:80). The problem of decay, moreover, would have been compounded by the body's long exposure to the elements, sitting outside for the better part of a summer day. In contrast, if blood is preserved on cloth, \"it will stay there for years,\" <i>ibid.;</i> indeed, Dr. Blake said he deliberately places blood drops on gauze during autopsies to preserve it for later testing. The blood on House's pants, judging by Agent Bigbee's tests, showed \"similar deterioration, breakdown of certain of the named numbered enzymes\" as in the autopsy samples. <i>Id.,</i> at 110. \"[I]f the victim's blood had spilled on the jeans while the victim was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*543</span> alive and this blood had dried,\" Dr. Blake stated, \"the deterioration would not have occurred,\" <i>ibid.,</i> and \"you would expect [the blood on the jeans] to be different than what was in the tube,\" <i>id.,</i> at 113. Dr. Blake thus concluded the blood on the jeans came from the autopsy samples, not from Mrs. Muncey's live (or recently killed) body.</p>\n<p>Other evidence confirms that blood did in fact spill from the vials. It appears the vials passed from Dr. Carabia, who performed the autopsy, into the hands of two local law enforcement officers, who transported it to the FBI, where Agent Bigbee performed the enzyme tests. The blood was contained in four vials, evidently with neither preservative nor a proper seal. The vials, in turn, were stored in a styrofoam box, but nothing indicates the box was kept cool. Rather, in what an evidence protocol expert at the habeas hearing described as a violation of proper procedure, the styrofoam box was packed in the same cardboard box as other evidence including House's pants (apparently in a paper bag) and other clothing (in separate bags). The cardboard box was then carried in the officers' car while they made the 10-hour journey from Tennessee to the FBI lab. Dr. Blake stated that blood vials in hot conditions (such as a car trunk in the summer) could blow open; and in fact, by the time the blood reached the FBI it had hemolyzed, or spoiled, due to heat exposure. By the time the blood passed from the FBI to a defense expert, roughly a vial and a half were empty, though Agent Bigbee testified he used at most a quarter of one vial. Blood, moreover, had seeped onto one corner of the styrofoam box and onto packing gauze inside the box below the vials.</p>\n<p>In addition, although the pants apparently were packaged initially in a paper bag and FBI records suggest they arrived at the FBI in one, the record does not contain the paper bag but does contain a plastic bag with a label listing the pants and Agent Scott's name\u0097and the plastic bag has blood on it. The blood appears in a forked streak roughly five inches long <span class=\"star-pagination\">*544</span> and two inches wide running down the bag's outside front. Though testing by House's expert confirmed the stain was blood, the expert could not determine the blood's source. Speculations about when and how the blood got there add to the confusion regarding the origins of the stains on House's pants.</p>\n<p>Faced with these indications of, at best, poor evidence control, the State attempted to establish at the habeas hearing that all blood spillage occurred after Agent Bigbee examined the pants. Were that the case, of course, then blood would have been detected on the pants before any spill\u0097which would tend to undermine Dr. Blake's analysis and support using the bloodstains to infer House's guilt. In support of this theory the State put on testimony by a blood spatter expert who believed the \"majority\" of the stains were \"transfer stains,\" that is, stains resulting from \"wip[ing] across the surface of the pants\" rather than seeping or spillage. App. 293-294. Regarding the spillage in the styrofoam box, the expert noted that yellow \"Tennessee Crime Laboratory\" tape running around the box and down all four sides did not line up when the bloodstains on the box's corner were aligned. The inference was that the FBI received the box from Tennessee authorities, opened it, and resealed it before the spillage occurred. Reinforcing this theory, Agent Bigbee testified that he observed no blood spillage in the styrofoam box and that had he detected such signs of evidence contamination, FBI policy would have required immediate return of the evidence.</p>\n<p>In response House argued that even assuming the tape alignment showed spillage occurring after FBI testing, spillage on one or more earlier occasions was likely. In fact even the State's spatter expert declined to suggest the blood in the box and on the packing gauze accounted for the full vial and a quarter missing. And when the defense expert opened the box and discovered the spills, the bulk of the blood-caked gauze was located around and underneath the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*545</span> half-full vial, which was also located near the stained corner. No gauze immediately surrounding the completely empty vial was stained. The tape, moreover, circled the box in two layers, one underneath the other, and in one spot the underlying layer stops cleanly at the lid's edge, as if cut with a razor, and does not continue onto the body of the box below. In House's view this clean cut suggests the double layers could not have resulted simply from wrapping the tape around twice, as the spatter expert claimed; rather, someone possessing Tennessee Crime Lab tape\u0097perhaps the officers transporting the blood and pants\u0097must have cut the box open and resealed it, possibly creating an opportunity for spillage. Supporting the same inference, a label on the box's lid lists both blood and vaginal secretions as the box's contents, though Agent Bigbee's records show the vaginal fluids arrived at the FBI in a separate envelope. Finally, cross-examination revealed that Agent Bigbee's practice did not always match the letter of FBI policy. Although Mrs. Muncey's bra and housecoat were packed together in a single bag, creating, according to Agent Bigbee, a risk of \"cross contamination,\" <i>id.,</i> at 286, he did not return them; nor did he note the discrepancy between the \"[b]lood and vaginal secretions\" label and the styrofoam box's actual contents, though he insisted his customary practice was to match labels with contents immediately upon opening an evidence box, <i>id.,</i> at 287.</p>\n<p>The State challenged Dr. Blake's scientific conclusions, and to do so it called Agent Bigbee as a witness. Agent Bigbee defended the testimony he had given at the trial. To begin with, he suggested Dr. Blake had misconstrued the term \"inc\" in Agent Bigbee's trial report, interpreting it to mean \"incomplete\" when it in fact meant \"inconclusive.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 254-256, 282. Dr. Blake, however, replied \"[s]ame difference\" when asked whether his opinion would change if \"inc\" meant \"inconclusive.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 256; see also 6 Tr. 906 (Bigbee trial testimony) (\"You will notice I have INC written under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*546</span> the transparent, that is the symbol that I use to mean the test was incomplete\"). Agent Bigbee further asserted that, whereas Dr. Blake (in Bigbee's view) construed the results to mean the enzyme was not present at all, in fact the results indicated only that Bigbee could not identify the marker type on whatever enzymes were present. App. 282. Yet the State did not cross-examine Dr. Blake on this point, nor did the District Court resolve the dispute one way or the other, so on this record it seems possible that Dr. Blake meant only to suggest the blood was too degraded to permit conclusive typing. The State, moreover, does not ask us to question Dr. Blake's basic premise about the durability of blood chemicals deposited on cotton\u0097a premise Agent Bigbee appeared to accept as a general matter. Given the record as it stands, then, we cannot say Dr. Blake's conclusions have been discredited; if other objections might be adduced, they must await further proceedings. At the least, the record before us contains credible testimony suggesting that the missing enzyme markers are generally better preserved on cloth than in poorly kept test tubes, and that principle could support House's spillage theory for the blood's origin.</p>\n<p>In this Court, as a further attack on House's showing, the State suggests that, given the spatter expert's testimony, House's theory would require a jury to surmise that Tennessee officials donned the pants and deliberately spread blood over them. We disagree. This should be a matter for the trier of fact to consider in the first instance, but we can note a line of argument that could refute the State's position. It is correct that the State's spatter expert opined that the stains resulted from wiping or smearing rather than direct spillage; and she further stated that the distribution of stains in some spots suggests the pants were \"folded in some manner or creased in some manner\" when the transfers occurred, <i>id.,</i> at 296. While the expert described this pattern, at least with respect to stains on the lap of the pants, as \"consistent\" with the pants being worn at the time of the staining, <i>ibid.,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*547</span> her testimony, as we understand it, does not refute the hypothesis that the packaging of the pants for transport was what caused them to be folded or creased. It seems permissible, moreover, to conclude that the small size and wide distribution of stains\u0097inside the right pocket, outside that pocket, near the inside button, on the left thigh and outside leg, on the seat of the pants, and on the right bottom cuff, including inside the pants\u0097fits as well with spillage in transport as with wiping and smearing from bloody objects at the crime scene, as the State proposes. (As has been noted, no blood was found on House's shoes.)</p>\n<p>The District Court discounted Dr. Blake's opinion, not on account of Blake's substantive approach, but based on testimony from Agent Scott indicating he saw, as the District Court put it, \"what appeared to be bloodstains on Mr. House's blue jeans when the jeans were removed from the laundry hamper at Ms. Turner's trailer.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 348. This inference seems at least open to question, however. Agent Scott stated only that he \"saw reddish brownish stains [he] suspected to be blood\"; he admitted that he \"didn't thoroughly examine the blue jeans at that time.\" R276:113-114. The pants were in fact extensively soiled with mud and reddish stains, only small portions of which are blood.</p>\n<p>In sum, considering \"`all the evidence,'\" <i>Schlup,</i> 513 U. S., at 328 (quoting Friendly, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev., at 160), on this issue, we think the evidentiary disarray surrounding the blood, taken together with Dr. Blake's testimony and the limited rebuttal of it in the present record, would prevent reasonable jurors from placing significant reliance on the blood evidence. We now know, though the trial jury did not, that an Assistant Chief Medical Examiner believes the blood on House's jeans must have come from autopsy samples; that a vial and a quarter of autopsy blood is unaccounted for; that the blood was transported to the FBI together with the pants in conditions that could have caused vials to spill; that the blood did indeed spill at least once during its journey <span class=\"star-pagination\">*548</span> from Tennessee authorities through FBI hands to a defense expert; that the pants were stored in a plastic bag bearing both a large blood stain and a label with TBI Agent Scott's name; and that the styrofoam box containing the blood samples may well have been opened before it arrived at the FBI lab. Thus, whereas the bloodstains, emphasized by the prosecution, seemed strong evidence of House's guilt at trial, the record now raises substantial questions about the blood's origin.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A Different Suspect</i></h2>\n<p>Were House's challenge to the State's case limited to the questions he has raised about the blood and semen, the other evidence favoring the prosecution might well suffice to bar relief. There is, however, more; for in the post-trial proceedings House presented troubling evidence that Mr. Muncey, the victim's husband, himself could have been the murderer.</p>\n<p>At trial, as has been noted, the jury heard that roughly two weeks before the murder Mrs. Muncey's brother received a frightened phone call from his sister indicating that she and Mr. Muncey had been fighting, that she was scared, and that she wanted to leave him. The jury also learned that the brother once saw Mr. Muncey \"smac[k]\" the victim. 7 Tr. 1087-1088. House now has produced evidence from multiple sources suggesting that Mr. Muncey regularly abused his wife. For example, one witness\u0097Kathy Parker, a lifelong area resident who denied any animosity toward Mr. Muncey\u0097recalled that Mrs. Muncey \"was constantly with black eyes and busted mouth.\" App. 235. In addition Hazel Miller, who is Kathy Parker's mother and a lifelong acquaintance of Mr. Muncey, testified at the habeas hearing that two or three months before the victim's death Mr. Muncey came to Miller's home and \"tried to get my daughter [Parker] to go out with him,\" R274:47. (Parker had dated Mr. Muncey at age 14.) According to Miller, Muncey said \"[h]e was upset with his wife, that they had had an argument <span class=\"star-pagination\">*549</span> and he said he was going to get rid of that woman one way or the other.\" App. 236.</p>\n<p>Another witness\u0097Mary Atkins, also an area native who \"grew up\" with Mr. Muncey and professed no hard feelings, R274:10, 16\u0097claims she saw Mr. Muncey \"backhan[d]\" Mrs. Muncey on the very night of the murder. App. 226, 228. Atkins recalled that during a break in the recreation center dance, she saw Mr. Muncey and his wife arguing in the parking lot. Mr. Muncey \"grabbed her and he just backhanded her.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 228. After that, Mrs. Muncey \"left walking.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 229. There was also testimony from Atkins' mother, named Artie Lawson. A self-described \"good friend\" of Mr. Muncey, <i>id.,</i> at 231, Lawson said Mr. Muncey visited her the morning after the murder, before the body was found. According to Lawson, Mr. Muncey asked her to tell anyone who inquired not only that she had been at the dance the evening before and had seen him, but also that he had breakfasted at her home at 6 o'clock that morning. Lawson had not in fact been at the dance, nor had Mr. Muncey been with her so early.</p>\n<p>Of most importance is the testimony of Kathy Parker and her sister Penny Letner. They testified at the habeas hearing that, around the time of House's trial, Mr. Muncey had confessed to the crime. Parker recalled that she and \"some family members and some friends [were] sitting around drinking\" at Parker's trailer when Mr. Muncey \"just walked in and sit down.\" R274:37. Muncey, who had evidently been drinking heavily, began \"rambling off ... [t]alking about what happened to his wife and how it happened and he didn't mean to do it.\" <i>Ibid.</i> According to Parker, Mr. Muncey \"said they had been into [an] argument and he slapped her and she fell and hit her head and it killed her and he didn't mean for it to happen.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 38. Parker said she \"freaked out and run him off.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Letner similarly recalled that at some point either \"during [House's] trial or just before,\" <i>id.,</i> at 30, Mr. Muncey intruded <span class=\"star-pagination\">*550</span> on a gathering at Parker's home. Appearing \"pretty well blistered,\" Muncey \"went to crying and was talking about his wife and her death and he was saying that he didn't mean to do it.\" App. 232. \"[D]idn't mean to do what[?],\" Letner asked, R274:33, at which point Mr. Muncey explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[S]he was `bitching him out' because he didn't take her fishing that night, that he went to the dance instead. He said when he come home that she was still on him pretty heavily `bitching him out' again and that he smacked her and that she fell and hit her head. He said I didn't mean to do it, but I had to get rid of her, because I didn't want to be charged with murder.\" App. 232-233.</blockquote>\n<p>Letner, who was then 19 years old with a small child, said Mr. Muncey's statement \"scared [her] quite badly,\" so she \"got out of there immediately.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 233. Asked whether she reported the incident to the authorities, Letner stated, \"I was frightened, you know.... I figured me being 19 year old they wouldn't listen to anything I had to say.\" R274:31. Parker, on the other hand, claimed she (Parker) in fact went to the Sheriff's Department, but no one would listen:</p>\n<blockquote>\"I tried to speak to the Sheriff but he was real busy. He sent me to a deputy. The deputy told me to go upstairs to the courtroom and talk to this guy, I can't remember his name. I never did really get to talk to anybody.\" App. 234.</blockquote>\n<p>Parker said she did not discuss the matter further because \"[t]hey had it all signed, sealed and delivered. We didn't know anything to do until we heard that they reopened [House's] trial.\" R274:45. Parker's mother, Hazel Miller, confirmed she had driven Parker to the courthouse, where Parker \"went to talk to some of the people about this case.\" App. 237.</p>\n<p>Other testimony suggests Mr. Muncey had the opportunity to commit the crime. According to Dennis Wallace, a local <span class=\"star-pagination\">*551</span> law enforcement official who provided security at the dance on the night of the murder, Mr. Muncey left the dance \"around 10:00, 10:30, 9:30 to 10:30.\" R274:56-57. Although Mr. Muncey told law enforcement officials just after the murder that he left the dance only briefly and returned, Wallace could not recall seeing him back there again. Later that evening, Wallace responded to Mr. Muncey's report that his wife was missing. Muncey denied he and his wife had been \"a fussing or a fighting\"; he claimed his wife had been \"kidnapped.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 58. Wallace did not recall seeing any blood, disarray, or knocked-over furniture, although he admitted he \"didn't pay too much attention\" to whether the floor appeared especially clean. According to Wallace, Mr. Muncey said \"let's search for her\" and then led Wallace out to search \"in the weeds\" around the home and the driveway (not out on the road where the body was found). <i>Id.,</i> at 58, 60, 63.</p>\n<p>In the habeas proceedings, then, two different witnesses (Parker and Letner) described a confession by Mr. Muncey; two more (Atkins and Lawson) described suspicious behavior (a fight and an attempt to construct a false alibi) around the time of the crime; and still other witnesses described a history of abuse.</p>\n<p>As to Parker and Letner, the District Court noted that it was \"not impressed with the allegations of individuals who wait over ten years to come forward with their evidence,\" especially considering that \"there was no physical evidence in the Munceys' kitchen to corroborate [Mr. Muncey's] alleged confession that he killed [his wife] there.\" App. 348. Parker and Letner, however, did attempt to explain their delay coming forward, and the record indicates no reason why these two women, both lifelong acquaintances of Mr. Muncey, would have wanted either to frame him or to help House. Furthermore, the record includes at least some independent support for the statements Parker and Letner attributed to Mr. Muncey. The supposed explanation for the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*552</span> fatal fight\u0097that his wife was complaining about going fishing\u0097fits with Mrs. Muncey's statement to Luttrell earlier that evening that her husband's absence was \"all right, because she was going to make him take her fishing the next day,\" <i>id.,</i> at 11-12. And Dr. Blake testified, in only partial contradiction of Dr. Carabia, that Mrs. Muncey's head injury resulted from \"a surface with an edge\" or \"a hard surface with a corner,\" not from a fist. R275:72. (Dr. Carabia had said either a fist or some other object could have been the cause.)</p>\n<p>Mr. Muncey testified at the habeas hearing, and the District Court did not question his credibility. Though Mr. Muncey said he seemed to remember visiting Lawson the day after the murder, he denied either killing his wife or confessing to doing so. Yet Mr. Muncey also claimed, contrary to Constable Wallace's testimony and to his own prior statement, that he left the dance on the night of the crime only when it ended at midnight. Mr. Muncey, moreover, denied ever hitting Mrs. Muncey; the State itself had to impeach him with a prior statement on this point.</p>\n<p>It bears emphasis, finally, that Parker's and Letner's testimony is not comparable to the sort of eleventh-hour affidavit vouching for a defendant and incriminating a conveniently absent suspect that Justice O'Connor described in her concurring opinion in <i>Herrera</i> as \"unfortunate\" and \"not uncommon\" in capital cases, 506 U. S., at 423; nor was the confession Parker and Letner described induced under pressure of interrogation. The confession evidence here involves an alleged spontaneous statement recounted by two eyewitnesses with no evident motive to lie. For this reason it has more probative value than, for example, incriminating testimony from inmates, suspects, or friends or relations of the accused.</p>\n<p>The evidence pointing to Mr. Muncey is by no means conclusive. If considered in isolation, a reasonable jury might well disregard it. In combination, however, with the challenges <span class=\"star-pagination\">*553</span> to the blood evidence and the lack of motive with respect to House, the evidence pointing to Mr. Muncey likely would reinforce other doubts as to House's guilt.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Other Evidence</i></h2>\n<p>Certain other details were presented at the habeas hearing. First, Dr. Blake, in addition to testifying about the blood evidence and the victim's head injury, examined photographs of House's bruises and scratches and concluded, based on 35 years' experience monitoring the development and healing of bruises, that they were too old to have resulted from the crime. In addition Dr. Blake claimed that the injury on House's right knuckle was indicative of \"[g]etting mashed\"; it was not consistent with striking someone. R275:63. (That of course would also eliminate the explanation that the injury came from the blow House supposedly told Turner he gave to his unidentified assailant.)</p>\n<p>The victim's daughter, Lora Muncey (now Lora Tharp), also testified at the habeas hearing. She repeated her recollection of hearing a man with a deep voice like her grandfather's and a statement that her father had had a wreck down by the creek. She also denied seeing any signs of struggle or hearing a fight between her parents, though she also said she could not recall her parents ever fighting physically. The District Court found her credible, and this testimony certainly cuts in favor of the State.</p>\n<p>Finally, House himself testified at the habeas proceedings. He essentially repeated the story he allegedly told Turner about getting attacked on the road. The District Court found, however, based on House's demeanor, that he \"was not a credible witness.\" App. 329.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Conclusion</i></h2>\n<p>This is not a case of conclusive exoneration. Some aspects of the State's evidence\u0097Lora Muncey's memory of a deep voice, House's bizarre evening walk, his lie to law enforcement, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*554</span> his appearance near the body, and the blood on his pants\u0097still support an inference of guilt. Yet the central forensic proof connecting House to the crime\u0097the blood and the semen\u0097has been called into question, and House has put forward substantial evidence pointing to a different suspect. Accordingly, and although the issue is close, we conclude that this is the rare case where\u0097had the jury heard all the conflicting testimony\u0097it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror viewing the record as a whole would lack reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>In addition to his gateway claim under <i>Schlup,</i> House argues that he has shown freestanding innocence and that as a result his imprisonment and planned execution are unconstitutional. In <i>Herrera,</i> decided three years before <i>Schlup,</i> the Court assumed without deciding that \"in a capital case a truly persuasive demonstration of `actual innocence' made after trial would render the execution of a defendant unconstitutional, and warrant federal habeas relief if there were no state avenue open to process such a claim.\" 506 U. S., at 417; see also <i>id.,</i> at 419 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (\"I cannot disagree with the fundamental legal principle that executing the innocent is inconsistent with the Constitution\"). \"[T]he threshold showing for such an assumed right would necessarily be extraordinarily high,\" the Court explained, and petitioner's evidence there fell \"far short of that which would have to be made in order to trigger the sort of constitutional claim which we have assumed, <i>arguendo,</i> to exist.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 417, 418-419; see also <i>id.,</i> at 427 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (noting that because \"[p]etitioner has failed to make a persuasive showing of actual innocence,\" \"the Court has no reason to pass on, and appropriately reserves, the question whether federal courts may entertain convincing claims of actual innocence\"). House urges the Court to answer the question left open in <i>Herrera</i> and hold not only that free-standing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*555</span> innocence claims are possible but also that he has established one.</p>\n<p>We decline to resolve this issue. We conclude here, much as in <i>Herrera,</i> that whatever burden a hypothetical freestanding innocence claim would require, this petitioner has not satisfied it. To be sure, House has cast considerable doubt on his guilt\u0097doubt sufficient to satisfy <i>Schlup</i>'s gateway standard for obtaining federal review despite a state procedural default. In <i>Herrera,</i> however, the Court described the threshold for any hypothetical freestanding innocence claim as \"extraordinarily high.\" 506 U. S., at 417. The sequence of the Court's decisions in <i>Herrera</i> and <i>Schlup</i>\u0097first leaving unresolved the status of freestanding claims and then establishing the gateway standard\u0097implies at the least that <i>Herrera</i> requires more convincing proof of innocence than <i>Schlup.</i> It follows, given the closeness of the <i>Schlup</i> question here, that House's showing falls short of the threshold implied in <i>Herrera.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>House has satisfied the gateway standard set forth in <i>Schlup</i> and may proceed on remand with procedurally defaulted constitutional claims. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p>CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom Justice SCALIA and JUSTICE THOMAS join, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>To overcome the procedural hurdle that Paul House created by failing to properly present his constitutional claims to a Tennessee court, he must demonstrate that the constitutional violations he alleges \"ha[ve] probably resulted in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*556</span> conviction of one who is actually innocent,\" such that a federal court's refusal to hear the defaulted claims would be a \"miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Schlup</i> v. <i>Delo,</i> 513 U. S. 298, 326, 327 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). To make the requisite showing of actual innocence, House must produce \"new <i>reliable</i> evidence\" and \"must show that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in the light of the new evidence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 324, 327 (emphasis added). The question is not whether House was prejudiced at his trial because the jurors were not aware of the new evidence, but whether all the evidence, considered together, proves that House was actually innocent, so that no reasonable juror would vote to convict him. Considering all the evidence, and giving due regard to the District Court's findings on whether House's new evidence was reliable, I do not find it probable that no reasonable juror would vote to convict him, and accordingly I dissent.</p>\n<p>Because I do not think that House has satisfied the actual innocence standard set forth in <i>Schlup,</i> I do not believe that he has met the higher threshold for a freestanding innocence claim, assuming such a claim exists. See <i>Herrera</i> v. <i>Collins,</i> 506 U. S. 390, 417 (1993). I therefore concur in the judgment with respect to the Court's disposition of that separate claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In <i>Schlup,</i> we stated that a habeas petitioner attempting to present a defaulted claim to a federal court must present \"new <i>reliable</i> evidence\u0097whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence\u0097that was not presented at trial.\" 513 U. S., at 324 (emphasis added). Implicit in the requirement that a habeas petitioner present reliable evidence is the expectation that a factfinder will assess reliability. The new evidence at issue in <i>Schlup</i> had not been subjected to such an assessment\u0097the claim in <i>Schlup</i> was for an evidentiary hearing\u0097 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*557</span> and this Court specifically recognized that the \"new statements may, of course, be unreliable.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 331. The Court stated that the District Court, as the \"reviewing tribunal,\" was tasked with assessing the \"probative force\" of the petitioner's new evidence of innocence, and \"may have to make some credibility assessments.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 327-328, 330. Indeed, the Supreme Court took the unusual step of remanding the case to the Court of Appeals \"with instructions to remand to the District Court,\" so that the District Court could consider how the \"likely credibility of the affiants\" bears upon the \"probable reliability\" of the new evidence. <i>Id.,</i> at 332. In short, the new evidence is not simply taken at face value; its reliability has to be tested.</p>\n<p>Critical to the Court's conclusion here that House has sufficiently demonstrated his innocence are three pieces of new evidence presented to the District Court: DNA evidence showing that the semen on Carolyn Muncey's clothing was from her husband, Hubert Muncey, not from House; testimony from new witnesses implicating Mr. Muncey in the murder; and evidence indicating that Mrs. Muncey's blood spilled from test tubes containing autopsy samples in an evidence container. To determine whether it should open its door to House's defaulted constitutional claims, the District Court considered this evidence in a comprehensive evidentiary hearing. As House presented his new evidence, and as the State rebutted it, the District Court observed the witnesses' demeanor, examined physical evidence, and made findings about whether House's new evidence was in fact reliable. This factfinding role is familiar to a district court. \"The trial judge's major role is the determination of fact, and with experience in fulfilling that role comes expertise.\" <i>Anderson</i> v. <i>Bessemer City,</i> 470 U. S. 564, 574 (1985).</p>\n<p>The State did not contest House's new DNA evidence excluding him as the source of the semen on Mrs. Muncey's clothing, but it strongly contested the new testimony implicating <span class=\"star-pagination\">*558</span> Mr. Muncey, and it insisted that the blood spillage occurred <i>after</i> the FBI tested House's jeans and determined that they were stained with Mrs. Muncey's blood.</p>\n<p>At the evidentiary hearing, sisters Kathy Parker and Penny Letner testified that 14 years earlier, either during or around the time of House's trial, they heard Mr. Muncey drunkenly confess to having accidentally killed his wife when he struck her in their home during an argument, causing her to fall and hit her head. Record, Doc. 274, pp. 28-29, 30, 37-38. <i>Schlup</i> provided guidance on how a district court should assess this type of new evidence: The court \"may consider how the timing of the submission and the likely credibility of the affiants bear on the probable reliability of that evidence,\" and it \"must assess the probative force of the newly presented evidence in connection with the evidence of guilt adduced at trial.\" 513 U. S., at 332. Consistent with this guidance, the District Court concluded that the sisters' testimony was not credible. The court noted that it was \"not impressed with the allegations of individuals who wait over ten years to come forward.\" App. 348. It also considered how the new testimony fit within the larger web of evidence, observing that Mr. Muncey's alleged confession contradicted the testimony of the Munceys' \"very credible\" daughter, Lora Tharp, who consistently testified that she did not hear a fight in the house that night, but instead heard a man with a deep voice who lured her mother from the house by saying that Mr. Muncey had been in a wreck near the creek. <i>Id.,</i> at 323, 348.</p>\n<p>The District Court engaged in a similar reliability inquiry with regard to House's new evidence of blood spillage. At the evidentiary hearing, House conceded that FBI testing showed that his jeans were stained with Mrs. Muncey's blood, but he set out to prove that the blood spilled from test tubes containing autopsy samples, and that it did so before the jeans were tested by the FBI. The District Court summarized the testimony of the various witnesses who handled <span class=\"star-pagination\">*559</span> the evidence and their recollections about bloodstains and spillage; it acknowledged that House's expert, Dr. Cleland Blake, disagreed with FBI Agent Paul Bigbee about how to interpret the results of Agent Bigbee's genetic marker analysis summary; and it summarized the testimony of the State's blood spatter expert, Paulette Sutton. <i>Id.,</i> at 339-347. After reviewing all the evidence, the District Court stated: \"Based upon the evidence introduced during the evidentiary hearing . . . the court concludes that the spillage occurred <i>after</i> the FBI crime laboratory received and tested the evidence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 348 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Normally, an appellate court reviews a district court's factual findings only for clear error. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a) (\"Findings of fact, whether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses\"); <i>Bessemer City, supra,</i> at 574 (clearly-erroneous standard applies \"even when the district court's findings do not rest on credibility determinations, but are based instead on physical or documentary evidence or inferences from other facts\"). The Sixth Circuit deferred to the District Court's factual findings, 386 F. 3d 668, 684 (2004), and <i>Schlup</i> did not purport to alter\u0097but instead reaffirmed and highlighted\u0097the district court's critical role as factfinder. Yet the majority asserts that the clear error standard \"overstates the effect of the District Court's ruling,\" and then dismisses the District Court's reliability findings because it is \"uncertain about\" them, while stopping short of identifying clear error. <i>Ante,</i> at 539-540. This is a sharp departure from the guidance in <i>Schlup.</i></p>\n<p>In <i>Schlup,</i> we contrasted a district court's role in assessing the reliability of new evidence of innocence with a district court's role in deciding a summary judgment motion. 513 U. S., at 332. We explained that, in the latter situation, the district court does not assess credibility or weigh the evidence, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*560</span> but simply determines whether there is a genuine factual issue for trial. <i>Ibid.</i> Assessing the reliability of new evidence, on the other hand, is a typical factfinding role, requiring credibility determinations and a weighing of the \"probative force\" of the new evidence in light of \"the evidence of guilt adduced at trial.\" <i>Ibid.</i> We found it \"[o]bviou[s]\" that a habeas court conducting an actual innocence inquiry must do more than simply check whether there are genuine factual issues for trial. <i>Ibid.</i> The point of the actual innocence inquiry is for the federal habeas court to satisfy itself that it should suspend the normal procedural default rule, disregard the important judicial interests of finality and comity, and allow a state prisoner to present his defaulted constitutional claims to a federal court. See <i>McCleskey</i> v. <i>Zant,</i> 499 U. S. 467, 490-491 (1991).</p>\n<p>The majority surprisingly states that this guidance is inapplicable here because this case involves a \"fully developed record,\" while the District Court in <i>Schlup</i> had declined to conduct an evidentiary hearing. <i>Ante,</i> at 537-538. But the guidance is clearly applicable: The point in <i>Schlup</i> was not simply that a hearing was required, but why\u0097because the District Court had to assess the probative force of the petitioner's newly presented evidence, by engaging in factfinding rather than performing a summary-judgment-type inquiry. 513 U. S., at 331-332. That is precisely what the District Court did here. In addition to a \"fully developed record,\" we have the District Court's factual findings about the reliability of the new evidence in that record, factual findings which the majority disregards without finding clear error.</p>\n<p>The majority essentially disregards the District Court's role in assessing the reliability of House's new evidence. With regard to the sisters' testimony, the majority casts aside the District Court's determination that their statements came too late and were too inconsistent with credible record evidence to be reliable, instead observing that the women had no obvious reason to lie, that a few aspects of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*561</span> their testimony have record support, and that they recounted an uncoerced confession. <i>Ante,</i> at 551-552. As for the District Court's express finding that the autopsy blood spilled after the FBI tested House's jeans, the majority points to Dr. Blake's testimony that blood enzymes \"are generally better preserved on cloth,\" and even conjures up its own theory in an attempt to refute Ms. Sutton's expert testimony that the pattern of some bloodstains was consistent with blood being transferred while the pants were being worn. <i>Ante,</i> at 546-547 (\"This should be a matter for the trier of fact to consider in the first instance, but we can note a line of argument that could refute the State's position. . . . [Ms. Sutton's] testimony . . . does not refute the hypothesis that the packaging of the pants for transport was what caused them to be folded or creased\"); see App. 296.</p>\n<p>The majority's assessment of House's new evidence is precisely the summary-judgment-type inquiry <i>Schlup</i> said was inappropriate. 513 U. S., at 332. By casting aside the District Court's factual determinations made after a comprehensive evidentiary hearing, the majority has done little more than reiterate the factual disputes presented below. Witnesses do not testify in our courtroom, and it is not our role to make credibility findings and construct theories of the possible ways in which Mrs. Muncey's blood could have been spattered and wiped on House's jeans. The District Court did not painstakingly conduct an evidentiary hearing to compile a record for us to sort through transcript by transcript and photograph by photograph, assessing for ourselves the reliability of what we see. <i>Schlup</i> made abundantly clear that reliability determinations were essential, but were for the district court to make. <i>Id.,</i> at 331-332. We are to defer to the better situated District Court on reliability, unless we determine that its findings are clearly erroneous. We are not concerned with \"the district court's independent judgment as to whether reasonable doubt exists,\" <i>id.,</i> at 329, but the District Court here made basic factual findings about <span class=\"star-pagination\">*562</span> the reliability of House's new evidence; it did not offer its personal opinion about whether it doubted House's guilt. <i>Schlup</i> makes clear that those findings are controlling unless clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p>I have found no clear error in the District Court's reliability findings. Not having observed Ms. Parker and Ms. Letner testify, I would defer to the District Court's determination that they are not credible, and the evidence in the record undermining the tale of an accidental killing during a fight in the Muncey home convinces me that this credibility finding is not clearly erroneous. Dr. Alex Carabia, who performed the autopsy, testified to injuries far more severe than a bump on the head: Mrs. Muncey had bruises on the front and back of her neck, on both thighs, on her lower right leg and left knee, and her hands were bloodstained up to the wrists; her injuries were consistent with a struggle and traumatic strangulation. Record, Addendum 4, 7 Tr. of Evidence in No. 378 (Crim. Ct. Union County, Tenn.), pp. 984-987 (hereinafter Tr.). And, of course, Lora Tharp has consistently recalled a deep-voiced visitor arriving late at night to tell Mrs. Muncey that her husband was in a wreck near the creek. App. 19, 270.</p>\n<p>I also find abundant evidence in the record to support the District Court's finding that blood spilled within the evidence container after the FBI received and tested House's jeans. Agent Bigbee testified that there was no leakage in the items submitted to him for testing. <i>Id.,</i> at 277. The majority's entire analysis on this point assumes the agent flatly lied, though there was no attack on his credibility below. Moreover, Ms. Sutton determined, in her expert opinion, that the wide distribution of stains \"front and back, top to bottom,\" the fact that some bloodstains were mixed with mud, and the presence of bloodstains inside the pocket and inside the fly, showed that the blood was spattered and wiped\u0097not spilled\u0097on House's jeans. <i>Id.,</i> at 291-293, 295; <i>id.,</i> at 293 (\"[I]f a tube of blood had spilled on these pants, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*563</span> the stain should have been in a localized area\"); <i>id.,</i> at 294 (\"The stains also . . . either originate on the inside and don't soak out or on the outside and are not soaking to the inside. That, of course, would be what you would see with a spill\").</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting that the blood evidently spilled inside the evidence container when the jeans were protected inside a plastic zip lock bag, as shown by the presence of a bloodstain on the outside of that bag. See Record, Pl. Exh. 10-6. House's expert tested the exterior and interior of that plastic bag for bloodstains using an \"extremely sensitive\" test, and only the exterior of the bag tested positive for blood. <i>Id.,</i> Doc. 274, at 95-96. The evidence in the record indicates that the jeans were placed in the plastic bag <i>after</i> they arrived at the FBI: FBI records show that the jeans arrived there in a <i>paper</i> bag, and the plastic bag has FBI markings on it. <i>Id.,</i> Addendum 2, Trial Exh. 31, at 36; <i>id.,</i> Pl. Exh. 10-6. The bloodstain on the outside of the <i>plastic</i> bag therefore further supports the District Court's conclusion that the blood spilled <i>after</i> the evidence was received and tested by the FBI, and not en route when the jeans were in a paper bag. I suppose it is theoretically possible that the jeans were contaminated by spillage before arriving at the FBI, that Agent Bigbee either failed to note or lied about such spillage, and that the FBI then transferred the jeans into a plastic bag and put them back inside the evidence container with the spilled blood still sloshing around sufficiently to contaminate the outside of the plastic bag as extensively as it did. This sort of unbridled speculation can theoretically defeat any inconvenient fact, but does not suffice to convince me that the District Court's factual finding\u0097that the blood spilled <i>after</i> FBI testing\u0097was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the yellow \"Tennessee Crime Lab\" tape placed around the container on all four sides does not line up when the bloodstained corners of the container and its lid are aligned, showing that the blood did not spill until sometime after the container was received and opened at its first destination\u0097 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*564</span> the FBI. See <i>id.,</i> Respondent's Exh. 24; <i>id.,</i> Doc. 276, at 190-191 (testimony of Paulette Sutton). The majority points out that on one side of the container, the first of two layers of tape appears to begin cleanly at the lid's edge, and from this concludes that the container must have been cut open and resealed by Tennessee authorities en route to the FBI. <i>Ante,</i> at 545; see Record, Respondent's Exh. 23d. Even if the majority's deduction from a photograph of the container were true, it would show only that Tennessee authorities had reason to open the container once it was sealed to take something out or put something in, perhaps back at the crime lab in Union County. But even if the container had been opened before its arrival at the FBI, the majority recognizes that it was resealed with \"Tennessee Crime Lab\" tape, and the second layer of tape aligns only when the bloodstains on the container and its lid do not. <i>Ante,</i> at 544. Of course, the District Court\u0097which concluded that the blood was spilled <i>after</i> testing at the FBI laboratory\u0097had before it the box itself with the tape as the witnesses testified on the point, and not\u0097like this Court\u0097simply a photograph. See <i>Bessemer City,</i> 470 U. S., at 574 (district court's findings about physical evidence are reviewed for clear error).</p>\n<p>House's theory that the blood on his jeans was transferred there from the autopsy samples is based on Dr. Blake's reading of Agent Bigbee's enzyme marker analysis summary. After reading the summary, Dr. Blake concluded that the enzymes in the bloodstains on House's jeans and the enzymes in the autopsy samples had deteriorated to the same extent. Record, Doc. 275, at 110. In particular, he noted that the GLO1 enzyme showed \"incomplete penetration\" on both the autopsy blood and the jeans, and because enzymes are better preserved on cloth, the enzyme should have been present on the jeans. <i>Id.,</i> at 116. But Agent Bigbee disputed Dr. Blake's reading of what was, after all, Agent Bigbee's own study. He testified that \"`inc'\" on his chart meant \"inconclusive,\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*565</span> not \"incomplete penetration,\" and that the term \"inconclusive\" meant that the enzyme was present, but could not be grouped into an ABO bloodtype. <i>Id.,</i> Doc. 276, at 140. While pointing out that his summary showed different levels of enzymes in the two samples, Agent Bigbee also noted that many different factors\u0097such as heat, dirt, or bacteria in a clothes hamper\u0097could cause enzymes to degrade on cloth. <i>Id.,</i> at 139, 167-170. Considering how House's new blood spillage evidence fits within the record as a whole, I can see no clear error in the District Court's express finding that the blood spilled in the evidence container <i>after</i> the FBI found Mrs. Muncey's blood on House's jeans.</p>\n<p>The District Court attentively presided over a complex evidentiary hearing, often questioning witnesses extensively during the presentation of critical evidence. See, <i>e. g., id.,</i> Doc. 275, at 110-115. The court concisely summarized the evidence presented, then dutifully made findings about the reliability of the testimony it heard and the evidence it observed. We are poorly equipped to second-guess the District Court's reliability findings and should defer to them, consistent with the guidance we provided in <i>Schlup.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>With due regard to the District Court's reliability findings, this case invites a straightforward application of the legal standard adopted in <i>Schlup.</i> A petitioner does not pass through the <i>Schlup</i> gateway if it is \"more likely than not that there is <i>any</i> juror who, acting reasonably, would have found the petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 513 U. S., at 333 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The majority states that if House had presented just one of his three key pieces of evidence\u0097or even two of the three\u0097he would not pass through the <i>Schlup</i> gateway. See <i>ante,</i> at 548 (\"Were House's challenge to the State's case limited to the questions he has raised about the blood and semen, the other evidence favoring the prosecution might <span class=\"star-pagination\">*566</span> well suffice to bar relief\"); <i>ante,</i> at 552-553 (\"If considered in isolation, a reasonable jury might well disregard [the evidence pointing to Mr. Muncey]. In combination, however, with the challenges to the blood evidence and the lack of motive with respect to House, the evidence pointing to Mr. Muncey likely would reinforce other doubts as to House's guilt\"). According to the majority, House has picked the trifecta of evidence that places conviction outside the realm of choices <i>any</i> juror, acting reasonably, would make. Because the case against House remains substantially unaltered from the case presented to the jury, I disagree.</p>\n<p>At trial, the State presented its story about what happened on the night of Mrs. Muncey's murder. The Munceys' daughter heard a deep-voiced perpetrator arrive at the Muncey home late at night and tell Mrs. Muncey that her husband had been in a wreck near the creek. App. 19. Ms. Tharp relayed her testimony again at the evidentiary hearing, and the District Court determined that she was a \"very credible witness.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 270, 323.</p>\n<p>When police questioned House after witnesses reported seeing him emerge from the embankment near Mrs. Muncey's body shortly before it was discovered, he told two different officers that he never left Donna Turner's trailer the previous evening, even recounting the series of television programs he watched before going to bed. 7 Tr. 963-965, 1031-1032. He had worked to concoct an alibi we now know was a lie. On the day Mrs. Muncey's body was found, Bill Breeding, a criminal investigator at the Union County Sheriff's Office, observed House at the local jail and noticed that he had abrasions \"across his knuckles and about his hands,\" two or three bruises on his right arm, scratches on his chest, and his right ring finger was red and swollen. 6 <i>id.,</i> at 801-802. The interviewing officers noticed similar injuries. App. 78-80; 7 Tr. 974-975. House told them that his finger was swollen because he fell off a porch, and the scratches and bruises were from tearing down a building, and from a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*567</span> cat. <i>Ibid.</i> Ms. Turner initially confirmed House's alibi, but she changed her story when police warned her that covering up a homicide was a serious offense. <i>Id.,</i> at 1063. Ms. Turner then told police that House had in fact left her house that night between 10:30 and 10:45 p.m. <i>Id.,</i> at 1062-1063. He came back some time later panting and sweating, shirtless and shoeless, and with various injuries. App. 88-91; 8 Tr. 1154-1155.</p>\n<p>Also on the day the body was found, Sheriff Earl Loy asked House if he was wearing the same clothes he wore the night before. 6 <i>id.,</i> at 845. House \"hesitated,\" then stated that he had changed his shirt, <i>but not his jeans. Ibid.</i> In other words, he specifically tried to conceal from the police that he had worn other jeans the night before, for reasons that were to become clear. Ms. Turner revealed that House's statement that he had not changed his jeans was a lie, and police retrieved House's dirty jeans from Ms. Turner's hamper. <i>Ibid.</i> Of course, FBI testing revealed that House's jeans were stained with Mrs. Muncey's blood, and the District Court determined that House's new evidence of blood spillage did not undermine those test results. App. 348. If in fact Mrs. Muncey's blood only got on House's jeans from later evidentiary spillage, House would have had no reason to lie to try to keep the existence of the concealed jeans from the police.</p>\n<p>Through Ms. Turner's testimony at trial, the jury also heard House's story about what happened that night. He left Ms. Turner's trailer late at night to go for a walk. <i>Id.,</i> at 86. When he returned some time later\u0097panting, sweating, and missing his shirt and shoes\u0097he told her that some men in a truck tried to kill him. <i>Id.,</i> at 88-91. When Ms. Turner asked House about his injuries, he attributed them to fighting with his assailants. <i>Id.,</i> at 90; 8 Tr. 1154-1155. House retold this story to the District Court, saying that he initially lied to police because he was on parole and did not want to draw attention to himself. Record, Doc. 276, at 99, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*568</span> 108-109. In other words, having nothing to hide and facing a murder charge, House lied\u0097and when he was caught in the lie, he said he lied not to escape the murder charge, but solely to avoid unexplained difficulties with his parole officer. The jury rejected House's story about the night's events, and the District Court \"considered Mr. House's demeanor and found that he was not a credible witness.\" App. 329.</p>\n<p>The jury also heard House's attempt to implicate Mr. Muncey in his wife's murder by calling Mrs. Muncey's brother, Ricky Green, as a witness. Mr. Green testified that two weeks before the murder, his sister called him to say that she and Mr. Muncey had been fighting, that she wanted to leave him, and that she was scared. 7 Tr. 1088. Mr. Green also testified that the Munceys had marital problems, and that he had previously seen Mr. Muncey hit his wife. <i>Id.,</i> at 1087. The jury rejected House's attempt to implicate Mr. Muncey, and the District Court was not persuaded by House's attempt to supplement this evidence at the evidentiary hearing, finding that his new witnesses were not credible. App. 348.</p>\n<p>Noticeably absent from the State's story about what happened to Mrs. Muncey on the night of her death was much mention of the semen found on Mrs. Muncey's clothing. House's single victory at the evidentiary hearing was new DNA evidence proving that the semen was deposited by Mr. Muncey. The majority identifies the semen evidence as \"[c]entral to the State's case\" against House, <i>ante,</i> at 528, but House's jury would probably be quite surprised by this characterization. At trial, Agent Bigbee testified that from the semen stains on Mrs. Muncey's clothing, he could determine that the man who deposited the semen had type A blood, and was a secretor. App. 54-56. Agent Bigbee also testified that House and Mr. Muncey both have type A blood, that House is a secretor, and that \"[t]here is an <i>eighty (80%) percent</i> chance that [Mr. Muncey] is a secretor.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 55-56; 6 Tr. 952 (emphasis added). Moreover, Agent Bigbee <span class=\"star-pagination\">*569</span> informed the jury that because 40 percent of people have type A blood, and 80 percent of those people are secretors, the semen on Mrs. Muncey's clothing could have been deposited by roughly one out of every three males. <i>Id.,</i> at 957. The jury was also informed several times by the defense that Mrs. Muncey's body was found fully clothed. See, <i>e. g.,</i> 4 <i>id.,</i> at 628; 9 <i>id.,</i> at 1274.</p>\n<p>The majority describes House's sexual motive as \"a central theme in the State's narrative linking House to the crime,\" and states that without the semen evidence, \"a jury . . . would have found it necessary to establish some different motive, or, if the same motive, an intent far more speculative.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 541. The State, however, consistently directed the jury's attention <i>away</i> from motive, and sexual motive was far from a \"central theme\" of the State's case\u0097 presumably because of the highly ambiguous nature of the semen evidence recounted above. The Tennessee Supreme Court did not mention that evidence in cataloging the \"[p]articularly incriminating\" or \"[d]amaging\" evidence against House. App. 135. The State did not mention the semen evidence in its opening statement to the jury, instead focusing on premeditation. 4 Tr. 613-615. The defense used its opening statement to expose lack of motive as a weakness in the State's case. <i>Id.,</i> at 628. After the State's equivocal presentation of the semen evidence through Agent Bigbee's testimony at trial, the State again made no reference to the semen evidence or to a motive in its closing argument, prompting the defense to again highlight this omission. 9 <i>id.,</i> at 1274 (\"[W]hy was Carolyn Muncey killed? We don't know. Is it important to have some motive? In your minds? What motive did Paul Gregory House have to go over and kill a woman that he barely knew? Who was still dressed, still clad in her clothes\").</p>\n<p>In rebuttal, the State disclaimed any responsibility to prove motive, again shifting the jury's focus to premeditation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*570</span> \"The law says that if you take another person's life, you beat them, you strangle them, and then you don't succeed, and then you kill them by giving them multiple blows to the head, and one massive blow to the head, and that that causes their brains to crash against the other side of their skull, and caused such severe bleeding inside the skull itself, that you die\u0097that it does not make any difference under God's heaven, what the motive was. That is what the law is. The law is that if motive is shown, it can be considered by the jury as evidence of guilt. But the law is that if you prove that a killing was done, beyond a reasonable doubt, by a person, and that he premeditated it, he planned it, it is not necessary for the jury to conclude why he did it.\" App. 106.</blockquote>\n<p>As a followup to this explanation, when the trial was almost over and only in response to the defense's consistent prodding, the State made its first and only reference to a possible motive, followed immediately by another disclaimer:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Now, you may have an idea why he did it. The evidence at the scene which seemed to suggest that he was subjecting this lady to some kind of indignity, why would you get a lady out of her house, late at night, in her night clothes, under the trick that her husband has had a wreck down by the creek? . . . Why is it that you choke her? Why is it that you repeatedly beat her? Why is it that she has scrapes all over her body? Well, it is because either you don't want her to tell what indignities you have subjected her to, or she is unwilling and fights against you, against being subjected to those indignities. . . . That is what the evidence at the scene suggests about motive. But motive is not an element of the crime. It is something that you can consider, or ignore. Whatever you prefer. The issue is not motive. The issue is premeditation.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 106-107.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*571</span> It is on this \"obliqu[e]\" reference to the semen evidence during the State's closing argument that the majority bases its assertion that House's sexual motive was a \"central theme in the State's narrative.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 531, 541. Although it is possible that one or even some jurors might have entertained doubt about House's guilt absent the clearest evidence of motive, I do not find it more likely than not that <i>every</i> juror would have done so, and that is the legal standard under <i>Schlup.</i> The majority aphoristically states that \"[w]hen identity is in question, motive is key.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 540. Not at all. Sometimes, when identity is in question, alibi is key. Here, House came up with one\u0097and it fell apart, later admitted to be fabricated when his girlfriend would not lie to protect him. Scratches from a cat, indeed. Surely a reasonable juror would give the fact that an alibi had been made up and discredited significant weight. People facing a murder charge, who are innocent, do not make up a story out of concern that the truth might somehow disturb their parole officer. And people do not lie to the police about which jeans they were wearing the night of a murder, if they have no reason to believe the jeans would be stained with the blood shed by the victim in her last desperate struggle to live.</p>\n<p>In <i>Schlup,</i> we made clear that the standard we adopted requires a \"stronger showing than that needed to establish prejudice.\" 513 U. S., at 327. In other words, House must show more than just a \"reasonable probability that . . . the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.\" <i>Strickland</i> v. <i>Washington,</i> 466 U. S. 668, 695 (1984). House must present such compelling evidence of innocence that it becomes more likely than not that no single juror, acting reasonably, would vote to convict him. <i>Schlup, supra,</i> at 329. The majority's conclusion is that given the sisters' testimony (if believed), and Dr. Blake's rebutted testimony about how to interpret Agent Bigbee's enzyme marker analysis summary (if accepted), combined with the revelation that the semen on Mrs. Muncey's clothing was deposited <span class=\"star-pagination\">*572</span> by her husband (which the jurors knew was just as likely as the semen having been deposited by House), no reasonable juror would vote to convict House. <i>Ante,</i> at 553-554. Given the District Court's reliability findings about the first two pieces of evidence, the evidence before us now is not substantially different from that considered by House's jury. I therefore find it more likely than not that in light of this new evidence, at least one juror, acting reasonably, would vote to convict House. The evidence as a whole certainly does not establish that House is actually innocent of the crime of murdering Carolyn Muncey, and accordingly I dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for the American Bar Association by <i>Michael S.
