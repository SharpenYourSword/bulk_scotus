Frederick</i> argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs were <i>Richard L. Huffman, William M. Brodsky,</i> and <i>V. David Rivkin.</i></p>\n<p><i>Kevin P. Roddy</i> argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p>JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968 (2000 ed. and Supp. III), prohibits certain conduct involving a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\" \u00a7 1962 (2000 ed.). One of RICO's enforcement mechanisms is a private right of action, available to \"[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation\" of RICO's substantive restrictions. \u00a7 1964(c).</p>\n<p>In <i>Holmes</i> v. <i>Securities Investor Protection Corporation,</i> 503 U. S. 258, 268 (1992), this Court held that a plaintiff may sue under \u00a7 1964(c) only if the alleged RICO violation was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury. The instant case requires us to apply the principles discussed in <i>Holmes</i> to a dispute between two competing businesses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Because this case arises from a motion to dismiss, we accept as true the factual allegations in the amended complaint. See <i>Leatherman</i> v. <i>Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit,</i> 507 U. S. 163, 164 (1993).</p>\n<p>Respondent Ideal Steel Supply Corporation (Ideal) sells steel mill products along with related supplies and services. It operates two store locations in New York, one in Queens and the other in the Bronx. Petitioner National Steel Supply, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*454</span> Inc. (National), owned by petitioners Joseph and Vincent Anza, is Ideal's principal competitor. National offers a similar array of products and services, and it, too, operates one store in Queens and one in the Bronx.</p>\n<p>Ideal sued petitioners in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. It claimed petitioners were engaged in an unlawful racketeering scheme aimed at \"gain[ing] sales and market share at Ideal's expense.\" App. 7. According to Ideal, National adopted a practice of failing to charge the requisite New York sales tax to cashpaying customers, even when conducting transactions that were not exempt from sales tax under state law. This practice allowed National to reduce its prices without affecting its profit margin. Petitioners allegedly submitted fraudulent tax returns to the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance in an effort to conceal their conduct.</p>\n<p>Ideal's amended complaint contains, as relevant here, two RICO claims. The claims assert that petitioners, by submitting the fraudulent tax returns, committed various acts of mail fraud (when they sent the returns by mail) and wire fraud (when they sent them electronically). See 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341, 1343 (2000 ed., Supp. III). Mail fraud and wire fraud are forms of \"racketeering activity\" for purposes of RICO. \u00a7 1961(1)(B). Petitioners' conduct allegedly constituted a \"pattern of racketeering activity,\" see \u00a7 1961(5) (2000 ed.), because the fraudulent returns were submitted on an ongoing and regular basis.</p>\n<p>Ideal asserts in its first cause of action that Joseph and Vincent Anza violated \u00a7 1962(c), which makes it unlawful for \"any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.\" The complaint states that the Anzas' goal, which <span class=\"star-pagination\">*455</span> they achieved, was to give National a competitive advantage over Ideal.</p>\n<p>The second cause of action is asserted against all three petitioners. It alleges a violation of \u00a7 1962(a), which makes it unlawful for any person who has received income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity \"to use or invest\" that income \"in acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of,\" an enterprise engaged in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce. As described in the complaint, petitioners used funds generated by their fraudulent tax scheme to open National's Bronx location. The opening of this new facility caused Ideal to lose \"significant business and market share.\" App. 18.</p>\n<p>Petitioners moved to dismiss Ideal's complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 9(b). The District Court granted the Rule 12(b)(6) motion, holding that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court began from the proposition that to assert a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud or wire fraud, a plaintiff must have relied on the defendant's misrepresentations. Ideal not having alleged that it relied on petitioners' false tax returns, the court concluded Ideal could not go forward with its RICO claims.</p>\n<p>Ideal appealed, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the District Court's judgment. 373 F. 3d 251 (2004). Addressing Ideal's \u00a7 1962(c) claim, the court held that where a complaint alleges a pattern of racketeering activity \"that was intended to and did give the defendant a competitive advantage over the plaintiff, the complaint adequately pleads proximate cause, and the plaintiff has standing to pursue a civil RICO claim.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 263. This is the case, the court explained, \"even where the scheme depended on fraudulent communications directed to and relied on by a third party rather than the plaintiff.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The court reached the same conclusion with respect to Ideal's \u00a7 1962(a) claim. It reasoned that Ideal adequately <span class=\"star-pagination\">*456</span> pleaded its claim because it alleged an injury by reason of petitioners' use and investment of racketeering proceeds, \"as distinct from injury traceable simply to the predicate acts of racketeering alone or to the conduct of the business of the enterprise.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 264.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari. 546 U. S. 1029 (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Our analysis begins\u0097and, as will become evident, largely ends\u0097with <i>Holmes.</i> That case arose from a complaint filed by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), a private corporation with a duty to reimburse the customers of registered broker-dealers who became unable to meet their financial obligations. SIPC claimed that the petitioner, Robert Holmes, conspired with others to manipulate stock prices. When the market detected the fraud, the share prices plummeted, and the \"decline caused [two] broker-dealers' financial difficulties resulting in their eventual liquidation and SIPC's advance of nearly $13 million to cover their customers' claims.\" 503 U. S., at 262, 263. SIPC sued on several theories, including that Holmes participated in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity in violation of \u00a7 1962(c) and conspired to do so in violation of \u00a7 1962(d).</p>\n<p>The Court held that SIPC could not maintain its RICO claims against Holmes for his alleged role in the scheme. The decision relied on a careful interpretation of \u00a7 1964(c), which provides a civil cause of action to persons injured \"by reason of\" a defendant's RICO violation. The Court recognized the phrase \"by reason of\" could be read broadly to require merely that the claimed violation was a \"but for\" cause of the plaintiff's injury. <i>Id.,</i> at 265-266. It rejected this reading, however, noting the \"unlikelihood that Congress meant to allow all factually injured plaintiffs to recover.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 266.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*457</span> Proper interpretation of \u00a7 1964(c) required consideration of the statutory history, which revealed that \"Congress modeled \u00a7 1964(c) on the civil-action provision of the federal anti-trust laws, \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 267. In <i>Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc.</i> v. <i>Carpenters,</i> 459 U. S. 519 (1983), the Court held that \"a plaintiff's right to sue under \u00a7 4 required a showing that the defendant's violation not only was a `but for' cause of his injury, but was the proximate cause as well.\" <i>Holmes, supra,</i> at 268 (citing <i>Associated Gen. Contractors, supra,</i> at 534). This reasoning, the Court noted in <i>Holmes,</i> \"applies just as readily to \u00a7 1964(c).\" 503 U. S., at 268.</p>\n<p>The <i>Holmes</i> Court turned to the common-law foundations of the proximate-cause requirement, and specifically the \"demand for some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\" <i>Ibid.</i> It concluded that even if SIPC were subrogated to the rights of certain aggrieved customers, the RICO claims could not satisfy this requirement of directness. The deficiency, the Court explained, was that \"the link is too remote between the stock manipulation alleged and the customers' harm, being purely contingent on the harm suffered by the broker-dealers.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 271.</p>\n<p>Applying the principles of <i>Holmes</i> to the present case, we conclude Ideal cannot maintain its claim based on \u00a7 1962(c). Section 1962(c), as noted above, forbids conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. The Court has indicated the compensable injury flowing from a violation of that provision \"necessarily is the harm caused by predicate acts sufficiently related to constitute a pattern, for the essence of the violation is the commission of those acts in connection with the conduct of an enterprise.\" <i>Sedima, S. P. R. L.</i> v. <i>Imrex Co.,</i> 473 U. S. 479, 497 (1985).</p>\n<p>Ideal's theory is that Joseph and Vincent Anza harmed it by defrauding the New York tax authority and using the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*458</span> proceeds from the fraud to offer lower prices designed to attract more customers. The RICO violation alleged by Ideal is that the Anzas conducted National's affairs through a pattern of mail fraud and wire fraud. The direct victim of this conduct was the State of New York, not Ideal. It was the State that was being defrauded and the State that lost tax revenue as a result.</p>\n<p>The proper referent of the proximate-cause analysis is an alleged practice of conducting National's business through a pattern of defrauding the State. To be sure, Ideal asserts it suffered its own harms when the Anzas failed to charge customers for the applicable sales tax. The cause of Ideal's asserted harms, however, is a set of actions (offering lower prices) entirely distinct from the alleged RICO violation (defrauding the State). The attenuation between the plaintiff's harms and the claimed RICO violation arises from a different source in this case than in <i>Holmes,</i> where the alleged violations were linked to the asserted harms only through the broker-dealers' inability to meet their financial obligations. Nevertheless, the absence of proximate causation is equally clear in both cases.</p>\n<p>This conclusion is confirmed by considering the directness requirement's underlying premises. See 503 U. S., at 269-270. One motivating principle is the difficulty that can arise when a court attempts to ascertain the damages caused by some remote action. See <i>id.,</i> at 269 (\"[T]he less direct an injury is, the more difficult it becomes to ascertain the amount of a plaintiff's damages attributable to the violation, as distinct from other, independent, factors\"). The instant case is illustrative. The injury Ideal alleges is its own loss of sales resulting from National's decreased prices for cashpaying customers. National, however, could have lowered its prices for any number of reasons unconnected to the asserted pattern of fraud. It may have received a cash inflow from some other source or concluded that the additional sales would justify a smaller profit margin. Its lowering of prices <span class=\"star-pagination\">*459</span> in no sense required it to defraud the state tax authority. Likewise, the fact that a company commits tax fraud does not mean the company will lower its prices; the additional cash could go anywhere from asset acquisition to research and development to dividend payouts. Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 271 (\"The broker-dealers simply cannot pay their bills, and only that intervening insolvency connects the conspirators' acts to the losses suffered by the nonpurchasing customers and general creditors\").</p>\n<p>There is, in addition, a second discontinuity between the RICO violation and the asserted injury. Ideal's lost sales could have resulted from factors other than petitioners' alleged acts of fraud. Businesses lose and gain customers for many reasons, and it would require a complex assessment to establish what portion of Ideal's lost sales were the product of National's decreased prices. Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 272-273 (\"If the nonpurchasing customers were allowed to sue, the district court would first need to determine the extent to which their inability to collect from the broker-dealers was the result of the alleged conspiracy to manipulate, as opposed to, say, the broker-dealers' poor business practices or their failures to anticipate developments in the financial markets\").</p>\n<p>The attenuated connection between Ideal's injury and the Anzas' injurious conduct thus implicates fundamental concerns expressed in <i>Holmes.</i> Notwithstanding the lack of any appreciable risk of duplicative recoveries, which is another consideration relevant to the proximate-cause inquiry, see <i>id.,</i> at 269, these concerns help to illustrate why Ideal's alleged injury was not the direct result of a RICO violation. Further illustrating this point is the speculative nature of the proceedings that would follow if Ideal were permitted to maintain its claim. A court considering the claim would need to begin by calculating the portion of National's price drop attributable to the alleged pattern of racketeering activity. It next would have to calculate the portion of Ideal's lost sales attributable to the relevant part of the price drop. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*460</span> The element of proximate causation recognized in <i>Holmes</i> is meant to prevent these types of intricate, uncertain inquiries from overrunning RICO litigation. It has particular resonance when applied to claims brought by economic competitors, which, if left unchecked, could blur the line between RICO and the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p>The requirement of a direct causal connection is especially warranted where the immediate victims of an alleged RICO violation can be expected to vindicate the laws by pursuing their own claims. See <i>id.,</i> at 269-270 (\"[D]irectly injured victims can generally be counted on to vindicate the law as private attorneys general, without any of the problems attendant upon suits by plaintiffs injured more remotely\"). Again, the instant case is instructive. Ideal accuses the Anzas of defrauding the State of New York out of a substantial amount of money. If the allegations are true, the State can be expected to pursue appropriate remedies. The adjudication of the State's claims, moreover, would be relatively straightforward; while it may be difficult to determine facts such as the number of sales Ideal lost due to National's tax practices, it is considerably easier to make the initial calculation of how much tax revenue the Anzas withheld from the State. There is no need to broaden the universe of actionable harms to permit RICO suits by parties who have been injured only indirectly.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals reached a contrary conclusion, apparently reasoning that because the Anzas allegedly sought to gain a competitive advantage over Ideal, it is immaterial whether they took an indirect route to accomplish their goal. See 373 F. 3d, at 263. This rationale does not accord with <i>Holmes.</i> A RICO plaintiff cannot circumvent the proximate-cause requirement simply by claiming that the defendant's aim was to increase market share at a competitor's expense. See <i>Associated Gen. Contractors,</i> 459 U. S., at 537 (\"We are also satisfied that an allegation of improper motive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*461</span>. . . is not a panacea that will enable any complaint to withstand a motion to dismiss\"). When a court evaluates a RICO claim for proximate causation, the central question it must ask is whether the alleged violation led directly to the plaintiff's injuries. In the instant case, the answer is no. We hold that Ideal's \u00a7 1962(c) claim does not satisfy the requirement of proximate causation.</p>\n<p>Petitioners alternatively ask us to hold, in line with the District Court's decision granting petitioners' motion to dismiss, that a plaintiff may not assert a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud or wire fraud unless it demonstrates it relied on the defendant's misrepresentations. They argue that RICO's private right of action must be interpreted in light of common-law principles, and that at common law a fraud action requires the plaintiff to prove reliance. Because Ideal has not satisfied the proximate-cause requirement articulated in <i>Holmes,</i> we have no occasion to address the substantial question whether a showing of reliance is required. Cf. 503 U. S., at 275-276.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The amended complaint also asserts a RICO claim based on a violation of \u00a7 1962(a). The claim alleges petitioners' tax scheme provided them with funds to open a new store in the Bronx, which attracted customers who otherwise would have purchased from Ideal.</p>\n<p>In this Court petitioners contend that the proximate-cause analysis should function identically for purposes of Ideal's \u00a7 1962(c) claim and its \u00a7 1962(a) claim. (Petitioners also contend that \"a civil RICO plaintiff does not plead an injury proximately caused by a violation of \u00a7 1962(a) merely by alleging that a corporate defendant reinvested profits back into itself,\" Brief for Petitioners 20, n. 5, but this argument has not been developed, and we decline to address it.) It is true that private actions for violations of \u00a7 1962(a), like actions for violations of \u00a7 1962(c), must be asserted under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*462</span> \u00a7 1964(c). It likewise is true that a claim is cognizable under \u00a7 1964(c) only if the defendant's alleged violation proximately caused the plaintiff's injury. The proximate-cause inquiry, however, requires careful consideration of the \"relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\" <i>Holmes, supra,</i> at 268. Because \u00a7 1962(c) and \u00a7 1962(a) set forth distinct prohibitions, it is at least debatable whether Ideal's two claims should be analyzed in an identical fashion for proximate-cause purposes.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals held that Ideal adequately pleaded its \u00a7 1962(a) claim, see 373 F. 3d, at 264, but the court did not address proximate causation. We decline to consider Ideal's \u00a7 1962(a) claim without the benefit of the Court of Appeals' analysis, particularly given that the parties have devoted nearly all their attention in this Court to the \u00a7 1962(c) claim. We therefore vacate the Court of Appeals' judgment with respect to Ideal's \u00a7 1962(a) claim. On remand, the court should determine whether petitioners' alleged violation of \u00a7 1962(a) proximately caused the injuries Ideal asserts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed in part and vacated in part. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the opinion of the Court. I also note that it is inconceivable that the injury alleged in the 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1962(c) claim at issue here is within the zone of interests protected by the RICO cause of action for fraud perpetrated upon New York State. See <i>Holmes</i> v. <i>Securities Investor Protection Corporation,</i> 503 U. S. 258, 286-290 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*463</span> JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>The Court today limits the lawsuits that may be brought under the civil enforcement provision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO or Act), 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1961 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. III), by adopting a theory of proximate causation that is supported neither by the Act nor by our decision in <i>Holmes</i> v. <i>Securities Investor Protection Corporation,</i> 503 U. S. 258, 268 (1992), on which the Court principally relies. The Court's stringent proximate-causation requirement succeeds in precluding recovery in cases alleging a violation of \u00a7 1962(c) that, like the present one, have nothing to do with organized crime, the target of the RICO statute. However, the Court's approach also eliminates recovery for plaintiffs whose injuries are precisely those that Congress aimed to remedy through the authorization of civil RICO suits. Because this frustration of congressional intent is directly contrary to the broad language Congress employed to confer a RICO cause of action, I respectfully dissent from Part II of the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The language of the civil RICO provision, which broadly permits recovery by \"[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation\" of the Act's substantive restrictions, \u00a7 1964(c) (2000 ed.), plainly covers the lawsuit brought by respondent. Respondent alleges that it was injured in its business, and that this injury was the direct result of petitioners' violation of \u00a7 1962(c).<sup>[1]</sup> App. 12-17. In <span class=\"star-pagination\">*464</span> <i>Holmes,</i> however, we held that a RICO plaintiff is required to show that the RICO violation \"not only was a `but for' cause of his injury, but was the proximate cause as well.\" 503 U. S., at 268. We employed the term \"`proximate cause' to label generically the judicial tools used to limit a person's responsibility for the consequences of that person's own acts.\" <i>Ibid.</i> These tools reflect \"`ideas of what justice demands, or of what is administratively possible and convenient.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \u00a7 41, p. 264 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser &amp; Keeton)).</p>\n<p>Invoking one of the common-law proximate-cause considerations, we held that a RICO plaintiff must prove \"some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\" 503 U. S., at 268. Today the Court applies this formulation to conclude that the \"attenuated relationship\" between the violation of \u00a7 1962(c) and Ideal's injury \"implicates fundamental concerns expressed in <i>Holmes</i>\" and that the \"absence of proximate causation is equally clear in both cases.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 459, 458. But the Court's determination relies on a theory of \"directness\" distinct from that adopted by <i>Holmes.</i></p>\n<p>In <i>Holmes,</i> the Court explained that \"a plaintiff who complained of harm flowing merely from the misfortunes visited upon a third person by the defendant's acts was generally said to stand at too remote a distance to recover.\" 503 U. S., at 268-269. The plaintiff in <i>Holmes</i> was indirect in precisely this sense. The defendant was alleged to have participated in a stock manipulation scheme that disabled two broker-dealers from meeting their obligations to customers. Accordingly, the plaintiff, Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), had to advance nearly $13 million to cover the claims of customers of those broker-dealers. SIPC attempted to sue based on the claim that it was subrogated to the rights of those customers of the broker-dealers who did not purchase manipulated securities. We held that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*465</span> the nonpurchasing customers' injury was not proximately caused by the defendant's conduct, because \"the conspirators have allegedly injured these customers only insofar as the stock manipulation first injured the broker-dealers and left them without the wherewithal to pay customers' claims.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 271.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Here, in contrast, it was not <i>New York's injury</i> that caused respondent's damages; rather, it was petitioners' own conduct\u0097namely, their underpayment of tax\u0097that permitted them to undercut respondent's prices and thereby take away its business. Indeed, the Court's acknowledgment that there is no appreciable risk of duplicative recovery here, in contrast to <i>Holmes, ante,</i> at 459, is effectively a concession that petitioners' damages are not indirect, as that term is used in <i>Holmes.</i> See 503 U. S., at 269 (\"[R]ecognizing claims of the indirectly injured would force courts to adopt complicated rules apportioning damages among plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury from the violative acts, to obviate the risk of multiple recoveries\"). The mere fact that New York is a direct victim of petitioners' RICO violation does not preclude Ideal's claim that it too is a direct victim. Because the petitioners' tax underpayment directly caused respondent's injury, <i>Holmes</i> does not bar respondent's recovery.</p>\n<p>The Court nonetheless contends that respondent has failed to demonstrate proximate cause. It does so by relying on our observation in <i>Holmes</i> that the directness requirement is appropriate because \"`[t]he less direct an injury is, the more difficult it becomes to ascertain the amount of a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*466</span> plaintiff's damages attributable to the violation, as distinct from other, independent, factors.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 458 (quoting <i>Holmes, supra,</i> at 269, in turn, citing <i>Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc.</i> v. <i>Carpenters,</i> 459 U. S. 519 (1983)). In <i>Holmes,</i> we noted that it would be hard for the District Court to determine how much of the broker-dealers' failure to pay their customers was due to the fraud and how much was due to other factors affecting the broker-dealers' business success. 503 U. S., at 273-274. The Court contends that here, as in <i>Holmes,</i> it is difficult to \"ascertain the damages caused by some remote action.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 458.</p>\n<p>The Court's reliance on the difficulty of ascertaining the amount of Ideal's damages caused by petitioners' unlawful acts to label those damages indirect is misguided. <i>Holmes</i> and <i>Associated General Contractors</i> simply held that one reason that <i>indirect</i> injuries should not be compensable is that such injuries are difficult to ascertain. <i>Holmes, supra,</i> at 269; <i>Associated Gen. Contractors, supra,</i> at 542. We did not adopt the converse proposition that any injuries that are difficult to ascertain must be classified as indirect for purposes of determining proximate causation.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Proximate cause and certainty of damages, while both related to the plaintiff's responsibility to prove that the amount of damages he seeks is fairly attributable to the defendant, are distinct requirements for recovery in tort.<sup>[4]</sup> See 4 Restatement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*467</span> (Second) of Torts \u00a7 912 (1977) (certainty of damages); 2 <i>id.,</i> \u00a7\u00a7 430-431 (1963-1964) (proximate causation). That is, to recover, a plaintiff must show <i>both</i> that his injury is sufficiently connected to the tort that \"the moral judgment and practical sense of mankind [will] recognize responsibility in the domain of morals,\" Sutherland 18, and that the specific pecuniary advantages, the loss of which is alleged as damages, \"would have resulted, and, therefore, that the act complained of prevented them,\" <i>id.,</i> at 106-107. <i>Holmes</i> and <i>Associated General Contractors</i> dealt primarily with the former showing. The Court's discussion of the union's \"highly speculative\" damages in <i>Associated General Contractors</i> focused not on the difficulty of proving the precise amount of damages, but with \"the tenuous and speculative character of the relationship between the alleged antitrust violation and the Union's alleged injury.\" 459 U. S., at 545. Here, the relationship between the alleged RICO violation and the alleged injury is clear: Petitioners underpaid sales tax, permitting them to undercharge sales tax, inflicting competitive injury on respondent. The question with which the Court expresses concern\u0097whether Ideal can prove the amount of its actual damages \"with sufficient certainty,\" Sutherland 106, 107, to permit recovery\u0097is simply not before the Court.</p>\n<p>It is nonetheless worth noting that the Court overstates the difficulties of proof faced by respondent in this case. Certainly the plaintiff in this case, as in all tort cases involving damage to business, must demonstrate that he suffered a harm caused by the tort, and not merely by external market conditions. See generally Prosser &amp; Keeton \u00a7 130, at 1014-1015, and nn. 92-99 (gathering cases authorizing liability for torts that \"depriv[e] the plaintiff of customers or other prospects\"); cf. <i>Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</i> v. <i>Broudo,</i> 544 U. S. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*468</span> 336, 342 (2005) (\"[A]n inflated purchase price will not itself constitute or proximately cause the relevant economic loss,\" absent evidence that it was the inflated price that actually caused harm). But under the facts as alleged by Ideal, National did not generally lower its prices, so the Court need not inquire into \"any number of reasons,\" <i>ante,</i> at 458, that it might have done so.<sup>[5]</sup> Instead, it simply <i>ceased charging tax</i> on cash sales, allegedly, and logically, because it had ceased reporting those sales and accordingly was not itself paying sales tax on them. App. 11-13. Nor is it fatal to Ideal's proof of damages that National could have continued to charge taxes to its customers and invested the additional money elsewhere. <i>Ante,</i> at 459. Had National actually done so, it might be difficult to ascertain the damages suffered by Ideal as a result of that investment. But the mere fact that National <i>could have</i> committed tax fraud without readily ascertainable injury to Ideal does not mean that its tax fraud <i>necessarily</i> caused no readily ascertainable injury in this case. Likewise, the Court is undoubtedly correct that \"Ideal's lost sales could have resulted from factors other than petitioners' alleged acts of fraud.\" <i>Ibid.</i> However, the means through which the fraudulent scheme was carried out\u0097with sales tax charged on noncash sales, but no tax charged on cash sales\u0097renders the damages more ascertainable than in the typical case of lost business. In any event, it is well within the expertise of a district court to evaluate testimony and evidence and determine what portion of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*469</span> Ideal's lost sales are attributable to National's lower prices and what portion to other factors.</p>\n<p>The Court also relies on an additional reason <i>Holmes</i> gave for limiting recovery to direct victims\u0097namely, that \"[t]he requirement of a direct causal connection is especially warranted where the immediate victims of an alleged RICO violation can be expected to vindicate the laws by pursuing their own claims.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 460 (citing <i>Holmes,</i> 503 U. S., at 269-270). Certainly, New York can sue here and vindicate the law, rendering respondent's enforcement of the law less necessary than it would be if respondent were the only direct victim of the illegal activity. But our recognition in <i>Holmes</i> that limiting recovery to direct victims would not undermine deterrence does not support the conclusion that any victim whose lawsuit is unnecessary for deterrence is an indirect victim. Indeed, in any tort case with multiple possible plaintiffs, a single plaintiff's lawsuit could suffice to vindicate the law. If multiple plaintiffs are direct victims of a tort, it would be unjust to declare some of their lawsuits unnecessary for deterrence, absent any basis for doing so in the relevant statute. Because respondent's injuries result from petitioners' fraud, and not from New York's injuries, respondent has a right to recover equal to that of New York.</p>\n<p>Application of common-law principles of proximate causation beyond the directness requirement likewise supports a finding that causation was sufficiently pleaded in this case. Though the <i>Holmes</i> Court noted that directness was \"one of [the] central elements\" it had considered in evaluating causation, it recognized that proximate causation took \"many shapes\" at common law. <i>Id.,</i> at 268, 269. Cf. Prosser &amp; Keeton \u00a7 42, at 273 (noting \"two contrasting theories of legal cause,\" one extending liability to, but not beyond, \"the scope of the `foreseeable risks,'\" and the other extending liability to, but not beyond, all \"`directly traceable'\" consequences <span class=\"star-pagination\">*470</span> and those indirect consequences that are foreseeable).<sup>[6]</sup> The proximate-cause limitation serves to ensure that \"a defendant is not answerable for anything beyond the natural, ordinary and reasonable consequences of his conduct.\" Sutherland 57. \"If one's fault happens to concur with something extraordinary, and therefore not likely to be foreseen, he will not be answerable for such unexpected result.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Based on this principle, courts have historically found proximate causation for injuries from natural causes, if a wrongful act \"rendered it probable that such an injury will occur,\" <i>id.,</i> at 62; for injuries where the plaintiff's reliance is the immediate cause, such as in an action for fraud, so long as the reliance was \"reasonably induced by the prior misconduct of the defendant,\" <i>id.,</i> at 62, 63; and for injuries where an innocent third party intervenes between the tortfeasor and the victim, such that the innocent third party is the <i>immediate</i> cause of the injury, so long as the tortfeasor \"contributed so effectually to [the injury] as to be regarded as the efficient or at least concurrent and responsible cause,\" <i>id.,</i> at 64, 65 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals, by limiting RICO plaintiffs to those who are \"`the targets, competitors and intended victims of the racketeering enterprise,'\" 373 F. 3d 251, 260 (CA2 2004) (quoting <i>Lerner</i> v. <i>Fleet Bank, N. A.,</i> 318 F. 3d 113, 124 (CA2 2003)), outlined a proximate-causation standard that falls well in line both with the reasoning behind having a proximate-cause requirement at all, and with the traditional applications of this standard to tortfeasors who caused injury only through a two-step process. The Court, in contrast, permits a defendant to evade liability for harms that are not only foreseeable, but the <i>intended</i> consequences of the defendant's unlawful behavior. A defendant may do so simply by concocting a scheme under which a further, lawful and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*471</span> intentional step <i>by the defendant</i> is required to inflict the injury. Such a rule precludes recovery for injuries for which the defendant is plainly morally responsible and which are suffered by easily identifiable plaintiffs. There is no basis in the RICO statute, in common-law tort, or in <i>Holmes</i> for reaching this result.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Because neither the plain language of the civil RICO provision nor our precedent supports the Court's holding, it must be rejected. It is worth noting, however, that while the Court's holding in the present case may prevent litigation in an area far removed from the concerns about organized crime that led to RICO's enactment, that holding also precludes civil recovery for losses sustained by business competitors as a result of quintessential organized criminal activity, cases Congress indisputably intended its broad language to reach.</p>\n<p>Congress plainly enacted RICO to address the problem of organized crime, and not to remedy general state-law criminal violations. See <i>H. J. Inc.</i> v. <i>Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.,</i> 492 U. S. 229, 245 (1989). There is some evidence, to be sure, that the drafters knew that RICO would have the potential to sweep more broadly than organized crime and did not find that problematic. <i>Id.,</i> at 246-248. Nevertheless, the Court has recognized that \"in its private civil version, RICO is evolving into something quite different from the original conception of its enactors.\" <i>Sedima, S. P. R. L.</i> v. <i>Imrex Co.,</i> 473 U. S. 479, 500 (1985).</p>\n<p>Judicial sentiment that civil RICO's evolution is undesirable is widespread.<sup>[7]</sup> Numerous Justices have expressed dissatisfaction <span class=\"star-pagination\">*472</span> with either the breadth of RICO's application, <i>id.,</i> at 501 (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, Blackmun, and Powell, JJ., dissenting) (\"The Court's interpretation of the civil RICO statute quite simply revolutionizes private litigation; it validates the federalization of broad areas of state common law of frauds, and it approves the displacement of well-established federal remedial provisions. . . . [T]here is no indication that Congress even considered, much less approved, the scheme that the Court today defines\"), or its general vagueness at outlining the conduct it is intended to prohibit, <i>H. J. Inc., supra,</i> at 255-256 (Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor and Kennedy, JJ., concurring in judgment) (\"No constitutional challenge to this law has been raised in the present case . . . . That the highest Court in the land has been unable to derive from this statute anything more than today's meager guidance bodes ill for the day when that challenge is presented\"). Indeed, proposals for curtailing civil RICO have been introduced in Congress; for example, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, enacted in 1995, removed securities fraud as a predicate act under RICO. Pub. L. 104-67, \u00a7 107, 109 Stat. 758, amending 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1964(c); see also Abrams, Crime Legislation and the Public Interest: Lessons from Civil RICO, 50 SMU L. Rev. 33, 34 (1996).</p>\n<p>This case, like the majority of civil RICO cases, has no apparent connection to organized crime. See <i>Sedima,</i> 473 U. S., at 499, n. 16 (quoting an ABA Task Force determination that, over the period reviewed, only 9% of civil RICO cases at the trial court level involved \"`allegations of criminal activity of a type generally associated with professional criminals'\"). Given the distance the facts of this case lie <span class=\"star-pagination\">*473</span> from the prototypical organized criminal activity that led to RICO's enactment, it is tempting to find in the Act a limitation that will keep at least this and similar cases out of court.</p>\n<p>The Court's attempt to exclude this case from the reach of civil RICO, however, succeeds in eliminating not only cases that lie far outside the harm RICO was intended to correct, but also those that were at the core of Congress' concern in enacting the statute. The Court unanimously recognized in <i>Sedima</i> that one reason\u0097and, for the dissent, the principal reason\u0097Congress enacted RICO was to protect businesses against competitive injury from organized crime. See <i>id.,</i> at 500-523 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (concluding that the provision conferring a right of action on individual plaintiffs had as its \"principal target . . . the economic power of racketeers, and its toll on legitimate businessmen\"); <i>id.,</i> at 494-500.</p>\n<p>The unanimous view of the <i>Sedima</i> Court is correct. The sponsor of a Senate precursor to RICO noted that \"`<i>the</i> evil to be curbed is the unfair competitive advantage inherent in the large amount of illicit income available to organized crime.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 514 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (quoting 113 Cong. Rec. 17999 (1967) (remarks of Sen. Hruska); some emphasis deleted); see also 473 U. S., at 515 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (\"`When organized crime moves into a business, it brings all the techniques of violence and intimidation which it used in its illegal businesses. Competitors are eliminated and customers confined to sponsored suppliers'\"). Upon adding a provision for a civil remedy in a subsequently proposed bill, Senator Hruska noted:</p>\n<blockquote>\"`[This] bill also creates civil remedies for the honest businessman who has been damaged by unfair competition from the racketeer businessman. Despite the willingness of the courts to apply the Sherman Anti-Trust Act to organized crime activities, as a practical matter the legitimate businessman does not have adequate civil remedies available under that act. This bill fills that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*474</span> gap.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 516 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (quoting 115 Cong. Rec. 6993 (1969); emphasis deleted).</blockquote>\n<p>A portion of these bills was ultimately included in RICO, which was attached as Title IX to the Organized Crime Control Act. The Committee Report noted that the Title \"has as its purpose the elimination of the infiltration of organized crime and racketeering into legitimate organizations operating in interstate commerce.\" S. Rep. No. 91-617, p. 76 (1969).</p>\n<p>The observations of the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, the source of much of the congressional concern over organized crime, are consistent with these statements. Its chapter on organized crime noted that \"organized crime is also extensively and deeply involved in legitimate business . . . . [I]t employs illegitimate methods\u0097monopolization, terrorism, extortion, tax evasion\u0097to drive out or control lawful ownership and leadership and to exact illegal profits from the public.\" The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society 187 (1967). The report noted that \"[t]he millions of dollars [organized crime] can throw into the legitimate economic system gives it power to manipulate the price of shares on the stock market, to raise or lower the price of retail merchandise, to determine whether entire industries are union or nonunion, to make it easier or harder for businessmen to continue in business.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>It is not difficult to imagine a competitive injury to a business that would result from the kind of organized crime that <i>Sedima,</i> Congress, and the Commission all recognized as the principal concern of RICO, yet that would fail the Court's restrictive proximate-cause test. For example, an organized crime group, running a legitimate business, could, through threats of violence, persuade its supplier to sell goods to it at cost, so that it could resell those goods at a lower price to drive its competitor out of the business. Honest businessmen would be unable to compete, as they do not engage in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*475</span> threats of violence to lower their costs. Civil RICO, if it was intended to do anything at all, was intended to give those businessmen a cause of action. Cf. <i>Sedima,</i> 473 U. S., at 521-522 (Marshall, J., dissenting). Yet just like respondent, those businessmen would not themselves be the immediate target of the threats; the target would be the supplier. Like respondent's injury, their injury would be most immediately caused by the lawful activity of price competition, not the unlawful activity of threatening the supplier. Accordingly, under the Court's view, the honest businessman competitor would be just an \"indirect\" victim, whose injury was not proximately caused by the RICO violation.<sup>[8]</sup> Civil RICO would thus confer no right to sue on the individual who did not himself suffer the threats of violence, even if the threats caused him harm.</p>\n<p>As a result, after today, civil RICO plaintiffs that suffer precisely the kind of injury that motivated the adoption of the civil RICO provision will be unable to obtain relief. If this result was compelled by the text of the statute, the interference with congressional intent would be unavoidable. Given that the language is not even fairly susceptible of such a reading, however, I cannot agree with this frustration of congressional intent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Because I conclude that Ideal has sufficiently pleaded proximate cause, I must proceed to the question which the Court does not reach: whether reliance is a required element of a RICO claim predicated on mail or wire fraud and, if it is, whether that reliance must be by the plaintiff. The Court of Appeals held that reliance is required, but that \"a RICO claim based on mail fraud may be proven where the misrepresentations were relied on by a third person, rather than <span class=\"star-pagination\">*476</span> by the plaintiff.\" 373 F. 3d, at 262, 263. I disagree with the conclusion that reliance is required at all. In my view, the mere fact that the predicate acts underlying a particular RICO violation happen to be fraud offenses does not mean that reliance, an element of common-law fraud, is also incorporated as an element of a civil RICO claim.</p>\n<p>Petitioners are correct that the common law generally required a showing of justifiable reliance before a plaintiff could recover for damages caused by fraud. See <i>Neder</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 527 U. S. 1, 24-25 (1999); Prosser &amp; Keeton \u00a7 105, at 728. But RICO does not confer on private plaintiffs a right to sue defendants who engage in any act of commonlaw fraud; instead, racketeering activity includes, as relevant to this case, \"any act which is indictable under [18 U. S. C. \u00a7] 1341 (relating to mail fraud) [and \u00a7] 1343 (relating to wire fraud).\" \u00a7 1961(1) (2000 ed., Supp. III). And we have recognized that these criminal fraud statutes \"did not incorporate <i>all</i> the elements of common-law fraud.\" <i>Neder,</i> 527 U. S., at 24. Instead, the criminal mail fraud statute applies to anyone who, \"having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud . . . for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, places in any post office . . . any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by the Postal Service . . . .\" \u00a7 1341. See \u00a7 1343 (similar language for wire fraud). We have specifically noted that \"[b]y prohibiting the `scheme to defraud,' rather than the completed fraud, the elements of reliance . . . would clearly be inconsistent with the statutes Congress enacted.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 25.</p>\n<p>Because an individual can commit an indictable act of mail or wire fraud even if no one relies on his fraud, he can engage in a pattern of racketeering activity, in violation of \u00a7 1962, without proof of reliance. Accordingly, it cannot be disputed that the Government could prosecute a person for such behavior. The terms of \u00a7 1964(c) (2000 ed.), which broadly authorize suit by \"[a]ny person injured in his business or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*477</span> property by reason of a violation of section 1962,\" permit no different conclusion when an individual brings a civil action against such a RICO violator.</p>\n<p>It is true that our decision in <i>Holmes</i> to apply the common-law proximate-cause requirement was likewise not compelled by the broad language of the statute. But our decision in that case was justified by the \"very unlikelihood that Congress meant to allow all factually injured plaintiffs to recover.\" 503 U. S., at 266. This unlikelihood stems, in part, from the nature of proximate cause, which is \"not only a general condition of civil liability at common law but is almost essential to shape and delimit a rational remedy.\" <i>Systems Management, Inc.</i> v. <i>Loiselle,</i> 303 F. 3d 100, 104 (CA1 2002). We also decided <i>Holmes</i> in light of Congress' decision to use the same words to impose civil liability under RICO as it had in \u00a7 7 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 210, into which federal courts had implied a proximate-cause limitation. 503 U. S., at 268. Accordingly, it was fair to interpret the broad language \"by reason of\" as meaning, in all civil RICO cases, that the violation must be both the cause-in-fact and the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury.</p>\n<p>Here, by contrast, the civil action provision cannot be read to always require that the plaintiff have relied on the defendant's action. Reliance is not a general limitation on civil recovery in tort; it \"is a specialized condition that happens to have grown up with common law fraud.\" <i>Loiselle, supra,</i> at 104. For most of the predicate acts underlying RICO violations, it cannot be argued that the common law, if it even recognized such acts as civilly actionable, required proof of reliance. See \u00a7 1961 (2000 ed., Supp. III). In other words, there is no language in \u00a7 1964(c) (2000 ed.) that could fairly be read to add a reliance requirement in fraud cases only. Nor is there any reason to believe that Congress would have defined \"racketeering activity\" to include acts indictable under the mail and wire fraud statutes, if it intended fraud-related acts to be predicate acts under RICO only <span class=\"star-pagination\">*478</span> when those acts would have been actionable under the common law.</p>\n<p>Because reliance cannot be read into \u00a7\u00a7 1341 and 1343, nor into RICO itself, it is not an element of a civil RICO claim. This is not to say that, in the general case, a plaintiff will not have to prove that someone relied on the predicate act of fraud as part of his case. If, for example, New York had not believed petitioners' misrepresentation with respect to their sales, Ideal may well not have been injured by petitioners' scheme, which would have faltered at the first step. Indeed, petitioners recognize that \"in the ordinary misrepresentation case, the reliance requirement simply functions as a necessary prerequisite to establishing the causation required by the language of \u00a7 1964(c).\" Brief for Petitioners 29. But the fact that proof of reliance is often used to prove an element of the plaintiff's cause of action, such as the element of causation, does not transform reliance itself into an element of the cause of action. See <i>Loiselle, supra,</i> at 104 (\"Reliance is doubtless the most obvious way in which fraud can cause harm, but it is not the only way\"). Because respondent need not allege reliance at all, its complaint, which alleges that New York relied on petitioners' misrepresentations, App. 16, is more than sufficient.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The Congress that enacted RICO may never have intended to reach cases like the one before us, and may have \"federalize[d] a great deal of state common law\" without any intention of \"produc[ing] these far-reaching results.\" <i>Sedima,</i> 473 U. S., at 506 (Marshall, J., dissenting). But this Court has always refused to ignore the language of the statute to limit it to \"the archetypal, intimidating mobster,\" and has instead recognized that \"[i]t is not for the judiciary to eliminate the private action in situations where Congress has provided it simply because plaintiffs are not taking advantage of it in its more difficult applications.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 499-500. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*479</span> Today, however, the Court not only eliminates private RICO actions in some situations Congress may have inadvertently regulated, but it substantially limits the ability of civil RICO to reach even those cases that motivated Congress' enactment of this provision in the first place. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>In my view, the civil damages remedy in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968 (2000 ed. and Supp. III), does not cover claims of injury by one competitor where the legitimate procompetitive activity of another competitor immediately causes that injury. I believe that this is such a case and would consequently hold that RICO does not authorize the private action here at issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>RICO essentially seeks to prevent organized criminals from taking over or operating legitimate businesses. Its language, however, extends its scope well beyond those central purposes. RICO begins by listing certain predicate acts, called \"`racketeering activity,'\" which consist of other crimes, ranging from criminal copyright activities, the facilitation of gambling, and mail fraud to arson, kidnaping, and murder. \u00a7 1961(1) (2000 ed., Supp. III). It then defines a \"`pattern of racketeering activity'\" to include engaging in \"at least two\" predicate acts in a 10-year period. \u00a7 1961(5) (2000 ed.). And it forbids certain business-related activities involving such a \"pattern\" and an \"enterprise.\" The forbidden activities include using funds derived from a \"pattern of racketeering activity\" in acquiring, establishing, or operating any enterprise, and conducting the affairs of any enterprise through such \"a pattern.\" \u00a7\u00a7 1962(a), (c).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*480</span> RICO, a federal criminal statute, foresees criminal law enforcement by the Federal Government. \u00a7 1963 (2000 ed., Supp. III). It also sets forth civil remedies. \u00a7 1964 (2000 ed.). District courts \"have jurisdiction to prevent and restrain [RICO] violations.\" \u00a7 1964(a). And a person \"injured in his business or property by reason of a [RICO] violation\" may seek treble damages and attorney's fees. \u00a7 1964(c).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The present case is a private RICO treble-damages action. A steel supply company, Ideal Steel, has sued a competing steel supply company, National Steel, and its owners, Joseph and Vincent Anza (to whom I shall refer collectively as \"National\"). Ideal says that National committed mail fraud by regularly filing false New York state sales tax returns in order to avoid paying sales tax that it owed\u0097activity that amounts to a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\" This activity enabled National to charge lower prices without reducing its profit margins. Ideal says National used some of these excess profits to fund the building of a new store. Both the lower prices and the new outlet attracted Ideal customers, thereby injuring Ideal. Hence, says Ideal, it was injured \"in [its] business . . . by reason of\" violations of two RICO provisions, the provision that forbids conducting an \"enterprise's affairs\" through a \"pattern of racketeering activity\" and the provision that forbids investing funds derived from such a \"pattern\" in an \"enterprise.\" \u00a7\u00a7 1962(c), (a), 1964(c). The question before us is whether RICO permits Ideal to bring this private treble-damages claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>This Court, in <i>Holmes</i> v. <i>Securities Investor Protection Corporation,</i> 503 U. S. 258, 268 (1992), held that RICO's private treble-damages provision \"demand[ed] . . . some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\" The Court then determined that the injury <span class=\"star-pagination\">*481</span> alleged by the plaintiff in that case was too remote from the injurious conduct to satisfy this requirement.</p>\n<p>I do not agree with the majority insofar as it believes that <i>Holmes'</i> holding in respect to the fact pattern there at issue virtually dictates the answer to the question here. In my view, the \"causal connection\" between the forbidden conduct and plaintiff's harm is, in certain key ways, more direct here than it was in <i>Holmes.</i> In <i>Holmes,</i> the RICO plaintiff was a surrogate for creditors of broker-dealers that went bankrupt after losing money in stocks that had been overvalued due to fraudulent statements made by the RICO defendant and others. Put in terms of \"proximate cause,\" the plaintiff's harm (an ordinary creditor loss) differed in kind from the harm that the \"predicate acts\" (securities fraud) would ordinarily cause (stock-related monetary losses). The harm was \"indirect\" in the sense that it was entirely derivative of the more direct harm the defendant's actions had caused the broker-dealers; and, there were several steps between the violation and the harm (misrepresentation\u0097broker-dealer losses\u0097broker-dealer business failure\u0097ordinary creditor loss). Here, however, the plaintiff alleges a harm (lost customers) that flows directly from the lower prices and the opening of a new outlet\u0097actions that were themselves allegedly caused by activity that Congress designed RICO to forbid (conducting a business through a \"pattern\" of \"predicate acts\" and investing in business funds derived from such a \"pattern\"). In this sense, the causal links before us are more \"direct\" than those in <i>Holmes.</i> See <i>ante,</i> at 464-465 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, I agree with the majority that <i>Holmes</i> points the way. That case makes clear that RICO contains important limitations on the scope of private rights of action. It specifies that RICO does not provide a private right of action \"simply on showing that the defendant violated \u00a7 1962, the plaintiff was injured, and the defendant's violation was a `but for' cause of [the] plaintiff's injury.\" 503 U. S., at 265-266 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*482</span> (footnote omitted). Pointing out \"the very unlikelihood that Congress meant to allow <i>all</i> factually injured plaintiffs to recover,\" <i>id.,</i> at 266 (emphasis added), <i>Holmes</i> concludes that RICO imposes a requirement of \"proximate cause,\" a phrase that \"label[s] generically the judicial tools used to limit a person's responsibility for the consequences of that person's own acts,\" <i>id.,</i> at 268. It recognizes that these tools seek to discern \"`what justice demands, or . . . what is administratively possible and convenient.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \u00a7 41, p. 264 (5th ed. 1984)). It also explains that \"proximate cause\" demands \"directness,\" while specifying that \"directness\" is only one of \"the many shapes this concept took at common law.\" 503 U. S., at 268, 269. And it points to antitrust law, both as a source of RICO's trebledamages provisions and as an aid to their interpretation. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>In my view, the \"antitrust\" nature of the treble-damages provision's source, taken together with both RICO's basic objectives and important administrative concerns, implies that a cause is \"indirect,\" <i>i. e.,</i> it is not a \"proximate cause,\" if the causal chain from forbidden act to the injury caused a competitor proceeds through a legitimate business' ordinary competitive activity. To use a physical metaphor, ordinary competitive actions undertaken by the defendant competitor cut the <i>direct</i> causal link between the plaintiff competitor's injuries and the forbidden acts.</p>\n<p>The basic objective of antitrust law is to encourage the competitive process. In particular, that law encourages businesses to compete by offering lower prices, better products, better methods of production, and better systems of distribution. See, <i>e. g.,</i> 1 P. Areeda &amp; H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application \u00b6 100a, pp. 3-4 (2d ed. 2000). As I shall explain, these principles suggest that RICO does not permit private action based solely upon this competitive type of harm, <i>i. e.,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*483</span> harm a plaintiff suffers only because the defendant was able to attract customers through normal competitive methods, such as lower prices, better products, better methods of production, or better systems of distribution. In such cases, the harm falls outside the limits that RICO's private trebledamages provision's \"proximate-cause\" requirement imposes. In such cases the distance between the harm and the predicate acts that funded (or otherwise enabled) such ordinary competitive activity is too distant. The harm is not \"direct.\"</p>\n<p>At the same time, those principles suggest that other types of competitive injuries not within their protective ambit could lie within, not outside, \"proximate-cause\" limits. Where, for example, a RICO defendant attracts customers in ways that involve illegitimate competitive means, <i>e. g.,</i> by threatening violence, a claim may still lie. Claims involving RICO violations that objectively target a particular competitor, <i>e. g.,</i> bribing an official to harass a competitor, could also be actionable.</p>\n<p>Several considerations lead to this conclusion. First, I have found no case (outside the Second Circuit, from which this case arose) in which a court has authorized a private treble-damages suit based upon no more than a legitimate business' ordinary procompetitive activity (even where financed by the proceeds of a RICO predicate act).</p>\n<p>Second, an effort to bring harm caused by ordinary competitive activity within the scope of RICO's private trebledamages action provision will raise serious problems of administrability. <i>Ante,</i> at 458-460 (majority opinion); see also <i>Holmes, supra,</i> at 269. To demonstrate that a defendant's lower price caused a plaintiff to lose customers (or profits) requires the plaintiff to show what would have happened in its absence. Would customers have changed suppliers irrespective of the price change because of other differences in the suppliers? Would other competing firms have lowered their prices? Would higher prices have attracted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*484</span> new entry? Would demand for the industry's product, or the geographic scope of the relevant market, have changed? If so, how? To answer such questions based upon actual market circumstances and to apportion damages among the various competitors harmed is difficult even for plaintiffs trying to trace harm caused by a defendants' <i>anti</i>-competitive behavior. <i>Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc.</i> v. <i>Carpenters,</i> 459 U. S. 519, 542, 544 (1983) (the possibility that harm \"may have been produced by independent factors\" and \"the danger of complex apportionment of damages\" weigh against finding the requisite causal connection in an antitrust case). To answer such questions in the context of better functioning markets, where prices typically reflect competitive conditions, would likely prove yet more difficult.</p>\n<p>Third, where other victims, say, victims of the underlying RICO \"predicate acts\" are present, there is no pressing need to provide such an action. Those alternative victims (here the State of New York) typically \"could be counted on to bring suit for the law's vindication.\" <i>Holmes, supra,</i> at 273. They could thus fulfill Congress' aim in adopting the civil remedy of \"turn[ing victims] into prosecutors, `private attorneys general,' dedicated to eliminating racketeering activity.\" <i>Rotella</i> v. <i>Wood,</i> 528 U. S. 549, 557 (2000) (citing <i>Klehr</i> v. <i>A. O. Smith Corp.,</i> 521 U. S. 179, 187 (1997)).</p>\n<p>Fourth, this approach to proximate cause would retain private actions aimed at the heart of Congress' relevant RICO concerns. RICO's sponsors, in reporting their underlying reasons for supporting RICO, emphasized, not the fair, ordinary competition that an infiltrated business might offer its competitors, but the risk that such a business would act corruptly, exercising <i>unfair</i> methods of competition. S. Rep. No. 91-617, pp. 76-78 (1969); see also <i>Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd.</i> v. <i>King,</i> 533 U. S. 158, 165 (2001). RICO focuses upon the \"infiltration of legitimate business by organized crime,\" in significant part because, when \"`organized crime moves into a business, it brings all the techniques of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*485</span> violence and intimidation which it used in its illegal businesses.'\" <i>Sedima, S. P. R. L.</i> v. <i>Imrex Co.,</i> 473 U. S. 479, 517, 515 (1985) (Marshall, J., dissenting) (quoting 113 Cong. Rec. 17999 (1967)).</p>\n<p>My approach would not rule out private actions in such cases. Nor would it rule out three of the four suits mentioned by Justice Marshall, dissenting in <i>Sedima,</i> when he describes RICO's objectives. It would not rule out lawsuits by injured competitors or legitimate investors if a racketeer, \"uses `[t]hreats, arson and assault . . . to force competitors out of business'\"; \"uses arson and threats to induce honest businessmen to pay protection money, or to purchase certain goods, or to hire certain workers\"; or \"displace[s]\" an \"honest investor\" when he \"infiltrates and obtains control of a legitimate business . . . through fraud\" or the like. 473 U. S., at 521, 522.</p>\n<p>I concede that the approach would rule out a competitor's lawsuit based on no more than an \"infiltrated enterprise\" operating a legitimate business to a businessman's competitive disadvantage because unlawful predicate acts helped that legitimate business build a \"strong economic base.\" And I recognize that this latter kind of suit at least arguably would have provided helpful deterrence had the view of <i>Sedima's dissenting Justices</i> prevailed. <i>Id.,</i> at 500-523 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (arguing that RICO's private action provision did not authorize suits based on harm flowing directly from predicate acts); <i>id.,</i> at 523-530 (Powell, J., dissenting) (same). But the dissent did not prevail, and the need for deterrence consequently offers only weakened support for a reading of RICO that authorizes private suits in this category.</p>\n<p>Fifth, without this limitation, RICO enforcement and basic antitrust policy could well collide. Firms losing the competitive battle might find bases for a RICO attack on their more successful competitors in claimed misrepresentations or even comparatively minor misdeeds by that competitor. Firms <span class=\"star-pagination\">*486</span> that fear such treble-damages suits might hesitate to compete vigorously, particularly in concentrated industries where harm to a competitor is more easily traced but where the consumer's need for vigorous competition is particularly strong. The ultimate victim of any such tendency to pull ordinary competitive punches of course would be not the competing business, but the consumer. Although Congress did not intend its RICO treble-damages provision as a simple copy of the antitrust laws' similar remedies, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Sedima, supra,</i> at 498-499, there is no sound reason to interpret RICO's treble-damages provision as if Congress intended to set it and its antitrust counterpart at cross-purposes.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I would read into the private trebledamages provision a \"proximate-cause\" limitation that places outside the provision harms that are traceable to an unlawful act only through a form of legitimate competitive activity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Applying this approach to the present case, I would hold that neither of Ideal's counts states a RICO private trebledamages claim. National is a legitimate business. Another private plaintiff (the State of New York) is available. The question is whether Ideal asserts a harm caused directly by something other than ordinary competitive activity, <i>i. e.,</i> lower prices, a better product, a better distribution system, or a better production method.</p>\n<p>Ideal's second count claims injury caused by National's (1) having taken customers (2) attracted by its new store (3) that it financed in part through profits generated by the tax fraud scheme, and the financing is the relevant violation. \u00a7 1962(a). The opening of a distribution outlet is a legitimate competitive activity. It benefits the firm that opens it by making it more convenient for customers to purchase from that supplier. That ordinary competitive process is all the complaint describes. And for the reasons I have given <span class=\"star-pagination\">*487</span> in Part II, <i>supra,</i> I believe that the financing of a new store\u0097even with funds generated by unlawful activities\u0097is not sufficient to create a private cause of action as long as the activity funded amounts to legitimate competitive activity. Ideal must look for other remedies, <i>e. g.,</i> bringing the facts to the attention of the United States Attorney or the State of New York.</p>\n<p>Ideal's first count presents a more difficult question. It alleges that National filed false sales tax returns to the State of New York. As an action indictable under the federal mail fraud statute, that action is a predicate act under RICO. See \u00a7 1961(1) (2000 ed., Supp. III). National passed these savings on to its cash customers by not charging them sales tax, thereby attracting more cash customers than it would have without the scheme. Is this a form of injury caused, not by ordinary competitive activity, but simply by the predicate act itself?</p>\n<p>In my view, the answer to this question is \"no.\" The complaint alleges predicate acts that amount simply to the facts that National did not \"charge\" or \"pay\" sales taxes or accurately \"report\" sales figures to the State. National did not tell its customers, \"We shall not pay sales taxes.\" Rather, it simply charged the customer a lower price, say, $100 rather than $100 plus $8 tax. Consider a retailer who advertises to the customer a $100 table and adds, \"We pay all sales taxes.\" Such a retailer is telling the customer that he will charge the customer a lower price by the amount of the tax, <i>i. e.,</i> about $92. The retailer implies that he, the retailer, will pay the tax to the State, taking the requisite amount owed to the State from the $100 the customer paid for the item.</p>\n<p>The defendants here have done no more. They have in effect cut the price of the item by the amount of the sales tax and then kept the money instead of passing it on to the State. They funded the price cut from the savings, but the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*488</span> source of the savings is, in my view, beside the point as long as the price cut itself is legitimate. I can find nothing in the complaint that suggests it is not.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals on both counts.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  <i>Gene C. Schaerr, Linda T. Coberly, Charles B. Klein, Robin S. Conrad,</i> and <i>Amar D. Sarwal</i> filed a brief for the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America as <i>amicus curiae</i> urging reversal.\n</p>\n<p><i>Henry H. Rossbacher</i> and <i>G. Robert Blakey</i> filed a brief for the National Association of Shareholder and Consumer Attorneys as <i>amicus curiae</i> urging affirmance.</p>\n<p>[1]  Respondent also alleges that petitioners injured its business through a violation of \u00a7 1962(a), although the parties dedicate little attention to this issue. In light of the Court's disposition of the \u00a7 1962(c) claim and the limited discussion of \u00a7 1962(a) by the parties, I agree with the Court that we should give the Court of Appeals the first opportunity to reconsider the \u00a7 1962(a) claim. Accordingly, I join Part III of the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p>[2]  Sutherland's treatise on damages, on which the Court relied in <i>Holmes,</i> labels the same type of claims indirect: those where one party is injured, and it is that very injury\u0097and not the wrongful behavior by the tortfeasor\u0097that causes the injury to the plaintiff. See 1 J. Sutherland, Law of Damages 55 (1882) (hereinafter Sutherland). Indeed, every example cited in Sutherland in illustration of this principle parallels <i>Holmes;</i> the plaintiff would not be injured absent the injury to another victim. See Sutherland 55-56.</p>\n<p>[3]  Indeed, in <i>Associated General Contractors,</i> we did not even squarely hold that the reason that indirect damages are not compensable was that the damages were not easily ascertainable; instead, we merely recognized the empirical fact that \"[p]artly because it is indirect, and partly because the alleged effects on the Union may have been produced by independent factors, the Union's damages claim is also highly speculative.\" 459 U. S., at 542.</p>\n<p>[4]  Sutherland described the interrelation between the two concepts: \"A fatal uncertainty may infect a case where an injury is easily provable, but the alleged responsible cause cannot be sufficiently established as to the whole or some part of that injury. So it may exist where a known and provable wrong or violation of contract appears, but the alleged loss or injury as a result of it cannot be certainly shown.\" Sutherland 94.</p>\n<p>[5]  Nor is it fair to require a plaintiff to prove that the tort caused the lowering of prices at the motion to dismiss stage. Ideal's complaint alleges that petitioners \"pass on to National's customers the sales tax `savings' that National realizes as a result of its false returns.\" App. 16. This allegation that, as a factual matter, National was able to charge a lower price after tax because of its fraud suffices to permit Ideal to survive a motion to dismiss on the question whether the prices were lowered due to the fraud, as opposed to other factors.</p>\n<p>[6]  Prosser and Keeton appear to use \"direct\" in a broader sense than that adopted by the Court in <i>Holmes.</i> See Prosser &amp; Keeton \u00a7 43, at 273, 293-297.</p>\n<p>[7]  See Rehnquist, Remarks of the Chief Justice, 21 St. Mary's L. J. 5, 13 (1989) (\"I think that the time has arrived for Congress to enact amendments to civil RICO to limit its scope to the sort of wrongs that are connected to organized crime, or have some other reason for being in federal court\"); Sentelle, Civil RICO: The Judges' Perspective, and Some Notes on Practice for North Carolina Lawyers, 12 Campbell L. Rev. 145, 148 (1990) (\"[E]very single district judge with whom I have discussed the subject (and I'm talking in the dozens of district judges from across the country) echoes the entreaty expressed in the Chief Justice's title in <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>[, Get RICO Cases Out of My Courtroom, May 19, 1989, p. A14, col. 4]\").</p>\n<p>[8]  The honest businessman would likewise fail Justice Scalia's theory of proximate causation, because laws against threats of violence are intended to protect those who are so threatened, not other parties that might suffer as a consequence. <i>Ante,</i> at 462 (concurring opinion).</p>\n\n</div>",

Se\n  curities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 268. Respon\n  dent Ideal Steel Supply Corporation (Ideal) has stores in Queens and\n  the Bronx. Petitioner National Steel Supply, Inc. (National), owned\n  by petitioners Joseph and Vincent Anza, has stores in the same loca\n  tions and is Ideal\u2019s principal competitor. Ideal filed suit in the Dis\n  trict Court, claiming that National failed to charge New York\u2019s sales\n  tax to cash-paying customers, allowing it to reduce its prices without\n  affecting its profit margin; and that it submitted fraudulent state tax\n  returns to conceal the conduct, which involved committing mail and\n  wire fraud, both forms of \u201cracketeering activity\u201d under RICO. Ideal\n  alleged that the Anzas violated \u00a71962(c), which forbids conducting or\n  participating in the conduct of an enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pat\n  tern of racketeering activity. It also claimed that all the petitioners\n  violated \u00a71962(a)\u2014which makes it unlawful for a person \u201cto use or\n  invest\u201d income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity in an\n  enterprise engaged in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce\u2014\n  when they used funds generated by the fraudulent tax scheme to\n  open National\u2019s Bronx location, causing Ideal to lose business and\n  market share.

Vacating, the Second\n2                ANZA v. IDEAL STEEL SUPPLY CORP.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    Circuit held, with regard to the \u00a71962(c) claim, that a complaint al\n    leging a pattern of racketeering activity designed to give a defendant\n    a competitive advantage adequately pleaded probable cause even\n    where the scheme depended on fraudulent communications made to a\n    third party; and held that Ideal adequately pleaded its \u00a71962(a) claim\n    by alleging injury resulting from petitioners\u2019 use and investment of\n    racketeering proceeds.\nHeld:\n    1. Ideal cannot maintain its \u00a71962(c) claim. Under Holmes, proxi\n mate cause for \u00a71964(c) purposes requires \u201csome direct relation be\n tween the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d 503\n U. S., at 268. The direct victim of the alleged RICO violation is the\n State of New York, not Ideal. Ideal\u2019s claim is too attenuated to sat\n isfy Holmes\u2019 requirement of directness. This result is confirmed by\n the directness requirement\u2019s underlying premises, one of which is the\n difficulty that can arise when a court attempts to ascertain the dam\n ages caused by some remote action. Ideal claims lost sales because of\n National\u2019s decreased prices, but National could have lowered prices\n for reasons unrelated to the asserted tax fraud, and Ideal\u2019s lost sales\n could have resulted from other factors as well. The attenuated con\n nection between Ideal\u2019s injury and the Anzas\u2019 injurious conduct thus\n implicates fundamental concerns expressed in Holmes. Further illus\n trating the absence of proximate cause is the speculative nature of\n the proceedings that would follow if Ideal were permitted to maintain\n its claim. A court would have to calculate the portion of National\u2019s\n price drop attributable to the pattern of racketeering activity and\n then calculate the portion of lost sales attributable to the relevant\n part of the price drop, but Holmes\u2019 proximate causation element was\n meant to prevent such intricate, uncertain inquiries from overrun\n ning RICO litigation. A direct causal connection is especially war\n ranted where the immediate victims can be expected to vindicate the\n laws by pursuing their own claims. Contrary to the Second Circuit\u2019s\n rationale, a RICO plaintiff cannot circumvent the proximate-cause\n requirement simply by claiming that the defendant\u2019s aim was to in\n crease market share at a competitor\u2019s expense. Because Ideal has not\n satisfied that requirement, this Court has no occasion to address the\n substantial question whether a plaintiff asserting a RICO claim\n predicated on mail or wire fraud must show that it relied on the de\n fendant\u2019s misrepresentations. Pp. 4\u20139.\n    2. The Second Circuit\u2019s judgment with respect to Ideal\u2019s \u00a71962(a)\n claim is vacated so that court can determine on remand whether peti\n tioners\u2019 alleged \u00a71962(a) violation proximately caused Ideal\u2019s asserted\n injuries.

IDEAL STEEL SUPPLY CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Respondent Ideal Steel Supply Corporation (Ideal) sells\nsteel mill products along with related supplies and ser\nvices. It operates two store locations in New York, one in\nQueens and the other in the Bronx. Petitioner National\nSteel Supply, Inc. (National), owned by petitioners Joseph\nand Vincent Anza, is Ideal\u2019s principal competitor. Na\ntional offers a similar array of products and services, and\nit, too, operates one store in Queens and one in the Bronx.\n   Ideal sued petitioners in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York. It claimed\npetitioners were engaged in an unlawful racketeering\nscheme aimed at \u201cgain[ing] sales and market share at\nIdeal\u2019s expense.\u201d App. 7. According to Ideal, National\nadopted a practice of failing to charge the requisite New\nYork sales tax to cash-paying customers, even when con\nducting transactions that were not exempt from sales tax\nunder state law. This practice allowed National to reduce\nits prices without affecting its profit margin. Petitioners\nallegedly submitted fraudulent tax returns to the New\nYork State Department of Taxation and Finance in an\neffort to conceal their conduct.\n   Ideal\u2019s amended complaint contains, as relevant here,\ntwo RICO claims. The claims assert that petitioners, by\nsubmitting the fraudulent tax returns, committed various\nacts of mail fraud (when they sent the returns by mail)\nand wire fraud (when they sent them electronically). See\n18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71341, 1343 (2000 ed., Supp. III). Mail fraud\nand wire fraud are forms of \u201cracketeering activity\u201d for\npurposes of RICO. \u00a71961(1)(B). Petitioners\u2019 conduct\nallegedly constituted a \u201cpattern of racketeering activity,\u201d\nsee \u00a71961(5) (2000 ed.), because the fraudulent returns\nwere submitted on an ongoing and regular basis.\n   Ideal asserts in its first cause of action that Joseph and\nVincent Anza violated \u00a71962(c), which makes it unlawful\nfor \u201cany person employed by or associated with any enter\nprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, inter\n                 Cite as: 547 U.

It alleges a violation of \u00a71962(a), which makes\nit unlawful for any person who has received income de\nrived from a pattern of racketeering activity \u201cto use or\ninvest\u201d that income \u201cin acquisition of any interest in, or\nthe establishment or operation of,\u201d an enterprise engaged\nin or affecting interstate or foreign commerce. As de\nscribed in the complaint, petitioners used funds generated\nby their fraudulent tax scheme to open National\u2019s Bronx\nlocation. The opening of this new facility caused Ideal to\nlose \u201csignificant business and market share.\u201d App. 18.\n   Petitioners moved to dismiss Ideal\u2019s complaint under\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 9(b). The\nDistrict Court granted the Rule 12(b)(6) motion, holding\nthat the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief\ncould be granted. The court began from the proposition\nthat to assert a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud or\nwire fraud, a plaintiff must have relied on the defendant\u2019s\nmisrepresentations. Ideal not having alleged that it relied\non petitioners\u2019 false tax returns, the court concluded Ideal\ncould not go forward with its RICO claims.\n   Ideal appealed, and the Court of Appeals for the Second\nCircuit vacated the District Court\u2019s judgment. 373 F. 3d\n251 (2004). Addressing Ideal\u2019s \u00a71962(c) claim, the court\nheld that where a complaint alleges a pattern of racketeer\ning activity \u201cthat was intended to and did give the defen\ndant a competitive advantage over the plaintiff, the com\nplaint adequately pleads proximate cause, and the\nplaintiff has standing to pursue a civil RICO claim.\u201d Id.,\nat 263. This is the case, the court explained, \u201ceven where\n4            ANZA v. IDEAL STEEL SUPPLY CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe scheme depended on fraudulent communications\ndirected to and relied on by a third party rather than the\nplaintiff.\u201d Ibid.\n   The court reached the same conclusion with respect to\nIdeal\u2019s \u00a71962(a) claim. It reasoned that Ideal adequately\npleaded its claim because it alleged an injury by reason of\npetitioners\u2019 use and investment of racketeering proceeds,\n\u201cas distinct from injury traceable simply to the predicate\nacts of racketeering alone or to the conduct of the business\nof the enterprise.\u201d Id., at 264.\n   We granted certiorari. 546 U. S. __ (2005).\n                             II\n   Our analysis begins\u2014and, as will become evident,\nlargely ends\u2014with Holmes. That case arose from a com\nplaint filed by the Securities Investor Protection Corpora\ntion (SIPC), a private corporation with a duty to reimburse\nthe customers of registered broker-dealers who became\nunable to meet their financial obligations. SIPC claimed\nthat the petitioner, Robert Holmes, conspired with others\nto manipulate stock prices. When the market detected the\nfraud, the share prices plummeted, and the \u201cdecline\ncaused [two] broker-dealers\u2019 financial difficulties resulting\nin their eventual liquidation and SIPC\u2019s advance of nearly\n$13 million to cover their customers\u2019 claims.\u201d 503 U. S., at\n262\u2013263. SIPC sued on several theories, including that\nHolmes participated in the conduct of an enterprise\u2019s\naffairs through a pattern of racketeering activity in viola\ntion of \u00a71962(c) and conspired to do so in violation of\n\u00a71962(d).\n   The Court held that SIPC could not maintain its RICO\nclaims against Holmes for his alleged role in the scheme.\nThe decision relied on a careful interpretation of \u00a71964(c),\nwhich provides a civil cause of action to persons injured\n\u201cby reason of\u201d a defendant\u2019s RICO violation. The Court\nrecognized the phrase \u201cby reason of\u201d could be read broadly\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto require merely that the claimed violation was a \u201cbut\nfor\u201d cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury. Id., at 265\u2013266. It\nrejected this reading, however, noting the \u201cunlikelihood\nthat Congress meant to allow all factually injured plain\ntiffs to recover.\u201d Id., at 266.\n   Proper interpretation of \u00a71964(c) required consideration\nof the statutory history, which revealed that \u201cCongress\nmodeled \u00a71964(c) on the civil-action provision of the fed\neral antitrust laws, \u00a74 of the Clayton Act.\u201d Id., at 267. In\nAssociated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459\nU. S. 519 (1983), the Court held that \u201ca plaintiff\u2019s right to\nsue under \u00a74 required a showing that the defendant\u2019s\nviolation not only was a \u2018but for\u2019 cause of his injury, but\nwas the proximate cause as well.\u201d Holmes, supra, at 268\n(citing Associated Gen. Contractors, supra, at 534). This\nreasoning, the Court noted in Holmes, \u201capplies just as\nreadily to \u00a71964(c).\u201d 503 U. S., at 268.\n   The Holmes Court turned to the common-law founda\ntions of the proximate-cause requirement, and specifically\nthe \u201cdemand for some direct relation between the injury\nasserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d Ibid. It\nconcluded that even if SIPC were subrogated to the rights\nof certain aggrieved customers, the RICO claims could not\nsatisfy this requirement of directness. The deficiency, the\nCourt explained, was that \u201cthe link is too remote between\nthe stock manipulation alleged and the customers\u2019 harm,\nbeing purely contingent on the harm suffered by the bro\nker-dealers.\u201d Id., at 271.\n   Applying the principles of Holmes to the present case,\nwe conclude Ideal cannot maintain its claim based on\n\u00a71962(c). Section 1962(c), as noted above, forbids conduct\ning or participating in the conduct of an enterprise\u2019s af\nfairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. The Court\nhas indicated the compensable injury flowing from a viola\ntion of that provision \u201cnecessarily is the harm caused by\npredicate acts sufficiently related to constitute a pattern,\n6           ANZA v. IDEAL STEEL SUPPLY CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfor the essence of the violation is the commission of those\nacts in connection with the conduct of an enterprise.\u201d\nSedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U. S. 479, 497 (1985).\n   Ideal\u2019s theory is that Joseph and Vincent Anza harmed\nit by defrauding the New York tax authority and using the\nproceeds from the fraud to offer lower prices designed to\nattract more customers. The RICO violation alleged by\nIdeal is that the Anzas conducted National\u2019s affairs\nthrough a pattern of mail fraud and wire fraud. The direct\nvictim of this conduct was the State of New York, not\nIdeal. It was the State that was being defrauded and the\nState that lost tax revenue as a result.\n   The proper referent of the proximate-cause analysis is\nan alleged practice of conducting National\u2019s business\nthrough a pattern of defrauding the State. To be sure,\nIdeal asserts it suffered its own harms when the Anzas\nfailed to charge customers for the applicable sales tax.\nThe cause of Ideal\u2019s asserted harms, however, is a set of\nactions (offering lower prices) entirely distinct from the\nalleged RICO violation (defrauding the State). The at\ntenuation between the plaintiff\u2019s harms and the claimed\nRICO violation arises from a different source in this case\nthan in Holmes, where the alleged violations were linked\nto the asserted harms only through the broker-dealers\u2019\ninability to meet their financial obligations. Nevertheless,\nthe absence of proximate causation is equally clear in both\ncases.\n   This conclusion is confirmed by considering the direct\nness requirement\u2019s underlying premises. See 503 U. S., at\n269\u2013270. One motivating principle is the difficulty that\ncan arise when a court attempts to ascertain the damages\ncaused by some remote action. See id., at 269 (\u201c[T]he less\ndirect an injury is, the more difficult it becomes to ascer\ntain the amount of a plaintiff\u2019s damages attributable to\nthe violation, as distinct from other, independent, fac\ntors\u201d). The instant case is illustrative. The injury Ideal\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nalleges is its own loss of sales resulting from National\u2019s\ndecreased prices for cash-paying customers. National,\nhowever, could have lowered its prices for any number of\nreasons unconnected to the asserted pattern of fraud. It\nmay have received a cash inflow from some other source or\nconcluded that the additional sales would justify a smaller\nprofit margin. Its lowering of prices in no sense required\nit to defraud the state tax authority. Likewise, the fact\nthat a company commits tax fraud does not mean the\ncompany will lower its prices; the additional cash could go\nanywhere from asset acquisition to research and develop\nment to dividend payouts. Cf. id., at 271 (\u201cThe broker-\ndealers simply cannot pay their bills, and only that inter\nvening insolvency connects the conspirators\u2019 acts to the\nlosses suffered by the nonpurchasing customers and gen\neral creditors\u201d).\n   There is, in addition, a second discontinuity between the\nRICO violation and the asserted injury. Ideal\u2019s lost sales\ncould have resulted from factors other than petitioners\u2019\nalleged acts of fraud. Businesses lose and gain customers\nfor many reasons, and it would require a complex assess\nment to establish what portion of Ideal\u2019s lost sales were\nthe product of National\u2019s decreased prices. Cf. id., at 272\u2013\n273 (\u201cIf the nonpurchasing customers were allowed to sue,\nthe district court would first need to determine the extent\nto which their inability to collect from the broker-dealers\nwas the result of the alleged conspiracy to manipulate, as\nopposed to, say, the broker-dealers\u2019 poor business practices\nor their failures to anticipate developments in the finan\ncial markets\u201d).\n   The attenuated connection between Ideal\u2019s injury and\nthe Anzas\u2019 injurious conduct thus implicates fundamental\nconcerns expressed in Holmes. Notwithstanding the lack\nof any appreciable risk of duplicative recoveries, which is\nanother consideration relevant to the proximate-cause\ninquiry, see id., at 269, these concerns help to illustrate\n8           ANZA v. IDEAL STEEL SUPPLY CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhy Ideal\u2019s alleged injury was not the direct result of a\nRICO violation. Further illustrating this point is the\nspeculative nature of the proceedings that would follow if\nIdeal were permitted to maintain its claim. A court con\nsidering the claim would need to begin by calculating the\nportion of National\u2019s price drop attributable to the alleged\npattern of racketeering activity. It next would have to\ncalculate the portion of Ideal\u2019s lost sales attributable to\nthe relevant part of the price drop. The element of proxi\nmate causation recognized in Holmes is meant to prevent\nthese types of intricate, uncertain inquiries from overrun\nning RICO litigation. It has particular resonance when\napplied to claims brought by economic competitors, which,\nif left unchecked, could blur the line between RICO and\nthe antitrust laws.\n   The requirement of a direct causal connection is espe\ncially warranted where the immediate victims of an al\nleged RICO violation can be expected to vindicate the laws\nby pursuing their own claims. See id., at 269\u2013270\n(\u201c[D]irectly injured victims can generally be counted on to\nvindicate the law as private attorneys general, without\nany of the problems attendant upon suits by plaintiffs\ninjured more remotely\u201d). Again, the instant case is in\nstructive. Ideal accuses the Anzas of defrauding the State\nof New York out of a substantial amount of money. If the\nallegations are true, the State can be expected to pursue\nappropriate remedies. The adjudication of the State\u2019s\nclaims, moreover, would be relatively straightforward;\nwhile it may be difficult to determine facts such as the\nnumber of sales Ideal lost due to National\u2019s tax practices,\nit is considerably easier to make the initial calculation of\nhow much tax revenue the Anzas withheld from the State.\nThere is no need to broaden the universe of actionable\nharms to permit RICO suits by parties who have been\ninjured only indirectly.\n   The Court of Appeals reached a contrary conclusion,\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\napparently reasoning that because the Anzas allegedly\nsought to gain a competitive advantage over Ideal, it is\nimmaterial whether they took an indirect route to accom\nplish their goal. See 373 F. 3d, at 263. This rationale does\nnot accord with Holmes. A RICO plaintiff cannot circum\nvent the proximate-cause requirement simply by claiming\nthat the defendant\u2019s aim was to increase market share at\na competitor\u2019s expense. See Associated Gen. Contractors,\n459 U. S., at 537 (\u201cWe are also satisfied that an allegation\nof improper motive . . . is not a panacea that will enable\nany complaint to withstand a motion to dismiss\u201d). When a\ncourt evaluates a RICO claim for proximate causation, the\ncentral question it must ask is whether the alleged viola\ntion led directly to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. In the instant\ncase, the answer is no. We hold that Ideal\u2019s \u00a71962(c) claim\ndoes not satisfy the requirement of proximate causation.\n   Petitioners alternatively ask us to hold, in line with the\nDistrict Court\u2019s decision granting petitioners\u2019 motion to\ndismiss, that a plaintiff may not assert a RICO claim\npredicated on mail fraud or wire fraud unless it demon\nstrates it relied on the defendant\u2019s misrepresentations.\nThey argue that RICO\u2019s private right of action must be\ninterpreted in light of common-law principles, and that at\ncommon law a fraud action requires the plaintiff to prove\nreliance. Because Ideal has not satisfied the proximate-\ncause requirement articulated in Holmes, we have no\noccasion to address the substantial question whether a\nshowing of reliance is required. Cf. 503 U. S., at 275\u2013276.\n                            III\n   The amended complaint also asserts a RICO claim\nbased on a violation of \u00a71962(a). The claim alleges peti\ntioners\u2019 tax scheme provided them with funds to open a\nnew store in the Bronx, which attracted customers who\notherwise would have purchased from Ideal.\n   In this Court petitioners contend that the proximate\n10           ANZA v. IDEAL STEEL SUPPLY CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncause analysis should function identically for purposes of\nIdeal\u2019s \u00a71962(c) claim and its \u00a71962(a) claim. (Petitioners\nalso contend that \u201ca civil RICO plaintiff does not plead an\ninjury proximately caused by a violation of \u00a71962(a)\nmerely by alleging that a corporate defendant reinvested\nprofits back into itself,\u201d Brief for Petitioners 20, n. 5, but\nthis argument has not been developed, and we decline to\naddress it.) It is true that private actions for violations of\n\u00a71962(a), like actions for violations of \u00a71962(c), must be\nasserted under \u00a71964(c). It likewise is true that a claim is\ncognizable under \u00a71964(c) only if the defendant\u2019s alleged\nviolation proximately caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury. The\nproximate-cause inquiry, however, requires careful con\nsideration of the \u201crelation between the injury asserted and\nthe injurious conduct alleged.\u201d Holmes, supra, at 268.\nBecause \u00a71962(c) and \u00a71962(a) set forth distinct prohibi\ntions, it is at least debatable whether Ideal\u2019s two claims\nshould be analyzed in an identical fashion for proximate-\ncause purposes.\n   The Court of Appeals held that Ideal adequately pleaded\nits \u00a71962(a) claim, see 373 F. 3d, at 264, but the court did\nnot address proximate causation. We decline to consider\nIdeal\u2019s \u00a71962(a) claim without the benefit of the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 analysis, particularly given that the parties have\ndevoted nearly all their attention in this Court to the\n\u00a71962(c) claim. We therefore vacate the Court of Appeals\u2019\njudgment with respect to Ideal\u2019s \u00a71962(a) claim. On re\nmand, the court should determine whether petitioners\u2019\nalleged violation of \u00a71962(a) proximately caused the inju\nries Ideal asserts.\n                       *     *    *\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed in part\nand vacated in part. The case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 547 U.

S. C. \u00a71961 et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. III), by adopt\ning a theory of proximate causation that is supported\nneither by the Act nor by our decision in Holmes v. Securi\nties Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 268\n(1992), on which the Court principally relies. The Court\u2019s\nstringent proximate-causation requirement succeeds in\nprecluding recovery in cases alleging a violation of\n\u00a71962(c) that, like the present one, have nothing to do\nwith organized crime, the target of the RICO statute.\nHowever, the Court\u2019s approach also eliminates recovery\nfor plaintiffs whose injuries are precisely those that Con\ngress aimed to remedy through the authorization of civil\nRICO suits. Because this frustration of congressional\nintent is directly contrary to the broad language Congress\nemployed to confer a RICO cause of action, I respectfully\ndissent from Part II of the Court\u2019s opinion.\n                             I\n  The language of the civil RICO provision, which broadly\npermits recovery by \u201c[a]ny person injured in his business\n2               ANZA v.

In Holmes, however, we held that a RICO plaintiff\nis required to show that the RICO violation \u201cnot only was\na \u2018but for\u2019 cause of his injury, but was the proximate cause\nas well.\u201d 503 U. S., at 268. We employed the term \u201c \u2018proxi\nmate cause\u2019 to label generically the judicial tools used to\nlimit a person\u2019s responsibility for the consequences of that\nperson\u2019s own acts.\u201d Ibid. These tools reflect \u201c \u2018ideas of\nwhat justice demands, or of what is administratively\npossible and convenient.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting W. Keeton, D.\nDobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law\nof Torts \u00a741, p. 264 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser &\nKeeton)).\n   Invoking one of the common-law proximate-cause con\nsiderations, we held that a RICO plaintiff must prove\n\u201csome direct relation between the injury asserted and the\ninjurious conduct alleged.\u201d 503 U. S., at 268. Today the\nCourt applies this formulation of proximate causation to\nconclude that the \u201cattenuated and uncertain relationship\u201d\nbetween the violation of \u00a71962(c) and Ideal\u2019s injury \u201ccan\nnot, consistent with Holmes\u2019 demand for directness, sus\ntain Ideal\u2019s claim.\u201d Ante, at 6.

In light of the Court\u2019s disposition of the \u00a71962(c)\nclaim and the limited discussion of \u00a71962(a) by the parties, I agree with\nthe Court that we should give the Court of Appeals the first opportu\nnity to reconsider the \u00a71962(a) claim. Accordingly, I join Part III of the\nCourt\u2019s opinion.\n                     Cite as: 547 U.

S., at 268\u2013269. The plaintiff in Holmes was\nindirect in precisely this sense. The defendant was alleged\nto have participated in a stock manipulation scheme that\ndisabled two broker-dealers from meeting their obligations\nto customers. Accordingly, the plaintiff, Securities Inves\ntor Protection Corporation (SIPC), had to advance nearly\n$13 million to cover the claims of customers of those bro\nker-dealers. SIPC attempted to sue based on the claim\nthat it was subrogated to the rights of those customers of\nthe broker-dealers who did not purchase manipulated\nsecurities. We held that the nonpurchasing customers\u2019\ninjury was not proximately caused by the defendant\u2019s\nconduct, because \u201cthe conspirators have allegedly injured\nthese customers only insofar as the stock manipulation\nfirst injured the broker-dealers and left them without the\nwherewithal to pay customers\u2019 claims.\u201d Id., at 271.2\n   Here, in contrast, it was not New York\u2019s injury that\ncaused respondent\u2019s damages; rather, it was petitioners\u2019\nown conduct\u2014namely, their underpayment of tax\u2014that\npermitted them to undercut respondent\u2019s prices and\nthereby take away its business. Indeed, the Court\u2019s ac\nknowledgment that there is no appreciable risk of duplica\ntive recovery here, in contrast to Holmes, ante, at 7, is\neffectively a concession that petitioners\u2019 damages are not\nindirect, as that term is used in Holmes. See 503 U. S., at\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Sutherland\u2019s   treatise on damages, on which the Court relied in\nHolmes, labels the same type of claims indirect: those where one party\nis injured, and it is that very injury\u2014and not the wrongful behavior by\nthe tortfeasor\u2014that causes the injury to the plaintiff. See 1 J. Suther\nland, Law of Damages 55 (1882) (hereinafter Sutherland). Indeed,\nevery example cited in Sutherland in illustration of this principle\nparallels Holmes; the plaintiff would not be injured absent the injury to\nanother victim. See Sutherland 55\u201356.\n4            ANZA v. IDEAL STEEL SUPPLY CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n269 (\u201c[R]ecognizing claims of the indirectly injured would\nforce courts to adopt complicated rules apportioning dam\nages among plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury\nfrom the violative acts, to obviate the risk of multiple\nrecoveries\u201d). The mere fact that New York is a direct\nvictim of petitioners\u2019 RICO violation does not preclude\nIdeal\u2019s claim that it too is a direct victim. Because the\npetitioners\u2019 tax underpayment directly caused respon\ndent\u2019s injury, Holmes does not bar respondent\u2019s recovery.\n   The Court nonetheless contends that respondent has\nfailed to demonstrate proximate cause. It does so by\nrelying on our observation in Holmes that the directness\nrequirement is appropriate because \u201c \u2018[t]he less direct an\ninjury is, the more difficult it becomes to ascertain the\namount of a plaintiff\u2019s damages attributable to the viola\ntion, as distinct from other, independent, factors.\u2019 \u201d Ante,\nat 6 (quoting Holmes, supra, at 269, in turn, citing Associ\nated Gen.

In Holmes, we noted that it would be hard for\nthe District Court to determine how much of the broker-\ndealers\u2019 failure to pay their customers was due to the\nfraud and how much was due to other factors affecting the\nbroker-dealers\u2019 business success. 503 U.

Holmes\nand Associated General Contractors simply held that one\nreason that indirect injuries should not be compensable is\nthat such injuries are difficult to ascertain. Holmes, su\npra, at 269; Associated General Contractors, supra, at 542.\nWe did not adopt the converse proposition that any inju\nries that are difficult to ascertain must be classified as\n                     Cite as: 547 U.

That is, to recover, a plaintiff must show both\nthat his injury is sufficiently connected to the tort that\n\u201cthe moral judgment and practical sense of mankind [will]\nrecognize responsibility in the domain of morals,\u201d Suther\nland 18, and that the specific pecuniary advantages, the\nloss of which is alleged as damages, \u201cwould have resulted,\nand, therefore, that the act complained of prevented\nthem,\u201d id., at 106\u2013107. Holmes and Associated General\nContractors dealt primarily with the former showing. The\nCourt\u2019s discussion of the Union\u2019s \u201chighly speculative\u201d\ndamages in Associated General Contractors focused not on\nthe difficulty of proving the precise amount of damages,\nbut with \u201cthe tenuous and speculative character of the\nrelationship between the alleged antitrust violation and\nthe Union\u2019s alleged injury.\u201d 459 U.

Here, the\nrelationship between the alleged RICO violation and the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Indeed, in Associated General Contractors, we did not even squarely\nhold that the reason that indirect damages are not compensable was\nthat the damages were not easily ascertainable; instead, we merely\nrecognized the empirical fact that \u201c[p]artly because it is indirect, and\npartly because the alleged effects on the Union may have been pro\nduced by independent factors, the Union\u2019s damages claim is also highly\nspeculative.\u201d 459 U. S., at 542.\n   4 Sutherland described the interrelation between the two concepts:\n\n\u201cA fatal uncertainty may infect a case where an injury is easily prov\nable, but the alleged responsible cause cannot be sufficiently estab\nlished as to the whole or some part of that injury. So it may exist\nwhere a known and provable wrong or violation of contract appears, but\nthe alleged loss or injury as a result of it cannot be certainly shown.\u201d\nSutherland 94.\n6               ANZA v.

The question with which\nthe Court expresses concern\u2014whether Ideal can prove the\namount of its actual damages \u201cwith sufficient certainty,\u201d\nSutherland 106, to permit recovery\u2014is simply not before\nthe Court.\n  It is nonetheless worth noting that the Court overstates\nthe difficulties of proof faced by respondent in this case.\nCertainly the plaintiff in this case, as in all tort cases\ninvolving damage to business, must demonstrate that he\nsuffered a harm caused by the tort, and not merely by\nexternal market conditions. See generally Prosser &\nKeeton \u00a7130, at 1014\u20131015, and nn. 92\u201399 (gathering\ncases authorizing liability for torts that \u201cdepriv[e] the\nplaintiff of customers or other prospects\u201d); cf.

Ideal\u2019s complaint\nalleges that petitioners \u201cpass on to National\u2019s customers the sales tax\n\u2018savings\u2019 that National realizes as a result of its false returns.\u201d App. 16.\nThis allegation that, as a factual matter, National was able to charge a\nlower price after tax because of its fraud suffices to permit Ideal to\nsurvive a motion to dismiss on the question whether the prices were\nlowered due to the fraud, as opposed to other factors.\n                  Cite as: 547 U.

Had National actually done\nso, it might be difficult to ascertain the damages suffered\nby Ideal as a result of that investment. But the mere fact\nthat National could have committed tax fraud without\nreadily ascertainable injury to Ideal does not mean that its\ntax fraud necessarily caused no readily ascertainable\ninjury in this case. Likewise, the Court is undoubtedly\ncorrect that \u201cIdeal\u2019s lost sales could have resulted from\nfactors other than petitioners\u2019 alleged tax frauds.\u201d Ibid.\nHowever, the means through which the fraudulent scheme\nwas carried out\u2014with sales tax charged on noncash sales,\nbut no tax charged on cash sales\u2014renders the damages\nmore ascertainable than in the typical case of lost busi\nness. In any event, it is well within the expertise of a\ndistrict court to evaluate testimony and evidence and\ndetermine what portion of Ideal\u2019s lost sales are attribut\nable to National\u2019s lower prices and what portion to other\nfactors.\n   The Court also relies on an additional reason Holmes\ngave for limiting recovery to direct victims\u2014namely, that\n\u201c[t]he requirement of a direct causal connection is espe\ncially warranted where the immediate victims of an al\nleged RICO violation can be expected to vindicate the laws\nby pursuing their own claims.\u201d Ante, at 8 (citing Holmes,\n503 U. S., at 269\u2013270). Certainly, New York can sue here\nand vindicate the law, rendering respondent\u2019s enforcement\nof the law less necessary than it would be if respondent\nwere the only direct victim of the illegal activity. But our\nrecognition in Holmes that limiting recovery to direct\nvictims would not undermine deterrence does not support\nthe conclusion that any victim whose lawsuit is unneces\nsary for deterrence is an indirect victim. Indeed, in any\ntort case with multiple possible plaintiffs, a single plain\ntiff\u2019s lawsuit could suffice to vindicate the law. If multiple\nplaintiffs are direct victims of a tort, it would be unjust to\n8             ANZA v. IDEAL STEEL SUPPLY CORP.\n\n                        Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\ndeclare some of their lawsuits unnecessary for deterrence,\nabsent any basis for doing so in the relevant statute.\nBecause respondent\u2019s injuries result from petitioners\u2019\nfraud, and not from New York\u2019s injuries, respondent has a\nright to recover equal to that of New York.\n   Application of common-law principles of proximate\ncausation beyond the directness requirement likewise\nsupports a finding that causation was sufficiently pleaded\nin this case. Though the Holmes Court noted that direct\nness was \u201cone of [the] central elements\u201d it had considered\nin evaluating causation, it recognized that proximate\ncausation took \u201cmany shapes\u201d at common law. Id., at 268.\nCf. Prosser & Keeton \u00a742, at 273 (noting \u201ctwo contrasting\ntheories of legal cause,\u201d one extending liability to, but not\nbeyond, \u201cthe scope of the \u2018foreseeable risks,\u2019 \u201d and the other\nextending liability to, but not beyond, all \u201c \u2018directly trace\nable\u2019 \u201d consequences and those indirect consequences that\nare foreseeable).6 The proximate-cause limitation serves\nto ensure that \u201ca defendant is not answerable for anything\nbeyond the natural, ordinary and reasonable consequences\nof his conduct.\u201d Sutherland 57. \u201cIf one\u2019s fault happens to\nconcur with something extraordinary, and therefore not\nlikely to be foreseen, he will not be answerable for such\nunexpected result.\u201d Ibid. Based on this principle, courts\nhave historically found proximate causation for injuries\nfrom natural causes, if a wrongful act \u201crendered it prob\nable that such an injury will occur,\u201d id., at 62; for injuries\nwhere the plaintiff\u2019s reliance is the immediate cause, such\nas in an action for fraud, so long as the reliance was \u201crea\nsonably induced by the prior misconduct of the defendant,\u201d\nid., at 62\u201363; and for injuries where an innocent third\nparty intervenes between the tortfeasor and the victim,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Prosser and Keeton appear to use \u201cdirect\u201d in a broader sense than\n\nthat adopted by the Court in Holmes.

Fleet Bank, N. A., 318 F. 3d\n113, 124 (CA2 2003)), outlined a proximate-causation\nstandard that falls well in line both with the reasoning\nbehind having a proximate-cause requirement at all, and\nwith the traditional applications of this standard to tort\nfeasors who caused injury only through a two-step process.\nThe Court, in contrast, permits a defendant to evade\nliability for harms that are not only foreseeable, but the\nintended consequences of the defendant\u2019s unlawful behav\nior. A defendant may do so simply by concocting a scheme\nunder which a further, lawful and intentional step by the\ndefendant is required to inflict the injury. Such a rule\nprecludes recovery for injuries for which the defendant is\nplainly morally responsible and which are suffered by\neasily identifiable plaintiffs. There is no basis in the\nRICO statute, in common-law tort, or in Holmes for reach\ning this result.\n                             II\n   Because neither the plain language of the civil RICO\nprovision nor our precedent supports the Court\u2019s holding,\nit must be rejected. It is worth noting, however, that\nwhile the Court\u2019s holding in the present case may prevent\nlitigation in an area far removed from the concerns about\norganized crime that led to RICO\u2019s enactment, that hold\ning also precludes civil recovery for losses sustained by\nbusiness competitors as a result of quintessential organ\nized criminal activity, cases Congress indisputably in\n10             ANZA v.

See H. J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell\nTelephone Co., 492 U. S. 229, 245 (1989). There is some\nevidence, to be sure, that the drafters knew that RICO\nwould have the potential to sweep more broadly than\norganized crime and did not find that problematic. Id., at\n246\u2013248.

Indeed, proposals for cur\ntailing civil RICO have been introduced in Congress; for\nexample, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act,\nenacted in 1995, removed securities fraud as a predicate\nact under RICO.

Given the distance the facts of this\ncase lie from the prototypical organized criminal activity\nthat led to RICO\u2019s enactment, it is tempting to find in the\nAct a limitation that will keep at least this and similar\ncases out of court.\n  The Court\u2019s attempt to exclude this case from the reach\nof civil RICO, however, succeeds in eliminating not only\ncases that lie far outside the harm RICO was intended to\ncorrect, but also those that were at the core of Congress\u2019\nconcern in enacting the statute. The Court unanimously\nrecognized in Sedima that one reason\u2014and, for the dis\nsent, the principal reason\u2014Congress enacted RICO was to\nprotect businesses against competitive injury from organ\nized crime.

The report noted that \u201c[t]he millions of\ndollars [organized crime] can throw into the legitimate\neconomic system gives it power to manipulate the price of\nshares on the stock market, to raise or lower the price of\nretail merchandise, to determine whether entire indus\ntries are union or nonunion, to make it easier or harder for\nbusinessmen to continue in business.\u201d Ibid.\n   It is not difficult to imagine a competitive injury to a\nbusiness that would result from the kind of organized\ncrime that Sedima, Congress, and the Commission all\nrecognized as the principal concern of RICO, yet that\nwould fail the Court\u2019s restrictive proximate-cause test.\nFor example, an organized crime group, running a legiti\nmate business, could, through threats of violence, per\nsuade its supplier to sell goods to it at cost, so that it could\nresell those goods at a lower price to drive its competitor\nout of the business. Honest businessmen would be unable\nto compete, as they do not engage in threats of violence to\nlower their costs. Civil RICO, if it was intended to do\nanything at all, was intended to give those businessmen a\ncause of action. Cf. Sedima, 473 U. S., at 521\u2013522 (Mar\nshall, J., dissenting). Yet just like respondent, those\nbusinessmen would not themselves be the immediate\ntarget of the threats; the target would be the supplier.\nLike respondent\u2019s injury, their injury would be most im\nmediately caused by the lawful activity of price competi\ntion, not the unlawful activity of threatening the supplier.\nAccordingly, under the Court\u2019s view, the honest business\n14             ANZA v. IDEAL STEEL SUPPLY CORP.\n\n                        Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nman competitor would be just an \u201cindirect\u201d victim, whose\ninjury was not proximately caused by the RICO violation.8\nCivil RICO would thus confer no right to sue on the indi\nvidual who did not himself suffer the threats of violence,\neven if the threats caused him harm.\n  As a result, after today, civil RICO plaintiffs that suffer\nprecisely the kind of injury that motivated the adoption of\nthe civil RICO provision will be unable to obtain relief. If\nthis result was compelled by the text of the statute, the\ninterference with congressional intent would be unavoid\nable. Given that the language is not even fairly suscepti\nble of such a reading, however, I cannot agree with this\nfrustration of congressional intent.\n                              III\n  Because I conclude that Ideal has sufficiently pleaded\nproximate cause, I must proceed to the question which the\nCourt does not reach: whether reliance is a required ele\nment of a RICO claim predicated on mail or wire fraud\nand, if it is, whether that reliance must be by the plaintiff.\nThe Court of Appeals held that reliance is required, but\nthat \u201ca RICO claim based on mail fraud may be proven\nwhere the misrepresentations were relied on by a third\nperson, rather than by the plaintiff.\u201d 373 F. 3d, at 262\u2013\n263. I disagree with the conclusion that reliance is re\nquired at all. In my view, the mere fact that the predicate\nacts underlying a particular RICO violation happen to be\nfraud offenses does not mean that reliance, an element of\ncommon-law fraud, is also incorporated as an element of a\ncivil RICO claim.\n  Petitioners are correct that the common law generally\nrequired a showing of justifiable reliance before a plaintiff\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The honest businessman would likewise fail JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s theory\nof proximate causation, because laws against threats of violence are\nintended to protect those who are so threatened, not other parties that\nmight suffer as a consequence.

We have specifically noted that \u201c[b]y prohibiting\nthe \u2018scheme to defraud,\u2019 rather than the completed fraud,\nthe element of reliance . . . would clearly be inconsistent\nwith the statutes Congress enacted.\u201d Id., at 25.\n   Because an individual can commit an indictable act of\nmail or wire fraud even if no one relies on his fraud, he\ncan engage in a pattern of racketeering activity, in viola\ntion of \u00a71962, without proof of reliance. Accordingly, it\ncannot be disputed that the Government could prosecute a\nperson for such behavior. The terms of \u00a71964(c) (2000 ed.),\nwhich broadly authorize suit by \u201c[a]ny person injured in\nhis business or property by reason of a violation of section\n1962,\u201d permit no different conclusion when an individual\nbrings a civil action against such a RICO violator.\n   It is true that our decision in Holmes to apply the com\nmon-law proximate cause requirement was likewise not\ncompelled by the broad language of the statute. But our\ndecision in that case was justified by the \u201cvery unlikeli\nhood that Congress meant to allow all factually injured\n16           ANZA v. IDEAL STEEL SUPPLY CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nplaintiffs to recover.\u201d 503 U. S., at 266. This unlikelihood\nstems, in part, from the nature of proximate cause, which\nis \u201cnot only a general condition of civil liability at common\nlaw but is almost essential to shape and delimit a rational\nremedy.\u201d Systems Management, Inc. v. Loiselle, 303 F. 3d\n100, 104 (CA1 2002). We also decided Holmes in light of\nCongress\u2019 decision to use the same words to impose civil\nliability under RICO as it had in \u00a77 of the Sherman Act,\n26 Stat. 210, into which federal courts had implied a\nproximate-cause limitation. 503 U. S., at 268. Accord\ningly, it was fair to interpret the broad language \u201cby rea\nson of\u201d as meaning, in all civil RICO cases, that the viola\ntion must be both the cause-in-fact and the proximate\ncause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury.\n   Here, by contrast, the civil action provision cannot be\nread to always require that the plaintiff have relied on the\ndefendant\u2019s action. Reliance is not a general limitation on\ncivil recovery in tort; it \u201cis a specialized condition that\nhappens to have grown up with common law fraud.\u201d\nLoiselle, supra, at 104. For most of the predicate acts\nunderlying RICO violations, it cannot be argued that the\ncommon law, if it even recognized such acts as civilly\nactionable, required proof of reliance. See \u00a71961 (2000 ed.,\nSupp. III). In other words, there is no language in\n\u00a71964(c) that could fairly be read to add a reliance re\nquirement in fraud cases only. Nor is there any reason to\nbelieve that Congress would have defined \u201cracketeering\nactivity\u201d to include acts indictable under the mail and wire\nfraud statutes, if it intended fraud-related acts to be predi\ncate acts under RICO only when those acts would have\nbeen actionable under the common law.\n   Because reliance cannot be read into \u00a7\u00a71341 and 1343,\nnor into RICO itself, it is not an element of a civil RICO\nclaim. This is not to say that, in the general case, a plain\ntiff will not have to prove that someone relied on the\npredicate act of fraud as part of his case. If, for example,\n                 Cite as: 547 U.

Indeed, the petitioners recognize that \u201cin\nthe ordinary misrepresentation case, the reliance re\nquirement simply functions as a necessary prerequisite to\nestablishing the causation required by the language of\n\u00a71964(c).\u201d Brief for Petitioners 29. But the fact that proof\nof reliance is often used to prove an element of the plain\ntiff\u2019s cause of action, such as the element of causation,\ndoes not transform reliance itself into an element of the\ncause of action. See Loiselle, supra, at 104 (\u201cReliance is\ndoubtless the most obvious way in which fraud can cause\nharm, but it is not the only way\u201d). Because respondent\nneed not allege reliance at all, its complaint, which alleges\nthat New York relied on petitioners\u2019 misrepresentations,\nApp. 16, is more than sufficient.\n                         *     *    *\n   The Congress that enacted RICO may never have in\ntended to reach cases like the one before us, and may have\n\u201cfederalize[d] a great deal of state common law\u201d without\nany intention of \u201cproduc[ing] these far-reaching results.\u201d\nSedima, 473 U. S., at 506 (Marshall, J., dissenting). But\nthis Court has always refused to ignore the language of\nthe statute to limit it to \u201cthe archetypal, intimidating\nmobster,\u201d and has instead recognized that \u201c[i]t is not for\nthe judiciary to eliminate the private action in situations\nwhere Congress has provided it simply because plaintiffs\nare not taking advantage of it in its more difficult applica\ntions.\u201d Id., at 499\u2013500. Today, however, the Court not\nonly eliminates private RICO actions in some situations\nCongress may have inadvertently regulated, but it sub\nstantially limits the ability of civil RICO to reach even\nthose cases that motivated Congress\u2019 enactment of this\nprovision in the first place.

Its\nlanguage, however, extends its scope well beyond those\ncentral purposes. RICO begins by listing certain predicate\nacts, called \u201c \u2018racketeering activity,\u2019 \u201d which consist of other\ncrimes, ranging from criminal copyright activities, the\nfacilitation of gambling, and mail fraud to arson, kidnap\nping and murder. \u00a71961(1). It then defines a \u201c \u2018pattern of\nracketeering activity\u2019 \u201d to include engaging in \u201cat least\ntwo\u201d predicate acts in a 10-year period. \u00a71961(5) (2000\ned.).

And a person \u201cin\njured in his business or property by reason of a [RICO]\nviolation\u201d may seek treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees.\n\u00a71964(c).\n                              B\n  The present case is a private RICO treble-damages\naction. A steel supply company, Ideal Steel, has sued a\ncompeting steel supply company, National Steel, and its\nowners, Joseph and Vincent Anza (to whom I shall refer\ncollectively as \u201cNational\u201d). Ideal says that National com\nmitted mail fraud by regularly filing false New York state\nsales tax returns in order to avoid paying sales tax that it\nowed\u2014activity that amounts to a \u201cpattern of racketeering\nactivity.\u201d This activity enabled National to charge lower\nprices without reducing its profit margins. Ideal says\nNational used some of these excess profits to fund the\nbuilding of a new store. Both the lower prices and the new\noutlet attracted Ideal customers, thereby injuring Ideal.\nHence, says Ideal, it was injured \u201cin [its] business . . . by\nreason of\u201d violations of two RICO provisions, the provision\nthat forbids conducting an \u201centerprise\u2019s affairs\u201d through a\n\u201cpattern of racketeering activity\u201d and the provision that\nforbids investing funds derived from such a \u201cpattern\u201d in an\n\u201centerprise.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71962(c), (a). The question before us is\nwhether RICO permits Ideal to bring this private treble-\ndamages claim.\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)           3\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n                             II\n   This Court, in Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection\nCorporation, 503 U. S. 258, 268 (1992), held that RICO\u2019s\nprivate treble-damages provision \u201cdemand[ed] . . . some\ndirect relation between the injury asserted and the injuri\nous conduct alleged.\u201d The Court then determined that the\ninjury alleged by the plaintiff in that case was too remote\nfrom the injurious conduct to satisfy this requirement.\n   I do not agree with the majority insofar as it believes\nthat Holmes\u2019 holding in respect to the fact pattern there at\nissue virtually dictates the answer to the question here.\nIn my view, the \u201ccausal connection\u201d between the forbidden\nconduct and plaintiff\u2019s harm is, in certain key ways, more\ndirect here than it was in Holmes. In Holmes, the RICO\nplaintiff was a surrogate for creditors of broker-dealers\nthat went bankrupt after losing money in stocks that had\nbeen overvalued due to fraudulent statements made by\nthe RICO defendant and others. Put in terms of \u201cproxi\nmate cause,\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s harm (an ordinary creditor\nloss) differed in kind from the harm that the \u201cpredicate\nacts\u201d (securities fraud) would ordinarily cause (stock\nrelated monetary losses). The harm was \u201cindirect\u201d in the\nsense that it was entirely derivative of the more direct\nharm the defendant\u2019s actions had caused the broker-\ndealers; and, there were several steps between the viola\ntion and the harm (misrepresentation\u2014broker-dealer\nlosses\u2014broker-dealer business failure\u2014ordinary creditor\nloss). Here, however, the plaintiff alleges a harm (lost\ncustomers) that flows directly from the lower prices and\nthe opening of a new outlet\u2014actions that were themselves\nallegedly caused by activity that Congress designed RICO\nto forbid (conducting a business through a \u201cpattern\u201d of\n\u201cpredicate acts\u201d and investing in a business funds derived\nfrom such a \u201cpattern\u201d). In this sense, the causal links\nbefore us are more \u201cdirect\u201d than those in Holmes. See\nante, at 2\u20134 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissent\n4            ANZA v. IDEAL STEEL SUPPLY CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ning in part).\n   Nonetheless, I agree with the majority that Holmes\npoints the way. That case makes clear that RICO contains\nimportant limitations on the scope of private rights of\naction. It specifies that RICO does not provide a private\nright of action \u201csimply on showing that the defendant\nviolated \u00a71962, the plaintiff was injured, and the defen\ndant\u2019s violation was a \u2018but for\u2019 cause of the plaintiff\u2019s\ninjury.\u201d 503 U. S., at 265\u2013266 (footnote omitted). Pointing\nout \u201cthe very unlikelihood that Congress meant to allow\nall factually injured plaintiffs to recover,\u201d id., at 266 (em\nphasis added), Holmes concludes that RICO imposes a\nrequirement of \u201cproximate cause,\u201d a phrase that \u201clabel[s]\ngenerically the judicial tools used to limit a person\u2019s re\nsponsibility for the consequences of that person\u2019s own\nacts.\u201d Id., at 268. It recognizes that these tools seek to\ndiscern \u201c \u2018what justice demands, or . . . what is administra\ntively possible and convenient.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting W. Keeton,\nD. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on\nLaw of Torts \u00a741, p. 264 (5th ed. 1984)). It also explains\nthat \u201cproximate cause\u201d demands \u201cdirectness,\u201d while speci\nfying that \u201cdirectness\u201d is only one of \u201cthe many shapes this\nconcept took at common law.\u201d 503 U. S., at 268\u2013269. And\nit points to antitrust law, both as a source of RICO\u2019s\ntreble-damages provisions and as an aid to their interpre\ntation. Ibid.\n   In my view, the \u201cantitrust\u201d nature of the treble-damage\nprovision\u2019s source, taken together with both RICO\u2019s basic\nobjectives and important administrative concerns, implies\nthat a cause is \u201cindirect,\u201d i.e., it is not a \u201cproximate cause,\u201d\nif the causal chain from forbidden act to the injury caused\na competitor proceeds through a legitimate business\u2019s\nordinary competitive activity. To use a physical metaphor,\nordinary competitive actions undertaken by the defendant\ncompetitor cut the direct causal link between the plaintiff\ncompetitor\u2019s injuries and the forbidden acts.\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)            5\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n  The basic objective of antitrust law is to encourage the\ncompetitive process. In particular, that law encourages\nbusinesses to compete by offering lower prices, better\nproducts, better methods of production, and better systems\nof distribution. See, e.g., 1 P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp,\nAntitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and\nTheir Application \u00b6100a, pp. 3\u20134 (2d ed. 2000). As I shall\nexplain, these principles suggest that RICO does not\npermit private action based solely upon this competitive\ntype of harm, i.e., harm a plaintiff suffers only because the\ndefendant was able to attract customers through normal\ncompetitive methods, such as lower prices, better prod\nucts, better methods of production, or better systems of\ndistribution. In such cases, the harm falls outside the\nlimits that RICO\u2019s private treble-damages provision\u2019s\n\u201cproximate-cause\u201d requirement imposes. In such cases the\ndistance between the harm and the predicate acts that\nfunded (or otherwise enabled) such ordinary competitive\nactivity is too distant. The harm is not \u201cdirect.\u201d\n  At the same time, those principles suggest that other\ntypes of competitive injuries not within their protective\nambit could lie within, not outside, \u201cproximate-cause\u201d\nlimits. Where, for example, a RICO defendant attracts\ncustomers in ways that involve illegitimate competitive\nmeans, e.g., by threatening violence, a claim may still lie.\nClaims involving RICO violations that objectively target a\nparticular competitor, e.g., bribing an official to harass a\ncompetitor, could also be actionable.\n  Several considerations lead to this conclusion. First, I\nhave found no case (outside the Second Circuit, from\nwhich this case arose) in which a court has authorized a\nprivate treble-damages suit based upon no more than a\nlegitimate business\u2019s ordinary pro-competitive activity\n(even where financed by the proceeds of a RICO predicate\nact).\n  Second, an effort to bring harm caused by ordinary\n6           ANZA v. IDEAL STEEL SUPPLY CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ncompetitive activity within the scope of RICO\u2019s private\ntreble-damages action provision will raise serious prob\nlems of administrability. Ante, at 6\u20138 (majority opinion);\nsee also Holmes, supra, at 269. To demonstrate that a\ndefendant\u2019s lower price caused a plaintiff to lose customers\n(or profits) requires the plaintiff to show what would have\nhappened in its absence. Would customers have changed\nsuppliers irrespective of the price change because of other\ndifferences in the suppliers? Would other competing firms\nhave lowered their prices? Would higher prices have\nattracted new entry? Would demand for the industry\u2019s\nproduct, or the geographic scope of the relevant market,\nhave changed? If so, how? To answer such questions\nbased upon actual market circumstances and to apportion\ndamages among the various competitors harmed is diffi\ncult even for plaintiffs trying to trace harm caused by a\ndefendants\u2019 anti-competitive behavior. Associated Gen.\nContractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U. S. 519, 542,\n544 (1983) (the possibility that harm \u201cmay have been\nproduced by independent factors\u201d and \u201cthe danger of com\nplex apportionment of damages\u201d weigh against finding the\nrequisite causal connection in an antitrust case). To an\nswer such questions in the context of better functioning\nmarkets, where prices typically reflect competitive condi\ntions, would likely prove yet more difficult.\n   Third, where other victims, say victims of the underly\ning RICO \u201cpredicate acts\u201d are present, there is no pressing\nneed to provide such an action. Those alternative victims\n(here the State of New York) typically \u201ccould be counted\non to bring suit for the law\u2019s vindication.\u201d Holmes, supra,\nat 273. They could thus fulfill Congress\u2019 aim in adopting\nthe civil remedy of \u201cturn[ing victims] into prosecutors,\n\u2018private attorneys general,\u2019 dedicated to eliminating racket\neering activity.\u201d Rotella v. Wood, 528 U. S. 549, 557 (2000)\n(quoting Klehr v. A. O. Smith Corp., 521 U. S. 179, 187\n(1997)).\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n   Fourth, this approach to proximate cause would retain\nprivate actions aimed at the heart of Congress\u2019 relevant\nRICO concerns. RICO\u2019s sponsors, in reporting their under\nlying reasons for supporting RICO, emphasized, not the fair,\nordinary competition that an infiltrated business might offer\nits competitors, but the risk that such a business would act\ncorruptly, exercising unfair methods of competition. S. Rep.\nNo. 91\u2013617, pp. 76\u201378 (1969); see also Cedric Kushner\nPromotions, Ltd. v. King, 533 U. S. 158, 165 (2001). RICO\nfocuses upon the \u201cinfiltration of legitimate business by\norganized crime,\u201d in significant part because, when \u201c \u2018or\nganized crime moves into a business, it brings all the\ntechniques of violence and intimidation which it used in\nits illegal businesses.\u2019 \u201d Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co.,\n473 U. S. 479, 517, 515 (1985) (Marshall, J., dissenting)\n(quoting 113 Cong. Rec. 17999 (1967)).\n   My approach would not rule out private actions in such\ncases. Nor would it rule out three of the four suits men\ntioned by Justice Marshall, dissenting in Sedima, when he\ndescribes RICO\u2019s objectives. It would not rule out lawsuits\nby injured competitors or legitimate investors if a racket\neer, \u201cuses \u2018[t]hreats, arson and assault . . . to force com\npetitors out of business\u2019 \u201d; \u201cuses arson and threats to in\nduce honest businessmen to pay protection money, or to\npurchase certain goods, or to hire certain workers\u201d; or\n\u201cdisplace[s]\u201d an \u201chonest investor\u201d when he \u201cinfiltrates and\nobtains control of a legitimate business . . . through fraud\u201d\nor the like. 473 U. S., at 521\u2013522.\n   I concede that the approach would rule out a competi\ntor\u2019s lawsuit based on no more than an \u201cinfiltrated enter\nprise\u201d operating a legitimate business to a businessman\u2019s\ncompetitive disadvantage because unlawful predicate acts\nhelped that legitimate business build \u201ca strong economic\nbase.\u201d And I recognize that this latter kind of suit at least\narguably would have provided helpful deterrence had the\nview of Sedima\u2019s dissenting Justices prevailed. Id., at\n8            ANZA v. IDEAL STEEL SUPPLY CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n500\u2013523 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (arguing that RICO\u2019s\nprivate action provision did not authorize suits based on\nharm flowing directly from predicate acts); id., at 523\u2013530\n(Powell, J., dissenting) (same). But the dissent did not\nprevail, and the need for deterrence consequently offers\nonly weakened support for a reading of RICO that author\nizes private suits in this category.\n  Fifth, without this limitation, RICO enforcement and\nbasic antitrust policy could well collide. Firms losing the\ncompetitive battle might find bases for a RICO attack on\ntheir more successful competitors in claimed misrepresen\ntations or even comparatively minor misdeeds by that\ncompetitor. Firms that fear such treble-damages suits\nmight hesitate to compete vigorously, particularly in\nconcentrated industries where harm to a competitor is\nmore easily traced but where the consumer\u2019s need for\nvigorous competition is particularly strong. The ultimate\nvictim of any such tendency to pull ordinary competitive\npunches of course would be not the competing business,\nbut the consumer. Although Congress did not intend its\nRICO treble-damages provision as a simple copy of the\nantitrust laws\u2019 similar remedies, see, e.g., Sedima, supra,\nat 498\u2013499, there is no sound reason to interpret RICO\u2019s\ntreble-damages provision as if Congress intended to set it\nand its antitrust counterpart at cross-purposes.\n  For these reasons, I would read into the private treble-\ndamages provision a \u201cproximate-cause\u201d limitation that\nplaces outside the provision harms that are traceable to an\nunlawful act only through a form of legitimate competitive\nactivity.\n                              III\n  Applying this approach to the present case, I would hold\nthat neither of Ideal\u2019s counts states a RICO private treble-\ndamages claim. National is a legitimate business. An\nother private plaintiff (the State of New York) is available.\n                  Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)             9\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nThe question is whether Ideal asserts a harm caused\ndirectly by something other than ordinary competitive\nactivity, i.e., lower prices, a better product, a better distri\nbution system, or a better production method.\n   Ideal\u2019s second count claims injury caused by National\u2019s\n(1) having taken customers (2) attracted by its new store\n(3) that it financed in part through profits generated by\nthe tax fraud scheme, and the financing is the relevant\nviolation. \u00a71962(a). The opening of a distribution outlet is\na legitimate competitive activity. It benefits the firm that\nopens it by making it more convenient for customers to\npurchase from that supplier. That ordinary competitive\nprocess is all the complaint describes. And for the reasons\nI have given in Part II, supra, I believe that the financing\nof a new store\u2014even with funds generated by unlawful\nactivities\u2014is not sufficient to create a private cause of\naction as long as the activity funded amounts to legitimate\ncompetitive activity. Ideal must look for other remedies,\ne.g., bringing the facts to the attention of the United\nStates Attorney or the State of New York.\n   Ideal\u2019s first count presents a more difficult question. It\nalleges that National filed false sales tax returns to the\nState of New York. As an action indictable under the\nfederal mail fraud statute, that action is a predicate act\nunder RICO. See \u00a71961(1) (2000 ed., Supp. III). National\npassed these savings on to its cash customers by not\ncharging them sales tax, thereby attracting more cash\ncustomers than it would have without the scheme. Is this\na form of injury caused, not by ordinary competitive activ\nity, but simply by the predicate act itself?\n   In my view, the answer to this question is \u201cno.\u201d The\ncomplaint alleges predicate acts that amount simply to the\nfacts that National did not \u201ccharge\u201d or \u201cpay\u201d sales taxes or\naccurately \u201creport\u201d sales figures to the State. National did\nnot tell its customers, \u201cWe shall not pay sales taxes.\u201d\nRather, it simply charged the customer a lower price, say,\n10           ANZA v. IDEAL STEEL SUPPLY CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n$100 rather than $100 plus $8 tax. Consider a retailer\nwho advertises to the customer a $100 table and adds, \u201cWe\npay all sales taxes.\u201d Such a retailer is telling the customer\nthat he will charge the customer a lower price by the\namount of the tax, i.e., about $92. The retailer implies\nthat he, the retailer, will pay the tax to the State, taking\nthe requisite amount owed to the State from the $100 the\ncustomer paid for the item.\n  The defendants here have done no more. They have in\neffect cut the price of the item by the amount of the sales\ntax and then kept the money instead of passing it on to the\nState. They funded the price cut from the savings, but the\nsource of the savings is, in my view, beside the point as\nlong as the price cut itself is legitimate. I can find nothing\nin the complaint that suggests it is not.\n  For these reasons, I would reverse the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals on both counts.\n",

S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968 (2000 ed. and Supp. III), prohibits certain conduct involving a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\" \u00a7 1962 (2000 ed.). One of RICO's enforcement mechanisms is a private right of action, available to \"[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation\" of RICO's substantive restrictions. \u00a7 1964(c).</p>\n<p>In <i>Holmes</i> v. <i>Securities Investor Protection Corporation,</i> 503 U. S. 258, 268 (1992), this Court held that a plaintiff may sue under \u00a7 1964(c) only if the alleged RICO violation was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury. The instant case requires us to apply the principles discussed in <i>Holmes</i> to a dispute between two competing businesses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Because this case arises from a motion to dismiss, we accept as true the factual allegations in the amended complaint. See <i>Leatherman</i> v. <i>Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit,</i> 507 U. S. 163, 164 (1993).</p>\n<p>Respondent Ideal Steel Supply Corporation (Ideal) sells steel mill products along with related supplies and services. It operates two store locations in New York, one in Queens and the other in the Bronx. Petitioner National Steel Supply, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*454</span> Inc. (National), owned by petitioners Joseph and Vincent Anza, is Ideal's principal competitor. National offers a similar array of products and services, and it, too, operates one store in Queens and one in the Bronx.</p>\n<p>Ideal sued petitioners in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. It claimed petitioners were engaged in an unlawful racketeering scheme aimed at \"gain[ing] sales and market share at Ideal's expense.\" App. 7. According to Ideal, National adopted a practice of failing to charge the requisite New York sales tax to cashpaying customers, even when conducting transactions that were not exempt from sales tax under state law. This practice allowed National to reduce its prices without affecting its profit margin. Petitioners allegedly submitted fraudulent tax returns to the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance in an effort to conceal their conduct.</p>\n<p>Ideal's amended complaint contains, as relevant here, two RICO claims. The claims assert that petitioners, by submitting the fraudulent tax returns, committed various acts of mail fraud (when they sent the returns by mail) and wire fraud (when they sent them electronically). See 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341, 1343 (2000 ed., Supp. III). Mail fraud and wire fraud are forms of \"racketeering activity\" for purposes of RICO. \u00a7 1961(1)(B). Petitioners' conduct allegedly constituted a \"pattern of racketeering activity,\" see \u00a7 1961(5) (2000 ed.), because the fraudulent returns were submitted on an ongoing and regular basis.</p>\n<p>Ideal asserts in its first cause of action that Joseph and Vincent Anza violated \u00a7 1962(c), which makes it unlawful for \"any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.\" The complaint states that the Anzas' goal, which <span class=\"star-pagination\">*455</span> they achieved, was to give National a competitive advantage over Ideal.</p>\n<p>The second cause of action is asserted against all three petitioners. It alleges a violation of \u00a7 1962(a), which makes it unlawful for any person who has received income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity \"to use or invest\" that income \"in acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of,\" an enterprise engaged in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce. As described in the complaint, petitioners used funds generated by their fraudulent tax scheme to open National's Bronx location. The opening of this new facility caused Ideal to lose \"significant business and market share.\" App. 18.</p>\n<p>Petitioners moved to dismiss Ideal's complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 9(b). The District Court granted the Rule 12(b)(6) motion, holding that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court began from the proposition that to assert a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud or wire fraud, a plaintiff must have relied on the defendant's misrepresentations. Ideal not having alleged that it relied on petitioners' false tax returns, the court concluded Ideal could not go forward with its RICO claims.</p>\n<p>Ideal appealed, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the District Court's judgment. 373 F. 3d 251 (2004). Addressing Ideal's \u00a7 1962(c) claim, the court held that where a complaint alleges a pattern of racketeering activity \"that was intended to and did give the defendant a competitive advantage over the plaintiff, the complaint adequately pleads proximate cause, and the plaintiff has standing to pursue a civil RICO claim.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 263. This is the case, the court explained, \"even where the scheme depended on fraudulent communications directed to and relied on by a third party rather than the plaintiff.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The court reached the same conclusion with respect to Ideal's \u00a7 1962(a) claim. It reasoned that Ideal adequately <span class=\"star-pagination\">*456</span> pleaded its claim because it alleged an injury by reason of petitioners' use and investment of racketeering proceeds, \"as distinct from injury traceable simply to the predicate acts of racketeering alone or to the conduct of the business of the enterprise.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 264.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari. 546 U. S. 1029 (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Our analysis begins\u0097and, as will become evident, largely ends\u0097with <i>Holmes.</i> That case arose from a complaint filed by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), a private corporation with a duty to reimburse the customers of registered broker-dealers who became unable to meet their financial obligations. SIPC claimed that the petitioner, Robert Holmes, conspired with others to manipulate stock prices. When the market detected the fraud, the share prices plummeted, and the \"decline caused [two] broker-dealers' financial difficulties resulting in their eventual liquidation and SIPC's advance of nearly $13 million to cover their customers' claims.\" 503 U. S., at 262, 263. SIPC sued on several theories, including that Holmes participated in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity in violation of \u00a7 1962(c) and conspired to do so in violation of \u00a7 1962(d).</p>\n<p>The Court held that SIPC could not maintain its RICO claims against Holmes for his alleged role in the scheme. The decision relied on a careful interpretation of \u00a7 1964(c), which provides a civil cause of action to persons injured \"by reason of\" a defendant's RICO violation. The Court recognized the phrase \"by reason of\" could be read broadly to require merely that the claimed violation was a \"but for\" cause of the plaintiff's injury. <i>Id.,</i> at 265-266. It rejected this reading, however, noting the \"unlikelihood that Congress meant to allow all factually injured plaintiffs to recover.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 266.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*457</span> Proper interpretation of \u00a7 1964(c) required consideration of the statutory history, which revealed that \"Congress modeled \u00a7 1964(c) on the civil-action provision of the federal anti-trust laws, \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 267. In <i>Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc.</i> v. <i>Carpenters,</i> 459 U. S. 519 (1983), the Court held that \"a plaintiff's right to sue under \u00a7 4 required a showing that the defendant's violation not only was a `but for' cause of his injury, but was the proximate cause as well.\" <i>Holmes, supra,</i> at 268 (citing <i>Associated Gen. Contractors, supra,</i> at 534). This reasoning, the Court noted in <i>Holmes,</i> \"applies just as readily to \u00a7 1964(c).\" 503 U. S., at 268.</p>\n<p>The <i>Holmes</i> Court turned to the common-law foundations of the proximate-cause requirement, and specifically the \"demand for some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\" <i>Ibid.</i> It concluded that even if SIPC were subrogated to the rights of certain aggrieved customers, the RICO claims could not satisfy this requirement of directness. The deficiency, the Court explained, was that \"the link is too remote between the stock manipulation alleged and the customers' harm, being purely contingent on the harm suffered by the broker-dealers.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 271.</p>\n<p>Applying the principles of <i>Holmes</i> to the present case, we conclude Ideal cannot maintain its claim based on \u00a7 1962(c). Section 1962(c), as noted above, forbids conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. The Court has indicated the compensable injury flowing from a violation of that provision \"necessarily is the harm caused by predicate acts sufficiently related to constitute a pattern, for the essence of the violation is the commission of those acts in connection with the conduct of an enterprise.\" <i>Sedima, S. P. R. L.</i> v. <i>Imrex Co.,</i> 473 U. S. 479, 497 (1985).</p>\n<p>Ideal's theory is that Joseph and Vincent Anza harmed it by defrauding the New York tax authority and using the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*458</span> proceeds from the fraud to offer lower prices designed to attract more customers. The RICO violation alleged by Ideal is that the Anzas conducted National's affairs through a pattern of mail fraud and wire fraud. The direct victim of this conduct was the State of New York, not Ideal. It was the State that was being defrauded and the State that lost tax revenue as a result.</p>\n<p>The proper referent of the proximate-cause analysis is an alleged practice of conducting National's business through a pattern of defrauding the State. To be sure, Ideal asserts it suffered its own harms when the Anzas failed to charge customers for the applicable sales tax. The cause of Ideal's asserted harms, however, is a set of actions (offering lower prices) entirely distinct from the alleged RICO violation (defrauding the State). The attenuation between the plaintiff's harms and the claimed RICO violation arises from a different source in this case than in <i>Holmes,</i> where the alleged violations were linked to the asserted harms only through the broker-dealers' inability to meet their financial obligations. Nevertheless, the absence of proximate causation is equally clear in both cases.</p>\n<p>This conclusion is confirmed by considering the directness requirement's underlying premises. See 503 U. S., at 269-270. One motivating principle is the difficulty that can arise when a court attempts to ascertain the damages caused by some remote action. See <i>id.,</i> at 269 (\"[T]he less direct an injury is, the more difficult it becomes to ascertain the amount of a plaintiff's damages attributable to the violation, as distinct from other, independent, factors\"). The instant case is illustrative. The injury Ideal alleges is its own loss of sales resulting from National's decreased prices for cashpaying customers. National, however, could have lowered its prices for any number of reasons unconnected to the asserted pattern of fraud. It may have received a cash inflow from some other source or concluded that the additional sales would justify a smaller profit margin. Its lowering of prices <span class=\"star-pagination\">*459</span> in no sense required it to defraud the state tax authority. Likewise, the fact that a company commits tax fraud does not mean the company will lower its prices; the additional cash could go anywhere from asset acquisition to research and development to dividend payouts. Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 271 (\"The broker-dealers simply cannot pay their bills, and only that intervening insolvency connects the conspirators' acts to the losses suffered by the nonpurchasing customers and general creditors\").</p>\n<p>There is, in addition, a second discontinuity between the RICO violation and the asserted injury. Ideal's lost sales could have resulted from factors other than petitioners' alleged acts of fraud. Businesses lose and gain customers for many reasons, and it would require a complex assessment to establish what portion of Ideal's lost sales were the product of National's decreased prices. Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 272-273 (\"If the nonpurchasing customers were allowed to sue, the district court would first need to determine the extent to which their inability to collect from the broker-dealers was the result of the alleged conspiracy to manipulate, as opposed to, say, the broker-dealers' poor business practices or their failures to anticipate developments in the financial markets\").</p>\n<p>The attenuated connection between Ideal's injury and the Anzas' injurious conduct thus implicates fundamental concerns expressed in <i>Holmes.</i> Notwithstanding the lack of any appreciable risk of duplicative recoveries, which is another consideration relevant to the proximate-cause inquiry, see <i>id.,</i> at 269, these concerns help to illustrate why Ideal's alleged injury was not the direct result of a RICO violation. Further illustrating this point is the speculative nature of the proceedings that would follow if Ideal were permitted to maintain its claim. A court considering the claim would need to begin by calculating the portion of National's price drop attributable to the alleged pattern of racketeering activity. It next would have to calculate the portion of Ideal's lost sales attributable to the relevant part of the price drop. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*460</span> The element of proximate causation recognized in <i>Holmes</i> is meant to prevent these types of intricate, uncertain inquiries from overrunning RICO litigation. It has particular resonance when applied to claims brought by economic competitors, which, if left unchecked, could blur the line between RICO and the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p>The requirement of a direct causal connection is especially warranted where the immediate victims of an alleged RICO violation can be expected to vindicate the laws by pursuing their own claims. See <i>id.,</i> at 269-270 (\"[D]irectly injured victims can generally be counted on to vindicate the law as private attorneys general, without any of the problems attendant upon suits by plaintiffs injured more remotely\"). Again, the instant case is instructive. Ideal accuses the Anzas of defrauding the State of New York out of a substantial amount of money. If the allegations are true, the State can be expected to pursue appropriate remedies. The adjudication of the State's claims, moreover, would be relatively straightforward; while it may be difficult to determine facts such as the number of sales Ideal lost due to National's tax practices, it is considerably easier to make the initial calculation of how much tax revenue the Anzas withheld from the State. There is no need to broaden the universe of actionable harms to permit RICO suits by parties who have been injured only indirectly.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals reached a contrary conclusion, apparently reasoning that because the Anzas allegedly sought to gain a competitive advantage over Ideal, it is immaterial whether they took an indirect route to accomplish their goal. See 373 F. 3d, at 263. This rationale does not accord with <i>Holmes.</i> A RICO plaintiff cannot circumvent the proximate-cause requirement simply by claiming that the defendant's aim was to increase market share at a competitor's expense. See <i>Associated Gen. Contractors,</i> 459 U. S., at 537 (\"We are also satisfied that an allegation of improper motive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*461</span>. . . is not a panacea that will enable any complaint to withstand a motion to dismiss\"). When a court evaluates a RICO claim for proximate causation, the central question it must ask is whether the alleged violation led directly to the plaintiff's injuries. In the instant case, the answer is no. We hold that Ideal's \u00a7 1962(c) claim does not satisfy the requirement of proximate causation.</p>\n<p>Petitioners alternatively ask us to hold, in line with the District Court's decision granting petitioners' motion to dismiss, that a plaintiff may not assert a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud or wire fraud unless it demonstrates it relied on the defendant's misrepresentations. They argue that RICO's private right of action must be interpreted in light of common-law principles, and that at common law a fraud action requires the plaintiff to prove reliance. Because Ideal has not satisfied the proximate-cause requirement articulated in <i>Holmes,</i> we have no occasion to address the substantial question whether a showing of reliance is required. Cf. 503 U. S., at 275-276.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The amended complaint also asserts a RICO claim based on a violation of \u00a7 1962(a). The claim alleges petitioners' tax scheme provided them with funds to open a new store in the Bronx, which attracted customers who otherwise would have purchased from Ideal.</p>\n<p>In this Court petitioners contend that the proximate-cause analysis should function identically for purposes of Ideal's \u00a7 1962(c) claim and its \u00a7 1962(a) claim. (Petitioners also contend that \"a civil RICO plaintiff does not plead an injury proximately caused by a violation of \u00a7 1962(a) merely by alleging that a corporate defendant reinvested profits back into itself,\" Brief for Petitioners 20, n. 5, but this argument has not been developed, and we decline to address it.) It is true that private actions for violations of \u00a7 1962(a), like actions for violations of \u00a7 1962(c), must be asserted under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*462</span> \u00a7 1964(c). It likewise is true that a claim is cognizable under \u00a7 1964(c) only if the defendant's alleged violation proximately caused the plaintiff's injury. The proximate-cause inquiry, however, requires careful consideration of the \"relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\" <i>Holmes, supra,</i> at 268. Because \u00a7 1962(c) and \u00a7 1962(a) set forth distinct prohibitions, it is at least debatable whether Ideal's two claims should be analyzed in an identical fashion for proximate-cause purposes.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals held that Ideal adequately pleaded its \u00a7 1962(a) claim, see 373 F. 3d, at 264, but the court did not address proximate causation. We decline to consider Ideal's \u00a7 1962(a) claim without the benefit of the Court of Appeals' analysis, particularly given that the parties have devoted nearly all their attention in this Court to the \u00a7 1962(c) claim. We therefore vacate the Court of Appeals' judgment with respect to Ideal's \u00a7 1962(a) claim. On remand, the court should determine whether petitioners' alleged violation of \u00a7 1962(a) proximately caused the injuries Ideal asserts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed in part and vacated in part. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the opinion of the Court. I also note that it is inconceivable that the injury alleged in the 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1962(c) claim at issue here is within the zone of interests protected by the RICO cause of action for fraud perpetrated upon New York State. See <i>Holmes</i> v. <i>Securities Investor Protection Corporation,</i> 503 U. S. 258, 286-290 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*463</span> JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>The Court today limits the lawsuits that may be brought under the civil enforcement provision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO or Act), 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1961 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. III), by adopting a theory of proximate causation that is supported neither by the Act nor by our decision in <i>Holmes</i> v. <i>Securities Investor Protection Corporation,</i> 503 U. S. 258, 268 (1992), on which the Court principally relies. The Court's stringent proximate-causation requirement succeeds in precluding recovery in cases alleging a violation of \u00a7 1962(c) that, like the present one, have nothing to do with organized crime, the target of the RICO statute. However, the Court's approach also eliminates recovery for plaintiffs whose injuries are precisely those that Congress aimed to remedy through the authorization of civil RICO suits. Because this frustration of congressional intent is directly contrary to the broad language Congress employed to confer a RICO cause of action, I respectfully dissent from Part II of the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The language of the civil RICO provision, which broadly permits recovery by \"[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation\" of the Act's substantive restrictions, \u00a7 1964(c) (2000 ed.), plainly covers the lawsuit brought by respondent. Respondent alleges that it was injured in its business, and that this injury was the direct result of petitioners' violation of \u00a7 1962(c).<sup>[1]</sup> App. 12-17. In <span class=\"star-pagination\">*464</span> <i>Holmes,</i> however, we held that a RICO plaintiff is required to show that the RICO violation \"not only was a `but for' cause of his injury, but was the proximate cause as well.\" 503 U. S., at 268. We employed the term \"`proximate cause' to label generically the judicial tools used to limit a person's responsibility for the consequences of that person's own acts.\" <i>Ibid.</i> These tools reflect \"`ideas of what justice demands, or of what is administratively possible and convenient.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \u00a7 41, p. 264 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser &amp; Keeton)).</p>\n<p>Invoking one of the common-law proximate-cause considerations, we held that a RICO plaintiff must prove \"some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\" 503 U. S., at 268. Today the Court applies this formulation to conclude that the \"attenuated relationship\" between the violation of \u00a7 1962(c) and Ideal's injury \"implicates fundamental concerns expressed in <i>Holmes</i>\" and that the \"absence of proximate causation is equally clear in both cases.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 459, 458. But the Court's determination relies on a theory of \"directness\" distinct from that adopted by <i>Holmes.</i></p>\n<p>In <i>Holmes,</i> the Court explained that \"a plaintiff who complained of harm flowing merely from the misfortunes visited upon a third person by the defendant's acts was generally said to stand at too remote a distance to recover.\" 503 U. S., at 268-269. The plaintiff in <i>Holmes</i> was indirect in precisely this sense. The defendant was alleged to have participated in a stock manipulation scheme that disabled two broker-dealers from meeting their obligations to customers. Accordingly, the plaintiff, Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), had to advance nearly $13 million to cover the claims of customers of those broker-dealers. SIPC attempted to sue based on the claim that it was subrogated to the rights of those customers of the broker-dealers who did not purchase manipulated securities. We held that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*465</span> the nonpurchasing customers' injury was not proximately caused by the defendant's conduct, because \"the conspirators have allegedly injured these customers only insofar as the stock manipulation first injured the broker-dealers and left them without the wherewithal to pay customers' claims.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 271.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Here, in contrast, it was not <i>New York's injury</i> that caused respondent's damages; rather, it was petitioners' own conduct\u0097namely, their underpayment of tax\u0097that permitted them to undercut respondent's prices and thereby take away its business. Indeed, the Court's acknowledgment that there is no appreciable risk of duplicative recovery here, in contrast to <i>Holmes, ante,</i> at 459, is effectively a concession that petitioners' damages are not indirect, as that term is used in <i>Holmes.</i> See 503 U. S., at 269 (\"[R]ecognizing claims of the indirectly injured would force courts to adopt complicated rules apportioning damages among plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury from the violative acts, to obviate the risk of multiple recoveries\"). The mere fact that New York is a direct victim of petitioners' RICO violation does not preclude Ideal's claim that it too is a direct victim. Because the petitioners' tax underpayment directly caused respondent's injury, <i>Holmes</i> does not bar respondent's recovery.</p>\n<p>The Court nonetheless contends that respondent has failed to demonstrate proximate cause. It does so by relying on our observation in <i>Holmes</i> that the directness requirement is appropriate because \"`[t]he less direct an injury is, the more difficult it becomes to ascertain the amount of a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*466</span> plaintiff's damages attributable to the violation, as distinct from other, independent, factors.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 458 (quoting <i>Holmes, supra,</i> at 269, in turn, citing <i>Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc.</i> v. <i>Carpenters,</i> 459 U. S. 519 (1983)). In <i>Holmes,</i> we noted that it would be hard for the District Court to determine how much of the broker-dealers' failure to pay their customers was due to the fraud and how much was due to other factors affecting the broker-dealers' business success. 503 U. S., at 273-274. The Court contends that here, as in <i>Holmes,</i> it is difficult to \"ascertain the damages caused by some remote action.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 458.</p>\n<p>The Court's reliance on the difficulty of ascertaining the amount of Ideal's damages caused by petitioners' unlawful acts to label those damages indirect is misguided. <i>Holmes</i> and <i>Associated General Contractors</i> simply held that one reason that <i>indirect</i> injuries should not be compensable is that such injuries are difficult to ascertain. <i>Holmes, supra,</i> at 269; <i>Associated Gen. Contractors, supra,</i> at 542. We did not adopt the converse proposition that any injuries that are difficult to ascertain must be classified as indirect for purposes of determining proximate causation.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Proximate cause and certainty of damages, while both related to the plaintiff's responsibility to prove that the amount of damages he seeks is fairly attributable to the defendant, are distinct requirements for recovery in tort.<sup>[4]</sup> See 4 Restatement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*467</span> (Second) of Torts \u00a7 912 (1977) (certainty of damages); 2 <i>id.,</i> \u00a7\u00a7 430-431 (1963-1964) (proximate causation). That is, to recover, a plaintiff must show <i>both</i> that his injury is sufficiently connected to the tort that \"the moral judgment and practical sense of mankind [will] recognize responsibility in the domain of morals,\" Sutherland 18, and that the specific pecuniary advantages, the loss of which is alleged as damages, \"would have resulted, and, therefore, that the act complained of prevented them,\" <i>id.,</i> at 106-107. <i>Holmes</i> and <i>Associated General Contractors</i> dealt primarily with the former showing. The Court's discussion of the union's \"highly speculative\" damages in <i>Associated General Contractors</i> focused not on the difficulty of proving the precise amount of damages, but with \"the tenuous and speculative character of the relationship between the alleged antitrust violation and the Union's alleged injury.\" 459 U. S., at 545. Here, the relationship between the alleged RICO violation and the alleged injury is clear: Petitioners underpaid sales tax, permitting them to undercharge sales tax, inflicting competitive injury on respondent. The question with which the Court expresses concern\u0097whether Ideal can prove the amount of its actual damages \"with sufficient certainty,\" Sutherland 106, 107, to permit recovery\u0097is simply not before the Court.</p>\n<p>It is nonetheless worth noting that the Court overstates the difficulties of proof faced by respondent in this case. Certainly the plaintiff in this case, as in all tort cases involving damage to business, must demonstrate that he suffered a harm caused by the tort, and not merely by external market conditions. See generally Prosser &amp; Keeton \u00a7 130, at 1014-1015, and nn. 92-99 (gathering cases authorizing liability for torts that \"depriv[e] the plaintiff of customers or other prospects\"); cf. <i>Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</i> v. <i>Broudo,</i> 544 U. S. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*468</span> 336, 342 (2005) (\"[A]n inflated purchase price will not itself constitute or proximately cause the relevant economic loss,\" absent evidence that it was the inflated price that actually caused harm). But under the facts as alleged by Ideal, National did not generally lower its prices, so the Court need not inquire into \"any number of reasons,\" <i>ante,</i> at 458, that it might have done so.<sup>[5]</sup> Instead, it simply <i>ceased charging tax</i> on cash sales, allegedly, and logically, because it had ceased reporting those sales and accordingly was not itself paying sales tax on them. App. 11-13. Nor is it fatal to Ideal's proof of damages that National could have continued to charge taxes to its customers and invested the additional money elsewhere. <i>Ante,</i> at 459. Had National actually done so, it might be difficult to ascertain the damages suffered by Ideal as a result of that investment. But the mere fact that National <i>could have</i> committed tax fraud without readily ascertainable injury to Ideal does not mean that its tax fraud <i>necessarily</i> caused no readily ascertainable injury in this case. Likewise, the Court is undoubtedly correct that \"Ideal's lost sales could have resulted from factors other than petitioners' alleged acts of fraud.\" <i>Ibid.</i> However, the means through which the fraudulent scheme was carried out\u0097with sales tax charged on noncash sales, but no tax charged on cash sales\u0097renders the damages more ascertainable than in the typical case of lost business. In any event, it is well within the expertise of a district court to evaluate testimony and evidence and determine what portion of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*469</span> Ideal's lost sales are attributable to National's lower prices and what portion to other factors.</p>\n<p>The Court also relies on an additional reason <i>Holmes</i> gave for limiting recovery to direct victims\u0097namely, that \"[t]he requirement of a direct causal connection is especially warranted where the immediate victims of an alleged RICO violation can be expected to vindicate the laws by pursuing their own claims.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 460 (citing <i>Holmes,</i> 503 U. S., at 269-270). Certainly, New York can sue here and vindicate the law, rendering respondent's enforcement of the law less necessary than it would be if respondent were the only direct victim of the illegal activity. But our recognition in <i>Holmes</i> that limiting recovery to direct victims would not undermine deterrence does not support the conclusion that any victim whose lawsuit is unnecessary for deterrence is an indirect victim. Indeed, in any tort case with multiple possible plaintiffs, a single plaintiff's lawsuit could suffice to vindicate the law. If multiple plaintiffs are direct victims of a tort, it would be unjust to declare some of their lawsuits unnecessary for deterrence, absent any basis for doing so in the relevant statute. Because respondent's injuries result from petitioners' fraud, and not from New York's injuries, respondent has a right to recover equal to that of New York.</p>\n<p>Application of common-law principles of proximate causation beyond the directness requirement likewise supports a finding that causation was sufficiently pleaded in this case. Though the <i>Holmes</i> Court noted that directness was \"one of [the] central elements\" it had considered in evaluating causation, it recognized that proximate causation took \"many shapes\" at common law. <i>Id.,</i> at 268, 269. Cf. Prosser &amp; Keeton \u00a7 42, at 273 (noting \"two contrasting theories of legal cause,\" one extending liability to, but not beyond, \"the scope of the `foreseeable risks,'\" and the other extending liability to, but not beyond, all \"`directly traceable'\" consequences <span class=\"star-pagination\">*470</span> and those indirect consequences that are foreseeable).<sup>[6]</sup> The proximate-cause limitation serves to ensure that \"a defendant is not answerable for anything beyond the natural, ordinary and reasonable consequences of his conduct.\" Sutherland 57. \"If one's fault happens to concur with something extraordinary, and therefore not likely to be foreseen, he will not be answerable for such unexpected result.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Based on this principle, courts have historically found proximate causation for injuries from natural causes, if a wrongful act \"rendered it probable that such an injury will occur,\" <i>id.,</i> at 62; for injuries where the plaintiff's reliance is the immediate cause, such as in an action for fraud, so long as the reliance was \"reasonably induced by the prior misconduct of the defendant,\" <i>id.,</i> at 62, 63; and for injuries where an innocent third party intervenes between the tortfeasor and the victim, such that the innocent third party is the <i>immediate</i> cause of the injury, so long as the tortfeasor \"contributed so effectually to [the injury] as to be regarded as the efficient or at least concurrent and responsible cause,\" <i>id.,</i> at 64, 65 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals, by limiting RICO plaintiffs to those who are \"`the targets, competitors and intended victims of the racketeering enterprise,'\" 373 F. 3d 251, 260 (CA2 2004) (quoting <i>Lerner</i> v. <i>Fleet Bank, N. A.,</i> 318 F. 3d 113, 124 (CA2 2003)), outlined a proximate-causation standard that falls well in line both with the reasoning behind having a proximate-cause requirement at all, and with the traditional applications of this standard to tortfeasors who caused injury only through a two-step process. The Court, in contrast, permits a defendant to evade liability for harms that are not only foreseeable, but the <i>intended</i> consequences of the defendant's unlawful behavior. A defendant may do so simply by concocting a scheme under which a further, lawful and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*471</span> intentional step <i>by the defendant</i> is required to inflict the injury. Such a rule precludes recovery for injuries for which the defendant is plainly morally responsible and which are suffered by easily identifiable plaintiffs. There is no basis in the RICO statute, in common-law tort, or in <i>Holmes</i> for reaching this result.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Because neither the plain language of the civil RICO provision nor our precedent supports the Court's holding, it must be rejected. It is worth noting, however, that while the Court's holding in the present case may prevent litigation in an area far removed from the concerns about organized crime that led to RICO's enactment, that holding also precludes civil recovery for losses sustained by business competitors as a result of quintessential organized criminal activity, cases Congress indisputably intended its broad language to reach.</p>\n<p>Congress plainly enacted RICO to address the problem of organized crime, and not to remedy general state-law criminal violations. See <i>H. J. Inc.</i> v. <i>Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.,</i> 492 U. S. 229, 245 (1989). There is some evidence, to be sure, that the drafters knew that RICO would have the potential to sweep more broadly than organized crime and did not find that problematic. <i>Id.,</i> at 246-248. Nevertheless, the Court has recognized that \"in its private civil version, RICO is evolving into something quite different from the original conception of its enactors.\" <i>Sedima, S. P. R. L.</i> v. <i>Imrex Co.,</i> 473 U. S. 479, 500 (1985).</p>\n<p>Judicial sentiment that civil RICO's evolution is undesirable is widespread.<sup>[7]</sup> Numerous Justices have expressed dissatisfaction <span class=\"star-pagination\">*472</span> with either the breadth of RICO's application, <i>id.,</i> at 501 (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, Blackmun, and Powell, JJ., dissenting) (\"The Court's interpretation of the civil RICO statute quite simply revolutionizes private litigation; it validates the federalization of broad areas of state common law of frauds, and it approves the displacement of well-established federal remedial provisions. . . . [T]here is no indication that Congress even considered, much less approved, the scheme that the Court today defines\"), or its general vagueness at outlining the conduct it is intended to prohibit, <i>H. J. Inc., supra,</i> at 255-256 (Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor and Kennedy, JJ., concurring in judgment) (\"No constitutional challenge to this law has been raised in the present case . . . . That the highest Court in the land has been unable to derive from this statute anything more than today's meager guidance bodes ill for the day when that challenge is presented\"). Indeed, proposals for curtailing civil RICO have been introduced in Congress; for example, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, enacted in 1995, removed securities fraud as a predicate act under RICO. Pub. L. 104-67, \u00a7 107, 109 Stat. 758, amending 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1964(c); see also Abrams, Crime Legislation and the Public Interest: Lessons from Civil RICO, 50 SMU L. Rev. 33, 34 (1996).</p>\n<p>This case, like the majority of civil RICO cases, has no apparent connection to organized crime. See <i>Sedima,</i> 473 U. S., at 499, n. 16 (quoting an ABA Task Force determination that, over the period reviewed, only 9% of civil RICO cases at the trial court level involved \"`allegations of criminal activity of a type generally associated with professional criminals'\"). Given the distance the facts of this case lie <span class=\"star-pagination\">*473</span> from the prototypical organized criminal activity that led to RICO's enactment, it is tempting to find in the Act a limitation that will keep at least this and similar cases out of court.</p>\n<p>The Court's attempt to exclude this case from the reach of civil RICO, however, succeeds in eliminating not only cases that lie far outside the harm RICO was intended to correct, but also those that were at the core of Congress' concern in enacting the statute. The Court unanimously recognized in <i>Sedima</i> that one reason\u0097and, for the dissent, the principal reason\u0097Congress enacted RICO was to protect businesses against competitive injury from organized crime. See <i>id.,</i> at 500-523 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (concluding that the provision conferring a right of action on individual plaintiffs had as its \"principal target . . . the economic power of racketeers, and its toll on legitimate businessmen\"); <i>id.,</i> at 494-500.</p>\n<p>The unanimous view of the <i>Sedima</i> Court is correct. The sponsor of a Senate precursor to RICO noted that \"`<i>the</i> evil to be curbed is the unfair competitive advantage inherent in the large amount of illicit income available to organized crime.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 514 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (quoting 113 Cong. Rec. 17999 (1967) (remarks of Sen. Hruska); some emphasis deleted); see also 473 U. S., at 515 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (\"`When organized crime moves into a business, it brings all the techniques of violence and intimidation which it used in its illegal businesses. Competitors are eliminated and customers confined to sponsored suppliers'\"). Upon adding a provision for a civil remedy in a subsequently proposed bill, Senator Hruska noted:</p>\n<blockquote>\"`[This] bill also creates civil remedies for the honest businessman who has been damaged by unfair competition from the racketeer businessman. Despite the willingness of the courts to apply the Sherman Anti-Trust Act to organized crime activities, as a practical matter the legitimate businessman does not have adequate civil remedies available under that act. This bill fills that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*474</span> gap.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 516 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (quoting 115 Cong. Rec. 6993 (1969); emphasis deleted).</blockquote>\n<p>A portion of these bills was ultimately included in RICO, which was attached as Title IX to the Organized Crime Control Act. The Committee Report noted that the Title \"has as its purpose the elimination of the infiltration of organized crime and racketeering into legitimate organizations operating in interstate commerce.\" S. Rep. No. 91-617, p. 76 (1969).</p>\n<p>The observations of the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, the source of much of the congressional concern over organized crime, are consistent with these statements. Its chapter on organized crime noted that \"organized crime is also extensively and deeply involved in legitimate business . . . . [I]t employs illegitimate methods\u0097monopolization, terrorism, extortion, tax evasion\u0097to drive out or control lawful ownership and leadership and to exact illegal profits from the public.\" The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society 187 (1967). The report noted that \"[t]he millions of dollars [organized crime] can throw into the legitimate economic system gives it power to manipulate the price of shares on the stock market, to raise or lower the price of retail merchandise, to determine whether entire industries are union or nonunion, to make it easier or harder for businessmen to continue in business.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>It is not difficult to imagine a competitive injury to a business that would result from the kind of organized crime that <i>Sedima,</i> Congress, and the Commission all recognized as the principal concern of RICO, yet that would fail the Court's restrictive proximate-cause test. For example, an organized crime group, running a legitimate business, could, through threats of violence, persuade its supplier to sell goods to it at cost, so that it could resell those goods at a lower price to drive its competitor out of the business. Honest businessmen would be unable to compete, as they do not engage in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*475</span> threats of violence to lower their costs. Civil RICO, if it was intended to do anything at all, was intended to give those businessmen a cause of action. Cf. <i>Sedima,</i> 473 U. S., at 521-522 (Marshall, J., dissenting). Yet just like respondent, those businessmen would not themselves be the immediate target of the threats; the target would be the supplier. Like respondent's injury, their injury would be most immediately caused by the lawful activity of price competition, not the unlawful activity of threatening the supplier. Accordingly, under the Court's view, the honest businessman competitor would be just an \"indirect\" victim, whose injury was not proximately caused by the RICO violation.<sup>[8]</sup> Civil RICO would thus confer no right to sue on the individual who did not himself suffer the threats of violence, even if the threats caused him harm.</p>\n<p>As a result, after today, civil RICO plaintiffs that suffer precisely the kind of injury that motivated the adoption of the civil RICO provision will be unable to obtain relief. If this result was compelled by the text of the statute, the interference with congressional intent would be unavoidable. Given that the language is not even fairly susceptible of such a reading, however, I cannot agree with this frustration of congressional intent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Because I conclude that Ideal has sufficiently pleaded proximate cause, I must proceed to the question which the Court does not reach: whether reliance is a required element of a RICO claim predicated on mail or wire fraud and, if it is, whether that reliance must be by the plaintiff. The Court of Appeals held that reliance is required, but that \"a RICO claim based on mail fraud may be proven where the misrepresentations were relied on by a third person, rather than <span class=\"star-pagination\">*476</span> by the plaintiff.\" 373 F. 3d, at 262, 263. I disagree with the conclusion that reliance is required at all. In my view, the mere fact that the predicate acts underlying a particular RICO violation happen to be fraud offenses does not mean that reliance, an element of common-law fraud, is also incorporated as an element of a civil RICO claim.</p>\n<p>Petitioners are correct that the common law generally required a showing of justifiable reliance before a plaintiff could recover for damages caused by fraud. See <i>Neder</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 527 U. S. 1, 24-25 (1999); Prosser &amp; Keeton \u00a7 105, at 728. But RICO does not confer on private plaintiffs a right to sue defendants who engage in any act of commonlaw fraud; instead, racketeering activity includes, as relevant to this case, \"any act which is indictable under [18 U. S. C. \u00a7] 1341 (relating to mail fraud) [and \u00a7] 1343 (relating to wire fraud).\" \u00a7 1961(1) (2000 ed., Supp. III). And we have recognized that these criminal fraud statutes \"did not incorporate <i>all</i> the elements of common-law fraud.\" <i>Neder,</i> 527 U. S., at 24. Instead, the criminal mail fraud statute applies to anyone who, \"having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud . . . for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, places in any post office . . . any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by the Postal Service . . . .\" \u00a7 1341. See \u00a7 1343 (similar language for wire fraud). We have specifically noted that \"[b]y prohibiting the `scheme to defraud,' rather than the completed fraud, the elements of reliance . . . would clearly be inconsistent with the statutes Congress enacted.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 25.</p>\n<p>Because an individual can commit an indictable act of mail or wire fraud even if no one relies on his fraud, he can engage in a pattern of racketeering activity, in violation of \u00a7 1962, without proof of reliance. Accordingly, it cannot be disputed that the Government could prosecute a person for such behavior. The terms of \u00a7 1964(c) (2000 ed.), which broadly authorize suit by \"[a]ny person injured in his business or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*477</span> property by reason of a violation of section 1962,\" permit no different conclusion when an individual brings a civil action against such a RICO violator.</p>\n<p>It is true that our decision in <i>Holmes</i> to apply the common-law proximate-cause requirement was likewise not compelled by the broad language of the statute. But our decision in that case was justified by the \"very unlikelihood that Congress meant to allow all factually injured plaintiffs to recover.\" 503 U. S., at 266. This unlikelihood stems, in part, from the nature of proximate cause, which is \"not only a general condition of civil liability at common law but is almost essential to shape and delimit a rational remedy.\" <i>Systems Management, Inc.</i> v. <i>Loiselle,</i> 303 F. 3d 100, 104 (CA1 2002). We also decided <i>Holmes</i> in light of Congress' decision to use the same words to impose civil liability under RICO as it had in \u00a7 7 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 210, into which federal courts had implied a proximate-cause limitation. 503 U. S., at 268. Accordingly, it was fair to interpret the broad language \"by reason of\" as meaning, in all civil RICO cases, that the violation must be both the cause-in-fact and the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury.</p>\n<p>Here, by contrast, the civil action provision cannot be read to always require that the plaintiff have relied on the defendant's action. Reliance is not a general limitation on civil recovery in tort; it \"is a specialized condition that happens to have grown up with common law fraud.\" <i>Loiselle, supra,</i> at 104. For most of the predicate acts underlying RICO violations, it cannot be argued that the common law, if it even recognized such acts as civilly actionable, required proof of reliance. See \u00a7 1961 (2000 ed., Supp. III). In other words, there is no language in \u00a7 1964(c) (2000 ed.) that could fairly be read to add a reliance requirement in fraud cases only. Nor is there any reason to believe that Congress would have defined \"racketeering activity\" to include acts indictable under the mail and wire fraud statutes, if it intended fraud-related acts to be predicate acts under RICO only <span class=\"star-pagination\">*478</span> when those acts would have been actionable under the common law.</p>\n<p>Because reliance cannot be read into \u00a7\u00a7 1341 and 1343, nor into RICO itself, it is not an element of a civil RICO claim. This is not to say that, in the general case, a plaintiff will not have to prove that someone relied on the predicate act of fraud as part of his case. If, for example, New York had not believed petitioners' misrepresentation with respect to their sales, Ideal may well not have been injured by petitioners' scheme, which would have faltered at the first step. Indeed, petitioners recognize that \"in the ordinary misrepresentation case, the reliance requirement simply functions as a necessary prerequisite to establishing the causation required by the language of \u00a7 1964(c).\" Brief for Petitioners 29. But the fact that proof of reliance is often used to prove an element of the plaintiff's cause of action, such as the element of causation, does not transform reliance itself into an element of the cause of action. See <i>Loiselle, supra,</i> at 104 (\"Reliance is doubtless the most obvious way in which fraud can cause harm, but it is not the only way\"). Because respondent need not allege reliance at all, its complaint, which alleges that New York relied on petitioners' misrepresentations, App. 16, is more than sufficient.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The Congress that enacted RICO may never have intended to reach cases like the one before us, and may have \"federalize[d] a great deal of state common law\" without any intention of \"produc[ing] these far-reaching results.\" <i>Sedima,</i> 473 U. S., at 506 (Marshall, J., dissenting). But this Court has always refused to ignore the language of the statute to limit it to \"the archetypal, intimidating mobster,\" and has instead recognized that \"[i]t is not for the judiciary to eliminate the private action in situations where Congress has provided it simply because plaintiffs are not taking advantage of it in its more difficult applications.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 499-500. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*479</span> Today, however, the Court not only eliminates private RICO actions in some situations Congress may have inadvertently regulated, but it substantially limits the ability of civil RICO to reach even those cases that motivated Congress' enactment of this provision in the first place. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>In my view, the civil damages remedy in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968 (2000 ed. and Supp. III), does not cover claims of injury by one competitor where the legitimate procompetitive activity of another competitor immediately causes that injury. I believe that this is such a case and would consequently hold that RICO does not authorize the private action here at issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>RICO essentially seeks to prevent organized criminals from taking over or operating legitimate businesses. Its language, however, extends its scope well beyond those central purposes. RICO begins by listing certain predicate acts, called \"`racketeering activity,'\" which consist of other crimes, ranging from criminal copyright activities, the facilitation of gambling, and mail fraud to arson, kidnaping, and murder. \u00a7 1961(1) (2000 ed., Supp. III). It then defines a \"`pattern of racketeering activity'\" to include engaging in \"at least two\" predicate acts in a 10-year period. \u00a7 1961(5) (2000 ed.). And it forbids certain business-related activities involving such a \"pattern\" and an \"enterprise.\" The forbidden activities include using funds derived from a \"pattern of racketeering activity\" in acquiring, establishing, or operating any enterprise, and conducting the affairs of any enterprise through such \"a pattern.\" \u00a7\u00a7 1962(a), (c).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*480</span> RICO, a federal criminal statute, foresees criminal law enforcement by the Federal Government. \u00a7 1963 (2000 ed., Supp. III). It also sets forth civil remedies. \u00a7 1964 (2000 ed.). District courts \"have jurisdiction to prevent and restrain [RICO] violations.\" \u00a7 1964(a). And a person \"injured in his business or property by reason of a [RICO] violation\" may seek treble damages and attorney's fees. \u00a7 1964(c).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The present case is a private RICO treble-damages action. A steel supply company, Ideal Steel, has sued a competing steel supply company, National Steel, and its owners, Joseph and Vincent Anza (to whom I shall refer collectively as \"National\"). Ideal says that National committed mail fraud by regularly filing false New York state sales tax returns in order to avoid paying sales tax that it owed\u0097activity that amounts to a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\" This activity enabled National to charge lower prices without reducing its profit margins. Ideal says National used some of these excess profits to fund the building of a new store. Both the lower prices and the new outlet attracted Ideal customers, thereby injuring Ideal. Hence, says Ideal, it was injured \"in [its] business . . . by reason of\" violations of two RICO provisions, the provision that forbids conducting an \"enterprise's affairs\" through a \"pattern of racketeering activity\" and the provision that forbids investing funds derived from such a \"pattern\" in an \"enterprise.\" \u00a7\u00a7 1962(c), (a), 1964(c). The question before us is whether RICO permits Ideal to bring this private treble-damages claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>This Court, in <i>Holmes</i> v. <i>Securities Investor Protection Corporation,</i> 503 U. S. 258, 268 (1992), held that RICO's private treble-damages provision \"demand[ed] . . . some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\" The Court then determined that the injury <span class=\"star-pagination\">*481</span> alleged by the plaintiff in that case was too remote from the injurious conduct to satisfy this requirement.</p>\n<p>I do not agree with the majority insofar as it believes that <i>Holmes'</i> holding in respect to the fact pattern there at issue virtually dictates the answer to the question here. In my view, the \"causal connection\" between the forbidden conduct and plaintiff's harm is, in certain key ways, more direct here than it was in <i>Holmes.</i> In <i>Holmes,</i> the RICO plaintiff was a surrogate for creditors of broker-dealers that went bankrupt after losing money in stocks that had been overvalued due to fraudulent statements made by the RICO defendant and others. Put in terms of \"proximate cause,\" the plaintiff's harm (an ordinary creditor loss) differed in kind from the harm that the \"predicate acts\" (securities fraud) would ordinarily cause (stock-related monetary losses). The harm was \"indirect\" in the sense that it was entirely derivative of the more direct harm the defendant's actions had caused the broker-dealers; and, there were several steps between the violation and the harm (misrepresentation\u0097broker-dealer losses\u0097broker-dealer business failure\u0097ordinary creditor loss). Here, however, the plaintiff alleges a harm (lost customers) that flows directly from the lower prices and the opening of a new outlet\u0097actions that were themselves allegedly caused by activity that Congress designed RICO to forbid (conducting a business through a \"pattern\" of \"predicate acts\" and investing in business funds derived from such a \"pattern\"). In this sense, the causal links before us are more \"direct\" than those in <i>Holmes.</i> See <i>ante,</i> at 464-465 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, I agree with the majority that <i>Holmes</i> points the way. That case makes clear that RICO contains important limitations on the scope of private rights of action. It specifies that RICO does not provide a private right of action \"simply on showing that the defendant violated \u00a7 1962, the plaintiff was injured, and the defendant's violation was a `but for' cause of [the] plaintiff's injury.\" 503 U. S., at 265-266 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*482</span> (footnote omitted). Pointing out \"the very unlikelihood that Congress meant to allow <i>all</i> factually injured plaintiffs to recover,\" <i>id.,</i> at 266 (emphasis added), <i>Holmes</i> concludes that RICO imposes a requirement of \"proximate cause,\" a phrase that \"label[s] generically the judicial tools used to limit a person's responsibility for the consequences of that person's own acts,\" <i>id.,</i> at 268. It recognizes that these tools seek to discern \"`what justice demands, or . . . what is administratively possible and convenient.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \u00a7 41, p. 264 (5th ed. 1984)). It also explains that \"proximate cause\" demands \"directness,\" while specifying that \"directness\" is only one of \"the many shapes this concept took at common law.\" 503 U. S., at 268, 269. And it points to antitrust law, both as a source of RICO's trebledamages provisions and as an aid to their interpretation. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>In my view, the \"antitrust\" nature of the treble-damages provision's source, taken together with both RICO's basic objectives and important administrative concerns, implies that a cause is \"indirect,\" <i>i. e.,</i> it is not a \"proximate cause,\" if the causal chain from forbidden act to the injury caused a competitor proceeds through a legitimate business' ordinary competitive activity. To use a physical metaphor, ordinary competitive actions undertaken by the defendant competitor cut the <i>direct</i> causal link between the plaintiff competitor's injuries and the forbidden acts.</p>\n<p>The basic objective of antitrust law is to encourage the competitive process. In particular, that law encourages businesses to compete by offering lower prices, better products, better methods of production, and better systems of distribution. See, <i>e. g.,</i> 1 P. Areeda &amp; H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application \u00b6 100a, pp. 3-4 (2d ed. 2000). As I shall explain, these principles suggest that RICO does not permit private action based solely upon this competitive type of harm, <i>i. e.,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*483</span> harm a plaintiff suffers only because the defendant was able to attract customers through normal competitive methods, such as lower prices, better products, better methods of production, or better systems of distribution. In such cases, the harm falls outside the limits that RICO's private trebledamages provision's \"proximate-cause\" requirement imposes. In such cases the distance between the harm and the predicate acts that funded (or otherwise enabled) such ordinary competitive activity is too distant. The harm is not \"direct.\"</p>\n<p>At the same time, those principles suggest that other types of competitive injuries not within their protective ambit could lie within, not outside, \"proximate-cause\" limits. Where, for example, a RICO defendant attracts customers in ways that involve illegitimate competitive means, <i>e. g.,</i> by threatening violence, a claim may still lie. Claims involving RICO violations that objectively target a particular competitor, <i>e. g.,</i> bribing an official to harass a competitor, could also be actionable.</p>\n<p>Several considerations lead to this conclusion. First, I have found no case (outside the Second Circuit, from which this case arose) in which a court has authorized a private treble-damages suit based upon no more than a legitimate business' ordinary procompetitive activity (even where financed by the proceeds of a RICO predicate act).</p>\n<p>Second, an effort to bring harm caused by ordinary competitive activity within the scope of RICO's private trebledamages action provision will raise serious problems of administrability. <i>Ante,</i> at 458-460 (majority opinion); see also <i>Holmes, supra,</i> at 269. To demonstrate that a defendant's lower price caused a plaintiff to lose customers (or profits) requires the plaintiff to show what would have happened in its absence. Would customers have changed suppliers irrespective of the price change because of other differences in the suppliers? Would other competing firms have lowered their prices? Would higher prices have attracted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*484</span> new entry? Would demand for the industry's product, or the geographic scope of the relevant market, have changed? If so, how? To answer such questions based upon actual market circumstances and to apportion damages among the various competitors harmed is difficult even for plaintiffs trying to trace harm caused by a defendants' <i>anti</i>-competitive behavior. <i>Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc.</i> v. <i>Carpenters,</i> 459 U. S. 519, 542, 544 (1983) (the possibility that harm \"may have been produced by independent factors\" and \"the danger of complex apportionment of damages\" weigh against finding the requisite causal connection in an antitrust case). To answer such questions in the context of better functioning markets, where prices typically reflect competitive conditions, would likely prove yet more difficult.</p>\n<p>Third, where other victims, say, victims of the underlying RICO \"predicate acts\" are present, there is no pressing need to provide such an action. Those alternative victims (here the State of New York) typically \"could be counted on to bring suit for the law's vindication.\" <i>Holmes, supra,</i> at 273. They could thus fulfill Congress' aim in adopting the civil remedy of \"turn[ing victims] into prosecutors, `private attorneys general,' dedicated to eliminating racketeering activity.\" <i>Rotella</i> v. <i>Wood,</i> 528 U. S. 549, 557 (2000) (citing <i>Klehr</i> v. <i>A. O. Smith Corp.,</i> 521 U. S. 179, 187 (1997)).</p>\n<p>Fourth, this approach to proximate cause would retain private actions aimed at the heart of Congress' relevant RICO concerns. RICO's sponsors, in reporting their underlying reasons for supporting RICO, emphasized, not the fair, ordinary competition that an infiltrated business might offer its competitors, but the risk that such a business would act corruptly, exercising <i>unfair</i> methods of competition. S. Rep. No. 91-617, pp. 76-78 (1969); see also <i>Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd.</i> v. <i>King,</i> 533 U. S. 158, 165 (2001). RICO focuses upon the \"infiltration of legitimate business by organized crime,\" in significant part because, when \"`organized crime moves into a business, it brings all the techniques of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*485</span> violence and intimidation which it used in its illegal businesses.'\" <i>Sedima, S. P. R. L.</i> v. <i>Imrex Co.,</i> 473 U. S. 479, 517, 515 (1985) (Marshall, J., dissenting) (quoting 113 Cong. Rec. 17999 (1967)).</p>\n<p>My approach would not rule out private actions in such cases. Nor would it rule out three of the four suits mentioned by Justice Marshall, dissenting in <i>Sedima,</i> when he describes RICO's objectives. It would not rule out lawsuits by injured competitors or legitimate investors if a racketeer, \"uses `[t]hreats, arson and assault . . . to force competitors out of business'\"; \"uses arson and threats to induce honest businessmen to pay protection money, or to purchase certain goods, or to hire certain workers\"; or \"displace[s]\" an \"honest investor\" when he \"infiltrates and obtains control of a legitimate business . . . through fraud\" or the like. 473 U. S., at 521, 522.</p>\n<p>I concede that the approach would rule out a competitor's lawsuit based on no more than an \"infiltrated enterprise\" operating a legitimate business to a businessman's competitive disadvantage because unlawful predicate acts helped that legitimate business build a \"strong economic base.\" And I recognize that this latter kind of suit at least arguably would have provided helpful deterrence had the view of <i>Sedima's dissenting Justices</i> prevailed. <i>Id.,</i> at 500-523 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (arguing that RICO's private action provision did not authorize suits based on harm flowing directly from predicate acts); <i>id.,</i> at 523-530 (Powell, J., dissenting) (same). But the dissent did not prevail, and the need for deterrence consequently offers only weakened support for a reading of RICO that authorizes private suits in this category.</p>\n<p>Fifth, without this limitation, RICO enforcement and basic antitrust policy could well collide. Firms losing the competitive battle might find bases for a RICO attack on their more successful competitors in claimed misrepresentations or even comparatively minor misdeeds by that competitor. Firms <span class=\"star-pagination\">*486</span> that fear such treble-damages suits might hesitate to compete vigorously, particularly in concentrated industries where harm to a competitor is more easily traced but where the consumer's need for vigorous competition is particularly strong. The ultimate victim of any such tendency to pull ordinary competitive punches of course would be not the competing business, but the consumer. Although Congress did not intend its RICO treble-damages provision as a simple copy of the antitrust laws' similar remedies, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Sedima, supra,</i> at 498-499, there is no sound reason to interpret RICO's treble-damages provision as if Congress intended to set it and its antitrust counterpart at cross-purposes.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I would read into the private trebledamages provision a \"proximate-cause\" limitation that places outside the provision harms that are traceable to an unlawful act only through a form of legitimate competitive activity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Applying this approach to the present case, I would hold that neither of Ideal's counts states a RICO private trebledamages claim. National is a legitimate business. Another private plaintiff (the State of New York) is available. The question is whether Ideal asserts a harm caused directly by something other than ordinary competitive activity, <i>i. e.,</i> lower prices, a better product, a better distribution system, or a better production method.</p>\n<p>Ideal's second count claims injury caused by National's (1) having taken customers (2) attracted by its new store (3) that it financed in part through profits generated by the tax fraud scheme, and the financing is the relevant violation. \u00a7 1962(a). The opening of a distribution outlet is a legitimate competitive activity. It benefits the firm that opens it by making it more convenient for customers to purchase from that supplier. That ordinary competitive process is all the complaint describes. And for the reasons I have given <span class=\"star-pagination\">*487</span> in Part II, <i>supra,</i> I believe that the financing of a new store\u0097even with funds generated by unlawful activities\u0097is not sufficient to create a private cause of action as long as the activity funded amounts to legitimate competitive activity. Ideal must look for other remedies, <i>e. g.,</i> bringing the facts to the attention of the United States Attorney or the State of New York.</p>\n<p>Ideal's first count presents a more difficult question. It alleges that National filed false sales tax returns to the State of New York. As an action indictable under the federal mail fraud statute, that action is a predicate act under RICO. See \u00a7 1961(1) (2000 ed., Supp. III). National passed these savings on to its cash customers by not charging them sales tax, thereby attracting more cash customers than it would have without the scheme. Is this a form of injury caused, not by ordinary competitive activity, but simply by the predicate act itself?</p>\n<p>In my view, the answer to this question is \"no.\" The complaint alleges predicate acts that amount simply to the facts that National did not \"charge\" or \"pay\" sales taxes or accurately \"report\" sales figures to the State. National did not tell its customers, \"We shall not pay sales taxes.\" Rather, it simply charged the customer a lower price, say, $100 rather than $100 plus $8 tax. Consider a retailer who advertises to the customer a $100 table and adds, \"We pay all sales taxes.\" Such a retailer is telling the customer that he will charge the customer a lower price by the amount of the tax, <i>i. e.,</i> about $92. The retailer implies that he, the retailer, will pay the tax to the State, taking the requisite amount owed to the State from the $100 the customer paid for the item.</p>\n<p>The defendants here have done no more. They have in effect cut the price of the item by the amount of the sales tax and then kept the money instead of passing it on to the State. They funded the price cut from the savings, but the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*488</span> source of the savings is, in my view, beside the point as long as the price cut itself is legitimate. I can find nothing in the complaint that suggests it is not.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals on both counts.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  <i>Gene C. Schaerr, Linda T. Coberly, Charles B. Klein, Robin S. Conrad,</i> and <i>Amar D. Sarwal</i> filed a brief for the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America as <i>amicus curiae</i> urging reversal.\n</p>\n<p><i>Henry H. Rossbacher</i> and <i>G. Robert Blakey</i> filed a brief for the National Association of Shareholder and Consumer Attorneys as <i>amicus curiae</i> urging affirmance.</p>\n<p>[1]  Respondent also alleges that petitioners injured its business through a violation of \u00a7 1962(a), although the parties dedicate little attention to this issue. In light of the Court's disposition of the \u00a7 1962(c) claim and the limited discussion of \u00a7 1962(a) by the parties, I agree with the Court that we should give the Court of Appeals the first opportunity to reconsider the \u00a7 1962(a) claim. Accordingly, I join Part III of the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p>[2]  Sutherland's treatise on damages, on which the Court relied in <i>Holmes,</i> labels the same type of claims indirect: those where one party is injured, and it is that very injury\u0097and not the wrongful behavior by the tortfeasor\u0097that causes the injury to the plaintiff. See 1 J. Sutherland, Law of Damages 55 (1882) (hereinafter Sutherland). Indeed, every example cited in Sutherland in illustration of this principle parallels <i>Holmes;</i> the plaintiff would not be injured absent the injury to another victim. See Sutherland 55-56.</p>\n<p>[3]  Indeed, in <i>Associated General Contractors,</i> we did not even squarely hold that the reason that indirect damages are not compensable was that the damages were not easily ascertainable; instead, we merely recognized the empirical fact that \"[p]artly because it is indirect, and partly because the alleged effects on the Union may have been produced by independent factors, the Union's damages claim is also highly speculative.\" 459 U. S., at 542.</p>\n<p>[4]  Sutherland described the interrelation between the two concepts: \"A fatal uncertainty may infect a case where an injury is easily provable, but the alleged responsible cause cannot be sufficiently established as to the whole or some part of that injury. So it may exist where a known and provable wrong or violation of contract appears, but the alleged loss or injury as a result of it cannot be certainly shown.\" Sutherland 94.</p>\n<p>[5]  Nor is it fair to require a plaintiff to prove that the tort caused the lowering of prices at the motion to dismiss stage. Ideal's complaint alleges that petitioners \"pass on to National's customers the sales tax `savings' that National realizes as a result of its false returns.\" App. 16. This allegation that, as a factual matter, National was able to charge a lower price after tax because of its fraud suffices to permit Ideal to survive a motion to dismiss on the question whether the prices were lowered due to the fraud, as opposed to other factors.</p>\n<p>[6]  Prosser and Keeton appear to use \"direct\" in a broader sense than that adopted by the Court in <i>Holmes.</i> See Prosser &amp; Keeton \u00a7 43, at 273, 293-297.</p>\n<p>[7]  See Rehnquist, Remarks of the Chief Justice, 21 St. Mary's L. J. 5, 13 (1989) (\"I think that the time has arrived for Congress to enact amendments to civil RICO to limit its scope to the sort of wrongs that are connected to organized crime, or have some other reason for being in federal court\"); Sentelle, Civil RICO: The Judges' Perspective, and Some Notes on Practice for North Carolina Lawyers, 12 Campbell L. Rev. 145, 148 (1990) (\"[E]very single district judge with whom I have discussed the subject (and I'm talking in the dozens of district judges from across the country) echoes the entreaty expressed in the Chief Justice's title in <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>[, Get RICO Cases Out of My Courtroom, May 19, 1989, p. A14, col. 4]\").</p>\n<p>[8]  The honest businessman would likewise fail Justice Scalia's theory of proximate causation, because laws against threats of violence are intended to protect those who are so threatened, not other parties that might suffer as a consequence. <i>Ante,</i> at 462 (concurring opinion).</p>\n\n</div>",
