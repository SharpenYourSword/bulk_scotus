We conclude that they may.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>This case arises out of a melee that occurred in a Brigham City, Utah, home in the early morning hours of July 23, 2000. At about 3 a.m., four police officers responded to a call regarding <span class=\"star-pagination\">*401</span> a loud party at a residence. Upon arriving at the house, they heard shouting from inside, and proceeded down the driveway to investigate. There, they observed two juveniles drinking beer in the backyard. They entered the backyard, and saw\u0097through a screen door and windows\u0097an altercation taking place in the kitchen of the home. According to the testimony of one of the officers, four adults were attempting, with some difficulty, to restrain a juvenile. The juvenile eventually \"broke free, swung a fist and struck one of the adults in the face.\" 2005 UT 13, \u00b6 2, 122 P. 3d 506, 508. The officer testified that he observed the victim of the blow spitting blood into a nearby sink. App. 40. The other adults continued to try to restrain the juvenile, pressing him up against a refrigerator with such force that the refrigerator began moving across the floor. At this point, an officer opened the screen door and announced the officers' presence. Amid the tumult, nobody noticed. The officer entered the kitchen and again cried out, and as the occupants slowly became aware that the police were on the scene, the altercation ceased.</p>\n<p>The officers subsequently arrested respondents and charged them with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, disorderly conduct, and intoxication. In the trial court, respondents filed a motion to suppress all evidence obtained after the officers entered the home, arguing that the warrantless entry violated the Fourth Amendment. The court granted the motion, and the Utah Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p>Before the Supreme Court of Utah, Brigham City argued that although the officers lacked a warrant, their entry was nevertheless reasonable on either of two grounds. The court rejected both contentions and, over two dissenters, affirmed. First, the court held that the injury caused by the juvenile's punch was insufficient to trigger the so-called \"emergency aid doctrine\" because it did not give rise to an \"objectively reasonable belief that an unconscious, semiconscious, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*402</span> or missing person feared injured or dead [was] in the home.\" 122 P. 3d, at 513 (internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, the court suggested that the doctrine was inapplicable because the officers had not sought to assist the injured adult, but instead had acted \"exclusively in their law enforcement capacity.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The court also held that the entry did not fall within the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement. This exception applies, the court explained, where police have probable cause and where \"a reasonable person [would] believe that the entry was necessary to prevent physical harm to the officers or other persons.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 514 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under this standard, the court stated, the potential harm need not be as serious as that required to invoke the emergency aid exception. Although it found the case \"a close and difficult call,\" the court nevertheless concluded that the officers' entry was not justified by exigent circumstances. <i>Id.,</i> at 515.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 546 U. S. 1085 (2006), in light of differences among state courts and the Courts of Appeals concerning the appropriate Fourth Amendment standard governing warrantless entry by law enforcement in an emergency situation. Compare <i>In re Sealed Case 96-3167,</i> 153 F. 3d 759, 766 (CADC 1998) (\"[T]he standard for exigent circumstances is an objective one\"), and <i>People</i> v. <i>Hebert,</i> 46 P. 3d 473, 480 (Colo. 2002) (en banc) (considering the circumstances as they \"would have been objectively examined by a prudent and trained police officer\"), with <i>United States</i> v. <i>Cervantes,</i> 219 F. 3d 882, 890 (CA9 2000) (\"[U]nder the emergency doctrine, `[a] search must not be primarily motivated by intent to arrest and seize evidence'\" (quoting <i>People</i> v. <i>Mitchell,</i> 39 N. Y. 2d 173, 177, 347 N. E. 2d 607, 609 (1976)), and <i>State</i> v. <i>Mountford,</i> 171 Vt. 487, 492, 769 A. 2d 639, 645 (2000) (<i>Mitchell</i> test \"requir[es] courts to find that the primary subjective motivation behind such searches was to provide emergency aid\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*403</span> II</h2>\n<p>It is a \"`basic principle of Fourth Amendment law that searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable.'\" <i>Groh</i> v. <i>Ramirez,</i> 540 U. S. 551, 559 (2004) (quoting <i>Payton</i> v. <i>New York,</i> 445 U. S. 573, 586 (1980); some internal quotation marks omitted). Nevertheless, because the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is \"reasonableness,\" the warrant requirement is subject to certain exceptions. <i>Flippo</i> v. <i>West Virginia,</i> 528 U. S. 11, 13 (1999) (<i>per curiam</i>); <i>Katz</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 389 U. S. 347, 357 (1967). We have held, for example, that law enforcement officers may make a warrantless entry onto private property to fight a fire and investigate its cause, <i>Michigan</i> v. <i>Tyler,</i> 436 U. S. 499, 509 (1978), to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence, <i>Ker</i> v. <i>California,</i> 374 U. S. 23, 40 (1963) (plurality opinion), or to engage in \"`hot pursuit'\" of a fleeing suspect, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Santana,</i> 427 U. S. 38, 42, 43 (1976). \"[W]arrants are generally required to search a person's home or his person unless `the exigencies of the situation' make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that the warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\" <i>Mincey</i> v. <i>Arizona,</i> 437 U. S. 385, 393-394 (1978).</p>\n<p>One exigency obviating the requirement of a warrant is the need to assist persons who are seriously injured or threatened with such injury. \"`The need to protect or preserve life or avoid serious injury is justification for what would be otherwise illegal absent an exigency or emergency.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 392 (quoting <i>Wayne</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 318 F. 2d 205, 212 (CADC 1963) (Burger, J.)); see also <i>Tyler, supra,</i> at 509. Accordingly, law enforcement officers may enter a home without a warrant to render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or to protect an occupant from imminent injury. <i>Mincey, supra,</i> at 392; see also <i>Georgia</i> v. <i>Randolph, ante,</i> at 118 (\"[I]t would be silly to suggest that the police would commit a tort by entering . . . to determine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*404</span> whether violence (or threat of violence) has just occurred or is about to (or soon will) occur\").</p>\n<p>Respondents do not take issue with these principles, but instead advance two reasons why the officers' entry here was unreasonable. First, they argue that the officers were more interested in making arrests than quelling violence. They urge us to consider, in assessing the reasonableness of the entry, whether the officers were \"indeed motivated primarily by a desire to save lives and property.\" Brief for Respondents 3; see also Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 6 (entry to render emergency assistance justifies a search \"only when the searching officer is acting outside his traditional law-enforcement capacity\"). The Utah Supreme Court also considered the officers' subjective motivations relevant. See 122 P. 3d, at 513 (search under the \"emergency aid doctrine\" may not be \"primarily motivated by intent to arrest and seize evidence\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>Our cases have repeatedly rejected this approach. An action is \"reasonable\" under the Fourth Amendment, regardless of the individual officer's state of mind, \"as long as the circumstances, viewed <i>objectively,</i> justify [the] action.\" <i>Scott</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 436 U. S. 128, 138 (1978) (emphasis added). The officer's subjective motivation is irrelevant. See <i>Bond</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 529 U. S. 334, 338, n. 2 (2000) (\"The parties properly agree that the subjective intent of the law enforcement officer is irrelevant in determining whether that officer's actions violate the Fourth Amendment . . .; the issue is not his state of mind, but the objective effect of his actions\"); <i>Whren</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 517 U. S. 806, 813 (1996) (\"[W]e have been unwilling to entertain Fourth Amendment challenges based on the actual motivations of individual officers\"); <i>Graham</i> v. <i>Connor,</i> 490 U. S. 386, 397 (1989) (\"[O]ur prior cases make clear\" that \"the subjective motivations of the individual officers . . . ha[ve] no bearing on whether a particular seizure is `unreasonable' under the Fourth Amendment\"). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*405</span> It therefore does not matter here\u0097even if their subjective motives could be so neatly unraveled\u0097whether the officers entered the kitchen to arrest respondents and gather evidence against them or to assist the injured and prevent further violence.</p>\n<p>As respondents note, we have held in the context of programmatic searches conducted without individualized suspicion\u0097such as checkpoints to combat drunk driving or drug trafficking\u0097that \"an inquiry into <i>programmatic</i> purpose\" is sometimes appropriate. <i>Indianapolis</i> v. <i>Edmond,</i> 531 U. S. 32, 46 (2000) (emphasis added); see also <i>Florida</i> v. <i>Wells,</i> 495 U. S. 1, 4 (1990) (an inventory search must be regulated by \"standardized criteria\" or \"established routine\" so as not to \"be a ruse for a general rummaging in order to discover incriminating evidence\"). But this inquiry is directed at ensuring that the purpose behind the <i>program</i> is not \"ultimately indistinguishable from the general interest in crime control.\" <i>Edmond,</i> 531 U. S., at 44. It has nothing to do with discerning what is in the mind of the individual officer conducting the search. <i>Id.,</i> at 48.</p>\n<p>Respondents further contend that their conduct was not serious enough to justify the officers' intrusion into the home. They rely on <i>Welsh</i> v. <i>Wisconsin,</i> 466 U. S. 740, 753 (1984), in which we held that \"an important factor to be considered when determining whether any exigency exists is the gravity of the underlying offense for which the arrest is being made.\" This contention, too, is misplaced. <i>Welsh</i> involved a warrantless entry by officers to arrest a suspect for driving while intoxicated. There, the \"only potential emergency\" confronting the officers was the need to preserve evidence (<i>i. e.,</i> the suspect's blood-alcohol level)\u0097an exigency that we held insufficient under the circumstances to justify entry into the suspect's home. <i>Ibid.</i> Here, the officers were confronted with <i>ongoing</i> violence occurring <i>within</i> the home. <i>Welsh</i> did not address such a situation.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*406</span> We think the officers' entry here was plainly reasonable under the circumstances. The officers were responding, at 3 o'clock in the morning, to complaints about a loud party. As they approached the house, they could hear from within \"an altercation occurring, some kind of a fight.\" App. 29. \"It was loud and it was tumultuous.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 33. The officers heard \"thumping and crashing\" and people yelling \"stop, stop\" and \"get off me.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 28, 29. As the trial court found, \"it was obvious that . . . knocking on the front door\" would have been futile. <i>Id.,</i> at 92. The noise seemed to be coming from the back of the house; after looking in the front window and seeing nothing, the officers proceeded around back to investigate further. They found two juveniles drinking beer in the backyard. From there, they could see that a fracas was taking place inside the kitchen. A juvenile, fists clenched, was being held back by several adults. As the officers watch, he breaks free and strikes one of the adults in the face, sending the adult to the sink spitting blood.</p>\n<p>In these circumstances, the officers had an objectively reasonable basis for believing both that the injured adult might need help and that the violence in the kitchen was just beginning. Nothing in the Fourth Amendment required them to wait until another blow rendered someone \"unconscious\" or \"semi-conscious\" or worse before entering. The role of a peace officer includes preventing violence and restoring order, not simply rendering first aid to casualties; an officer is not like a boxing (or hockey) referee, poised to stop a bout only if it becomes too one-sided.</p>\n<p>The manner of the officers' entry was also reasonable. After witnessing the punch, one of the officers opened the screen door and \"yelled in police.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 40. When nobody heard him, he stepped into the kitchen and announced himself again. Only then did the tumult subside. The officer's announcement of his presence was at least equivalent to a knock on the screen door. Indeed, it was probably the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*407</span> only option that had even a chance of rising above the din. Under these circumstances, there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment's knock-and-announce rule. Furthermore, once the announcement was made, the officers were free to enter; it would serve no purpose to require them to stand dumbly at the door awaiting a response while those within brawled on, oblivious to their presence.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Utah, and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring.</p>\n<p>This is an odd flyspeck of a case. The charges that have been pending against respondents for the past six years are minor offenses\u0097intoxication, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and disorderly conduct\u0097two of which could have been proved by evidence that was gathered by the responding officers before they entered the home. The maximum punishment for these crimes ranges between 90 days and 6 months in jail. And the Court's unanimous opinion restating well-settled rules of federal law is so clearly persuasive that it is hard to imagine the outcome was ever in doubt.</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, the only difficult question is which of the following is the most peculiar: (1) that the Utah trial judge, the intermediate state appellate court, and the Utah Supreme Court all found a Fourth Amendment violation on these facts; (2) that the prosecution chose to pursue this matter all the way to the United States Supreme Court; or (3) that this Court voted to grant the petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p>A possible explanation for the first is that the suppression ruling was correct as a matter of Utah law, and neither trial counsel nor the trial judge bothered to identify the Utah Constitution as an independent basis for the decision because <span class=\"star-pagination\">*408</span> they did not expect the prosecution to appeal.<sup>[*]</sup> The most plausible explanation for the latter two decisions is that they were made so police officers in Utah may enter a home without a warrant when they see ongoing violence\u0097we are, of course, reversing the Utah Supreme Court's conclusion to the contrary. But that purpose, laudable though it may be, cannot be achieved in this case. Our holding today addresses only the limitations placed by the Federal Constitution on the search at issue; we have no authority to decide whether the police in this case violated the Utah Constitution.</p>\n<p>The Utah Supreme Court, however, has made clear that the Utah Constitution provides greater protection to the privacy of the home than does the Fourth Amendment. See <i>State</i> v. <i>DeBooy,</i> 2000 UT 32, \u00b6 12, 996 P. 2d 546, 549. And it complained in this case of respondents' failure to raise or adequately brief a state constitutional challenge, thus preventing the state courts from deciding the case on anything other than Fourth Amendment grounds. See 2005 UT 13, \u00b6 12, 122 P. 3d 506, 510. \"[S]urpris[ed]\" by \"[t]he reluctance of litigants to take up and develop a state constitutional analysis,\" <i>ibid.,</i> the court expressly invited future litigants to bring challenges under the Utah Constitution to enable it to fulfill its \"responsibility as guardians of the individual liberty of our citizens\" and \"undertak[e] a principled exploration of the interplay between federal and state protections of individual rights,\" <i>id.,</i> at 511. The fact that this admonishment and request came from the Utah Supreme Court in this very case not only demonstrates that the prosecution selected the wrong case for establishing the rule it wants, but also indicates that the Utah Supreme Court would probably adopt the same rule as a matter of state constitutional law that we reject today under the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*409</span> Whether or not that forecast is accurate, I can see no reason for this Court to cause the Utah courts to redecide the question as a matter of state law. Federal interests are not offended when a single State elects to provide greater protection for its citizens than the Federal Constitution requires. Indeed, I continue to believe \"that a policy of judicial restraint\u0097one that allows other decisional bodies to have the last word in legal interpretation until it is truly necessary for this Court to intervene\u0097enables this Court to make its most effective contribution to our federal system of government.\" <i>Michigan</i> v. <i>Long,</i> 463 U. S. 1032, 1067 (1983) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Thus, while I join the Court's opinion, I remain persuaded that my vote to deny the State's petition for certiorari was correct.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for the State of Michigan et al. by <i>Michael A.

Argued April 24, 2006\u2014Decided May 22, 2006\nResponding to a 3 a.m. call about a loud party, police arrived at the\n  house in question, heard shouting inside, proceeded down the drive\n  way, and saw two juveniles drinking beer in the backyard. Entering\n  the yard, they saw through a screen door and windows an altercation\n  in the kitchen between four adults and a juvenile, who punched one\n  of the adults, causing him to spit blood in a sink. An officer opened\n  the screen door and announced the officers\u2019 presence. Unnoticed\n  amid the tumult, the officer entered the kitchen and again cried out,\n  whereupon the altercation gradually subsided. The officers arrested\n  respondents and charged them with contributing to the delinquency\n  of a minor and related offenses. The trial court granted their motion\n  to suppress all evidence obtained after the officers entered the home\n  on the ground that the warrantless entry violated the Fourth\n  Amendment, and the Utah Court of Appeals affirmed. Affirming, the\n  State Supreme Court held that the injury caused by the juvenile\u2019s\n  punch was insufficient to trigger the \u201cemergency aid doctrine\u201d be\n  cause it did not give rise to an objectively reasonable belief that an\n  unconscious, semiconscious, or missing person feared injured or dead\n  was in the home. Furthermore, the court suggested the doctrine was\n  inapplicable because the officers had not sought to assist the injured\n  adult but had acted exclusively in a law enforcement capacity. The\n  court also held that the entry did not fall within the exigent circum\n  stances exception to the warrant requirement.\nHeld: Police may enter a home without a warrant when they have an\n objectively reasonable basis for believing that an occupant is seri\n ously injured or imminently threatened with such injury.\n    Because the Fourth Amendment\u2019s ultimate touchstone is \u201creason\n  ableness,\u201d the warrant requirement is subject to certain exceptions.\n  For example, one exigency obviating the requirement is the need to\n2                      BRIGHAM CITY v.

Arizona,\n    437 U. S. 385, 392. This Court has repeatedly rejected respondents\u2019\n    contention that, in assessing the reasonableness of an entry, consid\n    eration should be given to the subjective motivations of individual of\n    ficers. Because the officers\u2019 subjective motivation is irrelevant, Bond\n    v. United States, 529 U. S. 334, 338, n. 2, it does not matter here\n    whether they entered the kitchen to arrest respondents and gather\n    evidence or to assist the injured and prevent further violence. Indi\n    anapolis v. Edmond, 531 U. S. 32, 46, and Florida v. Wells, 495 U. S.\n    1, 4, distinguished. Relying on this Court\u2019s holding in Welsh v. Wis\n    consin, 466 U. S. 740, 753, that \u201can important factor to be considered\n    when determining whether any exigency exists is the gravity of the\n    underlying offense for which the arrest is being made,\u201d respondents\n    further contend that their conduct was not serious enough to justify\n    the officers\u2019 intrusion into the home. This contention is misplaced.\n    In Welsh, the \u201conly potential emergency\u201d confronting the officers was\n    the need to preserve evidence of the suspect\u2019s blood-alcohol level, an\n    exigency the Court held insufficient under the circumstances to jus\n    tify a warrantless entry into the suspect\u2019s home. Ibid. Here, the offi\n    cers were confronted with ongoing violence occurring within the\n    home, a situation Welsh did not address.\n       The officers\u2019 entry here was plainly reasonable under the circum\n    stances. Given the tumult at the house when they arrived, it was ob\n    vious that knocking on the front door would have been futile. More\n    over, in light of the fracas they observed in the kitchen, the officers\n    had an objectively reasonable basis for believing both that the injured\n    adult might need help and that the violence was just beginning.\n    Nothing in the Fourth Amendment required them to wait until an\n    other blow rendered someone unconscious, semiconscious, or worse\n    before entering. The manner of their entry was also reasonable, since\n    nobody heard the first announcement of their presence, and it was\n    only after the announcing officer stepped into the kitchen and an\n    nounced himself again that the tumult subsided. That announce\n    ment was at least equivalent to a knock on the screen door and, un\n    der the circumstances, there was no violation of the Fourth\n    Amendment\u2019s knock-and-announce rule.

We\nconclude that they may.\n                              I\n  This case arises out of a melee that occurred in a Brig-\nham City, Utah, home in the early morning hours of July\n23, 2000. At about 3 a.m., four police officers responded to\na call regarding a loud party at a residence. Upon arriving\nat the house, they heard shouting from inside, and pro\nceeded down the driveway to investigate. There, they\nobserved two juveniles drinking beer in the backyard.\nThey entered the backyard, and saw\u2014through a screen\ndoor and windows\u2014an altercation taking place in the\nkitchen of the home. According to the testimony of one of\nthe officers, four adults were attempting, with some diffi\nculty, to restrain a juvenile. The juvenile eventually\n\u201cbroke free, swung a fist and struck one of the adults in\nthe face.\u201d 2005 UT 13, \u00b62, 122 P. 3d 506, 508. The officer\n2                 BRIGHAM CITY v. STUART\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntestified that he observed the victim of the blow spitting\nblood into a nearby sink. App. 40. The other adults con\ntinued to try to restrain the juvenile, pressing him up\nagainst a refrigerator with such force that the refrigerator\nbegan moving across the floor. At this point, an officer\nopened the screen door and announced the officers\u2019 pres\nence. Amid the tumult, nobody noticed. The officer en\ntered the kitchen and again cried out, and as the occu\npants slowly became aware that the police were on the\nscene, the altercation ceased.\n   The officers subsequently arrested respondents and\ncharged them with contributing to the delinquency of a\nminor, disorderly conduct, and intoxication. In the trial\ncourt, respondents filed a motion to suppress all evidence\nobtained after the officers entered the home, arguing that\nthe warrantless entry violated the Fourth Amendment.\nThe court granted the motion, and the Utah Court of\nAppeals affirmed.\n   Before the Supreme Court of Utah, Brigham City ar\ngued that although the officers lacked a warrant, their\nentry was nevertheless reasonable on either of two\ngrounds. The court rejected both contentions and, over\ntwo dissenters, affirmed. First, the court held that the\ninjury caused by the juvenile\u2019s punch was insufficient to\ntrigger the so-called \u201cemergency aid doctrine\u201d because it\ndid not give rise to an \u201c objectively reasonable belief that\nan unconscious, semi-conscious, or missing person feared\ninjured or dead [was] in the home.\u201d 122 P. 3d, at 513\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, the\ncourt suggested that the doctrine was inapplicable because\nthe officers had not sought to assist the injured adult, but\ninstead had acted \u201cexclusively in their law enforcement\ncapacity.\u201d Ibid.\n   The court also held that the entry did not fall within the\nexigent circumstances exception to the warrant require\nment. This exception applies, the court explained, where\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npolice have probable cause and where \u201ca reasonable per\nson [would] believe that the entry was necessary to pre\nvent physical harm to the officers or other persons.\u201d Id.,\nat 514 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under this\nstandard, the court stated, the potential harm need not be\nas serious as that required to invoke the emergency aid\nexception. Although it found the case \u201ca close and difficult\ncall,\u201d the court nevertheless concluded that the officers\u2019\nentry was not justified by exigent circumstances. Id., at\n515.\n   We granted certiorari, 546 U. S. ___ (2006), in light of\ndifferences among state courts and the Courts of Appeals\nconcerning the appropriate Fourth Amendment standard\ngoverning warrantless entry by law enforcement in an\nemergency situation. Compare In re Sealed Case 96\u20133167,\n153 F. 3d 759, 766 (CADC 1998) (\u201c[T]he standard for\nexigent circumstances is an objective one\u201d) and People v.\nHebert, 46 P. 3d 473, 480 (Colo. 2002) (en banc) (consider\ning the circumstances as they \u201cwould have been objec\ntively examined by a prudent and trained police officer\u201d),\nwith United States v. Cervantes, 219 F. 3d 882, 890 (CA9\n2000) (\u201c[U]nder the emergency doctrine, \u2018[a] search must\nnot be primarily motivated by intent to arrest and seize\nevidence\u2019 \u201d (quoting People v. Mitchell, 39 N. Y. 2d 173,\n177, 347 N. E. 2d 607, 609 (1976)) and State v. Mountford,\n171 Vt. 487, 492, 769 A. 2d 639, 645 (2000) (Mitchell test\n\u201crequir[es] courts to find that the primary subjective moti\nvation behind such searches was to provide emergency\naid\u201d).\n                                II\n  It is a \u201c \u2018 basic principle of Fourth Amendment law that\nsearches and seizures inside a home without a warrant\nare presumptively unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d Groh v.

STUART\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nNevertheless, because the ultimate touchstone of the\nFourth Amendment is \u201creasonableness,\u201d the warrant\nrequirement is subject to certain exceptions. Flippo v.\nWest Virginia, 528 U. S. 11, 13 (1999) (per curiam); Katz v.\nUnited States, 389 U. S. 347, 357 (1967). We have held, for\nexample, that law enforcement officers may make a war\nrantless entry onto private property to fight a fire and\ninvestigate its cause, Michigan v. Tyler, 436 U. S. 499, 509\n(1978), to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence,\nKer v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 40 (1963), or to engage in\n\u201chot pursuit\u201d of a fleeing suspect, United States v. Santana,\n427 U. S. 38, 42\u201343 (1976). \u201c[W]arrants are generally re\nquired to search a person\u2019s home or his person unless \u2018the\nexigencies of the situation\u2019 make the needs of law enforce\nment so compelling that the warrantless search is objec\ntively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Mincey v.\nArizona, 437 U. S. 385, 393\u2013394 (1978).\n   One exigency obviating the requirement of a warrant is\nthe need to assist persons who are seriously injured or\nthreatened with such injury. \u201c \u2018The need to protect or\npreserve life or avoid serious injury is justification for\nwhat would be otherwise illegal absent an exigency or\nemergency.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 392 (quoting Wayne v. United States,\n318 F. 2d 205, 212 (CADC 1963) (Burger, J.)); see also\nTyler, supra, at 509. Accordingly, law enforcement officers\nmay enter a home without a warrant to render emergency\nassistance to an injured occupant or to protect an occupant\nfrom imminent injury. Mincey, supra, at 392; see also\nGeorgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. ___, ___ (2006) (slip op., at\n13\u201314) (\u201c[I]t would be silly to suggest that the police would\ncommit a tort by entering . . . to determine whether vio\nlence (or threat of violence) has just occurred or is about to\n(or soon will) occur\u201d).\n   Respondents do not take issue with these principles, but\ninstead advance two reasons why the officers\u2019 entry here\nwas unreasonable. First, they argue that the officers were\n                  Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmore interested in making arrests than quelling violence.\nThey urge us to consider, in assessing the reasonableness\nof the entry, whether the officers were \u201cindeed motivated\nprimarily by a desire to save lives and property.\u201d Brief for\nRespondents 3; see also Brief for National Association of\nCriminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 6 (entry to\nrender emergency assistance justifies a search \u201conly when\nthe searching officer is acting outside his traditional law-\nenforcement capacity\u201d). The Utah Supreme Court also\nconsidered the officers\u2019 subjective motivations relevant.\nSee 122 P. 3d, at 513 (search under the \u201cemergency aid\ndoctrine\u201d may not be \u201cprimarily motivated by intent to\narrest and seize evidence\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n   Our cases have repeatedly rejected this approach. An\naction is \u201creasonable\u201d under the Fourth Amendment,\nregardless of the individual officer\u2019s state of mind, \u201cas long\nas the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify [the]\naction.\u201d Scott v. United States, 436 U. S. 128, 138 (1978)\n(emphasis added). The officer\u2019s subjective motivation is\nirrelevant. See Bond v. United States, 529 U. S. 334, 338,\nn. 2 (2000) (\u201cThe parties properly agree that the subjective\nintent of the law enforcement officer is irrelevant in deter\nmining whether that officer\u2019s actions violate the Fourth\nAmendment . . . ; the issue is not his state of mind, but the\nobjective effect of his actions\u201d); Whren v. United States, 517\nU. S. 806, 813 (1996) (\u201c[W]e have been unwilling to enter\ntain Fourth Amendment challenges based on the actual\nmotivations of individual officers\u201d); Graham v. Connor, 490\nU. S. 386, 397 (1989) (\u201c[O]ur prior cases make clear\u201d that\n\u201cthe subjective motivations of the individual officers . . .\nha[ve] no bearing on whether a particular seizure is \u2018unrea\nsonable\u2019 under the Fourth Amendment\u201d). It therefore does\nnot matter here\u2014even if their subjective motives could be\nso neatly unraveled\u2014whether the officers entered the\nkitchen to arrest respondents and gather evidence against\n6                BRIGHAM CITY v. STUART\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthem or to assist the injured and prevent further violence.\n   As respondents note, we have held in the context of\nprogrammatic searches conducted without individualized\nsuspicion\u2014such as checkpoints to combat drunk driving or\ndrug trafficking\u2014that \u201can inquiry into programmatic\npurpose\u201d is sometimes appropriate. Indianapolis v. Ed\nmond, 531 U. S. 32, 46 (2000) (emphasis added); see also\nFlorida v. Wells, 495 U. S. 1, 4 (1990) (an inventory search\nmust be regulated by \u201cstandardized criteria\u201d or \u201cestablished\nroutine\u201d so as not to \u201cbe a ruse for a general rummaging in\norder to discover incriminating evidence\u201d). But this inquiry\nis directed at ensuring that the purpose behind the pro\ngram is not \u201cultimately indistinguishable from the general\ninterest in crime control.\u201d Edmond, 531 U. S., at 44. It\nhas nothing to do with discerning what is in the mind of\nthe individual officer conducting the search. Id., at 48.\n   Respondents further contend that their conduct was not\nserious enough to justify the officers\u2019 intrusion into the\nhome. They rely on Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740, 753\n(1984), in which we held that \u201can important factor to be\nconsidered when determining whether any exigency exists\nis the gravity of the underlying offense for which the\narrest is being made.\u201d This contention, too, is misplaced.\nWelsh involved a warrantless entry by officers to arrest a\nsuspect for driving while intoxicated. There, the \u201conly\npotential emergency\u201d confronting the officers was the need\nto preserve evidence (i.e., the suspect\u2019s blood-alcohol\nlevel)\u2014an exigency that we held insufficient under the\ncircumstances to justify entry into the suspect\u2019s home.\nIbid. Here, the officers were confronted with ongoing\nviolence occurring within the home. Welsh did not address\nsuch a situation.\n   We think the officers\u2019 entry here was plainly reasonable\nunder the circumstances. The officers were responding, at\n3 o\u2019clock in the morning, to complaints about a loud party.\nAs they approached the house, they could hear from\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwithin \u201can altercation occurring, some kind of a fight.\u201d\nApp. 29. \u201cIt was loud and it was tumultuous.\u201d Id., at 33.\nThe officers heard \u201cthumping and crashing\u201d and people\nyelling \u201cstop, stop\u201d and \u201cget off me.\u201d Id., at 28, 29. As the\ntrial court found, \u201cit was obvious that . . . knocking on the\nfront door\u201d would have been futile. Id., at 92. The noise\nseemed to be coming from the back of the house; after\nlooking in the front window and seeing nothing, the offi\ncers proceeded around back to investigate further. They\nfound two juveniles drinking beer in the backyard. From\nthere, they could see that a fracas was taking place inside\nthe kitchen. A juvenile, fists clenched, was being held\nback by several adults. As the officers watch, he breaks\nfree and strikes one of the adults in the face, sending the\nadult to the sink spitting blood.\n   In these circumstances, the officers had an objectively\nreasonable basis for believing both that the injured adult\nmight need help and that the violence in the kitchen was\njust beginning. Nothing in the Fourth Amendment re\nquired them to wait until another blow rendered someone\n\u201cunconscious\u201d or \u201csemi-conscious\u201d or worse before enter\ning. The role of a peace officer includes preventing vio\nlence and restoring order, not simply rendering first aid to\ncasualties; an officer is not like a boxing (or hockey) refe\nree, poised to stop a bout only if it becomes too one-sided.\n   The manner of the officers\u2019 entry was also reasonable.\nAfter witnessing the punch, one of the officers opened the\nscreen door and \u201cyelled in police.\u201d Id., at 40. When no\nbody heard him, he stepped into the kitchen and an\nnounced himself again. Only then did the tumult subside.\nThe officer\u2019s announcement of his presence was at least\nequivalent to a knock on the screen door. Indeed, it was\nprobably the only option that had even a chance of rising\nabove the din. Under these circumstances, there was no\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s knock-and-announce\nrule. Furthermore, once the announcement was made, the\n8                BRIGHAM CITY v. STUART\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nofficers were free to enter; it would serve no purpose to\nrequire them to stand dumbly at the door awaiting a\nresponse while those within brawled on, oblivious to their\npresence.\n  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Supreme\nCourt of Utah, and remand the case for further proceed\nings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 547 U.

The charges that have\nbeen pending against respondents for the past six years\nare minor offenses\u2014intoxication, contributing to the de\nlinquency of a minor, and disorderly conduct\u2014two of\nwhich could have been proved by evidence that was gath\nered by the responding officers before they entered the\nhome. The maximum punishment for these crimes ranges\nbetween 90 days and 6 months in jail. And the Court\u2019s\nunanimous opinion restating well-settled rules of federal\nlaw is so clearly persuasive that it is hard to imagine the\noutcome was ever in doubt.\n   Under these circumstances, the only difficult question is\nwhich of the following is the most peculiar: (1) that the\nUtah trial judge, the intermediate state appellate court,\nand the Utah Supreme Court all found a Fourth Amend\nment violation on these facts; (2) that the prosecution\nchose to pursue this matter all the way to the United\nStates Supreme Court; or (3) that this Court voted to\ngrant the petition for a writ of certiorari.\n   A possible explanation for the first is that the suppres\nsion ruling was correct as a matter of Utah law, and nei\nther trial counsel nor the trial judge bothered to identify\nthe Utah Constitution as an independent basis for the\ndecision because they did not expect the prosecution to\n2                    BRIGHAM CITY v. STUART\n\n                        STEVENS, J., concurring\n\nappeal.* The most plausible explanation for the latter two\ndecisions is that they were made so police officers in Utah\nmay enter a home without a warrant when they see ongo\ning violence\u2014we are, of course, reversing the Utah Su\npreme Court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary. But that pur\npose, laudable though it may be, cannot be achieved in\nthis case. Our holding today addresses only the limita\ntions placed by the Federal Constitution on the search at\nissue; we have no authority to decide whether the police in\nthis case violated the Utah Constitution.\n   The Utah Supreme Court, however, has made clear that\nthe Utah Constitution provides greater protection to the\nprivacy of the home than does the Fourth Amendment.\nSee State v. Debooy, 2000 UT 32, \u00b612, 996 P. 2d 546, 549.\nAnd it complained in this case of respondents\u2019 failure to\nraise or adequately brief a state constitutional challenge,\nthus preventing the state courts from deciding the case on\nanything other than Fourth Amendment grounds. See\n2005 UT 13, \u00b612, 122 P. 3d 506, 510. \u201c[S]urpris[ed]\u201d by\n\u201c[t]he reluctance of litigants to take up and develop a state\nconstitutional analysis,\u201d ibid., the court expressly invited\nfuture litigants to bring challenges under the Utah Consti\ntution to enable it to fulfill its \u201cresponsibility as guardians\nof the individual liberty of our citizens\u201d and \u201cundertak[e] a\nprincipled exploration of the interplay between federal and\nstate protections of individual rights,\u201d id., at 511. The fact\nthat this admonishment and request came from the Utah\nSupreme Court in this very case not only demonstrates\nthat the prosecution selected the wrong case for establish\ning the rule it wants, but indicates that the Utah Supreme\nCourt would probably adopt the same rule as a matter of\nstate constitutional law that we reject today under the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Indeed, it was the prosecution that prepared the trial court\u2019s order\ngranting respondents\u2019 motion to suppress.

Federal interests\nare not offended when a single State elects to provide\ngreater protection for its citizens than the Federal Consti\ntution requires. Indeed, I continue to believe \u201cthat a policy\nof judicial restraint\u2014one that allows other decisional\nbodies to have the last word in legal interpretation until it\nis truly necessary for this Court to intervene\u2014enables this\nCourt to make its most effective contribution to our federal\nsystem of government.\u201d Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032,\n1067 (1983) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).

At this point, an officer opened the screen door and announced the officers' presence. Amid the tumult, nobody noticed. The officer entered the kitchen and again cried out, and as the occupants slowly became aware that the police were on the scene, the altercation ceased.</p>\n<p>The officers subsequently arrested respondents and charged them with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, disorderly conduct, and intoxication. In the trial court, respondents filed a motion to suppress all evidence obtained after the officers entered the home, arguing that the warrantless entry violated the Fourth Amendment. The court granted the motion, and the Utah Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p>Before the Supreme Court of Utah, Brigham City argued that although the officers lacked a warrant, their entry was nevertheless reasonable on either of two grounds. The court rejected both contentions and, over two dissenters, affirmed. First, the court held that the injury caused by the juvenile's punch was insufficient to trigger the so-called \"emergency aid doctrine\" because it did not give rise to an \"objectively reasonable belief that an unconscious, semiconscious, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*402</span> or missing person feared injured or dead [was] in the home.\" 122 P. 3d, at 513 (internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, the court suggested that the doctrine was inapplicable because the officers had not sought to assist the injured adult, but instead had acted \"exclusively in their law enforcement capacity.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The court also held that the entry did not fall within the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement. This exception applies, the court explained, where police have probable cause and where \"a reasonable person [would] believe that the entry was necessary to prevent physical harm to the officers or other persons.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 514 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under this standard, the court stated, the potential harm need not be as serious as that required to invoke the emergency aid exception. Although it found the case \"a close and difficult call,\" the court nevertheless concluded that the officers' entry was not justified by exigent circumstances. <i>Id.,</i> at 515.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 546 U. S. 1085 (2006), in light of differences among state courts and the Courts of Appeals concerning the appropriate Fourth Amendment standard governing warrantless entry by law enforcement in an emergency situation. Compare <i>In re Sealed Case 96-3167,</i> 153 F. 3d 759, 766 (CADC 1998) (\"[T]he standard for exigent circumstances is an objective one\"), and <i>People</i> v. <i>Hebert,</i> 46 P. 3d 473, 480 (Colo. 2002) (en banc) (considering the circumstances as they \"would have been objectively examined by a prudent and trained police officer\"), with <i>United States</i> v. <i>Cervantes,</i> 219 F. 3d 882, 890 (CA9 2000) (\"[U]nder the emergency doctrine, `[a] search must not be primarily motivated by intent to arrest and seize evidence'\" (quoting <i>People</i> v. <i>Mitchell,</i> 39 N. Y. 2d 173, 177, 347 N. E. 2d 607, 609 (1976)), and <i>State</i> v. <i>Mountford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2310659\"><a href=\"/opinion/2310659/state-v-mountford/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vt.</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></a></span>, 492, 769 A. 2d 639, 645 (2000) (<i>Mitchell</i> test \"requir[es] courts to find that the primary subjective motivation behind such searches was to provide emergency aid\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*403</span> II</h2>\n<p>It is a \"`basic principle of Fourth Amendment law that searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable.'\" <i>Groh</i> v. <i>Ramirez,</i> 540 U. S. 551, 559 (2004) (quoting <i>Payton</i> v. <i>New York,</i> 445 U. S. 573, 586 (1980); some internal quotation marks omitted). Nevertheless, because the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is \"reasonableness,\" the warrant requirement is subject to certain exceptions. <i>Flippo</i> v. <i>West Virginia,</i> 528 U. S. 11, 13 (1999) (<i>per curiam</i>); <i>Katz</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 389 U. S. 347, 357 (1967). We have held, for example, that law enforcement officers may make a warrantless entry onto private property to fight a fire and investigate its cause, <i>Michigan</i> v. <i>Tyler,</i> 436 U. S. 499, 509 (1978), to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence, <i>Ker</i> v. <i>California,</i> 374 U. S. 23, 40 (1963) (plurality opinion), or to engage in \"`hot pursuit'\" of a fleeing suspect, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Santana,</i> 427 U. S. 38, 42, 43 (1976). \"[W]arrants are generally required to search a person's home or his person unless `the exigencies of the situation' make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that the warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\" <i>Mincey</i> v. <i>Arizona,</i> 437 U. S. 385, 393-394 (1978).</p>\n<p>One exigency obviating the requirement of a warrant is the need to assist persons who are seriously injured or threatened with such injury. \"`The need to protect or preserve life or avoid serious injury is justification for what would be otherwise illegal absent an exigency or emergency.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 392 (quoting <i>Wayne</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 318 F. 2d 205, 212 (CADC 1963) (Burger, J.)); see also <i>Tyler, supra,</i> at 509. Accordingly, law enforcement officers may enter a home without a warrant to render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or to protect an occupant from imminent injury. <i>Mincey, supra,</i> at 392; see also <i>Georgia</i> v. <i>Randolph, ante,</i> at 118 (\"[I]t would be silly to suggest that the police would commit a tort by entering . . . to determine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*404</span> whether violence (or threat of violence) has just occurred or is about to (or soon will) occur\").</p>\n<p>Respondents do not take issue with these principles, but instead advance two reasons why the officers' entry here was unreasonable. First, they argue that the officers were more interested in making arrests than quelling violence. They urge us to consider, in assessing the reasonableness of the entry, whether the officers were \"indeed motivated primarily by a desire to save lives and property.\" Brief for Respondents 3; see also Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 6 (entry to render emergency assistance justifies a search \"only when the searching officer is acting outside his traditional law-enforcement capacity\"). The Utah Supreme Court also considered the officers' subjective motivations relevant. See 122 P. 3d, at 513 (search under the \"emergency aid doctrine\" may not be \"primarily motivated by intent to arrest and seize evidence\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>Our cases have repeatedly rejected this approach. An action is \"reasonable\" under the Fourth Amendment, regardless of the individual officer's state of mind, \"as long as the circumstances, viewed <i>objectively,</i> justify [the] action.\" <i>Scott</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 436 U. S. 128, 138 (1978) (emphasis added). The officer's subjective motivation is irrelevant. See <i>Bond</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 529 U. S. 334, 338, n. 2 (2000) (\"The parties properly agree that the subjective intent of the law enforcement officer is irrelevant in determining whether that officer's actions violate the Fourth Amendment . . .; the issue is not his state of mind, but the objective effect of his actions\"); <i>Whren</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 517 U. S. 806, 813 (1996) (\"[W]e have been unwilling to entertain Fourth Amendment challenges based on the actual motivations of individual officers\"); <i>Graham</i> v. <i>Connor,</i> 490 U. S. 386, 397 (1989) (\"[O]ur prior cases make clear\" that \"the subjective motivations of the individual officers . . . ha[ve] no bearing on whether a particular seizure is `unreasonable' under the Fourth Amendment\"). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*405</span> It therefore does not matter here\u0097even if their subjective motives could be so neatly unraveled\u0097whether the officers entered the kitchen to arrest respondents and gather evidence against them or to assist the injured and prevent further violence.</p>\n<p>As respondents note, we have held in the context of programmatic searches conducted without individualized suspicion\u0097such as checkpoints to combat drunk driving or drug trafficking\u0097that \"an inquiry into <i>programmatic</i> purpose\" is sometimes appropriate. <i>Indianapolis</i> v. <i>Edmond,</i> 531 U. S. 32, 46 (2000) (emphasis added); see also <i>Florida</i> v. <i>Wells,</i> 495 U. S. 1, 4 (1990) (an inventory search must be regulated by \"standardized criteria\" or \"established routine\" so as not to \"be a ruse for a general rummaging in order to discover incriminating evidence\"). But this inquiry is directed at ensuring that the purpose behind the <i>program</i> is not \"ultimately indistinguishable from the general interest in crime control.\" <i>Edmond,</i> 531 U. S., at 44. It has nothing to do with discerning what is in the mind of the individual officer conducting the search. <i>Id.,</i> at 48.</p>\n<p>Respondents further contend that their conduct was not serious enough to justify the officers' intrusion into the home. They rely on <i>Welsh</i> v. <i>Wisconsin,</i> 466 U. S. 740, 753 (1984), in which we held that \"an important factor to be considered when determining whether any exigency exists is the gravity of the underlying offense for which the arrest is being made.\" This contention, too, is misplaced. <i>Welsh</i> involved a warrantless entry by officers to arrest a suspect for driving while intoxicated. There, the \"only potential emergency\" confronting the officers was the need to preserve evidence (<i>i. e.,</i> the suspect's blood-alcohol level)\u0097an exigency that we held insufficient under the circumstances to justify entry into the suspect's home. <i>Ibid.</i> Here, the officers were confronted with <i>ongoing</i> violence occurring <i>within</i> the home. <i>Welsh</i> did not address such a situation.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*406</span> We think the officers' entry here was plainly reasonable under the circumstances. The officers were responding, at 3 o'clock in the morning, to complaints about a loud party. As they approached the house, they could hear from within \"an altercation occurring, some kind of a fight.\" App. 29. \"It was loud and it was tumultuous.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 33. The officers heard \"thumping and crashing\" and people yelling \"stop, stop\" and \"get off me.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 28, 29. As the trial court found, \"it was obvious that . . . knocking on the front door\" would have been futile. <i>Id.,</i> at 92. The noise seemed to be coming from the back of the house; after looking in the front window and seeing nothing, the officers proceeded around back to investigate further. They found two juveniles drinking beer in the backyard. From there, they could see that a fracas was taking place inside the kitchen. A juvenile, fists clenched, was being held back by several adults. As the officers watch, he breaks free and strikes one of the adults in the face, sending the adult to the sink spitting blood.</p>\n<p>In these circumstances, the officers had an objectively reasonable basis for believing both that the injured adult might need help and that the violence in the kitchen was just beginning. Nothing in the Fourth Amendment required them to wait until another blow rendered someone \"unconscious\" or \"semi-conscious\" or worse before entering. The role of a peace officer includes preventing violence and restoring order, not simply rendering first aid to casualties; an officer is not like a boxing (or hockey) referee, poised to stop a bout only if it becomes too one-sided.</p>\n<p>The manner of the officers' entry was also reasonable. After witnessing the punch, one of the officers opened the screen door and \"yelled in police.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 40. When nobody heard him, he stepped into the kitchen and announced himself again. Only then did the tumult subside. The officer's announcement of his presence was at least equivalent to a knock on the screen door. Indeed, it was probably the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*407</span> only option that had even a chance of rising above the din. Under these circumstances, there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment's knock-and-announce rule. Furthermore, once the announcement was made, the officers were free to enter; it would serve no purpose to require them to stand dumbly at the door awaiting a response while those within brawled on, oblivious to their presence.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Utah, and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring.</p>\n<p>This is an odd flyspeck of a case. The charges that have been pending against respondents for the past six years are minor offenses\u0097intoxication, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and disorderly conduct\u0097two of which could have been proved by evidence that was gathered by the responding officers before they entered the home. The maximum punishment for these crimes ranges between 90 days and 6 months in jail. And the Court's unanimous opinion restating well-settled rules of federal law is so clearly persuasive that it is hard to imagine the outcome was ever in doubt.</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, the only difficult question is which of the following is the most peculiar: (1) that the Utah trial judge, the intermediate state appellate court, and the Utah Supreme Court all found a Fourth Amendment violation on these facts; (2) that the prosecution chose to pursue this matter all the way to the United States Supreme Court; or (3) that this Court voted to grant the petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p>A possible explanation for the first is that the suppression ruling was correct as a matter of Utah law, and neither trial counsel nor the trial judge bothered to identify the Utah Constitution as an independent basis for the decision because <span class=\"star-pagination\">*408</span> they did not expect the prosecution to appeal.<sup>[*]</sup> The most plausible explanation for the latter two decisions is that they were made so police officers in Utah may enter a home without a warrant when they see ongoing violence\u0097we are, of course, reversing the Utah Supreme Court's conclusion to the contrary. But that purpose, laudable though it may be, cannot be achieved in this case. Our holding today addresses only the limitations placed by the Federal Constitution on the search at issue; we have no authority to decide whether the police in this case violated the Utah Constitution.</p>\n<p>The Utah Supreme Court, however, has made clear that the Utah Constitution provides greater protection to the privacy of the home than does the Fourth Amendment. See <i>State</i> v. <i>DeBooy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1316088\"><a href=\"/opinion/1316088/state-v-debooy/\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">UT</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, \u00b6 12, 996 P. 2d 546, 549. And it complained in this case of respondents' failure to raise or adequately brief a state constitutional challenge, thus preventing the state courts from deciding the case on anything other than Fourth Amendment grounds. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2576420\"><a href=\"/opinion/2576420/brigham-city-v-stuart/\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">UT</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, \u00b6 12, 122 P. 3d 506, 510. \"[S]urpris[ed]\" by \"[t]he reluctance of litigants to take up and develop a state constitutional analysis,\" <i>ibid.,</i> the court expressly invited future litigants to bring challenges under the Utah Constitution to enable it to fulfill its \"responsibility as guardians of the individual liberty of our citizens\" and \"undertak[e] a principled exploration of the interplay between federal and state protections of individual rights,\" <i>id.,</i> at 511. The fact that this admonishment and request came from the Utah Supreme Court in this very case not only demonstrates that the prosecution selected the wrong case for establishing the rule it wants, but also indicates that the Utah Supreme Court would probably adopt the same rule as a matter of state constitutional law that we reject today under the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*409</span> Whether or not that forecast is accurate, I can see no reason for this Court to cause the Utah courts to redecide the question as a matter of state law. Federal interests are not offended when a single State elects to provide greater protection for its citizens than the Federal Constitution requires. Indeed, I continue to believe \"that a policy of judicial restraint\u0097one that allows other decisional bodies to have the last word in legal interpretation until it is truly necessary for this Court to intervene\u0097enables this Court to make its most effective contribution to our federal system of government.\" <i>Michigan</i> v. <i>Long,</i> 463 U. S. 1032, 1067 (1983) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Thus, while I join the Court's opinion, I remain persuaded that my vote to deny the State's petition for certiorari was correct.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for the State of Michigan et al. by <i>Michael A.
