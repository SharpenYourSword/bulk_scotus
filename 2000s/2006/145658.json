S. Army by the Willys-Overland Motor Company in Toledo, Ohio. Nearly 60 years later, the city of Toledo and State of Ohio sought to encourage the current manufacturer of Jeeps\u0097 DaimlerChrysler\u0097to expand its Jeep operation in Toledo, by offering local and state tax benefits for new investment. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*338</span> Taxpayers in Toledo sued, alleging that their local and state tax burdens were increased by the tax breaks for Daimler-Chrysler, tax breaks that they asserted violated the Commerce Clause. The Court of Appeals agreed that a state tax credit offered under Ohio law violated the Commerce Clause, and state and local officials and DaimlerChrysler sought review in this Court. We are obligated before reaching this Commerce Clause question to determine whether the taxpayers who objected to the credit have standing to press their complaint in federal court. We conclude that they do not, and we therefore can proceed no further.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Ohio levies a franchise tax \"upon corporations for the privilege of doing business in the state, owning or using a part or all of its capital or property in [the] state, or holding a certificate of compliance authorizing it to do business in [the] state.\" <i>Wesnovtek Corp.</i> v. <i>Wilkins,</i> 105 Ohio St. 3d 312, 313, 2005-Ohio-1826, \u00b6 2, 825 N. E. 2d 1099, 1100; see Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 5733.01 (Lexis 2005). A taxpayer that purchases \"new manufacturing machinery and equipment\" and installs it at sites in the State receives a credit against the franchise tax. See \u00a7 5733.33(B)(1) (Lexis 1999).<sup>[1]</sup> Municipalities in Ohio may also offer partial property tax waivers to businesses that agree to invest in qualifying areas. See \u00a7 5709.62(C)(1)(a) (Lexis 2005). With consent from local school districts, the partial property tax waiver can be increased to a complete exemption. See \u00a7 5709.62(D)(1).</p>\n<p>In 1998, DaimlerChrysler entered into a contract with the city of Toledo. Under the contract, DaimlerChrysler agreed to expand its Jeep assembly plant at Stickney Avenue in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*339</span> Toledo. In exchange, the city agreed to waive the property tax for the plant, with the consent of the two school districts in which the plant is located. Because DaimlerChrysler undertook to purchase and install \"new manufacturing machinery and equipment,\" it was also entitled to a credit against the state franchise tax. See \u00a7 5733.33(B)(1) (Lexis 1999).</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs filed suit against various state and local officials and DaimlerChrysler in state court, alleging that these tax benefits violated the Commerce Clause. Most of the plaintiffs were residents of Toledo, who paid taxes to both the city of Toledo and State of Ohio. They claimed that they were injured because the tax breaks for DaimlerChrysler diminished the funds available to the city and State, imposing a \"disproportionate burden\" on plaintiffs. App. 18a, 23a, 28a.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Defendants removed the action to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1441. Plaintiffs filed motions to remand the case to state court. See \u00a7 1447(c). One of the grounds on which they sought remand concerned their standing. They professed \"substantial doubts about their ability to satisfy either the constitutional or the prudential limitations on standing in the federal court,\" and urged the District Court to avoid the issue entirely by remanding. Plaintiffs' Supplemental Motion for Remand to State Court in No. 3:00cv7247, p. 13, Record, Doc. 17 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>The District Court declined to remand the case, concluding that, \"[a]t the bare minimum, the Plaintiffs who are taxpayers have standing to object to the property tax exemption <span class=\"star-pagination\">*340</span> and franchise tax credit statutes under the `municipal taxpayer standing' rule articulated in <i>Massachusetts</i> v. <i>Mellon,</i> 262 U. S. 447 (1923).\" App. 78a (citations omitted). On the merits, the District Court found that neither tax benefit violated the Commerce Clause. See 154 F. Supp. 2d 1196 (2001). The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit agreed with the District Court as to the municipal property tax exemption, but held that the state franchise tax credit violated the Commerce Clause. See 386 F. 3d 738 (2004). The Court of Appeals did not address the issue of standing.</p>\n<p>Defendants sought certiorari to review the Sixth Circuit's invalidation of the franchise tax credit and plaintiffs sought certiorari to review the upholding of the property tax exemption. We granted certiorari to consider whether the franchise tax credit violates the Commerce Clause, 545 U. S. 1165 (2005); the Michigan Supreme Court had decided a similar question contrary to the Sixth Circuit's analysis here. See <i>Caterpillar, Inc.</i> v. <i>Department of Treasury,</i> 440 Mich. 400, 488 N. W. 2d 182 (1992). We also asked the parties to address whether plaintiffs have standing to challenge the franchise tax credit in this litigation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We have \"an obligation to assure ourselves\" of litigants' standing under Article III. <i>Friends of Earth, Inc.</i> v. <i>Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.,</i> 528 U. S. 167, 180 (2000). We therefore begin by addressing plaintiffs' claims that they have standing as taxpayers to challenge the franchise tax credit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Chief Justice Marshall, in <i>Marbury</i> v. <i>Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137 (1803), grounded the Federal Judiciary's authority to exercise judicial review and interpret the Constitution on the necessity to do so in the course of carrying out the judicial function of deciding cases. As Marshall explained, \"[t]hose who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound <span class=\"star-pagination\">*341</span> and interpret that rule.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 177. Determining that a matter before the federal courts is a proper case or controversy under Article III therefore assumes particular importance in ensuring that the Federal Judiciary respects \"`the proper\u0097and properly limited\u0097role of the courts in a democratic society,'\" <i>Allen</i> v. <i>Wright,</i> 468 U. S. 737, 750 (1984) (quoting <i>Warth</i> v. <i>Seldin,</i> 422 U. S. 490, 498 (1975)). If a dispute is not a proper case or controversy, the courts have no business deciding it, or expounding the law in the course of doing so.</p>\n<p>This Court has recognized that the case-or-controversy limitation is crucial in maintaining the \"`tripartite allocation of power'\" set forth in the Constitution. <i>Valley Forge Christian College</i> v. <i>Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,</i> 454 U. S. 464, 474 (1982) (quoting <i>Flast</i> v. <i>Cohen,</i> 392 U. S. 83, 95 (1968)). Marshall again made the point early on, this time in a speech in the House of Representatives. \"A case in law or equity,\" Marshall remarked,</p>\n<blockquote>\"was a term . . . of limited signification. It was a controversy between parties which had taken a shape for judicial decision. If the judicial power extended to every <i>question</i> under the constitution it would involve almost every subject proper for legislative discussion and decision; if to every <i>question</i> under the laws and treaties of the United States it would involve almost every subject on which the executive could act. The division of power [among the branches of government] could exist no longer, and the other departments would be swallowed up by the judiciary.\" 4 Papers of John Marshall 95 (C. Cullen ed. 1984).</blockquote>\n<p>As this Court has explained, \"`[n]o principle is more fundamental to the judiciary's proper role in our system of government than the constitutional limitation of federal-court jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies.'\" <i>Raines</i> v. <i>Byrd,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*342</span> 521 U. S. 811, 818 (1997) (quoting <i>Simon</i> v. <i>Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization,</i> 426 U. S. 26, 37 (1976)).</p>\n<p>The case-or-controversy requirement thus plays a critical role, and \"Article III standing . . . enforces the Constitution's case-or-controversy requirement.\" <i>Elk Grove Unified School Dist.</i> v. <i>Newdow,</i> 542 U. S. 1, 11 (2004). The \"core component\" of the requirement that a litigant have standing to invoke the authority of a federal court \"is an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III.\" <i>Lujan</i> v. <i>Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992). The requisite elements of this \"core component derived directly from the Constitution\" are familiar: \"A plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\" <i>Allen, supra,</i> at 751. We have been asked to decide an important question of constitutional law concerning the Commerce Clause. But before we do so, we must find that the question is presented in a \"case\" or \"controversy\" that is, in James Madison's words, \"of a Judiciary Nature.\" 2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 430 (M. Farrand ed. 1966). That requires plaintiffs, as the parties now asserting federal jurisdiction, to carry the burden of establishing their standing under Article III.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs principally claim standing by virtue of their status as Ohio taxpayers, alleging that the franchise tax credit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*343</span> \"depletes the funds of the State of Ohio to which the Plaintiffs contribute through their tax payments\" and thus \"diminish[es] the total funds available for lawful uses and impos[es] disproportionate burdens on\" them. App. 28a; see also Brief for Respondents 24. On several occasions, this Court has denied <i>federal</i> taxpayers standing under Article III to object to a particular expenditure of federal funds simply because they are taxpayers. Thus the alleged \"deprivation of the fair and constitutional use of [a federal taxpayer's] tax dollar\" cannot support a challenge to the conveyance of Government land to a private religious college, <i>Valley Forge, supra,</i> at 476, 482 (internal quotation marks and some brackets omitted), and \"the interest of a taxpayer in the moneys of the federal treasury furnishes no basis\" to argue that a federal agency's loan practices are unconstitutional, <i>Alabama Power Co.</i> v. <i>Ickes,</i> 302 U. S. 464, 478 (1938); see also <i>Schlesinger</i> v. <i>Reservists Comm. to Stop the War,</i> 418 U. S. 208 (1974); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Richardson,</i> 418 U. S. 166 (1974).</p>\n<p>The animating principle behind these cases was announced in their progenitor, <i>Frothingham</i> v. <i>Mellon,</i> decided with <i>Massachusetts</i> v. <i>Mellon,</i> 262 U. S. 447 (1923). In rejecting a claim that improper federal appropriations would \"increase the burden of future taxation and thereby take [the plaintiff's] property without due process of law,\" the Court observed that a federal taxpayer's</p>\n<blockquote>\"interest in the moneys of the Treasury . . . is shared with millions of others; is comparatively minute and indeterminable; and the effect upon future taxation, of any payment out of the funds, so remote, fluctuating and uncertain, that no basis is afforded for an appeal to the preventive powers of a court of equity.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 486, 487.</blockquote>\n<p>This logic is equally applicable to taxpayer challenges to expenditures that deplete the treasury, and to taxpayer challenges to so-called \"tax expenditures,\" which reduce amounts available to the treasury by granting tax credits or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*344</span> exemptions. In either case, the alleged injury is based on the asserted effect of the allegedly illegal activity on public revenues, to which the taxpayer contributes.</p>\n<p>Standing has been rejected in such cases because the alleged injury is not \"concrete and particularized,\" <i>Defenders of Wildlife, supra,</i> at 560, but instead a grievance the taxpayer \"suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally,\" <i>Frothingham, supra,</i> at 488. In addition, the injury is not \"actual or imminent,\" but instead \"conjectural or hypothetical.\" <i>Defenders of Wildlife, supra,</i> at 560 (internal quotation marks omitted). As an initial matter, it is unclear that tax breaks of the sort at issue here do in fact deplete the treasury: The very point of the tax benefits is to spur economic activity, which in turn <i>increases</i> government revenues. In this very action, the Michigan plaintiffs claimed that they were injured because they lost out on the added revenues that would have accompanied Daimler-Chrysler's decision to expand facilities in Michigan. See n. 2, <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' alleged injury is also \"conjectural or hypothetical\" in that it depends on how legislators respond to a reduction in revenue, if that is the consequence of the credit. Establishing injury requires speculating that elected officials will increase a taxpayer-plaintiff's tax bill to make up a deficit; establishing redressability requires speculating that abolishing the challenged credit will redound to the benefit of the taxpayer because legislators will pass along the supposed increased revenue in the form of tax reductions. Neither sort of speculation suffices to support standing. See <i>ASARCO Inc.</i> v. <i>Kadish,</i> 490 U. S. 605, 614 (1989) (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (\"[I]t is pure speculation whether the lawsuit would result in any actual tax relief for respondents\"); <i>Warth,</i> 422 U. S., at 509 (criticizing a taxpayer standing claim for the \"conjectural nature of the asserted injury\").</p>\n<p>A taxpayer plaintiff has no right to insist that the government dispose of any increased revenue it might experience <span class=\"star-pagination\">*345</span> as a result of his suit by decreasing his tax liability or bolstering programs that benefit him. To the contrary, the decision of how to allocate any such savings is the very epitome of a policy judgment committed to the \"broad and legitimate discretion\" of lawmakers, which \"the courts cannot presume either to control or to predict.\" <i>ASARCO, supra,</i> at 615 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). Under such circumstances, we have no assurance that the asserted injury is \"imminent\"\u0097 that it is \"certainly impending.\" <i>Whitmore</i> v. <i>Arkansas,</i> 495 U. S. 149, 158 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted); see <i>Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U. S., at 564-565, n. 2.</p>\n<p>The foregoing rationale for rejecting federal taxpayer standing applies with undiminished force to state taxpayers. We indicated as much in <i>Doremus</i> v. <i>Board of Ed. of Hawthorne,</i> 342 U. S. 429 (1952). In that case, we noted our earlier holdings that \"the interests of a taxpayer in the moneys of the federal treasury are too indeterminable, remote, uncertain and indirect\" to support standing to challenge \"their manner of expenditure.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 433. We then \"reiterate[d]\" what we had said in rejecting a federal taxpayer challenge to a federal statute \"as equally true when a state Act is assailed: `The [taxpayer] must be able to show . . . that he has sustained . . . some direct injury . . . and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 433-434 (quoting <i>Frothingham, supra,</i> at 488); see <i>ASARCO, supra,</i> at 613-614 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (\"[W]e have likened state taxpayers to federal taxpayers\" for purposes of taxpayer standing (citing <i>Doremus, supra,</i> at 434)).</p>\n<p>The allegations of injury that plaintiffs make in their complaint furnish no better basis for finding standing than those made in the cases where federal taxpayer standing was denied. Plaintiffs claim that DaimlerChrysler's tax credit depletes the Ohio fisc and \"impos[es] disproportionate burdens on [them].\" App. 28a. This is no different from similar claims by federal taxpayers we have already rejected under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*346</span> Article III as insufficient to establish standing. See, <i>e. g., Frothingham,</i> 262 U. S., at 486 (allegation of injury that the effect of government spending \"will be to increase the burden of future taxation and thereby take [plaintiff's] property without due process of law\").</p>\n<p>State policymakers, no less than their federal counterparts, retain broad discretion to make \"policy decisions\" concerning state spending \"in different ways . . . depending on their perceptions of wise state fiscal policy and myriad other circumstances.\" <i>ASARCO, supra,</i> at 615 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). Federal courts may not assume a particular exercise of this state fiscal discretion in establishing standing; a party seeking federal jurisdiction cannot rely on such \"[s]peculative inferences . . . to connect [his] injury to the challenged actions of [the defendant],\" <i>Simon,</i> 426 U. S., at 45; see also <i>Allen,</i> 468 U. S., at 759. Indeed, because state budgets frequently contain an array of tax and spending provisions, any number of which may be challenged on a variety of bases, affording state taxpayers standing to press such challenges simply because their tax burden gives them an interest in the state treasury would interpose the federal courts as \"`virtually continuing monitors of the wisdom and soundness'\" of state fiscal administration, contrary to the more modest role Article III envisions for federal courts. See <i>id.,</i> at 760-761 (quoting <i>Laird</i> v. <i>Tatum,</i> 408 U. S. 1, 15 (1972)).</p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we hold that state taxpayers have no standing under Article III to challenge state tax or spending decisions simply by virtue of their status as taxpayers.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*347</span> C</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that an exception to the general prohibition on taxpayer standing should exist for Commerce Clause challenges to state tax or spending decisions, analogizing their Commerce Clause claim to the Establishment Clause challenge we permitted in <i>Flast</i> v. <i>Cohen,</i> 392 U. S. 83. <i>Flast</i> held that because \"the Establishment Clause . . . specifically limit[s] the taxing and spending power conferred by Art. I, \u00a7 8,\" \"a taxpayer will have standing consistent with Article III to invoke federal judicial power when he alleges that congressional action under the taxing and spending clause is in derogation of\" the Establishment Clause. <i>Id.,</i> at 105-106. <i>Flast</i> held out the possibility that \"other specific [constitutional] limitations\" on Article I, \u00a7 8, might surmount the \"barrier to suits against Acts of Congress brought by individuals who can assert only the interest of federal taxpayers.\" 392 U. S., at 105, 85. But as plaintiffs candidly concede, \"only the Establishment Clause\" has supported federal taxpayer suits since <i>Flast.</i> Brief for Respondents 12; see <i>Bowen</i> v. <i>Kendrick,</i> 487 U. S. 589, 618 (1988) (\"Although we have considered the problem of standing and Article III limitations on federal jurisdiction many times since <i>[Flast],</i> we have consistently adhered to <i>Flast</i> and the narrow exception it created to the general rule against taxpayer standing\").</p>\n<p>Quite apart from whether the franchise tax credit is analogous to an exercise of congressional power under Article I, \u00a7 8, plaintiffs' reliance on <i>Flast</i> is misguided: Whatever rights plaintiffs have under the Commerce Clause, they are fundamentally unlike the right not to \"`contribute three pence . . . for the support of any one [religious] establishment.'\" 392 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*348</span> U. S., at 103 (quoting 2 Writings of James Madison 186 (G. Hunt ed. 1901)). Indeed, plaintiffs compare the Establishment Clause to the Commerce Clause at such a high level of generality that almost any constitutional constraint on government power would \"specifically limit\" a State's taxing and spending power for <i>Flast</i> purposes. 392 U. S., at 105; see Brief for Respondents 14 (\"In each case, the harm to be avoided by [the two Clauses] is the loss of governmental neutrality\"). And even if the two Clauses are similar in that they often implicate governments' fiscal decisions, see <i>id.,</i> at 13-14, a finding that the Commerce Clause satisfies the <i>Flast</i> test would leave no principled way of distinguishing those other constitutional provisions that we have recognized constrain governments' taxing and spending decisions, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc.</i> v. <i>Ragland,</i> 481 U. S. 221 (1987) (invalidating state sales tax under the Free Press Clause). Yet such a broad application of <i>Flast</i>'s exception to the general prohibition on taxpayer standing would be quite at odds with its narrow application in our precedent and <i>Flast</i>'s own promise that it would not transform federal courts into forums for taxpayers' \"generalized grievances.\" 392 U. S., at 106.</p>\n<p><i>Flast</i> is consistent with the principle, underlying the Article III prohibition on taxpayer suits, that a litigant may not assume a particular disposition of government funds in establishing standing. The <i>Flast</i> Court discerned in the history of the Establishment Clause \"the specific evils feared by [its drafters] that the taxing and spending power would be used to favor one religion over another or to support religion in general.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 103. The Court therefore understood the \"injury\" alleged in Establishment Clause challenges to federal spending to be the very \"extract[ion] and spen[ding]\" of \"tax money\" in aid of religion alleged by a plaintiff. <i>Id.,</i> at 106. And an injunction against the spending would of course redress <i>that</i> injury, regardless of whether lawmakers would dispose of the savings in a way <span class=\"star-pagination\">*349</span> that would benefit the taxpayer-plaintiffs personally. See <i>Valley Forge,</i> 454 U. S., at 514 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\"[T]he plaintiffs' invocation of the Establishment Clause was of decisive importance in resolving the standing issue in <i>[Flast]</i>\").</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs thus do not have state taxpayer standing on the ground that their Commerce Clause challenge is just like the Establishment Clause challenge in <i>Flast.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs also claim that their status as <i>municipal</i> taxpayers gives them standing to challenge the <i>state</i> franchise tax credit at issue here. The <i>Frothingham</i> Court noted with approval the standing of municipal residents to enjoin the \"illegal use of the moneys of a municipal corporation,\" relying on \"the peculiar relation of the corporate taxpayer to the corporation\" to distinguish such a case from the general bar on taxpayer suits. 262 U. S., at 486, 487; see <i>ASARCO,</i> 490 U. S., at 613-614 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (reiterating distinction). Plaintiffs here challenged the municipal property tax exemption as municipal taxpayers. That challenge was rejected by the Court of Appeals on the merits, and no issue regarding plaintiffs' standing to bring it has been raised. In plaintiffs' challenge to the state franchise tax credit, however, they identify no municipal action contributing to any claimed injury. Instead, they try to leverage the notion of municipal taxpayer standing beyond challenges to municipal action, in two ways.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>First, plaintiffs claim that because state law requires revenues from the franchise tax to be distributed to local governments, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 5733.12 (Lexis 2005), the award of a credit to DaimlerChrysler reduced such distributions and thus depleted the funds of \"local governments to which Respondents pay taxes.\" Brief for Respondents 16. But plaintiffs' challenge is still to the state law and state <span class=\"star-pagination\">*350</span> decision, not those of their municipality. We have already explained why a state taxpayer lacks standing to challenge a state fiscal decision on the grounds that it might affect his tax liability. All plaintiffs have done in recasting their claims as ones brought by municipal taxpayers whose municipalities receive funding from the State\u0097the level of which might be affected by the same state fiscal decision\u0097is introduce yet another level of conjecture to their already hypothetical claim of injury.</p>\n<p>And in fact events have highlighted the peril of assuming that any revenue increase resulting from a taxpayer suit will be put to a particular use. Ohio's General Assembly suspended the statutory budget mechanism that distributes franchise tax revenues to local governments in 2001 and again in its subsequent biennial budgets. See Amended Substitute H. B. 94, 124th General Assembly \u00a7 140 (2001), available at http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/BillText124/ 124_HB_94_ENR.pdf (all Internet materials as visited May 12, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court's case file); Amended Substitute H. B. 95, 125th General Assembly \u00a7 139 (2003), available at http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/ BillText125/125_HB_95_EN2_N.pdf; Amended Substitute H. B. 66, 126th General Assembly \u00a7 557.12 (2005), available at http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/BillText126/126_HB_66_EN2d.pdf. Any effect that enjoining DaimlerChrysler's credit will have on municipal funds, therefore, will not result from automatic operation of a statutory formula, but from a hypothesis that the state government will choose to direct the supposed revenue from the restored franchise tax to municipalities. This is precisely the sort of conjecture we may not entertain in assessing standing. See <i>ASARCO, supra,</i> at 614 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The second way plaintiffs seek to leverage their standing to challenge the municipal property tax exemption into a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*351</span> challenge to the franchise tax credit is by relying on <i>Mine Workers</i> v. <i>Gibbs,</i> 383 U. S. 715 (1966). According to plaintiffs, the \"supplemental jurisdiction\" recognized in that case supports jurisdiction over all their claims, once the District Court determined they had standing to challenge the property tax exemption. Brief for Respondents 17-18.</p>\n<p><i>Gibbs</i> held that federal-question jurisdiction over a claim may authorize a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over state-law claims that may be viewed as part of the same case because they \"derive from a common nucleus of operative fact\" as the federal claim. 383 U. S., at 725. Plaintiffs assume that <i>Gibbs</i> stands for the proposition that federal jurisdiction extends to all claims sufficiently related to a claim within Article III to be part of the same case, regardless of the nature of the deficiency that would keep the former claims out of federal court if presented on their own.</p>\n<p>Our general approach to the application of <i>Gibbs,</i> however, has been markedly more cautious. For example, as a matter of statutory construction of the pertinent jurisdictional provisions, we refused to extend <i>Gibbs</i> to allow claims to be asserted against nondiverse parties when jurisdiction was based on diversity, see <i>Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co.</i> v. <i>Kroger,</i> 437 U. S. 365 (1978), and we refused to extend <i>Gibbs</i> to authorize supplemental jurisdiction over claims that do not satisfy statutory amount-in-controversy requirements, see <i>Finley</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 490 U. S. 545 (1989). As the Court explained just last Term, \"[w]e have not . . . applied <i>Gibbs</i>' expansive interpretive approach to other aspects of the jurisdictional statutes.\" <i>Exxon Mobil Corp.</i> v. <i>Allapattah Services, Inc.,</i> 545 U. S. 546, 553 (2005) (applying 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1367, enacted in 1990, to allow a federal court in a diversity action to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over additional diverse plaintiffs whose claims failed to meet the amount-in-controversy threshold).</p>\n<p>What we have never done is apply the rationale of <i>Gibbs</i> to permit a federal court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction <span class=\"star-pagination\">*352</span> over a claim that does not itself satisfy those elements of the Article III inquiry, such as constitutional standing, that \"serv[e] to identify those disputes which are appropriately resolved through the judicial process.\" <i>Whitmore,</i> 495 U. S., at 155. We see no reason to read the language of <i>Gibbs</i> so broadly, particularly since our standing cases confirm that a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press. See <i>Allen,</i> 468 U. S., at 752 (\"[T]he standing inquiry requires careful judicial examination of a complaint's allegations to ascertain whether the particular plaintiff is entitled to an adjudication of the <i>particular claims</i> asserted\" (emphasis added)). We have insisted, for instance, that \"a plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each form of relief sought.\" <i>Laidlaw,</i> 528 U. S., at 185; see <i>Los Angeles</i> v. <i>Lyons,</i> 461 U. S. 95, 109 (1983). But if standing were commutative, as plaintiffs claim, this insistence would make little sense when all claims for relief derive from a \"common nucleus of operative fact,\" as they certainly appear to have in both <i>Laidlaw, supra,</i> at 175-179, and <i>Lyons, supra,</i> at 97-98.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' reading of <i>Gibbs</i> to allow standing as to one claim to suffice for all claims arising from the same \"nucleus of operative fact\" would have remarkable implications. The doctrines of mootness, ripeness, and political question all originate in Article III's \"case\" or \"controversy\" language, no less than standing does. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>National Park Hospitality Assn.</i> v. <i>Department of Interior,</i> 538 U. S. 803, 808 (2003) (ripeness); <i>Arizonans for Official English</i> v. <i>Arizona,</i> 520 U. S. 43, 67 (1997) (mootness); <i>Reservists Comm. to Stop the War,</i> 418 U. S., at 215 (political question). Yet if <i>Gibbs</i>' \"common nucleus\" formulation announced a new definition of \"case\" or \"controversy\" for all Article III purposes, a federal court would be free to entertain moot or unripe claims, or claims presenting a political question, if they \"derived from\" the same \"operative fact[s]\" as another federal claim suffering <span class=\"star-pagination\">*353</span> from none of these defects. Plaintiffs' reading of <i>Gibbs,</i> therefore, would amount to a significant revision of our precedent interpreting Article III. With federal courts thus deciding issues they would not otherwise be authorized to decide, the \"`tripartite allocation of power'\" that Article III is designed to maintain, <i>Valley Forge,</i> 454 U. S., at 474, would quickly erode; our emphasis on the standing requirement's role in maintaining this separation would be rendered hollow rhetoric. As we have explained, \"[t]he actual-injury requirement would hardly serve the purpose . . . of preventing courts from undertaking tasks assigned to the political branches[,] if once a plaintiff demonstrated harm from one particular inadequacy in government administration, the court were authorized to remedy <i>all</i> inadequacies in that administration.\" <i>Lewis</i> v. <i>Casey,</i> 518 U. S. 343, 357 (1996).</p>\n<p><i>Lewis</i> emphasized that \"[t]he remedy must of course be limited to the inadequacy that produced the injury in fact that the plaintiff has established.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Plaintiffs' theory of ancillary standing would contravene this principle. Plaintiffs failed to establish Article III injury with respect to their <i>state</i> taxes, and even if they did do so with respect to their <i>municipal</i> taxes, that injury does not entitle them to seek a remedy as to the state taxes. As the Court summed up the point in <i>Lewis,</i> \"standing is not dispensed in gross.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 358, n. 6.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*354</span> * * *</h2>\n<p>All the theories plaintiffs have offered to support their standing to challenge the franchise tax credit are unavailing. Because plaintiffs have no standing to challenge that credit, the lower courts erred by considering their claims against it on the merits. The judgment of the Sixth Circuit is therefore vacated in part, and the cases are remanded for dismissal of plaintiffs' challenge to the franchise tax credit.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE GINSBURG, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>Today's decision, the Court rightly points out, is solidly grounded in longstanding precedent, <i>Frothingham</i> v. <i>Mellon,</i> decided with <i>Massachusetts</i> v. <i>Mellon</i>, 262 U. S. 447 (1923), and <i>Doremus</i> v. <i>Board of Ed. of Hawthorne,</i> 342 U. S. 429 (1952), decisions that antedate current jurisprudence on standing to sue. See <i>ante,</i> at 343, 345. <i>Frothingham</i> held nonjusticiable a federal taxpayer's suit challenging a federal-spending program. See 262 U. S., at 487 (describing taxpayer's interest as \"minute and indeterminable\"). <i>Doremus</i> applied <i>Frothingham</i>'s reasoning to a state taxpayer's suit. 342 U. S., at 434. These decisions exclude from federal-court cognizance claims, not delineated by Congress, presenting generalized grievances. An exception to <i>Frothingham</i>'s rule, recognized post-<i>Doremus</i> in <i>Flast</i> v. <i>Cohen,</i> 392 U. S. 83 (1968), covers certain alleged violations of the Establishment Clause. The <i>Flast</i> exception has not been extended to other areas. See <i>Bowen</i> v. <i>Kendrick,</i> 487 U. S. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*355</span> 589, 618 (1988); cf. Enrich, Saving the States from Themselves: Commerce Clause Constraints on State Tax Incentives for Business, 110 Harv. L. Rev. 377, 417-418 (1996).</p>\n<p>One can accept, as I do, the nonjusticiability of <i>Frothingham</i>-type federal and state taxpayer suits in federal court without endorsing as well the limitations on standing later declared in <i>Simon</i> v. <i>Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization,</i> 426 U. S. 26 (1976) <i>(EKWRO); </i><i>Valley Forge Christian College</i> v. <i>Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,</i> 454 U.

See \u00a7\u00a7 5733.01(G), 5733.33(B)(1) (Lexis 2005). Where relevant, therefore, the citations in this opinion are to the statutes in effect at the time DaimlerChrysler made its investment.</p>\n<p>[2]  Other plaintiffs were residents of Toledo who claimed they were injured because they were displaced by the DaimlerChrysler expansion and Michigan residents who claimed injury because DaimlerChrysler would have expanded its operations in Michigan but for the Ohio investment tax credit. Plaintiffs neither identified these allegations as a basis for standing in their merits brief before this Court nor referred to them at oral argument. Any argument based on these allegations is therefore abandoned. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>International Business Machines Corp.,</i> 517 U. S. 843, 855, and n. 3 (1996).</p>\n<p>[3]  Because defendants removed the case from state court to District Court, plaintiffs were not initially the parties that invoked federal jurisdiction. Indeed, plaintiffs initially expressed doubts as to their standing. Nonetheless, because \"[w]e presume that federal courts lack jurisdiction unless the contrary appears affirmatively from the record,\" <i>Renne</i> v. <i>Geary,</i> 501 U. S. 312, 316 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted), the party asserting federal jurisdiction when it is challenged has the burden of establishing it. Whatever the parties' previous positions on the propriety of a federal forum, plaintiffs, as the parties seeking to establish federal jurisdiction, must make the showings required for standing.</p>\n<p>[4]  The majority of the Courts of Appeals to have considered the issue have reached a similar conclusion. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Booth</i> v. <i>Hvass,</i> 302 F. 3d 849 (CA8 2002); <i>Board of Ed. of Mt. Sinai Union Free School Dist.</i> v. <i>New York State Teachers Retirement System,</i> 60 F. 3d 106 (CA2 1995); <i>Colorado Taxpayers Union, Inc.</i> v. <i>Romer,</i> 963 F. 2d 1394 (CA10 1992); <i>Taub</i> v. <i>Kentucky,</i> 842 F. 2d 912 (CA6 1988); <i>Korioth</i> v. <i>Briscoe,</i> 523 F. 2d 1271 (CA5 1975); but cf. <i>Arakaki</i> v. <i>Lingle,</i> 423 F. 3d 954, 967-969 (CA9 2005) (finding state taxpayer standing in light of <i>Hoohuli</i> v. <i>Ariyoshi,</i> 741 F. 2d 1169 (CA9 1984), but noting that Justice Kennedy's opinion in <i>ASARCO Inc.</i> v. <i>Kadish,</i> 490 U. S. 605 (1989), would \"carry persuasive value\" absent <i>Hoohuli</i>).</p>\n<p>[5]  In defending the contrary position, plaintiffs rely on three cases from the Courts of Appeals. But two of those cases hold only that, once a litigant has standing to request invalidation of a particular agency action, it may do so by identifying all grounds on which the agency may have \"`failed to comply with its statutory mandate.'\" <i>Sierra Club</i> v. <i>Adams,</i> 578 F. 2d 389, 392 (CADC 1978) (quoting <i>Sierra Club</i> v. <i>Morton,</i> 405 U. S. 727, 737 (1972)); see also <i>Iowa Independent Bankers</i> v. <i>Board of Governors of Fed. Reserve,</i> 511 F. 2d 1288, 1293-1294 (CADC 1975). They do not establish that the litigant can, by virtue of his standing to challenge one government action, challenge other governmental actions that did not injure him. In the third case, the Court of Appeals relied substantially on the fact that \"all courts possess an inherent power to prevent unprofessional conduct by those attorneys who are practicing before them\" in allowing the Government to contest the division of a damages award it was ordered to pay between a plaintiff and his attorney. <i>Jackson</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 881 F. 2d 707, 710, 711 (CA9 1989). That situation is rather far afield from the question before us.</p>\n\n</div>",

Argued March 1, 2006\u2014Decided May 15, 2006*\nThe city of Toledo and State of Ohio sought to encourage DaimlerChrys\n  ler Corp. to expand its Toledo operations by offering it local property\n  tax exemptions and a state franchise tax credit. A group of plaintiffs\n  including Toledo residents who pay state and local taxes sued in state\n  court, alleging that the tax breaks violated the Commerce Clause.\n  The taxpayer plaintiffs claimed injury because the tax breaks de\n  pleted the state and local treasuries to which they contributed. De\n  fendants removed the action to District Court. Plaintiffs moved to\n  remand to state court because, inter alia, they doubted whether they\n  satisfied either the constitutional or prudential limitations on stand\n  ing in federal court. The District Court declined to remand the case,\n  concluding that plaintiffs had standing under the \u201cmunicipal tax\n  payer standing\u201d rule articulated in Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S.\n  447. On the merits, the court found that neither tax benefit violated\n  the Commerce Clause. Without addressing standing, the Sixth Cir\n  cuit agreed as to the municipal tax exemption, but held that the state\n  franchise tax credit violated the Commerce Clause. Defendants\n  sought certiorari to review the invalidation of the franchise tax\n  credit, and plaintiffs sought certiorari to review the upholding of the\n  property tax exemption. This Court granted review to consider\n  whether the franchise tax credit violates the Commerce Clause, and\n  directed the parties to address the issue of standing.\nHeld: Plaintiffs have not established their standing to challenge the\n state franchise tax credit.

Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751. Plaintiffs, as the parties now as\n    serting federal jurisdiction, must carry the burden of establishing\n    their standing. Pp. 4\u20136.\n          (b) Plaintiffs\u2019 principal claim that the franchise tax credit de\n    pletes state funds to which they contribute through their taxes, and\n    thus diminishes the total funds available for lawful uses and imposes\n    disproportionate burdens on them, is insufficient to establish stand\n    ing under Article III. This Court has denied federal taxpayers stand\n    ing under Article III to object to a particular expenditure of federal\n    funds simply because they are taxpayers. See, e.g., Valley Forge\n    Christian College, supra, at 476\u2013482. The animating principle behind\n    cases such as Valley Forge was announced in Frothingham v. Mellon,\n    decided with Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, in which the\n    Court observed that a federal taxpayer\u2019s \u201cinterest in the moneys of\n    the Treasury . . . is shared with millions of others; is comparatively\n    minute and indeterminable; and the effect upon future taxation, of\n    any payment out of the funds, so remote, fluctuating and uncertain,\n    that no basis is afforded for an appeal to the preventive powers of a\n    court of equity.\u201d Id., at 486\u2013487. This rationale applies with undi\n    minished force to state taxpayers who allege simply that a state fiscal\n    decision will deplete the fisc and \u201cimpose disproportionate burdens on\n    them.\u201d See Doremus v. Board of Ed. of Hawthorne, 342 U. S. 429, 433\u2013\n    434. Because state budgets frequently have an array of tax and\n    spending provisions that may be challenged on a variety of bases, af\n    fording state taxpayers standing to press such challenges simply be\n    cause their tax burden gives them an interest in the state treasury\n    would interpose the federal courts as \u201c \u2018virtually continuing monitors\n    of the wisdom and soundness\u2019 \u201d of state fiscal administration, con\n                   Cite as: 547 U.

Pp. 7\u201311.\n      (c) Also rejected is plaintiffs\u2019 argument that they have state tax\npayer standing on the ground that their Commerce Clause challenge\nis just like the Establishment Clause challenge this Court permitted\nin Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, 105\u2013106. Flast allowed an Estab\nlishment Clause challenge by federal taxpayers to a congressional ac\ntion under Art. I, \u00a78. Although Flast held out the possibility that\n\u201cspecific [constitutional] limitations\u201d other than the Establishment\nClause might support federal taxpayer standing, id., at 105, 85, only\nthe Establishment Clause has been held to do so since Flast, see, e.g.,\nBowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 618. Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on Flast is\nmisguided: Whatever rights plaintiffs have under the Commerce\nClause, they are fundamentally unlike the right not to contribute\neven \u201cthree pence\u201d to support a religious establishment that was up\nheld in Flast, 392 U. S., at 103. Indeed, plaintiffs compare the two\nClauses at such a high level of generality that almost any constitu\ntional constraint on government power could be likened to the Estab\nlishment Clause as interpreted in Flast. Id., at 105. And a finding\nthat the Commerce Clause satisfies the Flast test because it often\nimplicates governments\u2019 fiscal decisions would leave no principled\nway of distinguishing other constitutional provisions that also con\nstrain governments\u2019 taxing and spending decisions. See, e.g., Arkan\nsas Writers\u2019 Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U. S. 221. Yet such a broad\napplication of Flast\u2019s exception to the general prohibition on taxpayer\nstanding would be at odds with Flast\u2019s own promise that it would not\ntransform federal courts into forums for taxpayers\u2019 \u201cgeneralized\ngrievances.\u201d 392 U. S., at 106. Pp. 11\u201313.\n   2. Plaintiffs\u2019 status as municipal taxpayers does not give them\nstanding to challenge the state franchise tax credit at issue.\n   This Court has noted with approval the standing of municipal tax\npayers to enjoin the illegal use of a municipal corporation\u2019s funds.\nSee, e.g., Frothingham, supra, at 486\u2013487. But plaintiffs\u2019 attempts to\nleverage the notion of municipal taxpayer standing into standing to\nchallenge the state tax credit are unavailing. Pp. 13\u201318.\n      (a) Plaintiffs argue that because state law requires revenues\nfrom the franchise tax to be distributed to local governments, the\naward of a credit to DaimlerChrysler reduced such distributions and\nthus depleted the funds of local governments to which plaintiffs pay\ntaxes. But plaintiffs\u2019 challenge is still to the state law and state deci\nsion, not those of plaintiffs\u2019 municipality. Their argument thus suf\nfers from the same defects that the claim of state taxpayer standing\nexhibits.

Gibbs, 383 U. S. 715.\n    Gibbs held that federal-question jurisdiction over a claim may au\n    thorize a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over state-law claims\n    that may be viewed as part of the same case because they \u201cderive\n    from a common nucleus of operative fact\u201d as the federal claim. Id., at\n    725. Plaintiffs assume that Gibbs stands for the proposition that fed\n    eral jurisdiction extends to all claims sufficiently related to a claim\n    within Article III to be part of the same case, regardless of the defi\n    ciency that would keep the former claims out of federal court if pre\n    sented on their own. This Court\u2019s general approach to the applica\n    tion of Gibbs has been markedly more cautious. See, e.g., Exxon\n    Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545 U. S. ___, ___. The Court\n    has never applied Gibbs\u2019 rationale to permit a federal court to exercise\n    supplemental jurisdiction over a claim that does not itself satisfy\n    those elements of the Article III inquiry, such as constitutional stand\n    ing, that \u201cserv[e] to identify those disputes which are appropriately\n    resolved through the judicial process.\u201d Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495\n    U. S. 149, 155. There is no reason to read Gibbs\u2019 language as broadly as\n    plaintiffs urge, particularly since the Court\u2019s standing cases confirm\n    that a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to\n    press, see, e.g., Allen, supra, at 752. If standing were commutative,\n    as plaintiffs claim, the Court\u2019s insistence that a plaintiff must dem\n    onstrate standing separately for each form of relief sought, see, e.g.,\n    Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.,\n    528 U. S. 167, 185, would make little sense when all claims for relief\n    derive from a \u201ccommon nucleus of operative fact,\u201d as they appear to\n    have in cases like Laidlaw.\n       Such a reading of Gibbs would have remarkable implications. The\n    doctrines of mootness, ripeness, and political question all originate in\n    Article III\u2019s \u201ccase\u201d or \u201ccontroversy\u201d language, no less than standing\n    does. See, e.g., National Park Hospitality Assn. v. Department of In\n    terior, 538 U. S. 803, 808. Yet if Gibbs\u2019 \u201ccommon nucleus\u201d formula\n    tion announced a new definition of \u201ccase\u201d or \u201ccontroversy\u201d for all Arti\n    cle III purposes, a federal court would be free to entertain moot or\n    unripe claims, or claims presenting a political question, if they \u201cde\n    rived from\u201d the same \u201coperative fact[s]\u201d as another federal claim suf\n    fering from none of these defects. Plaintiffs\u2019 reading of Gibbs, there\n    fore, would amount to a significant revision of the Court\u2019s precedent\n    interpreting Article III. With federal courts thus deciding issues they\n    would not otherwise be authorized to decide, the \u201c \u2018tripartite alloca\n    tion of power\u2019 \u201d that Article III is designed to maintain, Valley Forge,\n    supra, at 474, would quickly erode, and the Court\u2019s emphasis on the\n                    Cite as: 547 U.

S.\nArmy by the Willys-Overland Motor Company in Toledo,\nOhio. Nearly 60 years later, the city of Toledo and State of\nOhio sought to encourage the current manufacturer of\nJeeps\u2014DaimlerChrysler\u2014to expand its Jeep operation in\nToledo, by offering local and state tax benefits for new\ninvestment. Taxpayers in Toledo sued, alleging that their\nlocal and state tax burdens were increased by the tax\nbreaks for DaimlerChrysler, tax breaks that they asserted\nviolated the Commerce Clause. The Court of Appeals\nagreed that a state tax credit offered under Ohio law\nviolated the Commerce Clause, and state and local officials\n2               DAIMLERCHRYSLER CORP. v. CUNO\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nand DaimlerChrysler sought review in this Court. We are\nobligated before reaching this Commerce Clause question\nto determine whether the taxpayers who objected to the\ncredit have standing to press their complaint in federal\ncourt. We conclude that they do not, and we therefore can\nproceed no further.\n                                I\n  Ohio levies a franchise tax \u201cupon corporations for the\nprivilege of doing business in the state, owning or using a\npart or all of its capital or property in [the] state, or hold\ning a certificate of compliance authorizing it to do business\nin [the] state.\u201d Wesnovtek Corp. v.

A tax\npayer that purchases \u201cnew manufacturing machinery and\nequipment\u201d and installs it at sites in the State receives a\ncredit against the franchise tax. See \u00a75733.33(B)(1) (Lexis\n1999).1 Municipalities in Ohio may also offer partial\nproperty tax waivers to businesses that agree to invest\nin qualifying areas. See \u00a75709.62(C)(1)(a) (Lexis 2005).\nWith consent from local school districts, the partial prop\nerty tax waiver can be increased to a complete exemption.\nSee \u00a75709.62(D)(1).\n  In 1998, DaimlerChrysler entered into a contract with\nthe city of Toledo. Under the contract, DaimlerChrysler\nagreed to expand its Jeep assembly plant at Stickney\nAvenue in Toledo. In exchange, the city agreed to waive\nthe property tax for the plant, with the consent of the two\nschool districts in which the plant is located.

See\n\u00a75733.33(B)(1) (Lexis 1999).\n  Plaintiffs filed suit against various state and local offi\ncials and DaimlerChrysler in state court, alleging that\nthese tax benefits violated the Commerce Clause. Most of\nthe plaintiffs were residents of Toledo, who paid taxes to\nboth the city of Toledo and State of Ohio. They claimed\nthat they were injured because the tax breaks for Daim\nlerChrysler diminished the funds available to the city and\nState, imposing a \u201cdisproportionate burden\u201d on plaintiffs.\nApp. 18a, 23a, 28a.2\n  Defendants removed the action to the United States\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Ohio. See 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71441. Plaintiffs filed motions to remand the case\nto state court. See \u00a71447(c). One of the grounds on which\nthey sought remand concerned their standing. They pro\nfessed \u201csubstantial doubts about their ability to satisfy\neither the constitutional or the prudential limitations on\nstanding in the federal court,\u201d and urged the District\nCourt to avoid the issue entirely by remanding. Plaintiffs\u2019\nSupplemental Motion for Remand to State Court in No.\n3:00cv7247, p. 13, Record Doc. 17 (footnote omitted).\n  The District Court declined to remand the case, conclud\ning that, \u201c[a]t the bare minimum, the Plaintiffs who are\ntaxpayers have standing to object to the property tax\nexemption and franchise tax credit statutes under the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Other plaintiffs were residents of Toledo who claimed they were\n\ninjured because they were displaced by the DaimlerChrysler expansion\nand Michigan residents who claimed injury because DaimlerChrysler\nwould have expanded its operations in Michigan but for the Ohio\ninvestment tax credit. Plaintiffs neither identified these allegations as\na basis for standing in their merits brief before this Court nor referred\nto them at oral argument. Any argument based on these allegations is\ntherefore abandoned. See, e.g., United States v. International Business\nMachines Corp., 517 U. S. 843, 855, and n. 3 (1996).\n4            DAIMLERCHRYSLER CORP. v. CUNO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u2018municipal taxpayer standing\u2019 rule articulated in Massa\nchusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447 (1923).\u201d App. 78a (citations\nomitted). On the merits, the District Court found that\nneither tax benefit violated the Commerce Clause. See\n154 F. Supp. 2d 1196 (2001). The Court of Appeals for the\nSixth Circuit agreed with the District Court as to the\nmunicipal property tax exemption, but held that the state\nfranchise tax credit violated the Commerce Clause. See\n386 F. 3d 738 (2004). The Court of Appeals did not ad\ndress the issue of standing.\n  Defendants sought certiorari to review the Sixth Cir\ncuit\u2019s invalidation of the franchise tax credit and plaintiffs\nsought certiorari to review the upholding of the property\ntax exemption. We granted certiorari to consider whether\nthe franchise tax credit violates the Commerce Clause, 545\nU. S. ___ (2005); the Michigan Supreme Court had decided\na similar question contrary to the Sixth Circuit\u2019s analysis\nhere. See Caterpillar, Inc. v. Dept. of Treasury, 440 Mich.\n400, 488 N. W. 2d 182 (1992). We also asked the parties to\naddress whether plaintiffs have standing to challenge the\nfranchise tax credit in this litigation.\n                            II\n  We have \u201can obligation to assure ourselves\u201d of litigants\u2019\nstanding under Article III. Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laid-\nlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 180\n(2000). We therefore begin by addressing plaintiffs\u2019 claims\nthat they have standing as taxpayers to challenge the fran\nchise tax credit.\n                             A\n   Chief Justice Marshall, in Marbury v. Madison, 1\nCranch 137 (1803), grounded the Federal Judiciary\u2019s\nauthority to exercise judicial review and interpret the\nConstitution on the necessity to do so in the course of\ncarrying out the judicial function of deciding cases. As\nMarshall explained, \u201c[t]hose who apply the rule to particu\n                 Cite as: 547 U.

Determining that a matter before the\nfederal courts is a proper case or controversy under Article\nIII therefore assumes particular importance in ensuring\nthat the Federal Judiciary respects \u201c \u2018the proper\u2014and\nproperly limited\u2014role of the courts in a democratic soci\nety,\u2019 \u201d Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 750 (1984) (quoting\nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 498 (1975)). If a dispute is\nnot a proper case or controversy, the courts have no busi\nness deciding it, or expounding the law in the course of\ndoing so.\n   This Court has recognized that the case-or-controversy\nlimitation is crucial in maintaining the \u201c \u2018tripartite alloca\ntion of power\u2019 \u201d set forth in the Constitution. Valley Forge\nChristian College v. Americans United for Separation of\nChurch and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 474 (1982) (quoting\nFlast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, 95 (1968)). Marshall again\nmade the point early on, this time in a speech in the House\nof Representatives. \u201cA case in law or equity,\u201d Marshall\nremarked,\n    \u201cwas a term . . . of limited signification. It was a con\n    troversy between parties which had taken a shape for\n    judicial decision. If the judicial power extended to\n    every question under the constitution it would involve\n    almost every subject proper for legislative discussion\n    and decision; if to every question under the laws and\n    treaties of the United States it would involve almost\n    every subject on which the executive could act. The\n    division of power [among the branches of government]\n    could exist no longer, and the other departments\n    would be swallowed up by the judiciary.\u201d 4 Papers of\n    John Marshall 95 (C. Cullen ed. 1984).\nAs this Court has explained, \u201c \u2018[n]o principle is more fun\ndamental to the judiciary\u2019s proper role in our system of\ngovernment than the constitutional limitation of federal\n6               DAIMLERCHRYSLER CORP. v. CUNO\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies.\u2019 \u201d Raines\nv. Byrd, 521 U. S. 811, 818 (1997) (quoting Simon v. Eastern\nKy. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U. S. 26, 37 (1976)).\n   The case-or-controversy requirement thus plays a criti\ncal role, and \u201cArticle III standing . . . enforces the Consti\ntution\u2019s case-or-controversy requirement.\u201d         Elk Grove\nUnified School Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U. S. 1, 11 (2004). The\n\u201ccore component\u201d of the requirement that a litigant have\nstanding to invoke the authority of a federal court \u201cis an\nessential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy\nrequirement of Article III.\u201d Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992). The requisite elements of this\n\u201ccore component derived directly from the Constitution\u201d\nare familiar: \u201cA plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly\ntraceable to the defendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct\nand likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\u201d Allen,\nsupra, at 751. We have been asked to decide an important\nquestion of constitutional law concerning the Commerce\nClause. But before we do so, we must find that the\nquestion is presented in a \u201ccase\u201d or \u201ccontroversy\u201d that\nis, in James Madison\u2019s words, \u201cof a Judiciary Nature.\u201d 2\nRecords of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 430\n(M. Farrand ed. 1966). That requires plaintiffs, as the\nparties now asserting federal jurisdiction, to carry the\nburden of establishing their standing under Article III.3\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 Becausedefendants removed the case from state court to District\nCourt, plaintiffs were not initially the parties that invoked federal\njurisdiction. Indeed, plaintiffs initially expressed doubts as to their\nstanding. Nonetheless, because \u201c[w]e presume that federal courts lack\njurisdiction unless the contrary appears affirmatively from the record,\u201d\nRenne v. Geary, 501 U. S. 312, 316 (1991) (internal quotation marks\nomitted), the party asserting federal jurisdiction when it is challenged\nhas the burden of establishing it. Whatever the parties\u2019 previous\npositions on the propriety of a federal forum, plaintiffs, as the parties\nseeking to establish federal jurisdiction, must make the showings\nrequired for standing.\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              B\n   Plaintiffs principally claim standing by virtue of their\nstatus as Ohio taxpayers, alleging that the franchise tax\ncredit \u201cdepletes the funds of the State of Ohio to which the\nPlaintiffs contribute through their tax payments\u201d and thus\n\u201cdiminish[es] the total funds available for lawful uses and\nimpos[es] disproportionate burdens on\u201d them. App. 28a;\nsee also Brief for Respondents 24. On several occasions,\nthis Court has denied federal taxpayers standing under\nArticle III to object to a particular expenditure of federal\nfunds simply because they are taxpayers. Thus the al\nleged \u201cdeprivation of the fair and constitutional use of [a\nfederal taxpayer\u2019s] tax dollar\u201d cannot support a challenge\nto the conveyance of Government land to a private reli\ngious college, Valley Forge, supra, at 476\u2013482 (internal\nquotation marks and some brackets omitted), and \u201cthe\ninterest of a taxpayer in the moneys of the federal treasury\nfurnishes no basis\u201d to argue that a federal agency\u2019s loan\npractices are unconstitutional, Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes,\n302 U. S. 464, 478 (1938); see also Schlesinger v. Reservists\nComm. to Stop the War, 418 U. S. 208 (1974); United States\nv. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166 (1974).\n   The animating principle behind these cases was an\nnounced in their progenitor, Frothingham v. Mellon, de\ncided with Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447 (1923).\nIn rejecting a claim that improper federal appropriations\nwould \u201cincrease the burden of future taxation and thereby\ntake [the plaintiff\u2019s] property without due process of law,\u201d\nthe Court observed that a federal taxpayer\u2019s\n    \u201cinterest in the moneys of the Treasury . . . is shared\n    with millions of others; is comparatively minute and\n    indeterminable; and the effect upon future taxation, of\n    any payment out of the funds, so remote, fluctuating\n    and uncertain, that no basis is afforded for an appeal\n    to the preventive powers of a court of equity.\u201d Id., at\n    486\u2013487.\n8             DAIMLERCHRYSLER CORP. v. CUNO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThis logic is equally applicable to taxpayer challenges to\nexpenditures that deplete the treasury, and to taxpayer\nchallenges to so-called \u201ctax expenditures,\u201d which reduce\namounts available to the treasury by granting tax credits\nor exemptions. In either case, the alleged injury is based\non the asserted effect of the allegedly illegal activity on\npublic revenues, to which the taxpayer contributes.\n   Standing has been rejected in such cases because the\nalleged injury is not \u201cconcrete and particularized,\u201d Defend\ners of Wildlife, supra, at 560, but instead a grievance the\ntaxpayer \u201csuffers in some indefinite way in common with\npeople generally,\u201d Frothingham, supra, at 488. In addi\ntion, the injury is not \u201cactual or imminent,\u201d but instead\n\u201cconjectural or hypothetical.\u201d Defenders of Wildlife, supra,\nat 560 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). As\nan initial matter, it is unclear that tax breaks of the sort\nat issue here do in fact deplete the treasury: The very\npoint of the tax benefits is to spur economic activity, which\nin turn increases government revenues. In this very ac\ntion, the Michigan plaintiffs claimed that they were in\njured because they lost out on the added revenues that\nwould have accompanied DaimlerChrysler\u2019s decision to\nexpand facilities in Michigan. See n. 2, supra.\n   Plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injury is also \u201cconjectural or hypotheti\ncal\u201d in that it depends on how legislators respond to a reduc\ntion in revenue, if that is the consequence of the credit.\nEstablishing injury requires speculating that elected offi\ncials will increase a taxpayer-plaintiff\u2019s tax bill to make up a\ndeficit; establishing redressability requires speculating that\nabolishing the challenged credit will redound to the benefit\nof the taxpayer because legislators will pass along the sup\nposed increased revenue in the form of tax reductions.\nNeither sort of speculation suffices to support standing. See\nASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, 614 (1989) (opinion\nof KENNEDY, J.)

S., at 564\u2013565, n. 2.\n  The foregoing rationale for rejecting federal taxpayer\nstanding applies with undiminished force to state taxpay\ners. We indicated as much in Doremus v. Board of Ed. of\nHawthorne, 342 U. S. 429 (1952). In that case, we noted our\nearlier holdings that \u201cthe interests of a taxpayer in the\nmoneys of the federal treasury are too indeterminable,\nremote, uncertain and indirect\u201d to support standing to\nchallenge \u201ctheir manner of expenditure.\u201d Id., at 433. We\nthen \u201creiterate[d]\u201d what we had said in rejecting a federal\ntaxpayer challenge to a federal statute \u201cas equally true\nwhen a state Act is assailed: \u2018The [taxpayer] must be able to\nshow . . . that he has sustained . . . some direct injury . . .\nand not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in\ncommon with people generally.\u2019\u201d Id., at 433\u2013434 (quoting\nFrothingham, supra, at 488); see ASARCO, supra, at 613\u2013\n614 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (\u201c[W]e have likened state\ntaxpayers to federal taxpayers\u201d for purposes of taxpayer\nstanding (citing Doremus, supra, at 434)).\n  The allegations of injury that plaintiffs make in their\ncomplaint furnish no better basis for finding standing\n10           DAIMLERCHRYSLER CORP. v. CUNO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthan those made in the cases where federal taxpayer\nstanding was denied. Plaintiffs claim that DaimlerChrys\nler\u2019s tax credit depletes the Ohio fisc and \u201cimpos[es] dis\nproportionate burdens on [them].\u201d App. 28a. This is no\ndifferent from similar claims by federal taxpayers we have\nalready rejected under Article III as insufficient to estab\nlish standing. See, e.g., Frothingham, 262 U. S., at 486\n(allegation of injury that the effect of government spend\ning \u201cwill be to increase the burden of future taxation and\nthereby take [plaintiff\u2019s] property without due process of\nlaw\u201d).\n   State policymakers, no less than their federal counter\nparts, retain broad discretion to make \u201cpolicy decisions\u201d\nconcerning state spending \u201cin different ways . . . depend\ning on their perceptions of wise state fiscal policy and\nmyriad other circumstances.\u201d ASARCO, supra, at 615\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Federal courts may not assume\na particular exercise of this state fiscal discretion in estab\nlishing standing; a party seeking federal jurisdiction\ncannot rely on such \u201c[s]peculative inferences . . . to connect\n[his] injury to the challenged actions of [the defendant],\u201d\nSimon, 426 U. S., at 45; see also Allen, 468 U. S., at 759.\nIndeed, because state budgets frequently contain an array\nof tax and spending provisions, any number of which may\nbe challenged on a variety of bases, affording state tax\npayers standing to press such challenges simply because\ntheir tax burden gives them an interest in the state treas\nury would interpose the federal courts as \u201c \u2018virtually con\ntinuing monitors of the wisdom and soundness\u2019 \u201d of state\nfiscal administration, contrary to the more modest role\nArticle III envisions for federal courts. See id., at 760\u2013761\n(quoting Laird v. Tatum, 408 U. S. 1, 15 (1972)).\n   For the foregoing reasons, we hold that state taxpayers\nhave no standing under Article III to challenge state tax\nor spending decisions simply by virtue of their status as\n                    Cite as: 547 U.

Cohen,\n392 U. S. 83. Flast held that because \u201cthe Establishment\nClause . . . specifically limit[s] the taxing and spending\npower conferred by Art. I, \u00a78,\u201d \u201ca taxpayer will have stand\ning consistent with Article III to invoke federal judicial\npower when he alleges that congressional action under the\ntaxing and spending clause is in derogation of \u201d the Estab\nlishment Clause. Id., at 105\u2013106. Flast held out the\npossibility that \u201cother specific [constitutional] limitations\u201d\non Art. I, \u00a78, might surmount the \u201cbarrier to suits against\nActs of Congress brought by individuals who can assert\nonly the interest of federal taxpayers.\u201d 392 U. S., at 105,\n85. But as plaintiffs candidly concede, \u201conly the Estab\nlishment Clause\u201d has supported federal taxpayer suits\nsince Flast. Brief for Respondents 12; see Bowen v. Ken\ndrick, 487 U. S. 589, 618 (1988) (\u201cAlthough we have con\nsidered the problem of standing and Article III limitations\non federal jurisdiction many times since [Flast], we have\nconsistently adhered to Flast and the narrow exception it\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The majority of the Courts of Appeals to have considered the issue\nhave reached a similar conclusion.

CUNO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncreated to the general rule against taxpayer standing\u201d).\n   Quite apart from whether the franchise tax credit is\nanalogous to an exercise of congressional power under Art.\nI, \u00a78, plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on Flast is misguided: Whatever\nrights plaintiffs have under the Commerce Clause, they\nare fundamentally unlike the right not to \u201c \u2018contribute\nthree pence . . . for the support of any one [religious] estab\nlishment.\u2019 \u201d 392 U. S., at 103 (quoting 2 Writings of James\nMadison 186 (G. Hunt ed. 1901)). Indeed, plaintiffs com\npare the Establishment Clause to the Commerce Clause at\nsuch a high level of generality that almost any constitu\ntional constraint on government power would \u201cspecifically\nlimit\u201d a State\u2019s taxing and spending power for Flast pur\nposes. 392 U. S., at 105; see Brief for Respondents 14 (\u201cIn\neach case, the harm to be avoided by [the two clauses] is\nthe loss of governmental neutrality\u201d). And even if the two\nclauses are similar in that they often implicate govern\nments\u2019 fiscal decisions, see id., at 13\u201314, a finding that the\nCommerce Clause satisfies the Flast test would leave no\nprincipled way of distinguishing those other constitutional\nprovisions that we have recognized constrain govern\nments\u2019 taxing and spending decisions. See, e.g., Arkansas\nWriters\u2019 Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U. S. 221 (1987)\n(invalidating state sales tax under the Free Press Clause).\nYet such a broad application of Flast\u2019s exception to the\ngeneral prohibition on taxpayer standing would be quite at\nodds with its narrow application in our precedent and\nFlast\u2019s own promise that it would not transform federal\ncourts into forums for taxpayers\u2019 \u201cgeneralized grievances.\u201d\n392 U. S., at 106.\n   Flast is consistent with the principle, underlying the\nArticle III prohibition on taxpayer suits, that a litigant\nmay not assume a particular disposition of government\nfunds in establishing standing. The Flast Court discerned\nin the history of the Establishment Clause \u201cthe specific\nevils feared by [its drafters] that the taxing and spending\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npower would be used to favor one religion over another or\nto support religion in general.\u201d Id., at 103. The Court\ntherefore understood the \u201cinjury\u201d alleged in Establishment\nClause challenges to federal spending to be the very \u201cex\ntract[ion] and spen[ding]\u201d of \u201ctax money\u201d in aid of religion\nalleged by a plaintiff. Id., at 106. And an injunction\nagainst the spending would of course redress that injury,\nregardless of whether lawmakers would dispose of the\nsavings in a way that would benefit the taxpayer-plaintiffs\npersonally. See Valley Forge, 454 U. S., at 514 (STEVENS,\nJ., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he plaintiffs\u2019 invocation of the Estab\nlishment Clause was of decisive importance in resolving the\nstanding issue in [Flast] \u201d).\n   Plaintiffs thus do not have state taxpayer standing on\nthe ground that their Commerce Clause challenge is just\nlike the Establishment Clause challenge in Flast.\n                              III\n   Plaintiffs also claim that their status as municipal\ntaxpayers gives them standing to challenge the state\nfranchise tax credit at issue here. The Frothingham Court\nnoted with approval the standing of municipal residents to\nenjoin the \u201cillegal use of the moneys of a municipal corpo\nration,\u201d relying on \u201cthe peculiar relation of the corporate\ntaxpayer to the corporation\u201d to distinguish such a case\nfrom the general bar on taxpayer suits. 262 U. S., at 486\u2013\n487; see ASARCO, 490 U. S., at 613\u2013614 (opinion of\nKENNEDY, J.) (reiterating distinction). Plaintiffs here\nchallenged the municipal property tax exemption as mu\nnicipal taxpayers. That challenge was rejected by the\nCourt of Appeals on the merits, and no issue regarding\nplaintiffs\u2019 standing to bring it has been raised. In plain\ntiffs\u2019 challenge to the state franchise tax credit, however,\nthey identify no municipal action contributing to any\nclaimed injury. Instead, they try to leverage the notion of\nmunicipal taxpayer standing beyond challenges to munici\n14           DAIMLERCHRYSLER CORP. v. CUNO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npal action, in two ways.\n                                 A\n   First, plaintiffs claim that because state law requires\nrevenues from the franchise tax to be distributed to local\ngovernments, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a75733.12 (Lexis 2005),\nthe award of a credit to DaimlerChrysler reduced such\ndistributions and thus depleted the funds of \u201clocal gov\nernments to which Respondents pay taxes.\u201d Brief for\nRespondents 16. But plaintiffs\u2019 challenge is still to the\nstate law and state decision, not those of their municipal\nity. We have already explained why a state taxpayer lacks\nstanding to challenge a state fiscal decision on the grounds\nthat it might affect his tax liability. All plaintiffs have\ndone in recasting their claims as ones brought by munici\npal taxpayers whose municipalities receive funding from\nthe State\u2014the level of which might be affected by the\nsame state fiscal decision\u2014is introduce yet another level\nof conjecture to their already hypothetical claim of injury.\n   And in fact events have highlighted the peril of assum\ning that any revenue increase resulting from a taxpayer\nsuit will be put to a particular use. Ohio\u2019s General As\nsembly suspended the statutory budget mechanism that\ndistributes franchise tax revenues to local governments in\n2001 and again in its subsequent biennial budgets.\nSee Amended Substitute H.

S. ____ (2006)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmunicipal funds, therefore, will not result from automatic\noperation of a statutory formula, but from a hypothesis\nthat the state government will choose to direct the sup\nposed revenue from the restored franchise tax to munici\npalities. This is precisely the sort of conjecture we may\nnot entertain in assessing standing. See ASARCO, supra,\nat 614 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).\n                             B\n   The second way plaintiffs seek to leverage their stand\ning to challenge the municipal property tax exemption into\na challenge to the franchise tax credit is by relying on\nMine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U. S. 715 (1966). According to\nplaintiffs, the \u201csupplemental jurisdiction\u201d recognized in\nthat case supports jurisdiction over all their claims, once\nthe District Court determined they had standing to chal\nlenge the property tax exemption. Brief for Respondents\n17\u201318.\n   Gibbs held that federal-question jurisdiction over a\nclaim may authorize a federal court to exercise jurisdiction\nover state-law claims that may be viewed as part of the\nsame case because they \u201cderive from a common nucleus of\noperative fact\u201d as the federal claim. 383 U. S., at 725.\nPlaintiffs assume that Gibbs stands for the proposition\nthat federal jurisdiction extends to all claims sufficiently\nrelated to a claim within Article III to be part of the same\ncase, regardless of the nature of the deficiency that would\nkeep the former claims out of federal court if presented on\ntheir own.\n   Our general approach to the application of Gibbs, how\never, has been markedly more cautious. For example, as a\nmatter of statutory construction of the pertinent jurisidic\ntional provisions, we refused to extend Gibbs to allow\nclaims to be asserted against nondiverse parties when\njurisdiction was based on diversity, see Owen Equipment\n& Erection Co. v. Kroger, 437 U. S. 365 (1978), and we\n16            DAIMLERCHRYSLER CORP. v. CUNO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrefused to extend Gibbs to authorize supplemental juris\ndiction over claims that do not satisfy statutory amount-\nin-controversy requirements, see Finley v. United States,\n490 U. S. 545 (1989). As the Court explained just last\nTerm, \u201c[w]e have not . . . applied Gibbs\u2019 expansive inter\npretive approach to other aspects of the jurisdictional\nstatutes.\u201d Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc.,\n545 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 5) (applying 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71367, enacted in 1990, to allow a federal court in a diver\nsity action to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over addi\ntional diverse plaintiffs whose claims failed to meet the\namount-in-controversy threshold).\n   What we have never done is apply the rationale of Gibbs\nto permit a federal court to exercise supplemental jurisdic\ntion over a claim that does not itself satisfy those elements\nof the Article III inquiry, such as constitutional standing,\nthat \u201cserv[e] to identify those disputes which are appro\npriately resolved through the judicial process.\u201d Whitmore,\n495 U. S., at 155. We see no reason to read the language of\nGibbs so broadly, particularly since our standing cases\nconfirm that a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for\neach claim he seeks to press. See Allen, 468 U. S., at 752\n(\u201c[T]he standing inquiry requires careful judicial examina\ntion of a complaint\u2019s allegations to ascertain whether the\nparticular plaintiff is entitled to an adjudication of the\nparticular claims asserted\u201d (emphasis added)). We have\ninsisted, for instance, that \u201ca plaintiff must demonstrate\nstanding separately for each form of relief sought.\u201d Laid-\nlaw, 528 U. S., at 185; see Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S.\n95, 109 (1983). But if standing were commutative, as\nplaintiffs claim, this insistence would make little sense\nwhen all claims for relief derive from a \u201ccommon nucleus\nof operative fact,\u201d as they certainly appear to have in both\nLaidlaw, supra, at 175\u2013179, and Lyons, supra, at 97\u201398.\n   Plaintiffs\u2019 reading of Gibbs to allow standing as to one\nclaim to suffice for all claims arising from the same \u201cnu\n                  Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncleus of operative fact\u201d would have remarkable implica\ntions. The doctrines of mootness, ripeness, and political\nquestion all originate in Article III\u2019s \u201ccase\u201d or \u201ccontro\nversy\u201d language, no less than standing does. See, e.g.,\nNational Park Hospitality Assn. v. Department of Interior,\n538 U. S. 803, 808 (2003) (ripeness); Arizonans for Official\nEnglish v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 67 (1997) (mootness);\nReservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U. S., at 215 (po\nlitical question). Yet if Gibbs\u2019 \u201ccommon nucleus\u201d formula\ntion announced a new definition of \u201ccase\u201d or \u201ccontroversy\u201d\nfor all Article III purposes, a federal court would be free to\nentertain moot or unripe claims, or claims presenting a\npolitical question, if they \u201cderived from\u201d the same \u201copera\ntive fact[s]\u201d as another federal claim suffering from none\nof these defects. Plaintiffs\u2019 reading of Gibbs, therefore,\nwould amount to a significant revision of our precedent\ninterpreting Article III. With federal courts thus deciding\nissues they would not otherwise be authorized to decide,\nthe \u201c \u2018tripartite allocation of power\u2019 \u201d that Article III is\ndesigned to maintain, Valley Forge, 454 U. S., at 474, would\nquickly erode; our emphasis on the standing requirement\u2019s\nrole in maintaining this separation would be rendered\nhollow rhetoric. As we have explained, \u201c[t]he actual-injury\nrequirement would hardly serve the purpose . . . of pre\nventing courts from undertaking tasks assigned to the\npolitical branches[,] if once a plaintiff demonstrated harm\nfrom one particular inadequacy in government admini\nstration, the court were authorized to remedy all inade\nquacies in that administration.\u201d Lewis v. Casey, 518 U. S.\n343, 357 (1996).\n   Lewis emphasized that \u201c[t]he remedy must of course be\nlimited to the inadequacy that produced the injury in fact\nthat the plaintiff has established.\u201d Ibid. Plaintiffs\u2019 theory\nof ancillary standing would contravene this principle.\nPlaintiffs failed to establish Article III injury with respect\nto their state taxes, and even if they did do so with respect\n18               DAIMLERCHRYSLER CORP. v. CUNO\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nto their municipal taxes, that injury does not entitle them\nto seek a remedy as to the state taxes. As the Court\nsummed up the point in Lewis, \u201cstanding is not dispensed\nin gross.\u201d Id., at 358, n. 6.5\n                        *     *   *\n  All the theories plaintiffs have offered to support their\nstanding to challenge the franchise tax credit are unavail\ning. Because plaintiffs have no standing to challenge that\ncredit, the lower courts erred by considering their claims\nagainst it on the merits. The judgment of the Sixth Cir\ncuit is therefore vacated in part, and the cases are re\nmanded for dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the fran\nchise tax credit.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 In defending the contrary position, plaintiffs rely on three cases\n\nfrom the Courts of Appeals. But two of those cases hold only that, once\na litigant has standing to request invalidation of a particular agency\naction, it may do so by identifying all grounds on which the agency may\nhave \u201c \u2018failed to comply with its statutory mandate.\u2019 \u201d Sierra Club v.\nAdams, 578 F. 2d 389, 392 (CADC 1978) (quoting Sierra Club v. Morton,\n405 U. S. 727, 737 (1972)); see also Iowa Independent Bankers v. Board of\nGovernors of Fed. Reserve, 511 F. 2d 1288, 1293\u20131294 (CADC 1975). They\ndo not establish that the litigant can, by virtue of his standing to challenge\none government action, challenge other governmental actions that did not\ninjure him. In the third case, the Court of Appeals relied substantially on\nthe fact that \u201call courts possess an inherent power to prevent unprofes\nsional conduct by those attorneys who are practicing before them\u201d in\nallowing the Government to contest the division of a damages award it\nwas ordered to pay between a plaintiff and his attorney. Jackson v.\nUnited States, 881 F. 2d 707, 710\u2013711 (CA9 1989). That situation is\nrather far afield from the question before us.\n                 Cite as: 547 U.

S. Army by the Willys-Overland Motor Company in Toledo, Ohio. Nearly 60 years later, the city of Toledo and State of Ohio sought to encourage the current manufacturer of Jeeps\u0097 DaimlerChrysler\u0097to expand its Jeep operation in Toledo, by offering local and state tax benefits for new investment. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*338</span> Taxpayers in Toledo sued, alleging that their local and state tax burdens were increased by the tax breaks for Daimler-Chrysler, tax breaks that they asserted violated the Commerce Clause. The Court of Appeals agreed that a state tax credit offered under Ohio law violated the Commerce Clause, and state and local officials and DaimlerChrysler sought review in this Court. We are obligated before reaching this Commerce Clause question to determine whether the taxpayers who objected to the credit have standing to press their complaint in federal court. We conclude that they do not, and we therefore can proceed no further.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Ohio levies a franchise tax \"upon corporations for the privilege of doing business in the state, owning or using a part or all of its capital or property in [the] state, or holding a certificate of compliance authorizing it to do business in [the] state.\" <i>Wesnovtek Corp.</i> v. <i>Wilkins,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></span>, 313, 2005-Ohio-1826, \u00b6 2, 825 N. E. 2d 1099, 1100; see Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 5733.01 (Lexis 2005). A taxpayer that purchases \"new manufacturing machinery and equipment\" and installs it at sites in the State receives a credit against the franchise tax. See \u00a7 5733.33(B)(1) (Lexis 1999).<sup>[1]</sup> Municipalities in Ohio may also offer partial property tax waivers to businesses that agree to invest in qualifying areas. See \u00a7 5709.62(C)(1)(a) (Lexis 2005). With consent from local school districts, the partial property tax waiver can be increased to a complete exemption. See \u00a7 5709.62(D)(1).</p>\n<p>In 1998, DaimlerChrysler entered into a contract with the city of Toledo. Under the contract, DaimlerChrysler agreed to expand its Jeep assembly plant at Stickney Avenue in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*339</span> Toledo. In exchange, the city agreed to waive the property tax for the plant, with the consent of the two school districts in which the plant is located. Because DaimlerChrysler undertook to purchase and install \"new manufacturing machinery and equipment,\" it was also entitled to a credit against the state franchise tax. See \u00a7 5733.33(B)(1) (Lexis 1999).</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs filed suit against various state and local officials and DaimlerChrysler in state court, alleging that these tax benefits violated the Commerce Clause. Most of the plaintiffs were residents of Toledo, who paid taxes to both the city of Toledo and State of Ohio. They claimed that they were injured because the tax breaks for DaimlerChrysler diminished the funds available to the city and State, imposing a \"disproportionate burden\" on plaintiffs. App. 18a, 23a, 28a.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Defendants removed the action to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1441. Plaintiffs filed motions to remand the case to state court. See \u00a7 1447(c). One of the grounds on which they sought remand concerned their standing. They professed \"substantial doubts about their ability to satisfy either the constitutional or the prudential limitations on standing in the federal court,\" and urged the District Court to avoid the issue entirely by remanding. Plaintiffs' Supplemental Motion for Remand to State Court in No. 3:00cv7247, p. 13, Record, Doc. 17 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>The District Court declined to remand the case, concluding that, \"[a]t the bare minimum, the Plaintiffs who are taxpayers have standing to object to the property tax exemption <span class=\"star-pagination\">*340</span> and franchise tax credit statutes under the `municipal taxpayer standing' rule articulated in <i>Massachusetts</i> v. <i>Mellon,</i> 262 U. S. 447 (1923).\" App. 78a (citations omitted). On the merits, the District Court found that neither tax benefit violated the Commerce Clause. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2429424\"><a href=\"/opinion/2429424/cuno-v-daimlerchrysler-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1196</span></a></span> (2001). The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit agreed with the District Court as to the municipal property tax exemption, but held that the state franchise tax credit violated the Commerce Clause. See 386 F. 3d 738 (2004). The Court of Appeals did not address the issue of standing.</p>\n<p>Defendants sought certiorari to review the Sixth Circuit's invalidation of the franchise tax credit and plaintiffs sought certiorari to review the upholding of the property tax exemption. We granted certiorari to consider whether the franchise tax credit violates the Commerce Clause, 545 U. S. 1165 (2005); the Michigan Supreme Court had decided a similar question contrary to the Sixth Circuit's analysis here. See <i>Caterpillar, Inc.</i> v. <i>Department of Treasury,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1613623\"><a href=\"/opinion/1613623/caterpillar-inc-v-dept-of-treasury/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span>, 488 N. W. 2d 182 (1992). We also asked the parties to address whether plaintiffs have standing to challenge the franchise tax credit in this litigation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We have \"an obligation to assure ourselves\" of litigants' standing under Article III. <i>Friends of Earth, Inc.</i> v. <i>Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.,</i> 528 U. S. 167, 180 (2000). We therefore begin by addressing plaintiffs' claims that they have standing as taxpayers to challenge the franchise tax credit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Chief Justice Marshall, in <i>Marbury</i> v. <i>Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137 (1803), grounded the Federal Judiciary's authority to exercise judicial review and interpret the Constitution on the necessity to do so in the course of carrying out the judicial function of deciding cases. As Marshall explained, \"[t]hose who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound <span class=\"star-pagination\">*341</span> and interpret that rule.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 177. Determining that a matter before the federal courts is a proper case or controversy under Article III therefore assumes particular importance in ensuring that the Federal Judiciary respects \"`the proper\u0097and properly limited\u0097role of the courts in a democratic society,'\" <i>Allen</i> v. <i>Wright,</i> 468 U. S. 737, 750 (1984) (quoting <i>Warth</i> v. <i>Seldin,</i> 422 U. S. 490, 498 (1975)). If a dispute is not a proper case or controversy, the courts have no business deciding it, or expounding the law in the course of doing so.</p>\n<p>This Court has recognized that the case-or-controversy limitation is crucial in maintaining the \"`tripartite allocation of power'\" set forth in the Constitution. <i>Valley Forge Christian College</i> v. <i>Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,</i> 454 U. S. 464, 474 (1982) (quoting <i>Flast</i> v. <i>Cohen,</i> 392 U. S. 83, 95 (1968)). Marshall again made the point early on, this time in a speech in the House of Representatives. \"A case in law or equity,\" Marshall remarked,</p>\n<blockquote>\"was a term . . . of limited signification. It was a controversy between parties which had taken a shape for judicial decision. If the judicial power extended to every <i>question</i> under the constitution it would involve almost every subject proper for legislative discussion and decision; if to every <i>question</i> under the laws and treaties of the United States it would involve almost every subject on which the executive could act. The division of power [among the branches of government] could exist no longer, and the other departments would be swallowed up by the judiciary.\" 4 Papers of John Marshall 95 (C. Cullen ed. 1984).</blockquote>\n<p>As this Court has explained, \"`[n]o principle is more fundamental to the judiciary's proper role in our system of government than the constitutional limitation of federal-court jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies.'\" <i>Raines</i> v. <i>Byrd,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*342</span> 521 U. S. 811, 818 (1997) (quoting <i>Simon</i> v. <i>Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization,</i> 426 U. S. 26, 37 (1976)).</p>\n<p>The case-or-controversy requirement thus plays a critical role, and \"Article III standing . . . enforces the Constitution's case-or-controversy requirement.\" <i>Elk Grove Unified School Dist.</i> v. <i>Newdow,</i> 542 U. S. 1, 11 (2004). The \"core component\" of the requirement that a litigant have standing to invoke the authority of a federal court \"is an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III.\" <i>Lujan</i> v. <i>Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992). The requisite elements of this \"core component derived directly from the Constitution\" are familiar: \"A plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\" <i>Allen, supra,</i> at 751. We have been asked to decide an important question of constitutional law concerning the Commerce Clause. But before we do so, we must find that the question is presented in a \"case\" or \"controversy\" that is, in James Madison's words, \"of a Judiciary Nature.\" 2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 430 (M. Farrand ed. 1966). That requires plaintiffs, as the parties now asserting federal jurisdiction, to carry the burden of establishing their standing under Article III.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs principally claim standing by virtue of their status as Ohio taxpayers, alleging that the franchise tax credit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*343</span> \"depletes the funds of the State of Ohio to which the Plaintiffs contribute through their tax payments\" and thus \"diminish[es] the total funds available for lawful uses and impos[es] disproportionate burdens on\" them. App. 28a; see also Brief for Respondents 24. On several occasions, this Court has denied <i>federal</i> taxpayers standing under Article III to object to a particular expenditure of federal funds simply because they are taxpayers. Thus the alleged \"deprivation of the fair and constitutional use of [a federal taxpayer's] tax dollar\" cannot support a challenge to the conveyance of Government land to a private religious college, <i>Valley Forge, supra,</i> at 476, 482 (internal quotation marks and some brackets omitted), and \"the interest of a taxpayer in the moneys of the federal treasury furnishes no basis\" to argue that a federal agency's loan practices are unconstitutional, <i>Alabama Power Co.</i> v. <i>Ickes,</i> 302 U. S. 464, 478 (1938); see also <i>Schlesinger</i> v. <i>Reservists Comm. to Stop the War,</i> 418 U. S. 208 (1974); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Richardson,</i> 418 U. S. 166 (1974).</p>\n<p>The animating principle behind these cases was announced in their progenitor, <i>Frothingham</i> v. <i>Mellon,</i> decided with <i>Massachusetts</i> v. <i>Mellon,</i> 262 U. S. 447 (1923). In rejecting a claim that improper federal appropriations would \"increase the burden of future taxation and thereby take [the plaintiff's] property without due process of law,\" the Court observed that a federal taxpayer's</p>\n<blockquote>\"interest in the moneys of the Treasury . . . is shared with millions of others; is comparatively minute and indeterminable; and the effect upon future taxation, of any payment out of the funds, so remote, fluctuating and uncertain, that no basis is afforded for an appeal to the preventive powers of a court of equity.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 486, 487.</blockquote>\n<p>This logic is equally applicable to taxpayer challenges to expenditures that deplete the treasury, and to taxpayer challenges to so-called \"tax expenditures,\" which reduce amounts available to the treasury by granting tax credits or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*344</span> exemptions. In either case, the alleged injury is based on the asserted effect of the allegedly illegal activity on public revenues, to which the taxpayer contributes.</p>\n<p>Standing has been rejected in such cases because the alleged injury is not \"concrete and particularized,\" <i>Defenders of Wildlife, supra,</i> at 560, but instead a grievance the taxpayer \"suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally,\" <i>Frothingham, supra,</i> at 488. In addition, the injury is not \"actual or imminent,\" but instead \"conjectural or hypothetical.\" <i>Defenders of Wildlife, supra,</i> at 560 (internal quotation marks omitted). As an initial matter, it is unclear that tax breaks of the sort at issue here do in fact deplete the treasury: The very point of the tax benefits is to spur economic activity, which in turn <i>increases</i> government revenues. In this very action, the Michigan plaintiffs claimed that they were injured because they lost out on the added revenues that would have accompanied Daimler-Chrysler's decision to expand facilities in Michigan. See n. 2, <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' alleged injury is also \"conjectural or hypothetical\" in that it depends on how legislators respond to a reduction in revenue, if that is the consequence of the credit. Establishing injury requires speculating that elected officials will increase a taxpayer-plaintiff's tax bill to make up a deficit; establishing redressability requires speculating that abolishing the challenged credit will redound to the benefit of the taxpayer because legislators will pass along the supposed increased revenue in the form of tax reductions. Neither sort of speculation suffices to support standing. See <i>ASARCO Inc.</i> v. <i>Kadish,</i> 490 U. S. 605, 614 (1989) (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (\"[I]t is pure speculation whether the lawsuit would result in any actual tax relief for respondents\"); <i>Warth,</i> 422 U. S., at 509 (criticizing a taxpayer standing claim for the \"conjectural nature of the asserted injury\").</p>\n<p>A taxpayer plaintiff has no right to insist that the government dispose of any increased revenue it might experience <span class=\"star-pagination\">*345</span> as a result of his suit by decreasing his tax liability or bolstering programs that benefit him. To the contrary, the decision of how to allocate any such savings is the very epitome of a policy judgment committed to the \"broad and legitimate discretion\" of lawmakers, which \"the courts cannot presume either to control or to predict.\" <i>ASARCO, supra,</i> at 615 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). Under such circumstances, we have no assurance that the asserted injury is \"imminent\"\u0097 that it is \"certainly impending.\" <i>Whitmore</i> v. <i>Arkansas,</i> 495 U. S. 149, 158 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted); see <i>Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U. S., at 564-565, n. 2.</p>\n<p>The foregoing rationale for rejecting federal taxpayer standing applies with undiminished force to state taxpayers. We indicated as much in <i>Doremus</i> v. <i>Board of Ed. of Hawthorne,</i> 342 U. S. 429 (1952). In that case, we noted our earlier holdings that \"the interests of a taxpayer in the moneys of the federal treasury are too indeterminable, remote, uncertain and indirect\" to support standing to challenge \"their manner of expenditure.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 433. We then \"reiterate[d]\" what we had said in rejecting a federal taxpayer challenge to a federal statute \"as equally true when a state Act is assailed: `The [taxpayer] must be able to show . . . that he has sustained . . . some direct injury . . . and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 433-434 (quoting <i>Frothingham, supra,</i> at 488); see <i>ASARCO, supra,</i> at 613-614 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (\"[W]e have likened state taxpayers to federal taxpayers\" for purposes of taxpayer standing (citing <i>Doremus, supra,</i> at 434)).</p>\n<p>The allegations of injury that plaintiffs make in their complaint furnish no better basis for finding standing than those made in the cases where federal taxpayer standing was denied. Plaintiffs claim that DaimlerChrysler's tax credit depletes the Ohio fisc and \"impos[es] disproportionate burdens on [them].\" App. 28a. This is no different from similar claims by federal taxpayers we have already rejected under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*346</span> Article III as insufficient to establish standing. See, <i>e. g., Frothingham,</i> 262 U. S., at 486 (allegation of injury that the effect of government spending \"will be to increase the burden of future taxation and thereby take [plaintiff's] property without due process of law\").</p>\n<p>State policymakers, no less than their federal counterparts, retain broad discretion to make \"policy decisions\" concerning state spending \"in different ways . . . depending on their perceptions of wise state fiscal policy and myriad other circumstances.\" <i>ASARCO, supra,</i> at 615 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). Federal courts may not assume a particular exercise of this state fiscal discretion in establishing standing; a party seeking federal jurisdiction cannot rely on such \"[s]peculative inferences . . . to connect [his] injury to the challenged actions of [the defendant],\" <i>Simon,</i> 426 U. S., at 45; see also <i>Allen,</i> 468 U. S., at 759. Indeed, because state budgets frequently contain an array of tax and spending provisions, any number of which may be challenged on a variety of bases, affording state taxpayers standing to press such challenges simply because their tax burden gives them an interest in the state treasury would interpose the federal courts as \"`virtually continuing monitors of the wisdom and soundness'\" of state fiscal administration, contrary to the more modest role Article III envisions for federal courts. See <i>id.,</i> at 760-761 (quoting <i>Laird</i> v. <i>Tatum,</i> 408 U. S. 1, 15 (1972)).</p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we hold that state taxpayers have no standing under Article III to challenge state tax or spending decisions simply by virtue of their status as taxpayers.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*347</span> C</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that an exception to the general prohibition on taxpayer standing should exist for Commerce Clause challenges to state tax or spending decisions, analogizing their Commerce Clause claim to the Establishment Clause challenge we permitted in <i>Flast</i> v. <i>Cohen,</i> 392 U. S. 83. <i>Flast</i> held that because \"the Establishment Clause . . . specifically limit[s] the taxing and spending power conferred by Art. I, \u00a7 8,\" \"a taxpayer will have standing consistent with Article III to invoke federal judicial power when he alleges that congressional action under the taxing and spending clause is in derogation of\" the Establishment Clause. <i>Id.,</i> at 105-106. <i>Flast</i> held out the possibility that \"other specific [constitutional] limitations\" on Article I, \u00a7 8, might surmount the \"barrier to suits against Acts of Congress brought by individuals who can assert only the interest of federal taxpayers.\" 392 U. S., at 105, 85. But as plaintiffs candidly concede, \"only the Establishment Clause\" has supported federal taxpayer suits since <i>Flast.</i> Brief for Respondents 12; see <i>Bowen</i> v. <i>Kendrick,</i> 487 U. S. 589, 618 (1988) (\"Although we have considered the problem of standing and Article III limitations on federal jurisdiction many times since <i>[Flast],</i> we have consistently adhered to <i>Flast</i> and the narrow exception it created to the general rule against taxpayer standing\").</p>\n<p>Quite apart from whether the franchise tax credit is analogous to an exercise of congressional power under Article I, \u00a7 8, plaintiffs' reliance on <i>Flast</i> is misguided: Whatever rights plaintiffs have under the Commerce Clause, they are fundamentally unlike the right not to \"`contribute three pence . . . for the support of any one [religious] establishment.'\" 392 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*348</span> U. S., at 103 (quoting 2 Writings of James Madison 186 (G. Hunt ed. 1901)). Indeed, plaintiffs compare the Establishment Clause to the Commerce Clause at such a high level of generality that almost any constitutional constraint on government power would \"specifically limit\" a State's taxing and spending power for <i>Flast</i> purposes. 392 U. S., at 105; see Brief for Respondents 14 (\"In each case, the harm to be avoided by [the two Clauses] is the loss of governmental neutrality\"). And even if the two Clauses are similar in that they often implicate governments' fiscal decisions, see <i>id.,</i> at 13-14, a finding that the Commerce Clause satisfies the <i>Flast</i> test would leave no principled way of distinguishing those other constitutional provisions that we have recognized constrain governments' taxing and spending decisions, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc.</i> v. <i>Ragland,</i> 481 U. S. 221 (1987) (invalidating state sales tax under the Free Press Clause). Yet such a broad application of <i>Flast</i>'s exception to the general prohibition on taxpayer standing would be quite at odds with its narrow application in our precedent and <i>Flast</i>'s own promise that it would not transform federal courts into forums for taxpayers' \"generalized grievances.\" 392 U. S., at 106.</p>\n<p><i>Flast</i> is consistent with the principle, underlying the Article III prohibition on taxpayer suits, that a litigant may not assume a particular disposition of government funds in establishing standing. The <i>Flast</i> Court discerned in the history of the Establishment Clause \"the specific evils feared by [its drafters] that the taxing and spending power would be used to favor one religion over another or to support religion in general.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 103. The Court therefore understood the \"injury\" alleged in Establishment Clause challenges to federal spending to be the very \"extract[ion] and spen[ding]\" of \"tax money\" in aid of religion alleged by a plaintiff. <i>Id.,</i> at 106. And an injunction against the spending would of course redress <i>that</i> injury, regardless of whether lawmakers would dispose of the savings in a way <span class=\"star-pagination\">*349</span> that would benefit the taxpayer-plaintiffs personally. See <i>Valley Forge,</i> 454 U. S., at 514 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\"[T]he plaintiffs' invocation of the Establishment Clause was of decisive importance in resolving the standing issue in <i>[Flast]</i>\").</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs thus do not have state taxpayer standing on the ground that their Commerce Clause challenge is just like the Establishment Clause challenge in <i>Flast.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs also claim that their status as <i>municipal</i> taxpayers gives them standing to challenge the <i>state</i> franchise tax credit at issue here. The <i>Frothingham</i> Court noted with approval the standing of municipal residents to enjoin the \"illegal use of the moneys of a municipal corporation,\" relying on \"the peculiar relation of the corporate taxpayer to the corporation\" to distinguish such a case from the general bar on taxpayer suits. 262 U. S., at 486, 487; see <i>ASARCO,</i> 490 U. S., at 613-614 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (reiterating distinction). Plaintiffs here challenged the municipal property tax exemption as municipal taxpayers. That challenge was rejected by the Court of Appeals on the merits, and no issue regarding plaintiffs' standing to bring it has been raised. In plaintiffs' challenge to the state franchise tax credit, however, they identify no municipal action contributing to any claimed injury. Instead, they try to leverage the notion of municipal taxpayer standing beyond challenges to municipal action, in two ways.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>First, plaintiffs claim that because state law requires revenues from the franchise tax to be distributed to local governments, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 5733.12 (Lexis 2005), the award of a credit to DaimlerChrysler reduced such distributions and thus depleted the funds of \"local governments to which Respondents pay taxes.\" Brief for Respondents 16. But plaintiffs' challenge is still to the state law and state <span class=\"star-pagination\">*350</span> decision, not those of their municipality. We have already explained why a state taxpayer lacks standing to challenge a state fiscal decision on the grounds that it might affect his tax liability. All plaintiffs have done in recasting their claims as ones brought by municipal taxpayers whose municipalities receive funding from the State\u0097the level of which might be affected by the same state fiscal decision\u0097is introduce yet another level of conjecture to their already hypothetical claim of injury.</p>\n<p>And in fact events have highlighted the peril of assuming that any revenue increase resulting from a taxpayer suit will be put to a particular use. Ohio's General Assembly suspended the statutory budget mechanism that distributes franchise tax revenues to local governments in 2001 and again in its subsequent biennial budgets.

Any effect that enjoining DaimlerChrysler's credit will have on municipal funds, therefore, will not result from automatic operation of a statutory formula, but from a hypothesis that the state government will choose to direct the supposed revenue from the restored franchise tax to municipalities. This is precisely the sort of conjecture we may not entertain in assessing standing. See <i>ASARCO, supra,</i> at 614 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The second way plaintiffs seek to leverage their standing to challenge the municipal property tax exemption into a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*351</span> challenge to the franchise tax credit is by relying on <i>Mine Workers</i> v. <i>Gibbs,</i> 383 U. S. 715 (1966). According to plaintiffs, the \"supplemental jurisdiction\" recognized in that case supports jurisdiction over all their claims, once the District Court determined they had standing to challenge the property tax exemption. Brief for Respondents 17-18.</p>\n<p><i>Gibbs</i> held that federal-question jurisdiction over a claim may authorize a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over state-law claims that may be viewed as part of the same case because they \"derive from a common nucleus of operative fact\" as the federal claim. 383 U. S., at 725. Plaintiffs assume that <i>Gibbs</i> stands for the proposition that federal jurisdiction extends to all claims sufficiently related to a claim within Article III to be part of the same case, regardless of the nature of the deficiency that would keep the former claims out of federal court if presented on their own.</p>\n<p>Our general approach to the application of <i>Gibbs,</i> however, has been markedly more cautious. For example, as a matter of statutory construction of the pertinent jurisdictional provisions, we refused to extend <i>Gibbs</i> to allow claims to be asserted against nondiverse parties when jurisdiction was based on diversity, see <i>Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co.</i> v. <i>Kroger,</i> 437 U. S. 365 (1978), and we refused to extend <i>Gibbs</i> to authorize supplemental jurisdiction over claims that do not satisfy statutory amount-in-controversy requirements, see <i>Finley</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 490 U. S. 545 (1989). As the Court explained just last Term, \"[w]e have not . . . applied <i>Gibbs</i>' expansive interpretive approach to other aspects of the jurisdictional statutes.\" <i>Exxon Mobil Corp.</i> v. <i>Allapattah Services, Inc.,</i> 545 U. S. 546, 553 (2005) (applying 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1367, enacted in 1990, to allow a federal court in a diversity action to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over additional diverse plaintiffs whose claims failed to meet the amount-in-controversy threshold).</p>\n<p>What we have never done is apply the rationale of <i>Gibbs</i> to permit a federal court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction <span class=\"star-pagination\">*352</span> over a claim that does not itself satisfy those elements of the Article III inquiry, such as constitutional standing, that \"serv[e] to identify those disputes which are appropriately resolved through the judicial process.\" <i>Whitmore,</i> 495 U. S., at 155. We see no reason to read the language of <i>Gibbs</i> so broadly, particularly since our standing cases confirm that a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press. See <i>Allen,</i> 468 U. S., at 752 (\"[T]he standing inquiry requires careful judicial examination of a complaint's allegations to ascertain whether the particular plaintiff is entitled to an adjudication of the <i>particular claims</i> asserted\" (emphasis added)). We have insisted, for instance, that \"a plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each form of relief sought.\" <i>Laidlaw,</i> 528 U. S., at 185; see <i>Los Angeles</i> v. <i>Lyons,</i> 461 U. S. 95, 109 (1983). But if standing were commutative, as plaintiffs claim, this insistence would make little sense when all claims for relief derive from a \"common nucleus of operative fact,\" as they certainly appear to have in both <i>Laidlaw, supra,</i> at 175-179, and <i>Lyons, supra,</i> at 97-98.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' reading of <i>Gibbs</i> to allow standing as to one claim to suffice for all claims arising from the same \"nucleus of operative fact\" would have remarkable implications. The doctrines of mootness, ripeness, and political question all originate in Article III's \"case\" or \"controversy\" language, no less than standing does. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>National Park Hospitality Assn.</i> v. <i>Department of Interior,</i> 538 U. S. 803, 808 (2003) (ripeness); <i>Arizonans for Official English</i> v. <i>Arizona,</i> 520 U. S. 43, 67 (1997) (mootness); <i>Reservists Comm. to Stop the War,</i> 418 U. S., at 215 (political question). Yet if <i>Gibbs</i>' \"common nucleus\" formulation announced a new definition of \"case\" or \"controversy\" for all Article III purposes, a federal court would be free to entertain moot or unripe claims, or claims presenting a political question, if they \"derived from\" the same \"operative fact[s]\" as another federal claim suffering <span class=\"star-pagination\">*353</span> from none of these defects. Plaintiffs' reading of <i>Gibbs,</i> therefore, would amount to a significant revision of our precedent interpreting Article III. With federal courts thus deciding issues they would not otherwise be authorized to decide, the \"`tripartite allocation of power'\" that Article III is designed to maintain, <i>Valley Forge,</i> 454 U. S., at 474, would quickly erode; our emphasis on the standing requirement's role in maintaining this separation would be rendered hollow rhetoric. As we have explained, \"[t]he actual-injury requirement would hardly serve the purpose . . . of preventing courts from undertaking tasks assigned to the political branches[,] if once a plaintiff demonstrated harm from one particular inadequacy in government administration, the court were authorized to remedy <i>all</i> inadequacies in that administration.\" <i>Lewis</i> v. <i>Casey,</i> 518 U. S. 343, 357 (1996).</p>\n<p><i>Lewis</i> emphasized that \"[t]he remedy must of course be limited to the inadequacy that produced the injury in fact that the plaintiff has established.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Plaintiffs' theory of ancillary standing would contravene this principle. Plaintiffs failed to establish Article III injury with respect to their <i>state</i> taxes, and even if they did do so with respect to their <i>municipal</i> taxes, that injury does not entitle them to seek a remedy as to the state taxes. As the Court summed up the point in <i>Lewis,</i> \"standing is not dispensed in gross.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 358, n. 6.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*354</span> * * *</h2>\n<p>All the theories plaintiffs have offered to support their standing to challenge the franchise tax credit are unavailing. Because plaintiffs have no standing to challenge that credit, the lower courts erred by considering their claims against it on the merits. The judgment of the Sixth Circuit is therefore vacated in part, and the cases are remanded for dismissal of plaintiffs' challenge to the franchise tax credit.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE GINSBURG, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>Today's decision, the Court rightly points out, is solidly grounded in longstanding precedent, <i>Frothingham</i> v. <i>Mellon,</i> decided with <i>Massachusetts</i> v. <i>Mellon</i>, 262 U. S. 447 (1923), and <i>Doremus</i> v. <i>Board of Ed. of Hawthorne,</i> 342 U. S. 429 (1952), decisions that antedate current jurisprudence on standing to sue. See <i>ante,</i> at 343, 345. <i>Frothingham</i> held nonjusticiable a federal taxpayer's suit challenging a federal-spending program. See 262 U. S., at 487 (describing taxpayer's interest as \"minute and indeterminable\"). <i>Doremus</i> applied <i>Frothingham</i>'s reasoning to a state taxpayer's suit. 342 U. S., at 434. These decisions exclude from federal-court cognizance claims, not delineated by Congress, presenting generalized grievances. An exception to <i>Frothingham</i>'s rule, recognized post-<i>Doremus</i> in <i>Flast</i> v. <i>Cohen,</i> 392 U. S. 83 (1968), covers certain alleged violations of the Establishment Clause. The <i>Flast</i> exception has not been extended to other areas. See <i>Bowen</i> v. <i>Kendrick,</i> 487 U. S. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*355</span> 589, 618 (1988); cf. Enrich, Saving the States from Themselves: Commerce Clause Constraints on State Tax Incentives for Business, 110 Harv. L. Rev. 377, 417-418 (1996).</p>\n<p>One can accept, as I do, the nonjusticiability of <i>Frothingham</i>-type federal and state taxpayer suits in federal court without endorsing as well the limitations on standing later declared in <i>Simon</i> v. <i>Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization,</i> 426 U. S. 26 (1976) <i>(EKWRO); </i><i>Valley Forge Christian College</i> v. <i>Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,</i> 454 U. S. 464 (1982); <i>Allen</i> v. <i>Wright,</i> 468 U. S. 737 (1984); and <i>Lujan</i> v. <i>Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U. S. 555 (1992). See <i>EKWRO,</i> 426 U. S., at 54-66 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment); <i>Valley Forge,</i> 454 U. S., at 513-515 (Stevens, J., dissenting); <i>Allen,</i> 468 U. S., at 783-795 (same), and the overturned Court of Appeals opinion, <i>Wright</i> v. <i>Regan,</i> 656 F. 2d 820, 828-832 (CADC 1981) (Ginsburg, J.); <i>Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.

See \u00a7\u00a7 5733.01(G), 5733.33(B)(1) (Lexis 2005). Where relevant, therefore, the citations in this opinion are to the statutes in effect at the time DaimlerChrysler made its investment.</p>\n<p>[2]  Other plaintiffs were residents of Toledo who claimed they were injured because they were displaced by the DaimlerChrysler expansion and Michigan residents who claimed injury because DaimlerChrysler would have expanded its operations in Michigan but for the Ohio investment tax credit. Plaintiffs neither identified these allegations as a basis for standing in their merits brief before this Court nor referred to them at oral argument. Any argument based on these allegations is therefore abandoned. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>International Business Machines Corp.,</i> 517 U. S. 843, 855, and n. 3 (1996).</p>\n<p>[3]  Because defendants removed the case from state court to District Court, plaintiffs were not initially the parties that invoked federal jurisdiction. Indeed, plaintiffs initially expressed doubts as to their standing. Nonetheless, because \"[w]e presume that federal courts lack jurisdiction unless the contrary appears affirmatively from the record,\" <i>Renne</i> v. <i>Geary,</i> 501 U. S. 312, 316 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted), the party asserting federal jurisdiction when it is challenged has the burden of establishing it. Whatever the parties' previous positions on the propriety of a federal forum, plaintiffs, as the parties seeking to establish federal jurisdiction, must make the showings required for standing.</p>\n<p>[4]  The majority of the Courts of Appeals to have considered the issue have reached a similar conclusion. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Booth</i> v. <i>Hvass,</i> 302 F. 3d 849 (CA8 2002); <i>Board of Ed. of Mt. Sinai Union Free School Dist.</i> v. <i>New York State Teachers Retirement System,</i> 60 F. 3d 106 (CA2 1995); <i>Colorado Taxpayers Union, Inc.</i> v. <i>Romer,</i> 963 F. 2d 1394 (CA10 1992); <i>Taub</i> v. <i>Kentucky,</i> 842 F. 2d 912 (CA6 1988); <i>Korioth</i> v. <i>Briscoe,</i> 523 F. 2d 1271 (CA5 1975); but cf. <i>Arakaki</i> v. <i>Lingle,</i> 423 F. 3d 954, 967-969 (CA9 2005) (finding state taxpayer standing in light of <i>Hoohuli</i> v. <i>Ariyoshi,</i> 741 F. 2d 1169 (CA9 1984), but noting that Justice Kennedy's opinion in <i>ASARCO Inc.</i> v. <i>Kadish,</i> 490 U. S. 605 (1989), would \"carry persuasive value\" absent <i>Hoohuli</i>).</p>\n<p>[5]  In defending the contrary position, plaintiffs rely on three cases from the Courts of Appeals. But two of those cases hold only that, once a litigant has standing to request invalidation of a particular agency action, it may do so by identifying all grounds on which the agency may have \"`failed to comply with its statutory mandate.'\" <i>Sierra Club</i> v. <i>Adams,</i> 578 F. 2d 389, 392 (CADC 1978) (quoting <i>Sierra Club</i> v. <i>Morton,</i> 405 U. S. 727, 737 (1972)); see also <i>Iowa Independent Bankers</i> v. <i>Board of Governors of Fed. Reserve,</i> 511 F. 2d 1288, 1293-1294 (CADC 1975). They do not establish that the litigant can, by virtue of his standing to challenge one government action, challenge other governmental actions that did not injure him. In the third case, the Court of Appeals relied substantially on the fact that \"all courts possess an inherent power to prevent unprofessional conduct by those attorneys who are practicing before them\" in allowing the Government to contest the division of a damages award it was ordered to pay between a plaintiff and his attorney. <i>Jackson</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 881 F. 2d 707, 710, 711 (CA9 1989). That situation is rather far afield from the question before us.</p>\n\n</div>",
