Jones.</i><sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p>JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In <i>Cohens</i> v. <i>Virginia</i><i>,</i> Chief Justice Marshall famously cautioned: \"It is most true that this Court will not take jurisdiction if it should not: but it is equally true, that it must take jurisdiction if it should. . . . We have no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*299</span> usurp that which is not given.\" 6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821). Among longstanding limitations on federal jurisdiction otherwise properly exercised are the so-called \"domestic relations\" and \"probate\" exceptions. Neither is compelled by the text of the Constitution or federal statute. Both are judicially created doctrines stemming in large measure from misty understandings of English legal history. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Atwood, Domestic Relations Cases in Federal Court: Toward a Principled Exercise of Jurisdiction, 35 Hastings L. J. 571, 584-588 (1984); <i>Spindel</i> v. <i>Spindel,</i> 283 F. Supp. 797, 802 (EDNY 1968) (collecting cases and commentary revealing vulnerability of historical explanation for domestic relations exception); Winkler, The Probate Jurisdiction of the Federal Courts, 14 Probate L. J. 77, 125-126, and n. 256 (1997) (describing historical explanation for probate exception as \"an exercise in mythography\"). In the years following Marshall's 1821 pronouncement, courts have sometimes lost sight of his admonition and have rendered decisions expansively interpreting the two exceptions. In <i>Ankenbrandt</i> v. <i>Richards,</i> 504 U. S. 689 (1992), this Court reined in the \"domestic relations exception.\" Earlier, in <i>Markham</i> v. <i>Allen,</i> 326 U. S. 490 (1946), the Court endeavored similarly to curtail the \"probate exception.\"</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Ninth Circuit in the instant case read the probate exception broadly to exclude from the federal courts' adjudicatory authority \"not only direct challenges to a will or trust, but also questions which would ordinarily be decided by a probate court in determining the validity of the decedent's estate planning instrument.\" 392 F. 3d 1118, 1133 (2004). The Court of Appeals further held that a State's vesting of exclusive jurisdiction over probate matters in a special court strips federal courts of jurisdiction to entertain any \"probate related matter,\" including claims respecting \"tax liability, debt, gift, [or] tort.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1136. We hold that the Ninth Circuit had no warrant from Congress, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*300</span> or from decisions of this Court, for its sweeping extension of the probate exception.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner, Vickie Lynn Marshall (Vickie), also known as Anna Nicole Smith, is the surviving widow of J. Howard Marshall II (J. Howard). Vickie and J. Howard met in October 1991. After a courtship lasting more than two years, they were married on June 27, 1994. J. Howard died on August 4, 1995. Although he lavished gifts and significant sums of money on Vickie during their courtship and marriage, J. Howard did not include anything for Vickie in his will. According to Vickie, J. Howard intended to provide for her financial security through a gift in the form of a \"catchall\" trust.</p>\n<p>Respondent, E. Pierce Marshall (Pierce), one of J. Howard's sons, was the ultimate beneficiary of J. Howard's estate plan, which consisted of a living trust and a \"pourover\" will. Under the terms of the will, all of J. Howard's assets not already included in the trust were to be transferred to the trust upon his death.</p>\n<p>Competing claims regarding J. Howard's fortune ignited proceedings in both state and federal courts. In January 1996, while J. Howard's estate was subject to ongoing proceedings in Probate Court in Harris County, Texas, Vickie filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101 <i>et seq.,</i> in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California. See 275 B. R. 5, 8 (CD Cal. 2002). In June 1996, Pierce filed a proof of claim in the federal bankruptcy proceeding, <i>id.,</i> at 9; see 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 501, alleging that Vickie had defamed him when, shortly after J. Howard's death, lawyers representing Vickie told members of the press that Pierce had engaged in forgery, fraud, and overreaching to gain control of his father's assets, 275 B. R., at 9. Pierce sought a declaration that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*301</span> the debt he asserted in that claim was not dischargeable in bankruptcy. <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[1]</sup> Vickie answered, asserting truth as a defense. She also filed counterclaims, among them a claim that Pierce had tortiously interfered with a gift she expected. <i>Ibid.;</i> see App. 23-25. Vickie alleged that Pierce prevented the transfer of his father's intended gift to her by, among other things: effectively imprisoning J. Howard against his wishes; surrounding him with hired guards for the purpose of preventing personal contact between him and Vickie; making misrepresentations to J. Howard; and transferring property against J. Howard's expressed wishes. <i>Id.,</i> at 24.</p>\n<p>Vickie's tortious interference counterclaim turned her objection to Pierce's claim into an adversary proceeding. <i>Id.,</i> at 39; see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3007. In that proceeding, the Bankruptcy Court granted summary judgment in favor of Vickie on Pierce's claim and, after a trial on the merits, entered judgment for Vickie on her tortious interference counterclaim. See 253 B. R. 550, 558-559 (2000). The Bankruptcy Court also held that both Vickie's objection to Pierce's claim and Vickie's counterclaim qualified as \"core proceedings\" under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 157, which meant that the court had authority to enter a final judgment disposing of those claims. See 257 B. R. 35, 39-40 (2000). The court awarded Vickie compensatory damages of more than $449 million\u0097less whatever she recovered in the ongoing probate action in Texas\u0097as well as $25 million in punitive damages. <i>Id.,</i> at 40.</p>\n<p>Pierce filed a post-trial motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, asserting that Vickie's tortious interference claim could be tried only in the Texas probate proceedings. <i>Id.,</i> at 36. The Bankruptcy Court held that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*302</span> \"the `probate exception' argument was waived\" because it was not timely raised. <i>Id.,</i> at 39. Relying on this Court's decision in <i>Markham,</i> the court observed that a federal court has jurisdiction to \"adjudicate rights in probate property, so long as its final judgment does not undertake to interfere with the state court's possession of the property.\" 257 B. R., at 38 (citing <i>Markham,</i> 326 U. S., at 494).</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in the Texas Probate Court, Pierce sought a declaration that the living trust and his father's will were valid. 392 F. 3d, at 1124-1125. Vickie, in turn, challenged the validity of the will and filed a tortious interference claim against Pierce, <i>ibid.,</i> but voluntarily dismissed both claims once the Bankruptcy Court entered its judgment, <i>id.,</i> at 1128. Following a jury trial, the Probate Court declared the living trust and J. Howard's will valid. <i>Id.,</i> at 1129.</p>\n<p>Back in the federal forum, Pierce sought district-court review of the Bankruptcy Court's judgment. While rejecting the Bankruptcy Court's determination that Pierce had forfeited any argument based on the probate exception, the District Court held that the exception did not reach Vickie's claim. 264 B. R. 609, 619-625 (CD Cal. 2001). The Bankruptcy Court \"did not assert jurisdiction generally over the probate proceedings . . . or take control over [the] estate's assets,\" the District Court observed, <i>id.,</i> at 621, \"[t]hus, the probate exception would bar federal jurisdiction over Vickie's counterclaim only if such jurisdiction would `interfere' with the probate proceedings,\" <i>ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Markham,</i> 326 U. S., at 494). Federal jurisdiction would not \"interfere\" with the probate proceedings, the District Court concluded, because: (1) success on Vickie's counterclaim did not necessitate any declaration that J. Howard's will was invalid, 264 B. R., at 621; and (2) under Texas law, probate courts do not have exclusive jurisdiction to entertain claims of the kind asserted in Vickie's counterclaim, <i>id.,</i> at 622-625.</p>\n<p>The District Court also held that Vickie's claim did not qualify as a \"core proceedin[g] arising under title 11, or arising in a case under title 11.\" 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 157(b)(1); see 264 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*303</span> B. R., at 625-632. A bankruptcy court may exercise plenary power only over \"core proceedings.\" See \u00a7 157(b)-(c).<sup>[2]</sup> In noncore matters, a bankruptcy court may not enter final judgment; it has authority to issue only proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, which are reviewed <i>de novo</i> by the district court. See \u00a7 157(c)(1). Accordingly, the District Court treated the Bankruptcy Court's judgment as \"proposed[,] rather than final,\" and undertook a \"comprehensive, complete, and independent review of\" the Bankruptcy Court's determinations. <i>Id.,</i> at 633.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*304</span> Adopting and supplementing the Bankruptcy Court's findings, the District Court determined that Pierce had tortiously interfered with Vickie's expectancy. Specifically, the District Court found that J. Howard directed his lawyers to prepare an <i>inter vivos</i> trust for Vickie consisting of half the appreciation of his assets from the date of their marriage. See 275 B. R., at 25-30, 51-53. It further found that Pierce conspired to suppress or destroy the trust instrument and to strip J. Howard of his assets by backdating, altering, and otherwise falsifying documents, arranging for surveillance of J. Howard and Vickie, and presenting documents to J. Howard under false pretenses. See <i>id.,</i> at 36-50, 57-58; see also 253 B. R., at 554-556, 559-560. Based on these findings, the District Court awarded Vickie some $44.3 million in compensatory damages. 275 B. R., at 53-57. In addition, finding \"overwhelming\" evidence of Pierce's \"willfulness, maliciousness, and fraud,\" the District Court awarded an equal amount in punitive damages. <i>Id.,</i> at 57-58.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. The appeals court recognized that Vickie's claim \"does not involve the administration of an estate, the probate of a will, or any other purely probate matter.\" 392 F. 3d, at 1133. Nevertheless, the court held that the probate exception bars federal jurisdiction in this case. In the Ninth Circuit's view, a claim falls within the probate exception if it raises \"questions which would ordinarily be decided by a probate court in determining the validity of the decedent's estate planning instrument,\" whether those questions involve \"fraud, undue influence[, or] tortious interference with the testator's intent.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit was also of the view that state-court delineation of a probate court's exclusive adjudicatory authority could control federal subject-matter jurisdiction. In this regard, the Court of Appeals stated: \"Where a state has relegated jurisdiction over probate matters to a special court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*305</span> and [the] state's trial courts of general jurisdiction do not have jurisdiction to hear probate matters, then the federal courts also lack jurisdiction over probate matters.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1136. Noting that \"[t]he [P]robate [C]ourt ruled it had exclusive jurisdiction over all of Vickie[`s] claims,\" the Ninth Circuit held that \"ruling . . . binding on the United States [D]istrict [C]ourt.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (citing <i>Durfee</i> v. <i>Duke,</i> 375 U. S. 106, 115-116 (1963)).</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 545 U. S. 1165 (2005), to resolve the apparent confusion among federal courts concerning the scope of the probate exception. Satisfied that the instant case does not fall within the ambit of the narrow exception recognized by our decisions, we reverse the Ninth Circuit's judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>In <i>Ankenbrandt</i> v. <i>Richards,</i> 504 U. S. 689 (1992), we addressed both the derivation and the limits of the \"domestic relations exception\" to the exercise of federal jurisdiction. Carol Ankenbrandt, a citizen of Missouri, brought suit in Federal District Court on behalf of her daughters, naming as defendants their father (Ankenbrandt's former husband) and his female companion, both citizens of Louisiana. <i>Id.,</i> at 691. Ankenbrandt's complaint sought damages for the defendants' alleged sexual and physical abuse of the children. <i>Ibid.</i> Federal jurisdiction was predicated on diversity of citizenship. <i>Ibid.</i> (citing 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1332). The District Court dismissed the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, holding that Ankenbrandt's suit fell within \"the `domestic relations' exception to diversity jurisdiction.\" 504 U. S., at 692. The Court of Appeals agreed and affirmed. <i>Ibid.</i> We reversed the Court of Appeals' judgment. <i>Id.,</i> at 706-707.</p>\n<p>Holding that the District Court improperly refrained from exercising jurisdiction over Ankenbrandt's tort claim, <i>id.,</i> at 704, we traced explanation of the current domestic relations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*306</span> exception to <i>Barber</i> v. <i>Barber,</i> 21 How. 582 (1859). See <i>Ankenbrandt,</i> 504 U. S., at 693-695. In <i>Barber,</i> the Court upheld federal-court authority, in a diversity case, to enforce an alimony award decreed by a state court. In dicta, however, the <i>Barber</i> Court announced\u0097without citation or discussion\u0097 that federal courts lack jurisdiction over suits for divorce or the allowance of alimony. 21 How., at 584-589; see <i>Ankenbrandt,</i> 504 U. S., at 693-695.</p>\n<p>Finding no Article III impediment to federal-court jurisdiction in domestic relations cases, <i>id.,</i> at 695-697, the Court in <i>Ankenbrandt</i> anchored the exception in Congress' original provision for diversity jurisdiction, <i>id.,</i> at 698-701. Beginning at the beginning, the Court recalled:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The Judiciary Act of 1789 provided that `the circuit courts shall have original cognizance, concurrent with the courts of the several States, of <i>all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity, where the matter in dispute exceeds,</i> exclusive of costs, the sum or value of <i>five hundred dollars,</i> and . . . an alien is a party, or the suit is <i>between a citizen of the State where the suit is brought, and a citizen of another State.</i>'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 698 (quoting Act of Sept. 24, 1789, \u00a7 11, 1 Stat. 78; emphasis added in <i>Ankenbrandt</i>).</blockquote>\n<p>The defining phrase, \"all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity,\" the Court stressed, remained in successive statutory provisions for diversity jurisdiction until 1948, when Congress adopted the more economical phrase, \"all civil actions.\" 504 U. S., at 698; 1948 Judicial Code and Judiciary Act, 62 Stat. 930, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n<p>The <i>Barber</i> majority, we acknowledged in <i>Ankenbrandt,</i> did not expressly tie its announcement of a domestic relations exception to the text of the diversity statute. 504 U. S., at 698. But the dissenters in that case made the connection. They stated that English courts of chancery lacked <span class=\"star-pagination\">*307</span> authority to issue divorce and alimony decrees. Because \"the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States in chancery is bounded by that of the chancery in England,\" <i>Barber,</i> 21 How., at 605 (opinion of Daniel, J.), the dissenters reasoned, our federal courts similarly lack authority to decree divorces or award alimony, <i>ibid.</i> Such relief, in other words, would not fall within the diversity statute's original grant of jurisdiction over \"all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity.\" We concluded in <i>Ankenbrandt</i> that \"it may be inferred fairly that the jurisdictional limitation recognized by the <i>[Barber]</i> Court rested on th[e] statutory basis\" indicated by the dissenters in that case. 504 U. S., at 699.</p>\n<p>We were \"content\" in <i>Ankenbrandt</i> \"to rest our conclusion that a domestic relations exception exists as a matter of statutory construction not on the accuracy of the historical justifications on which [the exception] was seemingly based.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 700. \"[R]ather,\" we relied on \"Congress' apparent acceptance of this construction of the diversity jurisdiction provisions in the years prior to 1948, when the statute limited jurisdiction to `suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting 1 Stat. 78). We further determined that Congress did not intend to terminate the exception in 1948 when it \"replace[d] the law/equity distinction with the phrase `all civil actions.'\" 504 U. S., at 700. Absent contrary indications, we presumed that Congress meant to leave undisturbed \"the Court's nearly century-long interpretation\" of the diversity statute \"to contain an exception for certain domestic relations matters.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>We nevertheless emphasized in <i>Ankenbrandt</i> that the exception covers only \"a narrow range of domestic relations issues.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 701. The <i>Barber</i> Court itself, we reminded, \"sanctioned the exercise of federal jurisdiction over the enforcement of an alimony decree that had been properly obtained in a state court of competent jurisdiction.\" 504 U. S., at 702. Noting that some lower federal courts had applied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*308</span> the domestic relations exception \"well beyond the circumscribed situations posed by <i>Barber</i> and its progeny,\" <i>id.,</i> at 701, we clarified that only \"divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees\" remain outside federal jurisdictional bounds, <i>id.,</i> at 703, 704. While recognizing the \"special proficiency developed by state tribunals . . . in handling issues that arise in the granting of [divorce, alimony, and child custody] decrees,\" <i>id.,</i> at 704, we viewed federal courts as equally equipped to deal with complaints alleging the commission of torts, <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Federal jurisdiction in this case is premised on 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1334, the statute vesting in federal district courts jurisdiction in bankruptcy cases and related proceedings. Decisions of this Court have recognized a \"probate exception,\" kin to the domestic relations exception, to otherwise proper federal jurisdiction. See <i>Markham,</i> 326 U. S., at 494; see also <i>Sutton</i> v. <i>English,</i> 246 U. S. 199 (1918); <i>Waterman</i> v. <i>Canal-Louisiana Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 215 U. S. 33 (1909). Like the domestic relations exception, the probate exception has been linked to language contained in the Judiciary Act of 1789.</p>\n<p><i>Markham,</i> the Court's most recent and pathmarking pronouncement on the probate exception, stated that \"the equity jurisdiction conferred by the Judiciary Act of 1789 . . ., which is that of the English Court of Chancery in 1789, did not extend to probate matters.\" 326 U. S., at 494. See generally Nicolas, Fighting the Probate Mafia: A Dissection of the Probate Exception to Federal Court Jurisdiction, 74 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1479 (2001). As in <i>Ankenbrandt,</i> so in this case, \"[w]e have no occasion . . . to join the historical debate\" over the scope of English chancery jurisdiction in 1789, 504 U. S., at 699, for Vickie Marshall's claim falls far outside the bounds of the probate exception described in <i>Markham.</i> We therefore need not consider in this case whether there exists any <span class=\"star-pagination\">*309</span> uncodified probate exception to federal bankruptcy jurisdiction under \u00a7 1334.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>Markham,</i> the plaintiff Alien Property Custodian <sup>[4]</sup> commenced suit in Federal District Court against an executor and resident heirs to determine the Custodian's asserted rights regarding a decedent's estate. 326 U. S., at 491-492. Jurisdiction was predicated on \u00a7 24(1) of the Judicial Code, now 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1345, which provides for federal jurisdiction over suits brought by an officer of the United States. At the time the federal suit commenced, the estate was undergoing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*310</span> probate administration in a state court. The Custodian had issued an order vesting in himself all right, title, and interest of German legatees. He sought and gained in the District Court a judgment determining that the resident heirs had no interest in the estate, and that the Custodian, substituting himself for the German legatees, was entitled to the entire net estate, including specified real estate passing under the will.</p>\n<p>Reversing the Ninth Circuit, which had ordered the case dismissed for want of federal subject-matter jurisdiction, this Court held that federal jurisdiction was properly invoked. The Court first stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"It is true that a federal court has no jurisdiction to probate a will or administer an estate . . . . But it has been established by a long series of decisions of this Court that federal courts of equity have jurisdiction to entertain suits `in favor of creditors, legatees and heirs' and other claimants against a decedent's estate `to establish their claims' so long as the federal court does not interfere with the probate proceedings or assume general jurisdiction of the probate or control of the property in the custody of the state court.\" 326 U. S., at 494 (quoting <i>Waterman,</i> 215 U. S., at 43).</blockquote>\n<p>Next, the Court described a probate exception of distinctly limited scope:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[W]hile a federal court may not exercise its jurisdiction to disturb or affect the possession of property in the custody of a state court, . . . it may exercise its jurisdiction to adjudicate rights in such property where the final judgment does not undertake to interfere with the state court's possession save to the extent that the state court is bound by the judgment to recognize the right adjudicated by the federal court.\" 326 U. S., at 494.</blockquote>\n<p>The first of the above-quoted passages from <i>Markham</i> is not a model of clear statement. The Court observed that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*311</span> federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain suits to determine the rights of creditors, legatees, heirs, and other claimants against a decedent's estate, \"so long as the federal court does not <i>interfere with the probate proceedings.</i>\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). Lower federal courts have puzzled over the meaning of the words \"interfere with the probate proceedings,\" and some have read those words to block federal jurisdiction over a range of matters well beyond probate of a will or administration of a decedent's estate. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Mangieri</i> v. <i>Mangieri,</i> 226 F. 3d 1, 2-3 (CA1 2000) (breach of fiduciary duty by executor); <i>Golden ex rel. Golden</i> v. <i>Golden,</i> 382 F. 3d 348, 360-362 (CA3 2004) (same); <i>Lepard</i> v. <i>NBD Bank, Div. of Bank One,</i> 384 F. 3d 232, 234-237 (CA6 2004) (breach of fiduciary duty by trustee); <i>Storm</i> v. <i>Storm,</i> 328 F. 3d 941, 943-945 (CA7 2003) (probate exception bars claim that plaintiff's father tortiously interfered with plaintiff's inheritance by persuading trust grantor to amend irrevocable <i>inter vivos</i> trust); <i>Rienhardt</i> v. <i>Kelly,</i> 164 F. 3d 1296, 1300-1301 (CA10 1999) (probate exception bars claim that defendants exerted undue influence on testator and thereby tortiously interfered with plaintiff's expected inheritance).</p>\n<p>We read <i>Markham</i>'s enigmatic words, in sync with the second above-quoted passage, to proscribe \"disturb[ing] or affect[ing] the possession of property in the custody of a state court.\" 326 U. S., at 494. True, that reading renders the first-quoted passage in part redundant, but redundancy in this context, we do not doubt, is preferable to incoherence. In short, we comprehend the \"interference\" language in <i>Markham</i> as essentially a reiteration of the general principle that, when one court is exercising <i>in rem</i> jurisdiction over a <i>res,</i> a second court will not assume <i>in rem</i> jurisdiction over the same <i>res.</i> See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Penn General Casualty Co.</i> v. <i>Pennsylvania ex rel. Schnader,</i> 294 U. S. 189, 195-196 (1935); <i>Waterman,</i> 215 U. S., at 45-46. Thus, the probate exception reserves to state probate courts the probate or annulment of a will and the administration of a decedent's estate; it also <span class=\"star-pagination\">*312</span> precludes federal courts from endeavoring to dispose of property that is in the custody of a state probate court. But it does not bar federal courts from adjudicating matters outside those confines and otherwise within federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>As the Court of Appeals correctly observed, Vickie's claim does not \"involve the administration of an estate, the probate of a will, or any other purely probate matter.\" 392 F. 3d, at 1133. Provoked by Pierce's claim in the bankruptcy proceedings, Vickie's claim, like Carol Ankenbrandt's, alleges a widely recognized tort. See <i>King</i> v. <i>Acker,</i> 725 S. W. 2d 750, 754 (Tex. App. 1987); 4 Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 774B (1977) (\"One who by fraud, duress or other tortious means intentionally prevents another from receiving from a third person an inheritance or gift that [s]he would otherwise have received is subject to liability to the other for loss of the inheritance or gift.\"). Vickie seeks an <i>in personam</i> judgment against Pierce, not the probate or annulment of a will. Cf. <i>Sutton,</i> 246 U. S., at 208 (suit to annul a will found \"supplemental to the proceedings for probate of the will\" and therefore not cognizable in federal court). Nor does she seek to reach a <i>res</i> in the custody of a state court. See <i>Markham,</i> 326 U. S., at 494.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, no \"sound policy considerations\" militate in favor of extending the probate exception to cover the case at hand. Cf. <i>Ankenbrandt,</i> 504 U. S., at 703. Trial courts, both federal and state, often address conduct of the kind Vickie alleges. State probate courts possess no \"special proficiency . . . in handling [such] issues.\" Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 704.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals advanced an alternate basis for its conclusion that the federal courts lack jurisdiction over Vickie's claim. Noting that the Texas Probate Court \"ruled it had exclusive jurisdiction over all of Vickie Lynn Marshall's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*313</span> claims against E. Pierce Marshall,\" the Ninth Circuit held that \"ruling . . . binding on the United States [D]istrict [C]ourt.\" 392 F. 3d, at 1136. We reject that determination.</p>\n<p>Texas courts have recognized a state-law tort action for interference with an expected inheritance or gift, modeled on the Restatement formulation. See <i>King,</i> 725 S. W. 2d, at 754; <i>Brandes</i> v. <i>Rice Trust, Inc.,</i> 966 S. W. 2d 144, 146-147 (Tex. App. 1998).<sup>[5]</sup> It is clear, under <i>Erie R. Co.</i> v. <i>Tompkins,</i> 304 U. S. 64 (1938), that Texas law governs the substantive elements of Vickie's tortious interference claim. It is also clear, however, that Texas may not reserve to its probate courts the exclusive right to adjudicate a transitory <span class=\"star-pagination\">*314</span> tort. We have long recognized that \"a State cannot create a transitory cause of action and at the same time destroy the right to sue on that transitory cause of action in any court having jurisdiction.\" <i>Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; R. Co.</i> v. <i>George,</i> 233 U. S. 354, 360 (1914). Jurisdiction is determined \"by the law of the court's creation and cannot be defeated by the extraterritorial operation of a [state] statute . . ., even though it created the right of action.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Directly on point, we have held that the jurisdiction of the federal courts, \"having existed from the beginning of the Federal government, [can]not be impaired by subsequent state legislation creating courts of probate.\" <i>McClellan</i> v. <i>Carland,</i> 217 U. S. 268, 281 (1910) (upholding federal jurisdiction over action by heirs of decedent, who died intestate, to determine their rights in the estate (citing <i>Waterman,</i> 215 U. S. 33)).</p>\n<p>Our decision in <i>Durfee</i> v. <i>Duke,</i> 375 U. S. 106 (1963), relied upon by the Ninth Circuit, 392 F. 3d, at 1136, is not to the contrary. <i>Durfee</i> stands only for the proposition that a state court's final judgment determining <i>its own</i> jurisdiction ordinarily qualifies for full faith and credit, so long as the jurisdictional issue was fully and fairly litigated in the court that rendered the judgment. See 375 U. S., at 111, 115. At issue here, however, is not the Texas Probate Court's jurisdiction, but the federal courts' jurisdiction to entertain Vickie's tortious interference claim. Under our federal system, Texas cannot render its probate courts exclusively competent to entertain a claim of that genre. We therefore hold that the District Court properly asserted jurisdiction over Vickie's counterclaim against Pierce.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>After determining that Vickie's claim was not a \"core proceeding,\" the District Court reviewed the case <i>de novo</i> and entered its final judgment on March 7, 2002. 275 B. R., at 5-8. The Texas Probate Court's judgment became final on February 11, 2002, nearly one month earlier. App. to Pet. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*315</span> for Cert. 41. The Court of Appeals considered only the issue of federal subject-matter jurisdiction. It did not address the question whether Vickie's claim was \"core\"; nor did it address Pierce's arguments concerning claim and issue preclusion. 392 F. 3d, at 1137. These issues remain open for consideration on remand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>The administration of decedents' estates typically is governed by rules of state law and conducted by state probate courts. Occasionally, however, disputes between interested parties arise, either in the probate proceeding itself or elsewhere, that qualify as cases or controversies that federal courts have jurisdiction to decide. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Reed</i> v. <i>Reed,</i> 404 U. S. 71 (1971). In her opinion for the Court, Justice GINSBURG has cogently explained why this is such a case. I write separately to explain why I do not believe there is any \"probate exception\" that ousts a federal court of jurisdiction it otherwise possesses.</p>\n<p>The familiar aphorism that hard cases make bad law should extend to easy cases as well. <i>Markham</i> v. <i>Allen,</i> 326 U. S. 490 (1946), like this case, was an easy case. In <i>Markham,</i> as here, it was unnecessary to question the historical or logical underpinnings of the probate exception to federal jurisdiction because, whatever the scope of the supposed exception, it did not extend to the case at hand. But <i>Markham</i>'s obiter dicta\u0097dicta that the Court now describes as redundant if not incoherent, <i>ante,</i> at 311\u0097generated both <span class=\"star-pagination\">*316</span> confusion and abdication of the obligation Chief Justice Marshall so famously articulated, see <i>Cohens</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821); see also <i>ante,</i> at 298-299. While the Court today rightly abandons much of that dicta, I would go further.</p>\n<p>The Court is content to adopt the approach it followed in <i>Ankenbrandt</i> v. <i>Richards,</i> 504 U. S. 689 (1992), and to accept as foundation for the probate exception <i>Markham</i>'s bald assertion that the English High Court of Chancery's jurisdiction did not \"extend to probate matters\" in 1789. 326 U. S., at 494; see <i>ante,</i> at 308. I would not accept that premise. Not only had the theory <i>Markham</i> espoused been only sporadically and tentatively cited as justification for the exception,<sup>[1]</sup> but the most comprehensive article on the subject has persuasively demonstrated that <i>Markham</i>'s assertion is \"an exercise in mythography.\"<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Markham</i>'s theory apparently is the source of the Court's reformulated exception, which \"reserves to state probate courts the probate or annulment of a will and the administration of a decedent's estate.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 311. Although undoubtedly narrower in scope than <i>Markham</i>'s ill-considered description of the probate carve-out, this description also <span class=\"star-pagination\">*317</span> sweeps too broadly. For the Court has correctly upheld the exercise of federal jurisdiction over actions involving the annulment of wills and the administration of decedents' estates. In <i>Gaines</i> v. <i>Fuentes,</i> 92 U. S. 10 (1876), for example, the Court held that a defendant in an action to annul a will should be permitted to remove the case to federal court. In so doing, it explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[W]henever a controversy in a suit . . . arises respecting the validity or construction of a will, or the enforcement of a decree admitting it to probate, there is no more reason why the Federal courts should not take jurisdiction of the case than there is that they should not take jurisdiction of any other controversy between the parties.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 22.</blockquote>\n<p>Likewise, in <i>Payne</i> v. <i>Hook,</i> 7 Wall. 425 (1869), the Court explained that it was \"well settled that a court of chancery, as an incident to its power to enforce trusts, and make those holding a fiduciary relation account, has jurisdiction to compel executors and administrators to account and distribute the assets in their hands.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 431. (In that same case, a federal court later appointed a Special Master to administer the estate. This Court upheld some of the Master's determinations and rejected others. See <i>Hook</i> v. <i>Payne,</i> 14 Wall. 252, 255 (1872).)</p>\n<p>To be sure, there are cases that support limitations on federal courts' jurisdiction over the probate and annulment of wills and the administration of decedents' estates. But careful examination reveals that at least most of the limitations so recognized stem not from some <i>sui generis</i> exception, but rather from generally applicable jurisdictional rules. Cf. <i>Ellis</i> v. <i>Davis,</i> 109 U. S. 485, 497 (1883) (\"Jurisdiction as to wills, and their probate as such, is neither included in nor excepted out of the grant of judicial power to the courts of the United States\"). Some of those rules, like the rule that diversity jurisdiction will not attach absent an <i>inter</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*318</span> <i>partes</i> controversy, plainly are still relevant today. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Waterman</i> v. <i>Canal-Louisiana Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 215 U. S. 33, 44-45 (1909); see also <i>id.,</i> at 46 (reaffirming the <i>in gremio legis</i> principle). Others, like the rule that a bill in equity will lie only where there is no adequate remedy elsewhere, have less straightforward application in the wake of 20th-century jurisdictional developments. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Case of Broderick's Will,</i> 21 Wall. 503, 510-512 (1875); <i>Ellis,</i> 109 U. S., at 503 (denying relief where plaintiff had \"a plain, adequate and complete remedy at law\"); see also Winkler, <i>supra</i> n. 2, at 112-113. Whatever the continuing viability of these individual rules, together they are more than adequate to the task of cabining federal courts' jurisdiction. They require no helping hand from the so-called probate exception.</p>\n<p>Rather than preserving whatever vitality that the \"exception\" has retained as a result of the <i>Markham</i> dicta, I would provide the creature with a decent burial in a grave adjacent to the resting place of the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine. See <i>Lance</i> v. <i>Dennis,</i> 546 U.

Because the Bankruptcy Court rejected Pierce's motion for mandatory abstention as untimely, 257 B.

No. 113, 65th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1917)).</p>\n<p>[5]  Texas appellate courts have on occasion held claims of tortious interference with an expected inheritance \"barred\" by a prior probate court judgment, apparently applying ordinary principles of preclusion. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Thompson</i> v. <i>Deloitte &amp; Touche,</i> 902 S. W. 2d 13, 16 (Tex. App. 1995) (final probate court judgment bars claim of tortious interference with inheritance expectancy because probate court \"necessarily found that [the decedent] signed the will with testamentary capacity, and that it reflected his intent, was not the result of coercion or undue influence, and was valid\"); <i>Neill</i> v. <i>Yett,</i> 746 S. W. 2d 32, 35-36 (Tex. App. 1988) (complaint alleging fraud and tortious interference with inheritance expectancy, filed more than two years after will was admitted to probate, was barred by both the statute of limitations and the final probate judgment, and failed to state the elements of the claim). Neither <i>Thompson</i> nor <i>Neill</i> questions the Texas trial courts' subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims in question.\n</p>\n<p>Pierce maintains that <i>Thompson, Neill,</i> and other Texas decisions support his contention that preclusion principles bar Vickie's claim. See Brief for Respondent 36-38. Vickie argues to the contrary. See Brief for Petitioner 42, n. 30 (urging that preclusion does not apply because (1) Vickie's claim was not litigated to final judgment in the Texas probate proceedings; (2) having presented her claim in the Bankruptcy Court years before she joined the Texas will contest, Vickie was not obliged to present her claim in the Texas proceedings; (3) the Bankruptcy Court's judgment preceded the Probate Court judgment; and (4) the Texas Probate Court did not have before it important evidence).

Argued February 28, 2006\u2014Decided May 1, 2006\nAmong longstanding limitations on federal-court jurisdiction otherwise\n properly exercised are the so-called \u201cdomestic relations\u201d and \u201cpro\n bate\u201d exceptions. Neither is compelled by the text of the Constitution\n or federal statute. Both are judicially created doctrines stemming in\n large measure from misty understandings of English legal history.\n In view of lower federal-court decisions expansively interpreting the\n two exceptions, this Court reined in the domestic relations exception\n in Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U. S. 689, and endeavored similarly\n to curtail the probate exception in Markham v. Allen, 326 U. S. 490.\n   Petitioner, Vickie Lynn Marshall (Vickie), a.k.a. Anna Nicole\n Smith, is the surviving widow of J. Howard Marshall II (J. Howard),\n who died without providing for Vickie in his will. According to\n Vickie, J. Howard intended to provide for her through a gift in the\n form of a \u201ccatch-all\u201d trust. Respondent, E. Pierce Marshall (Pierce),\n J. Howard\u2019s son, was the ultimate beneficiary of J. Howard\u2019s estate\n plan. While the estate was subject to ongoing Texas Probate Court\n proceedings, Vickie filed for bankruptcy in California. Pierce filed a\n proof of claim in the federal bankruptcy court, alleging that Vickie\n had defamed him when, shortly after J. Howard\u2019s death, her lawyers\n told the press that Pierce had engaged in forgery, fraud, and over\n reaching to gain control of his father\u2019s assets. Pierce sought a decla\n ration that his claim was not dischargeable in bankruptcy. Vickie\n answered, asserting truth as a defense. She also filed counterclaims,\n among them a claim that Pierce had tortiously interfered with a gift\n she expected from J. Howard. Vickie\u2019s tortious interference counter\n claim turned her objection to Pierce\u2019s claim into an adversary pro\n ceeding, see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3007, in which the Bankruptcy\n Court granted summary judgment for Vickie on Pierce\u2019s claim and,\n2                       MARSHALL v. MARSHALL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    after a trial on the merits, entered judgment for Vickie on her coun\n    terclaim. The court also held that both Vickie\u2019s objection to Pierce\u2019s\n    claim and her counterclaim qualified as \u201ccore proceedings\u201d under 28\n    U. S. C. \u00a7157, which meant that the court had authority to enter a fi\n    nal judgment disposing of those claims. It awarded Vickie substan\n    tial compensatory and punitive damages. Pierce then filed a post\n    trial motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, assert\n    ing that Vickie\u2019s tortious interference claim could be tried only in the\n    Texas probate proceedings. The Bankruptcy Court denied the mo\n    tion. Relying on Markham, the Bankruptcy Court observed that a\n    federal court has jurisdiction to adjudicate rights in probate property,\n    so long as its final judgment does not interfere with the state court\u2019s\n    possession of the property. Subsequently, the Texas Probate Court\n    declared that J. Howard\u2019s estate plan was valid.\n       Back in the federal forum, Pierce sought district-court review of the\n    Bankruptcy Court\u2019s judgment. Among other things, the District\n    Court held that the probate exception did not reach Vickie\u2019s counter\n    claim. Citing Markham, 326 U. S., at 494, the court said that the ex\n    ception would bar federal jurisdiction only if such jurisdiction would\n    \u201cinterfere\u201d with the probate proceedings. It would not do so, the court\n    concluded, because: (1) success on Vickie\u2019s counterclaim did not ne\n    cessitate any declaration that J. Howard\u2019s will was invalid, and (2)\n    under Texas law, probate courts do not have exclusive jurisdiction to\n    entertain claims of the kind Vickie\u2019s counterclaim asserted. The\n    court also held that Vickie\u2019s claim did not qualify as a \u201ccore pro\n    ceedin[g]\u201d over which a bankruptcy court may exercise plenary\n    power, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157(b)\u2013(c). Accordingly, the District Court\n    treated the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s judgment as proposed, rather than\n    final, and undertook de novo review. Adopting and supplementing\n    the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s findings, the District Court determined that\n    Pierce had tortiously interfered with Vickie\u2019s expectancy by, inter\n    alia, conspiring to suppress or destroy the inter vivos trust instru\n    ment J. Howard had directed his lawyers to prepare for Vickie, and to\n    strip J. Howard of his assets by backdating, altering, and otherwise\n    falsifying documents and presenting them to J. Howard under false\n    pretenses. The District Court awarded Vickie some $44.3 million in\n    compensatory damages and, based on \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence of\n    Pierce\u2019s willfulness, maliciousness, and fraud, an equal amount in\n    punitive damages.\n       The Ninth Circuit reversed. Although the Court of Appeals recog\n    nized that Vickie\u2019s claim does not involve the administration of an es\n    tate, the probate of a will, or any other purely probate matter, it\n    nonetheless held that the probate exception bars federal jurisdiction\n    in this case. It read the exception broadly to exclude from the federal\n                      Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)                     3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  courts\u2019 adjudicatory authority not only direct challenges to a will or\n  trust, but also questions which would ordinarily be decided by a pro\n  bate court in determining the validity of the decedent\u2019s estate plan\n  ning instrument, whether those questions involve fraud, undue influ\n  ence, or tortious interference with the testator\u2019s intent. The court\n  also held that a State\u2019s vesting of exclusive jurisdiction over probate\n  matters in a special court strips federal courts of jurisdiction to enter\n  tain any probate related matter, including claims respecting tax li\n  ability, debt, gift, and tort. Noting that the Probate Court had ruled\n  it had exclusive jurisdiction over all of Vickie\u2019s claims, the Ninth Cir\n  cuit held that ruling binding on the Federal District Court.\nHeld: The Ninth Circuit had no warrant from Congress, or from this\n Court\u2019s decisions, for its sweeping extension of the probate exception\n recognized in those decisions. Because this case does not fall within\n the exception\u2019s scope, the District Court properly asserted jurisdiction\n over Vickie\u2019s counterclaim against Pierce. Pp. 8\u201318.\n    (a) Ankenbrandt addressed the domestic relations exception\u2019s deri\n vation and limits. Among other things, the Court, 504 U. S., at 693\u2013\n 695, traced the current exception to Barber v. Barber, 21 How. 582,\n 584\u2013589, in which the Court had announced in dicta\u2014without cita\n tion or discussion\u2014that federal courts lack jurisdiction over suits for\n divorce or alimony. Finding no Article III impediment to federal-\n court jurisdiction in domestic relations cases, 504 U. S., at 695\u2013697,\n the Ankenbrandt Court, id., at 698\u2013701, anchored the exception in\n the Judiciary Act of 1789, which, until 1948, provided circuit court\n diversity jurisdiction over \u201call suits of a civil nature at common law\n or in equity.\u201d The Barber majority, the Ankenbrandt Court acknowl\n edged, 504 U. S., at 698, did not expressly tie its announcement of a\n domestic relations exception to the text of the diversity statute, but\n the Barber dissenters made the connection. Because English chan\n cery courts lacked authority to issue divorce and alimony decrees, the\n dissenters stated, United States courts similarly lacked authority to\n decree divorces or award alimony, 21 How., at 605. The Ankenbrandt\n Court was \u201ccontent\u201d \u201cto rest [its] conclusion that a domestic relations\n exception exists as a matter of statutory construction not on the accu\n racy of [Barber\u2019s] historical justifications, but, \u201crather,\u201d on \u201cCongress\u2019\n apparent acceptance of this construction of the diversity jurisdiction\n provisions in the years prior to 1948,\u201d 504 U. S., at 700. Ankenbrandt\n further determined that Congress did not intend to terminate the ex\n ception in 1948 when it \u201creplace[d] the law/equity distinction with\n the phrase \u2018all civil actions.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 700. The Ankenbrandt Court\n nevertheless emphasized that the exception covers only \u201ca narrow\n range of domestic relations issues.\u201d Id., at 701. Noting that some\n lower federal courts had applied the exception \u201cwell beyond the cir\n4                        MARSHALL v. MARSHALL\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    cumscribed situations posed by Barber and its progeny,\u201d ibid., the\n    Court clarified that only \u201cdivorce, alimony, and child custody decrees\u201d\n    remain outside federal jurisdictional bounds, id., at 703, 704. While\n    recognizing state tribunals\u2019 \u201cspecial proficiency\u201d in handling issues\n    arising in the granting of such decrees, id., at 704, the Court viewed\n    federal courts as equally equipped to deal with complaints alleging\n    torts, ibid. Pp. 8\u201311.\n        (b) This Court has recognized a probate exception, kin to the do\n    mestic relations exception, to otherwise proper federal jurisdiction.\n    See, e.g., Markham, the Court\u2019s most recent and pathmarking pro\n    nouncement on the subject. Among other things, the Markham Court\n    first stated that, although \u201ca federal court has no jurisdiction to pro\n    bate a will or administer an estate[,] it has [long] been established\n    . . . that federal courts of equity have jurisdiction to entertain suits \u2018in\n    favor of creditors, legatees and heirs\u2019 and other claimants against a\n    decedent\u2019s estate \u2018to establish their claims\u2019 so long as the federal\n    court does not interfere with the probate proceedings or assume gen\n    eral jurisdiction of the probate or control of the property in the cus\n    tody of the state court.\u201d 326 U. S., at 494. The Court next described a\n    probate exception of distinctly limited scope: \u201c[W]hile a federal court\n    may not exercise its jurisdiction to disturb or affect the possession of\n    property in the custody of a state court, . . . it may exercise its juris\n    diction to adjudicate rights in such property where the final judgment\n    does not undertake to interfere with the state court\u2019s possession save\n    to the extent that the state court is bound by the judgment to recog\n    nize the right adjudicated by the federal court.\u201d Ibid. The first of\n    these quoted passages is not a model of clear statement, and some\n    lower federal courts have read the words \u201cinterfere with the probate\n    proceedings\u201d to block federal jurisdiction over a range of matters well\n    beyond probate of a will or administration of a decedent\u2019s estate, in\n    cluding an executor\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty. This Court reads\n    Markham\u2019s enigmatic words, in sync with the second above-quoted\n    passage, to proscribe \u201cdisturb[ing] or affect[ing] the possession of\n    property in the custody of a state court.\u201d Ibid. Though that reading\n    renders the first-quoted passage in part redundant, redundancy in\n    this context is preferable to incoherence. This Court therefore com\n    prehends Markham\u2019s \u201cinterference\u201d language as essentially a reitera\n    tion of the general principle that, when one court is exercising in rem\n    jurisdiction over a res, a second court will not assume in rem jurisdic\n    tion over the same res. See, e.g., Penn General Casualty Co. v. Penn\n    sylvania ex rel. Schnader, 294 U. S. 189, 195\u2013196. Thus, the probate\n    exception reserves to state probate courts the probate or annulment\n    of a will and the administration of a decedent\u2019s estate; it also pre\n    cludes federal courts from disposing of property that is in the custody\n                    Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)                        5\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nof a state probate court. But it does not bar federal courts from adju\ndicating matters outside those confines and otherwise within federal\njurisdiction. Pp. 11\u201315.\n   (c) Vickie\u2019s claim does not involve the administration of an estate,\nthe probate of a will, or any other purely probate matter. Provoked\nby Pierce\u2019s claim in the bankruptcy proceedings, Vickie\u2019s claim al\nleges the widely recognized tort of interference with a gift or inheri\ntance. She seeks an in personam judgment against Pierce, not the\nprobate or annulment of a will. Cf. Sutton v. English, 246 U. S. 199,\n208. Nor does she seek to reach a res in a state court\u2019s custody. See\nMarkham, 326 U. S., at 494. Furthermore, no \u201csound policy consid\nerations\u201d militate in favor of extending the probate exception to cover\nthis case. Cf. Ankenbrandt, 504 U. S., at 703. Trial courts, both fed\neral and state, often address conduct of the kind Vickie alleges. State\nprobate courts possess no \u201cspecial proficiency\u201d in handling such is\nsues. Cf. id., at 704. P. 15.\n   (d) This Court rejects the Ninth Circuit\u2019s alternate rationale that\nthe Texas Probate Court\u2019s jurisdictional ruling bound the Federal\nDistrict Court. Texas courts have recognized a state-law tort action\nfor interference with an expected gift or inheritance. It is clear, un\nder Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, that Texas law governs the\nsubstantive elements of Vickie\u2019s tortious interference claim. But it is\nalso clear that Texas may not reserve to its probate courts the exclu\nsive right to adjudicate a transitory tort. See Tennessee Coal, Iron &\nR. Co. v. George, 233 U. S. 354, 360. Jurisdiction is determined \u201cby\nthe law of the court\u2019s creation and cannot be defeated by the extrater\nritorial operation of a [state] statute . . . , even though it created the\nright of action.\u201d Ibid. Directly on point, the Court has held that fed\neral-court jurisdiction, \u201chaving existed from the beginning of the Fed\neral government, [can] not be impaired by subsequent state legisla\ntion creating courts of probate.\u201d McClellan v. Carland, 217 U. S. 268,\n281. Durfee v. Duke, 375 U. S. 106, on which the Ninth Circuit relied,\nis not to the contrary. Durfee stands only for the proposition that a\nstate court\u2019s final judgment determining its own jurisdiction ordinar\nily qualifies for full faith and credit, so long as the jurisdictional issue\nwas fully and fairly litigated in the court that rendered the judgment.\nSee id., at 111, 115. At issue here, however, is not the Texas Probate\nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction, but the federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction to entertain\nVickie\u2019s tortious interference claim. Under our federal system, Texas\ncannot render its probate courts exclusively competent to entertain a\nclaim of that genre. Pp. 15\u201317.\n   (e) The Ninth Circuit may address on remand the questions\nwhether Vickie\u2019s claim was \u201ccore\u201d and Pierce\u2019s arguments concerning\nclaim and issue preclusion.

E. PIERCE\n                MARSHALL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                  [May 1, 2006]\n\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In Cohens v. Virginia, Chief Justice Marshall famously\ncautioned: \u201cIt is most true that this Court will not take\njurisdiction if it should not: but it is equally true, that it\nmust take jurisdiction, if it should . . . . We have no more\nright to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given,\nthan to usurp that which is not given.\u201d 6 Wheat. 264, 404\n(1821). Among longstanding limitations on federal juris\ndiction otherwise properly exercised are the so-called\n\u201cdomestic relations\u201d and \u201cprobate\u201d exceptions. Neither is\ncompelled by the text of the Constitution or federal stat\nute. Both are judicially created doctrines stemming in\nlarge measure from misty understandings of English legal\nhistory. See, e.g., Atwood, Domestic Relations Cases in\nFederal Court: Toward a Principled Exercise of Jurisdic\ntion, 35 Hastings L. J. 571, 584\u2013588 (1984); Spindel v.\nSpindel, 283 F. Supp. 797, 802 (EDNY 1968) (collecting\ncases and commentary revealing vulnerability of historical\nexplanation for domestic relations exception); Winkler,\nThe Probate Jurisdiction of the Federal Courts, 14 Probate\nL. J. 77, 125\u2013126, and n. 256 (1997) (describing historical\n2                 MARSHALL v. MARSHALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexplanation for probate exception as \u201can exercise in my\nthography\u201d). In the years following Marshall\u2019s 1821 pro\nnouncement, courts have sometimes lost sight of his ad\nmonition and have rendered decisions expansively\ninterpreting the two exceptions. In Ankenbrandt v. Rich\nards, 504 U. S. 689 (1992), this Court reined in the \u201cdo\nmestic relations exception.\u201d Earlier, in Markham v. Allen,\n326 U. S. 490 (1946), the Court endeavored similarly to\ncurtail the \u201cprobate exception.\u201d\n   Nevertheless, the Ninth Circuit in the instant case read\nthe probate exception broadly to exclude from the federal\ncourts\u2019 adjudicatory authority \u201cnot only direct challenges\nto a will or trust, but also questions which would ordinar\nily be decided by a probate court in determining the valid\nity of the decedent\u2019s estate planning instrument.\u201d 392\nF. 3d 1118, 1133 (2004). The Court of Appeals further\nheld that a State\u2019s vesting of exclusive jurisdiction over\nprobate matters in a special court strips federal courts of\njurisdiction to entertain any \u201cprobate related matter,\u201d\nincluding claims respecting \u201ctax liability, debt, gift, [or]\ntort.\u201d Id., at 1136. We hold that the Ninth Circuit had no\nwarrant from Congress, or from decisions of this Court, for\nits sweeping extension of the probate exception.\n                              I\n  Petitioner, Vickie Lynn Marshall (Vickie), also known as\nAnna Nicole Smith, is the surviving widow of J. Howard\nMarshall II (J. Howard). Vickie and J. Howard met in\nOctober 1991. After a courtship lasting more than two\nyears, they were married on June 27, 1994. J. Howard\ndied on August 4, 1995. Although he lavished gifts and\nsignificant sums of money on Vickie during their courtship\nand marriage, J. Howard did not include anything for\nVickie in his will. According to Vickie, J. Howard intended\nto provide for her financial security through a gift in the\nform of a \u201ccatch-all\u201d trust.\n                   Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   Respondent, E. Pierce Marshall (Pierce), one of J. How\nard\u2019s sons, was the ultimate beneficiary of J. Howard\u2019s\nestate plan, which consisted of a living trust and a\n\u201cpourover\u201d will. Under the terms of the will, all of J.\nHoward\u2019s assets not already included in the trust were to\nbe transferred to the trust upon his death.\n   Competing claims regarding J. Howard\u2019s fortune ignited\nproceedings in both state and federal courts. In January\n1996, while J. Howard\u2019s estate was subject to ongoing\nproceedings in Probate Court in Harris County, Texas,\nVickie filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bank\nruptcy Code, 11 U. S. C. \u00a71101 et seq., in the United States\nBankruptcy Court for the Central District of California.\nSee 275 B. R. 5, 8 (CD Cal. 2002). In June 1996, Pierce\nfiled a proof of claim in the federal bankruptcy proceeding,\nid., at 9; see 11 U. S. C. \u00a7501, alleging that Vickie had\ndefamed him when, shortly after J. Howard\u2019s death, law\nyers representing Vickie told members of the press that\nPierce had engaged in forgery, fraud, and overreaching to\ngain control of his father\u2019s assets. 275 B. R., at 9. Pierce\nsought a declaration that the debt he asserted in that\nclaim was not dischargeable in bankruptcy. Ibid.1 Vickie\nanswered, asserting truth as a defense. She also filed\ncounterclaims, among them a claim that Pierce had tor\ntiously interfered with a gift she expected. Ibid.; see App.\n23\u201325. Vickie alleged that Pierce prevented the transfer\nof his father\u2019s intended gift to her by, among other things:\neffectively imprisoning J. Howard against his wishes;\nsurrounding him with hired guards for the purpose of\npreventing personal contact between him and Vickie;\nmaking misrepresentations to J. Howard; and transferring\nproperty against J. Howard\u2019s expressed wishes. Id., at 24.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Among debts not dischargeable in bankruptcy, see 11 U. S. C.\n\n\u00a7523(a), are those arising from \u201cwillful and malicious injury by the\ndebtor,\u201d \u00a7523(a)(6).\n4                 MARSHALL v. MARSHALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Vickie\u2019s tortious interference counterclaim turned her\nobjection to Pierce\u2019s claim into an adversary proceeding.\nId., at 39; see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3007. In that pro\nceeding, the Bankruptcy Court granted summary judg\nment in favor of Vickie on Pierce\u2019s claim and, after a trial\non the merits, entered judgment for Vickie on her tortious\ninterference counterclaim. See 253 B. R. 550, 558\u2013559\n(2000). The Bankruptcy Court also held that both Vickie\u2019s\nobjection to Pierce\u2019s claim and Vickie\u2019s counterclaim quali\nfied as \u201ccore proceedings\u201d under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157, which\nmeant that the court had authority to enter a final judg\nment disposing of those claims. See 257 B. R. 35, 39\u201340\n(2000). The court awarded Vickie compensatory damages\nof more than $449 million\u2014less whatever she recovered in\nthe ongoing probate action in Texas\u2014as well as $25 mil\nlion in punitive damages. Id., at 40.\n   Pierce filed a post-trial motion to dismiss for lack of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction, asserting that Vickie\u2019s tortious\ninterference claim could be tried only in the Texas probate\nproceedings. Id., at 36. The Bankruptcy Court held that\n\u201cthe \u2018probate exception\u2019 argument was waived\u201d because it\nwas not timely raised. Id., at 39. Relying on this Court\u2019s\ndecision in Markham, the court observed that a federal\ncourt has jurisdiction to \u201cadjudicate rights in probate\nproperty, so long as its final judgment does not undertake\nto interfere with the state court\u2019s possession of the prop\nerty.\u201d 257 B. R., at 38 (citing Markham, 326 U. S., at 494).\n   Meanwhile, in the Texas Probate Court, Pierce sought a\ndeclaration that the living trust and his father\u2019s will were\nvalid. 392 F. 3d, at 1124\u20131125. Vickie, in turn, chal\nlenged the validity of the will and filed a tortious interfer\nence claim against Pierce, ibid., but voluntarily dismissed\nboth claims once the Bankruptcy Court entered its judg\nment, id., at 1128. Following a jury trial, the Probate\nCourt declared the living trust and J. Howard\u2019s will valid.\nId., at 1129.\n                     Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Back in the federal forum, Pierce sought district-court\nreview of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s judgment. While reject\ning the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s determination that Pierce had\nforfeited any argument based on the probate exception,\nthe District Court held that the exception did not reach\nVickie\u2019s claim. 264 B. R. 609, 619\u2013625 (CD Cal. 2001).\nThe Bankruptcy Court \u201cdid not assert jurisdiction gener\nally over the probate proceedings . . . or take control over\n[the] estate\u2019s assets,\u201d the District Court observed, id., at\n621, \u201c[t]hus, the probate exception would bar federal\njurisdiction over Vickie\u2019s counterclaim only if such juris\ndiction would \u2018interfere\u2019 with the probate proceedings,\u201d\nibid. (quoting Markham, 326 U. S., at 494). Federal juris\ndiction would not \u201cinterfere\u201d with the probate proceedings,\nthe District Court concluded, because: (1) success on\nVickie\u2019s counterclaim did not necessitate any declaration\nthat J. Howard\u2019s will was invalid, 264 B. R., at 621; and\n(2) under Texas law, probate courts do not have exclusive\njurisdiction to entertain claims of the kind asserted in\nVickie\u2019s counterclaim, id., at 622\u2013625.\n   The District Court also held that Vickie\u2019s claim did not\nqualify as a \u201ccore proceedin[g] arising under title 11, or\narising in a case under title 11.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157(b)(1); see\n264 B. R., at 625\u2013632. A bankruptcy court may exercise\nplenary power only over \u201ccore proceedings.\u201d See \u00a7157(b)\u2013\n(c).2 In non-core matters, a bankruptcy court may not\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 \u201cCore  proceedings include, but are not limited to\u2014\n   \u201c(A) matters concerning the administration of the estate;\n   \u201c(B) allowance or disallowance of claims against the estate or exemp\ntions from property of the estate, and estimation of claims or interests\nfor the purposes of confirming a plan under chapter 11, 12, or 13 of title\n11 but not the liquidation or estimation of contingent or unliquidated\npersonal injury tort or wrongful death claims against the estate for\npurposes of distribution in a case under title 11;\n   \u201c(C) counterclaims by the estate against persons filing claims against\nthe estate;\n   \u201c(D) orders in respect to obtaining credit;\n6                    MARSHALL v.

See \u00a7157(c)(1).\nAccordingly, the District Court treated the Bankruptcy\nCourt\u2019s judgment as \u201cproposed[,] rather than final,\u201d and\nundertook a \u201ccomprehensive, complete, and independent\nreview of\u201d the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s determinations. 264\nB. R., at 633.\n   Adopting and supplementing the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s\nfindings, the District Court determined that Pierce had\ntortiously interfered with Vickie\u2019s expectancy. Specifi\ncally, the District Court found that J. Howard directed his\nlawyers to prepare an inter vivos trust for Vickie consist\ning of half the appreciation of his assets from the date of\ntheir marriage. See 275 B. R., at 25\u201330, 51\u201353. It further\nfound that Pierce conspired to suppress or destroy the\ntrust instrument and to strip J. Howard of his assets by\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   \u201c(E) orders to turn over property of the estate;\n   \u201c(F) proceedings to determine, avoid, or recover preferences;\n   \u201c(G) motions to terminate, annul, or modify the automatic stay;\n   \u201c(H) proceedings to determine, avoid, or recover fraudulent convey\nances;\n   \u201c(I) determinations as to the dischargeability of particular debts;\n   \u201c(J) objections to discharges;\n   \u201c(K) determinations of the validity, extent, or priority of liens;\n   \u201c(L) confirmations of plans;\n   \u201c(M) orders approving the use or lease of property, including the use\nof cash collateral;\n   \u201c(N) orders approving the sale of property other than property result\ning from claims brought by the estate against persons who have not\nfiled claims against the estate;\n   \u201c(O) other proceedings affecting the liquidation of the assets of the\nestate or the adjustment of the debtor-creditor or the equity security\nholder relationship, except personal injury tort or wrongful death\nclaims; and\n   \u201c(P) recognition of foreign proceedings and other matters under chap\nter 15 of title 11.\u201d 28 U.

Based on these findings, the District Court\nawarded Vickie some $44.3 million in compensatory dam\nages. 275 B. R., at 53\u201357. In addition, finding \u201cover\nwhelming\u201d evidence of Pierce\u2019s \u201cwillfulness, maliciousness,\nand fraud,\u201d the District Court awarded an equal amount\nin punitive damages. Id., at 57\u201358.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.\nThe appeals court recognized that Vickie\u2019s claim \u201cdoes not\ninvolve the administration of an estate, the probate of a\nwill, or any other purely probate matter.\u201d 392 F. 3d, at\n1133. Nevertheless, the court held that the probate excep\ntion bars federal jurisdiction in this case. In the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s view, a claim falls within the probate exception if\nit raises \u201cquestions which would ordinarily be decided by a\nprobate court in determining the validity of the decedent\u2019s\nestate planning instrument,\u201d whether those questions\ninvolve \u201cfraud, undue influence[, or] tortious interference\nwith the testator\u2019s intent.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Ninth Circuit was also of the view that state-court\ndelineation of a probate court\u2019s exclusive adjudicatory\nauthority could control federal subject-matter jurisdiction.\nIn this regard, the Court of Appeals stated: \u201cWhere a state\nhas relegated jurisdiction over probate matters to a special\ncourt and [the] state\u2019s trial courts of general jurisdiction\ndo not have jurisdiction to hear probate matters, then\nfederal courts also lack jurisdiction over probate matters.\u201d\nId., at 1136. Noting that \u201c[t]he [P]robate [C]ourt ruled it\nhad exclusive jurisdiction over all of Vickie[\u2019s] claims,\u201d the\nNinth Circuit held that \u201cruling . . . binding on the United\nStates [D]istrict [C]ourt.\u201d Ibid.

S. ___ (2005), to resolve\nthe apparent confusion among federal courts concerning\nthe scope of the probate exception. Satisfied that the\ninstant case does not fall within the ambit of the narrow\nexception recognized by our decisions, we reverse the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s judgment.\n                              II\n   In Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U. S. 689 (1992), we\naddressed both the derivation and the limits of the \u201cdo\nmestic relations exception\u201d to the exercise of federal juris\ndiction. Carol Ankenbrandt, a citizen of Missouri, brought\nsuit in Federal District Court on behalf of her daughters,\nnaming as defendants their father (Ankenbrandt\u2019s former\nhusband) and his female companion, both citizens of Lou\nisiana. Id., at 691. Ankenbrandt\u2019s complaint sought\ndamages for the defendants\u2019 alleged sexual and physical\nabuse of the children. Ibid. Federal jurisdiction was\npredicated on diversity of citizenship. Ibid. (citing 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71332). The District Court dismissed the case for\nlack of subject-matter jurisdiction, holding that Anken\nbrandt\u2019s suit fell within \u201cthe \u2018domestic relations\u2019 exception\nto diversity jurisdiction.\u201d 504 U. S., at 692. The Court of\nAppeals agreed and affirmed. Ibid. We reversed the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 judgment. Id., at 706\u2013707.\n   Holding that the District Court improperly refrained\nfrom exercising jurisdiction over Ankenbrandt\u2019s tort claim,\nid., at 704, we traced explanation of the current domestic\nrelations exception to Barber v. Barber, 21 How. 582\n(1859). See Ankenbrandt, 504 U. S., at 693\u2013695. In Bar\nber, the Court upheld federal-court authority, in a diver\nsity case, to enforce an alimony award decreed by a state\ncourt. In dicta, however, the Barber Court announced\u2014\nwithout citation or discussion\u2014that federal courts lack\njurisdiction over suits for divorce or the allowance of ali\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006) \t           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmony. 21 How., at 584\u2013589; see Ankenbrandt, 504 U. S.,\nat 693\u2013695.\n  Finding no Article III impediment to federal-court juris\ndiction in domestic relations cases, id., at 695\u2013697, the\nCourt in Ankenbrandt anchored the exception in Congress\u2019\noriginal provision for diversity jurisdiction, id., at 698\u2013\n701. \tBeginning at the beginning, the Court recalled:\n       \u201cThe Judiciary Act of 1789 provided that \u2018the circuit\n    courts shall have original cognizance, concurrent with\n    the courts of the several States, of all suits of a civil\n    nature at common law or in equity, where the matter\n    in dispute exceeds, exclusive of costs, the sum or value\n    of five hundred dollars, and . . . an alien is a party, or\n    the suit is between a citizen of the State where the suit\n    is brought, and a citizen of another State.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 698\n    (quoting Act of Sept. 24, 1789, \u00a711, 1 Stat. 78; empha\n    sis added in Ankenbrandt).\nThe defining phrase, \u201call suits of a civil nature at common\nlaw or in equity,\u201d the Court stressed, remained in succes\nsive statutory provisions for diversity jurisdiction until\n1948, when Congress adopted the more economical phrase,\n\u201call civil actions.\u201d 504 U. S., at 698; 1948 Judicial Code\nand Judiciary Act, 62 Stat. 930, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332.\n   The Barber majority, we acknowledged in Ankenbrandt,\ndid not expressly tie its announcement of a domestic rela\ntions exception to the text of the diversity statute. 504\nU. S., at 698. But the dissenters in that case made the\nconnection. They stated that English courts of chancery\nlacked authority to issue divorce and alimony decrees.\nBecause \u201cthe jurisdiction of the courts of the United States\nin chancery is bounded by that of the chancery in Eng\nland,\u201d Barber, 21 How., at 605 (opinion of Daniel, J.), the\ndissenters reasoned, our federal courts similarly lack\nauthority to decree divorces or award alimony, ibid. Such\nrelief, in other words, would not fall within the diversity\n10                MARSHALL v. MARSHALL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute\u2019s original grant of jurisdiction over \u201call suits of a\ncivil nature at common law or in equity.\u201d We concluded in\nAnkenbrandt that \u201cit may be inferred fairly that the juris\ndictional limitation recognized by the [Barber] Court\nrested on th[e] statutory basis\u201d indicated by the dissenters\nin that case. 504 U. S., at 699.\n   We were \u201ccontent\u201d in Ankenbrandt \u201cto rest our conclu\nsion that a domestic relations exception exists as a matter\nof statutory construction not on the accuracy of the his\ntorical justifications on which [the exception] was seem\ningly based.\u201d Id., at 700. \u201c[R]ather,\u201d we relied on \u201cCon\ngress\u2019 apparent acceptance of this construction of the\ndiversity jurisdiction provisions in the years prior to 1948,\nwhen the statute limited jurisdiction to \u2018suits of a civil\nnature at common law or in equity.\u2019\u201d Ibid. (quoting 1 Stat.\n78). We further determined that Congress did not intend\nto terminate the exception in 1948 when it \u201creplace[d] the\nlaw/equity distinction with the phrase \u2018all civil actions.\u2019 \u201d\n504 U. S., at 700. Absent contrary indications, we pre\nsumed that Congress meant to leave undisturbed \u201cthe\nCourt\u2019s nearly century-long interpretation\u201d of the diversity\nstatute \u201cto contain an exception for certain domestic rela\ntions matters.\u201d Ibid.\n   We nevertheless emphasized in Ankenbrandt that the\nexception covers only \u201ca narrow range of domestic rela\ntions issues.\u201d Id., at 701. The Barber Court itself, we\nreminded, \u201csanctioned the exercise of federal jurisdiction\nover the enforcement of an alimony decree that had been\nproperly obtained in a state court of competent jurisdic\ntion.\u201d 504 U. S., at 702. Noting that some lower federal\ncourts had applied the domestic relations exception \u201cwell\nbeyond the circumscribed situations posed by Barber and\nits progeny,\u201d id., at 701, we clarified that only \u201cdivorce,\nalimony, and child custody decrees\u201d remain outside federal\njurisdictional bounds, id., at 703, 704. While recognizing\nthe \u201cspecial proficiency developed by state tribunals . . . in\n                     Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhandling issues that arise in the granting of [divorce,\nalimony, and child custody] decrees,\u201d id., at 704, we\nviewed federal courts as equally equipped to deal with\ncomplaints alleging the commission of torts, ibid.\n                             III\n    Federal jurisdiction in this case is premised on 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71334, the statute vesting in federal district\ncourts jurisdiction in bankruptcy cases and related pro\nceedings. Decisions of this Court have recognized a \u201cpro\nbate exception,\u201d kin to the domestic relations exception, to\notherwise proper federal jurisdiction. See Markham v.\nAllen, 326 U. S., at 494; see also Sutton v. English, 246\nU. S. 199 (1918); Waterman v. Canal-Louisiana Bank &\nTrust Co., 215 U. S. 33 (1909). Like the domestic relations\nexception, the probate exception has been linked to lan\nguage contained in the Judiciary Act of 1789.\n    Markham, the Court\u2019s most recent and pathmarking\npronouncement on the probate exception, stated that \u201cthe\nequity jurisdiction conferred by the Judiciary Act of 1789\n. . . , which is that of the English Court of Chancery in\n1789, did not extend to probate matters.\u201d 326 U. S., at\n494. See generally Nicolas, Fighting the Probate Mafia: A\nDissection of the Probate Exception to Federal Jurisdic\ntion, 74 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1479 (2001). As in Ankenbrandt, so\nin this case, \u201c[w]e have no occasion . . . to join the histori\ncal debate\u201d over the scope of English chancery jurisdiction\nin 1789, 504 U. S., at 699, for Vickie Marshall\u2019s claim falls\nfar outside the bounds of the probate exception described\nin Markham. We therefore need not consider in this case\nwhether there exists any uncodified probate exception to\nfederal bankruptcy jurisdiction under \u00a71334.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 We note that the broad grant of jurisdiction conferred by \u00a71334(b) is\nsubject to a mandatory abstention provision applicable to certain state-\nlaw claims. Section 1334(c)(2) provides:\n12                    MARSHALL v. MARSHALL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  In Markham, the plaintiff Alien Property Custodian4\ncommenced suit in Federal District Court against an\nexecutor and resident heirs to determine the Custodian\u2019s\nasserted rights regarding a decedent\u2019s estate. 326 U. S., at\n491\u2013492. Jurisdiction was predicated on \u00a724(1) of the\nJudicial Code, now 28 U. S. C. \u00a71345, which provides for\nfederal jurisdiction over suits brought by an officer of the\nUnited States. At the time the federal suit commenced,\nthe estate was undergoing probate administration in a\nstate court. The Custodian had issued an order vesting in\nhimself all right, title, and interest of German legatees.\nHe sought and gained in the District Court a judgment\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  \u201cUpon timely motion of a party in a proceeding based upon a State\nlaw claim or State law cause of action, related to a case under title 11\nbut not arising under title 11 or arising in a case under title 11, with\nrespect to which an action could not have been commenced in a court of\nthe United States absent jurisdiction under this section, the district\ncourt shall abstain from hearing such proceeding if an action is com\nmenced, and can be timely adjudicated, in a State forum of appropriate\njurisdiction.\u201d\nThat provision is, in turn, qualified: \u201cNon-core proceedings under\nsection 157(b)(2)(B) of title 28, United States Code, shall not be subject\nto the mandatory abstention provisions of section 1334(c)(2).\u201d\n\u00a7157(b)(4). Because the Bankruptcy Court rejected Pierce\u2019s motion for\nmandatory abstention as untimely, 257 B. R. 35, 39 (CD Cal. 2000), we\nneed not consider whether these provisions might have required ab\nstention upon a timely motion.\n  4 Section 6 of the Trading with the Enemy Act, 40 Stat. 415, 50\n\nU. S. C. App., authorizes the President to appoint an official known as\nthe \u201calien property custodian,\u201d who is responsible for \u201creceiv[ing,] . . .\nhold[ing], administer[ing], and account[ing] for\u201d \u201call money and prop\nerty in the United States due or belonging to an enemy, or ally of\nenemy . . . .\u201d The Act was originally enacted during World War I \u201cto\npermit, under careful safeguards and restrictions, certain kinds of\nbusiness to be carried on\u201d among warring nations, and to \u201cprovid[e] for\nthe care and administration of the property and property rights of\nenemies and their allies in this country pending the war.\u201d Markham v.\nCabell, 326 U. S. 404, 414, n. 1 (1945) (Burton, J., concurring) (quoting\nS. Rep. No. 113, 65th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1 (1917)).\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)            13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndetermining that the resident heirs had no interest in the\nestate, and that the Custodian, substituting himself for\nthe German legatees, was entitled to the entire net estate,\nincluding specified real estate passing under the will.\n  Reversing the Ninth Circuit, which had ordered the case\ndismissed for want of federal subject-matter jurisdiction,\nthis Court held that federal jurisdiction was properly\ninvoked. The Court first stated:\n        \u201cIt is true that a federal court has no jurisdiction\n    to probate a will or administer an estate . . . . But it\n    has been established by a long series of decisions of\n    this Court that federal courts of equity have jurisdic\n    tion to entertain suits \u2018in favor of creditors, legatees\n    and heirs\u2019 and other claimants against a decedent\u2019s\n    estate \u2018to establish their claims\u2019 so long as the federal\n    court does not interfere with the probate proceedings\n    or assume general jurisdiction of the probate or con\n    trol of the property in the custody of the state court.\u201d\n    326 U. S., at 494 (quoting Waterman, 215 U. S., at 43).\nNext, the Court described a probate exception of distinctly\nlimited scope:\n    \u201c[W]hile a federal court may not exercise its jurisdic\n    tion to disturb or affect the possession of property in\n    the custody of a state court, . . . it may exercise its ju\n    risdiction to adjudicate rights in such property where\n    the final judgment does not undertake to interfere\n    with the state court\u2019s possession save to the extent\n    that the state court is bound by the judgment to rec\n    ognize the right adjudicated by the federal court.\u201d 326\n    U. S., at 494.\n  The first of the above-quoted passages from Markham is\nnot a model of clear statement. The Court observed that\nfederal courts have jurisdiction to entertain suits to de\ntermine the rights of creditors, legatees, heirs, and other\n14                MARSHALL v. MARSHALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nclaimants against a decedent\u2019s estate, \u201cso long as the\nfederal court does not interfere with the probate proceed\nings.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added). Lower federal courts have\npuzzled over the meaning of the words \u201cinterfere with the\nprobate proceedings,\u201d and some have read those words to\nblock federal jurisdiction over a range of matters well\nbeyond probate of a will or administration of a decedent\u2019s\nestate. See, e.g., Mangieri v. Mangieri, 226 F. 3d 1, 2\u20133\n(CA1 2000) (breach of fiduciary duty by executor); Golden\nex rel. Golden v. Golden, 382 F. 3d 348, 360\u2013362 (CA3\n2004) (same); Lepard v. NBD Bank, 384 F. 3d 232\u2013237\n(CA6 2004) (breach of fiduciary duty by trustee); Storm v.\nStorm, 328 F. 3d 941, 943\u2013945 (CA7 2003) (probate excep\ntion bars claim that plaintiff\u2019s father tortiously interfered\nwith plaintiff\u2019s inheritance by persuading trust grantor to\namend irrevocable inter vivos trust); Rienhardt v. Kelly,\n164 F. 3d 1296, 1300\u20131301 (CA10 1999) (probate exception\nbars claim that defendants exerted undue influence on\ntestator and thereby tortiously interfered with plaintiff\u2019s\nexpected inheritance).\n   We read Markham\u2019s enigmatic words, in sync with the\nsecond above-quoted passage, to proscribe \u201cdisturb[ing] or\naffect[ing] the possession of property in the custody of a\nstate court.\u201d 326 U. S., at 494. True, that reading renders\nthe first-quoted passage in part redundant, but redun\ndancy in this context, we do not doubt, is preferable to\nincoherence. In short, we comprehend the \u201cinterference\u201d\nlanguage in Markham as essentially a reiteration of the\ngeneral principle that, when one court is exercising in rem\njurisdiction over a res, a second court will not assume in\nrem jurisdiction over the same res. See, e.g., Penn General\nCasualty Co. v. Pennsylvania ex rel. Schnader, 294 U. S.\n189, 195\u2013196 (1935); Waterman, 215 U. S., at 45\u201346.\nThus, the probate exception reserves to state probate\ncourts the probate or annulment of a will and the admini\nstration of a decedent\u2019s estate; it also precludes federal\n                   Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)             15\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\ncourts from endeavoring to dispose of property that is in\nthe custody of a state probate court. But it does not bar\nfederal courts from adjudicating matters outside those\nconfines and otherwise within federal jurisdiction.\n                                A\n  As the Court of Appeals correctly observed, Vickie\u2019s\nclaim does not \u201cinvolve the administration of an estate,\nthe probate of a will, or any other purely probate matter.\u201d\n392 F. 3d, at 1133. Provoked by Pierce\u2019s claim in the\nbankruptcy proceedings, Vickie\u2019s claim, like Carol Anken\nbrandt\u2019s, alleges a widely recognized tort. See King v.\nAcker, 725 S. W. 2d 750, 754 (Tex. App. 1987); Restate\nment (Second) of Torts \u00a7774B (1977) (\u201cOne who by fraud,\nduress or other tortious means intentionally prevents\nanother from receiving from a third person an inheritance\nor gift that [s]he would otherwise have received is subject\nto liability to the other for loss of the inheritance or gift.\u201d).\nVickie seeks an in personam judgment against Pierce, not\nthe probate or annulment of a will. Cf. Sutton, 246 U. S.,\nat 208 (suit to annul a will found \u201csupplemental to the\nproceedings for probate of the will\u201d and therefore not\ncognizable in federal court). Nor does she seek to reach a\nres in the custody of a state court. See Markham, 326\nU. S., at 494.\n  Furthermore, no \u201csound policy considerations\u201d militate\nin favor of extending the probate exception to cover the\ncase at hand. Cf. Ankenbrandt, 504 U. S., at 703. Trial\ncourts, both federal and state, often address conduct of the\nkind Vickie alleges. State probate courts possess no \u201cspe\ncial proficiency . . . in handling [such] issues.\u201d Cf. id., at\n704.\n                           B\n  The Court of Appeals advanced an alternate basis for its\nconclusion that the federal courts lack jurisdiction over\n16                   MARSHALL v.

We reject that\ndetermination.\n  Texas courts have recognized a state-law tort action for\ninterference with an expected inheritance or gift, modeled\non the Restatement formulation. See King, 725 S. W. 2d,\nat 754; Brandes v. Rice Trust, Inc., 966 S. W. 2d 144, 146\u2013\n147 (Tex. App. 1998).5 It is clear, under Erie R. Co. v.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 Texas appellate courts have on occasion held claims of tortious in\n\nterference with an expected inheritance \u201cbarred\u201d by a prior probate\ncourt judgment, apparently applying ordinary principles of preclusion.\nSee, e.g., Thompson v. Deloitte & Touche, 902 S. W. 2d 13, 16 (Tex. App.\n1995) (final probate court judgment bars claim of tortious interference\nwith inheritance expectancy because probate court \u201cnecessarily found\nthat [the decedent] signed the will with testamentary capacity, and\nthat it reflected his intent, was not the result of coercion or undue\ninfluence, and was valid\u201d); Neill v. Yett, 746 S. W. 2d 32, 35\u201336 (Tex.\nApp. 1988) (complaint alleging fraud and tortious interference with\ninheritance expectancy, filed more than two years after will was admit\nted to probate, was barred by both the statute of limitations and the\nfinal probate judgment, and failed to state the elements of the claim).\nNeither Thompson nor Neill questions the Texas trial courts\u2019 subject-\nmatter jurisdiction over the claims in question.\n   Pierce maintains that Thompson, Neill, and other Texas decisions\nsupport his contention that preclusion principles bar Vickie\u2019s claim.\nSee Brief for Respondent 36\u201338. Vickie argues to the contrary. See\nBrief for Petitioner 42 n. 30 (urging that preclusion does not apply\nbecause (1) Vickie\u2019s claim was not litigated to final judgment in the\nTexas probate proceedings; (2) having presented her claim in the\nBankruptcy Court years before she joined the Texas will contest, Vickie\nwas not obliged to present her claim in the Texas proceedings; (3) the\nBankruptcy Court\u2019s judgment preceded the Probate Court judgment;\nand (4) the Texas Probate Court did not have before it important\nevidence).

Co. v. George, 233 U. S. 354, 360 (1914). Juris\ndiction is determined \u201cby the law of the court\u2019s creation\nand cannot be defeated by the extraterritorial operation of\na [state] statute . . . , even though it created the right of\naction.\u201d Ibid. Directly on point, we have held that the\njurisdiction of the federal courts, \u201chaving existed from the\nbeginning of the Federal government, [can] not be im\npaired by subsequent state legislation creating courts of\nprobate.\u201d McClellan v. Carland, 217 U. S. 268, 281 (1910)\n(upholding federal jurisdiction over action by heirs of\ndecedent, who died intestate, to determine their rights in\nthe estate (citing Waterman, 215 U. S. 33)).\n  Our decision in Durfee v. Duke, 375 U. S. 106 (1963),\nrelied upon by the Ninth Circuit, 392 F. 3d, at 1136, is not\nto the contrary. Durfee stands only for the proposition\nthat a state court\u2019s final judgment determining its own\njurisdiction ordinarily qualifies for full faith and credit, so\nlong as the jurisdictional issue was fully and fairly liti\ngated in the court that rendered the judgment. See 375\nU. S., at 111, 115. At issue here, however, is not the Texas\nProbate Court\u2019s jurisdiction, but the federal courts\u2019 juris\ndiction to entertain Vickie\u2019s tortious interference claim.\nUnder our federal system, Texas cannot render its probate\ncourts exclusively competent to entertain a claim of that\ngenre. We therefore hold that the District Court properly\n18                MARSHALL v.

PIERCE\n                MARSHALL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                         [May 1, 2006]\n\n\n   JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and concurring in\nthe judgment.\n   The administration of decedents\u2019 estates typically is\ngoverned by rules of state law and conducted by state\nprobate courts. Occasionally, however, disputes between\ninterested parties arise, either in the probate proceeding\nitself or elsewhere, that qualify as cases or controversies\nthat federal courts have jurisdiction to decide. See, e.g.,\nReed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71 (1971). In her opinion for the\nCourt, JUSTICE GINSBURG has cogently explained why this\nis such a case. I write separately to explain why I do not\nbelieve there is any \u201cprobate exception\u201d that ousts a federal\ncourt of jurisdiction it otherwise possesses.\n   The familiar aphorism that hard cases make bad law\nshould extend to easy cases as well. Markham v. Allen,\n326 U. S. 490 (1946), like this case, was an easy case. In\nMarkham, as here, it was unnecessary to question the\nhistorical or logical underpinnings of the probate exception\nto federal jurisdiction because, whatever the scope of the\nsupposed exception, it did not extend to the case at hand.\nBut Markham\u2019s obiter dicta\u2014dicta that the Court now\ndescribes as redundant if not incoherent, ante, at 14\u2014\ngenerated both confusion and abdication of the obligation\nChief Justice Marshall so famously articulated, see\nCohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821); see also\n2                     MARSHALL v. MARSHALL\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nante, at 1. While the Court today rightly abandons much\nof that dicta, I would go further.\n   The Court is content to adopt the approach it followed in\nAnkenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U. S. 689 (1992), and to\naccept as foundation for the probate exception Markham\u2019s\nbald assertion that the English High Court of Chancery\u2019s\njurisdiction did not \u201cextend to probate matters\u201d in 1789.\n326 U. S., at 495; see ante, at 11. I would not accept that\npremise. Not only had the theory Markham espoused\nbeen only sporadically and tentatively cited as justification\nfor the exception,1 but the most comprehensive article on\nthe subject has persuasively demonstrated that Mark\nham\u2019s assertion is \u201can exercise in mythography.\u201d2\n   Markham\u2019s theory apparently is the source of the\nCourt\u2019s reformulated exception, which \u201creserves to state\nprobate courts the probate or annulment of a will and the\nadministration of a decedent\u2019s estate.\u201d Ante, at 14. Al\nthough undoubtedly narrower in scope than Markham\u2019s\nill-considered description of the probate carve-out, this\ndescription also sweeps too broadly. For the Court has\ncorrectly upheld the exercise of federal jurisdiction over\nactions involving the annulment of wills and the admini\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Notably, Justice Joseph Bradley, a strong proponent of the theory\n\nthat federal courts sitting in equity cannot exercise jurisdiction over\nprobate matters because in England in 1789 such jurisdiction belonged\nto the ecclesiastical courts, see Case of Broderick\u2019s Will, 21 Wall. 503\n(1875), Gaines v. Fuentes, 92 U. S. 10, 24-25 (1876) (dissenting opinion),\nurged that \u201ceven in matters savoring of [e]cclesiastical process, after an\nissue has been formed between definite parties,\u201d the controversy should be\nheard by a federal court. See Rosenbaum v. Bauer, 120 U. S. 450, 460-461\n(1887) (dissenting opinion) (citing Gaines, 92 U. S., at 17, and Hess v.\nReynolds, 113 U. S. 73 (1885)).\n   2 Winkler, The Probate Jurisdiction of the Federal Courts, 14 Probate\n\nL. J. 77, 126 (1997); see ante, at 1\u20132 (acknowledging Winkler\u2019s analy\nsis). Winkler also observes, citing Charles Dickens\u2019 Bleak House\n(1853), that Markham\u2019s \u201csuggestion that the High Court of Chancery\nhad lacked jurisdiction to \u2018administer an estate\u2019 was preposterous.\u201d 14\nProbate L. J., at 125, and n. 256.\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)            3\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nstration of decedents\u2019 estates. In Gaines v. Fuentes, 92\nU. S. 10 (1876), for example, the Court held that a defen\ndant in an action to annul a will should be permitted to\nremove the case to federal court. In so doing, it explained:\n    \u201c[W]henever a controversy in a suit . . . arises respect\n    ing the validity or construction of a will, or the en\n    forcement of a decree admitting it to probate, there is\n    no more reason why the Federal courts should not\n    take jurisdiction of the case than there is that they\n    should not take jurisdiction of any other controversy\n    between the parties.\u201d Id., at 22.\nLikewise, in Payne v. Hook, 7 Wall. 425 (1869), the Court\nexplained that it was \u201cwell settled that a court of chan\ncery, as an incident to its power to enforce trusts, and\nmake those holding a fiduciary relation account, has juris\ndiction to compel executors and administrators to account\nand distribute the assets in their hands.\u201d Id., at 431. (In\nthat same case, a federal court later appointed a Special\nMaster to administer the estate. This Court upheld some\nof the Master\u2019s determinations and rejected others. See\nHook v. Payne, 14 Wall. 252, 255 (1872).)\n   To be sure, there are cases that support limitations on\nfederal courts\u2019 jurisdiction over the probate and annul\nment of wills and the administration of decedents\u2019 estates.\nBut careful examination reveals that at least most of the\nlimitations so recognized stem not from some sui generis\nexception, but rather from generally applicable jurisdic\ntional rules. Cf. Ellis v. Davis, 109 U. S. 485, 497 (1883)\n(\u201cJurisdiction as to wills, and their probate as such, is\nneither included in nor excepted out of the grant of judicial\npower to the courts of the United States\u201d). Some of those\nrules, like the rule that diversity jurisdiction will not\nattach absent an inter partes controversy, plainly are still\nrelevant today. See, e.g., Waterman v. Canal-Louisiana\nBank & Trust Co., 215 U. S. 33, 44\u201345 (1909); see also id.,\n4                 MARSHALL v. MARSHALL\n\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nat 46 (reaffirming the in gremio legis principle). Others,\nlike the rule that a bill in equity will lie only where there\nis no adequate remedy elsewhere, have less straightfor\nward application in the wake of 20th-century jurisdic\ntional developments. See, e.g., Case of Broderick\u2019s Will, 21\nWall. 503, 510\u2013512 (1875); Ellis, 109 U. S., at 503 (deny\ning relief where plaintiff had \u201ca plain, adequate, and\ncomplete remedy at law\u201d); see also Winkler, supra, n.2, at\n112\u2013113. Whatever the continuing viability of these indi\nvidual rules, together they are more than adequate to the\ntask of cabining federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction. They require\nno helping hand from the so-called probate exception.\n   Rather than preserving whatever vitality that the \u201cex\nception\u201d has retained as a result of the Markham dicta, I\nwould provide the creature with a decent burial in a grave\nadjacent to the resting place of the Rooker-Feldman doc\ntrine. See Lance v. Dennis, 546 U. S. ___, ___ (2006)\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2\u20133).\n",

Among longstanding limitations on federal jurisdiction otherwise properly exercised are the so-called \"domestic relations\" and \"probate\" exceptions. Neither is compelled by the text of the Constitution or federal statute. Both are judicially created doctrines stemming in large measure from misty understandings of English legal history. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Atwood, Domestic Relations Cases in Federal Court: Toward a Principled Exercise of Jurisdiction, 35 Hastings L. J. 571, 584-588 (1984); <i>Spindel</i> v. <i>Spindel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1906075\"><a href=\"/opinion/1906075/spindel-v-spindel/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

J. 77, 125-126, and n. 256 (1997) (describing historical explanation for probate exception as \"an exercise in mythography\"). In the years following Marshall's 1821 pronouncement, courts have sometimes lost sight of his admonition and have rendered decisions expansively interpreting the two exceptions. In <i>Ankenbrandt</i> v. <i>Richards,</i> 504 U. S. 689 (1992), this Court reined in the \"domestic relations exception.\" Earlier, in <i>Markham</i> v. <i>Allen,</i> 326 U. S. 490 (1946), the Court endeavored similarly to curtail the \"probate exception.\"</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Ninth Circuit in the instant case read the probate exception broadly to exclude from the federal courts' adjudicatory authority \"not only direct challenges to a will or trust, but also questions which would ordinarily be decided by a probate court in determining the validity of the decedent's estate planning instrument.\" 392 F. 3d 1118, 1133 (2004). The Court of Appeals further held that a State's vesting of exclusive jurisdiction over probate matters in a special court strips federal courts of jurisdiction to entertain any \"probate related matter,\" including claims respecting \"tax liability, debt, gift, [or] tort.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1136. We hold that the Ninth Circuit had no warrant from Congress, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*300</span> or from decisions of this Court, for its sweeping extension of the probate exception.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner, Vickie Lynn Marshall (Vickie), also known as Anna Nicole Smith, is the surviving widow of J. Howard Marshall II (J. Howard). Vickie and J. Howard met in October 1991. After a courtship lasting more than two years, they were married on June 27, 1994. J. Howard died on August 4, 1995. Although he lavished gifts and significant sums of money on Vickie during their courtship and marriage, J. Howard did not include anything for Vickie in his will. According to Vickie, J. Howard intended to provide for her financial security through a gift in the form of a \"catchall\" trust.</p>\n<p>Respondent, E. Pierce Marshall (Pierce), one of J. Howard's sons, was the ultimate beneficiary of J. Howard's estate plan, which consisted of a living trust and a \"pourover\" will. Under the terms of the will, all of J. Howard's assets not already included in the trust were to be transferred to the trust upon his death.</p>\n<p>Competing claims regarding J. Howard's fortune ignited proceedings in both state and federal courts. In January 1996, while J. Howard's estate was subject to ongoing proceedings in Probate Court in Harris County, Texas, Vickie filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101 <i>et seq.,</i> in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California. See 275 B. R. 5, 8 (CD Cal. 2002). In June 1996, Pierce filed a proof of claim in the federal bankruptcy proceeding, <i>id.,</i> at 9; see 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 501, alleging that Vickie had defamed him when, shortly after J. Howard's death, lawyers representing Vickie told members of the press that Pierce had engaged in forgery, fraud, and overreaching to gain control of his father's assets, 275 B. R., at 9. Pierce sought a declaration that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*301</span> the debt he asserted in that claim was not dischargeable in bankruptcy. <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[1]</sup> Vickie answered, asserting truth as a defense. She also filed counterclaims, among them a claim that Pierce had tortiously interfered with a gift she expected. <i>Ibid.;</i> see App. 23-25. Vickie alleged that Pierce prevented the transfer of his father's intended gift to her by, among other things: effectively imprisoning J. Howard against his wishes; surrounding him with hired guards for the purpose of preventing personal contact between him and Vickie; making misrepresentations to J. Howard; and transferring property against J. Howard's expressed wishes. <i>Id.,</i> at 24.</p>\n<p>Vickie's tortious interference counterclaim turned her objection to Pierce's claim into an adversary proceeding. <i>Id.,</i> at 39; see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3007. In that proceeding, the Bankruptcy Court granted summary judgment in favor of Vickie on Pierce's claim and, after a trial on the merits, entered judgment for Vickie on her tortious interference counterclaim. See 253 B. R. 550, 558-559 (2000). The Bankruptcy Court also held that both Vickie's objection to Pierce's claim and Vickie's counterclaim qualified as \"core proceedings\" under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 157, which meant that the court had authority to enter a final judgment disposing of those claims. See 257 B. R. 35, 39-40 (2000). The court awarded Vickie compensatory damages of more than $449 million\u0097less whatever she recovered in the ongoing probate action in Texas\u0097as well as $25 million in punitive damages. <i>Id.,</i> at 40.</p>\n<p>Pierce filed a post-trial motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, asserting that Vickie's tortious interference claim could be tried only in the Texas probate proceedings. <i>Id.,</i> at 36. The Bankruptcy Court held that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*302</span> \"the `probate exception' argument was waived\" because it was not timely raised. <i>Id.,</i> at 39. Relying on this Court's decision in <i>Markham,</i> the court observed that a federal court has jurisdiction to \"adjudicate rights in probate property, so long as its final judgment does not undertake to interfere with the state court's possession of the property.\" 257 B. R., at 38 (citing <i>Markham,</i> 326 U. S., at 494).</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in the Texas Probate Court, Pierce sought a declaration that the living trust and his father's will were valid. 392 F. 3d, at 1124-1125. Vickie, in turn, challenged the validity of the will and filed a tortious interference claim against Pierce, <i>ibid.,</i> but voluntarily dismissed both claims once the Bankruptcy Court entered its judgment, <i>id.,</i> at 1128. Following a jury trial, the Probate Court declared the living trust and J. Howard's will valid. <i>Id.,</i> at 1129.</p>\n<p>Back in the federal forum, Pierce sought district-court review of the Bankruptcy Court's judgment. While rejecting the Bankruptcy Court's determination that Pierce had forfeited any argument based on the probate exception, the District Court held that the exception did not reach Vickie's claim. 264 B. R. 609, 619-625 (CD Cal. 2001). The Bankruptcy Court \"did not assert jurisdiction generally over the probate proceedings . . . or take control over [the] estate's assets,\" the District Court observed, <i>id.,</i> at 621, \"[t]hus, the probate exception would bar federal jurisdiction over Vickie's counterclaim only if such jurisdiction would `interfere' with the probate proceedings,\" <i>ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Markham,</i> 326 U. S., at 494). Federal jurisdiction would not \"interfere\" with the probate proceedings, the District Court concluded, because: (1) success on Vickie's counterclaim did not necessitate any declaration that J. Howard's will was invalid, 264 B. R., at 621; and (2) under Texas law, probate courts do not have exclusive jurisdiction to entertain claims of the kind asserted in Vickie's counterclaim, <i>id.,</i> at 622-625.</p>\n<p>The District Court also held that Vickie's claim did not qualify as a \"core proceedin[g] arising under title 11, or arising in a case under title 11.\" 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 157(b)(1); see 264 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*303</span> B. R., at 625-632. A bankruptcy court may exercise plenary power only over \"core proceedings.\" See \u00a7 157(b)-(c).<sup>[2]</sup> In noncore matters, a bankruptcy court may not enter final judgment; it has authority to issue only proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, which are reviewed <i>de novo</i> by the district court. See \u00a7 157(c)(1). Accordingly, the District Court treated the Bankruptcy Court's judgment as \"proposed[,] rather than final,\" and undertook a \"comprehensive, complete, and independent review of\" the Bankruptcy Court's determinations. <i>Id.,</i> at 633.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*304</span> Adopting and supplementing the Bankruptcy Court's findings, the District Court determined that Pierce had tortiously interfered with Vickie's expectancy. Specifically, the District Court found that J. Howard directed his lawyers to prepare an <i>inter vivos</i> trust for Vickie consisting of half the appreciation of his assets from the date of their marriage. See 275 B. R., at 25-30, 51-53. It further found that Pierce conspired to suppress or destroy the trust instrument and to strip J. Howard of his assets by backdating, altering, and otherwise falsifying documents, arranging for surveillance of J. Howard and Vickie, and presenting documents to J. Howard under false pretenses. See <i>id.,</i> at 36-50, 57-58; see also 253 B. R., at 554-556, 559-560. Based on these findings, the District Court awarded Vickie some $44.3 million in compensatory damages. 275 B. R., at 53-57. In addition, finding \"overwhelming\" evidence of Pierce's \"willfulness, maliciousness, and fraud,\" the District Court awarded an equal amount in punitive damages. <i>Id.,</i> at 57-58.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. The appeals court recognized that Vickie's claim \"does not involve the administration of an estate, the probate of a will, or any other purely probate matter.\" 392 F. 3d, at 1133. Nevertheless, the court held that the probate exception bars federal jurisdiction in this case. In the Ninth Circuit's view, a claim falls within the probate exception if it raises \"questions which would ordinarily be decided by a probate court in determining the validity of the decedent's estate planning instrument,\" whether those questions involve \"fraud, undue influence[, or] tortious interference with the testator's intent.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit was also of the view that state-court delineation of a probate court's exclusive adjudicatory authority could control federal subject-matter jurisdiction. In this regard, the Court of Appeals stated: \"Where a state has relegated jurisdiction over probate matters to a special court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*305</span> and [the] state's trial courts of general jurisdiction do not have jurisdiction to hear probate matters, then the federal courts also lack jurisdiction over probate matters.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1136. Noting that \"[t]he [P]robate [C]ourt ruled it had exclusive jurisdiction over all of Vickie[`s] claims,\" the Ninth Circuit held that \"ruling . . . binding on the United States [D]istrict [C]ourt.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (citing <i>Durfee</i> v. <i>Duke,</i> 375 U. S. 106, 115-116 (1963)).</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 545 U. S. 1165 (2005), to resolve the apparent confusion among federal courts concerning the scope of the probate exception. Satisfied that the instant case does not fall within the ambit of the narrow exception recognized by our decisions, we reverse the Ninth Circuit's judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>In <i>Ankenbrandt</i> v. <i>Richards,</i> 504 U. S. 689 (1992), we addressed both the derivation and the limits of the \"domestic relations exception\" to the exercise of federal jurisdiction. Carol Ankenbrandt, a citizen of Missouri, brought suit in Federal District Court on behalf of her daughters, naming as defendants their father (Ankenbrandt's former husband) and his female companion, both citizens of Louisiana. <i>Id.,</i> at 691. Ankenbrandt's complaint sought damages for the defendants' alleged sexual and physical abuse of the children. <i>Ibid.</i> Federal jurisdiction was predicated on diversity of citizenship. <i>Ibid.</i> (citing 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1332). The District Court dismissed the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, holding that Ankenbrandt's suit fell within \"the `domestic relations' exception to diversity jurisdiction.\" 504 U. S., at 692. The Court of Appeals agreed and affirmed. <i>Ibid.</i> We reversed the Court of Appeals' judgment. <i>Id.,</i> at 706-707.</p>\n<p>Holding that the District Court improperly refrained from exercising jurisdiction over Ankenbrandt's tort claim, <i>id.,</i> at 704, we traced explanation of the current domestic relations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*306</span> exception to <i>Barber</i> v. <i>Barber,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87254\"><a href=\"/opinion/87254/barber-v-barber/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span></a></span> (1859). See <i>Ankenbrandt,</i> 504 U. S., at 693-695. In <i>Barber,</i> the Court upheld federal-court authority, in a diversity case, to enforce an alimony award decreed by a state court. In dicta, however, the <i>Barber</i> Court announced\u0097without citation or discussion\u0097 that federal courts lack jurisdiction over suits for divorce or the allowance of alimony. 21 How., at 584-589; see <i>Ankenbrandt,</i> 504 U. S., at 693-695.</p>\n<p>Finding no Article III impediment to federal-court jurisdiction in domestic relations cases, <i>id.,</i> at 695-697, the Court in <i>Ankenbrandt</i> anchored the exception in Congress' original provision for diversity jurisdiction, <i>id.,</i> at 698-701. Beginning at the beginning, the Court recalled:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The Judiciary Act of 1789 provided that `the circuit courts shall have original cognizance, concurrent with the courts of the several States, of <i>all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity, where the matter in dispute exceeds,</i> exclusive of costs, the sum or value of <i>five hundred dollars,</i> and . . . an alien is a party, or the suit is <i>between a citizen of the State where the suit is brought, and a citizen of another State.</i>'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 698 (quoting Act of Sept. 24, 1789, \u00a7 11, 1 Stat. 78; emphasis added in <i>Ankenbrandt</i>).</blockquote>\n<p>The defining phrase, \"all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity,\" the Court stressed, remained in successive statutory provisions for diversity jurisdiction until 1948, when Congress adopted the more economical phrase, \"all civil actions.\" 504 U. S., at 698; 1948 Judicial Code and Judiciary Act, 62 Stat. 930, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n<p>The <i>Barber</i> majority, we acknowledged in <i>Ankenbrandt,</i> did not expressly tie its announcement of a domestic relations exception to the text of the diversity statute. 504 U. S., at 698. But the dissenters in that case made the connection. They stated that English courts of chancery lacked <span class=\"star-pagination\">*307</span> authority to issue divorce and alimony decrees. Because \"the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States in chancery is bounded by that of the chancery in England,\" <i>Barber,</i> 21 How., at 605 (opinion of Daniel, J.), the dissenters reasoned, our federal courts similarly lack authority to decree divorces or award alimony, <i>ibid.</i> Such relief, in other words, would not fall within the diversity statute's original grant of jurisdiction over \"all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity.\" We concluded in <i>Ankenbrandt</i> that \"it may be inferred fairly that the jurisdictional limitation recognized by the <i>[Barber]</i> Court rested on th[e] statutory basis\" indicated by the dissenters in that case. 504 U. S., at 699.</p>\n<p>We were \"content\" in <i>Ankenbrandt</i> \"to rest our conclusion that a domestic relations exception exists as a matter of statutory construction not on the accuracy of the historical justifications on which [the exception] was seemingly based.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 700. \"[R]ather,\" we relied on \"Congress' apparent acceptance of this construction of the diversity jurisdiction provisions in the years prior to 1948, when the statute limited jurisdiction to `suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting 1 Stat. 78). We further determined that Congress did not intend to terminate the exception in 1948 when it \"replace[d] the law/equity distinction with the phrase `all civil actions.'\" 504 U. S., at 700. Absent contrary indications, we presumed that Congress meant to leave undisturbed \"the Court's nearly century-long interpretation\" of the diversity statute \"to contain an exception for certain domestic relations matters.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>We nevertheless emphasized in <i>Ankenbrandt</i> that the exception covers only \"a narrow range of domestic relations issues.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 701. The <i>Barber</i> Court itself, we reminded, \"sanctioned the exercise of federal jurisdiction over the enforcement of an alimony decree that had been properly obtained in a state court of competent jurisdiction.\" 504 U. S., at 702. Noting that some lower federal courts had applied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*308</span> the domestic relations exception \"well beyond the circumscribed situations posed by <i>Barber</i> and its progeny,\" <i>id.,</i> at 701, we clarified that only \"divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees\" remain outside federal jurisdictional bounds, <i>id.,</i> at 703, 704. While recognizing the \"special proficiency developed by state tribunals . . . in handling issues that arise in the granting of [divorce, alimony, and child custody] decrees,\" <i>id.,</i> at 704, we viewed federal courts as equally equipped to deal with complaints alleging the commission of torts, <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Federal jurisdiction in this case is premised on 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1334, the statute vesting in federal district courts jurisdiction in bankruptcy cases and related proceedings. Decisions of this Court have recognized a \"probate exception,\" kin to the domestic relations exception, to otherwise proper federal jurisdiction. See <i>Markham,</i> 326 U. S., at 494; see also <i>Sutton</i> v. <i>English,</i> 246 U. S. 199 (1918); <i>Waterman</i> v. <i>Canal-Louisiana Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 215 U. S. 33 (1909). Like the domestic relations exception, the probate exception has been linked to language contained in the Judiciary Act of 1789.</p>\n<p><i>Markham,</i> the Court's most recent and pathmarking pronouncement on the probate exception, stated that \"the equity jurisdiction conferred by the Judiciary Act of 1789 . . ., which is that of the English Court of Chancery in 1789, did not extend to probate matters.\" 326 U. S., at 494. See generally Nicolas, Fighting the Probate Mafia: A Dissection of the Probate Exception to Federal Court Jurisdiction, 74 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1479 (2001). As in <i>Ankenbrandt,</i> so in this case, \"[w]e have no occasion . . . to join the historical debate\" over the scope of English chancery jurisdiction in 1789, 504 U. S., at 699, for Vickie Marshall's claim falls far outside the bounds of the probate exception described in <i>Markham.</i> We therefore need not consider in this case whether there exists any <span class=\"star-pagination\">*309</span> uncodified probate exception to federal bankruptcy jurisdiction under \u00a7 1334.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>Markham,</i> the plaintiff Alien Property Custodian <sup>[4]</sup> commenced suit in Federal District Court against an executor and resident heirs to determine the Custodian's asserted rights regarding a decedent's estate. 326 U. S., at 491-492. Jurisdiction was predicated on \u00a7 24(1) of the Judicial Code, now 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1345, which provides for federal jurisdiction over suits brought by an officer of the United States. At the time the federal suit commenced, the estate was undergoing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*310</span> probate administration in a state court. The Custodian had issued an order vesting in himself all right, title, and interest of German legatees. He sought and gained in the District Court a judgment determining that the resident heirs had no interest in the estate, and that the Custodian, substituting himself for the German legatees, was entitled to the entire net estate, including specified real estate passing under the will.</p>\n<p>Reversing the Ninth Circuit, which had ordered the case dismissed for want of federal subject-matter jurisdiction, this Court held that federal jurisdiction was properly invoked. The Court first stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"It is true that a federal court has no jurisdiction to probate a will or administer an estate . . . . But it has been established by a long series of decisions of this Court that federal courts of equity have jurisdiction to entertain suits `in favor of creditors, legatees and heirs' and other claimants against a decedent's estate `to establish their claims' so long as the federal court does not interfere with the probate proceedings or assume general jurisdiction of the probate or control of the property in the custody of the state court.\" 326 U. S., at 494 (quoting <i>Waterman,</i> 215 U. S., at 43).</blockquote>\n<p>Next, the Court described a probate exception of distinctly limited scope:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[W]hile a federal court may not exercise its jurisdiction to disturb or affect the possession of property in the custody of a state court, . . . it may exercise its jurisdiction to adjudicate rights in such property where the final judgment does not undertake to interfere with the state court's possession save to the extent that the state court is bound by the judgment to recognize the right adjudicated by the federal court.\" 326 U. S., at 494.</blockquote>\n<p>The first of the above-quoted passages from <i>Markham</i> is not a model of clear statement. The Court observed that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*311</span> federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain suits to determine the rights of creditors, legatees, heirs, and other claimants against a decedent's estate, \"so long as the federal court does not <i>interfere with the probate proceedings.</i>\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). Lower federal courts have puzzled over the meaning of the words \"interfere with the probate proceedings,\" and some have read those words to block federal jurisdiction over a range of matters well beyond probate of a will or administration of a decedent's estate. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Mangieri</i> v. <i>Mangieri,</i> 226 F. 3d 1, 2-3 (CA1 2000) (breach of fiduciary duty by executor); <i>Golden ex rel. Golden</i> v. <i>Golden,</i> 382 F. 3d 348, 360-362 (CA3 2004) (same); <i>Lepard</i> v. <i>NBD Bank, Div. of Bank One,</i> 384 F. 3d 232, 234-237 (CA6 2004) (breach of fiduciary duty by trustee); <i>Storm</i> v. <i>Storm,</i> 328 F. 3d 941, 943-945 (CA7 2003) (probate exception bars claim that plaintiff's father tortiously interfered with plaintiff's inheritance by persuading trust grantor to amend irrevocable <i>inter vivos</i> trust); <i>Rienhardt</i> v. <i>Kelly,</i> 164 F. 3d 1296, 1300-1301 (CA10 1999) (probate exception bars claim that defendants exerted undue influence on testator and thereby tortiously interfered with plaintiff's expected inheritance).</p>\n<p>We read <i>Markham</i>'s enigmatic words, in sync with the second above-quoted passage, to proscribe \"disturb[ing] or affect[ing] the possession of property in the custody of a state court.\" 326 U. S., at 494. True, that reading renders the first-quoted passage in part redundant, but redundancy in this context, we do not doubt, is preferable to incoherence. In short, we comprehend the \"interference\" language in <i>Markham</i> as essentially a reiteration of the general principle that, when one court is exercising <i>in rem</i> jurisdiction over a <i>res,</i> a second court will not assume <i>in rem</i> jurisdiction over the same <i>res.</i> See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Penn General Casualty Co.</i> v. <i>Pennsylvania ex rel. Schnader,</i> 294 U. S. 189, 195-196 (1935); <i>Waterman,</i> 215 U. S., at 45-46. Thus, the probate exception reserves to state probate courts the probate or annulment of a will and the administration of a decedent's estate; it also <span class=\"star-pagination\">*312</span> precludes federal courts from endeavoring to dispose of property that is in the custody of a state probate court. But it does not bar federal courts from adjudicating matters outside those confines and otherwise within federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>As the Court of Appeals correctly observed, Vickie's claim does not \"involve the administration of an estate, the probate of a will, or any other purely probate matter.\" 392 F. 3d, at 1133. Provoked by Pierce's claim in the bankruptcy proceedings, Vickie's claim, like Carol Ankenbrandt's, alleges a widely recognized tort. See <i>King</i> v. <i>Acker,</i> 725 S. W. 2d 750, 754 (Tex. App. 1987); 4 Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 774B (1977) (\"One who by fraud, duress or other tortious means intentionally prevents another from receiving from a third person an inheritance or gift that [s]he would otherwise have received is subject to liability to the other for loss of the inheritance or gift.\"). Vickie seeks an <i>in personam</i> judgment against Pierce, not the probate or annulment of a will. Cf. <i>Sutton,</i> 246 U. S., at 208 (suit to annul a will found \"supplemental to the proceedings for probate of the will\" and therefore not cognizable in federal court). Nor does she seek to reach a <i>res</i> in the custody of a state court. See <i>Markham,</i> 326 U. S., at 494.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, no \"sound policy considerations\" militate in favor of extending the probate exception to cover the case at hand. Cf. <i>Ankenbrandt,</i> 504 U. S., at 703. Trial courts, both federal and state, often address conduct of the kind Vickie alleges. State probate courts possess no \"special proficiency . . . in handling [such] issues.\" Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 704.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The Court of Appeals advanced an alternate basis for its conclusion that the federal courts lack jurisdiction over Vickie's claim. Noting that the Texas Probate Court \"ruled it had exclusive jurisdiction over all of Vickie Lynn Marshall's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*313</span> claims against E. Pierce Marshall,\" the Ninth Circuit held that \"ruling . . . binding on the United States [D]istrict [C]ourt.\" 392 F. 3d, at 1136. We reject that determination.</p>\n<p>Texas courts have recognized a state-law tort action for interference with an expected inheritance or gift, modeled on the Restatement formulation. See <i>King,</i> 725 S. W. 2d, at 754; <i>Brandes</i> v. <i>Rice Trust, Inc.,</i> 966 S. W. 2d 144, 146-147 (Tex. App. 1998).<sup>[5]</sup> It is clear, under <i>Erie R. Co.</i> v. <i>Tompkins,</i> 304 U. S. 64 (1938), that Texas law governs the substantive elements of Vickie's tortious interference claim. It is also clear, however, that Texas may not reserve to its probate courts the exclusive right to adjudicate a transitory <span class=\"star-pagination\">*314</span> tort. We have long recognized that \"a State cannot create a transitory cause of action and at the same time destroy the right to sue on that transitory cause of action in any court having jurisdiction.\" <i>Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; R. Co.</i> v. <i>George,</i> 233 U. S. 354, 360 (1914). Jurisdiction is determined \"by the law of the court's creation and cannot be defeated by the extraterritorial operation of a [state] statute . . ., even though it created the right of action.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Directly on point, we have held that the jurisdiction of the federal courts, \"having existed from the beginning of the Federal government, [can]not be impaired by subsequent state legislation creating courts of probate.\" <i>McClellan</i> v. <i>Carland,</i> 217 U. S. 268, 281 (1910) (upholding federal jurisdiction over action by heirs of decedent, who died intestate, to determine their rights in the estate (citing <i>Waterman,</i> 215 U. S. 33)).</p>\n<p>Our decision in <i>Durfee</i> v. <i>Duke,</i> 375 U. S. 106 (1963), relied upon by the Ninth Circuit, 392 F. 3d, at 1136, is not to the contrary. <i>Durfee</i> stands only for the proposition that a state court's final judgment determining <i>its own</i> jurisdiction ordinarily qualifies for full faith and credit, so long as the jurisdictional issue was fully and fairly litigated in the court that rendered the judgment. See 375 U. S., at 111, 115. At issue here, however, is not the Texas Probate Court's jurisdiction, but the federal courts' jurisdiction to entertain Vickie's tortious interference claim. Under our federal system, Texas cannot render its probate courts exclusively competent to entertain a claim of that genre. We therefore hold that the District Court properly asserted jurisdiction over Vickie's counterclaim against Pierce.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>After determining that Vickie's claim was not a \"core proceeding,\" the District Court reviewed the case <i>de novo</i> and entered its final judgment on March 7, 2002. 275 B. R., at 5-8. The Texas Probate Court's judgment became final on February 11, 2002, nearly one month earlier. App. to Pet. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*315</span> for Cert. 41. The Court of Appeals considered only the issue of federal subject-matter jurisdiction. It did not address the question whether Vickie's claim was \"core\"; nor did it address Pierce's arguments concerning claim and issue preclusion. 392 F. 3d, at 1137. These issues remain open for consideration on remand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>The administration of decedents' estates typically is governed by rules of state law and conducted by state probate courts. Occasionally, however, disputes between interested parties arise, either in the probate proceeding itself or elsewhere, that qualify as cases or controversies that federal courts have jurisdiction to decide. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Reed</i> v. <i>Reed,</i> 404 U. S. 71 (1971). In her opinion for the Court, Justice GINSBURG has cogently explained why this is such a case. I write separately to explain why I do not believe there is any \"probate exception\" that ousts a federal court of jurisdiction it otherwise possesses.</p>\n<p>The familiar aphorism that hard cases make bad law should extend to easy cases as well. <i>Markham</i> v. <i>Allen,</i> 326 U. S. 490 (1946), like this case, was an easy case. In <i>Markham,</i> as here, it was unnecessary to question the historical or logical underpinnings of the probate exception to federal jurisdiction because, whatever the scope of the supposed exception, it did not extend to the case at hand. But <i>Markham</i>'s obiter dicta\u0097dicta that the Court now describes as redundant if not incoherent, <i>ante,</i> at 311\u0097generated both <span class=\"star-pagination\">*316</span> confusion and abdication of the obligation Chief Justice Marshall so famously articulated, see <i>Cohens</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85330\"><a href=\"/opinion/85330/cohens-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span>, 404 (1821); see also <i>ante,</i> at 298-299. While the Court today rightly abandons much of that dicta, I would go further.</p>\n<p>The Court is content to adopt the approach it followed in <i>Ankenbrandt</i> v. <i>Richards,</i> 504 U. S. 689 (1992), and to accept as foundation for the probate exception <i>Markham</i>'s bald assertion that the English High Court of Chancery's jurisdiction did not \"extend to probate matters\" in 1789. 326 U. S., at 494; see <i>ante,</i> at 308. I would not accept that premise. Not only had the theory <i>Markham</i> espoused been only sporadically and tentatively cited as justification for the exception,<sup>[1]</sup> but the most comprehensive article on the subject has persuasively demonstrated that <i>Markham</i>'s assertion is \"an exercise in mythography.\"<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Markham</i>'s theory apparently is the source of the Court's reformulated exception, which \"reserves to state probate courts the probate or annulment of a will and the administration of a decedent's estate.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 311. Although undoubtedly narrower in scope than <i>Markham</i>'s ill-considered description of the probate carve-out, this description also <span class=\"star-pagination\">*317</span> sweeps too broadly. For the Court has correctly upheld the exercise of federal jurisdiction over actions involving the annulment of wills and the administration of decedents' estates. In <i>Gaines</i> v. <i>Fuentes,</i> 92 U. S. 10 (1876), for example, the Court held that a defendant in an action to annul a will should be permitted to remove the case to federal court. In so doing, it explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[W]henever a controversy in a suit . . . arises respecting the validity or construction of a will, or the enforcement of a decree admitting it to probate, there is no more reason why the Federal courts should not take jurisdiction of the case than there is that they should not take jurisdiction of any other controversy between the parties.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 22.</blockquote>\n<p>Likewise, in <i>Payne</i> v. <i>Hook,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88024\"><a href=\"/opinion/88024/payne-v-hook/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></a></span> (1869), the Court explained that it was \"well settled that a court of chancery, as an incident to its power to enforce trusts, and make those holding a fiduciary relation account, has jurisdiction to compel executors and administrators to account and distribute the assets in their hands.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 431. (In that same case, a federal court later appointed a Special Master to administer the estate. This Court upheld some of the Master's determinations and rejected others. See <i>Hook</i> v. <i>Payne,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88534\"><a href=\"/opinion/88534/hook-v-payne/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span>, 255 (1872).)</p>\n<p>To be sure, there are cases that support limitations on federal courts' jurisdiction over the probate and annulment of wills and the administration of decedents' estates. But careful examination reveals that at least most of the limitations so recognized stem not from some <i>sui generis</i> exception, but rather from generally applicable jurisdictional rules. Cf. <i>Ellis</i> v. <i>Davis,</i> 109 U. S. 485, 497 (1883) (\"Jurisdiction as to wills, and their probate as such, is neither included in nor excepted out of the grant of judicial power to the courts of the United States\"). Some of those rules, like the rule that diversity jurisdiction will not attach absent an <i>inter</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*318</span> <i>partes</i> controversy, plainly are still relevant today. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Waterman</i> v. <i>Canal-Louisiana Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 215 U. S. 33, 44-45 (1909); see also <i>id.,</i> at 46 (reaffirming the <i>in gremio legis</i> principle). Others, like the rule that a bill in equity will lie only where there is no adequate remedy elsewhere, have less straightforward application in the wake of 20th-century jurisdictional developments. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Case of Broderick's Will,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"89035\"><a href=\"/opinion/89035/case-of-brodericks-will/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></a></span>, 510-512 (1875); <i>Ellis,</i> 109 U. S., at 503 (denying relief where plaintiff had \"a plain, adequate and complete remedy at law\"); see also Winkler, <i>supra</i> n. 2, at 112-113. Whatever the continuing viability of these individual rules, together they are more than adequate to the task of cabining federal courts' jurisdiction. They require no helping hand from the so-called probate exception.</p>\n<p>Rather than preserving whatever vitality that the \"exception\" has retained as a result of the <i>Markham</i> dicta, I would provide the creature with a decent burial in a grave adjacent to the resting place of the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine.

App., authorizes the President to appoint an official known as the \"alien property custodian,\" who is responsible for \"receiv[ing,] . . . hold[ing], administer[ing], and account[ing] for\" \"all money and property in the United States due or belonging to an enemy, or ally of enemy . . . .\" The Act was originally enacted during World War I \"to permit, under careful safeguards and restrictions, certain kinds of business to be carried on\" among warring nations, and to \"provid[e] for the care and administration of the property and property rights of enemies and their allies in this country pending the war.\" <i>Markham</i> v. <i>Cabell,</i> 326 U. S. 404, 414, n. 1 (1945) (Burton, J., concurring) (quoting S. Rep. No. 113, 65th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1917)).</p>\n<p>[5]  Texas appellate courts have on occasion held claims of tortious interference with an expected inheritance \"barred\" by a prior probate court judgment, apparently applying ordinary principles of preclusion. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Thompson</i> v. <i>Deloitte &amp; Touche,</i> 902 S. W. 2d 13, 16 (Tex. App. 1995) (final probate court judgment bars claim of tortious interference with inheritance expectancy because probate court \"necessarily found that [the decedent] signed the will with testamentary capacity, and that it reflected his intent, was not the result of coercion or undue influence, and was valid\"); <i>Neill</i> v. <i>Yett,</i> 746 S. W. 2d 32, 35-36 (Tex. App. 1988) (complaint alleging fraud and tortious interference with inheritance expectancy, filed more than two years after will was admitted to probate, was barred by both the statute of limitations and the final probate judgment, and failed to state the elements of the claim). Neither <i>Thompson</i> nor <i>Neill</i> questions the Texas trial courts' subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims in question.\n</p>\n<p>Pierce maintains that <i>Thompson, Neill,</i> and other Texas decisions support his contention that preclusion principles bar Vickie's claim. See Brief for Respondent 36-38. Vickie argues to the contrary. See Brief for Petitioner 42, n. 30 (urging that preclusion does not apply because (1) Vickie's claim was not litigated to final judgment in the Texas probate proceedings; (2) having presented her claim in the Bankruptcy Court years before she joined the Texas will contest, Vickie was not obliged to present her claim in the Texas proceedings; (3) the Bankruptcy Court's judgment preceded the Probate Court judgment; and (4) the Texas Probate Court did not have before it important evidence). See also Tex. Rule Civ. Proc. 97 (2003); <i>Ingersoll-Rand Co.</i> v. <i>Valero Energy Corp.,</i> 997 S. W. 2d 203, 206-207 (Tex. 1999). The matter of preclusion remains open for consideration on remand. See <i>infra,</i> at 315.</p>\n<p>[1]  Notably, Justice Joseph Bradley, a strong proponent of the theory that federal courts sitting in equity cannot exercise jurisdiction over probate matters because in England in 1789 such jurisdiction belonged to the ecclesiastical courts, see <i>Case of Broderick's Will,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"89035\"><a href=\"/opinion/89035/case-of-brodericks-will/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></a></span> (1875), <i>Gaines</i> v. <i>Fuentes,</i> 92 U. S. 10, 24-25 (1876) (dissenting opinion), urged that \"even in matters savoring of [e]cclesiastical process, after an issue has been formed between definite parties,\" the controversy should be heard by a federal court. See <i>Rosenbaum</i> v. <i>Bauer,</i> 120 U. S. 450, 460-461 (1887) (dissenting opinion) (citing <i>Gaines,</i> 92 U. S., at 17, and <i>Hess</i> v. <i>Reynolds,</i> 113 U. S. 73 (1885)).</p>\n<p>[2]  Winkler, The Probate Jurisdiction of the Federal Courts, 14 Probate L. J. 77, 126 (1997); see <i>ante,</i> at 299 (acknowledging Winkler's analysis). Winkler also observes, citing Charles Dickens' Bleak House (1853), that <i>Markham</i>'s \"suggestion that the High Court of Chancery had lacked jurisdiction to `administer an estate' was preposterous.\" 14 Probate L. J., at 125, and n. 256.</p>\n\n</div>",
