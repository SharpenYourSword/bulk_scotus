S. 306, 313 (1950). We granted certiorari to determine whether, when notice of a tax sale is mailed to the owner and returned undelivered, the government must take additional reasonable steps to provide notice before taking the owner's property.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In 1967, petitioner Gary Jones purchased a house at 717 North Bryan Street in Little Rock, Arkansas. He lived in the house with his wife until they separated in 1993. Jones then moved into an apartment in Little Rock, and his wife continued to live in the North Bryan Street house. Jones paid his mortgage each month for 30 years, and the mortgage company paid Jones' property taxes. After Jones paid off his mortgage in 1997, the property taxes went unpaid, and the property was certified as delinquent.</p>\n<p>In April 2000, respondent Mark Wilcox, the Commissioner of State Lands (Commissioner), attempted to notify Jones of his tax delinquency, and his right to redeem the property, by mailing a certified letter to Jones at the North Bryan Street address. See Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 26-37-301 (1997). The packet of information stated that unless Jones redeemed the property, it would be subject to public sale two years later on April 17, 2002. See <i>ibid.</i> Nobody was home to sign for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*224</span> the letter, and nobody appeared at the post office to retrieve the letter within the next 15 days. The post office returned the unopened packet to the Commissioner marked \"`unclaimed.'\" Pet. for Cert. 3.</p>\n<p>Two years later, and just a few weeks before the public sale, the Commissioner published a notice of public sale in the Arkansas Democrat Gazette. No bids were submitted, which permitted the State to negotiate a private sale of the property. See \u00a7 26-37-202(b). Several months later, respondent Linda Flowers submitted a purchase offer. The Commissioner mailed another certified letter to Jones at the North Bryan Street address, attempting to notify him that his house would be sold to Flowers if he did not pay his taxes. Like the first letter, the second was also returned to the Commissioner marked \"unclaimed.\" Pet. for Cert. 3. Flowers purchased the house, which the parties stipulated in the trial court had a fair market value of $80,000, for $21,042.15. Record 224. Immediately after the 30-day period for postsale redemption passed, see \u00a7 26-37-202(e), Flowers had an unlawful detainer notice delivered to the property. The notice was served on Jones' daughter, who contacted Jones and notified him of the tax sale. <i>Id.,</i> at 11 (Exh. B).</p>\n<p>Jones filed a lawsuit in Arkansas state court against the Commissioner and Flowers, alleging that the Commissioner's failure to provide notice of the tax sale and of Jones' right to redeem resulted in the taking of his property without due process. The Commissioner and Flowers moved for summary judgment on the ground that the two unclaimed letters sent by the Commissioner were a constitutionally adequate attempt at notice, and Jones filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner and Flowers. App. to Pet. for Cert. 12a-13a. It concluded that the Arkansas tax sale statute, which set forth the notice procedure followed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*225</span> by the Commissioner, complied with constitutional due process requirements.</p>\n<p>Jones appealed, and the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's judgment. 359 Ark. 443, 198 S. W. 3d 520 (2004). The court noted our precedent stating that due process does not require actual notice, see <i>Dusenbery</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 534 U. S. 161, 170 (2002), and it held that attempting to provide notice by certified mail satisfied due process in the circumstances presented, 359 Ark., at 453-454, 198 S. W. 3d, at 526-527.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 545 U. S. 1165 (2005), to resolve a conflict among the Circuits and State Supreme Courts concerning whether the Due Process Clause requires the government to take additional reasonable steps to notify a property owner when notice of a tax sale is returned undelivered. Compare, <i>e. g., </i><i>Akey</i> v. <i>Clinton County,</i> 375 F. 3d 231, 236 (CA2 2004) (\"In light of the notice's return, the County was required to use `reasonably diligent efforts' to ascertain Akey's correct address\"), and <i>Kennedy</i> v. <i>Mossafa,</i> 100 N. Y. 2d 1, 9, 789 N. E. 2d 607, 611 (2003) (\"[W]e reject the view that the enforcing officer's obligation is always satisfied by sending the notice to the address listed in the tax roll, even where the notice is returned as undeliverable\"), with <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Cliffs on the Bay Condominium Assn.,</i> 463 Mich. 420, 429, 617 N. W. 2d 536, 541 (2000) <i>(per curiam)</i> (\"The fact that one of the mailings was returned by the post office as undeliverable does not impose on the state the obligation to undertake an investigation to see if a new address . . . could be located\"). We hold that when mailed notice of a tax sale is returned unclaimed, the State must take additional reasonable steps to attempt to provide notice to the property owner before selling his property, if it is practicable to do so. Under the circumstances presented here, additional reasonable steps were available to the State. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Arkansas Supreme Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*226</span> II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Due process does not require that a property owner receive actual notice before the government may take his property. <i>Dusenbery, supra,</i> at 170. Rather, we have stated that due process requires the government to provide \"notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\" <i>Mullane,</i> 339 U. S., at 314. The Commissioner argues that once the State provided notice reasonably calculated to apprise Jones of the impending tax sale by mailing him a certified letter, due process was satisfied. The Arkansas statutory scheme is reasonably calculated to provide notice, the Commissioner continues, because it provides for notice by certified mail to an address that the property owner is responsible for keeping up to date. See Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 26-35-705 (1997). The Commissioner notes this Court's ample precedent condoning notice by mail, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Dusenbery, supra,</i> at 169; <i>Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc.</i> v. <i>Pope,</i> 485 U. S. 478, 490 (1988); <i>Mennonite Bd. of Missions</i> v. <i>Adams,</i> 462 U. S. 791, 798 (1983); <i>Mullane, supra,</i> at 318-319, and adds that the Arkansas scheme exceeds constitutional requirements by requiring the Commissioner to use certified mail. Brief for Respondent Commissioner 14-15.</p>\n<p>It is true that this Court has deemed notice constitutionally sufficient if it was reasonably calculated to reach the intended recipient when sent. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Dusenbery, supra,</i> at 168-169; <i>Mullane,</i> 339 U. S., at 314. In each of these cases, the government attempted to provide notice and heard nothing back indicating that anything had gone awry, and we stated that \"[t]he reasonableness and hence the constitutional validity of [the] chosen method may be defended on the ground that it is in itself reasonably certain to inform those affected.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 315; see also <i>Dusenbery, supra,</i> at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*227</span> 170. But we have never addressed whether due process entails further responsibility when the government becomes aware prior to the taking that its attempt at notice has failed. That is a new wrinkle, and we have explained that the \"notice required will vary with circumstances and conditions.\" <i>Walker</i> v. <i>City of Hutchinson,</i> 352 U. S. 112, 115 (1956). The question presented is whether such knowledge on the government's part is a \"circumstance and condition\" that varies the \"notice required.\"</p>\n<p>The Courts of Appeals and State Supreme Courts have addressed this question on frequent occasions, and most have decided that when the government learns its attempt at notice has failed, due process requires the government to do something more before real property may be sold in a tax sale.<sup>[1]</sup> See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Plemons</i> v. <i>Gale,</i> 396 F. 3d 569, 576 (CA4 2005); <i>Akey, supra,</i> at 236; <i>Hamilton</i> v. <i>Renewed Hope, Inc.,</i> 277 Ga. 465, 468, 589 S. E. 2d 81, 85 (2003); <i>Kennedy, supra,</i> at 9, 789 N. E. 2d, at 611; <i>Malone</i> v. <i>Robinson,</i> 614 A. 2d 33, 38 (D. C. App. 1992) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>St. George Antiochian Orthodox Christian Church</i> v. <i>Aggarwal,</i> 326 Md. 90, 103, 603 A. 2d 484, 490 (1992); <i>Wells Fargo Credit Corp.</i> v. <i>Ziegler,</i> 780 P. 2d 703, 705 (Okla. 1989); <i>Rosenberg</i> v. <i>Smidt,</i> 727 P. 2d 778, 780-783 (Alaska 1986); <i>Giacobbi</i> v. <i>Hall,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*228</span> 109 Idaho 293, 297, 707 P. 2d 404, 408 (1985); <i>Tracy</i> v. <i>County of Chester, Tax Claim Bureau,</i> 507 Pa. 288, 296, 489 A. 2d 1334, 1338-1339 (1985). But see <i>Smith,</i> 463 Mich., at 429, 617 N. W. 2d, at 541; <i>Dahn</i> v. <i>Trownsell,</i> 1998 SD 36, \u00b6 23, 576 N. W. 2d 535, 541-542; <i>Elizondo</i> v. <i>Read,</i> 588 N. E. 2d 501, 504 (Ind. 1992); <i>Atlantic City</i> v. <i>Block C-11, Lot 11,</i> 74 N. J. 34, 39-40, 376 A. 2d 926, 928 (1977). Many States already require in their statutes that the government do more than simply mail notice to delinquent owners, either at the outset or as a followup measure if initial mailed notice is ineffective.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*229</span> In <i>Mullane,</i> we stated that \"when notice is a person's due . . . [t]he means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it,\" 339 U. S., at 315, and that assessing the adequacy of a particular form of notice requires balancing the \"interest of the State\" against \"the individual interest sought to be protected by the Fourteenth Amendment,\" <i>id.,</i> at 314. Our leading cases on notice have evaluated the adequacy of notice given to beneficiaries of a common trust fund, <i>Mullane, supra</i><i>;</i> a mortgagee, <i>Mennonite,</i> 462 U. S. 791; owners of seized cash and automobiles, <i>Dusenbery,</i> 534 U. S. 161; <i>Robinson</i> v. <i>Hanrahan,</i> 409 U. S. 38 (1972) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>;</i> creditors of an estate, <i>Tulsa Professional,</i> 485 U. S. 478; and tenants living in public housing, <i>Greene</i> v. <i>Lindsey,</i> 456 U. S. 444 (1982). In this case, we evaluate the adequacy of notice prior to the State extinguishing a property owner's interest in a home.</p>\n<p>We do not think that a person who actually desired to inform a real property owner of an impending tax sale of a house he owns would do nothing when a certified letter sent to the owner is returned unclaimed. If the Commissioner prepared a stack of letters to mail to delinquent taxpayers, handed them to the postman, and then watched as the departing postman accidentally dropped the letters down a storm drain, one would certainly expect the Commissioner's office to prepare a new stack of letters and send them again. No one \"desirous of actually informing\" the owners would simply shrug his shoulders as the letters disappeared and say \"I tried.\" Failure to follow up would be unreasonable, despite the fact that the letters were reasonably calculated to reach their intended recipients when delivered to the postman.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*230</span> By the same token, when a letter is returned by the post office, the sender will ordinarily attempt to resend it, if it is practicable to do so. See <i>Small</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 136 F. 3d 1334, 1337 (CADC 1998). This is especially true when, as here, the subject matter of the letter concerns such an important and irreversible prospect as the loss of a house. Although the State may have made a reasonable calculation of how to reach Jones, it had good reason to suspect when the notice was returned that Jones was \"no better off than if the notice had never been sent.\" <i>Malone,</i> 614 A. 2d, at 37. Deciding to take no further action is not what someone \"desirous of actually informing\" Jones would do; such a person would take further reasonable steps if any were available.</p>\n<p>In prior cases, we have required the government to consider unique information about an intended recipient regardless of whether a statutory scheme is reasonably calculated to provide notice in the ordinary case. In <i>Robinson</i> v. <i>Hanrahan</i><i>,</i> we held that notice of forfeiture proceedings sent to a vehicle owner's home address was inadequate when the State knew that the property owner was in prison. 409 U. S., at 40. In <i>Covey</i> v. <i>Town of Somers,</i> 351 U. S. 141 (1956), we held that notice of foreclosure by mailing, posting, and publication was inadequate when town officials knew that the property owner was incompetent and without a guardian's protection. <i>Id.,</i> at 146-147.</p>\n<p>The Commissioner points out that in these cases, the State was aware of such information <i>before</i> it calculated how best to provide notice. But it is difficult to explain why due process would have settled for something less if the government had learned after notice was sent, but before the taking occurred, that the property owner was in prison or was incompetent. Under <i>Robinson</i> and <i>Covey,</i> the government's knowledge that notice pursuant to the normal procedure was ineffective triggered an obligation on the government's part to take additional steps to effect notice. That knowledge was one of the \"practicalities and peculiarities of the case,\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*231</span> <i>Mullane, supra,</i> at 314-315, that the Court took into account in determining whether constitutional requirements were met. It should similarly be taken into account in assessing the adequacy of notice in this case. The dissent dismisses the State's knowledge that its notice was ineffective as \"learned long after the fact,\" <i>post,</i> at 246, n. 5 (opinion of Thomas, J.), but the notice letter was promptly returned to the State two to three weeks after it was sent, and the Arkansas statutory regime precludes the State from taking the property for two <i>years</i> while the property owner may exercise his right to redeem, see Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 26-37-301 (Supp. 2005).</p>\n<p>It is certainly true, as the Commissioner and Solicitor General contend, that the failure of notice in a specific case does not establish the inadequacy of the attempted notice; in that sense, the constitutionality of a particular procedure for notice is assessed <i>ex ante,</i> rather than <i>post hoc.</i> But if a feature of the State's chosen procedure is that it promptly provides additional information to the government about the effectiveness of notice, it does not contravene the <i>ex ante</i> principle to consider what the government does with that information in assessing the adequacy of the chosen procedure. After all, the State knew <i>ex ante</i> that it would promptly learn whether its effort to effect notice through certified mail had succeeded. It would not be inconsistent with the approach the Court has taken in notice cases to ask, with respect to a procedure under which telephone calls were placed to owners, what the State did when no one answered. Asking what the State does when a notice letter is returned unclaimed is not substantively different.</p>\n<p>The Commissioner has three further arguments for why reasonable followup measures were not required in this case. First, notice was sent to an address that Jones provided and had a legal obligation to keep updated. See Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 26-35-705 (1997). Second, \"after failing to receive a property tax bill and pay property taxes, a property holder is on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*232</span> inquiry-notice that his property is subject to governmental taking.\" Brief for Respondent Commissioner 18-19. Third, Jones was obliged to ensure that those in whose hands he left his property would alert him if it was in jeopardy. None of these contentions relieves the State of its constitutional obligation to provide adequate notice.</p>\n<p>The Commissioner does not argue that Jones' failure to comply with a statutory obligation to keep his address updated forfeits his right to constitutionally sufficient notice, and we agree. <i>Id.,</i> at 19; see also Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 16, n. 5 (\"`[A] party's ability to take steps to safeguard its own interests does not relieve the State of its constitutional obligation'\" (quoting <i>Mennonite,</i> 462 U. S., at 799)). In <i>Robinson,</i> we noted that Illinois law required each vehicle owner to register his address with the secretary of state, and that the State's vehicle forfeiture scheme provided for notice by mail to the address listed in the secretary's records. See 409 U. S., at 38, n. 1 (citing Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 95\u00bd, \u00a7 3-405 (1971), and ch. 38, \u00a7 36-1 (1969)). But we found that the State had not provided constitutionally sufficient notice, despite having followed its reasonably calculated scheme, because it knew that Robinson could not be reached at his address of record. 409 U. S., at 39-40. Although Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 26-35-705 provides strong support for the Commissioner's argument that mailing a certified letter to Jones at 717 North Bryan Street was reasonably calculated to reach him, it does not alter the reasonableness of the Commissioner's position that he must do nothing more when the notice is promptly returned \"unclaimed.\"</p>\n<p>As for the Commissioner's inquiry notice argument, the common knowledge that property may become subject to government taking when taxes are not paid does not excuse the government from complying with its constitutional obligation of notice before taking private property. We have previously stated the opposite: An interested party's \"knowledge of delinquency in the payment of taxes is not equivalent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*233</span> to notice that a tax sale is pending.\" <i>Mennonite, supra,</i> at 800. It is at least as widely known that arrestees have the right to remain silent, and that anything they say may be used against them, see <i>Dickerson</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 530 U. S. 428, 443 (2000) (\"<i>Miranda</i> [v. <i>Arizona,</i> 384 U. S. 436 (1966),] has become embedded in routine police practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our national culture\"), but that knowledge does not excuse a police failure to provide <i>Miranda</i> warnings. Arkansas affords even a delinquent taxpayer the right to settle accounts with the State and redeem his property, so Jones' failure to pay his taxes in a timely manner cannot by itself excuse inadequate notice.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Commissioner reminds us of a statement from <i>Mullane</i> that the State can assume an owner leaves his property in the hands of one who will inform him if his interest is in jeopardy. 339 U. S., at 316. But in this passage, Justice Jackson writes of \"libel of a ship, attachment of a chattel[,] or entry upon real estate in the name of law\"\u0097such \"seiz[ures]\" of property, he concluded, \"may reasonably be expected to come promptly to the owner's attention.\" <i>Ibid.</i> An occupant, however, is not charged with acting as the owner's agent in all respects, and it is quite a leap from Justice Jackson's examples to conclude that it is an obligation of tenancy to follow up with certified mail of unknown content addressed to the owner. In fact, the State makes it impossible for the occupant to learn why the Commissioner is writing the owner, because an occupant cannot call for a certified letter without first obtaining the owner's signature. For all the occupant knows, the Commissioner of State Lands might write to certain residents about a variety of matters he finds important, such as state parks or highway construction; it would by no means be obvious to an occupant observing a certified mail slip from the Commissioner that the owner is in danger of losing his property. In any event, there is no record evidence that notices of attempted delivery were left at 717 North Bryan Street.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*234</span> Jones should have been more diligent with respect to his property, no question. People must pay their taxes, and the government may hold citizens accountable for tax delinquency by taking their property. But before forcing a citizen to satisfy his debt by forfeiting his property, due process requires the government to provide adequate notice of the impending taking. U. S. Const., Amdt. 14; <i>Mennonite, supra,</i> at 799.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In response to the returned form suggesting that Jones had not received notice that he was about to lose his property, the State did\u0097nothing. For the reasons stated, we conclude the State should have taken additional reasonable steps to notify Jones, if practicable to do so. The question remains whether there were any such available steps. While \"[i]t is not our responsibility to prescribe the form of service that the [government] should adopt,\" <i>Greene,</i> 456 U. S., at 455, n. 9, if there were no reasonable additional steps the government could have taken upon return of the unclaimed notice letter, it cannot be faulted for doing nothing.</p>\n<p>We think there were several reasonable steps the State could have taken. What steps are reasonable in response to new information depends upon what the new information reveals. The return of the certified letter marked \"unclaimed\" meant either that Jones still lived at 717 North Bryan Street, but was not home when the postman called and did not retrieve the letter at the post office, or that Jones no longer resided at that address. One reasonable step primarily addressed to the former possibility would be for the State to resend the notice by regular mail, so that a signature was not required. The Commissioner says that use of certified mail makes actual notice more likely, because requiring the recipient's signature protects against misdelivery. But that is only true, of course, when someone is home to sign for the letter, or to inform the mail carrier that he has arrived at the wrong address. Otherwise, \"[c]ertified <span class=\"star-pagination\">*235</span> mail is dispatched and handled in transit as ordinary mail,\" United States Postal Service, Domestic Mail Manual \u00a7 503.3.2.1 (Mar. 16, 2006), and the use of certified mail might make actual notice less likely in some cases\u0097the letter cannot be left like regular mail to be examined at the end of the day, and it can only be retrieved from the post office for a specified period of time. Following up with regular mail might also increase the chances of actual notice to Jones if\u0097 as it turned out\u0097he had moved. Even occupants who ignored certified mail notice slips addressed to the owner (if any had been left) might scrawl the owner's new address on the notice packet and leave it for the postman to retrieve, or notify Jones directly.</p>\n<p>Other reasonable followup measures, directed at the possibility that Jones had moved as well as that he had simply not retrieved the certified letter, would have been to post notice on the front door, or to address otherwise undeliverable mail to \"occupant.\" Most States that explicitly outline additional procedures in their tax sale statutes require just such steps. See n. 2, <i>supra.</i> Either approach would increase the likelihood that the owner would be notified that he was about to lose his property, given the failure of a letter deliverable only to the owner in person. That is clear in the case of an owner who still resided at the premises. It is also true in the case of an owner who has moved: Occupants who might disregard a certified mail slip not addressed to them are less likely to ignore posted notice, and a letter addressed to them (even as \"occupant\") might be opened and read. In either case, there is a significant chance the occupants will alert the owner, if only because a change in ownership could well affect their own occupancy. In fact, Jones first learned of the State's effort to sell his house when he was alerted by one of the occupants\u0097his daughter\u0097after she was served with an unlawful detainer notice.</p>\n<p>Jones believes that the Commissioner should have searched for his new address in the Little Rock phonebook <span class=\"star-pagination\">*236</span> and other government records such as income tax rolls. We do not believe the government was required to go this far. As the Commissioner points out, the return of Jones' mail marked \"unclaimed\" did not necessarily mean that 717 North Bryan Street was an incorrect address; it merely informed the Commissioner that no one appeared to sign for the mail before the designated date on which it would be returned to the sender. An open-ended search for a new address\u0097 especially when the State obligates the taxpayer to keep his address updated with the tax collector, see Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 26-35-705 (1997)\u0097imposes burdens on the State significantly greater than the several relatively easy options outlined above.</p>\n<p>The Commissioner complains about the burden of even those additional steps, but his argument is belied by Arkansas' current requirement that notice to homestead owners be accomplished by personal service if certified mail is returned, \u00a7 26-37-301(e) (Supp. 2005), and the fact that Arkansas transfers the cost of notice to the taxpayer or the tax sale purchaser, \u00a7 26-37-104(a). The Commissioner has offered no estimate of how many notice letters are returned, and no facts to support the dissent's assertion that the Commissioner must now physically locate \"tens of thousands of properties every year.\" <i>Post,</i> at 248. Citing our decision in <i>Greene</i> v. <i>Lindsey</i><i>,</i> the Solicitor General adds that posted notice could be taken down by children or vandals. But in <i>Greene,</i> we noted that outside the specific facts of that case, posting notice on real property is \"a singularly appropriate and effective way of ensuring that a person . . . is actually apprised of proceedings against him.\" 456 U. S., at 452-453. Successfully providing notice is often the most efficient way to collect unpaid taxes, see <i>Mennonite,</i> 462 U. S., at 800, n. 5 (more effective notice may ease burden on State if recipient arranges to pay delinquent taxes prior to tax sale); Tr. of Oral Arg. 24 (85 percent of tax delinquent properties in Arkansas are redeemed upon notice of delinquency), but rather <span class=\"star-pagination\">*237</span> than taking relatively easy additional steps to effect notice, the State undertook the burden and expense of purchasing a newspaper advertisement, conducting an auction, and then negotiating a private sale of the property to Flowers.</p>\n<p>The Solicitor General argues that requiring further effort when the government learns that notice was not delivered will cause the government to favor modes of providing notice that do not generate additional information\u0097for example, starting (and stopping) with regular mail instead of certified mail. We find this unlikely, as we have no doubt that the government repeatedly finds itself being asked to prove that notice was sent and received. Using certified mail provides the State with documentation of personal delivery and protection against false claims that notice was never received. That added security, however, comes at a price\u0097the State also learns when notice has <i>not</i> been received. We conclude that, under the circumstances presented, the State cannot simply ignore that information in proceeding to take and sell the owner's property\u0097any more than it could ignore the information that the owner in <i>Robinson</i> was in jail, or that the owner in <i>Covey</i> was incompetent.</p>\n<p>Though the Commissioner argues that followup measures are not constitutionally required, he reminds us that the State did make some attempt to follow up with Jones by publishing notice in the newspaper a few weeks before the public sale. Several decades ago, this Court observed that \"[c]hance alone\" brings a person's attention to \"an advertisement in small type inserted in the back pages of a newspaper,\" <i>Mullane,</i> 339 U. S., at 315, and that notice by publication is adequate only where \"it is not reasonably possible or practicable to give more adequate warning,\" <i>id.,</i> at 317. Following up by publication was not constitutionally adequate under the circumstances presented here because, as we have explained, it was possible and practicable to give Jones more adequate warning of the impending tax sale.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*238</span> The dissent forcefully articulates some basic principles about constitutionally required notice, principles from which we have no intention to depart. In particular, we disclaim any \"new rule\" that is \"contrary to <i>Dusenbery</i> and a significant departure from <i>Mullane.</i>\" <i>Post,</i> at 244. In <i>Dusenbery,</i> the Government was aware that someone at the prison had signed for the prisoner's notice letter, and we determined that this attempt at notice was adequate, despite the fact that the State could have made notice more likely by requiring the prisoner to sign for the letter himself. 534 U. S., at 171. In this case, of course, the notice letter was returned to the Commissioner, informing him that his attempt at notice had failed.</p>\n<p>As for <i>Mullane,</i> it directs that \"when notice is a person's due . . . [t]he means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.\" 339 U. S., at 315. Mindful of the dissent's concerns, we conclude, at the end of the day, that someone who actually wanted to alert Jones that he was in danger of losing his house would do more when the attempted notice letter was returned unclaimed, and there was more that reasonably could be done.</p>\n<p>As noted, \"[i]t is not our responsibility to prescribe the form of service that the [government] should adopt.\" <i>Greene, supra,</i> at 455, n. 9. In prior cases finding notice inadequate, we have not attempted to redraft the State's notice statute. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Tulsa Professional,</i> 485 U. S., at 490-491; <i>Robinson,</i> 409 U. S., at 40; <i>Schroeder</i> v. <i>City of New York,</i> 371 U. S. 208, 213-214 (1962); <i>Walker,</i> 352 U. S., at 116; <i>Covey,</i> 351 U. S., at 146-147. The State can determine how to proceed in response to our conclusion that notice was inadequate here, and the States have taken a variety of approaches to the present question. See n. 2, <i>supra.</i> It suffices for present purposes that we are confident that additional reasonable steps were available for Arkansas to employ before taking Jones' property.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*239</span> * * *</h2>\n<p>There is no reason to suppose that the State will ever be less than fully zealous in its efforts to secure the tax revenue it needs. The same cannot be said for the State's efforts to ensure that its citizens receive proper notice before the State takes action against them. In this case, the State is exerting extraordinary power against a property owner\u0097taking and selling a house he owns. It is not too much to insist that the State do a bit more to attempt to let him know about it when the notice letter addressed to him is returned unclaimed.</p>\n<p>The Commissioner's effort to provide notice to Jones of an impending tax sale of his house was insufficient to satisfy due process given the circumstances of this case. The judgment of the Arkansas Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA and JUSTICE KENNEDY join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>When petitioner failed to pay his property taxes for several consecutive years, respondent Commissioner of State Lands in Arkansas, using the record address that petitioner provided to the State, sent petitioner a letter by certified mail, noting his tax delinquency and explaining that his property would be subject to public sale if the delinquent taxes and penalties were not paid. After petitioner failed to respond, the State also published notice of the delinquency and public sale in an Arkansas newspaper. Soon after respondent Linda K. Flowers submitted a purchase offer to the State, it sent petitioner a second letter by certified mail explaining <span class=\"star-pagination\">*240</span> that the sale would proceed if the delinquent taxes and penalties were not paid.</p>\n<p>Petitioner argues that the State violated his rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because, in his view, the State failed to take sufficient steps to contact him before selling his property to Flowers. Petitioner contends that once the State became aware that he had not claimed the certified mail, it was constitutionally obligated to employ additional methods to locate him.</p>\n<p>Adopting petitioner's arguments, the Court holds today that \"when mailed notice of a tax sale is returned unclaimed, the State must take additional reasonable steps to attempt to provide notice to the property owner before selling his property, if it is practicable to do so.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 225. The Court concludes that it was practicable for Arkansas to take additional steps here\u0097namely, notice by regular mail, posting notice on petitioner's door, and addressing mail to \"`occupant.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 235. Because, under this Court's precedents, the State's notice methods clearly satisfy the requirements of the Due Process Clause, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the States from \"depriv[ing] any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" This Court has held that a State must provide an individual with notice and opportunity to be heard before the State may deprive him of his property. <i>Mullane</i> v. <i>Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 339 U. S. 306, 313 (1950). Balancing a State's interest in efficiently managing its administrative system and an individual's interest in adequate notice, this Court has held that a State must provide \"notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 313-314. As this Court has explained, \"when notice is a person's due . . . [t]he means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee <span class=\"star-pagination\">*241</span> might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 315. \"[H]eroic efforts,\" however, are not required. <i>Dusenbery</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 534 U. S. 161, 170 (2002). To the contrary, we have expressly rejected \"[a] construction of the Due Process Clause which would place impossible or impractical obstacles in the way [of the State].\" <i>Mullane, supra,</i> at 313-314. Thus, \"none of our cases . . . has required actual notice\"; instead, \"we have allowed the Government to defend the `reasonableness and hence the constitutional validity of any chosen method . . . on the ground that it is in itself reasonably certain to inform those affected.'\" <i>Dusenbery, supra,</i> at 169-170 (quoting <i>Mullane, supra,</i> at 315).</p>\n<p>The methods of notice employed by Arkansas were reasonably calculated to inform petitioner of proceedings affecting his property interest and thus satisfy the requirements of the Due Process Clause. The State mailed a notice by certified letter to the address provided by petitioner. The certified letter was returned to the State marked \"unclaimed\" after three attempts to deliver it. The State then published a notice of public sale containing redemption information in the Arkansas Democrat Gazette newspaper. After Flowers submitted a purchase offer, the State sent yet another certified letter to petitioner at his record address. That letter, too, was returned to the State marked \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Arkansas' attempts to contact petitioner by certified mail at his \"record address,\" without more, satisfy due process. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*242</span> <i>Dusenbery, supra,</i> at 169. See also <i>Mullane, supra,</i> at 318; <i>Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc.</i> v. <i>Pope,</i> 485 U. S. 478, 490 (1988) (\"We have repeatedly recognized that mail service is an inexpensive and efficient mechanism that is reasonably calculated to provide actual notice\"); <i>Mennonite Bd. of Missions</i> v. <i>Adams,</i> 462 U. S. 791, 792, 798 (1983) (holding that \"notice <i>mailed</i> to [the affected party's] <i>last known available address</i>\" is sufficient where a State seeks to sell \"real property on which payments of property taxes have been delinquent\" (emphasis added)). Because the notices were sent to the address provided by petitioner himself, the State had an especially sound basis for determining that notice would reach him. Moreover, Arkansas exceeded the constitutional minimum by additionally publishing notice in a local newspaper.<sup>[2]</sup> See <i>Mullane, supra,</i> at 318. Due process requires nothing more\u0097and certainly not here, where petitioner had a statutory duty to pay his taxes and to report any change of address to the state taxing authority. See Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 26-35-705 (1997).</p>\n<p>My conclusion that Arkansas' notice methods satisfy due process is reinforced by the well-established presumption that individuals, especially those owning property, act in their own interest. Recognizing that \"`[i]t is the part of common prudence for all those who have any interest in [a thing], to guard that interest by persons who are in a situation to protect it,'\" <i>Mullane, supra,</i> at 316 (quoting <i>The Mary,</i> 9 Cranch 126, 144 (1815)), this Court has concluded that \"[t]he ways of an owner with tangible property are such that he usually arranges means to learn of any direct attack upon his possessory or proprietary rights,\" <i>Mullane,</i> 339 U. S., at 316. Consistent with this observation, Arkansas was free to \"indulge the assumption\" that petitioner had <span class=\"star-pagination\">*243</span> either provided the state taxing authority with a correct and up-to-date mailing address\u0097as required by state law\u0097\"or that he . . . left some caretaker under a duty to let him know that [his property was] being jeopardized.\"<sup>[3]</sup><i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Court does not conclude that certified mail is inherently insufficient as a means of notice, but rather that \"the government's knowledge that notice pursuant to the normal procedure was ineffective triggered an obligation on the government's part to take additional steps to effect notice.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 230. I disagree.</p>\n<p>First, whether a method of notice is reasonably calculated to notify the interested party is determined <i>ex ante, i. e.,</i> from the viewpoint of the government agency at the time its notice is sent. This follows from <i>Mullane,</i> where this Court rested its analysis on the information the sender had \"at hand\" when its notice was sent. 339 U. S., at 318. Relatedly, we have refused to evaluate the reasonableness of a particular method of notice by comparing it to alternative methods that are identified after the fact. See <i>Dusenbery,</i> 534 U. S., at 171-172. Today the Court appears to abandon both of these practices. Its rejection of Arkansas' selected method of notice\u0097a method this Court has repeatedly concluded is constitutionally sufficient\u0097is based upon information that was unavailable when notice was sent. Indeed, the Court's proposed notice methods\u0097regular mail, posting, and addressing mail to \"`occupant,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 234-235\u0097are entirely the product of <i>post hoc</i> considerations, including the discovery that members of petitioner's family continued to live in the house. Similarly, the Court's observation that \"[t]he Commissioner[`s] complain[t] about the burden of . . . additional steps . . . is belied by Arkansas' current requirement that notice to homestead owners be accomplished by personal service if certified mail is returned,\" <i>ante,</i> at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*244</span> 236, is contrary to <i>Dusenbery</i>'s \"conclusion that the Government ought not be penalized and told to `try harder' . . . simply because [it] has since upgraded its policies,\" 534 U. S., at 172.</p>\n<p>Second, implicit in our holding that due process does not require \"actual notice,\" see <i>id.,</i> at 169-170, is that when the \"government becomes aware . . . that its attempt at notice has failed,\" <i>ante,</i> at 227, it is not required to take additional steps to ensure that notice has been received. Petitioner's challenge to Arkansas' notice methods, and the Court's acceptance of it, is little more than a thinly veiled attack on <i>Dusenbery.</i> Under the majority's logic, each time a doubt is raised with respect to whether notice has reached an interested party, the State will have to consider additional means better calculated to achieve notice. Because this rule turns on speculative, newly acquired information, it has no natural end point, and, in effect, requires the States to achieve something close to actual notice. The majority's new rule is contrary to <i>Dusenbery</i> and a significant departure from <i>Mullane.</i></p>\n<p>The only circumstances in which this Court has found notice by mail and publication inadequate under the Due Process Clause involve situations where the state or local government knew at the outset that its notice efforts were destined to fail and knew how to rectify the problem prior to sending notice. See <i>Robinson</i> v. <i>Hanrahan,</i> 409 U. S. 38, 39 (1972) <i>(per curiam)</i> (intended recipient known to be in jail); <i>Covey</i> v. <i>Town of Somers,</i> 351 U. S. 141, 145 (1956) (intended recipient known to be incompetent and without a guardian).</p>\n<p>In <i>Robinson,</i> the State, having arrested petitioner and having detained him in county jail, immediately instituted forfeiture proceedings against his automobile and mailed notice of those proceedings to his residential address. 409 U. S., at 38. Robinson, who was incarcerated in the county jail during the entirety of the forfeiture proceedings, did not receive notice of the proceedings until after he was released <span class=\"star-pagination\">*245</span> and the forfeiture order had been entered. <i>Id.,</i> at 38-39. Because the State knew beforehand that Robinson was not at, and had no access to, the address to which it sent the notice, this Court held that the State's efforts were not \"`reasonably calculated'\" to notify him of the pending proceedings. <i>Id.,</i> at 40. Similarly, in <i>Covey,</i> the Court concluded that the methods of notice used by the town\u0097mailing, posting, and publishing\u0097were not reasonably calculated to inform Covey of proceedings adverse to her property interests because local officials knew prior to sending notice that she was \"without mental capacity to handle her affairs\" and unable to comprehend the meaning of the notices. 351 U. S., at 144, 146.</p>\n<p>By contrast, Arkansas did not know at the time it sent notice to petitioner that its method would fail, and Arkansas did not know that petitioner no longer lived at the record address simply because letters were returned \"unclaimed.\" Pet. for Cert. 3. \"[U]nclaimed\" does not necessarily mean that an address is no longer correct; it may indicate that an intended recipient has simply failed or refused to claim mail. See United States Postal Service, Domestic Mail Manual (DMM), \u00a7 507, Exh. 1.4.1, http://pe.usps.gov/ text/dmm300/507.htm.<sup>[4]</sup> Given that the State had been using the address provided by petitioner and that petitioner had a legal duty to maintain a current mailing address with the state taxing authority, return of the mail as \"unclaimed\" did not arm Arkansas with the type of specific knowledge that the governments had at hand in <i>Robinson</i> and <i>Covey.</i> Cf. <i>ante,</i> at 234. The State cannot be charged to correct a problem of petitioner's own creation and of which it was not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*246</span> aware.<sup>[5]</sup> Even if the State had divined that petitioner was no longer at the record address, its publication of notice in a local newspaper would have sufficed because <i>Mullane</i> authorizes the use of publication when the record address is unknown. See 339 U. S., at 316 (\"[P]ublication traditionally has been acceptable as notification supplemental to other action which in itself may reasonably be expected to convey a warning\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The Court's proposed methods, aside from being constitutionally unnecessary, are also burdensome, impractical, and no more likely to effect notice than the methods actually employed by the State.</p>\n<p>In Arkansas, approximately 18,000 parcels of delinquent real estate are certified annually. <i>Tsann Kuen Enterprises Co.</i> v. <i>Campbell,</i> 355 Ark. 110, 119-120, 129 S. W. 3d 822, 828 (2003). Under the Court's rule, the State will bear the burden of locating thousands of delinquent property owners. These administrative burdens are not compelled by the Due Process Clause. See <i>Mullane, supra,</i> at 313-314; <i>Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc.,</i> 485 U. S., at 489-490 (stating that constitutionally sufficient notice \"need not be inefficient or burdensome\"). Here, Arkansas has determined that its law requiring property owners to maintain a current address with the state taxing authority, in conjunction with its authorization to send property notices to the record address, is an efficient and fair way to administer its tax collection system. The Court's decision today forecloses <span class=\"star-pagination\">*247</span> such a reasonable system and burdens the State with inefficiencies caused by delinquent taxpayers.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Court's proposed methods are no more reasonably calculated to achieve notice than the methods employed by the State here. Regular mail is hardly foolproof; indeed, it is arguably less effective than certified mail. Certified mail is tracked, delivery attempts are recorded, actual delivery is logged, and notices are posted to alert someone at the residence that certified mail is being held at a local post office. By creating a record, these features give parties grounds for defending or challenging notice. By contrast, regular mail is untraceable; there is no record of either delivery or receipt. Had the State used regular mail, petitioner would presumably argue that it should have sent notice by certified mail because it creates a paper trail.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court itself recognizes the deficiencies of its proposed methods. It acknowledges that \"[f]ollowing up with regular mail <i>might</i> . . . increase the chances of actual notice\"; \"occupants who ignored certified mail notice slips . . . <i>might</i> scrawl the owner's new address on the notice packet,\" <i>ante,</i> at 235 (emphasis added); and \"a letter addressed to [occupant] <i>might</i> be opened and read,\" <i>ibid.</i> (emphasis added). Nevertheless, the Court justifies its redrafting of Arkansas' notice statute <span class=\"star-pagination\">*248</span> on the ground that \"[its] approach[es] would increase the likelihood that the owner would be notified that he was about to lose his property . . . .\" <i>Ibid.</i> That, however, is not the test; indeed, we rejected such reasoning in <i>Dusenbery.</i> See 534 U. S., at 171 (rejecting the argument that \"the FBI's notice was constitutionally flawed because it was `substantially less likely to bring home notice' than a feasible substitute\" (some internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>The Court's suggestion that Arkansas post notice is similarly unavailing. The State's records are organized by legal description, not address, which makes the prospect of physically locating tens of thousands of properties every year, and posting notice on each, impractical. See <i>Tsann Kuen Enterprises Co., supra,</i> at 119-120, 129 S. W. 3d, at 828. Also, this Court has previously concluded that posting is an inherently unreliable method of notice. See <i>Greene</i> v. <i>Lindsey,</i> 456 U. S. 444, 453-454 (1982).</p>\n<p>Similarly, addressing the mail to \"`occupant,'\" see <i>ante,</i> at 235, is no more reasonably calculated to reach petitioner. It is sheer speculation to assume, as the Court does, that although \"[o]ccupants . . . might disregard a certified mail slip . . ., . . . a letter addressed to them (even as `occupant') might be opened and read.\" <i>Ibid.</i> It is at least as likely that an occupant who receives generically addressed mail will discard it as junk mail.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>If \"title to property should not depend on [factual] vagaries,\" <i>Dusenbery, supra,</i> at 171, then certainly it cannot turn on \"wrinkle[s],\" <i>ante,</i> at 227, caused by a property owner's own failure to be a prudent ward of his interests. The meaning of the Constitution should not turn on the antics of tax evaders and scofflaws. Nor is the self-created conundrum in which petitioner finds himself a legitimate ground for imposing additional constitutional obligations on the State. The State's attempts to notify petitioner by certified <span class=\"star-pagination\">*249</span> mail at the address that he provided and, additionally, by publishing notice in a local newspaper satisfy due process. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Arkansas Supreme Court.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Most Courts of Appeals have also concluded that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires the Federal Government to take further reasonable steps in the property forfeiture context. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>Ritchie,</i> 342 F. 3d 903, 911 (CA9 2003); <i>Foehl</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 238 F. 3d 474, 480 (CA3 2001); <i>Small</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 136 F. 3d 1334, 1337-1338 (CADC 1998); <i>Torres</i> v. <i>$36,256.80 U.

Rather, the issue is whether petitioner discharged his <i>own</i> duty to guard his interests.</p>\n<p>[4]  The Postal Service uses \"Moved, Left No Address\" to indicate that the \"[a]ddressee moved and filed no change-of-address order,\" and \"Not Deliverable as Addressed\u0097Unable to Forward\" to indicate that the mail is \"undeliverable at address given; no change-of-address order on file; forwarding order expired.\" DMM \u00a7 507, Exh. 1.4.1.</p>\n<p>[5]  The Court's \"storm drain\" hypothetical, <i>ante,</i> at 229, presents the harder question of when notice is sent\u0097at the precise moment the Commissioner places the mail in the postal carrier's hand or the split second later when he observes the departing carrier drop the mail down the storm drain. That more difficult question is not before us in this case because Arkansas learned long after the fact that its attempts had been unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>[6]  Interestingly, the Court stops short of saddling the State with the other steps that petitioner argues a State should take any time the interested party fails to claim letters mailed to his record address, see <i>ante,</i> at 235-236, namely, searching state tax records, the phonebook, the Internet, department of motor vehicle records, or voting rolls, contacting his employer, or employing debt collectors. Here, the Court reasons that because of the context\u0097the fact that the letter was returned merely \"unclaimed\" and petitioner had a duty to maintain a current address\u0097the State is not required to go as far as petitioner urges. <i>Ante,</i> at 236. Though the methods proposed by petitioner are severely flawed (for instance, the commonality of his surname \"Jones\" calls into question the fruitfulness of Internet and phonebook searches), there is no principled basis for the Court's conclusion that petitioner's other proposed methods would \"impos[e] burdens on the State significantly greater than the several relatively easy options outlined [by the Court].\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n\n</div>",

FLOWERS ET AL.\n\n       CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ARKANSAS\n\n    No. 04\u20131477. Argued January 17, 2006\u2014Decided April 26, 2006\nPetitioner Jones continued to pay the mortgage on his Arkansas home\n  after separating from his wife and moving elsewhere in the same city.\n  Once the mortgage was paid off, the property taxes\u2014which had been\n  paid by the mortgage company\u2014went unpaid, and the property was\n  certified as delinquent. Respondent Commissioner of State Lands\n  mailed Jones a certified letter at the property\u2019s address, stating that\n  unless he redeemed the property, it would be subject to public sale in\n  two years. Nobody was home to sign for the letter and nobody re\n  trieved it from the post office within 15 days, so it was returned to\n  the Commissioner, marked \u201cunclaimed.\u201d Two years later, the Com\n  missioner published a notice of public sale in a local newspaper. No\n  bids were submitted, so the State negotiated a private sale to respon\n  dent Flowers. Before selling the house, the Commissioner mailed an\n  other certified letter to Jones, which was also returned unclaimed.\n  Flowers purchased the house and had an unlawful detainer notice de\n  livered to the property. It was served on Jones\u2019 daughter, who noti\n  fied him of the sale. He filed a state-court suit against respondents,\n  alleging that the Commissioner\u2019s failure to provide adequate notice\n  resulted in the taking of his property without due process. Granting\n  respondents summary judgment, the trial court concluded that Ar\n  kansas\u2019 tax sale statute, which sets out the notice procedure used\n  here, complied with due process. The State Supreme Court affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. When mailed notice of a tax sale is returned unclaimed, a State\n must take additional reasonable steps to attempt to provide notice to\n the property owner before selling his property, if it is practicable to\n do so. Pp. 4\u201312.\n       (a) This Court has deemed notice constitutionally sufficient if it\n was reasonably calculated to reach the intended recipient when sent,\n2                          JONES v. FLOWERS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    see, e.g., Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S.\n    306, 314, but has never addressed whether due process requires fur\n    ther efforts when the government becomes aware prior to the taking\n    that its notice attempt has failed. Most Courts of Appeals and State\n    Supreme Courts addressing this question have decided that the gov\n    ernment must do more in such a case, and many state statutes re\n    quire more than mailed notice in the first instance. Pp. 4\u20136.\n         (b) The means a State employs to provide notice \u201cmust be such as\n    one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably\n    adopt to accomplish it.\u201d Mullane, 399 U. S., at 315. The adequacy of\n    a particular form of notice is assessed by balancing the State\u2019s inter\n    est against \u201cthe individual interest sought to be protected by the\n    Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d Id., at 314. Here, the evaluation concerns\n    the adequacy of notice prior to the State\u2019s extinguishing a property\n    owner\u2019s interest in a home. It is unlikely that a person who actually\n    desired to inform an owner about an impending tax sale of a house\n    would do nothing when a certified letter addressed to the owner is re\n    turned unclaimed. The sender would ordinarily attempt to resend\n    the letter, if that is practical, especially given that it concerns the\n    important and irreversible prospect of losing a house. The State may\n    have made a reasonable calculation of how to reach Jones, but it had\n    good reason to suspect when the notice was returned that Jones was\n    no better off than if no notice had been sent. The government must\n    consider unique information about an intended recipient regardless\n    of whether a statutory scheme is reasonably calculated to provide no\n    tice in the ordinary case. See Robinson v. Hanrahan, 409 U. S. 38, 40\n    (per curiam), and Covey v. Town of Somers, 351 U. S. 141, 146\u2013147.\n    It does not matter that the State in each of those cases was aware of\n    the information before it calculated the best way to send notice.\n    Knowledge that notice was ineffective was one of the \u201cpracticalities\n    and peculiarities of the case\u201d taken into account, Mullane, supra, at\n    314\u2013315, and it should similarly be taken into account in assessing\n    the adequacy of notice here. The Commissioner and Solicitor General\n    correctly note the constitutionality of that a particular notice proce\n    dure is assessed ex ante, not post hoc. But if a feature of the State\u2019s\n    procedure is that it promptly provides additional information to the\n    government about the effectiveness of attempted notice, the ex ante\n    principle is not contravened by considering what the government\n    does with that information. None of the Commissioner\u2019s additional\n    contentions\u2014that notice was sent to an address that Jones provided\n    and had a legal obligation to keep updated, that a property owner\n    who fails to receive a property tax bill and pay taxes is on inquiry no\n    tice that his property is subject to governmental taking, and that\n    Jones was obliged to ensure that those in whose hands he left his\n                      Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)                       3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  property would alert him if it was in jeopardy\u2014relieves the State of\n  its constitutional obligation to provide adequate notice. Pp. 7\u201312.\n     2. Because additional reasonable steps were available to the State,\n  given the circumstances here, the Commissioner\u2019s effort to provide\n  notice to Jones was insufficient to satisfy due process. What is rea\n  sonable in response to new information depends on what that infor\n  mation reveals. The certified letter\u2019s return \u201cunclaimed\u201d meant ei\n  ther that Jones was not home when the postman called and did not\n  retrieve the letter or that he no longer resided there. One reasonable\n  step addressed to the former possibility would be for the State to re-\n  send the notice by regular mail, which requires no signature. Certi\n  fied mail makes actual notice more likely only if someone is there to\n  sign for the letter or tell the mail carrier that the address is incorrect.\n  Regular mail can be left until the person returns home, and might in\n  crease the chances of actual notice. Other reasonable follow-up\n  measures would have been to post notice on the front door or address\n  otherwise undeliverable mail to \u201coccupant.\u201d Either approach would\n  increase the likelihood that any occupants would alert the owner, if\n  only because an ownership change could affect their own occupancy.\n  Contrary to Jones\u2019 claim, the Commissioner was not required to\n  search the local phone book and other government records. Such an\n  open-ended search imposes burdens on the State significantly greater\n  than the several relatively easy options outlined here. The Commis\n  sioner\u2019s complaint about the burden of even these additional steps is\n  belied by Arkansas\u2019 requirement that notice to homestead owners be\n  accomplished by personal service if certified mail is returned and by\n  the fact that the State transfers the cost of notice to the taxpayer or\n  tax sale purchaser. The Solicitor General\u2019s additional arguments\u2014\n  that posted notice could be removed by children or vandals, and that\n  the follow-up requirement will encourage States to favor modes of de\n  livery that will not generate additional information\u2014are rejected.\n  This Court will not prescribe the form of service that Arkansas\n  should adopt. Arkansas can determine how best to proceed, and the\n  States have taken a variety of approaches. Pp. 12\u201317.\n359 Ark. 443, ___ S. W. 3d ___, reversed and remanded.\n\n  ROBERTS, C.

Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co.,\n339 U. S. 306, 313 (1950). We granted certiorari to deter\nmine whether, when notice of a tax sale is mailed to the\nowner and returned undelivered, the government must take\nadditional reasonable steps to provide notice before taking\nthe owner\u2019s property.\n                               I\n  In 1967, petitioner Gary Jones purchased a house at 717\nNorth Bryan Street in Little Rock, Arkansas. He lived in\nthe house with his wife until they separated in 1993.\nJones then moved into an apartment in Little Rock, and\nhis wife continued to live in the North Bryan Street house.\nJones paid his mortgage each month for 30 years, and the\nmortgage company paid Jones\u2019 property taxes. After\nJones paid off his mortgage in 1997, the property taxes\n2                   JONES v. FLOWERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwent unpaid, and the property was certified as delinquent.\n  In April 2000, respondent Mark Wilcox, the Commis\nsioner of State Lands (Commissioner), attempted to notify\nJones of his tax delinquency, and his right to redeem the\nproperty, by mailing a certified letter to Jones at the\nNorth Bryan Street address. See Ark. Code Ann. \u00a726\u201337\u2013\n301 (1997). The packet of information stated that unless\nJones redeemed the property, it would be subject to public\nsale two years later on April 17, 2002. See ibid. Nobody\nwas home to sign for the letter, and nobody appeared at\nthe post office to retrieve the letter within the next 15\ndays. The post office returned the unopened packet to the\nCommissioner marked \u201c \u2018unclaimed.\u2019 \u201d Pet. for Cert. 3.\n  Two years later, and just a few weeks before the public\nsale, the Commissioner published a notice of public sale in\nthe Arkansas Democrat Gazette. No bids were submitted,\nwhich permitted the State to negotiate a private sale of\nthe property. See \u00a726\u201337\u2013202(b). Several months later,\nrespondent Linda Flowers submitted a purchase offer.\nThe Commissioner mailed another certified letter to Jones\nat the North Bryan Street address, attempting to notify\nhim that his house would be sold to Flowers if he did not\npay his taxes. Like the first letter, the second was also\nreturned to the Commissioner marked \u201cunclaimed.\u201d Ibid.\nFlowers purchased the house, which the parties stipulated\nin the trial court had a fair market value of $80,000, for\n$21,042.15. Record 224. Immediately after the 30-day\nperiod for postsale redemption passed, see \u00a726\u201337\u2013202(e),\nFlowers had an unlawful detainer notice delivered to the\nproperty. The notice was served on Jones\u2019 daughter, who\ncontacted Jones and notified him of the tax sale. Id., at 11\n(Exh. B).\n  Jones filed a lawsuit in Arkansas state court against the\nCommissioner and Flowers, alleging that the Commis\nsioner\u2019s failure to provide notice of the tax sale and of\nJones\u2019 right to redeem resulted in the taking of his prop\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nerty without due process. The Commissioner and Flowers\nmoved for summary judgment on the ground that the two\nunclaimed letters sent by the Commissioner were a consti\ntutionally adequate attempt at notice, and Jones filed a\ncross-motion for summary judgment. The trial court\ngranted summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner\nand Flowers. App. to Pet. for Cert. 12a\u201313a. It concluded\nthat the Arkansas tax sale statute, which set forth the\nnotice procedure followed by the Commissioner, complied\nwith constitutional due process requirements.\n   Jones appealed, and the Arkansas Supreme Court af\nfirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. 359 Ark. 443, ___ S. W.\n3d ___ (2004). The court noted our precedent stating that\ndue process does not require actual notice, see Dusenbery\nv. United States, 534 U. S. 161, 170 (2002), and it held\nthat attempting to provide notice by certified mail satis\nfied due process in the circumstances presented, 359 Ark.,\nat ___, ___ S. W. 3d, at ___.\n   We granted certiorari, 545 U. S. ___ (2005), to resolve a\nconflict among the Circuits and State Supreme Courts\nconcerning whether the Due Process Clause requires the\ngovernment to take additional reasonable steps to notify a\nproperty owner when notice of a tax sale is returned unde\nlivered. Compare, e.g., Akey v. Clinton County, 375 F. 3d\n231, 236 (CA2 2004) (\u201cIn light of the notice\u2019s return, the\nCounty was required to use \u2018reasonably diligent efforts\u2019 to\nascertain Akey\u2019s correct address\u201d), and Kennedy v. Mos\nsafa, 100 N. Y. 2d 1, 9, 789 N. E. 2d 607, 611 (2003) (\u201c[W]e\nreject the view that the enforcing officer\u2019s obligation is\nalways satisfied by sending the notice to the address listed\nin the tax roll, even where the notice is returned as unde\nliverable\u201d), with Smith v. Cliffs on the Bay Condominium\nAssn., 463 Mich. 420, 429, 617 N. W. 2d 536, 541 (2000)\n(per curiam) (\u201cThe fact that one of the mailings was re\nturned by the post office as undeliverable does not impose\non the state the obligation to undertake an investigation\n4                    JONES v. FLOWERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto see if a new address . . . could be located\u201d). We hold that\nwhen mailed notice of a tax sale is returned unclaimed,\nthe State must take additional reasonable steps to at\ntempt to provide notice to the property owner before sell\ning his property, if it is practicable to do so. Under the\ncircumstances presented here, additional reasonable steps\nwere available to the State. We therefore reverse the\njudgment of the Arkansas Supreme Court.\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n  Due process does not require that a property owner\nreceive actual notice before the government may take his\nproperty. Dusenbery, supra, at 170. Rather, we have\nstated that due process requires the government to pro\nvide \u201cnotice reasonably calculated, under all the circum\nstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of\nthe action and afford them an opportunity to present their\nobjections.\u201d Mullane, 339 U. S., at 314. The Commis\nsioner argues that once the State provided notice reasona\nbly calculated to apprise Jones of the impending tax sale\nby mailing him a certified letter, due process was satisfied.\nThe Arkansas statutory scheme is reasonably calculated to\nprovide notice, the Commissioner continues, because it\nprovides for notice by certified mail to an address that the\nproperty owner is responsible for keeping up to date. See\nArk. Code Ann. \u00a726\u201335\u2013705 (1997). The Commissioner\nnotes this Court\u2019s ample precedent condoning notice by\nmail, see, e.g., Dusenbery, supra, at 169; Tulsa Profes\nsional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485 U. S. 478, 490\n(1988); Mennonite Bd. of Missions v. Adams, 462 U. S. 791,\n798 (1983); Mullane, supra, at 318\u2013319, and adds that the\nArkansas scheme exceeds constitutional requirements by\nrequiring the Commissioner to use certified mail.

S. ____ (2006)                       5\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ntionally sufficient if it was reasonably calculated to reach\nthe intended recipient when sent. See, e.g., Dusenbery,\nsupra, at 168\u2013169; Mullane, 339 U. S., at 314. In each of\nthese cases, the government attempted to provide notice\nand heard nothing back indicating that anything had gone\nawry, and we stated that \u201c[t]he reasonableness and hence\nthe constitutional validity of [the] chosen method may be\ndefended on the ground that it is in itself reasonably\ncertain to inform those affected.\u201d Id., at 315; see also\nDusenbery, supra, at 170. But we have never addressed\nwhether due process entails further responsibility when\nthe government becomes aware prior to the taking that its\nattempt at notice has failed. That is a new wrinkle, and\nwe have explained that the \u201cnotice required will vary with\ncircumstances and conditions.\u201d Walker v. City of Hutchin\nson, 352 U. S. 112, 115 (1956). The question presented\nis whether such knowledge on the government\u2019s part is\na \u201ccircumstance and condition\u201d that varies the \u201cnotice\nrequired.\u201d\n   The Courts of Appeals and State Supreme Courts have\naddressed this question on frequent occasions, and most\nhave decided that when the government learns its attempt\nat notice has failed, due process requires the government\nto do something more before real property may be sold in a\ntax sale.1 See, e.g., Plemons v. Gale, 396 F. 3d 569, 576\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Most Courts of Appeals have also concluded that the Due Process\n\nClause of the Fifth Amendment requires the Federal Government to take\nfurther reasonable steps in the property forfeiture context. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Ritchie, 342 F. 3d 903, 911 (CA9 2003); Foehl v. United\nStates, 238 F. 3d 474, 480 (CA3 2001); Small v. United States, 136 F. 3d\n1334, 1337\u20131338 (CADC 1998); Torres v. $36,256.80 U. S. Currency, 25\nF. 3d 1154, 1161 (CA2 1994); Barrera-Montenegro v.

Meza, 235 F. 3d 287, 291 (CA7\n2000) (declining to adopt a per se rule that only examines notice at the\ntime it is sent, but also declining to impose an affirmative duty to seek out\nclaimants in every case where notice is returned undelivered).

[t]he means employed must be such as one desir\nous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably\nadopt to accomplish it,\u201d 339 U. S., at 315, and that assess\ning the adequacy of a particular form of notice requires\nbalancing the \u201cinterest of the State\u201d against \u201cthe individ\nual interest sought to be protected by the Fourteenth\nAmendment,\u201d id., at 314. Our leading cases on notice\nhave evaluated the adequacy of notice given to beneficiar\nies of a common trust fund, Mullane, supra; a mortgagee,\nMennonite, 462 U. S. 791; owners of seized cash and auto\nmobiles, Dusenbery, 534 U. S. 161; Robinson v. Hanrahan,\n409 U. S. 38 (1972) (per curiam); creditors of an estate,\nTulsa Professional, 485 U. S. 478; and tenants living in\npublic housing, Greene v. Lindsey, 456 U. S. 444 (1982). In\nthis case, we evaluate the adequacy of notice prior to the\nState extinguishing a property owner\u2019s interest in a home.\n  We do not think that a person who actually desired to\ninform a real property owner of an impending tax sale of a\nhouse he owns would do nothing when a certified letter\nsent to the owner is returned unclaimed. If the Commis\nsioner prepared a stack of letters to mail to delinquent\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nservice cannot be accomplished or certified mail is returned, see Fla.\nStat. \u00a7197.522(2)(a) (2003); Minn.

And a few States require a diligent\ninquiry to find a property owner\u2019s correct address when mailed notice is\nreturned. See Miss. Code Ann. \u00a727\u201343\u20133 (2002); Nev. Rev.

FLOWERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntaxpayers, handed them to the postman, and then watched\nas the departing postman accidentally dropped the letters\ndown a storm drain, one would certainly expect the Com\nmissioner\u2019s office to prepare a new stack of letters and\nsend them again. No one \u201cdesirous of actually informing\u201d\nthe owners would simply shrug his shoulders as the letters\ndisappeared and say \u201cI tried.\u201d Failure to follow up would\nbe unreasonable, despite the fact that the letters were\nreasonably calculated to reach their intended recipients\nwhen delivered to the postman.\n  By the same token, when a letter is returned by the post\noffice, the sender will ordinarily attempt to resend it, if it\nis practicable to do so. See Small v. United States, 136\nF. 3d 1334, 1337 (CADC 1998). This is especially true\nwhen, as here, the subject matter of the letter concerns\nsuch an important and irreversible prospect as the loss of\na house. Although the State may have made a reasonable\ncalculation of how to reach Jones, it had good reason to\nsuspect when the notice was returned that Jones was \u201cno\nbetter off than if the notice had never been sent.\u201d Malone,\nsupra, at 37. Deciding to take no further action is not\nwhat someone \u201cdesirous of actually informing\u201d Jones\nwould do; such a person would take further reasonable\nsteps if any were available.\n  In prior cases, we have required the government to\nconsider unique information about an intended recipient\nregardless of whether a statutory scheme is reasonably\ncalculated to provide notice in the ordinary case. In Rob\ninson v. Hanrahan, we held that notice of forfeiture pro\nceedings sent to a vehicle owner\u2019s home address was in\nadequate when the State knew that the property owner\nwas in prison. 409 U. S., at 40. In Covey v. Town of So\nmers, 351 U. S. 141 (1956), we held that notice of foreclo\nsure by mailing, posting, and publication was inadequate\nwhen town officials knew that the property owner was\nincompetent and without a guardian\u2019s protection. Id., at\n                  Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n146\u2013147.\n  The Commissioner points out that in these cases, the\nState was aware of such information before it calculated\nhow best to provide notice. But it is difficult to explain\nwhy due process would have settled for something less if\nthe government had learned after notice was sent, but\nbefore the taking occurred, that the property owner was in\nprison or was incompetent. Under Robinson and Covey,\nthe government\u2019s knowledge that notice pursuant to the\nnormal procedure was ineffective triggered an obligation\non the government\u2019s part to take additional steps to effect\nnotice. That knowledge was one of the \u201cpracticalities and\npeculiarities of the case,\u201d Mullane, supra, at 314\u2013315, that\nthe Court took into account in determining whether con\nstitutional requirements were met. It should similarly be\ntaken into account in assessing the adequacy of notice in\nthis case. The dissent dismisses the State\u2019s knowledge\nthat its notice was ineffective as \u201clearned long after the\nfact,\u201d post, at 7, n. 5 (opinion of THOMAS, J.), but the notice\nletter was promptly returned to the State two to three\nweeks after it was sent, and the Arkansas statutory re\ngime precludes the State from taking the property for two\nyears while the property owner may exercise his right to\nredeem, see Ark. Code Ann. \u00a726\u201337\u2013301 (Supp. 2005).\n  It is certainly true, as the Commissioner and Solicitor\nGeneral contend, that the failure of notice in a specific\ncase does not establish the inadequacy of the attempted\nnotice; in that sense, the constitutionality of a particular\nprocedure for notice is assessed ex ante, rather than post\nhoc. But if a feature of the State\u2019s chosen procedure is\nthat it promptly provides additional information to the\ngovernment about the effectiveness of notice, it does not\ncontravene the ex ante principle to consider what the\ngovernment does with that information in assessing the\nadequacy of the chosen procedure. After all, the State\nknew ex ante that it would promptly learn whether its\n10                    JONES v. FLOWERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\neffort to effect notice through certified mail had succeeded.\nIt would not be inconsistent with the approach the Court\nhas taken in notice cases to ask, with respect to a proce\ndure under which telephone calls were placed to owners,\nwhat the State did when no one answered. Asking what\nthe State does when a notice letter is returned unclaimed\nis not substantively different.\n   The Commissioner has three further arguments for why\nreasonable followup measures were not required in this\ncase. First, notice was sent to an address that Jones\nprovided and had a legal obligation to keep updated. See\nArk. Code Ann. \u00a726\u201335\u2013705 (1997). Second, \u201cafter failing\nto receive a property tax bill and pay property taxes, a\nproperty holder is on inquiry-notice that his property is\nsubject to governmental taking.\u201d Brief for Respondent\nCommissioner 18\u201319. Third, Jones was obliged to ensure\nthat those in whose hands he left his property would alert\nhim if it was in jeopardy. None of these contentions re\nlieves the State of its constitutional obligation to provide\nadequate notice.\n   The Commissioner does not argue that Jones\u2019 failure to\ncomply with a statutory obligation to keep his address\nupdated forfeits his right to constitutionally sufficient\nnotice, and we agree. Id., at 19; see also Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 16, n. 5 (quoting Mennonite, 462\nU. S., at 799 (\u201c \u2018[A] party\u2019s ability to take steps to safe\nguard its own interests does not relieve the State of its\nconstitutional obligation\u2019 \u201d)). In Robinson, we noted that\nIllinois law required each vehicle owner to register his\naddress with the secretary of state, and that the State\u2019s\nvehicle forfeiture scheme provided for notice by mail to the\naddress listed in the secretary\u2019s records. See 409 U. S., at\n38, n. 1 (citing Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 951\u20442, \u00a73\u2013405 (1971), and\nch. 38, \u00a736\u20131 (1969)). But we found that the State had not\nprovided constitutionally sufficient notice, despite having\nfollowed its reasonably calculated scheme, because it knew\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat Robinson could not be reached at his address of re\ncord. 409 U. S., at 31\u201332. Although Ark. Code Ann. \u00a726\u2013\n35\u2013705 provides strong support for the Commissioner\u2019s\nargument that mailing a certified letter to Jones at 717\nNorth Bryan Street was reasonably calculated to reach\nhim, it does not alter the reasonableness of the Commis\nsioner\u2019s position that he must do nothing more when the\nnotice is promptly returned \u201cunclaimed.\u201d\n   As for the Commissioner\u2019s inquiry notice argument, the\ncommon knowledge that property may become subject to\ngovernment taking when taxes are not paid does not\nexcuse the government from complying with its constitu\ntional obligation of notice before taking private property.\nWe have previously stated the opposite: An interested\nparty\u2019s \u201cknowledge of delinquency in the payment of taxes\nis not equivalent to notice that a tax sale is pending.\u201d\nMennonite, supra, at 800. It is at least as widely known\nthat arrestees have the right to remain silent, and that\nanything they say may be used against them, see\nDickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 443 (2000)\n(\u201cMiranda [v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966),] has become\nembedded in routine police practice to the point where the\nwarnings have become part of our national culture\u201d), but\nthat knowledge does not excuse a police failure to provide\nMiranda warnings. Arkansas affords even a delinquent\ntaxpayer the right to settle accounts with the State and\nredeem his property, so Jones\u2019 failure to pay his taxes in a\ntimely manner cannot by itself excuse inadequate notice.\n   Finally, the Commissioner reminds us of a statement\nfrom Mullane that the State can assume an owner leaves\nhis property in the hands of one who will inform him if his\ninterest is in jeopardy. 339 U. S., at 316. But in this\npassage, Justice Jackson writes of \u201clibel of a ship, attach\nment of a chattel[,] or entry upon real estate in the name\nof law\u201d\u2014such \u201cseiz[ures]\u201d of property, he concluded, \u201cmay\nreasonably be expected to come promptly to the owner\u2019s\n12                   JONES v. FLOWERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nattention.\u201d Ibid. An occupant, however, is not charged\nwith acting as the owner\u2019s agent in all respects, and it is\nquite a leap from Justice Jackson\u2019s examples to conclude\nthat it is an obligation of tenancy to follow up with certi\nfied mail of unknown content addressed to the owner. In\nfact, the State makes it impossible for the occupant to\nlearn why the Commissioner is writing the owner, because\nan occupant cannot call for a certified letter without first\nobtaining the owner\u2019s signature. For all the occupant\nknows, the Commissioner of State Lands might write to\ncertain residents about a variety of matters he finds im\nportant, such as state parks or highway construction; it\nwould by no means be obvious to an occupant observing a\ncertified mail slip from the Commissioner that the owner\nis in danger of losing his property. In any event, there is\nno record evidence that notices of attempted delivery were\nleft at 717 North Bryan Street.\n   Mr. Jones should have been more diligent with respect\nto his property, no question. People must pay their taxes,\nand the government may hold citizens accountable for tax\ndelinquency by taking their property. But before forcing a\ncitizen to satisfy his debt by forfeiting his property, due\nprocess requires the government to provide adequate\nnotice of the impending taking. U. S. Const., Amdt. 14;\nMennonite, supra, at 799.\n                                B\n  In response to the returned form suggesting that Jones\nhad not received notice that he was about to lose his prop\nerty, the State did\u2014nothing. For the reasons stated, we\nconclude the State should have taken additional reason\nable steps to notify Jones, if practicable to do so. The\nquestion remains whether there were any such available\nsteps. While \u201c[i]t is not our responsibility to prescribe the\nform of service that the [government] should adopt,\u201d Gree\nne, 456 U. S., at 455, n. 9, if there were no reasonable addi\n                  Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntional steps the government could have taken upon return of\nthe unclaimed notice letter, it cannot be faulted for doing\nnothing.\n   We think there were several reasonable steps the State\ncould have taken. What steps are reasonable in response\nto new information depends upon what the new informa\ntion reveals. The return of the certified letter marked\n\u201cunclaimed\u201d meant either that Jones still lived at 717\nNorth Bryan Street, but was not home when the postman\ncalled and did not retrieve the letter at the post office, or\nthat Jones no longer resided at that address. One reason\nable step primarily addressed to the former possibility\nwould be for the State to resend the notice by regular mail,\nso that a signature was not required. The Commissioner\nsays that use of certified mail makes actual notice more\nlikely, because requiring the recipient\u2019s signature protects\nagainst misdelivery. But that is only true, of course, when\nsomeone is home to sign for the letter, or to inform the\nmail carrier that he has arrived at the wrong address.\nOtherwise, \u201c[c]ertified mail is dispatched and handled in\ntransit as ordinary mail,\u201d United States Postal Service,\nDomestic Mail Manual \u00a7503.3.2.1 (Mar. 16, 2006), and the\nuse of certified mail might make actual notice less likely in\nsome cases\u2014the letter cannot be left like regular mail to\nbe examined at the end of the day, and it can only be\nretrieved from the post office for a specified period of time.\nFollowing up with regular mail might also increase the\nchances of actual notice to Jones if\u2014as it turned out\u2014he\nhad moved. Even occupants who ignored certified mail\nnotice slips addressed to the owner (if any had been left)\nmight scrawl the owner\u2019s new address on the notice packet\nand leave it for the postman to retrieve, or notify Jones\ndirectly.\n   Other reasonable followup measures, directed at the\npossibility that Jones had moved as well as that he had\nsimply not retrieved the certified letter, would have been\n14                   JONES v. FLOWERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto post notice on the front door, or to address otherwise\nundeliverable mail to \u201coccupant.\u201d Most States that explic\nitly outline additional procedures in their tax sale statutes\nrequire just such steps. See n. 2, supra. Either approach\nwould increase the likelihood that the owner would be\nnotified that he was about to lose his property, given the\nfailure of a letter deliverable only to the owner in person.\nThat is clear in the case of an owner who still resided at\nthe premises. It is also true in the case of an owner who\nhas moved: Occupants who might disregard a certified\nmail slip not addressed to them are less likely to ignore\nposted notice, and a letter addressed to them (even as\n\u201coccupant\u201d) might be opened and read. In either case,\nthere is a significant chance the occupants will alert the\nowner, if only because a change in ownership could well\naffect their own occupancy. In fact, Jones first learned of\nthe State\u2019s effort to sell his house when he was alerted by\none of the occupants\u2014his daughter\u2014after she was served\nwith an unlawful detainer notice.\n   Jones believes that the Commissioner should have\nsearched for his new address in the Little Rock phonebook\nand other government records such as income tax rolls.\nWe do not believe the government was required to go this\nfar. As the Commissioner points out, the return of Jones\u2019\nmail marked \u201cunclaimed\u201d did not necessarily mean that\n717 North Bryan Street was an incorrect address; it\nmerely informed the Commissioner that no one appeared\nto sign for the mail before the designated date on which it\nwould be returned to the sender. An open-ended search\nfor a new address\u2014especially when the State obligates the\ntaxpayer to keep his address updated with the tax collec\ntor, see Ark. Code Ann. \u00a726\u201335\u2013705 (1997)\u2014imposes\nburdens on the State significantly greater than the several\nrelatively easy options outlined above.\n   The Commissioner complains about the burden of even\nthose additional steps, but his argument is belied by Ar\n                 Cite as: 547 U.

The Commis\nsioner has offered no estimate of how many notice letters\nare returned, and no facts to support the dissent\u2019s asser\ntion that the Commissioner must now physically locate\n\u201ctens of thousands of properties every year.\u201d Post, at 10.\nCiting our decision in Greene v. Lindsey, the Solicitor\nGeneral adds that posted notice could be taken down by\nchildren or vandals. But in Greene, we noted that outside\nthe specific facts of that case, posting notice on real prop\nerty is \u201ca singularly appropriate and effective way of\nensuring that a person . . . is actually apprised of proceed\nings against him.\u201d 456 U. S., at 452\u2013453. Successfully\nproviding notice is often the most efficient way to collect\nunpaid taxes, see Mennonite, 462 U. S., at 800, n. 5 (more\neffective notice may ease burden on State if recipient\narranges to pay delinquent taxes prior to tax sale); Tr. of\nOral Arg. 24 (85 percent of tax delinquent properties in\nArkansas are redeemed upon notice of delinquency), but\nrather than taking relatively easy additional steps to\neffect notice, the State undertook the burden and expense\nof purchasing a newspaper advertisement, conducting an\nauction, and then negotiating a private sale of the prop\nerty to Flowers.\n   The Solicitor General argues that requiring further\neffort when the government learns that notice was not\ndelivered will cause the government to favor modes of\nproviding notice that do not generate additional informa\ntion\u2014for example, starting (and stopping) with regular\nmail instead of certified mail. We find this unlikely, as we\nhave no doubt that the government repeatedly finds itself\nbeing asked to prove that notice was sent and received.\nUsing certified mail provides the State with documenta\n16                  JONES v. FLOWERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion of personal delivery and protection against false\nclaims that notice was never received. That added secu\nrity, however, comes at a price\u2014the State also learns\nwhen notice has not been received. We conclude that,\nunder the circumstances presented, the State cannot\nsimply ignore that information in proceeding to take and\nsell the owner\u2019s property\u2014any more than it could ignore\nthe information that the owner in Robinson was in jail, or\nthat the owner in Covey was incompetent.\n   Though the Commissioner argues that followup meas\nures are not constitutionally required, he reminds us that\nthe State did make some attempt to follow up with Jones\nby publishing notice in the newspaper a few weeks before\nthe public sale. Several decades ago, this Court observed\nthat \u201c[c]hance alone\u201d brings a person\u2019s attention to \u201can\nadvertisement in small type inserted in the back pages of\na newspaper,\u201d Mullane, 339 U.

Mindful of the\ndissent\u2019s concerns, we conclude, at the end of the day, that\nsomeone who actually wanted to alert Jones that he was\nin danger of losing his house would do more when the\nattempted notice letter was returned unclaimed, and there\nwas more that reasonably could be done.\n  As noted, \u201c[i]t is not our responsibility to prescribe the\nform of service that the [government] should adopt.\u201d\nGreene, supra, at 455, n. 9. In prior cases finding notice\ninadequate, we have not attempted to redraft the State\u2019s\nnotice statute. See, e.g., Tulsa Professional, 485 U. S., at\n490\u2013491; Robinson, 409 U.

The State can de\ntermine how to proceed in response to our conclusion that\nnotice was inadequate here, and the States have taken a\nvariety of approaches to the present question. See n. 2,\nsupra.

The same cannot be said for the State\u2019s\nefforts to ensure that its citizens receive proper notice\nbefore the State takes action against them. In this case,\nthe State is exerting extraordinary power against a prop\nerty owner\u2014taking and selling a house he owns.

After peti\ntioner failed to respond, the State also published notice of\nthe delinquency and public sale in an Arkansas newspaper.\nSoon after respondent Linda K. Flowers submitted a pur\nchase offer to the State, it sent petitioner a second letter by\ncertified mail explaining that the sale would proceed if the\ndelinquent taxes and penalties were not paid.\n   Petitioner argues that the State violated his rights\nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend\nment because, in his view, the State failed to take suffi\ncient steps to contact him before selling his property to\nFlowers. Petitioner contends that once the State became\naware that he had not claimed the certified mail, it was\nconstitutionally obligated to employ additional methods to\nlocate him.\n   Adopting petitioner\u2019s arguments, the Court holds today\nthat \u201cwhen mailed notice of a tax sale is returned un\n2                    JONES v.

Balancing a State\u2019s interest in efficiently\nmanaging its administrative system and an individual\u2019s\ninterest in adequate notice, this Court has held that a State\nmust provide \u201cnotice reasonably calculated, under all the\ncircumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency\nof the action.\u201d Id., at 313\u2013314.

The State mailed a\nnotice by certified letter to the address provided by peti\ntioner. The certified letter was returned to the State\nmarked \u201cunclaimed\u201d after three attempts to deliver it. The\nState then published a notice of public sale containing\nredemption information in the Arkansas Democrat Gazette\nnewspaper. After Flowers submitted a purchase offer, the\nState sent yet another certified letter to petitioner at his\nrecord address. That letter, too, was returned to the State\nmarked \u201cunclaimed\u201d after three delivery attempts.1\n   Arkansas\u2019 attempts to contact petitioner by certified\nmail at his \u201crecord address,\u201d without more, satisfy due\nprocess.

FLOWERS\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nwhich payments of property taxes have been delinquent\u201d\n(emphasis added)). Because the notices were sent to the\naddress provided by petitioner himself, the State had an\nespecially sound basis for determining that notice would\nreach him. Moreover, Arkansas exceeded the constitu\ntional minimum by additionally publishing notice in a\nlocal newspaper.2 See Mullane, supra, at 318. Due proc\ness requires nothing more\u2014and certainly not here, where\npetitioner had a statutory duty to pay his taxes and to\nreport any change of address to the state taxing authority.\nSee Ark. Code Ann. \u00a726\u201335\u2013705 (1997).\n   My conclusion that Arkansas\u2019 notice methods satisfy due\nprocess is reinforced by the well-established presumption\nthat individuals, especially those owning property, act in\ntheir own interest. Recognizing that \u201c \u2018[i]t is the part of\ncommon prudence for all those who have any interest in [a\nthing], to guard that interest by persons who are in a\nsituation to protect it,\u2019 \u201d Mullane, supra, at 316 (quoting\nThe Mary, 9 Cranch 126, 144 (1815)), this Court has con\ncluded that \u201c[t]he ways of an owner with tangible property\nare such that he usually arranges means to learn of any\ndirect attack upon his possessory or proprietary rights.\u201d\nMullane, 339 U. S., at 316. Consistent with this observa\ntion, Arkansas was free to \u201cindulge the assumption\u201d that\npetitioner had either provided the State taxing authority\nwith a correct and up-to-date mailing address\u2014as re\nquired by state law\u2014\u201cor that he . . . left some caretaker\nunder a duty to let him know that [his property was] being\njeopardized.\u201d3 Ibid.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 The\n        Court found inadequate the State\u2019s attempt at notice by publi\ncation, as if that were the State\u2019s sole method for effectuating notice,\nsee ante, at 16. But the State plainly used it here as a secondary\nmethod of notice.\n  3 The issue is not, as the Court maintains, whether the current occu\n\npant is \u201ccharged with acting as the owner\u2019s agent.\u201d Ante, at 12.\nRather, the issue is whether petitioner discharged his own duty to\nguard his interests.\n                  Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)             5\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court does not conclude that certified mail is inher\nently insufficient as a means of notice, but rather that \u201cthe\ngovernment\u2019s knowledge that notice pursuant to the nor\nmal procedure was ineffective triggered an obligation on\nthe government\u2019s part to take additional steps to effect\nnotice.\u201d Ante, at 9. I disagree.\n   First, whether a method of notice is reasonably calcu\nlated to notify the interested party is determined ex ante,\ni.e., from the viewpoint of the government agency at the\ntime its notice is sent. This follows from Mullane, where\nthis Court rested its analysis on the information the\nsender had \u201cat hand\u201d when its notice was sent. 339 U. S.,\nat 318. Relatedly, we have refused to evaluate the rea\nsonableness of a particular method of notice by comparing\nit to alternative methods that are identified after the fact.\nSee Dusenbery, 534 U. S., at 171\u2013172. Today the Court\nappears to abandon both of these practices. Its rejection of\nArkansas\u2019 selected method of notice\u2014a method this Court\nhas repeatedly concluded is constitutionally sufficient\u2014is\nbased upon information that was unavailable when notice\nwas sent. Indeed, the Court\u2019s proposed notice methods\u2014\nregular mail, posting and addressing mail to \u201coccupant,\u201d\nante, at 12\u201314\u2014are entirely the product of post hoc con\nsiderations, including the discovery that members of\npetitioner\u2019s family continued to live in the house. Simi\nlarly, the Court\u2019s observation that \u201c[t]he Commissioner[\u2019s]\ncomplain[t] about the burden of . . . additional steps . . . is\nbelied by Arkansas\u2019 current requirement that notice to\nhomestead-owners be accomplished by personal service if\ncertified mail is returned,\u201d ante, at 14\u201315, is contrary to\nDusenbery\u2019s \u201cconclusion that the Government ought not be\npenalized and told to \u2018try harder\u2019 . . . simply because [it]\nhas since upgraded its policies,\u201d 534 U. S., at 172 (citation\nomitted).\n   Second, implicit in our holding that due process does not\nrequire \u201cactual notice,\u201d see id., at 169\u2013170, is that when\n6                   JONES v. FLOWERS\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe \u201cgovernment becomes aware . . . that its attempt at\nnotice has failed,\u201d ante, at 5, it is not required to take\nadditional steps to ensure that notice has been received.\nPetitioner\u2019s challenge to Arkansas\u2019 notice methods, and\nthe Court\u2019s acceptance of it, is little more than a thinly\nveiled attack on Dusenbery. Under the majority\u2019s logic,\neach time a doubt is raised with respect to whether notice\nhas reached an interested party, the State will have to\nconsider additional means better calculated to achieve\nnotice. Because this rule turns on speculative, newly\nacquired information, it has no natural end point, and, in\neffect, requires the States to achieve something close to\nactual notice. The majority\u2019s new rule is contrary to\nDusenbery and a significant departure from Mullane.\n   The only circumstances in which this Court has found\nnotice by mail and publication inadequate under the Due\nProcess Clause involve situations where the state or local\ngovernment knew at the outset that its notice efforts were\ndestined to fail and knew how to rectify the problem prior\nto sending notice. See Robinson v. Hanrahan, 409 U. S.\n38, 39 (1972) (per curiam) (intended recipient known to be\nin jail); Covey v. Town of Somers, 351 U. S. 141, 145 (1956)\n(intended recipient known to be incompetent and without\na guardian).\n   In Robinson, the State, having arrested petitioner and\ndetained him in county jail, immediately instituted forfei\nture proceedings against his automobile and mailed notice\nof those proceedings to his residential address. 409 U.

Robinson, who was incarcerated in the county jail\nduring the entirety of the forfeiture proceedings, did not\nreceive notice of the proceedings until after he was re\nleased and the forfeiture order had been entered. Id., at\n38\u201339. Because the State knew beforehand that Robinson\nwas not at, and had no access to, the address to which it\nsent the notice, this Court held that the State\u2019s efforts\nwere not \u201creasonably calculated\u201d to notify him of the pend\n                    Cite as: 547 U.

Similarly, in Covey, the Court\nconcluded that the methods of notice used by the town\u2014\nmailing, posting, and publishing\u2014were not reasonably\ncalculated to inform Covey of proceedings adverse to her\nproperty interests because local officials knew prior to\nsending notice that she was \u201cwithout mental capacity to\nhandle her affairs\u201d and unable to comprehend the mean\ning of the notices. 351 U. S., at 144, 146.\n   By contrast, Arkansas did not know at the time it sent\nnotice to petitioner that its method would fail; and Ar\nkansas did not know that petitioner no longer lived at the\nrecord address simply because letters were returned\n\u201cunclaimed.\u201d Pet. for Cert. 3. \u201c[U]nclaimed\u201d does not\nnecessarily mean that an address is no longer correct; it\nmay indicate that an intended recipient has simply failed\nor refused to claim mail. See United States Postal Ser\nvice, Domestic Mail Manual (DMM), \u00a7507, Exh. 1.4.1,\nhttp://pe.usps.gov/text/dmm300/507.htm.4 Given that the\nState had been using the address provided by petitioner\nand that petitioner had a legal duty to maintain a cur\nrent mailing address with the state taxing authority,\nreturn of the mail as \u201cunclaimed\u201d did not arm Arkansas\nwith the type of specific knowledge that the governments\nhad at hand in Robinson and Covey. Cf. ante, at 13. The\nState cannot be charged to correct a problem of peti\ntioner\u2019s own creation and of which it was not aware.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The Postal Service uses \u201cMoved, Left No Address\u201d to indicate that\n\nthe \u201c[A]ddressee moved and filed no change-of-address order,\u201d and \u201cNot\nDeliverable as Addressed\u2014Unable to Forward\u201d to indicate that the\nmail is \u201cundeliverable at address given; no change-of-address order on\nfile; forwarding order expired.\u201d DMM \u00a7507, Exh. 1.4.1.\n   5 The Court\u2019s \u201cstorm drain\u201d hypothetical, ante, at 7\u20138, presents the\n\nharder question of when notice is sent\u2014at the precise moment the\nCommissioner places the mail in the postal carrier\u2019s hand or the split\nsecond later when he observes the departing carrier drop the mail down\nthe storm drain. That more difficult question is not before us in this\ncase because Arkansas learned long after the fact that its attempts had\nbeen unsuccessful.\n8                   JONES v. FLOWERS\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nEven if the State had divined that petitioner was no\nlonger at the record address, its publication of notice in a\nlocal newspaper would have sufficed because Mullane\nauthorizes the use of publication when the record address\nis unknown. See 339 U. S., at 316 (\u201c[P]ublication tradi\ntionally has been acceptable as notification supplemental\nto other action which in itself may reasonably be ex\npected to convey a warning\u201d).\n                              II\n   The Court\u2019s proposed methods, aside from being consti\ntutionally unnecessary, are also burdensome, impractical,\nand no more likely to effect notice than the methods actu\nally employed by the State.\n   In Arkansas, approximately 18,000 parcels of delinquent\nreal estate are certified annually. Tsann Kuen Enterprises\nCo. v. Campbell, 335 Ark. 110, 119\u2013120, 129 S. W. 3d 822,\n828 (2003). Under the Court\u2019s rule, the State will bear the\nburden of locating thousands of delinquent property own\ners. These administrative burdens are not compelled by\nthe Due Process Clause. See Mullane, supra, at 313\u2013314;\nTulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc., 485 U. S., at\n489\u2013490 (stating that constitutionally sufficient notice\n\u201cneed not be inefficient or burdensome\u201d). Here, Arkansas\nhas determined that its law requiring property owners to\nmaintain a current address with the state taxing author\nity, in conjunction with its authorization to send property\nnotices to the record address, is an efficient and fair way\nto administer its tax collection system. The Court\u2019s deci\nsion today forecloses such a reasonable system and bur\ndens the State with inefficiencies caused by delinquent\ntaxpayers.\n   Moreover, the Court\u2019s proposed methods are no more\nreasonably calculated to achieve notice than the methods\nemployed by the State here. Regular mail is hardly fool\nproof; indeed, it is arguably less effective than certified\nmail. Certified mail is tracked, delivery attempts are\n                     Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)                     9\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nrecorded, actual delivery is logged, and notices are posted\nto alert someone at the residence that certified mail is\nbeing held at a local post office. By creating a record,\nthese features give parties grounds for defending or chal\nlenging notice. By contrast, regular mail is untraceable;\nthere is no record of either delivery or receipt. Had the\nState used regular mail, petitioner would presumably\nargue that it should have sent notice by certified mail\nbecause it creates a paper trail.6\n    The Court itself recognizes the deficiencies of its pro\nposed methods. It acknowledges that \u201c[f]ollowing up with\nregular mail might . . . increase the chances of actual\nnotice\u201d; \u201coccupants who ignored certified mail notice slips\n. . . might scrawl the owner\u2019s new address on the notice\npacket,\u201d ante, at 12; and \u201ca letter addressed to [occupant]\nmight be opened and read,\u201d ante, at 14 (emphasis added).\nNevertheless, the Court justifies its redrafting of Arkansas\u2019\nnotice statute on the ground that \u201c[its] approach[es] would\nincrease the likelihood that the owner would be notified\nthat he was about to lose his property . . . .\u201d Ibid. That,\nhowever, is not the test; indeed, we rejected such reasoning\nin Dusenbery. See 534 U. S., at 171 (rejecting the argu\nment that \u201cthe FBI\u2019s notice was constitutionally flawed\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 Interestingly, the Court stops short of saddling the State with the\n\nother steps that petitioner argues a State should take any time the\ninterested party fails to claim letters mailed to his record address, see\nante, at 14, namely searching state tax records, the phone-book, the\nInternet, department of motor vehicle records, or voting rolls, contacting\nhis employer, or employing debt collectors. Here, the Court reasons that\nbecause of the context\u2014the fact that the letter was returned merely\n\u201cunclaimed\u201d and petitioner had a duty to maintain a current address\u2014the\nState is not required to go as far as petitioner urges. Ibid. Though the\nmethods proposed by petitioner are severely flawed (for instance, the\ncommonality of his surname \u201cJones\u201d calls into question the fruitfulness of\nInternet and phone-book searches), there is no principled basis for the\nCourt\u2019s conclusion that petitioner\u2019s other proposed methods would \u201cim\npos[e] burdens on the State significantly greater than the several rela\ntively easy options outlined [by the Court].\u201d Ibid.\n10                   JONES v.

The State\u2019s records are organized by\nlegal description, not address, which makes the prospect of\nphysically locating tens of thousands of properties every\nyear, and posting notice on each, impractical. See Tsann\nKuen Enterprises Co., supra, at 119\u2013120, 129 S. W. 3d, at\n828. Also, this Court has previously concluded that post\ning is an inherently unreliable method of notice. See\nGreene v. Lindsey, 456 U. S. 444, 453\u2013454 (1982).\n   Similarly, addressing the mail to \u201coccupant,\u201d see ante, at\n13, is no more reasonably calculated to reach petitioner. It\nis sheer speculation to assume, as the Court does, that\nalthough \u201c[o]ccupants . . . might disregard a certified mail\nslip . . . , a letter addressed to them (even as \u2018occupant\u2019)\nmight be opened and read.\u201d Ante, at 14.

Nor is the self-created\nconundrum in which petitioner finds himself a legitimate\nground for imposing additional constitutional obligations on\nthe State. The State\u2019s attempts to notify petitioner by\ncertified mail at the address that he provided and, addi\ntionally, by publishing notice in a local newspaper satisfy\ndue process. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of\nthe Arkansas Supreme Court.\n",

S. 306, 313 (1950). We granted certiorari to determine whether, when notice of a tax sale is mailed to the owner and returned undelivered, the government must take additional reasonable steps to provide notice before taking the owner's property.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In 1967, petitioner Gary Jones purchased a house at 717 North Bryan Street in Little Rock, Arkansas. He lived in the house with his wife until they separated in 1993. Jones then moved into an apartment in Little Rock, and his wife continued to live in the North Bryan Street house. Jones paid his mortgage each month for 30 years, and the mortgage company paid Jones' property taxes. After Jones paid off his mortgage in 1997, the property taxes went unpaid, and the property was certified as delinquent.</p>\n<p>In April 2000, respondent Mark Wilcox, the Commissioner of State Lands (Commissioner), attempted to notify Jones of his tax delinquency, and his right to redeem the property, by mailing a certified letter to Jones at the North Bryan Street address. See Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 26-37-301 (1997). The packet of information stated that unless Jones redeemed the property, it would be subject to public sale two years later on April 17, 2002. See <i>ibid.</i> Nobody was home to sign for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*224</span> the letter, and nobody appeared at the post office to retrieve the letter within the next 15 days. The post office returned the unopened packet to the Commissioner marked \"`unclaimed.'\" Pet. for Cert. 3.</p>\n<p>Two years later, and just a few weeks before the public sale, the Commissioner published a notice of public sale in the Arkansas Democrat Gazette. No bids were submitted, which permitted the State to negotiate a private sale of the property. See \u00a7 26-37-202(b). Several months later, respondent Linda Flowers submitted a purchase offer. The Commissioner mailed another certified letter to Jones at the North Bryan Street address, attempting to notify him that his house would be sold to Flowers if he did not pay his taxes. Like the first letter, the second was also returned to the Commissioner marked \"unclaimed.\" Pet. for Cert. 3. Flowers purchased the house, which the parties stipulated in the trial court had a fair market value of $80,000, for $21,042.15. Record 224. Immediately after the 30-day period for postsale redemption passed, see \u00a7 26-37-202(e), Flowers had an unlawful detainer notice delivered to the property. The notice was served on Jones' daughter, who contacted Jones and notified him of the tax sale. <i>Id.,</i> at 11 (Exh. B).</p>\n<p>Jones filed a lawsuit in Arkansas state court against the Commissioner and Flowers, alleging that the Commissioner's failure to provide notice of the tax sale and of Jones' right to redeem resulted in the taking of his property without due process. The Commissioner and Flowers moved for summary judgment on the ground that the two unclaimed letters sent by the Commissioner were a constitutionally adequate attempt at notice, and Jones filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner and Flowers. App. to Pet. for Cert. 12a-13a. It concluded that the Arkansas tax sale statute, which set forth the notice procedure followed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*225</span> by the Commissioner, complied with constitutional due process requirements.</p>\n<p>Jones appealed, and the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's judgment. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1655367\"><a href=\"/opinion/1655367/jones-v-flowers/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ark.</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span>, 198 S. W. 3d 520 (2004). The court noted our precedent stating that due process does not require actual notice, see <i>Dusenbery</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 534 U. S. 161, 170 (2002), and it held that attempting to provide notice by certified mail satisfied due process in the circumstances presented, 359 Ark., at 453-454, 198 S. W. 3d, at 526-527.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 545 U. S. 1165 (2005), to resolve a conflict among the Circuits and State Supreme Courts concerning whether the Due Process Clause requires the government to take additional reasonable steps to notify a property owner when notice of a tax sale is returned undelivered. Compare, <i>e. g., </i><i>Akey</i> v. <i>Clinton County,</i> 375 F. 3d 231, 236 (CA2 2004) (\"In light of the notice's return, the County was required to use `reasonably diligent efforts' to ascertain Akey's correct address\"), and <i>Kennedy</i> v. <i>Mossafa,</i> 100 N. Y. 2d 1, 9, 789 N. E. 2d 607, 611 (2003) (\"[W]e reject the view that the enforcing officer's obligation is always satisfied by sending the notice to the address listed in the tax roll, even where the notice is returned as undeliverable\"), with <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Cliffs on the Bay Condominium Assn.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2227491\"><a href=\"/opinion/2227491/smith-v-cliffs-on-the-bay-condominium-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span>, 429, 617 N.

We hold that when mailed notice of a tax sale is returned unclaimed, the State must take additional reasonable steps to attempt to provide notice to the property owner before selling his property, if it is practicable to do so. Under the circumstances presented here, additional reasonable steps were available to the State. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Arkansas Supreme Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*226</span> II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Due process does not require that a property owner receive actual notice before the government may take his property. <i>Dusenbery, supra,</i> at 170. Rather, we have stated that due process requires the government to provide \"notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\" <i>Mullane,</i> 339 U. S., at 314. The Commissioner argues that once the State provided notice reasonably calculated to apprise Jones of the impending tax sale by mailing him a certified letter, due process was satisfied. The Arkansas statutory scheme is reasonably calculated to provide notice, the Commissioner continues, because it provides for notice by certified mail to an address that the property owner is responsible for keeping up to date. See Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 26-35-705 (1997). The Commissioner notes this Court's ample precedent condoning notice by mail, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Dusenbery, supra,</i> at 169; <i>Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc.</i> v. <i>Pope,</i> 485 U. S. 478, 490 (1988); <i>Mennonite Bd. of Missions</i> v. <i>Adams,</i> 462 U. S. 791, 798 (1983); <i>Mullane, supra,</i> at 318-319, and adds that the Arkansas scheme exceeds constitutional requirements by requiring the Commissioner to use certified mail. Brief for Respondent Commissioner 14-15.</p>\n<p>It is true that this Court has deemed notice constitutionally sufficient if it was reasonably calculated to reach the intended recipient when sent. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Dusenbery, supra,</i> at 168-169; <i>Mullane,</i> 339 U. S., at 314. In each of these cases, the government attempted to provide notice and heard nothing back indicating that anything had gone awry, and we stated that \"[t]he reasonableness and hence the constitutional validity of [the] chosen method may be defended on the ground that it is in itself reasonably certain to inform those affected.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 315; see also <i>Dusenbery, supra,</i> at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*227</span> 170. But we have never addressed whether due process entails further responsibility when the government becomes aware prior to the taking that its attempt at notice has failed. That is a new wrinkle, and we have explained that the \"notice required will vary with circumstances and conditions.\" <i>Walker</i> v. <i>City of Hutchinson,</i> 352 U. S. 112, 115 (1956). The question presented is whether such knowledge on the government's part is a \"circumstance and condition\" that varies the \"notice required.\"</p>\n<p>The Courts of Appeals and State Supreme Courts have addressed this question on frequent occasions, and most have decided that when the government learns its attempt at notice has failed, due process requires the government to do something more before real property may be sold in a tax sale.<sup>[1]</sup> See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Plemons</i> v. <i>Gale,</i> 396 F. 3d 569, 576 (CA4 2005); <i>Akey, supra,</i> at 236; <i>Hamilton</i> v. <i>Renewed Hope, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1310932\"><a href=\"/opinion/1310932/hamilton-v-renewed-hope-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ga.</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></a></span>, 468, 589 S.

Many States already require in their statutes that the government do more than simply mail notice to delinquent owners, either at the outset or as a followup measure if initial mailed notice is ineffective.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*229</span> In <i>Mullane,</i> we stated that \"when notice is a person's due . . . [t]he means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it,\" 339 U. S., at 315, and that assessing the adequacy of a particular form of notice requires balancing the \"interest of the State\" against \"the individual interest sought to be protected by the Fourteenth Amendment,\" <i>id.,</i> at 314. Our leading cases on notice have evaluated the adequacy of notice given to beneficiaries of a common trust fund, <i>Mullane, supra</i><i>;</i> a mortgagee, <i>Mennonite,</i> 462 U. S. 791; owners of seized cash and automobiles, <i>Dusenbery,</i> 534 U. S. 161; <i>Robinson</i> v. <i>Hanrahan,</i> 409 U. S. 38 (1972) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>;</i> creditors of an estate, <i>Tulsa Professional,</i> 485 U. S. 478; and tenants living in public housing, <i>Greene</i> v. <i>Lindsey,</i> 456 U. S. 444 (1982). In this case, we evaluate the adequacy of notice prior to the State extinguishing a property owner's interest in a home.</p>\n<p>We do not think that a person who actually desired to inform a real property owner of an impending tax sale of a house he owns would do nothing when a certified letter sent to the owner is returned unclaimed. If the Commissioner prepared a stack of letters to mail to delinquent taxpayers, handed them to the postman, and then watched as the departing postman accidentally dropped the letters down a storm drain, one would certainly expect the Commissioner's office to prepare a new stack of letters and send them again. No one \"desirous of actually informing\" the owners would simply shrug his shoulders as the letters disappeared and say \"I tried.\" Failure to follow up would be unreasonable, despite the fact that the letters were reasonably calculated to reach their intended recipients when delivered to the postman.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*230</span> By the same token, when a letter is returned by the post office, the sender will ordinarily attempt to resend it, if it is practicable to do so. See <i>Small</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 136 F. 3d 1334, 1337 (CADC 1998). This is especially true when, as here, the subject matter of the letter concerns such an important and irreversible prospect as the loss of a house. Although the State may have made a reasonable calculation of how to reach Jones, it had good reason to suspect when the notice was returned that Jones was \"no better off than if the notice had never been sent.\" <i>Malone,</i> 614 A. 2d, at 37. Deciding to take no further action is not what someone \"desirous of actually informing\" Jones would do; such a person would take further reasonable steps if any were available.</p>\n<p>In prior cases, we have required the government to consider unique information about an intended recipient regardless of whether a statutory scheme is reasonably calculated to provide notice in the ordinary case. In <i>Robinson</i> v. <i>Hanrahan</i><i>,</i> we held that notice of forfeiture proceedings sent to a vehicle owner's home address was inadequate when the State knew that the property owner was in prison. 409 U. S., at 40. In <i>Covey</i> v. <i>Town of Somers,</i> 351 U. S. 141 (1956), we held that notice of foreclosure by mailing, posting, and publication was inadequate when town officials knew that the property owner was incompetent and without a guardian's protection. <i>Id.,</i> at 146-147.</p>\n<p>The Commissioner points out that in these cases, the State was aware of such information <i>before</i> it calculated how best to provide notice. But it is difficult to explain why due process would have settled for something less if the government had learned after notice was sent, but before the taking occurred, that the property owner was in prison or was incompetent. Under <i>Robinson</i> and <i>Covey,</i> the government's knowledge that notice pursuant to the normal procedure was ineffective triggered an obligation on the government's part to take additional steps to effect notice. That knowledge was one of the \"practicalities and peculiarities of the case,\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*231</span> <i>Mullane, supra,</i> at 314-315, that the Court took into account in determining whether constitutional requirements were met. It should similarly be taken into account in assessing the adequacy of notice in this case. The dissent dismisses the State's knowledge that its notice was ineffective as \"learned long after the fact,\" <i>post,</i> at 246, n. 5 (opinion of Thomas, J.), but the notice letter was promptly returned to the State two to three weeks after it was sent, and the Arkansas statutory regime precludes the State from taking the property for two <i>years</i> while the property owner may exercise his right to redeem, see Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 26-37-301 (Supp. 2005).</p>\n<p>It is certainly true, as the Commissioner and Solicitor General contend, that the failure of notice in a specific case does not establish the inadequacy of the attempted notice; in that sense, the constitutionality of a particular procedure for notice is assessed <i>ex ante,</i> rather than <i>post hoc.</i> But if a feature of the State's chosen procedure is that it promptly provides additional information to the government about the effectiveness of notice, it does not contravene the <i>ex ante</i> principle to consider what the government does with that information in assessing the adequacy of the chosen procedure. After all, the State knew <i>ex ante</i> that it would promptly learn whether its effort to effect notice through certified mail had succeeded. It would not be inconsistent with the approach the Court has taken in notice cases to ask, with respect to a procedure under which telephone calls were placed to owners, what the State did when no one answered. Asking what the State does when a notice letter is returned unclaimed is not substantively different.</p>\n<p>The Commissioner has three further arguments for why reasonable followup measures were not required in this case. First, notice was sent to an address that Jones provided and had a legal obligation to keep updated. See Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 26-35-705 (1997). Second, \"after failing to receive a property tax bill and pay property taxes, a property holder is on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*232</span> inquiry-notice that his property is subject to governmental taking.\" Brief for Respondent Commissioner 18-19. Third, Jones was obliged to ensure that those in whose hands he left his property would alert him if it was in jeopardy. None of these contentions relieves the State of its constitutional obligation to provide adequate notice.</p>\n<p>The Commissioner does not argue that Jones' failure to comply with a statutory obligation to keep his address updated forfeits his right to constitutionally sufficient notice, and we agree. <i>Id.,</i> at 19; see also Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 16, n. 5 (\"`[A] party's ability to take steps to safeguard its own interests does not relieve the State of its constitutional obligation'\" (quoting <i>Mennonite,</i> 462 U. S., at 799)). In <i>Robinson,</i> we noted that Illinois law required each vehicle owner to register his address with the secretary of state, and that the State's vehicle forfeiture scheme provided for notice by mail to the address listed in the secretary's records. See 409 U. S., at 38, n. 1 (citing Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 95\u00bd, \u00a7 3-405 (1971), and ch. 38, \u00a7 36-1 (1969)). But we found that the State had not provided constitutionally sufficient notice, despite having followed its reasonably calculated scheme, because it knew that Robinson could not be reached at his address of record. 409 U. S., at 39-40. Although Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 26-35-705 provides strong support for the Commissioner's argument that mailing a certified letter to Jones at 717 North Bryan Street was reasonably calculated to reach him, it does not alter the reasonableness of the Commissioner's position that he must do nothing more when the notice is promptly returned \"unclaimed.\"</p>\n<p>As for the Commissioner's inquiry notice argument, the common knowledge that property may become subject to government taking when taxes are not paid does not excuse the government from complying with its constitutional obligation of notice before taking private property. We have previously stated the opposite: An interested party's \"knowledge of delinquency in the payment of taxes is not equivalent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*233</span> to notice that a tax sale is pending.\" <i>Mennonite, supra,</i> at 800. It is at least as widely known that arrestees have the right to remain silent, and that anything they say may be used against them, see <i>Dickerson</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 530 U. S. 428, 443 (2000) (\"<i>Miranda</i> [v. <i>Arizona,</i> 384 U. S. 436 (1966),] has become embedded in routine police practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our national culture\"), but that knowledge does not excuse a police failure to provide <i>Miranda</i> warnings. Arkansas affords even a delinquent taxpayer the right to settle accounts with the State and redeem his property, so Jones' failure to pay his taxes in a timely manner cannot by itself excuse inadequate notice.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Commissioner reminds us of a statement from <i>Mullane</i> that the State can assume an owner leaves his property in the hands of one who will inform him if his interest is in jeopardy. 339 U. S., at 316. But in this passage, Justice Jackson writes of \"libel of a ship, attachment of a chattel[,] or entry upon real estate in the name of law\"\u0097such \"seiz[ures]\" of property, he concluded, \"may reasonably be expected to come promptly to the owner's attention.\" <i>Ibid.</i> An occupant, however, is not charged with acting as the owner's agent in all respects, and it is quite a leap from Justice Jackson's examples to conclude that it is an obligation of tenancy to follow up with certified mail of unknown content addressed to the owner. In fact, the State makes it impossible for the occupant to learn why the Commissioner is writing the owner, because an occupant cannot call for a certified letter without first obtaining the owner's signature. For all the occupant knows, the Commissioner of State Lands might write to certain residents about a variety of matters he finds important, such as state parks or highway construction; it would by no means be obvious to an occupant observing a certified mail slip from the Commissioner that the owner is in danger of losing his property. In any event, there is no record evidence that notices of attempted delivery were left at 717 North Bryan Street.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*234</span> Jones should have been more diligent with respect to his property, no question. People must pay their taxes, and the government may hold citizens accountable for tax delinquency by taking their property. But before forcing a citizen to satisfy his debt by forfeiting his property, due process requires the government to provide adequate notice of the impending taking. U. S. Const., Amdt. 14; <i>Mennonite, supra,</i> at 799.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In response to the returned form suggesting that Jones had not received notice that he was about to lose his property, the State did\u0097nothing. For the reasons stated, we conclude the State should have taken additional reasonable steps to notify Jones, if practicable to do so. The question remains whether there were any such available steps. While \"[i]t is not our responsibility to prescribe the form of service that the [government] should adopt,\" <i>Greene,</i> 456 U. S., at 455, n. 9, if there were no reasonable additional steps the government could have taken upon return of the unclaimed notice letter, it cannot be faulted for doing nothing.</p>\n<p>We think there were several reasonable steps the State could have taken. What steps are reasonable in response to new information depends upon what the new information reveals. The return of the certified letter marked \"unclaimed\" meant either that Jones still lived at 717 North Bryan Street, but was not home when the postman called and did not retrieve the letter at the post office, or that Jones no longer resided at that address. One reasonable step primarily addressed to the former possibility would be for the State to resend the notice by regular mail, so that a signature was not required. The Commissioner says that use of certified mail makes actual notice more likely, because requiring the recipient's signature protects against misdelivery. But that is only true, of course, when someone is home to sign for the letter, or to inform the mail carrier that he has arrived at the wrong address. Otherwise, \"[c]ertified <span class=\"star-pagination\">*235</span> mail is dispatched and handled in transit as ordinary mail,\" United States Postal Service, Domestic Mail Manual \u00a7 503.3.2.1 (Mar. 16, 2006), and the use of certified mail might make actual notice less likely in some cases\u0097the letter cannot be left like regular mail to be examined at the end of the day, and it can only be retrieved from the post office for a specified period of time. Following up with regular mail might also increase the chances of actual notice to Jones if\u0097 as it turned out\u0097he had moved. Even occupants who ignored certified mail notice slips addressed to the owner (if any had been left) might scrawl the owner's new address on the notice packet and leave it for the postman to retrieve, or notify Jones directly.</p>\n<p>Other reasonable followup measures, directed at the possibility that Jones had moved as well as that he had simply not retrieved the certified letter, would have been to post notice on the front door, or to address otherwise undeliverable mail to \"occupant.\" Most States that explicitly outline additional procedures in their tax sale statutes require just such steps. See n. 2, <i>supra.</i> Either approach would increase the likelihood that the owner would be notified that he was about to lose his property, given the failure of a letter deliverable only to the owner in person. That is clear in the case of an owner who still resided at the premises. It is also true in the case of an owner who has moved: Occupants who might disregard a certified mail slip not addressed to them are less likely to ignore posted notice, and a letter addressed to them (even as \"occupant\") might be opened and read. In either case, there is a significant chance the occupants will alert the owner, if only because a change in ownership could well affect their own occupancy. In fact, Jones first learned of the State's effort to sell his house when he was alerted by one of the occupants\u0097his daughter\u0097after she was served with an unlawful detainer notice.</p>\n<p>Jones believes that the Commissioner should have searched for his new address in the Little Rock phonebook <span class=\"star-pagination\">*236</span> and other government records such as income tax rolls. We do not believe the government was required to go this far. As the Commissioner points out, the return of Jones' mail marked \"unclaimed\" did not necessarily mean that 717 North Bryan Street was an incorrect address; it merely informed the Commissioner that no one appeared to sign for the mail before the designated date on which it would be returned to the sender. An open-ended search for a new address\u0097 especially when the State obligates the taxpayer to keep his address updated with the tax collector, see Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 26-35-705 (1997)\u0097imposes burdens on the State significantly greater than the several relatively easy options outlined above.</p>\n<p>The Commissioner complains about the burden of even those additional steps, but his argument is belied by Arkansas' current requirement that notice to homestead owners be accomplished by personal service if certified mail is returned, \u00a7 26-37-301(e) (Supp. 2005), and the fact that Arkansas transfers the cost of notice to the taxpayer or the tax sale purchaser, \u00a7 26-37-104(a). The Commissioner has offered no estimate of how many notice letters are returned, and no facts to support the dissent's assertion that the Commissioner must now physically locate \"tens of thousands of properties every year.\" <i>Post,</i> at 248. Citing our decision in <i>Greene</i> v. <i>Lindsey</i><i>,</i> the Solicitor General adds that posted notice could be taken down by children or vandals. But in <i>Greene,</i> we noted that outside the specific facts of that case, posting notice on real property is \"a singularly appropriate and effective way of ensuring that a person . . . is actually apprised of proceedings against him.\" 456 U. S., at 452-453. Successfully providing notice is often the most efficient way to collect unpaid taxes, see <i>Mennonite,</i> 462 U. S., at 800, n. 5 (more effective notice may ease burden on State if recipient arranges to pay delinquent taxes prior to tax sale); Tr. of Oral Arg. 24 (85 percent of tax delinquent properties in Arkansas are redeemed upon notice of delinquency), but rather <span class=\"star-pagination\">*237</span> than taking relatively easy additional steps to effect notice, the State undertook the burden and expense of purchasing a newspaper advertisement, conducting an auction, and then negotiating a private sale of the property to Flowers.</p>\n<p>The Solicitor General argues that requiring further effort when the government learns that notice was not delivered will cause the government to favor modes of providing notice that do not generate additional information\u0097for example, starting (and stopping) with regular mail instead of certified mail. We find this unlikely, as we have no doubt that the government repeatedly finds itself being asked to prove that notice was sent and received. Using certified mail provides the State with documentation of personal delivery and protection against false claims that notice was never received. That added security, however, comes at a price\u0097the State also learns when notice has <i>not</i> been received. We conclude that, under the circumstances presented, the State cannot simply ignore that information in proceeding to take and sell the owner's property\u0097any more than it could ignore the information that the owner in <i>Robinson</i> was in jail, or that the owner in <i>Covey</i> was incompetent.</p>\n<p>Though the Commissioner argues that followup measures are not constitutionally required, he reminds us that the State did make some attempt to follow up with Jones by publishing notice in the newspaper a few weeks before the public sale. Several decades ago, this Court observed that \"[c]hance alone\" brings a person's attention to \"an advertisement in small type inserted in the back pages of a newspaper,\" <i>Mullane,</i> 339 U. S., at 315, and that notice by publication is adequate only where \"it is not reasonably possible or practicable to give more adequate warning,\" <i>id.,</i> at 317. Following up by publication was not constitutionally adequate under the circumstances presented here because, as we have explained, it was possible and practicable to give Jones more adequate warning of the impending tax sale.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*238</span> The dissent forcefully articulates some basic principles about constitutionally required notice, principles from which we have no intention to depart. In particular, we disclaim any \"new rule\" that is \"contrary to <i>Dusenbery</i> and a significant departure from <i>Mullane.</i>\" <i>Post,</i> at 244. In <i>Dusenbery,</i> the Government was aware that someone at the prison had signed for the prisoner's notice letter, and we determined that this attempt at notice was adequate, despite the fact that the State could have made notice more likely by requiring the prisoner to sign for the letter himself. 534 U. S., at 171. In this case, of course, the notice letter was returned to the Commissioner, informing him that his attempt at notice had failed.</p>\n<p>As for <i>Mullane,</i> it directs that \"when notice is a person's due . . . [t]he means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.\" 339 U. S., at 315. Mindful of the dissent's concerns, we conclude, at the end of the day, that someone who actually wanted to alert Jones that he was in danger of losing his house would do more when the attempted notice letter was returned unclaimed, and there was more that reasonably could be done.</p>\n<p>As noted, \"[i]t is not our responsibility to prescribe the form of service that the [government] should adopt.\" <i>Greene, supra,</i> at 455, n. 9. In prior cases finding notice inadequate, we have not attempted to redraft the State's notice statute. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Tulsa Professional,</i> 485 U. S., at 490-491; <i>Robinson,</i> 409 U. S., at 40; <i>Schroeder</i> v. <i>City of New York,</i> 371 U. S. 208, 213-214 (1962); <i>Walker,</i> 352 U. S., at 116; <i>Covey,</i> 351 U. S., at 146-147. The State can determine how to proceed in response to our conclusion that notice was inadequate here, and the States have taken a variety of approaches to the present question. See n. 2, <i>supra.</i> It suffices for present purposes that we are confident that additional reasonable steps were available for Arkansas to employ before taking Jones' property.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*239</span> * * *</h2>\n<p>There is no reason to suppose that the State will ever be less than fully zealous in its efforts to secure the tax revenue it needs. The same cannot be said for the State's efforts to ensure that its citizens receive proper notice before the State takes action against them. In this case, the State is exerting extraordinary power against a property owner\u0097taking and selling a house he owns. It is not too much to insist that the State do a bit more to attempt to let him know about it when the notice letter addressed to him is returned unclaimed.</p>\n<p>The Commissioner's effort to provide notice to Jones of an impending tax sale of his house was insufficient to satisfy due process given the circumstances of this case. The judgment of the Arkansas Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA and JUSTICE KENNEDY join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>When petitioner failed to pay his property taxes for several consecutive years, respondent Commissioner of State Lands in Arkansas, using the record address that petitioner provided to the State, sent petitioner a letter by certified mail, noting his tax delinquency and explaining that his property would be subject to public sale if the delinquent taxes and penalties were not paid. After petitioner failed to respond, the State also published notice of the delinquency and public sale in an Arkansas newspaper. Soon after respondent Linda K. Flowers submitted a purchase offer to the State, it sent petitioner a second letter by certified mail explaining <span class=\"star-pagination\">*240</span> that the sale would proceed if the delinquent taxes and penalties were not paid.</p>\n<p>Petitioner argues that the State violated his rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because, in his view, the State failed to take sufficient steps to contact him before selling his property to Flowers. Petitioner contends that once the State became aware that he had not claimed the certified mail, it was constitutionally obligated to employ additional methods to locate him.</p>\n<p>Adopting petitioner's arguments, the Court holds today that \"when mailed notice of a tax sale is returned unclaimed, the State must take additional reasonable steps to attempt to provide notice to the property owner before selling his property, if it is practicable to do so.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 225. The Court concludes that it was practicable for Arkansas to take additional steps here\u0097namely, notice by regular mail, posting notice on petitioner's door, and addressing mail to \"`occupant.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 235. Because, under this Court's precedents, the State's notice methods clearly satisfy the requirements of the Due Process Clause, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the States from \"depriv[ing] any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" This Court has held that a State must provide an individual with notice and opportunity to be heard before the State may deprive him of his property. <i>Mullane</i> v. <i>Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 339 U. S. 306, 313 (1950). Balancing a State's interest in efficiently managing its administrative system and an individual's interest in adequate notice, this Court has held that a State must provide \"notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 313-314. As this Court has explained, \"when notice is a person's due . . . [t]he means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee <span class=\"star-pagination\">*241</span> might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 315. \"[H]eroic efforts,\" however, are not required. <i>Dusenbery</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 534 U. S. 161, 170 (2002). To the contrary, we have expressly rejected \"[a] construction of the Due Process Clause which would place impossible or impractical obstacles in the way [of the State].\" <i>Mullane, supra,</i> at 313-314. Thus, \"none of our cases . . . has required actual notice\"; instead, \"we have allowed the Government to defend the `reasonableness and hence the constitutional validity of any chosen method . . . on the ground that it is in itself reasonably certain to inform those affected.'\" <i>Dusenbery, supra,</i> at 169-170 (quoting <i>Mullane, supra,</i> at 315).</p>\n<p>The methods of notice employed by Arkansas were reasonably calculated to inform petitioner of proceedings affecting his property interest and thus satisfy the requirements of the Due Process Clause. The State mailed a notice by certified letter to the address provided by petitioner. The certified letter was returned to the State marked \"unclaimed\" after three attempts to deliver it. The State then published a notice of public sale containing redemption information in the Arkansas Democrat Gazette newspaper. After Flowers submitted a purchase offer, the State sent yet another certified letter to petitioner at his record address. That letter, too, was returned to the State marked \"unclaimed\" after three delivery attempts.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Arkansas' attempts to contact petitioner by certified mail at his \"record address,\" without more, satisfy due process. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*242</span> <i>Dusenbery, supra,</i> at 169. See also <i>Mullane, supra,</i> at 318; <i>Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc.</i> v. <i>Pope,</i> 485 U. S. 478, 490 (1988) (\"We have repeatedly recognized that mail service is an inexpensive and efficient mechanism that is reasonably calculated to provide actual notice\"); <i>Mennonite Bd. of Missions</i> v. <i>Adams,</i> 462 U. S. 791, 792, 798 (1983) (holding that \"notice <i>mailed</i> to [the affected party's] <i>last known available address</i>\" is sufficient where a State seeks to sell \"real property on which payments of property taxes have been delinquent\" (emphasis added)). Because the notices were sent to the address provided by petitioner himself, the State had an especially sound basis for determining that notice would reach him. Moreover, Arkansas exceeded the constitutional minimum by additionally publishing notice in a local newspaper.<sup>[2]</sup> See <i>Mullane, supra,</i> at 318. Due process requires nothing more\u0097and certainly not here, where petitioner had a statutory duty to pay his taxes and to report any change of address to the state taxing authority. See Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 26-35-705 (1997).</p>\n<p>My conclusion that Arkansas' notice methods satisfy due process is reinforced by the well-established presumption that individuals, especially those owning property, act in their own interest. Recognizing that \"`[i]t is the part of common prudence for all those who have any interest in [a thing], to guard that interest by persons who are in a situation to protect it,'\" <i>Mullane, supra,</i> at 316 (quoting <i>The Mary,</i> 9 Cranch 126, 144 (1815)), this Court has concluded that \"[t]he ways of an owner with tangible property are such that he usually arranges means to learn of any direct attack upon his possessory or proprietary rights,\" <i>Mullane,</i> 339 U. S., at 316. Consistent with this observation, Arkansas was free to \"indulge the assumption\" that petitioner had <span class=\"star-pagination\">*243</span> either provided the state taxing authority with a correct and up-to-date mailing address\u0097as required by state law\u0097\"or that he . . . left some caretaker under a duty to let him know that [his property was] being jeopardized.\"<sup>[3]</sup><i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Court does not conclude that certified mail is inherently insufficient as a means of notice, but rather that \"the government's knowledge that notice pursuant to the normal procedure was ineffective triggered an obligation on the government's part to take additional steps to effect notice.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 230. I disagree.</p>\n<p>First, whether a method of notice is reasonably calculated to notify the interested party is determined <i>ex ante, i. e.,</i> from the viewpoint of the government agency at the time its notice is sent. This follows from <i>Mullane,</i> where this Court rested its analysis on the information the sender had \"at hand\" when its notice was sent. 339 U. S., at 318. Relatedly, we have refused to evaluate the reasonableness of a particular method of notice by comparing it to alternative methods that are identified after the fact. See <i>Dusenbery,</i> 534 U. S., at 171-172. Today the Court appears to abandon both of these practices. Its rejection of Arkansas' selected method of notice\u0097a method this Court has repeatedly concluded is constitutionally sufficient\u0097is based upon information that was unavailable when notice was sent. Indeed, the Court's proposed notice methods\u0097regular mail, posting, and addressing mail to \"`occupant,'\" <i>ante,</i> at 234-235\u0097are entirely the product of <i>post hoc</i> considerations, including the discovery that members of petitioner's family continued to live in the house. Similarly, the Court's observation that \"[t]he Commissioner[`s] complain[t] about the burden of . . . additional steps . . . is belied by Arkansas' current requirement that notice to homestead owners be accomplished by personal service if certified mail is returned,\" <i>ante,</i> at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*244</span> 236, is contrary to <i>Dusenbery</i>'s \"conclusion that the Government ought not be penalized and told to `try harder' . . . simply because [it] has since upgraded its policies,\" 534 U. S., at 172.</p>\n<p>Second, implicit in our holding that due process does not require \"actual notice,\" see <i>id.,</i> at 169-170, is that when the \"government becomes aware . . . that its attempt at notice has failed,\" <i>ante,</i> at 227, it is not required to take additional steps to ensure that notice has been received. Petitioner's challenge to Arkansas' notice methods, and the Court's acceptance of it, is little more than a thinly veiled attack on <i>Dusenbery.</i> Under the majority's logic, each time a doubt is raised with respect to whether notice has reached an interested party, the State will have to consider additional means better calculated to achieve notice. Because this rule turns on speculative, newly acquired information, it has no natural end point, and, in effect, requires the States to achieve something close to actual notice. The majority's new rule is contrary to <i>Dusenbery</i> and a significant departure from <i>Mullane.</i></p>\n<p>The only circumstances in which this Court has found notice by mail and publication inadequate under the Due Process Clause involve situations where the state or local government knew at the outset that its notice efforts were destined to fail and knew how to rectify the problem prior to sending notice. See <i>Robinson</i> v. <i>Hanrahan,</i> 409 U. S. 38, 39 (1972) <i>(per curiam)</i> (intended recipient known to be in jail); <i>Covey</i> v. <i>Town of Somers,</i> 351 U. S. 141, 145 (1956) (intended recipient known to be incompetent and without a guardian).</p>\n<p>In <i>Robinson,</i> the State, having arrested petitioner and having detained him in county jail, immediately instituted forfeiture proceedings against his automobile and mailed notice of those proceedings to his residential address. 409 U. S., at 38. Robinson, who was incarcerated in the county jail during the entirety of the forfeiture proceedings, did not receive notice of the proceedings until after he was released <span class=\"star-pagination\">*245</span> and the forfeiture order had been entered. <i>Id.,</i> at 38-39. Because the State knew beforehand that Robinson was not at, and had no access to, the address to which it sent the notice, this Court held that the State's efforts were not \"`reasonably calculated'\" to notify him of the pending proceedings. <i>Id.,</i> at 40. Similarly, in <i>Covey,</i> the Court concluded that the methods of notice used by the town\u0097mailing, posting, and publishing\u0097were not reasonably calculated to inform Covey of proceedings adverse to her property interests because local officials knew prior to sending notice that she was \"without mental capacity to handle her affairs\" and unable to comprehend the meaning of the notices. 351 U. S., at 144, 146.</p>\n<p>By contrast, Arkansas did not know at the time it sent notice to petitioner that its method would fail, and Arkansas did not know that petitioner no longer lived at the record address simply because letters were returned \"unclaimed.\" Pet. for Cert. 3. \"[U]nclaimed\" does not necessarily mean that an address is no longer correct; it may indicate that an intended recipient has simply failed or refused to claim mail. See United States Postal Service, Domestic Mail Manual (DMM), \u00a7 507, Exh. 1.4.1, http://pe.usps.gov/ text/dmm300/507.htm.<sup>[4]</sup> Given that the State had been using the address provided by petitioner and that petitioner had a legal duty to maintain a current mailing address with the state taxing authority, return of the mail as \"unclaimed\" did not arm Arkansas with the type of specific knowledge that the governments had at hand in <i>Robinson</i> and <i>Covey.</i> Cf. <i>ante,</i> at 234. The State cannot be charged to correct a problem of petitioner's own creation and of which it was not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*246</span> aware.<sup>[5]</sup> Even if the State had divined that petitioner was no longer at the record address, its publication of notice in a local newspaper would have sufficed because <i>Mullane</i> authorizes the use of publication when the record address is unknown. See 339 U. S., at 316 (\"[P]ublication traditionally has been acceptable as notification supplemental to other action which in itself may reasonably be expected to convey a warning\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The Court's proposed methods, aside from being constitutionally unnecessary, are also burdensome, impractical, and no more likely to effect notice than the methods actually employed by the State.</p>\n<p>In Arkansas, approximately 18,000 parcels of delinquent real estate are certified annually. <i>Tsann Kuen Enterprises Co.</i> v. <i>Campbell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1466717\"><a href=\"/opinion/1466717/tsann-kuen-enterprises-co-v-campbell/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ark.</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span>, 119-120, 129 S. W. 3d 822, 828 (2003). Under the Court's rule, the State will bear the burden of locating thousands of delinquent property owners. These administrative burdens are not compelled by the Due Process Clause. See <i>Mullane, supra,</i> at 313-314; <i>Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc.,</i> 485 U. S., at 489-490 (stating that constitutionally sufficient notice \"need not be inefficient or burdensome\"). Here, Arkansas has determined that its law requiring property owners to maintain a current address with the state taxing authority, in conjunction with its authorization to send property notices to the record address, is an efficient and fair way to administer its tax collection system. The Court's decision today forecloses <span class=\"star-pagination\">*247</span> such a reasonable system and burdens the State with inefficiencies caused by delinquent taxpayers.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Court's proposed methods are no more reasonably calculated to achieve notice than the methods employed by the State here. Regular mail is hardly foolproof; indeed, it is arguably less effective than certified mail. Certified mail is tracked, delivery attempts are recorded, actual delivery is logged, and notices are posted to alert someone at the residence that certified mail is being held at a local post office. By creating a record, these features give parties grounds for defending or challenging notice. By contrast, regular mail is untraceable; there is no record of either delivery or receipt. Had the State used regular mail, petitioner would presumably argue that it should have sent notice by certified mail because it creates a paper trail.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court itself recognizes the deficiencies of its proposed methods. It acknowledges that \"[f]ollowing up with regular mail <i>might</i> . . . increase the chances of actual notice\"; \"occupants who ignored certified mail notice slips . . . <i>might</i> scrawl the owner's new address on the notice packet,\" <i>ante,</i> at 235 (emphasis added); and \"a letter addressed to [occupant] <i>might</i> be opened and read,\" <i>ibid.</i> (emphasis added). Nevertheless, the Court justifies its redrafting of Arkansas' notice statute <span class=\"star-pagination\">*248</span> on the ground that \"[its] approach[es] would increase the likelihood that the owner would be notified that he was about to lose his property . . . .\" <i>Ibid.</i> That, however, is not the test; indeed, we rejected such reasoning in <i>Dusenbery.</i> See 534 U. S., at 171 (rejecting the argument that \"the FBI's notice was constitutionally flawed because it was `substantially less likely to bring home notice' than a feasible substitute\" (some internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>The Court's suggestion that Arkansas post notice is similarly unavailing. The State's records are organized by legal description, not address, which makes the prospect of physically locating tens of thousands of properties every year, and posting notice on each, impractical. See <i>Tsann Kuen Enterprises Co., supra,</i> at 119-120, 129 S. W. 3d, at 828. Also, this Court has previously concluded that posting is an inherently unreliable method of notice. See <i>Greene</i> v. <i>Lindsey,</i> 456 U. S. 444, 453-454 (1982).</p>\n<p>Similarly, addressing the mail to \"`occupant,'\" see <i>ante,</i> at 235, is no more reasonably calculated to reach petitioner. It is sheer speculation to assume, as the Court does, that although \"[o]ccupants . . . might disregard a certified mail slip . . ., . . . a letter addressed to them (even as `occupant') might be opened and read.\" <i>Ibid.</i> It is at least as likely that an occupant who receives generically addressed mail will discard it as junk mail.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>If \"title to property should not depend on [factual] vagaries,\" <i>Dusenbery, supra,</i> at 171, then certainly it cannot turn on \"wrinkle[s],\" <i>ante,</i> at 227, caused by a property owner's own failure to be a prudent ward of his interests. The meaning of the Constitution should not turn on the antics of tax evaders and scofflaws. Nor is the self-created conundrum in which petitioner finds himself a legitimate ground for imposing additional constitutional obligations on the State. The State's attempts to notify petitioner by certified <span class=\"star-pagination\">*249</span> mail at the address that he provided and, additionally, by publishing notice in a local newspaper satisfy due process. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Arkansas Supreme Court.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Most Courts of Appeals have also concluded that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires the Federal Government to take further reasonable steps in the property forfeiture context. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>Ritchie,</i> 342 F. 3d 903, 911 (CA9 2003); <i>Foehl</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 238 F. 3d 474, 480 (CA3 2001); <i>Small</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 136 F. 3d 1334, 1337-1338 (CADC 1998); <i>Torres</i> v. <i>$36,256.80 U.

Some States require that notice be posted on the property or at the property owner's last known address either at the outset, see Del. Code Ann., Tit. 9, \u00a7\u00a7 8724, 8772 (1989 and Supp. 2004); Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 48-4-78(d) (Supp. 2005); Haw. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 246-56 (2003); Md. Tax-Prop. Code Ann. \u00a7 14-836(b)(6) (Lexis 2001); Okla. Stat., Tit. 68, \u00a7 3118(A), or as a followup measure when personal service cannot be accomplished or certified mail is returned, see Fla. Stat. \u00a7 197.522(2)(a) (2003); Minn. Stat. \u00a7 281.23, subd. 6; S. C. Code Ann. \u00a7 12-51-40(c) (Supp. 2005). And a few States require a diligent inquiry to find a property owner's correct address when mailed notice is returned. See Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 27-43-3 (1973-2002); Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 361.595(3)(b) (2003); Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 72, \u00a7 5860.607a (Purdon 1990); R. I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 44-9-25.1 (2005).\n</p>\n<p>See also 26 U. S.

See United States Postal Operations Manual \u00a7 813.25 (July 2002), http:// www.nalc.org/depart/cau/pdf/manuals/pom/pomc8.pdf (all Internet materials as visited Apr. 21, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court's case file) (\"The carrier must leave a notice of arrival on Form 3849 if the carrier cannot deliver the certified article for any reason\").</p>\n<p>[2]  The Court found inadequate the State's attempt at notice by publication, as if that were the State's <i>sole</i> method for effectuating notice, see <i>ante,</i> at 237. But the State plainly used it here as a <i>secondary</i> method of notice.</p>\n<p>[3]  The issue is not, as the Court maintains, whether the current occupant is \"charged with acting as the owner's agent.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 233. Rather, the issue is whether petitioner discharged his <i>own</i> duty to guard his interests.</p>\n<p>[4]  The Postal Service uses \"Moved, Left No Address\" to indicate that the \"[a]ddressee moved and filed no change-of-address order,\" and \"Not Deliverable as Addressed\u0097Unable to Forward\" to indicate that the mail is \"undeliverable at address given; no change-of-address order on file; forwarding order expired.\" DMM \u00a7 507, Exh. 1.4.1.</p>\n<p>[5]  The Court's \"storm drain\" hypothetical, <i>ante,</i> at 229, presents the harder question of when notice is sent\u0097at the precise moment the Commissioner places the mail in the postal carrier's hand or the split second later when he observes the departing carrier drop the mail down the storm drain. That more difficult question is not before us in this case because Arkansas learned long after the fact that its attempts had been unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>[6]  Interestingly, the Court stops short of saddling the State with the other steps that petitioner argues a State should take any time the interested party fails to claim letters mailed to his record address, see <i>ante,</i> at 235-236, namely, searching state tax records, the phonebook, the Internet, department of motor vehicle records, or voting rolls, contacting his employer, or employing debt collectors. Here, the Court reasons that because of the context\u0097the fact that the letter was returned merely \"unclaimed\" and petitioner had a duty to maintain a current address\u0097the State is not required to go as far as petitioner urges. <i>Ante,</i> at 236. Though the methods proposed by petitioner are severely flawed (for instance, the commonality of his surname \"Jones\" calls into question the fruitfulness of Internet and phonebook searches), there is no principled basis for the Court's conclusion that petitioner's other proposed methods would \"impos[e] burdens on the State significantly greater than the several relatively easy options outlined [by the Court].\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n\n</div>",
