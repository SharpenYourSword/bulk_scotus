The District Court granted the County's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the suit was barred by sovereign immunity. Relying on Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. We granted certiorari to consider \"[w]hether an entity that does not qualify as an `arm of the State' for Eleventh Amendment purposes can nonetheless assert sovereign immunity as a defense to an admiralty suit.\" 546 U. S. 959 (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*192</span> I</h2>\n<p>The County owns, operates, and maintains the Causton Bluff Bridge, a drawbridge over the Wilmington River. On October 6, 2002, James Ludwig requested that the bridge be raised to allow his boat to pass. The bridge malfunctioned, a portion falling and colliding with Mr. Ludwig's boat. As a result of the collision, Mr. Ludwig and his wife incurred damages in excess of $130,000.</p>\n<p>The Ludwigs submitted a claim for those damages to their insurer, Northern, which paid in accordance with the terms of their insurance policy. Northern then sought to recover its costs by filing suit in admiralty against the County in the District Court. The County sought summary judgment, arguing that Northern's claims were barred by sovereign immunity. The County conceded that Eleventh Amendment immunity did not extend to counties, but nonetheless contended that it was immune under \"the universal rule of state immunity from suit without the state's consent.\" Defendant's Brief in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, Case No. CV403-099, App. 33a. The District Court agreed, relying on <i>Broward County</i> v. <i>Wickman,</i> 195 F. 2d 614 (CA5 1952), to conclude that sovereign immunity extends to counties and municipalities that, as here, \"exercis[e] power delegated from the State.\" <i>Zurich Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Chatham County,</i> No. CV403-99, App. 77a.</p>\n<p>The Eleventh Circuit, which was bound to follow <i>Wickman</i> as Circuit precedent, affirmed.<sup>[1]</sup> The Court of Appeals acknowledged that the County did not assert an Eleventh Amendment immunity defense, which would fail because, under Circuit precedent, the County did not qualify as an arm of the State. <i>Zurich Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Chatham County,</i> No. 04-13308 (Jan. 28, 2005), App. 83a, n. 1, judgt. order reported <span class=\"star-pagination\">*193</span> at 129 Fed. Appx. 602. The Court of Appeals nonetheless concluded that \"common law has carved out a `residual immunity,' which would protect a political subdivision such as Chatham County from suit.\" App. 83a. We granted certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>This Court's cases have recognized that the immunity of States from suit \"is a fundamental aspect of the sovereignty which the States enjoyed before the ratification of the Constitution, and which they retain today . . . except as altered by the plan of the Convention or certain constitutional Amendments.\" <i>Alden</i> v. <i>Maine,</i> 527 U. S. 706, 713 (1999); see <i>Seminole Tribe of Fla.</i> v. <i>Florida,</i> 517 U. S. 44, 55-56 (1996); <i>Principality of Monaco</i> v. <i>Mississippi,</i> 292 U. S. 313, 322-323 (1934). Consistent with this recognition, which no party asks us to reexamine today, we have observed that the phrase \"`Eleventh Amendment immunity' . . . is convenient shorthand but something of a misnomer, for the sovereign immunity of the States neither derives from, nor is limited by, the terms of the Eleventh Amendment.\" <i>Alden,</i> 527 U. S., at 713.</p>\n<p>A consequence of this Court's recognition of preratification sovereignty as the source of immunity from suit is that only States and arms of the State possess immunity from suits authorized by federal law. See <i>id.,</i> at 740; <i>Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Doyle,</i> 429 U. S. 274, 280 (1977). Accordingly, this Court has repeatedly refused to extend sovereign immunity to counties. See <i>Lake Country Estates, Inc.</i> v. <i>Tahoe Regional Planning Agency,</i> 440 U. S. 391, 401 (1979); <i>id.,</i> at 401, n. 19 (gathering cases); <i>Workman</i> v. <i>New York City,</i> 179 U. S. 552, 565 (1900); <i>Lincoln County</i> v. <i>Luning,</i> 133 U. S. 529, 530 (1890). See also <i>Jinks</i> v. <i>Richland County,</i> 538 U. S. 456, 466 (2003) (\"[M]unicipalities, unlike States, do not enjoy a constitutionally protected immunity from suit\"). This is true even when, as respondent alleges here, \"such <span class=\"star-pagination\">*194</span> entities exercise a `slice of state power.'\" <i>Lake Country Estates, supra,</i> at 401.</p>\n<p>The County argues that this Court's cases recognize a distinct \"residual\" immunity that permits adoption of a broader test than we apply in the Eleventh Amendment context to determine whether an entity is acting as an arm of the State and is accordingly entitled to immunity.<sup>[2]</sup> Brief for Respondent 28. But this Court's use of that term does not suggest the County's conclusion; instead, this Court has referenced only the States' \"residuary and inviolable sovereignty\" that survived the Constitution. See The Federalist No. 39, p. 245 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison); <i>Federal Maritime Comm'n</i> v. <i>South Carolina Ports Authority,</i> 535 U. S. 743, 751 (2002).</p>\n<p>Because the County may claim immunity neither based upon its identity as a county nor under an expansive arm-of-the-State test, the County is subject to suit unless it was acting as an arm of the State, as delineated by this Court's precedents, in operating the drawbridge. <i>Alden, supra,</i> at 756; <i>Lake Country Estates, supra,</i> at 400-401. The County conceded below that it was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, and both the County and the Court of Appeals appear to have understood this concession to be based on the County's failure to qualify as an arm of the State under our precedent. See App. 83a, n. 1 (recognizing that the County rightly disclaimed an Eleventh Amendment immunity defense because such a defense would be inconsistent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*195</span> with the court's holding in <i>Vierling</i> v. <i>Celebrity Cruises, Inc.,</i> 339 F. 3d 1309 (CA11 2003), that the Broward County Port Authority was not an arm of the State); Brief of Appellee Chatham County in No. 04-13308DD (CA11), p. 13 (distinguishing <i>Vierling</i> in part because it dealt with the question of Eleventh Amendment immunity); see also Brief for Respondent 8 (implicitly conceding that respondent is not an arm of the State under our Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence). Moreover, the question on which we granted certiorari is premised on the conclusion that the County is not \"an `arm of the State' for Eleventh Amendment purposes,\" 546 U. S. 959 (2005), and we presume that to be the case. Accordingly, the County's concession and the presumption underlying the question on which we granted review are dispositive.</p>\n<p>As an alternative ground for affirmance, the County asks the Court to recognize a distinct sovereign immunity against <i>in personam</i> admiralty suits that bars cases arising from a county's exercise of core state functions with regard to navigable waters. Recognition of a distinct immunity in admiralty cases cannot be reconciled with our precedents. Immunity in admiralty, like other sovereign immunity, is simply an application of \"the fundamental rule\" that \"the entire judicial power granted by the Constitution does not embrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a State without consent given.\" <i>Ex parte New York,</i> 256 U. S. 490, 497-500 (1921). Accordingly, this Court has resolved sovereign immunity questions in admiralty by relying upon principles set out in this Court's sovereign immunity cases, rather than by examining the history or jurisprudence specific to suits in admiralty. See <i>Federal Maritime Comm'n</i> v. <i>South Carolina Ports Authority, supra,</i> at 754-769 (an admiralty suit relying heavily on <i>Alden, supra</i> (plaintiff raised a Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 claim), and <i>Seminole Tribe of Fla.</i> v. <i>Florida, supra</i> (plaintiff alleged violation of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act)). Indeed, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*196</span> the Court applied the general principle that sovereign immunity does not bar a suit against a city to an admiralty suit as early as <i>Workman</i> v. <i>New York City,</i> 179 U. S. 552, which held that such immunity \"afforded no reason for denying redress in a court of admiralty for the wrong which . . . [had] been committed\" by the city of New York, <i>id.,</i> at 570.</p>\n<p>The County nonetheless contends\u0097and the Eleventh Circuit, in reliance upon the Fifth Circuit's analysis in <i>Wickman,</i> held\u0097that the reach of <i>Workman</i> is limited, and that this Court's decision in <i>Ex parte New York, supra</i><i>,</i> demonstrates that <i>Workman</i> does not govern the instant case. See <i>Wickman,</i> 195 F. 2d, at 615. We disagree. <i>Ex parte New York</i> extended sovereign immunity beyond cases \"in law or equity\" to cases in admiralty. As the County points out, <i>Ex parte New York</i> concluded that <i>Workman</i> involved only the substantive law of admiralty, and not the power of the Court to exercise jurisdiction over a particular defendant. <i>Ex parte New York, supra,</i> at 498. But <i>Workman</i> dealt only with the substantive law of admiralty precisely because the <i>Workman</i> Court held that admiralty courts have jurisdiction over municipal corporations. See 179 U. S., at 565 (\"[A]s a general rule, municipal corporations, like individuals, may be sued; in other words . . . they are amenable to judicial process for the purpose of compelling performance of their obligations\"). The <i>Workman</i> Court accordingly distinguished between the question before it\u0097whether courts of admiralty may, notwithstanding state law, \"redress a wrong committed by one over whom such courts have adequate jurisdiction,\" <i>id.,</i> at 566, such as a municipal corporation\u0097and the question <i>not</i> before it, but before the Court in <i>Ex parte New York</i>\u0097whether courts of admiralty may \"give redress in a case where jurisdiction over the person or property cannot be exerted,\" 179 U. S., at 566. In the former circumstance, the court should apply general admiralty principles, while in the latter the court lacks the power to do so. See <i>id.,</i> at 570; <i>Ex parte New York, supra,</i> at 499-500, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*197</span> 502-503. Because here, as in <i>Workman</i> and in contrast to <i>Ex parte New York,</i> the defendant was an entity generally within the jurisdiction of the District Court, <i>Ex parte New York</i> is inapposite, and <i>Workman</i> compels the conclusion that the County is unprotected by sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Because the County has failed to demonstrate that it was acting as an arm of the State when it operated the Causton Bluff Bridge, the County is not entitled to immunity from Northern's suit. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  <i>Thomas S. Biemer</i> filed a brief for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority as <i>amicus curiae</i> urging affirmance.</p>\n<p>[1]  See <i>Bonner</i> v. <i>Prichard,</i> 661 F. 2d 1206, 1209 (CA11 1981) (en banc) (adopting all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit announced prior to October 1, 1981, as binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit).</p>\n<p>[2]  It is unclear whether respondent believes that residual immunity is a common-law immunity that has been unaltered by federal substantive law, see Brief for Respondent 18 (\"Chatham County's sovereign immunity derives from the common law which pre-dates Eleventh Amendment immunity\"), or, as the Solicitor General appears to believe, a constitutionally based immunity that is distinguishable from the one drawn from the constitutional structure, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 16 (\"What respondent calls residual sovereign immunity . . . is the doctrine of constitutional sovereign immunity\"). In either case, it appears that the residual immunity would serve to extend sovereign immunity beyond its preratification scope.</p>\n\n</div>",

The Eleventh Circuit, which\n  was bound by that same precedent, affirmed. It acknowledged that\n  the County did not assert an Eleventh Amendment immunity de\n  fense, which would fail because, under other Circuit precedent, the\n  County did not qualify as an \u201carm of the State.\u201d The Court of Ap\n  peals nonetheless concluded that common law has carved out a \u201cre\n  sidual immunity\u201d that protects political subdivisions such as the\n  County from suit.\nHeld: An entity that does not qualify as an \u201carm of the State\u201d for Elev\n enth Amendment purposes cannot assert sovereign immunity as a\n defense to an admiralty suit. Pp. 3\u20137.\n    (a) Immunity from suit \u201cis a fundamental aspect of the sovereignty\n which the States enjoyed before the ratification of the Constitution,\n and which they retain today . . . except as altered by the plan of the\n Convention or certain constitutional Amendments.\u201d Alden v. Maine,\n 527 U. S. 706, 713. Thus, the phrase \u201c \u2018Eleventh Amendment immu\n nity\u2019 . . . is convenient shorthand but something of a misnomer, for\n the sovereign immunity of the States neither derives from, nor is lim\n ited by, the terms of the Eleventh Amendment.\u201d Id., at 713. Because\n preratification sovereignty is the source of immunity from suit, only\n2        NORTHERN INS. CO. OF N. Y. v. CHATHAM COUNTY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    States and arms of the State possess immunity from suits authorized\n    by federal law. See, e.g., id., at 740. Accordingly, sovereign immu\n    nity does not extend to counties, see, e.g., Lake Country Estates, Inc.\n    v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 440 U. S. 391, 401, and n. 19,\n    even when they \u201cexercise a \u2018slice of state power,\u2019 \u201d id., at 401. The\n    County argues unconvincingly that this Court has recognized a dis\n    tinct \u201cresidual\u201d immunity that permits adoption of a broader test\n    than it applies in the Eleventh Amendment context to determine\n    whether an entity is acting as an arm of the State entitled to immu\n    nity. The Court has referenced only the States\u2019 \u201cresiduary and invio\n    lable sovereignty\u201d that survived the Constitution. See, e.g., Federal\n    Maritime Comm\u2019n v.

Because the County may claim immunity neither based upon its\n    identity as a county nor under an expansive arm-of-the-State test, it\n    is subject to suit unless it was acting as an arm of the State, as de\n    lineated by this Court\u2019s precedents, in operating the drawbridge.\n    E.g., Alden, supra, at 756. The County conceded below that it was\n    not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, and both the County\n    and the Eleventh Circuit appear to have understood this concession\n    to be based on the County\u2019s failure to qualify as an \u201carm of the State\u201d\n    under this Court\u2019s precedent. Moreover, certiorari was granted in\n    this case premised on the conclusion that the County is not an arm of\n    the State for Eleventh Amendment purposes, and this Court pre\n    sumes that to be the case. The County\u2019s concession and this Court\u2019s\n    presumption are dispositive.

Such recogni\n    tion cannot be reconciled with the Court\u2019s precedents, which applied\n    the general principle that sovereign immunity does not bar a suit\n    against a city to an admiralty suit as early as Workman v.

But\n    Workman did so precisely because the Court there held that admiralty\n    courts have jurisdiction over municipal corporations. See 179 U. S., at\n    565.

Consistent with this rec\nognition, which no party asks us to reexamine today, we\nhave observed that the phrase \u201c \u2018Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity\u2019 . . . is convenient shorthand but something of a\nmisnomer, for the sovereign immunity of the States nei\nther derives from, nor is limited by, the terms of the Elev\nenth Amendment.\u201d Alden, supra, at 713.\n   A consequence of this Court\u2019s recognition of pre-\nratification sovereignty as the source of immunity from\nsuit is that only States and arms of the State possess\nimmunity from suits authorized by federal law. See\nAlden, supra, at 740; Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle,\n429 U. S. 274, 280 (1977). Accordingly, this Court has\nrepeatedly refused to extend sovereign immunity to coun\nties.

Rossiter ed. 1961) (J.\nMadison); Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n v. South Carolina\nPorts Authority, 535 U.

Alden,\nsupra, at 756; Lake Country Estates, supra, at 400\u2013401.\nThe County conceded below that it was not entitled to\nEleventh Amendment immunity, and both the County and\nthe Court of Appeals appear to have understood this con\ncession to be based on the County\u2019s failure to qualify as an\narm of the State under our precedent. See App. 83a, n. 1\n(recognizing that the County rightly disclaimed an Elev\nenth Amendment immunity defense because such a de\nfense would be inconsistent with the court\u2019s holding in\nVierling v.

S.\n___ (2005), and we presume that to be the case. Accord\ningly, the County\u2019s concession and the presumption un-\nderlying the question on which we granted review are\ndispositive.\n   As an alternative ground for affirmance, the County\nasks the Court to recognize a distinct sovereign immunity\nagainst in personam admiralty suits that bars cases aris\ning from a county\u2019s exercise of core state functions with\nregard to navigable waters. Recognition of a distinct\nimmunity in admiralty cases cannot be reconciled with our\nprecedents. Immunity in admiralty, like other sovereign\nimmunity, is simply an application of \u201cthe fundamental\nrule\u201d that \u201cthe entire judicial power granted by the Consti\ntution does not embrace authority to entertain a suit\nbrought by private parties against a State without consent\ngiven.\u201d Ex parte New York, 256 U. S. 490, 497\u2013500 (1921).\nAccordingly, this Court has resolved sovereign immunity\nquestions in admiralty by relying upon principles set out\nin this Court\u2019s sovereign immunity cases, rather than by\nexamining the history or jurisprudence specific to suits in\nadmiralty. See Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n v. South Caro\nlina Ports Authority, supra, at 754\u2013769 (an admiralty suit\nrelying heavily on Alden, supra (plaintiff raised a Fair\nLabor Standards Act of 1938 claim), and Seminole Tribe of\nFla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996) (plaintiff alleged viola\ntion of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act)). Indeed, the\nCourt applied the general principle that sovereign immu\nnity does not bar a suit against a city to an admiralty suit\n6     NORTHERN INS. CO. OF N. Y. v. CHATHAM COUNTY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nas early as Workman v. New York City, 179 U.

[had] been committed\u201d by the city of New York,\nid., at 570.\n   The County nonetheless contends\u2014and the Eleventh\nCircuit, in reliance upon the Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis in\nWickman, held\u2014that the reach of Workman is limited, and\nthat this Court\u2019s decision in Ex parte New York, supra,\ndemonstrates that Workman does not govern the instant\ncase. See Wickman, 195 F. 2d, at 615. We disagree. Ex\nparte New York extended sovereign immunity beyond cases\n\u201cin law or equity\u201d to cases in admiralty. As the County\npoints out, Ex parte New York concluded that Workman\ninvolved only the substantive law of admiralty, and not the\npower of the Court to exercise jurisdiction over a particular\ndefendant. Ex parte New York, supra, at 498. But Work\nman dealt only with the substantive law of admiralty pre\ncisely because the Workman Court held that admiralty\ncourts have jurisdiction over municipal corporations. See\n179 U. S., at 565 (\u201c[A]s a general rule, municipal corpora\ntions, like individuals, may be sued; in other words . . . they\nare amenable to judicial process for the purpose of compel\nling performance of their obligations\u201d). The Workman\nCourt accordingly distinguished between the question\nbefore it\u2014whether courts of admiralty may, notwithstand\ning state law, \u201credress a wrong committed by one over\nwhom such courts have adequate jurisdiction,\u201d id., at 566,\nsuch as a municipal corporation\u2014and the question not\nbefore it, but before the Court in Ex parte New York\u2014\nwhether courts of admiralty may \u201cgive redress in a case\nwhere jurisdiction over the person or property cannot be\nexerted,\u201d 179 U.

The District Court granted the County's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the suit was barred by sovereign immunity. Relying on Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.

On October 6, 2002, James Ludwig requested that the bridge be raised to allow his boat to pass. The bridge malfunctioned, a portion falling and colliding with Mr. Ludwig's boat. As a result of the collision, Mr. Ludwig and his wife incurred damages in excess of $130,000.</p>\n<p>The Ludwigs submitted a claim for those damages to their insurer, Northern, which paid in accordance with the terms of their insurance policy. Northern then sought to recover its costs by filing suit in admiralty against the County in the District Court. The County sought summary judgment, arguing that Northern's claims were barred by sovereign immunity. The County conceded that Eleventh Amendment immunity did not extend to counties, but nonetheless contended that it was immune under \"the universal rule of state immunity from suit without the state's consent.\" Defendant's Brief in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, Case No. CV403-099, App. 33a. The District Court agreed, relying on <i>Broward County</i> v. <i>Wickman,</i> 195 F. 2d 614 (CA5 1952), to conclude that sovereign immunity extends to counties and municipalities that, as here, \"exercis[e] power delegated from the State.\" <i>Zurich Ins.
