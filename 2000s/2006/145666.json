UNITED STATES\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n              No. 05\u20138400. Decided April 24, 2006 \n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  The petition for writ of certiorari to the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and the motion of\npetitioner for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are\ngranted. The judgment is vacated, and the case is re\nmanded to the Fifth Circuit for further consideration.\n  The Fifth Circuit concluded that petitioner\u2019s prior con\nviction for simple possession of a controlled substance\nconstituted a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d for purposes of\nUnited States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Man\nual \u00a74B1.1(a) (2003). The term \u201ccontrolled substance\noffense\u201d is defined in pertinent part, however, as \u201can\noffense under federal or state law . . . that prohibits . . .\nthe possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit\nsubstance) with intent to manufacture, import, export,\ndistribute, or dispense.\u201d \u00a74B1.2(b) (emphasis added).\nAccordingly, the Fifth Circuit erred in treating petitioner\u2019s\nconviction for simple possession as a \u201ccontrolled substance\noffense.\u201d The Solicitor General acknowledges that the\nFifth Circuit incorrectly ruled for the United States on\nthis ground.
