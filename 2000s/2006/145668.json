Additional present perfected rights so adjudicated by such adjustment shall be in annual quantities not to exceed the quantities of mainstream water necessary to supply the consumptive use required for irrigation of the practicably irrigable acres which are included within any area determined to be within a reservation by such final determination of a boundary and for the satisfaction of related uses. The quantities of diversions are to be computed by determining net practicably irrigable acres within each additional area using the methods set forth by the Special Master in this case in his report to this Court dated December 5, 1960, and by applying the unit diversion quantities thereto, as listed below:</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n                          Unit Diversion\n                        Quantity Acre-Feet\nIndian Reservation      Per Irrigable Acre\n  Cocopah                     6.37\n  Colorado River              6.67\n  Chemehuevi                  5.97\n  Ft.

If all or part of the adjudicated water rights of any of the five Indian reservations is used other than for irrigation or other agricultural application, the total consumptive use, as that term is defined in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*169</span> Article I(A) of this decree, for said reservation shall not exceed the consumptive use that would have resulted if the diversions listed in subparagraph (i) of paragraphs (1) through (5) of Article II(D) of this decree had been used for irrigation of the number of acres specified for that reservation in said paragraphs and for the satisfaction of related uses. Effect shall be given to this paragraph notwithstanding the priority dates of the present perfected rights as listed below. However, nothing in this paragraph (5) shall affect the order in which such rights listed below as \"MISCELLANEOUS PRESENT PERFECTED RIGHTS\" (numbered 7-21 and 29-80 below) shall be satisfied.

Additional present perfected rights so adjudicated by such adjustment shall be in annual quantities not to exceed the quantities of mainstream water necessary to supply the consumptive use required for irrigation of the practicably irrigable acres which are included within any area determined to be within a reservation by such final determination of a boundary and for the satisfaction of related uses. The quantities of diversions are to be computed by determining net practicably irrigable acres within each additional area using the methods set forth by the Special Master in this case in his report to this Court dated December 5, 1960, and by applying the unit diversion quantities thereto, as listed below:</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n                          Unit Diversion\n                        Quantity Acre-Feet\nIndian Reservation      Per Irrigable Acre\n  Cocopah                     6.37\n  Colorado River              6.67\n  Chemehuevi                  5.97\n  Ft.

If all or part of the adjudicated water rights of any of the five Indian reservations is used other than for irrigation or other agricultural application, the total consumptive use, as that term is defined in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*169</span> Article I(A) of this decree, for said reservation shall not exceed the consumptive use that would have resulted if the diversions listed in subparagraph (i) of paragraphs (1) through (5) of Article II(D) of this decree had been used for irrigation of the number of acres specified for that reservation in said paragraphs and for the satisfaction of related uses. Effect shall be given to this paragraph notwithstanding the priority dates of the present perfected rights as listed below. However, nothing in this paragraph (5) shall affect the order in which such rights listed below as \"MISCELLANEOUS PRESENT PERFECTED RIGHTS\" (numbered 7-21 and 29-80 below) shall be satisfied.
