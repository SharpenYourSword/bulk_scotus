The dispute in these cases concerns the meaning of the underscored words, in particular the words, \"in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section.\" Does this phrase refer to (violence committed pursuant to) those plans or purposes that affect interstate commerce <i>through robbery or extortion?</i> Or does it refer to (violence committed pursuant to) those plans or purposes that affect interstate commerce, plain and simple? If the former, the statute governs only a limited subset of violent behavior, namely, behavior connected with robbery and extortion. If the latter, the statute governs a far broader range of human activity, namely, all violent actions (against persons or property) that affect interstate commerce. In our view, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> former, more restrictive reading of the Act is the correct interpretation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioners are individuals (and organizations) who engage in pro-life, anti-abortion protest activities. Respondents are health care clinics that perform abortions and a pro-choice national nonprofit organization that supports the legal availability of abortions. In 1986, (pro-choice) respondents, believing that (pro-life) petitioners had tried to disrupt activities at health care clinics that perform abortions through violence and various other unlawful activities, brought this legal action, which sought damages and an injunction forbidding (pro-life) petitioners from engaging in such activities anywhere in the Nation.</p>\n<p>Respondents based their legal claims upon the Hobbs Act, certain other laws that forbid extortion, and a federal anti-racketeering statute, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S. C. § 1962. Respondents argued that petitioners' clinic-related protest activities amounted in context to extortion. They added that these extortionate acts created a \"pattern of racketeering activity\"a pattern that RICO defines in terms of certain predicate acts that include acts of extortion. See § 1961(1) (2000 ed., Supp. III). And they sought a permanent injunction, which they believed RICO authorized. See § 1964 (2000 ed.).</p>\n<p>Initially, the District Court dismissed their complaint. It concluded that RICO requires proof that the alleged criminal acts were motivated by an economic purposea purpose that is lacking here. <i>National Organization for Women, Inc.</i> v. <i>Scheidler,</i> 765 F. Supp. 937 (ND Ill. 1991). The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed. <i>National Organization for Women, Inc.</i> v. <i>Scheidler,</i> 968 F. 2d 612 (1992). But this Court held that the statute \"requires no such economic motive,\" and therefore reversed the Court of Appeals and remanded the case for further proceedings. <i>National</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> <i>Organization for Women, Inc.</i> v. <i>Scheidler,</i> 510 U. S. 249, 252 (1994).</p>\n<p>After trial, the jury found that petitioners had engaged in a host of extortionate, or extortion-related, acts. It awarded treble damages to two of the respondents (a matter not at issue here), and the District Court entered a nationwide injunction. See §§ 1964(a), (c). The Court of Appeals affirmed. 267 F. 3d 687 (2001).</p>\n<p>This Court again reversed. <i>Scheidler</i> v. <i>National Organization for Women, Inc.,</i> 537 U. S. 393 (2003) <i>(NOW II).</i> We noted that the Hobbs Act defines \"extortion\" as necessarily including the improper \"`obtaining of property from another.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 400 (quoting § 1951(b)(2)). We pointed out that the claimed \"property\" consisted of \"a woman's right to seek medical services from a clinic, the right of the doctors, nurses or other clinic staff to perform their jobs, and the right of the clinics to provide medical services free from wrongful threats, violence, coercion and fear.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 400-401 (internal quotation marks omitted). We decided that \"[w]hatever the outer boundaries may be, the effort to characterize petitioners' actions here as an `obtaining of property from' respondents is well beyond them.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 402. Accordingly, we held that \"because they did not `obtain' property from respondents,\" petitioners \"did not commit extortion\" as defined by the Hobbs Act. <i>Id.,</i> at 397. We found that the state extortion law violations, and other extortion-related violations, were flawed for the same reason and must also be set aside. <i>Id.,</i> at 410.</p>\n<p>Our opinion concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Because all of the predicate acts supporting the jury's finding of a RICO violation must be reversed, the judgment that petitioners violated RICO must also be reversed. Without an underlying RICO violation, the injunction issued by the District Court must necessarily be vacated.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 411.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> On remand, the Court of Appeals did not order the District Court to terminate the cases or to vacate its injunction. Instead, the Court of Appeals considered respondents' argument that the jury's RICO verdict rested not only upon many instances of extortion-related conduct, but also upon four instances (or threats) of physical violence <i>unrelated</i> to extortion. 91 Fed. Appx. 510, 512 (2004). The Court of Appeals decided that the parties had not presented this theory to this Court and, as a result, we had no occasion to consider whether these four acts alone might constitute Hobbs Act violations (sufficient, as predicate acts under RICO, to support the nationwide injunction). See <i>id.,</i> at 513. The Court of Appeals remanded the cases to the District Court to make that determination. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Petitioners sought certiorari to review this ruling. We granted the writ to consider the following three questions:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) Whether the Court of Appeals improperly disregarded this Court's mandate in <i>NOW II</i> by holding that the injunction issued by the District Court might not need to be vacated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) Whether the Hobbs Act forbids violent conduct unrelated to extortion or robbery; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) Whether RICO authorizes a private party to obtain an injunction.</blockquote>\n<p>We now answer the second question. We hold that physical violence unrelated to robbery or extortion falls outside the scope of the Hobbs Act. And since our answer to the second question requires an entry of judgment in petitioners' favor, we shall not answer the first or third questions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We first set forth the Hobbs Act's text. The relevant statutory section imposes criminal liability on</p>\n<blockquote>\"[w]hoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property <i>in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section</i> ....\" 18 U. S. C. § 1951(a) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>The question, as we have said, concerns the meaning of the phrase that modifies the term \"physical violence,\" namely, the words \"in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section.\" Do those words refer to violence (1) that furthers a plan or purpose to \"affec[t] commerce ... by robbery or extortion,\" or to violence (2) that furthers a plan or purpose simply to \"affec[t] commerce\"? We believe the former, more restrictive, reading of the textthe reading that ties the violence to robbery or extortionis correct.</p>\n<p>For one thing, the language of the statute makes the more restrictive reading the more natural one. The text that precedes the physical violence clause does not forbid <i>obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce</i> (or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce); rather, it forbids <i>obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce \"by robbery or extortion.\" Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). This language means that behavior that obstructs, delays, or affects commerce is a \"violation\" of the statute only if that behavior also involves robbery or extortion (or related attempts or conspiracies). Consequently, the reference in the physical violence clause to actions or threats of violence \"in furtherance of a plan or purpose <i>to do anything in violation of this section</i>\" (emphasis added) would seem to mean acts or threats of violence in furtherance of a plan or purpose <i>to engage in robbery or extortion,</i> for that is the only kind of behavior that the section otherwise makes a violation.</p>\n<p>This restrictive reading is further supported by the fact that Congress often intends such statutory terms as \"affect commerce\" or \"in commerce\" to be read as terms of art connecting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> the congressional exercise of legislative authority with the constitutional provision (here, the Commerce Clause) that grants Congress that authority. See <i>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos.</i> v. <i>Dobson,</i> 513 U. S. 265, 273 (1995); <i>Russell</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 471 U. S. 858, 859 (1985). Such jurisdictional language may limit, but it will not primarily define, the behavior that the statute calls a \"violation\" of federal law. Cf. <i>Jones</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 529 U. S. 848, 854 (2000) (holding that by using the term \"affecting ... commerce,\" \"`Congress did not define the crime described in [18 U. S. C.] § 844(i) as the explosion of a building whose damage or destruction might affect interstate commerce,'\" and noting that the Court must look to other \"qualifying language\" in the provision to define the offense).</p>\n<p>For another thing, the statute's history supports the more restrictive reading. Congress enacted the Hobbs Act's predecessor in 1934. See Anti-Racketeering Act, ch. 569, 48 Stat. 979 (reproduced in Appendix A, <i>infra</i>). That predecessor Act prohibited coercion and extortion appropriately connected with interstate commerce, and placed these prohibitions in §§ 2(a) and 2(b), respectively. 48 Stat. 980. The Act went on in § 2(c) to impose criminal liability on anyone who, in connection with interstate commerce, \"[c]ommits or threatens to commit an act of physical violence or physical injury to a person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to violate sections (a) or (b).\" <i>Ibid.;</i> see also <i>NOW II,</i> 537 U. S., at 407. The 1934 Act explicitly linked § 2(c), the physical violence subsection, with §§ 2(a) and 2(b). It thereby made crystal clear that the physical violence that it prohibited was not violence in furtherance of a plan to injure commerce, but violence in furtherance of a plan to injure commerce <i>through coercion or extortion.</i></p>\n<p>In 1946, Congress enacted a superseding law, namely, the Hobbs Act. Ch. 537, 60 Stat. 420 (reproduced in Appendix B, <i>infra</i>). The new law changed the old law in two significant respects: It added robbery while omitting coercion. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> <i>NOW II, supra,</i> at 407; see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Culbert,</i> 435 U. S. 371, 377 (1978) (\"The bill that eventually became the Hobbs Act ... substituted specific prohibitions against robbery and extortion for the Anti-Racketeering Act's language\"). The new Act, like the old Act, was absolutely explicit in respect to the point here at issue, the necessary link between physical violence and other crimes (now extortion and robbery).</p>\n<p>The 1946 Hobbs Act reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"SEC. 2. Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce, or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion, shall be guilty of a felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"SEC. 3. Whoever conspires with another or with others, or acts in concert with another or with others to do anything in violation of section 2 shall be guilty of a felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"SEC. 4. Whoever attempts or participates in an attempt to do anything in violation of section 2 shall be guilty of a felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"SEC. 5. Whoever commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property <i>in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of section 2</i> shall be guilty of a felony.\" 60 Stat. 420 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>As § 2 makes clear, the statute prohibits <i>robbery</i> and <i>extortion.</i> As § 5's reference to § 2 makes clear, the statute prohibits violence <i>only</i> when that violence furthers a plan or purpose to affect commerce by robbery or extortion. Each of the statute's other sections reflects the same approach; each explicitly refers back to § 2's prohibition against robbery and extortion.</p>\n<p>The Act's legislative history contains nothing to the contrary. Indeed, the Committee Reports and floor debates emphasized that \"the purpose of the bill was `to prevent anyone from obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce, or the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> movement of any article or commodity in commerce by robbery or extortion <i>as defined in the bill.</i>'\" <i>Culbert, supra,</i> at 377 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 238, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 9 (1945); emphasis added in <i>Culbert</i>); see <i>Culbert, supra,</i> at 376-378 (discussing legislative history). They nowhere suggested that Congress intended to make physical violence a freestanding crime.</p>\n<p>The present Hobbs Act language is less clear than the 1946 version. But the linguistic changes do not reflect a congressional effort to redefine the crime. To the contrary, Congress revised the Hobbs Act's language in 1948 as part of its general revision of the Criminal Code. That \"1948 Revision was not intended to create new crimes but to recodify those then in existence.\" <i>Morissette</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 342 U. S. 246, 269, n. 28 (1952). This Court has written that it will \"not presume that the revision worked a change in the underlying substantive law `unless an intent to make such [a] chang[e] is clearly expressed.'\" <i>Keene Corp.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 508 U. S. 200, 209 (1993) (quoting <i>Fourco Glass Co.</i> v. <i>Transmirra Products Corp.,</i> 353 U. S. 222, 227 (1957); alteration made in <i>Keene</i>). And here there is no evidence of any such intent. Rather, the Reviser's Notes indicate that the linguistic changes to the Hobbs Act simply amount to \"changes in phraseology and arrangement necessary to effect consolidation.\" H. R. Rep. No. 304, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., A131 (1947).</p>\n<p>Finally, respondents' Hobbs Act interpretation broadens the Act's scope well beyond what case law has assumed. It would federalize much ordinary criminal behavior, ranging from simple assault to murder, behavior that typically is the subject of state, not federal, prosecution. Decisions of this Court have assumed that Congress did not intend the Hobbs Act to have so broad a reach. See <i>NOW II,</i> 537 U. S., at 405 (noting that the Hobbs Act embodied extortion, which required the obtaining of property, not coercion); <i>id.,</i> at 411 (GINSBURG, J., concurring) (coercion, which is not covered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> by the Hobbs Act, \"more accurately describes the nature of petitioners' [non-property-related] actions\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Enmons,</i> 410 U. S. 396, 410 (1973) (Hobbs Act does not reach violent activity by union members seeking higher wages because such violence is not extortion and Congress did not intend to \"cover all overtly coercive conduct in the course of\" a labor dispute).</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, other Courts of Appeals that have considered the question have rejected respondents' construction of the Act. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Yankowski,</i> 184 F. 3d 1071 (CA9 1999); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Franks,</i> 511 F. 2d 25 (CA6 1975). And in 1994, Congress enacted a specific statute aimed directly at the type of abortion clinic violence and other activity at issue in this litigation, thereby suggesting it did not believe that the Hobbs Act already addressed that activity. See Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, 18 U. S. C. § 248(a)(3) (imposing criminal liability on anyone who \"intentionally damages or destroys the property of a facility, or attempts to do so, because such facility provides reproductive health services\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Respondents' contrary claim rests primarily upon a canon of statutory construction that favors interpretations that give a function to each word in a statute, thereby avoiding linguistic superfluity. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Menasche,</i> 348 U. S. 528, 538-539 (1955) (\"It is our duty `to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute'\" (quoting <i>Montclair</i> v. <i>Ramsdell,</i> 107 U. S. 147, 152 (1883))). They claim that, because the definitions of robbery or extortion (or related attempts or conspiracies) already encompass robbery or extortion that takes place through acts of violence (or related threats), \"[t]here would be no reason for the statute to include the clause prohibiting violence and threats of violence\" unless Congress intended to create a freestanding offense. Brief for Respondents 25; see 18 U. S. C. § 1951(b)(1) (defining \"robbery\" as the \"unlawful taking or obtaining of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> personal property ... <i>by means of actual or threatened force, or violence</i>\" (emphasis added)); § 1951(b)(2) (defining \"extortion\" as \"the obtaining of property from another ... <i>by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear</i>\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>Petitioners, however, have found a small amount of additional work for the words to do. Brief for Petitioners in No. 04-1244, pp. 33-36; see also Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 11-12. The Scheidler petitioners point to a hypothetical mobster who threatens violence and demands payment from a business. Those threats constitute attempted extortion; but the subsequent acts of violence against a noncomplying business by the subordinates of that mobster may not constitute attempted extortion and may not be punishable as a conspiracy to commit extortion if the subordinates were not privy to the mobster's plan. A specific prohibition of physical violence in furtherance of a plan to commit extortion would bring the subordinates' behavior within the statute's coverage. The United States adds that the physical violence clause permits prosecutors to bring multiple charges for the same conduct. For instance, the clause would apply to a defendant who injured bystanders during a robbery, permitting the Government to charge that defendant with the Hobbs Act crime of robbery and the separate Hobbs Act crime of using violence in furtherance of the robbery. Tr. of Oral Arg. 22.</p>\n<p>We concede that this additional work is small. But the need for language to cover such instances, or perhaps simply a desire to emphasize the problem of violence, led Congress in the original 1946 version of the Hobbs Act to make clear that the statute prohibited, not all physical violence, but only physical violence in furtherance of <i>a plan or purpose to engage in robbery or extortion.</i> See <i>supra,</i> at 19. And it is similarly clear that Congress intended to carry this view forward into the 1948 recodification. See <i>supra,</i> at 20-21. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> The canons of interpretation cannot lead us to a contrary conclusion. Those canons are tools designed to help courts better determine what Congress intended, not to lead courts to interpret the law contrary to that intent. <i>Chickasaw Nation</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 534 U. S. 84, 94 (2001) (noting that \"canons are not mandatory rules\" but guides \"designed to help judges determine the Legislature's intent,\" and that \"other circumstances evidencing congressional intent can overcome their force\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>We conclude that Congress did not intend to create a freestanding physical violence offense in the Hobbs Act. It did intend to forbid acts or threats of physical violence in furtherance of a plan or purpose to engage in what the statute refers to as robbery or extortion (and related attempts or conspiracies). The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cases are remanded for entry of judgment for petitioners.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>APPENDIXES TO OPINION OF THE COURT</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934, ch. 569, 48 Stat. 979, provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"AN ACT</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"To protect trade and commerce against interference by violence, threats, coercion, or intimidation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"<i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,</i> That the term `trade or commerce', as used <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> herein, is defined to mean trade or commerce between any States, with foreign nations, in the District of Columbia, in any Territory of the United States, between any such Territory or the District of Columbia and any State or other Territory, and all other trade or commerce over which the United States has constitutional jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"SEC. 2.

The dispute in these cases concerns the meaning of the underscored words, in particular the words, \"in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section.\" Does this phrase refer to (violence committed pursuant to) those plans or purposes that affect interstate commerce <i>through robbery or extortion?</i> Or does it refer to (violence committed pursuant to) those plans or purposes that affect interstate commerce, plain and simple? If the former, the statute governs only a limited subset of violent behavior, namely, behavior connected with robbery and extortion. If the latter, the statute governs a far broader range of human activity, namely, all violent actions (against persons or property) that affect interstate commerce. In our view, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> former, more restrictive reading of the Act is the correct interpretation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioners are individuals (and organizations) who engage in pro-life, anti-abortion protest activities. Respondents are health care clinics that perform abortions and a pro-choice national nonprofit organization that supports the legal availability of abortions. In 1986, (pro-choice) respondents, believing that (pro-life) petitioners had tried to disrupt activities at health care clinics that perform abortions through violence and various other unlawful activities, brought this legal action, which sought damages and an injunction forbidding (pro-life) petitioners from engaging in such activities anywhere in the Nation.</p>\n<p>Respondents based their legal claims upon the Hobbs Act, certain other laws that forbid extortion, and a federal anti-racketeering statute, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S. C. § 1962. Respondents argued that petitioners' clinic-related protest activities amounted in context to extortion. They added that these extortionate acts created a \"pattern of racketeering activity\"a pattern that RICO defines in terms of certain predicate acts that include acts of extortion. See § 1961(1) (2000 ed., Supp. III). And they sought a permanent injunction, which they believed RICO authorized. See § 1964 (2000 ed.).</p>\n<p>Initially, the District Court dismissed their complaint. It concluded that RICO requires proof that the alleged criminal acts were motivated by an economic purposea purpose that is lacking here. <i>National Organization for Women, Inc.</i> v. <i>Scheidler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2351189\"><a href=\"/opinion/2351189/national-organization-for-women-inc-v-scheidler/\"><span class=\"volume\">765</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">937</span></a></span> (ND Ill. 1991). The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed. <i>National Organization for Women, Inc.</i> v. <i>Scheidler,</i> 968 F. 2d 612 (1992). But this Court held that the statute \"requires no such economic motive,\" and therefore reversed the Court of Appeals and remanded the case for further proceedings. <i>National</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> <i>Organization for Women, Inc.</i> v. <i>Scheidler,</i> 510 U. S. 249, 252 (1994).</p>\n<p>After trial, the jury found that petitioners had engaged in a host of extortionate, or extortion-related, acts. It awarded treble damages to two of the respondents (a matter not at issue here), and the District Court entered a nationwide injunction. See §§ 1964(a), (c). The Court of Appeals affirmed. 267 F. 3d 687 (2001).</p>\n<p>This Court again reversed. <i>Scheidler</i> v. <i>National Organization for Women, Inc.,</i> 537 U. S. 393 (2003) <i>(NOW II).</i> We noted that the Hobbs Act defines \"extortion\" as necessarily including the improper \"`obtaining of property from another.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 400 (quoting § 1951(b)(2)). We pointed out that the claimed \"property\" consisted of \"a woman's right to seek medical services from a clinic, the right of the doctors, nurses or other clinic staff to perform their jobs, and the right of the clinics to provide medical services free from wrongful threats, violence, coercion and fear.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 400-401 (internal quotation marks omitted). We decided that \"[w]hatever the outer boundaries may be, the effort to characterize petitioners' actions here as an `obtaining of property from' respondents is well beyond them.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 402. Accordingly, we held that \"because they did not `obtain' property from respondents,\" petitioners \"did not commit extortion\" as defined by the Hobbs Act. <i>Id.,</i> at 397. We found that the state extortion law violations, and other extortion-related violations, were flawed for the same reason and must also be set aside. <i>Id.,</i> at 410.</p>\n<p>Our opinion concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Because all of the predicate acts supporting the jury's finding of a RICO violation must be reversed, the judgment that petitioners violated RICO must also be reversed. Without an underlying RICO violation, the injunction issued by the District Court must necessarily be vacated.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 411.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> On remand, the Court of Appeals did not order the District Court to terminate the cases or to vacate its injunction. Instead, the Court of Appeals considered respondents' argument that the jury's RICO verdict rested not only upon many instances of extortion-related conduct, but also upon four instances (or threats) of physical violence <i>unrelated</i> to extortion. 91 Fed. Appx. 510, 512 (2004). The Court of Appeals decided that the parties had not presented this theory to this Court and, as a result, we had no occasion to consider whether these four acts alone might constitute Hobbs Act violations (sufficient, as predicate acts under RICO, to support the nationwide injunction). See <i>id.,</i> at 513. The Court of Appeals remanded the cases to the District Court to make that determination. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Petitioners sought certiorari to review this ruling. We granted the writ to consider the following three questions:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) Whether the Court of Appeals improperly disregarded this Court's mandate in <i>NOW II</i> by holding that the injunction issued by the District Court might not need to be vacated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) Whether the Hobbs Act forbids violent conduct unrelated to extortion or robbery; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) Whether RICO authorizes a private party to obtain an injunction.</blockquote>\n<p>We now answer the second question. We hold that physical violence unrelated to robbery or extortion falls outside the scope of the Hobbs Act. And since our answer to the second question requires an entry of judgment in petitioners' favor, we shall not answer the first or third questions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We first set forth the Hobbs Act's text. The relevant statutory section imposes criminal liability on</p>\n<blockquote>\"[w]hoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property <i>in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section</i> ....\" 18 U. S. C. § 1951(a) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>The question, as we have said, concerns the meaning of the phrase that modifies the term \"physical violence,\" namely, the words \"in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section.\" Do those words refer to violence (1) that furthers a plan or purpose to \"affec[t] commerce ... by robbery or extortion,\" or to violence (2) that furthers a plan or purpose simply to \"affec[t] commerce\"? We believe the former, more restrictive, reading of the textthe reading that ties the violence to robbery or extortionis correct.</p>\n<p>For one thing, the language of the statute makes the more restrictive reading the more natural one. The text that precedes the physical violence clause does not forbid <i>obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce</i> (or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce); rather, it forbids <i>obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce \"by robbery or extortion.\" Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). This language means that behavior that obstructs, delays, or affects commerce is a \"violation\" of the statute only if that behavior also involves robbery or extortion (or related attempts or conspiracies). Consequently, the reference in the physical violence clause to actions or threats of violence \"in furtherance of a plan or purpose <i>to do anything in violation of this section</i>\" (emphasis added) would seem to mean acts or threats of violence in furtherance of a plan or purpose <i>to engage in robbery or extortion,</i> for that is the only kind of behavior that the section otherwise makes a violation.</p>\n<p>This restrictive reading is further supported by the fact that Congress often intends such statutory terms as \"affect commerce\" or \"in commerce\" to be read as terms of art connecting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> the congressional exercise of legislative authority with the constitutional provision (here, the Commerce Clause) that grants Congress that authority. See <i>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos.</i> v. <i>Dobson,</i> 513 U. S. 265, 273 (1995); <i>Russell</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 471 U. S. 858, 859 (1985). Such jurisdictional language may limit, but it will not primarily define, the behavior that the statute calls a \"violation\" of federal law. Cf. <i>Jones</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 529 U. S. 848, 854 (2000) (holding that by using the term \"affecting ... commerce,\" \"`Congress did not define the crime described in [18 U. S. C.] § 844(i) as the explosion of a building whose damage or destruction might affect interstate commerce,'\" and noting that the Court must look to other \"qualifying language\" in the provision to define the offense).</p>\n<p>For another thing, the statute's history supports the more restrictive reading. Congress enacted the Hobbs Act's predecessor in 1934. See Anti-Racketeering Act, ch. 569, 48 Stat. 979 (reproduced in Appendix A, <i>infra</i>). That predecessor Act prohibited coercion and extortion appropriately connected with interstate commerce, and placed these prohibitions in §§ 2(a) and 2(b), respectively. 48 Stat. 980. The Act went on in § 2(c) to impose criminal liability on anyone who, in connection with interstate commerce, \"[c]ommits or threatens to commit an act of physical violence or physical injury to a person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to violate sections (a) or (b).\" <i>Ibid.;</i> see also <i>NOW II,</i> 537 U. S., at 407. The 1934 Act explicitly linked § 2(c), the physical violence subsection, with §§ 2(a) and 2(b). It thereby made crystal clear that the physical violence that it prohibited was not violence in furtherance of a plan to injure commerce, but violence in furtherance of a plan to injure commerce <i>through coercion or extortion.</i></p>\n<p>In 1946, Congress enacted a superseding law, namely, the Hobbs Act. Ch. 537, 60 Stat. 420 (reproduced in Appendix B, <i>infra</i>). The new law changed the old law in two significant respects: It added robbery while omitting coercion. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> <i>NOW II, supra,</i> at 407; see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Culbert,</i> 435 U. S. 371, 377 (1978) (\"The bill that eventually became the Hobbs Act ... substituted specific prohibitions against robbery and extortion for the Anti-Racketeering Act's language\"). The new Act, like the old Act, was absolutely explicit in respect to the point here at issue, the necessary link between physical violence and other crimes (now extortion and robbery).</p>\n<p>The 1946 Hobbs Act reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"SEC. 2. Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce, or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion, shall be guilty of a felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"SEC. 3. Whoever conspires with another or with others, or acts in concert with another or with others to do anything in violation of section 2 shall be guilty of a felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"SEC. 4. Whoever attempts or participates in an attempt to do anything in violation of section 2 shall be guilty of a felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"SEC. 5. Whoever commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property <i>in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of section 2</i> shall be guilty of a felony.\" 60 Stat. 420 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>As § 2 makes clear, the statute prohibits <i>robbery</i> and <i>extortion.</i> As § 5's reference to § 2 makes clear, the statute prohibits violence <i>only</i> when that violence furthers a plan or purpose to affect commerce by robbery or extortion. Each of the statute's other sections reflects the same approach; each explicitly refers back to § 2's prohibition against robbery and extortion.</p>\n<p>The Act's legislative history contains nothing to the contrary. Indeed, the Committee Reports and floor debates emphasized that \"the purpose of the bill was `to prevent anyone from obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce, or the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> movement of any article or commodity in commerce by robbery or extortion <i>as defined in the bill.</i>'\" <i>Culbert, supra,</i> at 377 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 238, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 9 (1945); emphasis added in <i>Culbert</i>); see <i>Culbert, supra,</i> at 376-378 (discussing legislative history). They nowhere suggested that Congress intended to make physical violence a freestanding crime.</p>\n<p>The present Hobbs Act language is less clear than the 1946 version. But the linguistic changes do not reflect a congressional effort to redefine the crime. To the contrary, Congress revised the Hobbs Act's language in 1948 as part of its general revision of the Criminal Code. That \"1948 Revision was not intended to create new crimes but to recodify those then in existence.\" <i>Morissette</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 342 U. S. 246, 269, n. 28 (1952). This Court has written that it will \"not presume that the revision worked a change in the underlying substantive law `unless an intent to make such [a] chang[e] is clearly expressed.'\" <i>Keene Corp.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 508 U. S. 200, 209 (1993) (quoting <i>Fourco Glass Co.</i> v. <i>Transmirra Products Corp.,</i> 353 U. S. 222, 227 (1957); alteration made in <i>Keene</i>). And here there is no evidence of any such intent. Rather, the Reviser's Notes indicate that the linguistic changes to the Hobbs Act simply amount to \"changes in phraseology and arrangement necessary to effect consolidation.\" H. R. Rep. No. 304, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., A131 (1947).</p>\n<p>Finally, respondents' Hobbs Act interpretation broadens the Act's scope well beyond what case law has assumed. It would federalize much ordinary criminal behavior, ranging from simple assault to murder, behavior that typically is the subject of state, not federal, prosecution. Decisions of this Court have assumed that Congress did not intend the Hobbs Act to have so broad a reach. See <i>NOW II,</i> 537 U. S., at 405 (noting that the Hobbs Act embodied extortion, which required the obtaining of property, not coercion); <i>id.,</i> at 411 (GINSBURG, J., concurring) (coercion, which is not covered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> by the Hobbs Act, \"more accurately describes the nature of petitioners' [non-property-related] actions\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Enmons,</i> 410 U. S. 396, 410 (1973) (Hobbs Act does not reach violent activity by union members seeking higher wages because such violence is not extortion and Congress did not intend to \"cover all overtly coercive conduct in the course of\" a labor dispute).</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, other Courts of Appeals that have considered the question have rejected respondents' construction of the Act. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Yankowski,</i> 184 F. 3d 1071 (CA9 1999); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Franks,</i> 511 F. 2d 25 (CA6 1975). And in 1994, Congress enacted a specific statute aimed directly at the type of abortion clinic violence and other activity at issue in this litigation, thereby suggesting it did not believe that the Hobbs Act already addressed that activity. See Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, 18 U. S. C. § 248(a)(3) (imposing criminal liability on anyone who \"intentionally damages or destroys the property of a facility, or attempts to do so, because such facility provides reproductive health services\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Respondents' contrary claim rests primarily upon a canon of statutory construction that favors interpretations that give a function to each word in a statute, thereby avoiding linguistic superfluity. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Menasche,</i> 348 U. S. 528, 538-539 (1955) (\"It is our duty `to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute'\" (quoting <i>Montclair</i> v. <i>Ramsdell,</i> 107 U. S. 147, 152 (1883))). They claim that, because the definitions of robbery or extortion (or related attempts or conspiracies) already encompass robbery or extortion that takes place through acts of violence (or related threats), \"[t]here would be no reason for the statute to include the clause prohibiting violence and threats of violence\" unless Congress intended to create a freestanding offense. Brief for Respondents 25; see 18 U. S. C. § 1951(b)(1) (defining \"robbery\" as the \"unlawful taking or obtaining of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> personal property ... <i>by means of actual or threatened force, or violence</i>\" (emphasis added)); § 1951(b)(2) (defining \"extortion\" as \"the obtaining of property from another ... <i>by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear</i>\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>Petitioners, however, have found a small amount of additional work for the words to do. Brief for Petitioners in No. 04-1244, pp. 33-36; see also Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 11-12. The Scheidler petitioners point to a hypothetical mobster who threatens violence and demands payment from a business. Those threats constitute attempted extortion; but the subsequent acts of violence against a noncomplying business by the subordinates of that mobster may not constitute attempted extortion and may not be punishable as a conspiracy to commit extortion if the subordinates were not privy to the mobster's plan. A specific prohibition of physical violence in furtherance of a plan to commit extortion would bring the subordinates' behavior within the statute's coverage. The United States adds that the physical violence clause permits prosecutors to bring multiple charges for the same conduct. For instance, the clause would apply to a defendant who injured bystanders during a robbery, permitting the Government to charge that defendant with the Hobbs Act crime of robbery and the separate Hobbs Act crime of using violence in furtherance of the robbery. Tr. of Oral Arg. 22.</p>\n<p>We concede that this additional work is small. But the need for language to cover such instances, or perhaps simply a desire to emphasize the problem of violence, led Congress in the original 1946 version of the Hobbs Act to make clear that the statute prohibited, not all physical violence, but only physical violence in furtherance of <i>a plan or purpose to engage in robbery or extortion.</i> See <i>supra,</i> at 19. And it is similarly clear that Congress intended to carry this view forward into the 1948 recodification. See <i>supra,</i> at 20-21. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> The canons of interpretation cannot lead us to a contrary conclusion. Those canons are tools designed to help courts better determine what Congress intended, not to lead courts to interpret the law contrary to that intent. <i>Chickasaw Nation</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 534 U. S. 84, 94 (2001) (noting that \"canons are not mandatory rules\" but guides \"designed to help judges determine the Legislature's intent,\" and that \"other circumstances evidencing congressional intent can overcome their force\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>We conclude that Congress did not intend to create a freestanding physical violence offense in the Hobbs Act. It did intend to forbid acts or threats of physical violence in furtherance of a plan or purpose to engage in what the statute refers to as robbery or extortion (and related attempts or conspiracies). The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cases are remanded for entry of judgment for petitioners.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>APPENDIXES TO OPINION OF THE COURT</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934, ch. 569, 48 Stat. 979, provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\"AN ACT</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"To protect trade and commerce against interference by violence, threats, coercion, or intimidation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"<i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,</i> That the term `trade or commerce', as used <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> herein, is defined to mean trade or commerce between any States, with foreign nations, in the District of Columbia, in any Territory of the United States, between any such Territory or the District of Columbia and any State or other Territory, and all other trade or commerce over which the United States has constitutional jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"SEC. 2.

Argued November 30, 2005—Decided February 28,\n                            2006*\nRespondents, a national nonprofit organization that supports the legal\n   availability of abortions and two health care clinics that perform\n   abortions, filed a class action alleging that petitioners, individuals\n   and organizations that oppose legal abortion, engaged in a nation-\n   wide conspiracy to shut down abortion clinics through violence and\n   other unlawful acts. Arguing that petitioners’ activities amounted in\n   context to extortionate acts that created a pattern of racketeering ac-\n   tivity, respondents based their claims on, inter alia, the Hobbs Act,\n   which makes it a federal crime to “obstruc[t], dela[y], or affec[t] com-\n   merce . . . by . . . robbery or extortion . . . or commit[ting] or\n   threaten[ing] physical violence to any person or property in further-\n   ance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section,”\n   18 U. S. C. §1951(a), and on the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\n   Organizations Act (RICO), which defines a proscribed “pattern of\n   racketeering activity,” §1962(a), in terms of certain predicate acts\n   that include extortion, see §1961(1). After trial, the jury concluded\n   that petitioners violated RICO’s civil provisions, the Hobbs Act, and\n   other extortion-related laws. In Scheidler v. National Organization for\n   Women, Inc., 537 U. S. 393 (NOW II), this Court reversed the Seventh\n   Circuit’s affirmance of the jury’s award of damages and the District\n   Court’s issuance of a permanent nationwide injunction. The Court\n   noted that the Hobbs Act defines “extortion” as necessarily including\n   the improper “ ‘obtaining of property from another,’ ” id., at 400\n——————\n   * Together with No. 04–1352, Operation Rescue v.

NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN, \n\n                            INC.                                          \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    (quoting §1951(b)(2)); observed that the claimed “property” here con-\n    sisted of a woman’s right to seek clinic services and the rights of\n    clinic staff to perform their jobs and of clinics to provide care free\n    from wrongful threats, violence, coercion, and fear, id., at 400–401;\n    decided that characterizing petitioners’ actions as an “obtaining of\n    property from” respondents went well beyond permissible bounda-\n    ries, id., at 402; and held, therefore, that petitioners did not commit\n    extortion as defined by the Hobbs Act, id., at 397. The Court con-\n    cluded that, because all of the predicate acts supporting the jury’s\n    finding of a RICO violation had to be reversed, the judgment that pe-\n    titioners violated RICO must also be reversed, id., at 411. On re-\n    mand, the Court of Appeals decided that, because this Court had not\n    considered respondents’ alternative theory that the jury’s RICO ver-\n    dict rested not only on extortion-related conduct, but also on four in-\n    stances (or threats) of physical violence unrelated to extortion, the\n    cases must be remanded to the District Court to determine whether\n    these four acts alone might constitute Hobbs Act violations (suffi-\n    cient, as predicate acts under RICO, to support the injunction).\nHeld: Physical violence unrelated to robbery or extortion falls outside\n the Hobbs Act’s scope. Congress did not intend to create a freestand-\n ing physical violence offense. It did intend to forbid acts or threats of\n physical violence in furtherance of a plan or purpose to engage in\n what the Act refers to as robbery or extortion (and related attempts\n or conspiracies). Pp. 5–11.\n    (a) The more restrictive reading of the statutory text—the one ty-\n ing the prohibited violence to robbery or extortion—is correct. For\n one thing, it is the more natural reading. The text preceding the\n physical violence clause does not forbid obstructing, delaying, or af-\n fecting commerce; rather, it forbids obstructing, delaying, or affecting\n commerce “by robbery or extortion.” §1951(a) (emphasis added). This\n means that behavior that obstructs, delays, or affects commerce is a\n “violation” of the statute only if it also involves robbery or extortion\n (or related attempts or conspiracies). Consequently, the reference in\n the physical violence clause to actions or threats of violence “in fur-\n therance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this sec-\n tion” seems to mean acts or threats of violence in furtherance of a\n plan or purpose to engage in robbery or extortion, for that is the only\n kind of behavior that the section otherwise makes a violation. This\n restrictive reading is further supported by the fact that Congress of-\n ten intends such statutory terms as “affect commerce” or “in com-\n merce” to be read as terms of art connecting the congressional exer-\n cise of legislative authority with the constitutional provision (here,\n the Commerce Clause) granting that authority. See, e.g., Allied-\n Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265, 273. Such jurisdic-\n                   Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ntional language may limit, but it will not primarily define, the behav-\nior that the statute calls a “violation” of federal law. Cf. Jones v.\nUnited States, 529 U. S. 848, 854. Moreover, the statute’s history\nsupports the more restrictive reading: Both of the Hobbs Act’s prede-\ncessor statutes made clear that the physical violence they prohibited\nwas not violence in furtherance of a plan to injure commerce, but vio-\nlence in furtherance of a plan to injure commerce through coercion or\nextortion (1934 Act) or through extortion or robbery (1946 Act). The\nHobbs Act’s legislative history contains nothing to the contrary. That\nthe present statutory language is less clear than the 1946 version\ndoes not reflect a congressional effort to redefine the crime. To the\ncontrary, Congress revised the Act’s language in 1948 as part of its\ngeneral revision of the Criminal Code, which “was not intended to\ncreate new crimes but to recodify those then in existence.” Morissette\nv. United States, 342 U. S. 246, 269, n. 28. The Court will not presume\nthe revision worked a change in the underlying substantive law absent\na clearly expressed intent to do so. Keene Corp. v. United States, 508\nU. S. 200, 209. Here there is no evidence of any such intent. Finally,\nrespondents’ interpretation broadens the Hobbs Act’s scope well be-\nyond what case law has assumed. It would federalize much ordinary\ncriminal behavior, ranging from simple assault to murder, that typi-\ncally is the subject of state, not federal, prosecution. Congress did not\nintend the Hobbs Act to have so broad a reach. See, e.g., NOW II, su-\npra, at 405. Other Courts of Appeals have rejected respondents’ con-\nstruction of the Act. And in 1994, Congress enacted the Freedom of\nAccess to Clinic Entrances Act, 18 U. S. C. §248(a)(3), which was aimed\nspecifically at the type of activity at issue in this litigation, thereby\nsuggesting that Congress did not believe that the Hobbs Act already\naddressed that activity. Pp. 5–9.\n   (b) Respondents’ reliance on the canon of statutory construction fa-\nvoring interpretations that give a function to each word in a statute,\nthereby avoiding linguistic superfluity, is misplaced. They claim\nthat, because the definitions of robbery or extortion (or related at-\ntempts or conspiracies) already encompass robbery or extortion that\ntake place through acts of violence (or related threats), see\n§§1951(b)(1) and (2), there would be no reason for §1951(a) to contain\nits physical violence clause unless Congress intended to create a free-\nstanding offense. Petitioners, however, have found a small amount of\nadditional work for the clause to do. The Scheidler petitioners point\nto a hypothetical mobster who threatens violence and demands pay-\nment from a business. Those threats constitute attempted extortion;\nbut the subsequent acts of violence against a noncomplying business\nby the mobster’s subordinates might not constitute attempted extor-\ntion or be punishable as a conspiracy to commit extortion if the sub-\n4     SCHEIDLER v. NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN, \n\n                            INC.                                          \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    ordinates were not privy to the mobster’s plan, absent the specific\n    prohibition of physical violence in furtherance of a plan to commit ex-\n    tortion. The Government adds that the clause permits prosecutors to\n    bring multiple charges for the same conduct; e.g., a robber who in-\n    jured bystanders could be charged with the separate Hobbs Act\n    crimes of robbery and of using violence in furtherance of the robbery.\n    While this additional work is concededly small, Congress’ intent is\n    clear. Interpretive canons are designed to help courts determine\n    what Congress intended, not to lead them to interpret the law con-\n    trary to that intent. Pp. 9–11.\n91 Fed.

The dispute\nin these cases concerns the meaning of the underscored\nwords, in particular the words, “in furtherance of a plan or\npurpose to do anything in violation of this section.” Does\nthis phrase refer to (violence committed pursuant to) those\nplans or purposes that affect interstate commerce through\nrobbery or extortion? Or does it refer to (violence commit-\nted pursuant to) those plans or purposes that affect inter-\nstate commerce, plain and simple? If the former, the\n2   SCHEIDLER v. NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN, \n\n                           INC.                                \n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n\nstatute governs only a limited subset of violent behavior,\nnamely, behavior connected with robbery and extortion. If\nthe latter, the statute governs a far broader range of hu-\nman activity, namely, all violent actions (against persons\nor property) that affect interstate commerce. In our view,\nthe former, more restrictive reading of the Act is the cor-\nrect interpretation.\n                              I\n  Petitioners are individuals (and organizations) who\nengage in pro-life, anti-abortion protest activities. Re-\nspondents are health care clinics that perform abortions\nand a pro-choice national nonprofit organization that\nsupports the legal availability of abortions. In 1986, (pro-\nchoice) respondents, believing that (pro-life) petitioners\nhad tried to disrupt activities at health care clinics that\nperform abortions through violence and various other\nunlawful activities, brought this legal action, which sought\ndamages and an injunction forbidding (pro-life) petitioners\nfrom engaging in such activities anywhere in the Nation.\n  Respondents based their legal claims upon the Hobbs\nAct, certain other laws that forbid extortion, and a federal\nantiracketeering statute, the Racketeer Influenced and\nCorrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S. C. §1962.\nRespondents argued that petitioners’ clinic-related protest\nactivities amounted in context to extortion. They added\nthat these extortionate acts created a “pattern of racket-\neering activity”—a pattern that RICO defines in terms of\ncertain predicate acts that include acts of extortion. See\n§1961(1) (Supp. III). And they sought a permanent in-\njunction, which they believed RICO authorized. See §1964\n(2000 ed.).\n  Initially, the District Court dismissed their complaint.\nIt concluded that RICO requires proof that the alleged\ncriminal acts were motivated by an economic purpose—a\npurpose that is lacking here. National Organization for\n                  Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nWomen, Inc. v. Scheidler, 765 F. Supp. 937 (ND Ill. 1991).\nThe Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.\nNational Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 968\nF. 2d 612 (1992). But this Court held that the statute\n“requires no such economic motive,” and therefore re-\nversed the Court of Appeals and remanded the case for\nfurther proceedings. National Organization for Women,\nInc. v. Scheidler, 510 U. S. 249, 252 (1994).\n   After trial, the jury found that petitioners had engaged in\na host of extortionate, or extortion-related, acts. It awarded\ntreble damages to two of the respondents (a matter not at\nissue here) and the District Court entered a nationwide\ninjunction. See §§1964(a), (c). The Court of Appeals af-\nfirmed. 267 F. 3d 687 (2001).\n   This Court again reversed. Scheidler v. National Or-\nganization for Women, Inc., 537 U. S. 393 (2003) (NOW II).\nWe noted that the Hobbs Act defines “extortion” as neces-\nsarily including the improper “ ‘obtaining of property from\nanother.’ ” Id., at 400 (quoting §1951(b)(2)). We pointed\nout that the claimed “property” consisted of “a woman’s\nright to seek medical services from a clinic, the right of the\ndoctors, nurses or other clinic staff to perform their jobs,\nand the right of the clinics to provide medical services free\nfrom wrongful threats, violence, coercion and fear.” 537\nU. S., at 400–401 (internal quotation marks omitted). We\ndecided that “[w]hatever the outer boundaries may be, the\neffort to characterize petitioners’ actions here as an ‘ob-\ntaining of property from’ respondents is well beyond\nthem.” Id., at 402. Accordingly, we held that “because\nthey did not ‘obtain’ property from respondents,” petition-\ners “did not commit extortion” as defined by the Hobbs\nAct. Id., at 397. We found that the state extortion law\nviolations, and other extortion-related violations, were\nflawed for the same reason and must also be set aside.\nId., at 410.\n   Our opinion concluded:\n4   SCHEIDLER v. NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN, \n\n                           INC.                                \n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n\n    “Because all of the predicate acts supporting the jury’s\n    finding of a RICO violation must be reversed, the\n    judgment that petitioners violated RICO must also be\n    reversed. Without an underlying RICO violation, the\n    injunction issued by the District Court must necessar-\n    ily be vacated.” Id., at 411.\n   On remand, the Court of Appeals did not order the\nDistrict Court to terminate the cases or to vacate its in-\njunction. Instead, the Court of Appeals considered re-\nspondents’ argument that the jury’s RICO verdict rested\nnot only upon many instances of extortion-related conduct,\nbut also upon four instances (or threats) of physical vio-\nlence unrelated to extortion. 91 Fed. Appx. 510, 512\n(2004). The Court of Appeals decided that the parties had\nnot presented this theory to this Court and, as a result, we\nhad no occasion to consider whether these four acts alone\nmight constitute Hobbs Act violations (sufficient, as predi-\ncate acts under RICO, to support the nationwide injunc-\ntion). See id., at 513. The Court of Appeals remanded the\ncases to the District Court to make that determination.\nIbid.\n   Petitioners sought certiorari to review this ruling. We\ngranted the writ to consider the following three questions:\n      (1) Whether the Court of Appeals improperly disre-\n    garded this Court’s mandate in NOW II by holding\n    that the injunction issued by the District Court might\n    not need to be vacated;\n      (2) Whether the Hobbs Act forbids violent conduct\n    unrelated to extortion or robbery; and\n      (3) Whether RICO authorizes a private party to ob-\n    tain an injunction.\nWe now answer the second question. We hold that physi-\ncal violence unrelated to robbery or extortion falls outside\nthe scope of the Hobbs Act. And since our answer to the\nsecond question requires an entry of judgment in petition-\n                  Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ners’ favor, we shall not answer the first or third questions.\n                             II\n  We first set forth the Hobbs Act’s text. The relevant\nstatutory section imposes criminal liability on\n    “[w]hoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or\n    affects commerce or the movement of any article or\n    commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or at-\n    tempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens\n    physical violence to any person or property in further-\n    ance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of\n    this section . . . .” 18 U. S. C. §1951(a) (emphasis\n    added).\n  The question, as we have said, concerns the meaning of\nthe phrase that modifies the term “physical violence,”\nnamely, the words “in furtherance of a plan or purpose to\ndo anything in violation of this section.” Do those words\nrefer to violence (1) that furthers a plan or purpose to\n“affec[t] commerce . . . by robbery or extortion,” or to vio-\nlence (2) that furthers a plan or purpose simply to “affec[t]\ncommerce”? We believe the former, more restrictive,\nreading of the text—the reading that ties the violence to\nrobbery or extortion—is correct.\n  For one thing, the language of the statute makes the\nmore restrictive reading the more natural one. The text\nthat precedes the physical violence clause does not forbid\nobstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce (or the move-\nment of any article or commodity in commerce); rather, it\nforbids obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce “by\nrobbery or extortion.” Ibid. (emphasis added). This lan-\nguage means that behavior that obstructs, delays, or\naffects commerce is a “violation” of the statute only if that\nbehavior also involves robbery or extortion (or related\nattempts or conspiracies). Consequently, the reference in\nthe physical violence clause to actions or threats of vio-\n6   SCHEIDLER v. NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN, \n\n                           INC.                             \n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n\nlence “in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything\nin violation of this section” (emphasis added) would seem\nto mean acts or threats of violence in furtherance of a plan\nor purpose to engage in robbery or extortion, for that is the\nonly kind of behavior that the section otherwise makes a\nviolation.\n   This restrictive reading is further supported by the fact\nthat Congress often intends such statutory terms as “af-\nfect commerce” or “in commerce” to be read as terms of art\nconnecting the congressional exercise of legislative author-\nity with the constitutional provision (here, the Commerce\nClause) that grants Congress that authority. See Allied-\nBruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265, 273 (1995);\nRussell v. United States, 471 U. S. 858, 859 (1985). Such\njurisdictional language may limit, but it will not primarily\ndefine, the behavior that the statute calls a “violation” of\nfederal law. Cf. Jones v. United States, 529 U. S. 848, 854\n(2000) (holding that by using the term “affecting . . . com-\nmerce,” “ ‘Congress did not define the crime described in\n[18 U. S. C.] §844(i) as the explosion of a building whose\ndamage or destruction might affect interstate commerce,’ ”\nand noting that the Court must look to other “qualifying\nlanguage” in the provision to define the offense).\n   For another thing, the statute’s history supports the more\nrestrictive reading. Congress enacted the Hobbs Act’s\npredecessor in 1934. See Anti-Racketeering Act, ch. 569,\n48 Stat. 979 (reproduced in Appendix, infra). That prede-\ncessor Act prohibited coercion and extortion appropriately\nconnected with interstate commerce, and placed these\nprohibitions in §§2(a) and 2(b), respectively. 48 Stat. 980.\nThe Act went on in §2(c) to impose criminal liability on\nanyone who, in connection with interstate commerce,\n“[c]ommits or threatens to commit an act of physical vio-\nlence or physical injury to a person or property in further-\nance of a plan or purpose to violate sections (a) or (b).”\nIbid.; see also NOW II, 537 U. S., at 407. The 1934 Act\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexplicitly linked §2(c), the physical violence subsection,\nwith §§2(a) and 2(b). It thereby made crystal clear that\nthe physical violence that it prohibited was not violence in\nfurtherance of a plan to injure commerce, but violence in\nfurtherance of a plan to injure commerce through coercion\nor extortion.\n   In 1946, Congress enacted a superseding law, namely,\nthe Hobbs Act. Ch. 537, 60 Stat. 420 (reproduced in Ap-\npendix, infra). The new law changed the old law in two\nsignificant respects: It added robbery while omitting coer-\ncion. NOW II, supra, at 407; see United States v. Culbert,\n435 U. S. 371, 377 (1978) (“The bill that eventually became\nthe Hobbs Act . . . substituted specific prohibitions against\nrobbery and extortion for the Anti-Racketeering Act’s lan-\nguage”). The new Act, like the old Act, was absolutely\nexplicit in respect to the point here at issue, the necessary\nlink between physical violence and other crimes (now\nextortion and robbery).\n   The 1946 Hobbs Act reads as follows:\n       “SEC. 2. Whoever in any way or degree obstructs,\n    delays, or affects commerce, or the movement of any\n    article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or ex-\n    tortion, shall be guilty of a felony.\n       “SEC. 3. Whoever conspires with another or with\n    others, or acts in concert with another or with others\n    to do anything in violation of section 2 shall be guilty\n    of a felony.\n       “SEC. 4. Whoever attempts or participates in an at-\n    tempt to do anything in violation of section 2 shall be\n    guilty of a felony.\n       “SEC. 5. Whoever commits or threatens physical vio-\n    lence to any person or property in furtherance of a\n    plan or purpose to do anything in violation of section 2\n    shall be guilty of a felony.” 60 Stat. 420 (emphasis\n    added).\n8   SCHEIDLER v. NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN, \n\n                           INC.                             \n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n\nAs §2 makes clear, the statute prohibits robbery and extor-\ntion. As §5’s reference to §2 makes clear, the statute\nprohibits violence only when that violence furthers a plan\nor purpose to affect commerce by robbery or extortion.\nEach of the statute’s other sections reflects the same\napproach; each explicitly refers back to §2’s prohibition\nagainst robbery and extortion.\n   The Act’s legislative history contains nothing to the\ncontrary. Indeed, the Committee Reports and floor de-\nbates emphasized that “the purpose of the bill was ‘to\nprevent anyone from obstructing, delaying, or affecting\ncommerce, or the movement of any article or commodity in\ncommerce by robbery or extortion as defined in the bill.’ ”\nCulbert, supra, at 377 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 238, 79th\nCong., 1st Sess., 9 (1945); emphasis added in Culbert); see\nCulbert, supra, at 376–378 (discussing legislative history).\nThey nowhere suggested that Congress intended to make\nphysical violence a freestanding crime.\n   The present Hobbs Act language is less clear than the\n1946 version. But the linguistic changes do not reflect a\ncongressional effort to redefine the crime. To the contrary,\nCongress revised the Hobbs Act’s language in 1948 as part\nof its general revision of the Criminal Code. That “1948\nRevision was not intended to create new crimes but to\nrecodify those then in existence.” Morissette v. United\nStates, 342 U. S. 246, 269, n. 28 (1952). This Court has\nwritten that it will “not presume that the revision worked a\nchange in the underlying substantive law ‘unless an intent\nto make such [a] change[e] is clearly expressed.’ ” Keene\nCorp. v. United States, 508 U. S. 200, 209 (1993) (alteration\nmade in Keene; quoting Fourco Glass Co. v. Transmirra\nProducts Corp., 353 U. S. 222, 227 (1957)). And here there\nis no evidence of any such intent. Rather, the Reviser’s\nNotes indicate that the linguistic changes to the Hobbs Act\nsimply amount to “changes in phraseology and arrangement\nnecessary to effect consolidation.” H. R. Rep. No. 304, 80th\n                  Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCong., 1st Sess., A131 (1947).\n   Finally, respondents’ Hobbs Act interpretation broadens\nthe Act’s scope well beyond what case law has assumed. It\nwould federalize much ordinary criminal behavior, ranging\nfrom simple assault to murder, behavior that typically is\nthe subject of state, not federal, prosecution. Decisions of\nthis Court have assumed that Congress did not intend the\nHobbs Act to have so broad a reach. See NOW II, 537 U. S.,\nat 405 (noting that the Hobbs Act embodied extortion,\nwhich required the obtaining of property, not coercion); id.,\nat 411 (GINSBURG, J., concurring) (coercion, which is not\ncovered by the Hobbs Act, “more accurately describes the\nnature of petitioners’ [non-property-related] actions” (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. Enmons,\n410 U. S. 396, 410 (1973) (Hobbs Act does not reach violent\nactivity by union members seeking higher wages because\nsuch violence is not extortion and Congress did not intend\nto “cover all overtly coercive conduct in the course of” a\nlabor dispute).\n   Not surprisingly, other Courts of Appeals that have\nconsidered the question have rejected respondents’ con-\nstruction of the Act. See United States v. Yankowski, 184\nF. 3d 1071 (CA9 1999); United States v. Franks, 511 F. 2d\n25 (CA6 1975). And in 1994, Congress enacted a specific\nstatute aimed directly at the type of abortion clinic violence\nand other activity at issue in this litigation, thereby sug-\ngesting it did not believe that the Hobbs Act already ad-\ndressed that activity. See Freedom of Access to Clinic\nEntrances Act, 18 U. S. C. §248(a)(3) (imposing criminal\nliability on anyone who “intentionally damages or destroys\nthe property of a facility, or attempts to do so, because such\nfacility provides reproductive health services”).\n                            III\n  Respondents’ contrary claim rests primarily upon a\ncanon of statutory construction that favors interpretations\n10   SCHEIDLER v. NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN,\n                            INC.\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat give a function to each word in a statute, thereby\navoiding linguistic superfluity. See United States v. Me-\nnasche, 348 U. S. 528, 538–539 (1955) (“It is our duty ‘to\ngive effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a stat-\nute’ ” (quoting Montclair v. Ramsdell, 107 U. S. 147, 152\n(1883))). They claim that, because the definitions of rob-\nbery or extortion (or related attempts or conspiracies)\nalready encompass robbery or extortion that takes place\nthrough acts of violence (or related threats), “[t]here would\nbe no reason for the statute to include the clause prohibit-\ning violence and threats of violence” unless Congress\nintended to create a freestanding offense. Brief for Re-\nspondents 25; see 18 U. S. C. §1951(b)(1) (defining “rob-\nbery” as the “unlawful taking or obtaining of personal\nproperty . . . by means of actual or threatened force, or\nviolence” (emphasis added)); §1951(b)(2) (defining “extor-\ntion” as “the obtaining of property from another . . . by\nwrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear”\n(emphasis added)).\n   Petitioners, however, have found a small amount of\nadditional work for the words to do. Brief for Petitioners\nScheidler et al. 33–36; see also Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 11–12. The Scheidler petitioners point to a\nhypothetical mobster who threatens violence and demands\npayment from a business. Those threats constitute at-\ntempted extortion; but the subsequent acts of violence\nagainst a noncomplying business by the subordinates of\nthat mobster may not constitute attempted extortion and\nmay not be punishable as a conspiracy to commit extortion\nif the subordinates were not privy to the mobster’s plan. A\nspecific prohibition of physical violence in furtherance of a\nplan to commit extortion would bring the subordinates’\nbehavior within the statute’s coverage. The United States\nadds that the physical violence clause permits prosecutors\nto bring multiple charges for the same conduct. For in-\nstance, the clause would apply to a defendant who injured\n                 Cite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbystanders during a robbery, permitting the Government\nto charge that defendant with the Hobbs Act crime of\nrobbery and the separate Hobbs Act crime of using vio-\nlence in furtherance of the robbery. Tr. of Oral Arg. 22.\n  We concede that this additional work is small. But the\nneed for language to cover such instances, or perhaps\nsimply a desire to emphasize the problem of violence, led\nCongress in the original 1946 version of the Hobbs Act to\nmake clear that the statute prohibited, not all physical\nviolence, but only physical violence in furtherance of a\nplan or purpose to engage in robbery or extortion. See\nsupra, at 7–8. And it is similarly clear that Congress\nintended to carry this view forward into the 1948 recodifi-\ncation. See supra, at 8–9. The canons of interpretation\ncannot lead us to a contrary conclusion. Those canons are\ntools designed to help courts better determine what Con-\ngress intended, not to lead courts to interpret the law\ncontrary to that intent. Chickasaw Nation v. United\nStates, 534 U. S. 84, 94 (2001) (noting that “canons are not\nmandatory rules” but guides “designed to help judges\ndetermine the Legislature’s intent,” and that “other cir-\ncumstances evidencing congressional intent can overcome\ntheir force”).\n                             IV\n   We conclude that Congress did not intend to create a\nfreestanding physical violence offense in the Hobbs Act. It\ndid intend to forbid acts or threats of physical violence in\nfurtherance of a plan or purpose to engage in what the\nstatute refers to as robbery or extortion (and related at-\ntempts or conspiracies). The judgment of the Court of\nAppeals is reversed, and the cases are remanded for entry\nof judgment for petitioners.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n  JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of these cases.\n12   SCHEIDLER v.
