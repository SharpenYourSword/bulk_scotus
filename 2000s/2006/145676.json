Wolf,</i> by appointment of the Court, 546 U.S. 974, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was <i>J. Kevin Hunt.</i><sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Respondent Randy Lee Guzek was found guilty of capital murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but vacated the sentence and ordered a new sentencing proceeding. The question before the Court is whether the State may limit the innocence-related evidence he can introduce at that proceeding to the evidence he introduced at his original trial. We hold that the limitation does not violate the Constitution.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Oregon tried Guzek for the offense of capital murder. The evidence showed that Guzek and two associates decided to burglarize the Houser family home, that they entered the house, that an associate killed Rod Houser, and that Guzek then robbed and killed Lois Houser. After the police <span class=\"star-pagination\">*520</span> learned that Guzek held a special grudge against the Housers, they traced him and his associates. The associates confessed. And they testified at trial, painting Guzek as the ringleader.</p>\n<p>Guzek's defense rested in part upon an alibi. He presented two alibi witnesses, his grandfather and his mother, who testified that Guzek had been with the one or the other at the time of the crime. The jury disbelieved the alibi, it convicted Guzek, and it sentenced him to death.</p>\n<p>Guzek appealed; the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed the conviction; but the court ordered a new sentencing proceeding. Guzek was again sentenced to death; he again appealed; and the Oregon Supreme Court again ordered resentencing. Guzek was sentenced to death for the third time; he again appealed; and yet again the Oregon Supreme Court found the sentencing procedures faulty. 336 Ore. 424, 86 P. 3d 1106 (2004). Seeking to avoid further errors at the next (the fourth) sentencing proceeding, the Oregon Supreme Court also addressed the admissibility of certain evidence Guzek seeks to introduce at that proceeding, including live testimony from his mother about his alibi.</p>\n<p>The Oregon Supreme Court held that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments provide Guzek a federal constitutional right to introduce this evidence at his upcoming sentencing proceeding. At Oregon's request, we agreed to review that determination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Before turning to the merits of Oregon's claim, we consider a motion that Guzek made, asking us to dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted. The motion rests upon Guzek's claim that, irrespective of federal law, <i>state</i> law gives him the right to introduce his mother's live testimony\u0097the additional alibi evidence here at issue. See Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 138.012(2)(b) (2003). For this reason, he says, the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear this appeal, or, at the least, there is no good practical reason for us to decide the federal issue.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*521</span> We cannot agree, however, that we lack jurisdiction to hear the case. We possess jurisdiction to review state-court determinations that rest upon federal law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257(a). And the Oregon Supreme Court here based its legal conclusion in relevant part on federal law. The court pointed out that <i>state</i> law permits the introduction (at a new sentencing hearing) of \"`evidence . . . <i>relevant</i> to [the] sentence including . . . mitigating evidence <i>relevant</i> to . . . [w]hether the defendant should receive a death sentence.'\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 45 (quoting Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 163.150(1)(a), (b) (2003); emphasis added and deleted). But it immediately added that the state law's words \"relevant . . . mitigating evidence\" refer (in the present context) only to evidence that the <i>Federal Constitution</i> grants a defendant the right to present. App. to Pet. for Cert. 45-52.</p>\n<p>The Oregon court went on to discuss this Court's statements to the effect that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments \"`require that the sentencer . . . not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor . . . any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 54 (quoting <i>Lockett</i> v. <i>Ohio,</i> 438 U.S. 586, 604 (1978) (plurality opinion); emphasis deleted); cf. App. to Pet. for Cert. 56 (recognizing that this aspect of <i>Lockett</i> was adopted by a majority of the Court in <i>Eddings</i> v. <i>Oklahoma,</i> 455 U.S. 104, 110 (1982)). And the Oregon court then interpreted this Court's holding in <i>Green</i> v. <i>Georgia,</i> 442 U.S. 95 (1979) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> as including, within that federal admissibility requirement, evidence which, like the proffered alibi testimony, tends to show that the defendant did not commit the crime for which he has been convicted. Thus, it held that state law demanded \"admissibility\" solely for a federal reason. And we possess jurisdiction. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>South Dakota</i> v. <i>Neville,</i> 459 U.S. 553, 556, n. 5 (1983); <i>Delaware</i> v. <i>Prouse,</i> 440 U.S. 648, 651-653 (1979).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*522</span> Neither are we persuaded by Guzek's argument that we should dismiss the case because irrespective of federal law and irrespective of the Oregon Supreme Court's federal holding, Oregon law gives him the right to introduce witnesses who testified at the guilt phase; and his mother was such a witness (a fact, he says, that the Oregon Supreme Court overlooked). Guzek points in support to an Oregon capital-case resentencing statute that says,</p>\n<blockquote>\"[a] transcript of all testimony and all exhibits and other evidence properly admitted in the prior trial . . . are admissible in the new sentencing proceeding.\" Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 138.012(2)(b) (2003).</blockquote>\n<p>The provision adds that,</p>\n<blockquote>\"[e]ither party may recall any witness who testified at the prior trial . . . and may present additional relevant evidence.\" <i>Ibid.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We do not doubt that these provisions give Guzek the state-law right to introduce a <i>transcript</i> of guilt-phase testimony. App. to Pet. for Cert. 43 (authorizing introduction of transcript of Guzek's grandfather's alibi testimony). But Guzek wishes to do more than introduce a <i>transcript</i> of his mother's alibi evidence; he wishes to call his mother to the stand as a live witness and elicit <i>additional</i> alibi testimony. Tr. of Oral Arg. 37-39, 41, 55-56. The Oregon statute quoted above does not expressly say whether he may do so. It does give him the right to \"recall any witness\" who testified at the first trial and to \"present additional <i>relevant</i> evidence.\" (Emphasis added.) But is this additional evidence \"relevant\"? The Oregon Supreme Court thought so, but only because <i>federal</i> law insists upon its relevance. And its opinion suggests that, in the absence of federal compulsion, it would not fall within the scope of the state statutory word \"relevant.\" See <i>supra,</i> at 521.</p>\n<p>At most, Guzek has shown that state law <i>might,</i> not that it <i>does,</i> independently give him the right to introduce this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*523</span> evidence. We have made clear that \"a <i>possible</i> adequate and independent state ground\" for a decision does not \"bar [our] reaching the federal questions\" where, as here, a \"State Supreme Court quite clearly rested its [decision] solely on the Federal Constitution.\" <i>California</i> v. <i>Ramos,</i> 463 U.S. 992, 997, n. 7 (1983); see also <i>City of Revere</i> v. <i>Massachusetts Gen. Hospital,</i> 463 U.S. 239, 242 (1983); <i>United Air Lines, Inc.</i> v. <i>Mahin,</i> 410 U.S. 623, 630-631 (1973). And we consequently deny the motion to dismiss the writ.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>As our discussion in Part II, <i>supra,</i> makes clear, the federal question before us is a narrow one. Do the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments grant Guzek a constitutional right to present evidence of the kind he seeks to introduce, namely, <i>new</i> evidence that shows he was not present at the scene of the crime. That evidence is <i>inconsistent</i> with Guzek's prior conviction. It sheds no light on <i>the manner</i> in which he committed the crime for which he has been convicted. Nor is it evidence that Guzek contends was unavailable to him at the time of the original trial. And, to the extent it is evidence he introduced at that time, he is free to introduce it now, albeit in transcript form. Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 138.012(2)(b) (2003). We can find nothing in the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments that provides a capital defendant a right to introduce new evidence of this kind at sentencing.</p>\n<p>We cannot agree with the Oregon Supreme Court that our previous cases have found in the Eighth Amendment a constitutional right broad enough to encompass the evidence here at issue. In <i>Lockett</i> v. <i>Ohio, supra</i><i>,</i> a plurality of this Court decided that a defendant convicted of acting in concert with others to rob and to kill could introduce at the sentencing stage evidence that she had played a minor role in the crime, indeed, that she had remained outside the shop (where the killing took place) at the time of the crime. A plurality of the Court wrote that,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*524</span> \"the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the sentencer . . . not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's character or record and <i>any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers</i> as a basis for a sentence less than death.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 604 (emphasis added and deleted).</blockquote>\n<p>And in <i>Eddings</i> v. <i>Oklahoma,</i> 455 U.S. 104, the Court majority adopted this statement. See also <i>McCleskey</i> v. <i>Kemp,</i> 481 U.S. 279, 306 (1987); <i>Bell</i> v. <i>Ohio,</i> 438 U.S. 637, 642 (1978) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p>But the evidence at issue in these cases was traditional sentence-related evidence, evidence that tended to show <i>how,</i> not <i>whether,</i> the defendant committed the crime. Nor was the evidence directly inconsistent with the jury's finding of guilt.</p>\n<p>The Oregon Supreme Court thought that this latter distinction\u0097the fact that the \"alibi evidence was inconsistent with,\" rather than \"consistent with[,] the underlying convictions\"\u0097did not matter. App. to Pet. for Cert. 58. It said that this \"factual distinction . . . is of no consequence in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Green</i> v. <i>Georgia</i><i>.\" Ibid.</i> In <i>Green,</i> however, the Court focused upon a defendant convicted of murder, who sought to introduce at sentencing a statement his confederate made to a third party that he (the confederate) had alone committed the murder (<i>i. e.,</i> without the defendant). The State opposed its use at the defendant's sentencing hearing <i>on the ground that, as to the defendant, it was hearsay.</i> The Court, in a brief <i>per curiam</i> opinion, noted that the State had used the confession in the confederate's trial, referred to an earlier case holding that the Constitution prohibits States from \"`mechanistically'\" applying the hearsay rule \"`to defeat the ends of justice,'\" and held that the Constitution prohibited the State from barring use of the confession. 442 U.S., at 97 (quoting <i>Chambers</i> v. <i>Mississippi,</i> 410 U.S. 284, 302 (1973)). The opinion focused only upon the hearsay problem, and it implicitly assumed that, in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*525</span> the absence of the hearsay problem, <i>state</i> law would not have blocked admission of the evidence.</p>\n<p>In any event, subsequent to <i>Green,</i> this Court decided <i>Franklin</i> v. <i>Lynaugh,</i> 487 U.S. 164 (1988), and that case makes clear, contrary to the Oregon Supreme Court's understanding, that this Court's previous cases had <i>not</i> interpreted the Eighth Amendment as providing a capital defendant the right to introduce at sentencing evidence designed to cast \"residual doubt\" on his guilt of the basic crime of conviction. The <i>Franklin</i> plurality said it was \"quite doubtful\" that any such right existed. <i>Id.,</i> at 173, n. 6. And two other Members of the Court added that \"[o]ur cases\" do not support any such \"right to reconsideration by the sentencing body of lingering doubts about . . . guilt.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 187 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). See also <i>Penry</i> v. <i>Lynaugh,</i> 492 U.S. 302, 320 (1989) (characterizing <i>Franklin</i> as a case in which a majority \"agreed that `residual doubt' as to Franklin's guilt was not a constitutionally mandated mitigating factor\" (brackets omitted)).</p>\n<p><i>Franklin</i> did not resolve whether the Eighth Amendment affords capital defendants such a right, for the plurality held that the sentencing scheme at issue was constitutional \"even if such a right existed.\" 487 U.S., at 174. But the Court's statements on the matter make clear that the Oregon Supreme Court erred in interpreting <i>Green</i> as providing a capital defendant with a constitutional right to introduce residual doubt evidence at sentencing.</p>\n<p>In this case, we once again face a situation where we need not resolve whether such a right exists, for, even if it does, it could not extend so far as to provide this defendant with a right to introduce the evidence at issue. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Alabama State Federation of Labor</i> v. <i>McAdory,</i> 325 U.S. 450, 461-462 (1945). The Eighth Amendment insists upon \"`reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case.'\" <i>Penry, supra,</i> at 328 (quoting <i>Woodson</i> v. <i>North Carolina,</i> 428 U.S. 280, 305 (1976) (plurality <span class=\"star-pagination\">*526</span> opinion)). The Eighth Amendment also insists that a sentencing jury be able \"to consider and give effect to mitigating evidence\" about the defendant's \"character or record or the circumstances of the offense.\" <i>Penry, supra,</i> at 327-328. But the Eighth Amendment does not deprive the State of its authority to set reasonable limits upon the evidence a defendant can submit, and to control the manner in which it is submitted. Rather, \"States are free to structure and shape consideration of mitigating evidence `in an effort to achieve a more rational and equitable administration of the death penalty.'\" <i>Boyde</i> v. <i>California,</i> 494 U.S. 370, 377 (1990) (quoting <i>Franklin, supra,</i> at 181 (plurality opinion)); see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Johnson</i> v. <i>Texas,</i> 509 U.S. 350, 362 (1993); <i>California</i> v. <i>Brown,</i> 479 U.S. 538, 543 (1987).</p>\n<p>Three circumstances, taken together, convince us that the State possesses the authority to regulate, through exclusion, the evidence that Guzek seeks to present. First, sentencing traditionally concerns <i>how,</i> not <i>whether,</i> a defendant committed the crime. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1A1.1, editorial note, \u00a7 4(a), p. 4 (Nov. 2004). But the evidence at issue here\u0097alibi evidence\u0097concerns only <i>whether,</i> not <i>how,</i> he did so.</p>\n<p>Second, the parties previously litigated the issue to which the evidence is relevant\u0097whether the defendant committed the basic crime. The evidence thereby attacks a previously determined matter in a proceeding at which, in principle, that matter is not at issue. The law typically discourages collateral attacks of this kind. Cf. <i>Allen</i> v. <i>McCurry,</i> 449 U.S. 90, 94 (1980) (\"As this Court and other courts have often recognized, res judicata and collateral estoppel relieve parties of the cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources, and, by preventing inconsistent decisions, encourage reliance on adjudication\").</p>\n<p>Third, the negative impact of a rule restricting defendant's ability to introduce <i>new</i> alibi evidence is minimized by the fact that Oregon law gives the defendant the right to present <span class=\"star-pagination\">*527</span> to the sentencing jury <i>all</i> the evidence of innocence from the original trial regardless. That law permits the defendant to introduce at resentencing transcripts and exhibits from his prior trial. Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 138.012(2)(b) (2003). The defendant here has not claimed that the evidence at issue was unavailable at the time of his original trial. Thus, he need only have introduced it at that time to guarantee its presentation (albeit through transcripts) to a resentencing jury as well.</p>\n<p>The legitimacy of these trial management and evidentiary considerations, along with the typically minimal adverse impact that a restriction would have on a defendant's ability to present his alibi claim at resentencing convinces us that the Eighth Amendment does not protect defendant's right to present the evidence at issue here. We conclude that the Oregon court was wrong in holding to the contrary.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Guzek also contends that, even if the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments do not mandate the admission of his mother's testimony, he is entitled to introduce that evidence to impeach his associates, whose earlier testimony the government intends to introduce at resentencing. The Oregon Supreme Court did not address this issue; nor do we believe it fairly encompassed within the question presented. The Oregon courts are free to consider it on remand should they believe it appropriate to do so.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, we vacate the judgment of the Oregon Supreme Court, and we remand the case for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*528</span> JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>In this case, we have the opportunity to put to rest, once and for all, the mistaken notion that the Eighth Amendment requires that a convicted capital defendant be given the opportunity, at his sentencing hearing, to present evidence and argument concerning residual doubts about his guilt. Although the Court correctly holds that there is no Eighth Amendment violation in this case, I would follow the Court's logic to its natural conclusion and reject all Eighth Amendment residual-doubt claims.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that we have jurisdiction and should exercise it in this case. What requires me to withhold agreement to the Court's opinion is the last of the \"[t]hree circumstances\" on which it relies, <i>ante,</i> at 526\u0097 namely, \"the fact that Oregon law gives the defendant the right to present to the sentencing jury <i>all</i> the evidence of innocence from the original trial.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 526-527 (emphasis in original). The first two of the circumstances are alone sufficient to dispose of the claim that the Eighth Amendment guarantees a capital defendant a <i>second</i> opportunity, at sentencing, to litigate his innocence. In fact, the Court's third \"circumstance\" is an analytical misfit in the company of the other two. The first two\u0097that \"sentencing traditionally concerns <i>how,</i> not <i>whether,</i> a defendant committed the crime,\" <i>ante,</i> at 526, and that \"the parties previously litigated the issue to which the evidence is relevant,\" <i>ibid.</i>\u0097show that compelling the admission of innocence-related evidence would be <i>improper</i> and <i>unnecessary</i> at a sentencing hearing. The third, by contrast, suggests that there is no constitutional violation in this case because <i>enough</i> of such evidence may be admitted on remand. The latter factor would be relevant only if the former two were not.</p>\n<p>If we needed any third factor to justify our holding, a better candidate would be that the claim we consider here finds <span class=\"star-pagination\">*529</span> no support in our Nation's legal history and traditions. In 1986, Justice Marshall correctly observed that there had been \"few times in which any legitimacy has been given to the power of a convicted capital defendant facing the possibility of a death sentence to argue as a mitigating factor the chance that he might be innocent.\" <i>Lockhart</i> v. <i>McCree,</i> 476 U.S. 162, 205 (dissenting opinion). Nothing has changed on that score in the last 20 years. On the contrary, in <i>Franklin</i> v. <i>Lynaugh,</i> 487 U.S. 164 (1988), four Members of this Court noted that our \"prior decisions . . . fail to recognize a constitutional right to have such doubts considered as a mitigating factor,\" <i>id.,</i> at 174 (plurality opinion). They were, moreover, \"quite doubtful\" that the purported right existed, because it is \"arguably inconsistent with the common practice of allowing penalty-only trials on remand of cases where a death sentence\u0097but not the underlying conviction\u0097is struck down on appeal.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 173, n. 6. Two other Members of the Court would have rejected the claim outright. <i>Id.,</i> at 187 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>After <i>Franklin,</i> the lower courts have unanimously denied constitutional claims like the one we consider today. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Zeigler</i> v. <i>Crosby,</i> 345 F.3d 1300, 1310 (CA11 2003); <i>Evans</i> v. <i>Thompson,</i> 881 F. 2d 117, 121 (CA4 1989); <i>Duest</i> v. <i>State,</i> 855 So. 2d 33, 40-41 (Fla. 2003); <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Fisher,</i> 572 Pa. 105, 115-116, 813 A. 2d 761, 767 (2002); <i>People</i> v. <i>Emerson,</i> 189 Ill. 2d 436, 501-504, 727 N. E. 2d 302, 338-339 (2000); <i>State</i> v. <i>Fletcher,</i> 354 N. C. 455, 470-472, 555 S. E. 2d 534, 544 (2001); <i>Melson</i> v. <i>State,</i> 775 So. 2d 857, 898-899 (Ala. Crim. App. 1999). The last apparent scrap of authority for the contrary view came from our cryptic opinion in <i>Green</i> v. <i>Georgia,</i> 442 U.S. 95 (1979) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> on which the Oregon Supreme Court principally relied. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 58-62. The chief virtue of today's opinion lies in its discarding the notion that <i>Green</i> provides any support for an Eighth Amendment right to argue residual doubt at sentencing. See <i>ante,</i> at 524-525.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*530</span> In mentioning, however, the superfluous circumstance that Oregon law happens to provide for the admission at sentencing of <i>some</i> evidence that relates to innocence, the Court risks creating doubt where none should exist. Capital defendants might now be tempted to argue that the <i>amount</i> of residual-doubt evidence carried over from the guilt phase in their sentencing hearings is insufficient to satisfy the Court's third factor. Every one of these \"residual-doubt\" claims will be meritless in light of the Court's first two factors. We should make this perfectly clear today.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  A brief of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal was filed for the State of Alabama et al. by <i>Troy King,</i> Attorney General of Alabama, and <i>Kevin C.

Argued December 7, 2005\u2014Decided February 22, 2006\nAt the guilt phase of respondent Guzek\u2019s capital murder trial, his\n  mother was one of two witnesses who testified that he had been with\n  her on the night the crime was committed.

C. \u00a71257(a), and the\n Oregon Supreme Court based its legal conclusion in relevant part on\n such law. It pointed out that relevant mitigating evidence under\n state law refers only to evidence that the Federal Constitution grants\n a defendant the right to present. And it interpreted the federal ad-\n missibility requirement in Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (plural-\n ity opinion), and Green v. Georgia, 442 U. S. 95 (per curiam), to in-\n clude evidence like the proffered alibi testimony. Nor is this Court\n willing to dismiss the writ on the ground that irrespective of federal\n law and of the State Supreme Court\u2019s federal holding, Oregon\u2019s capi-\n tal-case resentencing statute gives Guzek the right to introduce wit-\n nesses who testified at the guilt phase. At most, state law might give\n him such a right, but \u201ca possible adequate and independent state\n2                           OREGON v.

S. 992, 997, n. 7. Pp. 2\u20135.\n       2. The Constitution does not prohibit a State from limiting the in-\n    nocence-related evidence a capital defendant can introduce at a sen-\n    tencing proceeding to the evidence introduced at the original trial.\n    This Court\u2019s cases have not interpreted the Eighth Amendment as\n    providing such a defendant the right to introduce at sentencing evi-\n    dence designed to cast \u201cresidual doubt\u201d on his guilt of the basic crime\n    of conviction. Franklin v. Lynaugh, 487 U. S. 164, 173, n. 6 (plurality\n    opinion). Lockett v. Ohio, supra, and Green v. Georgia, supra, distin-\n    guished. Even if such a right existed, it could not extend so far as to\n    provide Guzek with a right to introduce the evidence at issue. The\n    Eighth Amendment insists upon \u201c \u2018 reliability in the determination\n    that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case,\u2019 \u201d Penry v.\n    Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 328, and that a sentencing jury be able \u201cto\n    consider and give effect to mitigating evidence\u201d about the defendant\u2019s\n    \u201ccharacter or record or the circumstances of the offense,\u201d id., at 327\u2013\n    328, but it does not deprive the State of its authority to set reason-\n    able limits on the evidence a defendant can submit, and to control the\n    manner in which it is submitted. Three circumstances, taken to-\n    gether, show that the State has the authority to regulate Guzek\u2019s\n    evidence through exclusion. First, sentencing traditionally concerns\n    how, not whether, a defendant committed the crime, but alibi evi-\n    dence concerns only whether, not how, he did so. Second, the parties\n    previously litigated the issue to which the evidence is relevant. Thus,\n    the evidence attacks a previously determined matter in a proceeding\n    at which, in principle, that matter is not at issue. The law typically\n    discourages such collateral attacks. Cf. Allen v. McCurry, 449 U. S.\n    90, 94. Third, the negative impact of a rule restricting Guzek\u2019s abil-\n    ity to introduce new alibi evidence is minimized by the fact that Ore-\n    gon law gives the defendant the right to present to the sentencing\n    jury all the innocence evidence from the original trial (albeit through\n    transcripts). The Oregon courts are free to consider on remand\n    whether Guzek is entitled to introduce his mother\u2019s testimony to im-\n    peach other witnesses whose earlier testimony the government in-\n    tends to introduce at resentencing.

RANDY LEE GUZEK\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n                       OREGON\n                             [February 22, 2006]\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Respondent Randy Lee Guzek was found guilty of capi-\ntal murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, the Ore-\ngon Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but vacated\nthe sentence and ordered a new sentencing proceeding.\nThe question before the Court is whether the State may\nlimit the innocence-related evidence he can introduce at\nthat proceeding to the evidence he introduced at his origi-\nnal trial. We hold that the limitation does not violate the\nConstitution.\n                            I\n  Oregon tried Guzek for the offense of capital murder.\nThe evidence showed that Guzek and two associates de-\ncided to burglarize the Houser family home, that they\nentered the house, that an associate killed Rod Houser,\nand that Guzek then robbed and killed Lois Houser. After\nthe police learned that Guzek held a special grudge\nagainst the Housers, they traced him and his associates.\nThe associates confessed. And they testified at trial,\npainting Guzek as the ringleader.\n  Guzek\u2019s defense rested in part upon an alibi. He pre-\nsented two alibi witnesses, his grandfather and his\n2                    OREGON v. GUZEK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmother, who testified that Guzek had been with the one or\nthe other at the time of the crime. The jury disbelieved\nthe alibi, it convicted Guzek, and it sentenced him to\ndeath.\n  Guzek appealed; the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed\nthe conviction; but the court ordered a new sentencing\nproceeding. Guzek was again sentenced to death; he again\nappealed; and the Oregon Supreme Court again ordered\nresentencing. Guzek was sentenced to death for the third\ntime; he again appealed; and yet again the Oregon Su-\npreme Court found the sentencing procedures faulty.\nSeeking to avoid further errors at the next (the fourth)\nsentencing proceeding, the Oregon Supreme Court also\naddressed the admissibility of certain evidence Guzek\nseeks to introduce at that proceeding, including live testi-\nmony from his mother about his alibi.\n  The Oregon Supreme Court held that the Eighth and\nFourteenth Amendments provide Guzek a federal consti-\ntutional right to introduce this evidence at his upcoming\nsentencing proceeding. At Oregon\u2019s request, we agreed to\nreview that determination. 544 U. S. ___ (2005).\n                              II\n  Before turning to the merits of Oregon\u2019s claim, we con-\nsider a motion that Guzek made, asking us to dismiss the\nwrit of certiorari as improvidently granted. The motion\nrests upon Guzek\u2019s claim that, irrespective of federal law,\nstate law gives him the right to introduce his mother\u2019s live\ntestimony\u2014the additional alibi evidence here at issue.\nSee Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a7138.012(2)(b) (2003). For this reason,\nhe says, the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear this appeal,\nor, at the least, there is no good practical reason for us to\ndecide the federal issue.\n  We cannot agree, however, that we lack jurisdiction to\nhear the case. We possess jurisdiction to review state-\ncourt determinations that rest upon federal law. 28\n                  Cite as: 546 U.

And the Oregon Supreme Court here\nbased its legal conclusion in relevant part on federal law.\nThe court pointed out that state law permits the introduc-\ntion (at a new sentencing hearing) of \u201c \u2018evidence . . . rele-\nvant to [the] sentence including . . . mitigating evidence\nrelevant to . . . [w]hether the defendant should receive a\ndeath sentence.\u2019 \u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 45 (quoting Ore.\nRev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7163.150(1)(a), (b) (2003); emphasis added and\ndeleted). But it immediately added that the state law\u2019s\nwords \u201crelevant . . . mitigating evidence\u201d refer (in the\npresent context) only to evidence that the Federal Consti-\ntution grants a defendant the right to present. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 45\u201352.\n   The Oregon court went on to discuss this Court\u2019s state-\nments to the effect that the Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments \u201c \u2018require that the sentencer . . . not be pre-\ncluded from considering, as a mitigating factor . . . any of\nthe circumstances of the offense that the defendant prof-\nfers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 54\n(quoting Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (1978) (plurality\nopinion); emphasis deleted); cf. App. to Pet. for Cert. 56\n(recognizing that this aspect of Lockett was adopted by a\nmajority of the Court in Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S.\n104, 110 (1982)). And the Oregon court then interpreted\nthis Court\u2019s holding in Green v. Georgia, 442 U. S. 95 (1979)\n(per curiam), as including, within that federal admissibil-\nity requirement, evidence which, like the proffered alibi\ntestimony, tends to show that the defendant did not com-\nmit the crime for which he has been convicted. Thus, it\nheld that state law demanded \u201cadmissibility\u201d solely for a\nfederal reason. And we possess jurisdiction. See, e.g.,\nSouth Dakota v. Neville, 459 U. S. 553, 556, n. 5 (1983);\nDelaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S. 648, 651\u2013653 (1979).\n   Neither are we persuaded by Guzek\u2019s argument that we\nshould dismiss the case because irrespective of federal law\nand irrespective of the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s federal\n4                    OREGON v. GUZEK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nholding, Oregon law gives him the right to introduce wit-\nnesses who testified at the guilt phase; and his mother\nwas such a witness (a fact, he says, that the Oregon Su-\npreme Court overlooked). Guzek points in support to an\nOregon capital-case resentencing statute that says,\n    \u201c[a] transcript of all testimony and all exhibits and\n    other evidence properly admitted in the prior trial . . .\n    are admissible in the new sentencing proceeding.\u201d\n    Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a7138.012(2)(b) (2003).\nThe provision adds that,\n    \u201c[e]ither party may recall any witness who testified at\n    the prior trial . . . and may present additional relevant\n    evidence.\u201d Ibid.\nWe do not doubt that these provisions give Guzek the\nstate\u2013law right to introduce a transcript of guilt-phase\ntestimony. App. to Pet. for Cert. 43 (authorizing introduc-\ntion of transcript of Guzek\u2019s grandfather\u2019s alibi testimony).\nBut Guzek wishes to do more than introduce a transcript\nof his mother\u2019s alibi evidence; he wishes to call his mother\nto the stand as a live witness and elicit additional alibi\ntestimony. Tr. of Oral Arg. 37\u201339, 41, 55\u201356. The Oregon\nstatute quoted above does not expressly say whether he\nmay do so. It does give him the right to \u201crecall any wit-\nness\u201d who testified at the first trial and to \u201cpresent addi-\ntional relevant evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) But is this\nadditional evidence \u201crelevant\u201d? The Oregon Supreme\nCourt thought so, but only because federal law insists\nupon its relevance. And its opinion suggests that, in the\nabsence of federal compulsion, it would not fall within the\nscope of the state statutory word \u201crelevant.\u201d See supra, at\n3.\n   At most, Guzek has shown that state law might, not that\nit does, independently give him the right to introduce this\nevidence. We have made clear that \u201ca possible adequate\nand independent state ground\u201d for a decision does not \u201cbar\n                 Cite as: 546 U.

Ramos,\n463 U. S. 992, 997, n. 7 (1983); see also City of Revere v.\nMassachusetts Gen. Hospital, 463 U. S. 239, 242 (1983);\nUnited Air Lines, Inc. v. Mahin, 410 U. S. 623, 630\u2013631\n(1973). And we consequently deny the motion to dismiss the\nwrit.\n                             III\n   As our discussion in Part II, supra, makes clear, the\nfederal question before us is a narrow one. Do the Eighth\nand Fourteenth Amendments grant Guzek a constitu-\ntional right to present evidence of the kind he seeks to\nintroduce, namely new evidence that shows he was not\npresent at the scene of the crime. That evidence is incon-\nsistent with Guzek\u2019s prior conviction. It sheds no light on\nthe manner in which he committed the crime for which he\nhas been convicted. Nor is it evidence that Guzek con-\ntends was unavailable to him at the time of the original\ntrial. And, to the extent it is evidence he introduced at\nthat time, he is free to introduce it now, albeit in tran-\nscript form. Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a7138.012(2)(b) (2003). We can\nfind nothing in the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments\nthat provides a capital defendant a right to introduce new\nevidence of this kind at sentencing.\n   We cannot agree with the Oregon Supreme Court that\nour previous cases have found in the Eighth Amendment a\nconstitutional right broad enough to encompass the evi-\ndence here at issue. In Lockett v. Ohio, supra, a plurality\nof this Court decided that a defendant convicted of acting\nin concert with others to rob and to kill could introduce at\nthe sentencing stage evidence that she had played a minor\nrole in the crime, indeed, that she had remained outside\nthe shop (where the killing took place) at the time of the\ncrime. A plurality of the Court wrote that,\n6                     OREGON v. GUZEK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    \u201cthe Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that\n    the sentencer . . . not be precluded from considering,\n    as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant\u2019s\n    character or record and any of the circumstances of the\n    offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sen-\n    tence less than death.\u201d Id., at 604 (emphasis added\n    and deleted).\nAnd in Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, the Court\nmajority adopted this statement. See also McCleskey v.\nKemp, 481 U. S. 279, 306 (1987); Bell v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 637,\n642 (1978) (plurality opinion).\n    But the evidence at issue in these cases was traditional\nsentence-related evidence, evidence that tended to show\nhow, not whether, the defendant committed the crime.\nNor was the evidence directly inconsistent with the jury\u2019s\nfinding of guilt.\n    The Oregon Supreme Court thought that this latter\ndistinction\u2014the fact that the \u201calibi evidence was inconsis-\ntent with,\u201d rather than \u201cconsistent with[,] the underlying\nconvictions\u201d\u2014did not matter. App. to Pet. for Cert. 58. It\nsaid that this \u201cfactual distinction . . . is of no consequence\nin light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Green v. Geor-\ngia.\u201d Ibid. In Green, however, the Court focused upon a\ndefendant convicted of murder, who sought to introduce at\nsentencing a statement his confederate made to a third\nparty that he (the confederate) had alone committed the\nmurder (i.e., without the defendant). The State opposed\nits use at the defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing on the\nground that, as to the defendant, it was hearsay. The\nCourt, in a brief per curiam opinion, noted that the State\nhad used the confession in the confederate\u2019s trial, referred\nto an earlier case holding that the Constitution forbids\nStates from \u201c \u2018mechanistically\u2019 \u201d applying the hearsay rule\n\u201c \u2018to defeat the ends of justice,\u2019 \u201d and held that the Consti-\ntution prohibited the State from barring use of the confes-\n                 Cite as: 546 U.

The opinion focused only upon the\nhearsay problem, and it implicitly assumed that, in the\nabsence of the hearsay problem, state law would not have\nblocked admission of the evidence.\n   In any event, subsequent to Green, this Court decided\nFranklin v. Lynaugh, 487 U. S. 164 (1988) (plurality opin-\nion), and that case makes clear, contrary to the Oregon\nSupreme Court\u2019s understanding, that this Court\u2019s previous\ncases had not interpreted the Eighth Amendment as pro-\nviding a capital defendant the right to introduce at sen-\ntencing evidence designed to cast \u201cresidual doubt\u201d on his\nguilt of the basic crime of conviction. The Franklin plural-\nity said it was \u201cquite doubtful\u201d that any such right existed.\nId., at 173, n. 6. And two other Members of the Court\nadded that \u201c[o]ur cases\u201d do not support any such \u201cright to\nreconsideration by the sentencing body of lingering doubts\nabout . . . guilt.\u201d Id., at 187 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in\njudgment). See also Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 320\n(1989) (characterizing Franklin as a case in which a major-\nity \u201cagreed that \u2018residual doubt\u2019 as to Franklin\u2019s guilt was\nnot a constitutionally mandated mitigating factor\u201d (brack-\nets omitted)).\n   Franklin did not resolve whether the Eighth Amend-\nment affords capital defendants such a right, for the plu-\nrality held that the sentencing scheme at issue was consti-\ntutional \u201ceven if such a right existed.\u201d 487 U. S., at 174.\nBut the Court\u2019s statements on the matter make clear that\nthe Oregon Supreme Court erred in interpreting Green as\nproviding a capital defendant with a constitutional right to\nintroduce residual doubt evidence at sentencing.\n   In this case, we once again face a situation where we\nneed not resolve whether such a right exists, for, even if it\ndoes, it could not extend so far as to provide this defendant\nwith a right to introduce the evidence at issue. See, e.g.,\nAlabama State Federation of Labor v. McAdory, 325 U. S.\n8                     OREGON v. GUZEK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n450, 461\u2013462 (1945). The Eighth Amendment insists upon\n\u201c \u2018reliability in the determination that death is the appro-\npriate punishment in a specific case.\u2019 \u201d Penry, supra, at 328\n(quoting Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 305\n(1976) (plurality opinion)). The Eighth Amendment also\ninsists that a sentencing jury be able \u201cto consider and give\neffect to mitigating evidence\u201d about the defendant\u2019s \u201cchar-\nacter or record or the circumstances of the offense.\u201d Penry,\nsupra, at 327\u2013328. But the Eighth Amendment does not\ndeprive the State of its authority to set reasonable limits\nupon the evidence a defendant can submit, and to control\nthe manner in which it is submitted. Rather, \u201cStates are\nfree to structure and shape consideration of mitigating\nevidence \u2018in an effort to achieve a more rational and equita-\nble administration of the death penalty.\u2019 \u201d Boyde v. Califor-\nnia, 494 U. S. 370, 377 (1990) (quoting Franklin, supra, at\n181 (plurality opinion)); see, e.g., Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S.\n350, 362 (1993); California v. Brown, 479 U. S. 538, 543\n(1987).\n    Three circumstances, taken together, convince us that\nthe State possesses the authority to regulate, through\nexclusion, the evidence that Guzek seeks to present. First,\nsentencing traditionally concerns how, not whether, a\ndefendant committed the crime. See United States Sen-\ntencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a71A1.1, editorial\nnote, \u00a74(a), p. 4 (Nov. 2004). But the evidence at issue\nhere\u2014alibi evidence\u2014concerns only whether, not how, he\ndid so.\n    Second, the parties previously litigated the issue to\nwhich the evidence is relevant\u2014whether the defendant\ncommitted the basic crime. The evidence thereby attacks\na previously determined matter in a proceeding at which,\nin principle, that matter is not at issue. The law typically\ndiscourages collateral attacks of this kind. Cf. Allen v.\nMcCurry, 449 U. S. 90, 94 (1980) (\u201cAs this Court and other\ncourts have often recognized, res judicata and collateral\n                 Cite as: 546 U.

That law permits\nthe defendant to introduce at resentencing transcripts and\nexhibits from his prior trial. Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a7138.012(2)(b)\n(2003). The defendant here has not claimed that the\nevidence at issue was unavailable at the time of his origi-\nnal trial. Thus, he need only have introduced it at that\ntime to guarantee its presentation (albeit through tran-\nscripts) to a resentencing jury as well.\n   The legitimacy of these trial management and eviden-\ntiary considerations, along with the typically minimal\nadverse impact that a restriction would have on a defen-\ndant\u2019s ability to present his alibi claim at resentencing\nconvinces us that the Eighth Amendment does not protect\ndefendant\u2019s right to present the evidence at issue here.\nWe conclude that the Oregon court was wrong in holding\nto the contrary.\n                            IV\n  Guzek also contends that, even if the Eighth and Four-\nteenth Amendments do not mandate the admission of his\nmother\u2019s testimony, he is entitled to introduce that evi-\ndence to impeach his associates, whose earlier testimony\nthe government intends to introduce at resentencing. The\nOregon Supreme Court did not address this issue; nor do\nwe believe it fairly encompassed within the question pre-\nsented.

RANDY LEE GUZEK\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n                       OREGON\n                      [February 22, 2006]\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\nconcurring in the judgment.\n   In this case, we have the opportunity to put to rest, once\nfor all, the mistaken notion that the Eighth Amendment\nrequires that a convicted capital defendant be given the\nopportunity, at his sentencing hearing, to present evidence\nand argument concerning residual doubts about his guilt.\nAlthough the Court correctly holds that there is no Eighth\nAmendment violation in this case, I would follow the\nCourt\u2019s logic to its natural conclusion and reject all Eighth\nAmendment residual-doubt claims.\n   I agree with the Court that we have jurisdiction and\nshould exercise it in this case. What requires me to with-\nhold agreement to the Court\u2019s opinion is the last of the\n\u201c[t]hree circumstances\u201d on which it relies, ante, at 8\u20139\u2014\nnamely, \u201cthe fact that Oregon law gives the defendant the\nright to present to the sentencing jury all the evidence of\ninnocence from the original trial.\u201d Ante, at 9 (emphasis in\noriginal). The first two of the circumstances are alone\nsufficient to dispose of the claim that the Eighth Amend-\nment guarantees a capital defendant a second opportunity,\nat sentencing, to litigate his innocence. In fact, the\nCourt\u2019s third \u201ccircumstance\u201d is an analytical misfit in the\ncompany of the other two. The first two\u2014that \u201csentencing\ntraditionally concerns how, not whether, a defendant\ncommitted the crime,\u201d ante, at 8, and that \u201cthe parties\n2                     OREGON v. GUZEK\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\npreviously litigated the issue to which the evidence is\nrelevant,\u201d ibid.\u2014show that compelling the admission of\ninnocence-related evidence would be improper and unnec-\nessary at a sentencing hearing. The third, by contrast,\nsuggests that there is no constitutional violation in this\ncase because enough of such evidence may be admitted on\nremand. The latter factor would be relevant only if the\nformer two were not.\n   If we needed any third factor to justify our holding, a\nbetter candidate would be that the claim we consider here\nfinds no support in our Nation\u2019s legal history and tradi-\ntions. In 1986, Justice Marshall correctly observed that\nthere had been \u201cfew times in which any legitimacy has\nbeen given to the power of a convicted capital defendant\nfacing the possibility of a death sentence to argue as a\nmitigating factor the chance that he might be innocent.\u201d\nLockhart v. McCree, 476 U. S. 162, 205 (dissenting opin-\nion). Nothing has changed on that score in the last 20\nyears. On the contrary, in Franklin v. Lynaugh, 487 U. S.\n164 (1988), four Members of this Court noted that our\n\u201cprior decisions . . . fail to recognize a constitutional right\nto have such doubts considered as a mitigating factor,\u201d id.,\nat 174 (plurality opinion). They were, moreover, \u201cquite\ndoubtful\u201d that the purported right existed, because it is\n\u201carguably inconsistent with the common practice of allow-\ning penalty-only trials on remand of cases where a death\nsentence\u2014but not the underlying conviction\u2014is struck\ndown on appeal.\u201d Id., at 173, n. 6. Two other Members of\nthe Court would have rejected the claim outright. Id., at\n187 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment).\n   After Franklin, the lower courts have unanimously\ndenied constitutional claims like the one we consider\ntoday. See, e.g., Ziegler v. Crosby, 345 F. 3d 1300, 1310\n(CA11 2003); Evans v. Thompson, 881 F. 2d 117, 121 (CA4\n1989); Duest v. State, 855 So. 2d 33, 40\u201341 (Fla. 2003);\nCommonwealth v. Fisher, 572 Pa. 105, 115\u2013116, 813 A. 2d\n                 Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)           3\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n761, 767 (2002); People v. Emerson, 189 Ill. 2d 436, 501\u2013\n504, 727 N. E. 2d 302, 338\u2013339 (2000); State v. Fletcher,\n354 N. C. 455, 470\u2013472, 555 S. E. 2d 534, 544 (2001);\nMelson v. State, 775 So. 2d 857, 898\u2013899 (Ala. Crim. App.\n1999). The last apparent scrap of authority for the con-\ntrary view came from our cryptic opinion in Green v. Geor-\ngia, 442 U. S. 95 (1979) (per curiam), on which the Oregon\nSupreme Court principally relied. See App. to Pet. for\nCert. 58\u201362. The chief virtue of today\u2019s opinion lies in its\ndiscarding the notion that Green provides any support for\nan Eighth Amendment right to argue residual doubt at\nsentencing. See ante, at 6\u20137.\n  In mentioning, however, the superfluous circumstance\nthat Oregon law happens to provide for the admission at\nsentencing of some evidence that relates to innocence, the\nCourt risks creating doubt where none should exist. Capi-\ntal defendants might now be tempted to argue that the\namount of residual-doubt evidence carried over from\nthe guilt phase in their sentencing hearings is insufficient\nto satisfy the Court\u2019s third factor. Every one of these\n\u201cresidual-doubt\u201d claims will be meritless in light of the\nCourt\u2019s first two factors. We should make this perfectly\nclear today.\n",

With him on the brief was <i>J. Kevin Hunt.</i><sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Respondent Randy Lee Guzek was found guilty of capital murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but vacated the sentence and ordered a new sentencing proceeding. The question before the Court is whether the State may limit the innocence-related evidence he can introduce at that proceeding to the evidence he introduced at his original trial. We hold that the limitation does not violate the Constitution.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Oregon tried Guzek for the offense of capital murder. The evidence showed that Guzek and two associates decided to burglarize the Houser family home, that they entered the house, that an associate killed Rod Houser, and that Guzek then robbed and killed Lois Houser. After the police <span class=\"star-pagination\">*520</span> learned that Guzek held a special grudge against the Housers, they traced him and his associates. The associates confessed. And they testified at trial, painting Guzek as the ringleader.</p>\n<p>Guzek's defense rested in part upon an alibi. He presented two alibi witnesses, his grandfather and his mother, who testified that Guzek had been with the one or the other at the time of the crime. The jury disbelieved the alibi, it convicted Guzek, and it sentenced him to death.</p>\n<p>Guzek appealed; the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed the conviction; but the court ordered a new sentencing proceeding. Guzek was again sentenced to death; he again appealed; and the Oregon Supreme Court again ordered resentencing. Guzek was sentenced to death for the third time; he again appealed; and yet again the Oregon Supreme Court found the sentencing procedures faulty. 336 Ore. 424, 86 P. 3d 1106 (2004). Seeking to avoid further errors at the next (the fourth) sentencing proceeding, the Oregon Supreme Court also addressed the admissibility of certain evidence Guzek seeks to introduce at that proceeding, including live testimony from his mother about his alibi.</p>\n<p>The Oregon Supreme Court held that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments provide Guzek a federal constitutional right to introduce this evidence at his upcoming sentencing proceeding. At Oregon's request, we agreed to review that determination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Before turning to the merits of Oregon's claim, we consider a motion that Guzek made, asking us to dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted. The motion rests upon Guzek's claim that, irrespective of federal law, <i>state</i> law gives him the right to introduce his mother's live testimony\u0097the additional alibi evidence here at issue. See Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 138.012(2)(b) (2003). For this reason, he says, the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear this appeal, or, at the least, there is no good practical reason for us to decide the federal issue.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*521</span> We cannot agree, however, that we lack jurisdiction to hear the case. We possess jurisdiction to review state-court determinations that rest upon federal law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257(a). And the Oregon Supreme Court here based its legal conclusion in relevant part on federal law. The court pointed out that <i>state</i> law permits the introduction (at a new sentencing hearing) of \"`evidence . . . <i>relevant</i> to [the] sentence including . . . mitigating evidence <i>relevant</i> to . . . [w]hether the defendant should receive a death sentence.'\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 45 (quoting Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 163.150(1)(a), (b) (2003); emphasis added and deleted). But it immediately added that the state law's words \"relevant . . . mitigating evidence\" refer (in the present context) only to evidence that the <i>Federal Constitution</i> grants a defendant the right to present. App. to Pet. for Cert. 45-52.</p>\n<p>The Oregon court went on to discuss this Court's statements to the effect that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments \"`require that the sentencer . . . not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor . . . any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 54 (quoting <i>Lockett</i> v. <i>Ohio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109935\"><a href=\"/opinion/109935/lockett-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, 604 (1978) (plurality opinion); emphasis deleted); cf. App. to Pet. for Cert. 56 (recognizing that this aspect of <i>Lockett</i> was adopted by a majority of the Court in <i>Eddings</i> v. <i>Oklahoma,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110641\"><a href=\"/opinion/110641/eddings-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 110 (1982)). And the Oregon court then interpreted this Court's holding in <i>Green</i> v. <i>Georgia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110089\"><a href=\"/opinion/110089/green-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span> (1979) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> as including, within that federal admissibility requirement, evidence which, like the proffered alibi testimony, tends to show that the defendant did not commit the crime for which he has been convicted. Thus, it held that state law demanded \"admissibility\" solely for a federal reason. And we possess jurisdiction. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>South Dakota</i> v. <i>Neville,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110832\"><a href=\"/opinion/110832/south-dakota-v-neville/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">553</span></a></span>, 556, n. 5 (1983); <i>Delaware</i> v. <i>Prouse,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110045\"><a href=\"/opinion/110045/delaware-v-prouse/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">648</span></a></span>, 651-653 (1979).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*522</span> Neither are we persuaded by Guzek's argument that we should dismiss the case because irrespective of federal law and irrespective of the Oregon Supreme Court's federal holding, Oregon law gives him the right to introduce witnesses who testified at the guilt phase; and his mother was such a witness (a fact, he says, that the Oregon Supreme Court overlooked). Guzek points in support to an Oregon capital-case resentencing statute that says,</p>\n<blockquote>\"[a] transcript of all testimony and all exhibits and other evidence properly admitted in the prior trial . . . are admissible in the new sentencing proceeding.\" Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 138.012(2)(b) (2003).</blockquote>\n<p>The provision adds that,</p>\n<blockquote>\"[e]ither party may recall any witness who testified at the prior trial . . . and may present additional relevant evidence.\" <i>Ibid.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We do not doubt that these provisions give Guzek the state-law right to introduce a <i>transcript</i> of guilt-phase testimony. App. to Pet. for Cert. 43 (authorizing introduction of transcript of Guzek's grandfather's alibi testimony). But Guzek wishes to do more than introduce a <i>transcript</i> of his mother's alibi evidence; he wishes to call his mother to the stand as a live witness and elicit <i>additional</i> alibi testimony. Tr. of Oral Arg. 37-39, 41, 55-56. The Oregon statute quoted above does not expressly say whether he may do so. It does give him the right to \"recall any witness\" who testified at the first trial and to \"present additional <i>relevant</i> evidence.\" (Emphasis added.) But is this additional evidence \"relevant\"? The Oregon Supreme Court thought so, but only because <i>federal</i> law insists upon its relevance. And its opinion suggests that, in the absence of federal compulsion, it would not fall within the scope of the state statutory word \"relevant.\" See <i>supra,</i> at 521.</p>\n<p>At most, Guzek has shown that state law <i>might,</i> not that it <i>does,</i> independently give him the right to introduce this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*523</span> evidence. We have made clear that \"a <i>possible</i> adequate and independent state ground\" for a decision does not \"bar [our] reaching the federal questions\" where, as here, a \"State Supreme Court quite clearly rested its [decision] solely on the Federal Constitution.\" <i>California</i> v. <i>Ramos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111019\"><a href=\"/opinion/111019/california-v-ramos/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span>, 997, n. 7 (1983); see also <i>City of Revere</i> v. <i>Massachusetts Gen. Hospital,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110998\"><a href=\"/opinion/110998/city-of-revere-v-massachusetts-gen-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></a></span>, 242 (1983); <i>United Air Lines, Inc.</i> v. <i>Mahin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108737\"><a href=\"/opinion/108737/united-air-lines-inc-v-mahin/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">623</span></a></span>, 630-631 (1973). And we consequently deny the motion to dismiss the writ.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>As our discussion in Part II, <i>supra,</i> makes clear, the federal question before us is a narrow one. Do the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments grant Guzek a constitutional right to present evidence of the kind he seeks to introduce, namely, <i>new</i> evidence that shows he was not present at the scene of the crime. That evidence is <i>inconsistent</i> with Guzek's prior conviction. It sheds no light on <i>the manner</i> in which he committed the crime for which he has been convicted. Nor is it evidence that Guzek contends was unavailable to him at the time of the original trial. And, to the extent it is evidence he introduced at that time, he is free to introduce it now, albeit in transcript form. Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 138.012(2)(b) (2003). We can find nothing in the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments that provides a capital defendant a right to introduce new evidence of this kind at sentencing.</p>\n<p>We cannot agree with the Oregon Supreme Court that our previous cases have found in the Eighth Amendment a constitutional right broad enough to encompass the evidence here at issue. In <i>Lockett</i> v. <i>Ohio, supra</i><i>,</i> a plurality of this Court decided that a defendant convicted of acting in concert with others to rob and to kill could introduce at the sentencing stage evidence that she had played a minor role in the crime, indeed, that she had remained outside the shop (where the killing took place) at the time of the crime. A plurality of the Court wrote that,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*524</span> \"the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the sentencer . . . not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's character or record and <i>any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers</i> as a basis for a sentence less than death.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 604 (emphasis added and deleted).</blockquote>\n<p>And in <i>Eddings</i> v. <i>Oklahoma,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110641\"><a href=\"/opinion/110641/eddings-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, the Court majority adopted this statement. See also <i>McCleskey</i> v. <i>Kemp,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111869\"><a href=\"/opinion/111869/mccleskey-v-kemp/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span>, 306 (1987); <i>Bell</i> v. <i>Ohio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109936\"><a href=\"/opinion/109936/bell-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></a></span>, 642 (1978) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p>But the evidence at issue in these cases was traditional sentence-related evidence, evidence that tended to show <i>how,</i> not <i>whether,</i> the defendant committed the crime. Nor was the evidence directly inconsistent with the jury's finding of guilt.</p>\n<p>The Oregon Supreme Court thought that this latter distinction\u0097the fact that the \"alibi evidence was inconsistent with,\" rather than \"consistent with[,] the underlying convictions\"\u0097did not matter. App. to Pet. for Cert. 58. It said that this \"factual distinction . . . is of no consequence in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Green</i> v. <i>Georgia</i><i>.\" Ibid.</i> In <i>Green,</i> however, the Court focused upon a defendant convicted of murder, who sought to introduce at sentencing a statement his confederate made to a third party that he (the confederate) had alone committed the murder (<i>i. e.,</i> without the defendant). The State opposed its use at the defendant's sentencing hearing <i>on the ground that, as to the defendant, it was hearsay.</i> The Court, in a brief <i>per curiam</i> opinion, noted that the State had used the confession in the confederate's trial, referred to an earlier case holding that the Constitution prohibits States from \"`mechanistically'\" applying the hearsay rule \"`to defeat the ends of justice,'\" and held that the Constitution prohibited the State from barring use of the confession. 442 U.S., at 97 (quoting <i>Chambers</i> v. <i>Mississippi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108718\"><a href=\"/opinion/108718/chambers-v-mississippi/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span>, 302 (1973)). The opinion focused only upon the hearsay problem, and it implicitly assumed that, in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*525</span> the absence of the hearsay problem, <i>state</i> law would not have blocked admission of the evidence.</p>\n<p>In any event, subsequent to <i>Green,</i> this Court decided <i>Franklin</i> v. <i>Lynaugh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112122\"><a href=\"/opinion/112122/franklin-v-lynaugh/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span> (1988), and that case makes clear, contrary to the Oregon Supreme Court's understanding, that this Court's previous cases had <i>not</i> interpreted the Eighth Amendment as providing a capital defendant the right to introduce at sentencing evidence designed to cast \"residual doubt\" on his guilt of the basic crime of conviction. The <i>Franklin</i> plurality said it was \"quite doubtful\" that any such right existed. <i>Id.,</i> at 173, n. 6. And two other Members of the Court added that \"[o]ur cases\" do not support any such \"right to reconsideration by the sentencing body of lingering doubts about . . . guilt.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 187 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). See also <i>Penry</i> v. <i>Lynaugh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112325\"><a href=\"/opinion/112325/penry-v-lynaugh/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 320 (1989) (characterizing <i>Franklin</i> as a case in which a majority \"agreed that `residual doubt' as to Franklin's guilt was not a constitutionally mandated mitigating factor\" (brackets omitted)).</p>\n<p><i>Franklin</i> did not resolve whether the Eighth Amendment affords capital defendants such a right, for the plurality held that the sentencing scheme at issue was constitutional \"even if such a right existed.\" 487 U.S., at 174. But the Court's statements on the matter make clear that the Oregon Supreme Court erred in interpreting <i>Green</i> as providing a capital defendant with a constitutional right to introduce residual doubt evidence at sentencing.</p>\n<p>In this case, we once again face a situation where we need not resolve whether such a right exists, for, even if it does, it could not extend so far as to provide this defendant with a right to introduce the evidence at issue. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Alabama State Federation of Labor</i> v. <i>McAdory,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104156\"><a href=\"/opinion/104156/alabama-state-federation-of-labor-v-mcadory/\"><span class=\"volume\">325</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span>, 461-462 (1945). The Eighth Amendment insists upon \"`reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case.'\" <i>Penry, supra,</i> at 328 (quoting <i>Woodson</i> v. <i>North Carolina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109535\"><a href=\"/opinion/109535/woodson-v-north-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span>, 305 (1976) (plurality <span class=\"star-pagination\">*526</span> opinion)). The Eighth Amendment also insists that a sentencing jury be able \"to consider and give effect to mitigating evidence\" about the defendant's \"character or record or the circumstances of the offense.\" <i>Penry, supra,</i> at 327-328. But the Eighth Amendment does not deprive the State of its authority to set reasonable limits upon the evidence a defendant can submit, and to control the manner in which it is submitted. Rather, \"States are free to structure and shape consideration of mitigating evidence `in an effort to achieve a more rational and equitable administration of the death penalty.'\" <i>Boyde</i> v. <i>California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112386\"><a href=\"/opinion/112386/boyde-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span>, 377 (1990) (quoting <i>Franklin, supra,</i> at 181 (plurality opinion)); see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Johnson</i> v. <i>Texas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112897\"><a href=\"/opinion/112897/johnson-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span>, 362 (1993); <i>California</i> v. <i>Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111797\"><a href=\"/opinion/111797/california-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span>, 543 (1987).</p>\n<p>Three circumstances, taken together, convince us that the State possesses the authority to regulate, through exclusion, the evidence that Guzek seeks to present. First, sentencing traditionally concerns <i>how,</i> not <i>whether,</i> a defendant committed the crime. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1A1.1, editorial note, \u00a7 4(a), p. 4 (Nov. 2004). But the evidence at issue here\u0097alibi evidence\u0097concerns only <i>whether,</i> not <i>how,</i> he did so.</p>\n<p>Second, the parties previously litigated the issue to which the evidence is relevant\u0097whether the defendant committed the basic crime. The evidence thereby attacks a previously determined matter in a proceeding at which, in principle, that matter is not at issue. The law typically discourages collateral attacks of this kind. Cf. <i>Allen</i> v. <i>McCurry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110360\"><a href=\"/opinion/110360/allen-v-mccurry/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 94 (1980) (\"As this Court and other courts have often recognized, res judicata and collateral estoppel relieve parties of the cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources, and, by preventing inconsistent decisions, encourage reliance on adjudication\").</p>\n<p>Third, the negative impact of a rule restricting defendant's ability to introduce <i>new</i> alibi evidence is minimized by the fact that Oregon law gives the defendant the right to present <span class=\"star-pagination\">*527</span> to the sentencing jury <i>all</i> the evidence of innocence from the original trial regardless. That law permits the defendant to introduce at resentencing transcripts and exhibits from his prior trial. Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 138.012(2)(b) (2003). The defendant here has not claimed that the evidence at issue was unavailable at the time of his original trial. Thus, he need only have introduced it at that time to guarantee its presentation (albeit through transcripts) to a resentencing jury as well.</p>\n<p>The legitimacy of these trial management and evidentiary considerations, along with the typically minimal adverse impact that a restriction would have on a defendant's ability to present his alibi claim at resentencing convinces us that the Eighth Amendment does not protect defendant's right to present the evidence at issue here. We conclude that the Oregon court was wrong in holding to the contrary.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Guzek also contends that, even if the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments do not mandate the admission of his mother's testimony, he is entitled to introduce that evidence to impeach his associates, whose earlier testimony the government intends to introduce at resentencing. The Oregon Supreme Court did not address this issue; nor do we believe it fairly encompassed within the question presented. The Oregon courts are free to consider it on remand should they believe it appropriate to do so.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, we vacate the judgment of the Oregon Supreme Court, and we remand the case for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*528</span> JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>In this case, we have the opportunity to put to rest, once and for all, the mistaken notion that the Eighth Amendment requires that a convicted capital defendant be given the opportunity, at his sentencing hearing, to present evidence and argument concerning residual doubts about his guilt. Although the Court correctly holds that there is no Eighth Amendment violation in this case, I would follow the Court's logic to its natural conclusion and reject all Eighth Amendment residual-doubt claims.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that we have jurisdiction and should exercise it in this case. What requires me to withhold agreement to the Court's opinion is the last of the \"[t]hree circumstances\" on which it relies, <i>ante,</i> at 526\u0097 namely, \"the fact that Oregon law gives the defendant the right to present to the sentencing jury <i>all</i> the evidence of innocence from the original trial.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 526-527 (emphasis in original). The first two of the circumstances are alone sufficient to dispose of the claim that the Eighth Amendment guarantees a capital defendant a <i>second</i> opportunity, at sentencing, to litigate his innocence. In fact, the Court's third \"circumstance\" is an analytical misfit in the company of the other two. The first two\u0097that \"sentencing traditionally concerns <i>how,</i> not <i>whether,</i> a defendant committed the crime,\" <i>ante,</i> at 526, and that \"the parties previously litigated the issue to which the evidence is relevant,\" <i>ibid.</i>\u0097show that compelling the admission of innocence-related evidence would be <i>improper</i> and <i>unnecessary</i> at a sentencing hearing. The third, by contrast, suggests that there is no constitutional violation in this case because <i>enough</i> of such evidence may be admitted on remand. The latter factor would be relevant only if the former two were not.</p>\n<p>If we needed any third factor to justify our holding, a better candidate would be that the claim we consider here finds <span class=\"star-pagination\">*529</span> no support in our Nation's legal history and traditions. In 1986, Justice Marshall correctly observed that there had been \"few times in which any legitimacy has been given to the power of a convicted capital defendant facing the possibility of a death sentence to argue as a mitigating factor the chance that he might be innocent.\" <i>Lockhart</i> v. <i>McCree,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111665\"><a href=\"/opinion/111665/lockhart-v-mccree/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span>, 205 (dissenting opinion). Nothing has changed on that score in the last 20 years. On the contrary, in <i>Franklin</i> v. <i>Lynaugh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112122\"><a href=\"/opinion/112122/franklin-v-lynaugh/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span> (1988), four Members of this Court noted that our \"prior decisions . . . fail to recognize a constitutional right to have such doubts considered as a mitigating factor,\" <i>id.,</i> at 174 (plurality opinion). They were, moreover, \"quite doubtful\" that the purported right existed, because it is \"arguably inconsistent with the common practice of allowing penalty-only trials on remand of cases where a death sentence\u0097but not the underlying conviction\u0097is struck down on appeal.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 173, n. 6. Two other Members of the Court would have rejected the claim outright. <i>Id.,</i> at 187 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>After <i>Franklin,</i> the lower courts have unanimously denied constitutional claims like the one we consider today. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Zeigler</i> v. <i>Crosby,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76313\"><a href=\"/opinion/76313/zeigler-v-crosby/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1300</span></a></span>, 1310 (CA11 2003); <i>Evans</i> v. <i>Thompson,</i> 881 F. 2d 117, 121 (CA4 1989); <i>Duest</i> v. <i>State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1909892\"><a href=\"/opinion/1909892/duest-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 40-41 (Fla. 2003); <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Fisher,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></span>, 115-116, 813 A. 2d 761, 767 (2002); <i>People</i> v. <i>Emerson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2098683\"><a href=\"/opinion/2098683/people-v-emerson/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 501-504, 727 N. E. 2d 302, 338-339 (2000); <i>State</i> v. <i>Fletcher,</i> 354 N. C. 455, 470-472, 555 S. E. 2d 534, 544 (2001); <i>Melson</i> v. <i>State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1648105\"><a href=\"/opinion/1648105/melson-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">775</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">857</span></a></span>, 898-899 (Ala. Crim. App. 1999). The last apparent scrap of authority for the contrary view came from our cryptic opinion in <i>Green</i> v. <i>Georgia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110089\"><a href=\"/opinion/110089/green-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span> (1979) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> on which the Oregon Supreme Court principally relied. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 58-62. The chief virtue of today's opinion lies in its discarding the notion that <i>Green</i> provides any support for an Eighth Amendment right to argue residual doubt at sentencing. See <i>ante,</i> at 524-525.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*530</span> In mentioning, however, the superfluous circumstance that Oregon law happens to provide for the admission at sentencing of <i>some</i> evidence that relates to innocence, the Court risks creating doubt where none should exist. Capital defendants might now be tempted to argue that the <i>amount</i> of residual-doubt evidence carried over from the guilt phase in their sentencing hearings is insufficient to satisfy the Court's third factor. Every one of these \"residual-doubt\" claims will be meritless in light of the Court's first two factors. We should make this perfectly clear today.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  A brief of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal was filed for the State of Alabama et al. by <i>Troy King,</i> Attorney General of Alabama, and <i>Kevin C.
