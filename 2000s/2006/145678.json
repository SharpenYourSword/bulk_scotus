This case involves one such delivery point\u0e42\u0080\u0094petitioner Barbara Dolan's porch\u0e42\u0080\u0094where mail left by postal employees allegedly caused her to trip and fall. Claiming injuries as a result, Dolan filed a claim for administrative relief from the Postal Service. When her claim was denied, she and her husband (whose claim for loss of consortium the Dolans later conceded was barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies) filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, asserting that the Postal Service's negligent placement of mail at their home subjected the Government to liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u0e07\u0e07 1346(b)(1), 2674. The District Court dismissed Dolan's suit, and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, 377 F.3d 285 (2004). Both courts concluded that, although the FTCA generally waives sovereign immunity as to federal employees' torts, Dolan's claims were barred by an exception to that waiver, 28 U.S.C. \u0e07 2680(b). We disagree and hold that Dolan's suit may proceed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Under the Postal Reorganization Act, 39 U.S.C. \u0e07 101 <i>et seq.,</i> the Postal Service is \"an independent establishment of the executive branch of the Government of the United <span class=\"star-pagination\">*484</span> States,\" \u0e07 201. Holding a monopoly over carriage of letters, the Postal Service has \"significant governmental powers,\" including the power of eminent domain, the authority to make searches and seizures in the enforcement of laws protecting the mails, the authority to promulgate postal regulations, and, subject to the Secretary of State's supervision, the power to enter international postal agreements. See <i>Postal Service</i> v. <i>Flamingo Industries (USA) Ltd.,</i> 540 U.S. 736, 741 (2004) (discussing 39 U.S.C. \u0e07\u0e07 101, 401, 407, 601-606). Consistent with this status, the Postal Service enjoys federal sovereign immunity absent a waiver. See <i>ibid.;</i> cf. <i>FDIC</i> v. <i>Meyer,</i> 510 U.S. 471, 475 (1994) (\"Absent a waiver, sovereign immunity shields the Federal Government and its agencies from suit\").</p>\n<p>Although the Postal Reorganization Act generally \"waives the immunity of the Postal Service from suit by giving it the power `to sue and be sued in its official name,'\" <i>Flamingo Industries, supra,</i> at 741 (quoting 39 U.S.C. \u0e07 401(1)), the statute also provides that the FTCA \"shall apply to tort claims arising out of activities of the Postal Service,\" \u0e07 409(c).</p>\n<p>The FTCA, in turn, waives sovereign immunity in two different sections of the United States Code. The first confers federal-court jurisdiction in a defined category of cases involving negligence committed by federal employees in the course of their employment. This jurisdictional grant covers:</p>\n<blockquote>\"claims against the United States, for money damages, accruing on and after January 1, 1945, for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\" 28 U.S.C. \u0e07 1346(b)(1).</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*485</span> As to claims falling within this jurisdictional grant, the FTCA, in a second provision, makes the United States liable \"in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,\" though not \"for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages.\" \u0e07 2674; see generally <i>United States</i> v. <i>Olson, ante,</i> at 44.</p>\n<p>The FTCA qualifies its waiver of sovereign immunity for certain categories of claims (13 in all). If one of the exceptions applies, the bar of sovereign immunity remains. The 13 categories of exempted claims are set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u0e07 2680, and the relevant subsection for our purposes, pertaining to postal operations, is \u0e07 2680(b). It states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall not apply to . . . [a]ny claim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter.\"</blockquote>\n<p>As a consequence, the United States may be liable if postal employees commit torts under local law, but not for claims defined by this exception.</p>\n<p>This was the provision relied upon by the District Court and Court of Appeals to dismiss Dolan's suit. The Court of Appeals' decision created a conflict with a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. See <i>Raila</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 355 F.3d 118, 121 (2004). We granted certiorari. 544 U.S. 998 (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We assume that under the applicable state law a person injured by tripping over a package or bundle of papers negligently left on the porch of a residence by a private party would have a cause of action for damages. See 28 U.S.C. \u0e07\u0e07 1346(b)(1), 2674. The question is whether, when mail left by the Postal Service causes the slip and fall, the \u0e07 2680(b) exception for \"loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter\" preserves sovereign immunity despite the FTCA's more general statements of waiver.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*486</span> If considered in isolation, the phrase \"negligent transmission\" could embrace a wide range of negligent acts committed by the Postal Service in the course of delivering mail, including creation of slip-and-fall hazards from leaving packets and parcels on the porch of a residence. After all, in ordinary meaning and usage, transmission of the mail is not complete until it arrives at the destination. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2429 (1971) (defining \"transmission\" as \"an act, process, or instance of transmitting\" and \"transmit\" as \"to cause to go or be conveyed to another person or place\"). In large part this inference\u0e42\u0080\u0094 transmission includes delivery\u0e42\u0080\u0094led the District Court and Court of Appeals to rule for the Government. See 377 F.3d, at 288; App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a-6a. The definition of words in isolation, however, is not necessarily controlling in statutory construction. A word in a statute may or may not extend to the outer limits of its definitional possibilities. Interpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text, considering the purpose and context of the statute, and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis. Here, we conclude both context and precedent require a narrower reading, so that \"negligent transmission\" does not go beyond negligence causing mail to be lost or to arrive late, in damaged condition, or at the wrong address. See <i>Raila, supra,</i> at 121 (holding the postal exception covers \"damages and delay of the postal material itself and consequential damages therefrom\"). The phrase does not comprehend all negligence occurring in the course of mail delivery.</p>\n<p>Starting with context, the words \"negligent transmission\" in \u0e07 2680(b) follow two other terms, \"loss\" and \"miscarriage.\" Those terms, we think, limit the reach of \"transmission.\" \"[A] word is known by the company it keeps\"\u0e42\u0080\u0094a rule that \"is often wisely applied where a word is capable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.\" <i>Jarecki</i> v. <i>G. D. Searle &amp; Co.,</i> 367 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*487</span> U.S. 303, 307 (1961); see also <i>Dole</i> v. <i>Steelworkers,</i> 494 U.S. 26, 36 (1990) (\"[W]ords grouped in a list should be given related meaning\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Here, as both parties acknowledge, mail is \"lost\" if it is destroyed or misplaced and \"miscarried\" if it goes to the wrong address. Since both those terms refer to failings in the postal obligation to deliver mail in a timely manner to the right address, it would be odd if \"negligent transmission\" swept far more broadly to include injuries like those alleged here\u0e42\u0080\u0094 injuries that happen to be caused by postal employees but involve neither failure to transmit mail nor damage to its contents.</p>\n<p>Our interpretation would be less secure were it not for a precedent we deem to have decisive weight here. We refer to <i>Kosak</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 465 U.S. 848 (1984). In <i>Kosak,</i> an art collector alleged in an FTCA suit that artworks he owned were damaged when the United States Customs Service seized and detained them. <i>Id.,</i> at 849-850. The question was whether the Government retained immunity based on \u0e07 2680(c), a provision that has since been amended but at the time covered:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[a]ny claim arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any goods or merchandise by any officer of customs or excise or any other law-enforcement officer.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 852, n. 6 (internal quotation marks omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>In its opinion concluding the exception did apply and thus that the United States retained sovereign immunity, the Court gave specific consideration to the postal exception. In a part of the opinion central to its holding, the Court contrasted what it called the \"generality of \u0e07 2680(c)\" with the \"specificity of \u0e07 2680(b),\" <i>id.,</i> at 855. The Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote>\"One of the principal purposes of the Federal Tort Claims Act was to waive the Government's immunity from liability for injuries resulting from auto accidents <span class=\"star-pagination\">*488</span> in which employees of the Postal System were at fault. In order to ensure that \u0e07 2680(b), which governs torts committed by mailmen, did not have the effect of barring precisely the sort of suit that Congress was most concerned to authorize, the draftsmen of the provision carefully delineated the types of misconduct for which the Government was not assuming financial responsibility\u0e42\u0080\u0094namely, `the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter'\u0e42\u0080\u0094thereby excluding, by implication, negligent handling of motor vehicles.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>In the present case neither party suggests <i>Kosak</i>'s conclusion regarding negligent operation of postal motor vehicles should be ignored as dictum. In light of <i>Kosak</i>'s discussion, we cannot interpret the phrase \"negligent transmission\" in \u0e07 2680(b) to cover all negligence in the course of mail delivery. Although postal trucks may well be delivering\u0e42\u0080\u0094and thus transmitting\u0e42\u0080\u0094mail when they collide with other vehicles, <i>Kosak</i> indicates the United States, nonetheless, retains no immunity.</p>\n<p>Seeking to distinguish postal auto accidents from Dolan's fall, the Government argues that negligent driving relates only circumstantially to the mail, whereas Dolan's accident was caused by the mail itself. Nothing in the statutory text supports this distinction. Quite the contrary, if placing mail so as to create a slip-and-fall risk constitutes \"negligent transmission,\" the same should be true of driving postal trucks in a manner that endangers others on the road. In both cases the postal employee acts negligently while transmitting mail. In addition, as the Second Circuit recognized and as the Government acknowledged at oral argument, focusing on whether the mail itself caused the injury would yield anomalies, perhaps making liability turn on whether a mail sack causing a slip-and-fall was empty or full, or whether a pedestrian sideswiped by a passing truck was hit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*489</span> by the side-view mirror or a dangling parcel. See <i>Raila,</i> 355 F.3d, at 122-123.</p>\n<p>We think it more likely that Congress intended to retain immunity, as a general rule, only for injuries arising, directly or consequentially, because mail either fails to arrive at all or arrives late, in damaged condition, or at the wrong address. Illustrative instances of the exception's operation, then, would be personal or financial harms arising from nondelivery or late delivery of sensitive materials or information (<i>e. g.,</i> medicines or a mortgage foreclosure notice) or from negligent handling of a mailed parcel (<i>e. g.,</i> shattering of shipped china). Such harms, after all, are the sort primarily identified with the Postal Service's function of transporting mail throughout the United States.</p>\n<p>Resisting this conclusion, the Government emphasizes the Postal Service's vast operations\u0e42\u0080\u0094the 660 million daily mailings and 142 million delivery points mentioned at the outset. See Brief for Respondents 36. As delivery to mailboxes and doorsteps is essential to this nationwide undertaking, Congress must have intended, the Government asserts, to insulate delivery-related torts from liability. If, however, doorstep delivery is essential to the postal enterprise, then driving postal trucks is no less so. And in any event, while it is true \"[t]he \u0e07 2680 exceptions are designed to protect certain important governmental functions and prerogatives from disruption,\" <i>Molzof</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 502 U.S. 301, 311 (1992), the specificity of \u0e07 2680(b), see <i>Kosak, supra,</i> at 855, indicates that Congress did not intend to immunize all postal activities.</p>\n<p>Other FTCA exceptions paint with a far broader brush. They cover, for example: \"[a]ny claim for damages caused by the fiscal operations of the Treasury or by the regulation of the monetary system,\" 28 U.S.C. \u0e07 2680(i); \"[a]ny claim arising out of the combatant activities of the military or naval forces, or the Coast Guard, during time of war,\" \u0e07 2680(j); \"[a]ny claim arising in a foreign country,\" \u0e07 2680(k); \"[a]ny <span class=\"star-pagination\">*490</span> claim arising from the activities of the Tennessee Valley Authority,\" \u0e07 2680(<i>l</i>), or \"the Panama Canal Company,\" \u0e07 2680(m); and \"[a]ny claim arising from the activities of a Federal land bank, a Federal intermediate credit bank, or a bank for cooperatives,\" \u0e07 2680(n). Had Congress intended to preserve immunity for all torts related to postal delivery\u0e42\u0080\u0094 torts including hazardous mail placement at customer homes\u0e42\u0080\u0094it could have used similarly sweeping language in \u0e07 2680(b). By instead \"carefully delineat[ing]\" just three types of harm (loss, miscarriage, and negligent transmission), see <i>Kosak,</i> 465 U.S., at 855, Congress expressed the intent to immunize only a subset of postal wrongdoing, not all torts committed in the course of mail delivery.</p>\n<p>Further supporting our interpretation, losses of the type for which immunity is retained under \u0e07 2680(b) are at least to some degree avoidable or compensable through postal registration and insurance. See United States Postal Service, Mailing Standards, Domestic Mail Manual 609.1.1 (Nov. 10, 2005), available at http://pe.usps.gov/text/dmm300/ 609.htm (as visited Jan. 9, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court's case file) (allowing indemnity claims for loss or damage of \"insured, collect on delivery (COD), registered with postal insurance, or Express Mail\"); 39 CFR \u0e07 111.1 (2005) (incorporating by reference the Domestic Mail Manual). The same was true when Congress enacted the FTCA in 1946. See 39 U.S.C. \u0e07 245 (1940 ed. and Supp. V) (setting rates and conditions for mail insurance); \u0e07 381 (1946 ed.) (\"For the greater security of valuable mail matter the Postmaster General may establish a uniform system of registration, and as a part of such system he may provide rules under which the senders or owners of any registered matter shall be indemnified for loss, rifling, or damage thereof in the mails . . .\"). As <i>Kosak</i> explains, one purpose of the FTCA exceptions was to avoid \"extending the coverage of the Act to suits for which adequate remedies were already available,\" 465 U.S., at 858\u0e42\u0080\u0094an objective consistent with retaining <span class=\"star-pagination\">*491</span> immunity as to claims of mail damage or delay covered by postal registration and insurance. While the Government suggests other injuries falling outside the FTCA are also subject to administrative relief, even assuming that is true, the provision the Government cites permits only discretionary relief, not an automatic remedy like postal insurance. See 39 U.S.C. \u0e07 2603 (indicating the Postal Service \"may adjust and settle\" personal-injury and property-damage claims \"not cognizable\" under the FTCA's administrative relief provision); see also 31 U.S.C. \u0e07 224c (1940 ed.) (indicating that \"[w]hen any damage is done to person or property by or through the operation of the Post Office Department. . . the Postmaster General is invested with power to adjust and settle any claim for such damage when his award for such damage in any case does not exceed $500\"); Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, \u0e07 424(a), 60 Stat. 846-847 (repealing \u0e07 224c as to negligence claims cognizable under the FTCA).</p>\n<p>The Government raises the specter of frivolous slip-andfall claims inundating the Postal Service. It is true that, in addition to other considerations we have identified, <i>Kosak</i> describes \"avoiding exposure of the United States to liability for excessive or fraudulent claims\" as a principal aim of the FTCA exceptions, 465 U.S., at 858. Slip-and-fall liability, however, to the extent state tort law imposes it, is a risk shared by any business that makes home deliveries. Given that \"negligent transmission,\" viewed in context and in light of <i>Kosak,</i> cannot sweep as broadly as the Government claims, ordinary protections against frivolous litigation must suffice here, just as they do in the case of motor vehicle collisions.</p>\n<p>Finally, it should be noted that this case does not implicate the general rule that \"a waiver of the Government's sovereign immunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign,\" <i>Lane</i> v. <i>Pen\u0e51a,</i> 518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996). As <i>Kosak</i> explains, this principle is \"unhelpful\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*492</span> in the FTCA context, where \"unduly generous interpretations of the exceptions run the risk of defeating the central purpose of the statute,\" 465 U.S., at 853, n. 9, which \"waives the Government's immunity from suit in sweeping language,\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Yellow Cab Co.,</i> 340 U.S. 543, 547 (1951); see also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Nordic Village, Inc.,</i> 503 U.S. 30, 34 (1992) (observing \"[w]e have on occasion narrowly construed exceptions to waivers of sovereign immunity where that was consistent with Congress' clear intent, as in the context of the `sweeping language' of the [FTCA]\" (quoting <i>Yellow Cab Co., supra,</i> at 547)). Hence, \"the proper objective of a court attempting to construe one of the subsections of 28 U.S.C. \u0e07 2680 is to identify `those circumstances which are within the words and reason of the exception'\u0e42\u0080\u0094no less and no more.\" <i>Kosak, supra,</i> at 853, n. 9 (quoting <i>Dalehite</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 346 U.S. 15, 31 (1953)). Having made that inquiry here, we conclude Dolan's claims fall outside \u0e07 2680(b).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The postal exception is inapplicable, and Dolan's claim falls within the FTCA's general waiver of federal sovereign immunity. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) waives the Government's sovereign immunity for civil suits seeking money damages</p>\n<blockquote>\"for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*493</span> within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred,\" 28 U.S.C. \u0e07 1346(b)(1),</blockquote>\n<p>save several exceptions found in \u0e07 2680. As relevant here, Congress reserved to the Government its sovereign immunity respecting \"[a]ny claim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter.\" \u0e07 2680(b) (postal exception).</p>\n<p>Petitioner Barbara Dolan claims to have suffered personal injuries when she tripped over letters, packages, and periodicals that an employee of the United States Postal Service (Postal Service) negligently left on her porch. Today, the Court concludes that Dolan's lawsuit may proceed because her claim does not fall within the exception. I disagree. Dolan's claim arises out of the Postal Service's \"negligent transmission\" of mail and is thus covered by the terms of the postal exception. Even if the exception is ambiguous, this Court's cases require that ambiguities as to the scope of the Government's waiver of immunity be resolved in its favor. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The text of the postal exception, and every term therein, should be ascribed its ordinary meaning. See <i>FDIC</i> v. <i>Meyer,</i> 510 U.S. 471, 477 (1994) (noting that we interpret a statutory term in accordance with its ordinary meaning when that term is not defined in the statute). The term in controversy here is \"negligent transmission.\" The crux of my disagreement with the majority is its failure to assign the term \"transmission\" its plain meaning. That term is defined as the \"[a]ct, operation, or process, of transmitting.\" Webster's New International Dictionary 2692 (2d ed. 1934, as republished 1945). \"Transmit\" is defined as, <i>inter alia,</i> \"[t]o send or transfer from one person or place to another; to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*494</span> forward by rail, post, wire, etc., . . . [t]o cause . . . to pass or be conveyed.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 2692-2693. There is no cause to conclude that Congress was unaware of the ordinary definition of the terms \"transmission\" and \"transmit\" when it enacted the FTCA and the postal exception in 1946. Nor is there textual indication that Congress intended to deviate from the ordinary meaning of these terms.<sup>[1]</sup> Accordingly, I would interpret the term \"transmission\" consistent with its ordinary meaning, see <i>ante,</i> at 486, and conclude that the postal exception exempts the Government from liability for <i>any</i> claim arising out of the negligent delivery of the mail to a Postal Service patron, including Dolan's slip-and-fall claim.</p>\n<p>Rejecting the \"ordinary meaning and usage\" of \"negligent transmission,\" the majority concludes that the term covers only injury arising \"directly or consequentially\" from \"negligence causing mail to be lost or to arrive late, in damaged condition, or at the wrong address.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 486, 489. Thus, in the majority's view, \"negligent transmission\" covers direct injury to the mail as well as personal injury arising from injury to the mail, but does not cover personal injury that does not arise from damage to the mail. For example, in the majority's view, if a mail carrier negligently drops a box containing glassware on a patron's doorstep, causing the contents to shatter, and the patron later injures himself while attempting to handle the shards of glass, the postal exception would bar a claim for damages for the destroyed item as well as a related claim for personal injury. That <span class=\"star-pagination\">*495</span> view is correct, as far as it goes. However, under the majority's view, if the mail carrier negligently places a heap of mail on a patron's front porch and the patron trips and falls over the mail as he walks out of his front door, his personal injury claim may go forward. There is no basis in the text for the line drawn by the majority. Indeed, the majority's view is at odds with the broad language of the postal exception, which expressly applies to <i>\"[a]ny claim</i> arising out of . . . negligent transmission of letters or postal matter.\" \u0e07 2680(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The majority rationalizes its view by concluding that the terms \"loss\" and \"miscarriage\" necessarily limit the term \"transmission.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 486. Applying the rule of <i>noscitur a sociis</i>\u0e42\u0080\u0094that a word is known by the company it keeps\u0e42\u0080\u0094 the majority reasons that because both \"loss\" and \"miscarriage\" refer to \"failings in the postal obligation to deliver mail in a timely manner to the right address, it would be odd if `negligent transmission' swept far more broadly.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 487. But there is nothing \"odd\" about interpreting the term \"negligent transmission\" to encompass more ground than the decidedly narrower terms \"loss\" and \"miscarriage.\"</p>\n<p>The rule of <i>noscitur a sociis</i> is intended to prevent ascribing to one word a meaning so expansive that it conflicts with other terms of the provision in a manner that gives \"`unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.'\" <i>Gustafson</i> v. <i>Alloyd Co.,</i> 513 U.S. 561, 575 (1995) (quoting <i>Jarecki</i> v. <i>G. D. Searle &amp; Co.,</i> 367 U.S. 303, 307 (1961)). That rule, however, \"does not require [the Court] to construe every term in a series narrowly because of the meaning given to just one of the terms,\" where, as here, nothing in the text demands a more limited construction. <i>Gustafson, supra,</i> at 586 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (emphasis deleted). Indeed, to read Congress' use of narrow terms in a list as limiting the meaning of broad terms in the same list \"would defy common sense; doing so would prevent Congress from giving effect to expansive words in a list whenever they are combined <span class=\"star-pagination\">*496</span> with one word with a more restricted meaning.\" 513 U.S., at 587.</p>\n<p>Nor does this Court's opinion in <i>Kosak</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 465 U.S. 848 (1984), support the majority's narrow construction of the postal exception. In <i>Kosak,</i> this Court suggested that the postal exception does not apply to suits arising from the negligent handling of motor vehicles by Postal Service employees. Specifically, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"One of the principal purposes of the [FTCA] was to waive the Government's immunity from liability for injuries resulting from <i>auto accidents</i>.... In order to ensure that \u0e07 2680(b) ... did not have the effect of barring precisely the sort of suit that Congress was most concerned to authorize, the draftsmen of the provision carefully delineated the types of misconduct for which the Government was not assuming financial responsibility\u0e42\u0080\u0094namely, `the loss, miscarriage, <i>or</i> negligent transmission of letters or postal matter' . . . .\" <i>Id.,</i> at 855 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>That observation has no import beyond the recognition that the postal exception\u0e42\u0080\u0094whatever its scope may be\u0e42\u0080\u0094was carefully crafted so as not to undermine an undisputed principal purpose of the FTCA\u0e42\u0080\u0094to waive the Government's immunity for injuries arising from <i>auto accidents.</i> It says nothing further about the acts Congress intended to capture when enacting the postal exception, and, thus, is unremarkable for purposes of construing the exception.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*497</span> Even if <i>Kosak</i> does inform the outcome in this case, it does not support the majority's interpretation of \"negligent transmission.\" As discussed above, the majority does not purport to limit the type of negligent <i>act</i> that may fall under the postal exception; rather it limits the scope of the exception based on the type of <i>consequence</i> that the negligent act causes (damage to the mail, late delivery, etc.). But <i>Kosak</i>'s exclusion of the <i>act</i> of negligent driving\u0e42\u0080\u0094regardless of whether the <i>consequence</i> of that act is damage to the mail or injury to a person\u0e42\u0080\u0094from the scope of the postal exception implies, if anything, that the <i>Kosak</i> Court envisioned discrete <i>acts</i> as being covered, independently of the nature of their consequences. See <i>ibid.</i> (excluding \"negligent handling of motor vehicles\" from the \"types of misconduct\" for which liability is barred by the postal exception). As such, <i>Kosak</i> does not support an interpretation of \"negligent transmission\" based upon the type of injury that is caused by the Postal Service's negligent handling of the mail.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Assuming that the postal exception is ambiguous, as the majority suggests, see <i>ante,</i> at 486-487, settled principles <span class=\"star-pagination\">*498</span> governing the interpretation of waivers of sovereign immunity require us to rule in favor of the Government.</p>\n<p>A court may only exercise jurisdiction over the Government pursuant to \"a clear statement from the United States waiving sovereign immunity . . . together with a claim falling within the terms of the waiver.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>White Mountain Apache Tribe,</i> 537 U.S. 465, 472 (2003). \"[A] waiver of the Government's sovereign immunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.\" <i>Lane</i> v. <i>Pen\u0e51a,</i> 518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996). These settled legal principles apply not only to the interpretation of the scope of the Government's waiver of immunity, but also to the interpretation of the scope of any exceptions to that waiver. See <i>ibid.</i> (explaining that, consistent with rules of construction respecting waivers of sovereign immunity, ambiguities created by conditions on and qualifications of the waiver must be strictly construed in favor of sovereign immunity).</p>\n<p>Thus, the majority is incorrect to conclude that \"this case does not implicate the general rule that `a waiver of the Government's sovereign immunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 491. As this case clearly illustrates, the Government's amenability to suit can only be ascertained after construing both the waiver of immunity and its exceptions. The well-established rationale for construing a waiver in favor of the sovereign's immunity, thus, applies with equal force to the construction of an exception to that waiver. Accordingly, even if I were to conclude that the majority's interpretation of \"negligent transmission\" were as plausible as my own, I would still resolve this case in favor of the Government's sovereign immunity as mandated by our canons of construction.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*499</span> * * *</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, I would hold that a tort claim for personal injury arising out of negligent delivery of mail to a postal patron is barred by 28 U.S.C. \u0e07 2680(b), the postal exception. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  <i>Harold Krent, Daniel J. Popeo,</i> and <i>Paul D. Kamenar</i> filed a brief for the Washington Legal Foundation et al. as <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal.</p>\n<p>[1]  In fact, this reading is supported by Congress' routine definitional use of the terms \"transmission\" and \"transmit\" in both criminal and civil postal statutes to refer to the handling, processing, and delivery of mail to a final destination. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Act of Mar. 3, 1845, ch. 43, \u0e07 6, 5 Stat. 734 (respecting deputy postmasters authorized \"to transmit to any person or place\" official letters or packages free of charge); 18 U.S.C. \u0e07\u0e07 1696(b) and (c) (referring to unlawful \"transmission\" of letters); \u0e07\u0e07 1716(b), (c), (d), and (e) (regulating and proscribing \"transmission in the mails\" of dangerous items (<i>e. g.,</i> medicines) except when the \"transmission\" is \"to,\" \"from,\" or \"between\" specified individuals or entities).</p>\n<p>[2]  In an attempt to reconcile <i>Kosak</i> with this case, the majority argues that \"one purpose of the FTCA exceptions was to avoid `extending the coverage of the Act to suits for which adequate remedies were already available,'... an objective consistent with retaining immunity as to [some] claims of mail damage or delay covered by postal registration and insurance.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 490-491 (quoting <i>Kosak,</i> 465 U.S., at 858). The majority, however, ignores the fact that, in most cases, such insurance covers only the sender, not the recipient, in which case recipients have no means of obtaining compensation for loss or damage to money, gifts, heirlooms, valuable papers, delayed medicine, or time-sensitive documents. See United States Postal Service, Mailing Standards, Domestic Mail Manual 609.4.3(f) and (ae), pp. 1129, 1130 (rev. Jan. 6, 2005). The majority's justification also fails to take into account the fact that postal patrons cannot insure against the loss of items of sentimental value. See 609.4.3, generally. With a more accurate depiction of registration and insurance coverage in hand, the Government's claim that, like injuries arising from negligent transmission of mail, other injuries outside the reach of the FTCA are also amenable to administrative relief is not so easily dismissed. <i>Ante,</i> at 491. Specifically, 39 U.S.C. \u0e07 2603, as the Government argues, provides for the settlement of claims, within the discretion of the United States, for injuries caused by the Postal Service that are not otherwise cognizable, which would include claims like Dolan's. The discretionary nature of such settlements does not alter the fact that \u0e07 2603 undermines the Court's position that the purported unavailability of administrative recovery for claims such as Dolan's supports its proposed interpretation.</p>\n<p>[3]  There is no canon of construction that counsels in favor of construing the ambiguity against the Government. Although we have \"on occasion narrowly construed exceptions to waivers of sovereign immunity,\" we have done so in cases where Congress plainly waived the Government's immunity for the particular claim at issue, and the only question before the Court was the permissibility of the form of the suit. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Nordic Village, Inc.,</i> 503 U.S. 30, 34 (1992) (citing <i>United States</i> v. <i>Yellow Cab Co.,</i> 340 U.S. 543 (1951), and <i>United States</i> v. <i>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co.,</i> 338 U.S. 366 (1949)). In cases where, as here, the question whether a particular claim is subject to an exception is disputed, we have construed FTCA exceptions broadly to preclude claims for actions Congress intended to except from the FTCA's general waiver of immunity. See <i>Dalehite</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 346 U.S. 15, 31 (1953); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Orleans,</i> 425 U.S. 807 (1976); <i>Kosak</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 465 U.S. 848 (1984).</p>\n\n</div>",

UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n No. 04\u2013848.      Argued November 7, 2005\u2014Decided February 22, 2006\nUnder the Postal Reorganization Act, the Federal Tort Claims Act\n (FTCA) applies to \u201ctort claims arising out of [Postal Service] activi-\n ties.\u201d 39 U. S. C. \u00a7409(c). The FTCA, in turn, waives sovereign im-\n munity in certain cases involving negligence committed by federal\n employees in the course of their employment, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71346(b)(1),\n making the United States liable \u201cin the same manner and to the\n same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,\u201d \u00a72674.\n However, the sovereign immunity bar remains as to, inter alia, \u201c[a]ny\n claim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of\n letters or postal matter.\u201d \u00a72680(b). Consequently, the United States\n may be liable if postal workers commit torts under local law, but not\n for claims defined by the exception. Petitioner Dolan filed an FTCA\n suit against the Postal Service for injuries she suffered when she\n tripped and fell over mail left on her porch by postal employees. The\n District Court dismissed the suit, and the Third Circuit affirmed,\n both concluding that, although the FTCA generally waives sovereign\n immunity as to federal employees\u2019 torts, Dolan\u2019s claims were barred\n by \u00a72680(b)\u2019s exception.\nHeld: Because the postal exception is inapplicable in this case, Dolan\u2019s\n claim may go forward. This Court assumes that under the applicable\n state law a person injured by tripping over a package or bundle neg-\n ligently left by a private party would have a cause of action for dam-\n ages. The question is whether \u00a72860(b)\u2019s exception preserves sover-\n eign immunity in such a case. Considered in isolation, \u201cnegligent\n transmission\u201d could embrace a wide range of acts. However, inter-\n pretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statu-\n tory text, considering the statute\u2019s purpose and context. Here, both\n context and precedent require reading the phrase so that it does not\n2                      DOLAN v. POSTAL SERVICE\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    go beyond negligence causing mail to be lost or to arrive late, in dam-\n    aged condition, or at the wrong address. Starting with context, \u201cneg-\n    ligent transmission\u201d follows the terms \u201closs\u201d and \u201cmiscarriage,\u201d which\n    limit the reach of transmission. Mail is \u201clost\u201d if it is destroyed or\n    misplaced and \u201cmiscarried\u201d if it goes to the wrong address. Since\n    both terms refer to failings in the postal obligation to deliver mail in\n    a timely manner to the right address, it would be odd if \u201cnegligent\n    transmission\u201d swept far more broadly to include injuries caused by\n    postal employees but involving neither failure to transmit mail nor\n    damage to its contents. This interpretation is supported by Kosak v.\n    United States, 465 U. S. 848, where this Court noted that one of the\n    FTCA\u2019s purposes was to waive the Government\u2019s immunity from li-\n    ability for injuries resulting from auto accidents involving postal\n    trucks delivering\u2014and thus \u201ctransmitting\u201d\u2014the mail. Nothing in\n    the statutory text supports a distinction between negligent driving,\n    which the Government claims relates only circumstantially to the\n    mail, and Dolan\u2019s accident, which was caused by the mail itself. In\n    both cases the postal employee acts negligently while transmitting\n    mail. In addition, focusing on whether the mail itself caused the in-\n    jury would yield anomalies, perhaps making liability turn on, e.g.,\n    whether a mail sack was empty or full. It is more likely that Con-\n    gress intended to retain immunity only for injuries arising because\n    mail either fails to arrive or arrives late, in damaged condition, or at\n    the wrong address, since such harms are primarily identified with\n    the Postal Service\u2019s function of transporting mail. The Government\n    claims that, given the Postal Service\u2019s vast operations, Congress\n    must have intended to insulate delivery-related torts from liability,\n    but \u00a72680(b)\u2019s specificity indicates otherwise. Had Congress intended\n    to preserve immunity for all delivery-related torts, it could have used\n    sweeping language similar to that used in other FTCA exceptions,\n    e.g., \u00a72860(i). Furthermore, losses of the type for which immunity is\n    retained under \u00a72680(b) are at least to some degree avoidable or\n    compensable through postal registration and insurance. The Gov-\n    ernment raises the specter of frivolous slip-and-fall claims inundating\n    the Postal Service, but that is a risk shared by any business making\n    home deliveries. Finally, the general rule that a sovereign immunity\n    waiver \u201cwill be strictly construed . . . in favor of the sovereign,\u201d Lane\n    v. Pe\u00f1a, 518 U. S. 187, 192, is \u201cunhelpful\u201d in the FTCA context,\n    where \u201cunduly generous interpretations of the exceptions run the\n    risk of defeating\u201d the central purpose of the statute, Kosak, supra, at\n    853, n. 9, which \u201cwaives the Government\u2019s immunity from suit in\n    sweeping language,\u201d United States v.

UNITED STATES\n           POSTAL SERVICE ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n                             [February 22, 2006]\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Each day, according to the Government\u2019s submissions\nhere, the United States Postal Service delivers some 660\nmillion pieces of mail to as many as 142 million delivery\npoints. This case involves one such delivery point\u2014\npetitioner Barbara Dolan\u2019s porch\u2014where mail left by\npostal employees allegedly caused her to trip and fall.\nClaiming injuries as a result, Dolan filed a claim for ad-\nministrative relief from the Postal Service. When her\nclaim was denied, she and her husband (whose claim for\nloss of consortium the Dolans later conceded was barred\nfor failure to exhaust administrative remedies) filed suit\nin the United States District Court for the Eastern Dis-\ntrict of Pennsylvania, asserting that the Postal Service\u2019s\nnegligent placement of mail at their home subjected the\nGovernment to liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act\n(FTCA), 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71346(b)(1), 2674. The District Court\ndismissed Dolan\u2019s suit, and the Court of Appeals for the\nThird Circuit affirmed, 377 F. 3d 285 (2004). Both courts\nconcluded that, although the FTCA generally waives\nsovereign immunity as to federal employees\u2019 torts, Dolan\u2019s\n2                DOLAN v. POSTAL SERVICE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nclaims were barred by an exception to that waiver, 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72680(b). We disagree and hold that Dolan\u2019s suit\nmay proceed.\n                               I\n  Under the Postal Reorganization Act, 39 U. S. C. \u00a7101 et\nseq., the Postal Service is \u201can independent establishment\nof the executive branch of the Government of the United\nStates,\u201d \u00a7201. Holding a monopoly over carriage of letters,\nthe Postal Service has \u201csignificant governmental powers,\u201d\nincluding the power of eminent domain, the authority to\nmake searches and seizures in the enforcement of laws\nprotecting the mails, the authority to promulgate postal\nregulations, and, subject to the Secretary of State\u2019s super-\nvision, the power to enter international postal agreements.\nSee Postal Service v. Flamingo Industries (USA) Ltd., 540\nU. S. 736, 741 (2004) (discussing 39 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7101, 401, 407,\n601\u2013606). Consistent with this status, the Postal Service\nenjoys federal sovereign immunity absent a waiver. See\nibid.; cf. FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U. S. 471, 475 (1994) (\u201cAbsent a\nwaiver, sovereign immunity shields the Federal Govern-\nment and its agencies from suit\u201d).\n  Although the Postal Reorganization Act generally\n\u201cwaives the immunity of the Postal Service from suit by\ngiving it the power \u2018to sue and be sued in its official\nname,\u2019 \u201d Flamingo Industries, supra, at 741 (quoting 39\nU. S. C. \u00a7401(1)), the statute also provides that the FTCA\n\u201cshall apply to tort claims arising out of activities of the\nPostal Service,\u201d \u00a7409(c).\n  The FTCA, in turn, waives sovereign immunity in two\ndifferent sections of the United States Code. The first\nconfers federal-court jurisdiction in a defined category of\ncases involving negligence committed by federal employees\nin the course of their employment. This jurisdictional\ngrant covers:\n    \u201cclaims against the United States, for money dam-\n                  Cite as: 546 U.

S. C. \u00a71346(b)(1).\nAs to claims falling within this jurisdictional grant, the\nFTCA, in a second provision, makes the United States liable\n\u201cin the same manner and to the same extent as a private\nindividual under like circumstances,\u201d though not \u201cfor\ninterest prior to judgment or for punitive damages.\u201d\n\u00a72674; see generally United States v. Olson, 546 U. S. ___ ,\n___ (2005) (slip op., at 1).\n   The FTCA qualifies its waiver of sovereign immunity for\ncertain categories of claims (13 in all). If one of the excep-\ntions applies, the bar of sovereign immunity remains. The\n13 categories of exempted claims are set forth in 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72680, and the relevant subsection for our pur-\nposes, pertaining to postal operations, is \u00a72680(b). It\nstates:\n    \u201cThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of\n    this title shall not apply to . . . [a]ny claim arising out\n    of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of\n    letters or postal matter.\u201d\nAs a consequence, the United States may be liable if postal\nemployees commit torts under local law, but not for claims\ndefined by this exception.\n  This was the provision relied upon by the District Court\nand Court of Appeals to dismiss Dolan\u2019s suit. The Court of\nAppeals\u2019 decision created a conflict with a decision of the\nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit. See Raila v.\nUnited States, 355 F. 3d 118, 121 (CA2 2004). We granted\n4                DOLAN v. POSTAL SERVICE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncertiorari. 544 U. S. ___ (2005).\n                               II\n   We assume that under the applicable state law a person\ninjured by tripping over a package or bundle of papers\nnegligently left on the porch of a residence by a private\nparty would have a cause of action for damages. See 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71346(b)(1), 2674. The question is whether,\nwhen mail left by the Postal Service causes the slip and\nfall, the \u00a72680(b) exception for \u201closs, miscarriage, or negli-\ngent transmission of letters or postal matter\u201d preserves\nsovereign immunity despite the FTCA\u2019s more general\nstatements of waiver.\n   If considered in isolation, the phrase \u201cnegligent trans-\nmission\u201d could embrace a wide range of negligent acts\ncommitted by the Postal Service in the course of delivering\nmail, including creation of slip-and-fall hazards from\nleaving packets and parcels on the porch of a residence.\nAfter all, in ordinary meaning and usage, transmission of\nthe mail is not complete until it arrives at the destination.\nSee, e.g., Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary\n2429 (1971) (defining \u201ctransmission\u201d as \u201can act, process, or\ninstance of transmitting\u201d and \u201ctransmit\u201d as \u201cto cause to go\nor be conveyed to another person or place\u201d). In large part\nthis inference\u2014transmission includes delivery\u2014led the\nDistrict Court and Court of Appeals to rule for the Gov-\nernment. See 377 F. 3d, at 288; App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a\u2013\n6a. The definition of words in isolation, however, is not\nnecessarily controlling in statutory construction. A word\nin a statute may or may not extend to the outer limits of\nits definitional possibilities. Interpretation of a word or\nphrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text,\nconsidering the purpose and context of the statute, and\nconsulting any precedents or authorities that inform the\nanalysis. Here, we conclude both context and precedent\nrequire a narrower reading, so that \u201cnegligent transmis-\n                 Cite as: 546 U.

See Raila, supra, at 121 (holding the postal\nexception covers \u201cdamages and delay of the postal mate-\nrial itself and consequential damages therefrom\u201d). The\nphrase does not comprehend all negligence occurring in\nthe course of mail delivery.\n   Starting with context, the words \u201cnegligent transmis-\nsion\u201d in \u00a72680(b) follow two other terms, \u201closs\u201d and \u201cmis-\ncarriage.\u201d Those terms, we think, limit the reach of\n\u201ctransmission.\u201d \u201c[A] word is known by the company it\nkeeps\u201d\u2014a rule that \u201cis often wisely applied where a word\nis capable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of\nunintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.\u201d Jarecki v.\nG. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961); see also Dole\nv. Steelworkers, 494 U. S. 26, 36 (1990) (\u201c[W]ords grouped in\na list should be given related meaning\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). Here, as both parties acknowledge, mail\nis \u201clost\u201d if it is destroyed or misplaced and \u201cmiscarried\u201d if\nit goes to the wrong address. Since both those terms refer\nto failings in the postal obligation to deliver mail in a\ntimely manner to the right address, it would be odd if\n\u201cnegligent transmission\u201d swept far more broadly to include\ninjuries like those alleged here\u2014injuries that happen to be\ncaused by postal employees but involve neither failure to\ntransmit mail nor damage to its contents.\n   Our interpretation would be less secure were it not for a\nprecedent we deem to have decisive weight here. We refer\nto Kosak v. United States, 465 U. S. 848 (1984). In Kosak,\nan art collector alleged in an FTCA suit that artworks he\nowned were damaged when the United States Customs\nService seized and detained them. Id., at 849\u2013850. The\nquestion was whether the Government retained immunity\nbased on \u00a72680(c), a provision that has since been\namended but at the time covered:\n6               DOLAN v. POSTAL SERVICE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    \u201c[a]ny claim arising in respect of the assessment or\n    collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention\n    of any goods or merchandise by any officer of customs\n    or excise or any other law-enforcement officer.\u201d Id., at\n    852, n. 6 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nIn its opinion concluding the exception did apply and thus\nthat the United States retained sovereign immunity, the\nCourt gave specific consideration to the postal exception.\nIn a part of the opinion central to its holding, the Court\ncontrasted what it called the \u201cgenerality of \u00a72680(c)\u201d with\nthe \u201cspecificity of \u00a72680(b),\u201d id., at 855. The Court ob-\nserved:\n    \u201cOne of the principal purposes of the Federal Tort\n    Claims Act was to waive the Government\u2019s immunity\n    from liability for injuries resulting from auto acci-\n    dents in which employees of the Postal System were\n    at fault. In order to ensure that \u00a72680(b), which gov-\n    erns torts committed by mailmen, did not have the ef-\n    fect of barring precisely the sort of suit that Congress\n    was most concerned to authorize, the draftsmen of the\n    provision carefully delineated the types of misconduct\n    for which the Government was not assuming financial\n    responsibility\u2014namely, \u2018the loss, miscarriage, or neg-\n    ligent transmission of letters or postal matter\u2019\u2014\n    thereby excluding, by implication, negligent handling\n    of motor vehicles.\u201d Ibid.\n  In the present case neither party suggests Kosak\u2019s con-\nclusion regarding negligent operation of postal motor\nvehicles should be ignored as dictum. In light of Kosak\u2019s\ndiscussion, we cannot interpret the phrase \u201cnegligent\ntransmission\u201d in \u00a72680(b) to cover all negligence in the\ncourse of mail delivery. Although postal trucks may well\nbe delivering\u2014and thus transmitting\u2014mail when they\ncollide with other vehicles, Kosak indicates the United\nStates, nonetheless, retains no immunity.\n                 Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Seeking to distinguish postal auto accidents from Do-\nlan\u2019s fall, the Government argues that negligent driving\nrelates only circumstantially to the mail, whereas Dolan\u2019s\naccident was caused by the mail itself. Nothing in the\nstatutory text supports this distinction. Quite the con-\ntrary, if placing mail so as to create a slip-and-fall risk\nconstitutes \u201cnegligent transmission,\u201d the same should be\ntrue of driving postal trucks in a manner that endangers\nothers on the road. In both cases the postal employee acts\nnegligently while transmitting mail. In addition, as the\nSecond Circuit recognized and as the Government ac-\nknowledged at oral argument, focusing on whether the\nmail itself caused the injury would yield anomalies, per-\nhaps making liability turn on whether a mail sack causing\na slip-and-fall was empty or full, or whether a pedestrian\nsideswiped by a passing truck was hit by the side-view\nmirror or a dangling parcel. See Raila, 355 F. 3d, at 122\u2013\n123.\n   We think it more likely that Congress intended to retain\nimmunity, as a general rule, only for injuries arising,\ndirectly or consequentially, because mail either fails to\narrive at all or arrives late, in damaged condition, or at\nthe wrong address. Illustrative instances of the excep-\ntion\u2019s operation, then, would be personal or financial\nharms arising from nondelivery or late delivery of sensi-\ntive materials or information (e.g., medicines or a mort-\ngage foreclosure notice) or from negligent handling of a\nmailed parcel (e.g., shattering of shipped china). Such\nharms, after all, are the sort primarily identified with the\nPostal Service\u2019s function of transporting mail throughout\nthe United States.\n   Resisting this conclusion, the Government emphasizes\nthe Postal Service\u2019s vast operations\u2014the 660 million daily\nmailings and 142 million delivery points mentioned at the\noutset. See Brief for Respondents 36. As delivery to\nmailboxes and doorsteps is essential to this nationwide\n8                 DOLAN v. POSTAL SERVICE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nundertaking, Congress must have intended, the Govern-\nment asserts, to insulate delivery-related torts from liabil-\nity. If, however, doorstep delivery is essential to the postal\nenterprise, then driving postal trucks is no less so. And in\nany event, while it is true \u201c[t]he \u00a72680 exceptions are\ndesigned to protect certain important governmental func-\ntions and prerogatives from disruption,\u201d Molzof v. United\nStates, 502 U. S. 301, 311 (1992), the specificity of \u00a72680(b),\nsee Kosak, 465 U. S., at 855, indicates that Congress did\nnot intend to immunize all postal activities.\n   Other FTCA exceptions paint with a far broader brush.\nThey cover, for example: \u201c[a]ny claim for damages caused\nby the fiscal operations of the Treasury or by the regula-\ntion of the monetary system,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72680(i); \u201c[a]ny\nclaim arising out of the combatant activities of the mili-\ntary or naval forces, or the Coast Guard, during time of\nwar,\u201d \u00a72680(j); \u201c[a]ny claim arising in a foreign country,\u201d\n\u00a72680(k); \u201c[a]ny claim arising from the activities of the\nTennessee Valley Authority,\u201d \u00a72680(l), or \u201cthe Panama\nCanal Company,\u201d \u00a72680(m); and \u201c[a]ny claim arising from\nthe activities of a Federal land bank, a Federal intermedi-\nate credit bank, or a bank for cooperatives,\u201d \u00a72680(n). Had\nCongress intended to preserve immunity for all torts\nrelated to postal delivery\u2014torts including hazardous mail\nplacement at customer homes\u2014it could have used simi-\nlarly sweeping language in \u00a72680(b). By instead \u201ccarefully\ndelineat[ing]\u201d just three types of harm (loss, miscarriage,\nand negligent transmission), see Kosak, supra, at 855,\nCongress expressed the intent to immunize only a subset\nof postal wrongdoing, not all torts committed in the course\nof mail delivery.\n   Further supporting our interpretation, losses of the type\nfor which immunity is retained under \u00a72680(b) are at least\nto some degree avoidable or compensable through postal\nregistration and insurance.

The\nsame was true when Congress enacted the FTCA in 1946.\nSee 39 U. S. C. \u00a7245 (1940 ed. and Supp. V) (setting rates\nand conditions for mail insurance); 39 U. S. C. \u00a7381 (1946\ned.)

POSTAL SERVICE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Government raises the specter of frivolous slip-and-\nfall claims inundating the Postal Service. It is true that,\nin addition to other considerations we have identified,\nKosak describes \u201cavoiding exposure of the United States to\nliability for excessive or fraudulent claims\u201d as a principal\naim of the FTCA exceptions, 465 U. S., at 858. Slip-and-\nfall liability, however, to the extent state tort law imposes\nit, is a risk shared by any business that makes home\ndeliveries. Given that \u201cnegligent transmission,\u201d viewed in\ncontext and in light of Kosak, cannot sweep as broadly as\nthe Government claims, ordinary protections against\nfrivolous litigation must suffice here, just as they do in the\ncase of motor vehicle collisions.\n   Finally, it should be noted that this case does not impli-\ncate the general rule that \u201ca waiver of the Government\u2019s\nsovereign immunity will be strictly construed, in terms of\nits scope, in favor of the sovereign,\u201d Lane v. Pe\u00f1a, 518 U. S.\n187, 192 (1996). As Kosak explains, this principle is \u201cun-\nhelpful\u201d in the FTCA context, where \u201cunduly generous\ninterpretations of the exceptions run the risk of defeating\nthe central purpose of the statute,\u201d 465 U. S., at 853, n. 9,\nwhich \u201cwaives the Government\u2019s immunity from suit in\nsweeping language,\u201d United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 340\nU. S. 543, 547 (1951); see also United States v. Nordic Vil-\nlage, Inc., 503 U.

Even if the\nexception is ambiguous, this Court\u2019s cases require that\nambiguities as to the scope of the Government\u2019s waiver of\nimmunity be resolved in its favor. Accordingly, I respect-\nfully dissent.\n                              I\n  The text of the postal exception, and every term therein,\nshould be ascribed its ordinary meaning. See FDIC v.\nMeyer, 510 U. S. 471, 477 (1994) (noting that we interpret\na statutory term in accordance with its ordinary meaning\nwhen that term is not defined in the statute). The term in\ncontroversy here is \u201cnegligent transmission.\u201d The crux of\nmy disagreement with the majority is its failure to assign\nthe term \u201ctransmission\u201d its plain meaning. That term is\ndefined as the \u201c[a]ct, operation, or process, of transmit-\nting.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 2692 (2d\ned. 1934, as republished 1945). \u201cTransmit\u201d is defined as,\ninter alia, \u201c[t]o send or transfer from one person or place\nto another; to forward by rail, post, wire, etc., . . . [t]o\ncause . . . to pass or be conveyed.\u201d Id., at 2692\u20132693.\nThere is no cause to conclude that Congress was unaware\nof the ordinary definition of the terms \u201ctransmission\u201d and\n\u201ctransmit\u201d when it enacted the FTCA and the postal ex-\nception in 1946. Nor is there textual indication that Con-\ngress intended to deviate from the ordinary meaning of\nthese terms.1 Accordingly, I would interpret the term\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 In fact, this reading is supported by Congress\u2019 routine definitional\n\nuse of the terms \u201ctransmission\u201d and \u201ctransmit\u201d in both criminal and\ncivil postal statutes to refer to the handling, processing, and delivery of\nmail to a final destination.

Thus, in the majority\u2019s view, \u201cnegligent transmis-\nsion\u201d covers direct injury to the mail as well as personal\ninjury arising from injury to the mail, but does not cover\npersonal injury that does not arise from damage to the\nmail. For example, in the majority\u2019s view, if a mail carrier\nnegligently drops a mailbox containing glassware on a\npatron\u2019s doorstep, causing the contents to shatter, and the\npatron later injures himself while attempting to handle\nthe shards of glass, the postal exception would bar a claim\nfor damages for the destroyed item as well as a related\nclaim for personal injury. That view is correct, as far as it\ngoes. However, under the majority\u2019s view, if the mail\ncarrier negligently places a heap of mail on a patron\u2019s\nfront porch and the patron trips and falls over the mail as\nhe walks out of his front door, his personal injury claim\nmay go forward. There is no basis in the text for the line\ndrawn by the majority. Indeed, the majority\u2019s view is at\nodds with the broad language of the postal exception,\nwhich expressly applies to \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of . . .\nnegligent transmission of letters or postal matter.\u201d\n\u00a72680(b) (emphasis added).\n  The majority rationalizes its view by concluding that the\nterms \u201closs\u201d and \u201cmiscarriage\u201d necessarily limit the term\n\u201ctransmission.\u201d Ante, at 5.

Gustaf-\nson, supra, at 586 (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (emphasis\ndeleted). Indeed, to read Congress\u2019 use of narrow terms in a\nlist as limiting the meaning of broad terms in the same list\n\u201cwould defy common sense; doing so would prevent Con-\ngress from giving effect to expansive words in a list when-\never they are combined with one word with a more re-\nstricted meaning.\u201d Id., at 587.\n   Nor does this Court\u2019s opinion in Kosak v.

Id., at 855\n     (emphasis added).\nThat observation has no import beyond the recognition\nthat the postal exception\u2014whatever its scope may be\u2014\nwas carefully crafted so as not to undermine an undis-\nputed principal purpose of the FTCA\u2014to waive the Gov-\nernment\u2019s immunity for injuries arising from auto acci-\ndents. It says nothing further about the acts Congress\nintended to capture when enacting the postal exception,\nand, thus, is unremarkable for purposes of construing the\nexception. 2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 In an attempt to reconcile Kosak with this case, the majority argues\nthat \u201cone purpose of the FTCA exceptions was to avoid \u2018extending\ncoverage of the Act to suits for which adequate remedies were already\navailable,\u2019 . . . an objective consistent with retaining immunity as to\nsome claims of mail damage or delay covered by postal registration and\ninsurance.\u201d Ante, at 9 (quoting Kosak, 465 U. S., at 858). The majority,\nhowever, ignores the fact that, in most cases, such insurance covers\nonly the sender, not the recipient, in which case recipients have no\nmeans of obtaining compensation for loss or damage to money, gifts,\nheirlooms, valuable papers, delayed medicine, or time-sensitive docu-\nments. See United States Postal Service, Mailing Standards of the\nUnited States Postal Service, Domestic Mail Manual, \u00a7\u00a7609.4.3(f) and\n(ae), pp. 1129, 1130 (rev. Jan. 6, 2005). The majority\u2019s justification also\nfails to take into account the fact that postal patrons cannot insure\nagainst the loss of items of sentimental value. See id., \u00a7609.4.3, gener-\nally. With a more accurate depiction of registration and insurance\ncoverage in hand, the Government\u2019s claim that, like injuries arising\nfrom negligent transmission of mail, other injuries outside the reach of\nthe FTCA are also amenable to administrative relief is not so easily\ndismissed. Ante, at 9. Specifically, 39 U. S. C. \u00a72603, as the Govern-\nment argues, provides for the settlement of claims, within the discre-\n6                   DOLAN v. POSTAL SERVICE\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n  Even if Kosak does inform the outcome in this case, it\ndoes not support the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u201cnegligent\ntransmission.\u201d As discussed above, the majority does not\npurport to limit the type of negligent act that may fall\nunder the postal exception; rather it limits the scope of the\nexception based on the type of consequence that the negli-\ngent act causes (damage to the mail, late delivery, etc.)\nBut Kosak\u2019s exclusion of the act of negligent driving\u2014\nregardless of whether the consequence of that act is dam-\nage to the mail or injury to a person\u2014from the scope of the\npostal exception implies, if anything, that the Kosak Court\nenvisioned discrete acts as being covered, independently of\nthe nature of their consequences. See 465 U. S., at 855\n(excluding \u201cnegligent handling of motor vehicles\u201d from the\n\u201ctypes of misconduct\u201d for which liability is barred by the\npostal exception). As such, Kosak does not support an\ninterpretation of \u201cnegligent transmission\u201d based upon the\ntype of injury that is caused by the Postal Service\u2019s negli-\ngent handling of the mail.\n                             II\n  Assuming that the postal exception is ambiguous, as the\nmajority suggests, see ante, at 4\u20135, settled principles\ngoverning the interpretation of waivers of sovereign im-\nmunity require us to rule in favor of the Government.\n   A court may only exercise jurisdiction over the Gov-\nernment pursuant to \u201ca clear statement from the United\nStates waiving sovereign immunity . . . together with a\nclaim falling within the terms of the waiver.\u201d United\nStates v. White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U. S. 465, 472\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntion of the United States, for injuries caused by the Postal Service that\nare not otherwise cognizable, which would include claims like Dolan\u2019s.\nThe discretionary nature of such settlements does not alter the fact\nthat \u00a72603 undermines the Court\u2019s position that the purported un-\navailability of administrative recovery for claims such as Dolan\u2019s\nsupports its proposed interpretation.\n                     Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)                    7\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n(2003). \u201c[A] waiver of the Government\u2019s sovereign immu-\nnity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in\nfavor of the sovereign.\u201d Lane v. Pe\u00f1a, 518 U. S. 187, 192\n(1996). These settled legal principles apply not only to the\ninterpretation of the scope of the Government\u2019s waiver of\nimmunity, but also to the interpretation of the scope of\nany exceptions to that waiver. See ibid. (explaining that,\nconsistent with rules of construction respecting waivers of\nsovereign immunity, ambiguities created by conditions on\nand qualifications of the waiver must be strictly construed\nin favor of sovereign immunity).\n   Thus, the majority is incorrect to conclude that \u201cthis\ncase does not implicate the general rule that \u2018a waiver of\nthe Government\u2019s sovereign immunity will be strictly\nconstrued, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.\u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 10. As this case clearly illustrates, the Govern-\nment\u2019s amenability to suit can only be ascertained after\nconstruing both the waiver of immunity and its excep-\ntions. The well-established rationale for construing a\nwaiver in favor of the sovereign\u2019s immunity, thus, applies\nwith equal force to the construction of an exception to that\nwaiver. Accordingly, even if I were to conclude that the\nmajority\u2019s interpretation of \u201cnegligent transmission\u201d were\nas plausible as my own, I would still resolve this case in\nfavor of the Government\u2019s sovereign immunity as man-\ndated by our canons of construction.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 There is no canon of construction that counsels in favor of constru-\ning the ambiguity against the Government. Although we have \u201con\noccasion narrowly construed exceptions to waivers of sovereign immu-\nnity,\u201d we have done so in cases where Congress plainly waived the\nGovernment\u2019s immunity for the particular claim at issue, and the only\nquestion before the Court was the permissibility of the form of the suit.\nUnited States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 34 (1992) (citing\nUnited States v. Yellow Cab Co., 340 U. S. 543 (1951), and United\nStates v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 338 U. S. 366 (1949)). In cases\nwhere, as here, the question whether a particular claim is subject to an\nexception is disputed, we have construed FTCA exceptions broadly to\n8                  DOLAN v. POSTAL SERVICE\n\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                        *    *     *\n  For these reasons, I would hold that a tort claim for\npersonal injury arising out of negligent delivery of mail to\na postal patron is barred by 28 U. S. C. \u00a72680(b), the\npostal exception. Accordingly, I would affirm the judg-\nment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\npreclude claims for actions Congress intended to except from the\n\nFTCA\u2019s general waiver of immunity. See Dalehite v. United States, 346\n\nU. S. 15, 31 (1953); United States v. Orleans, 425 U. S. 807 (1976);\nKosak v. United States, 465 U. S. 848 (1984).\n",

This case involves one such delivery point\u0e42\u0080\u0094petitioner Barbara Dolan's porch\u0e42\u0080\u0094where mail left by postal employees allegedly caused her to trip and fall. Claiming injuries as a result, Dolan filed a claim for administrative relief from the Postal Service. When her claim was denied, she and her husband (whose claim for loss of consortium the Dolans later conceded was barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies) filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, asserting that the Postal Service's negligent placement of mail at their home subjected the Government to liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u0e07\u0e07 1346(b)(1), 2674. The District Court dismissed Dolan's suit, and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787106\"><a href=\"/opinion/787106/barbara-dolan-michael-dolan-wh-v-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></a></span> (2004). Both courts concluded that, although the FTCA generally waives sovereign immunity as to federal employees' torts, Dolan's claims were barred by an exception to that waiver, 28 U.S.C. \u0e07 2680(b). We disagree and hold that Dolan's suit may proceed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Under the Postal Reorganization Act, 39 U.S.C. \u0e07 101 <i>et seq.,</i> the Postal Service is \"an independent establishment of the executive branch of the Government of the United <span class=\"star-pagination\">*484</span> States,\" \u0e07 201. Holding a monopoly over carriage of letters, the Postal Service has \"significant governmental powers,\" including the power of eminent domain, the authority to make searches and seizures in the enforcement of laws protecting the mails, the authority to promulgate postal regulations, and, subject to the Secretary of State's supervision, the power to enter international postal agreements. See <i>Postal Service</i> v. <i>Flamingo Industries (USA) Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131167\"><a href=\"/opinion/131167/postal-service-v-flamingo-industries-usa-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">736</span></a></span>, 741 (2004) (discussing 39 U.S.C. \u0e07\u0e07 101, 401, 407, 601-606). Consistent with this status, the Postal Service enjoys federal sovereign immunity absent a waiver. See <i>ibid.;</i> cf. <i>FDIC</i> v. <i>Meyer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112931\"><a href=\"/opinion/112931/fdic-v-meyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span>, 475 (1994) (\"Absent a waiver, sovereign immunity shields the Federal Government and its agencies from suit\").</p>\n<p>Although the Postal Reorganization Act generally \"waives the immunity of the Postal Service from suit by giving it the power `to sue and be sued in its official name,'\" <i>Flamingo Industries, supra,</i> at 741 (quoting 39 U.S.C. \u0e07 401(1)), the statute also provides that the FTCA \"shall apply to tort claims arising out of activities of the Postal Service,\" \u0e07 409(c).</p>\n<p>The FTCA, in turn, waives sovereign immunity in two different sections of the United States Code. The first confers federal-court jurisdiction in a defined category of cases involving negligence committed by federal employees in the course of their employment. This jurisdictional grant covers:</p>\n<blockquote>\"claims against the United States, for money damages, accruing on and after January 1, 1945, for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\" 28 U.S.C. \u0e07 1346(b)(1).</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*485</span> As to claims falling within this jurisdictional grant, the FTCA, in a second provision, makes the United States liable \"in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,\" though not \"for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages.\" \u0e07 2674; see generally <i>United States</i> v. <i>Olson, ante,</i> at 44.</p>\n<p>The FTCA qualifies its waiver of sovereign immunity for certain categories of claims (13 in all). If one of the exceptions applies, the bar of sovereign immunity remains. The 13 categories of exempted claims are set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u0e07 2680, and the relevant subsection for our purposes, pertaining to postal operations, is \u0e07 2680(b). It states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall not apply to . . . [a]ny claim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter.\"</blockquote>\n<p>As a consequence, the United States may be liable if postal employees commit torts under local law, but not for claims defined by this exception.</p>\n<p>This was the provision relied upon by the District Court and Court of Appeals to dismiss Dolan's suit. The Court of Appeals' decision created a conflict with a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. See <i>Raila</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784762\"><a href=\"/opinion/784762/lenore-s-raila-whitton-a-raila-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span>, 121 (2004). We granted certiorari. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">998</span></span> (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We assume that under the applicable state law a person injured by tripping over a package or bundle of papers negligently left on the porch of a residence by a private party would have a cause of action for damages. See 28 U.S.C. \u0e07\u0e07 1346(b)(1), 2674. The question is whether, when mail left by the Postal Service causes the slip and fall, the \u0e07 2680(b) exception for \"loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter\" preserves sovereign immunity despite the FTCA's more general statements of waiver.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*486</span> If considered in isolation, the phrase \"negligent transmission\" could embrace a wide range of negligent acts committed by the Postal Service in the course of delivering mail, including creation of slip-and-fall hazards from leaving packets and parcels on the porch of a residence. After all, in ordinary meaning and usage, transmission of the mail is not complete until it arrives at the destination. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2429 (1971) (defining \"transmission\" as \"an act, process, or instance of transmitting\" and \"transmit\" as \"to cause to go or be conveyed to another person or place\"). In large part this inference\u0e42\u0080\u0094 transmission includes delivery\u0e42\u0080\u0094led the District Court and Court of Appeals to rule for the Government. See 377 F.3d, at 288; App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a-6a. The definition of words in isolation, however, is not necessarily controlling in statutory construction. A word in a statute may or may not extend to the outer limits of its definitional possibilities. Interpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text, considering the purpose and context of the statute, and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis. Here, we conclude both context and precedent require a narrower reading, so that \"negligent transmission\" does not go beyond negligence causing mail to be lost or to arrive late, in damaged condition, or at the wrong address. See <i>Raila, supra,</i> at 121 (holding the postal exception covers \"damages and delay of the postal material itself and consequential damages therefrom\"). The phrase does not comprehend all negligence occurring in the course of mail delivery.</p>\n<p>Starting with context, the words \"negligent transmission\" in \u0e07 2680(b) follow two other terms, \"loss\" and \"miscarriage.\" Those terms, we think, limit the reach of \"transmission.\" \"[A] word is known by the company it keeps\"\u0e42\u0080\u0094a rule that \"is often wisely applied where a word is capable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.\" <i>Jarecki</i> v. <i>G. D. Searle &amp; Co.,</i> 367 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*487</span> U.S. 303, 307 (1961); see also <i>Dole</i> v. <i>Steelworkers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112374\"><a href=\"/opinion/112374/dole-v-steelworkers/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 36 (1990) (\"[W]ords grouped in a list should be given related meaning\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Here, as both parties acknowledge, mail is \"lost\" if it is destroyed or misplaced and \"miscarried\" if it goes to the wrong address. Since both those terms refer to failings in the postal obligation to deliver mail in a timely manner to the right address, it would be odd if \"negligent transmission\" swept far more broadly to include injuries like those alleged here\u0e42\u0080\u0094 injuries that happen to be caused by postal employees but involve neither failure to transmit mail nor damage to its contents.</p>\n<p>Our interpretation would be less secure were it not for a precedent we deem to have decisive weight here. We refer to <i>Kosak</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111121\"><a href=\"/opinion/111121/kosak-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></a></span> (1984). In <i>Kosak,</i> an art collector alleged in an FTCA suit that artworks he owned were damaged when the United States Customs Service seized and detained them. <i>Id.,</i> at 849-850. The question was whether the Government retained immunity based on \u0e07 2680(c), a provision that has since been amended but at the time covered:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[a]ny claim arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any goods or merchandise by any officer of customs or excise or any other law-enforcement officer.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 852, n. 6 (internal quotation marks omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>In its opinion concluding the exception did apply and thus that the United States retained sovereign immunity, the Court gave specific consideration to the postal exception. In a part of the opinion central to its holding, the Court contrasted what it called the \"generality of \u0e07 2680(c)\" with the \"specificity of \u0e07 2680(b),\" <i>id.,</i> at 855. The Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote>\"One of the principal purposes of the Federal Tort Claims Act was to waive the Government's immunity from liability for injuries resulting from auto accidents <span class=\"star-pagination\">*488</span> in which employees of the Postal System were at fault. In order to ensure that \u0e07 2680(b), which governs torts committed by mailmen, did not have the effect of barring precisely the sort of suit that Congress was most concerned to authorize, the draftsmen of the provision carefully delineated the types of misconduct for which the Government was not assuming financial responsibility\u0e42\u0080\u0094namely, `the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter'\u0e42\u0080\u0094thereby excluding, by implication, negligent handling of motor vehicles.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>In the present case neither party suggests <i>Kosak</i>'s conclusion regarding negligent operation of postal motor vehicles should be ignored as dictum. In light of <i>Kosak</i>'s discussion, we cannot interpret the phrase \"negligent transmission\" in \u0e07 2680(b) to cover all negligence in the course of mail delivery. Although postal trucks may well be delivering\u0e42\u0080\u0094and thus transmitting\u0e42\u0080\u0094mail when they collide with other vehicles, <i>Kosak</i> indicates the United States, nonetheless, retains no immunity.</p>\n<p>Seeking to distinguish postal auto accidents from Dolan's fall, the Government argues that negligent driving relates only circumstantially to the mail, whereas Dolan's accident was caused by the mail itself. Nothing in the statutory text supports this distinction. Quite the contrary, if placing mail so as to create a slip-and-fall risk constitutes \"negligent transmission,\" the same should be true of driving postal trucks in a manner that endangers others on the road. In both cases the postal employee acts negligently while transmitting mail. In addition, as the Second Circuit recognized and as the Government acknowledged at oral argument, focusing on whether the mail itself caused the injury would yield anomalies, perhaps making liability turn on whether a mail sack causing a slip-and-fall was empty or full, or whether a pedestrian sideswiped by a passing truck was hit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*489</span> by the side-view mirror or a dangling parcel. See <i>Raila,</i> 355 F.3d, at 122-123.</p>\n<p>We think it more likely that Congress intended to retain immunity, as a general rule, only for injuries arising, directly or consequentially, because mail either fails to arrive at all or arrives late, in damaged condition, or at the wrong address. Illustrative instances of the exception's operation, then, would be personal or financial harms arising from nondelivery or late delivery of sensitive materials or information (<i>e. g.,</i> medicines or a mortgage foreclosure notice) or from negligent handling of a mailed parcel (<i>e. g.,</i> shattering of shipped china). Such harms, after all, are the sort primarily identified with the Postal Service's function of transporting mail throughout the United States.</p>\n<p>Resisting this conclusion, the Government emphasizes the Postal Service's vast operations\u0e42\u0080\u0094the 660 million daily mailings and 142 million delivery points mentioned at the outset. See Brief for Respondents 36. As delivery to mailboxes and doorsteps is essential to this nationwide undertaking, Congress must have intended, the Government asserts, to insulate delivery-related torts from liability. If, however, doorstep delivery is essential to the postal enterprise, then driving postal trucks is no less so. And in any event, while it is true \"[t]he \u0e07 2680 exceptions are designed to protect certain important governmental functions and prerogatives from disruption,\" <i>Molzof</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112676\"><a href=\"/opinion/112676/molzof-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span>, 311 (1992), the specificity of \u0e07 2680(b), see <i>Kosak, supra,</i> at 855, indicates that Congress did not intend to immunize all postal activities.</p>\n<p>Other FTCA exceptions paint with a far broader brush. They cover, for example: \"[a]ny claim for damages caused by the fiscal operations of the Treasury or by the regulation of the monetary system,\" 28 U.S.C. \u0e07 2680(i); \"[a]ny claim arising out of the combatant activities of the military or naval forces, or the Coast Guard, during time of war,\" \u0e07 2680(j); \"[a]ny claim arising in a foreign country,\" \u0e07 2680(k); \"[a]ny <span class=\"star-pagination\">*490</span> claim arising from the activities of the Tennessee Valley Authority,\" \u0e07 2680(<i>l</i>), or \"the Panama Canal Company,\" \u0e07 2680(m); and \"[a]ny claim arising from the activities of a Federal land bank, a Federal intermediate credit bank, or a bank for cooperatives,\" \u0e07 2680(n). Had Congress intended to preserve immunity for all torts related to postal delivery\u0e42\u0080\u0094 torts including hazardous mail placement at customer homes\u0e42\u0080\u0094it could have used similarly sweeping language in \u0e07 2680(b). By instead \"carefully delineat[ing]\" just three types of harm (loss, miscarriage, and negligent transmission), see <i>Kosak,</i> 465 U.S., at 855, Congress expressed the intent to immunize only a subset of postal wrongdoing, not all torts committed in the course of mail delivery.</p>\n<p>Further supporting our interpretation, losses of the type for which immunity is retained under \u0e07 2680(b) are at least to some degree avoidable or compensable through postal registration and insurance. See United States Postal Service, Mailing Standards, Domestic Mail Manual 609.1.1 (Nov. 10, 2005), available at http://pe.usps.gov/text/dmm300/ 609.htm (as visited Jan. 9, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court's case file) (allowing indemnity claims for loss or damage of \"insured, collect on delivery (COD), registered with postal insurance, or Express Mail\"); 39 CFR \u0e07 111.1 (2005) (incorporating by reference the Domestic Mail Manual). The same was true when Congress enacted the FTCA in 1946. See 39 U.S.C. \u0e07 245 (1940 ed. and Supp. V) (setting rates and conditions for mail insurance); \u0e07 381 (1946 ed.) (\"For the greater security of valuable mail matter the Postmaster General may establish a uniform system of registration, and as a part of such system he may provide rules under which the senders or owners of any registered matter shall be indemnified for loss, rifling, or damage thereof in the mails . . .\"). As <i>Kosak</i> explains, one purpose of the FTCA exceptions was to avoid \"extending the coverage of the Act to suits for which adequate remedies were already available,\" 465 U.S., at 858\u0e42\u0080\u0094an objective consistent with retaining <span class=\"star-pagination\">*491</span> immunity as to claims of mail damage or delay covered by postal registration and insurance. While the Government suggests other injuries falling outside the FTCA are also subject to administrative relief, even assuming that is true, the provision the Government cites permits only discretionary relief, not an automatic remedy like postal insurance. See 39 U.S.C. \u0e07 2603 (indicating the Postal Service \"may adjust and settle\" personal-injury and property-damage claims \"not cognizable\" under the FTCA's administrative relief provision); see also 31 U.S.C. \u0e07 224c (1940 ed.) (indicating that \"[w]hen any damage is done to person or property by or through the operation of the Post Office Department. . . the Postmaster General is invested with power to adjust and settle any claim for such damage when his award for such damage in any case does not exceed $500\"); Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, \u0e07 424(a), 60 Stat. 846-847 (repealing \u0e07 224c as to negligence claims cognizable under the FTCA).</p>\n<p>The Government raises the specter of frivolous slip-andfall claims inundating the Postal Service. It is true that, in addition to other considerations we have identified, <i>Kosak</i> describes \"avoiding exposure of the United States to liability for excessive or fraudulent claims\" as a principal aim of the FTCA exceptions, 465 U.S., at 858. Slip-and-fall liability, however, to the extent state tort law imposes it, is a risk shared by any business that makes home deliveries. Given that \"negligent transmission,\" viewed in context and in light of <i>Kosak,</i> cannot sweep as broadly as the Government claims, ordinary protections against frivolous litigation must suffice here, just as they do in the case of motor vehicle collisions.</p>\n<p>Finally, it should be noted that this case does not implicate the general rule that \"a waiver of the Government's sovereign immunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign,\" <i>Lane</i> v. <i>Pen\u0e51a,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118049\"><a href=\"/opinion/118049/lane-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span>, 192 (1996). As <i>Kosak</i> explains, this principle is \"unhelpful\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*492</span> in the FTCA context, where \"unduly generous interpretations of the exceptions run the risk of defeating the central purpose of the statute,\" 465 U.S., at 853, n. 9, which \"waives the Government's immunity from suit in sweeping language,\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Yellow Cab Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104863\"><a href=\"/opinion/104863/united-states-v-yellow-cab-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></a></span>, 547 (1951); see also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Nordic Village, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112694\"><a href=\"/opinion/112694/united-states-v-nordic-village-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 34 (1992) (observing \"[w]e have on occasion narrowly construed exceptions to waivers of sovereign immunity where that was consistent with Congress' clear intent, as in the context of the `sweeping language' of the [FTCA]\" (quoting <i>Yellow Cab Co., supra,</i> at 547)). Hence, \"the proper objective of a court attempting to construe one of the subsections of 28 U.S.C. \u0e07 2680 is to identify `those circumstances which are within the words and reason of the exception'\u0e42\u0080\u0094no less and no more.\" <i>Kosak, supra,</i> at 853, n. 9 (quoting <i>Dalehite</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105142\"><a href=\"/opinion/105142/dalehite-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 31 (1953)). Having made that inquiry here, we conclude Dolan's claims fall outside \u0e07 2680(b).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The postal exception is inapplicable, and Dolan's claim falls within the FTCA's general waiver of federal sovereign immunity. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) waives the Government's sovereign immunity for civil suits seeking money damages</p>\n<blockquote>\"for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*493</span> within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred,\" 28 U.S.C. \u0e07 1346(b)(1),</blockquote>\n<p>save several exceptions found in \u0e07 2680. As relevant here, Congress reserved to the Government its sovereign immunity respecting \"[a]ny claim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter.\" \u0e07 2680(b) (postal exception).</p>\n<p>Petitioner Barbara Dolan claims to have suffered personal injuries when she tripped over letters, packages, and periodicals that an employee of the United States Postal Service (Postal Service) negligently left on her porch. Today, the Court concludes that Dolan's lawsuit may proceed because her claim does not fall within the exception. I disagree. Dolan's claim arises out of the Postal Service's \"negligent transmission\" of mail and is thus covered by the terms of the postal exception. Even if the exception is ambiguous, this Court's cases require that ambiguities as to the scope of the Government's waiver of immunity be resolved in its favor. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The text of the postal exception, and every term therein, should be ascribed its ordinary meaning. See <i>FDIC</i> v. <i>Meyer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112931\"><a href=\"/opinion/112931/fdic-v-meyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span>, 477 (1994) (noting that we interpret a statutory term in accordance with its ordinary meaning when that term is not defined in the statute). The term in controversy here is \"negligent transmission.\" The crux of my disagreement with the majority is its failure to assign the term \"transmission\" its plain meaning. That term is defined as the \"[a]ct, operation, or process, of transmitting.\" Webster's New International Dictionary 2692 (2d ed. 1934, as republished 1945). \"Transmit\" is defined as, <i>inter alia,</i> \"[t]o send or transfer from one person or place to another; to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*494</span> forward by rail, post, wire, etc., . . . [t]o cause . . . to pass or be conveyed.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 2692-2693. There is no cause to conclude that Congress was unaware of the ordinary definition of the terms \"transmission\" and \"transmit\" when it enacted the FTCA and the postal exception in 1946. Nor is there textual indication that Congress intended to deviate from the ordinary meaning of these terms.<sup>[1]</sup> Accordingly, I would interpret the term \"transmission\" consistent with its ordinary meaning, see <i>ante,</i> at 486, and conclude that the postal exception exempts the Government from liability for <i>any</i> claim arising out of the negligent delivery of the mail to a Postal Service patron, including Dolan's slip-and-fall claim.</p>\n<p>Rejecting the \"ordinary meaning and usage\" of \"negligent transmission,\" the majority concludes that the term covers only injury arising \"directly or consequentially\" from \"negligence causing mail to be lost or to arrive late, in damaged condition, or at the wrong address.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 486, 489. Thus, in the majority's view, \"negligent transmission\" covers direct injury to the mail as well as personal injury arising from injury to the mail, but does not cover personal injury that does not arise from damage to the mail. For example, in the majority's view, if a mail carrier negligently drops a box containing glassware on a patron's doorstep, causing the contents to shatter, and the patron later injures himself while attempting to handle the shards of glass, the postal exception would bar a claim for damages for the destroyed item as well as a related claim for personal injury. That <span class=\"star-pagination\">*495</span> view is correct, as far as it goes. However, under the majority's view, if the mail carrier negligently places a heap of mail on a patron's front porch and the patron trips and falls over the mail as he walks out of his front door, his personal injury claim may go forward. There is no basis in the text for the line drawn by the majority. Indeed, the majority's view is at odds with the broad language of the postal exception, which expressly applies to <i>\"[a]ny claim</i> arising out of . . . negligent transmission of letters or postal matter.\" \u0e07 2680(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The majority rationalizes its view by concluding that the terms \"loss\" and \"miscarriage\" necessarily limit the term \"transmission.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 486. Applying the rule of <i>noscitur a sociis</i>\u0e42\u0080\u0094that a word is known by the company it keeps\u0e42\u0080\u0094 the majority reasons that because both \"loss\" and \"miscarriage\" refer to \"failings in the postal obligation to deliver mail in a timely manner to the right address, it would be odd if `negligent transmission' swept far more broadly.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 487. But there is nothing \"odd\" about interpreting the term \"negligent transmission\" to encompass more ground than the decidedly narrower terms \"loss\" and \"miscarriage.\"</p>\n<p>The rule of <i>noscitur a sociis</i> is intended to prevent ascribing to one word a meaning so expansive that it conflicts with other terms of the provision in a manner that gives \"`unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.'\" <i>Gustafson</i> v. <i>Alloyd Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117902\"><a href=\"/opinion/117902/gustafson-v-alloyd-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span>, 575 (1995) (quoting <i>Jarecki</i> v. <i>G. D. Searle &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106270\"><a href=\"/opinion/106270/jarecki-v-gd-searle-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span>, 307 (1961)). That rule, however, \"does not require [the Court] to construe every term in a series narrowly because of the meaning given to just one of the terms,\" where, as here, nothing in the text demands a more limited construction. <i>Gustafson, supra,</i> at 586 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (emphasis deleted). Indeed, to read Congress' use of narrow terms in a list as limiting the meaning of broad terms in the same list \"would defy common sense; doing so would prevent Congress from giving effect to expansive words in a list whenever they are combined <span class=\"star-pagination\">*496</span> with one word with a more restricted meaning.\" 513 U.S., at 587.</p>\n<p>Nor does this Court's opinion in <i>Kosak</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111121\"><a href=\"/opinion/111121/kosak-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></a></span> (1984), support the majority's narrow construction of the postal exception. In <i>Kosak,</i> this Court suggested that the postal exception does not apply to suits arising from the negligent handling of motor vehicles by Postal Service employees. Specifically, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"One of the principal purposes of the [FTCA] was to waive the Government's immunity from liability for injuries resulting from <i>auto accidents</i>.... In order to ensure that \u0e07 2680(b) ... did not have the effect of barring precisely the sort of suit that Congress was most concerned to authorize, the draftsmen of the provision carefully delineated the types of misconduct for which the Government was not assuming financial responsibility\u0e42\u0080\u0094namely, `the loss, miscarriage, <i>or</i> negligent transmission of letters or postal matter' . . . .\" <i>Id.,</i> at 855 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>That observation has no import beyond the recognition that the postal exception\u0e42\u0080\u0094whatever its scope may be\u0e42\u0080\u0094was carefully crafted so as not to undermine an undisputed principal purpose of the FTCA\u0e42\u0080\u0094to waive the Government's immunity for injuries arising from <i>auto accidents.</i> It says nothing further about the acts Congress intended to capture when enacting the postal exception, and, thus, is unremarkable for purposes of construing the exception.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*497</span> Even if <i>Kosak</i> does inform the outcome in this case, it does not support the majority's interpretation of \"negligent transmission.\" As discussed above, the majority does not purport to limit the type of negligent <i>act</i> that may fall under the postal exception; rather it limits the scope of the exception based on the type of <i>consequence</i> that the negligent act causes (damage to the mail, late delivery, etc.). But <i>Kosak</i>'s exclusion of the <i>act</i> of negligent driving\u0e42\u0080\u0094regardless of whether the <i>consequence</i> of that act is damage to the mail or injury to a person\u0e42\u0080\u0094from the scope of the postal exception implies, if anything, that the <i>Kosak</i> Court envisioned discrete <i>acts</i> as being covered, independently of the nature of their consequences. See <i>ibid.</i> (excluding \"negligent handling of motor vehicles\" from the \"types of misconduct\" for which liability is barred by the postal exception). As such, <i>Kosak</i> does not support an interpretation of \"negligent transmission\" based upon the type of injury that is caused by the Postal Service's negligent handling of the mail.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Assuming that the postal exception is ambiguous, as the majority suggests, see <i>ante,</i> at 486-487, settled principles <span class=\"star-pagination\">*498</span> governing the interpretation of waivers of sovereign immunity require us to rule in favor of the Government.</p>\n<p>A court may only exercise jurisdiction over the Government pursuant to \"a clear statement from the United States waiving sovereign immunity . . . together with a claim falling within the terms of the waiver.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>White Mountain Apache Tribe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122263\"><a href=\"/opinion/122263/united-states-v-white-mountain-apache-tribe/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></a></span>, 472 (2003). \"[A] waiver of the Government's sovereign immunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.\" <i>Lane</i> v. <i>Pen\u0e51a,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118049\"><a href=\"/opinion/118049/lane-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span>, 192 (1996). These settled legal principles apply not only to the interpretation of the scope of the Government's waiver of immunity, but also to the interpretation of the scope of any exceptions to that waiver. See <i>ibid.</i> (explaining that, consistent with rules of construction respecting waivers of sovereign immunity, ambiguities created by conditions on and qualifications of the waiver must be strictly construed in favor of sovereign immunity).</p>\n<p>Thus, the majority is incorrect to conclude that \"this case does not implicate the general rule that `a waiver of the Government's sovereign immunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 491. As this case clearly illustrates, the Government's amenability to suit can only be ascertained after construing both the waiver of immunity and its exceptions. The well-established rationale for construing a waiver in favor of the sovereign's immunity, thus, applies with equal force to the construction of an exception to that waiver. Accordingly, even if I were to conclude that the majority's interpretation of \"negligent transmission\" were as plausible as my own, I would still resolve this case in favor of the Government's sovereign immunity as mandated by our canons of construction.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*499</span> * * *</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, I would hold that a tort claim for personal injury arising out of negligent delivery of mail to a postal patron is barred by 28 U.S.C. \u0e07 2680(b), the postal exception. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  <i>Harold Krent, Daniel J. Popeo,</i> and <i>Paul D. Kamenar</i> filed a brief for the Washington Legal Foundation et al. as <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal.</p>\n<p>[1]  In fact, this reading is supported by Congress' routine definitional use of the terms \"transmission\" and \"transmit\" in both criminal and civil postal statutes to refer to the handling, processing, and delivery of mail to a final destination. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Act of Mar. 3, 1845, ch. 43, \u0e07 6, 5 Stat. 734 (respecting deputy postmasters authorized \"to transmit to any person or place\" official letters or packages free of charge); 18 U.S.C. \u0e07\u0e07 1696(b) and (c) (referring to unlawful \"transmission\" of letters); \u0e07\u0e07 1716(b), (c), (d), and (e) (regulating and proscribing \"transmission in the mails\" of dangerous items (<i>e. g.,</i> medicines) except when the \"transmission\" is \"to,\" \"from,\" or \"between\" specified individuals or entities).</p>\n<p>[2]  In an attempt to reconcile <i>Kosak</i> with this case, the majority argues that \"one purpose of the FTCA exceptions was to avoid `extending the coverage of the Act to suits for which adequate remedies were already available,'... an objective consistent with retaining immunity as to [some] claims of mail damage or delay covered by postal registration and insurance.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 490-491 (quoting <i>Kosak,</i> 465 U.S., at 858). The majority, however, ignores the fact that, in most cases, such insurance covers only the sender, not the recipient, in which case recipients have no means of obtaining compensation for loss or damage to money, gifts, heirlooms, valuable papers, delayed medicine, or time-sensitive documents. See United States Postal Service, Mailing Standards, Domestic Mail Manual 609.4.3(f) and (ae), pp. 1129, 1130 (rev. Jan. 6, 2005). The majority's justification also fails to take into account the fact that postal patrons cannot insure against the loss of items of sentimental value. See 609.4.3, generally. With a more accurate depiction of registration and insurance coverage in hand, the Government's claim that, like injuries arising from negligent transmission of mail, other injuries outside the reach of the FTCA are also amenable to administrative relief is not so easily dismissed. <i>Ante,</i> at 491. Specifically, 39 U.S.C. \u0e07 2603, as the Government argues, provides for the settlement of claims, within the discretion of the United States, for injuries caused by the Postal Service that are not otherwise cognizable, which would include claims like Dolan's. The discretionary nature of such settlements does not alter the fact that \u0e07 2603 undermines the Court's position that the purported unavailability of administrative recovery for claims such as Dolan's supports its proposed interpretation.</p>\n<p>[3]  There is no canon of construction that counsels in favor of construing the ambiguity against the Government. Although we have \"on occasion narrowly construed exceptions to waivers of sovereign immunity,\" we have done so in cases where Congress plainly waived the Government's immunity for the particular claim at issue, and the only question before the Court was the permissibility of the form of the suit. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Nordic Village, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112694\"><a href=\"/opinion/112694/united-states-v-nordic-village-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 34 (1992) (citing <i>United States</i> v. <i>Yellow Cab Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104863\"><a href=\"/opinion/104863/united-states-v-yellow-cab-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></a></span> (1951), and <i>United States</i> v. <i>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104734\"><a href=\"/opinion/104734/united-states-v-yellow-cab-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></a></span> (1949)). In cases where, as here, the question whether a particular claim is subject to an exception is disputed, we have construed FTCA exceptions broadly to preclude claims for actions Congress intended to except from the FTCA's general waiver of immunity.
