In this case, the District Court dismissed the plaintiffs' suit on the ground that they were in privity with a state-court loser. We hold that the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine does not bar the plaintiffs from proceeding, and vacate the District Court's judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>This is the latest of several rounds of litigation involving the State of Colorado's congressional redistricting after the 2000 census, under which the State gained a seat in the House of Representatives. <i>Lance</i> v. <i>Davidson,</i> 379 F. Supp. 2d 1117, 1121 (2005). The first round began in May 2001. When the Colorado General Assembly failed to pass a redistricting plan for the 2002 congressional elections by the close of its regular session, a group of Colorado voters asked the state courts to create a plan. The courts agreed, drawing a new map reflecting the additional district. See <i>Beauprez</i> v. <i>Avalos,</i> 42 P.3d 642 (Colo. 2002) (en banc). The 2002 elections were held using this court-ordered plan.</p>\n<p>The General Assembly passed its own redistricting plan in the spring of 2003, prompting further litigation\u0097this time about which electoral map was to govern, the legislature's or the courts'. Two suits were filed seeking to enjoin the legislature's plan: an original action in the Colorado Supreme Court by the state attorney general seeking to require the secretary of state to use the court-ordered plan, and a similar action brought in a lower state court by several proponents of the court-ordered plan. 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1121. After the Colorado General Assembly intervened to defend its plan in the first case, the Colorado Supreme Court held that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*461</span> plan violated Article V, \u00a7 44, of the State Constitution, which the court construed to limit congressional redistricting to \"once per decade.\" <i>People ex rel. Salazar</i> v. <i>Davidson,</i> 79 P. 3d 1221, 1231 (2003) (en banc). It therefore ordered the secretary of state to use the court-created plan. We denied certiorari. 541 U.S. 1093 (2004).</p>\n<p>The second suit was removed to federal court by the defendants on the basis of the plaintiffs' federal-law claims. See <i>Keller</i> v. <i>Davidson,</i> 299 F. Supp. 2d 1171, 1175 (Colo. 2004). Once <i>Salazar</i> was decided by the Colorado Supreme Court, the viability of the defendants' counterclaims was the only remaining issue. A three-judge District Court held that the defendants were barred by the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine from amending their counterclaims to assert additional challenges to the decision in <i>Salazar.</i> It also held that the defendants' original counterclaims, while not barred by the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine, were precluded under Colorado law by the judgment in <i>Salazar.</i> Accordingly, the court dismissed the case.</p>\n<p>Finally, this suit: Before the dismissal in <i>Keller,</i> several Colorado citizens unhappy with <i>Salazar</i> filed an action in the District Court seeking to require the secretary of state to use the legislature's plan.<sup>[1]</sup> The plaintiffs argued that Article V, \u00a7 44, of the Colorado Constitution, as interpreted by the Colorado Supreme Court, violated the Elections Clause of Article I, \u00a7 4, of the U.S. Constitution (\"The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof\"), and the First Amendment's Petition Clause (\"Congress shall make no law ... abridging ... the right of the people . . . to petition the Government for a redress of grievances\"). The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*462</span> that the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine and Colorado preclusion law barred any attack on the Colorado Supreme Court's judgment in <i>Salazar</i> and that the plaintiffs had failed to state a valid Petition Clause claim.</p>\n<p>The three-judge District Court ruled that under the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine, it had no jurisdiction to hear the Elections Clause claim. 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1127. The <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine, the court explained, includes three requirements: (1) \"[T]he party against whom the doctrine is invoked must have actually been a party to the prior state-court judgment or have been in privity with such a party\"; (2) \"the claim raised in the federal suit must have been actually raised or inextricably intertwined with the state-court judgment\"; and (3) \"the federal claim must not be parallel to the state-court claim.\" 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1124. The District Court found the first requirement satisfied on the ground that the citizen-plaintiffs were in privity with the Colorado General Assembly\u0097a losing party in <i>Salazar.</i> Relying on our decisions in <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn.,</i> 443 U.S. 658 (1979), and <i>Tacoma</i> v. <i>Taxpayers of Tacoma,</i> 357 U.S. 320 (1958), the court stated that \"when a state government litigates a matter of public concern, that state's citizens will be deemed to be in privity with the government for preclusion purposes.\" 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1125. This principle, the court reasoned, applies \"with equal force in the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> context.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The court went on to conclude that the Elections Clause claim was actually raised in <i>Salazar,</i> or inextricably intertwined with that decision, and was not parallel to the claims presented in <i>Salazar.</i> As to the Petition Clause claim, the court ruled that neither <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> nor Colorado preclusion law prevented the court from proceeding to the merits, but that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim. 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1132; see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs appealed. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253. We now note jurisdiction, and address whether the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*463</span> doctrine bars the plaintiffs from proceeding because they were in privity with a party in <i>Salazar.</i> We conclude it does not, and vacate the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>This Court is vested, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257, with jurisdiction over appeals from final state-court judgments. We have held that this grant of jurisdiction is exclusive: \"Review of such judgments may be had <i>only</i> in this Court.\" <i>District of Columbia Court of Appeals</i> v. <i>Feldman,</i> 460 U.S. 462, 482 (1983) (emphasis added); see also <i>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co.</i> v. <i>Locomotive Engineers,</i> 398 U.S. 281, 286 (1970); <i>Rooker</i> v. <i>Fidelity Trust Co.,</i> 263 U.S. 413, 416 (1923). Accordingly, under what has come to be known as the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine, lower federal courts are precluded from exercising appellate jurisdiction over final state-court judgments.</p>\n<p>The <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine takes its name from the only two cases in which we have applied this rule to find that a Federal District Court lacked jurisdiction. In <i>Rooker,</i> a party who had lost in the Indiana Supreme Court, and failed to obtain review in this Court, filed an action in Federal District Court challenging the constitutionality of the state-court judgment. We viewed the action as tantamount to an appeal of the Indiana Supreme Court decision, over which only this Court had jurisdiction, and said that the \"aggrieved litigant cannot be permitted to do indirectly what he no longer can do directly.\" 263 U.S., at 416. <i>Feldman,</i> decided 60 years later, concerned slightly different circumstances, with similar results. The plaintiffs there had been refused admission to the District of Columbia bar by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, and sought review of these decisions in Federal District Court. Our decision held that to the extent plaintiffs challenged the Court of Appeals decisions themselves\u0097as opposed to the bar admission rules promulgated nonjudicially by the Court of Appeals\u0097their sole avenue of review was with this Court. 460 U.S., at 476.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*464</span> Neither <i>Rooker</i> nor <i>Feldman</i> elaborated a rationale for a wide-reaching bar on the jurisdiction of lower federal courts, and our cases since <i>Feldman</i> have tended to emphasize the narrowness of the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> rule. See <i>Exxon Mobil,</i> 544 U.S., at 292 (<i>Rooker-Feldman</i> does not apply to parallel state and federal litigation); <i>Verizon Md. Inc.</i> v. <i>Public Serv. Comm'n of Md.,</i> 535 U.S. 635, 644, n. 3 (2002) (<i>Rooker-Feldman</i> \"has no application to judicial review of executive action, including determinations made by a state administrative agency\"); <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>De Grandy,</i> 512 U.S. 997, 1005-1006 (1994) (<i>Rooker-Feldman</i> does not bar actions by a nonparty to the earlier state suit). Indeed, during that period, \"this Court has never applied <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> to dismiss an action for want of jurisdiction.\" <i>Exxon Mobil, supra,</i> at 287.</p>\n<p>In <i>Exxon Mobil,</i> decided last Term, we warned that the lower courts have at times extended <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> \"far beyond the contours of the <i>Rooker</i> and <i>Feldman</i> cases, overriding Congress' conferral of federal-court jurisdiction concurrent with jurisdiction exercised by state courts, and superseding the ordinary application of preclusion law pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738.\" 544 U.S., at 283. <i>Rooker-Feldman,</i> we explained, is a narrow doctrine, confined to \"cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\" 544 U.S., at 284.</p>\n<p>Although we have never addressed the precise question before us, we have held <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> inapplicable where the party against whom the doctrine is invoked was not a party to the underlying state-court proceeding. See <i>De Grandy, supra,</i> at 1006. In <i>De Grandy,</i> the State of Florida sought, using <i>Rooker-Feldman,</i> to prevent the United States from bringing a challenge under \u00a7 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the reapportionment of state electoral districts. The Florida Supreme Court, in an action initiated by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*465</span> state attorney general, had already declared the law valid under state and federal law. We held that <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> did not bar the United States from bringing its own action in federal court because the United States \"was not a party in the state court,\" and \"was in no position to ask this Court to review the state court's judgment and has not directly attacked it in this proceeding.\" 512 U.S., at 1006.</p>\n<p>In the case before us, the plaintiffs were plainly not parties to the underlying state-court proceeding in <i>Salazar. Salazar</i> was an action brought by the state attorney general against the secretary of state, in which the Colorado General Assembly intervened. 79 P.3d, at 1227. The four citizen-plaintiffs here did not participate in <i>Salazar,</i> and were not in a \"position to ask this Court to review the state court's judgment.\" <i>De Grandy, supra,</i> at 1006; see <i>Karcher</i> v. <i>May,</i> 484 U.S. 72, 77 (1987) (\"[T]he general rule [is] that one who is not a party or has not been treated as a party to a judgment has no right to appeal therefrom\").</p>\n<p>Although the District Court recognized the \"general rule\" that <i>\"Rooker-Feldman</i> may not be invoked against a federal-court plaintiff who was not actually a party to the prior state-court judgment,\" 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1123, it nevertheless followed Tenth Circuit precedent in allowing application of <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> against parties who were in privity with a party to the earlier state-court action, 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1123 (citing <i>Kenmen Eng.</i> v. <i>Union,</i> 314 F.3d 468, 481 (2002)). In determining whether privity existed, the court looked to cases concerning the preclusive effect that state courts are required to give federal-court judgments. 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1125 (citing <i>Washington,</i> 443 U.S., at 693, n. 32; <i>Taxpayers of Tacoma,</i> 357 U.S., at 340-341). It concluded that\u0097for <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> as well as preclusion purposes\u0097\"the outcome of the government's litigation over a matter of public concern binds its citizens.\" 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1125.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*466</span> The District Court erroneously conflated preclusion law with <i>Rooker-Feldman.</i> Whatever the impact of privity principles on preclusion rules, <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> is not simply preclusion by another name. The doctrine applies only in \"limited circumstances,\" <i>Exxon Mobil, supra,</i> at 291, where a party in effect seeks to take an appeal of an unfavorable state-court decision to a lower federal court. The <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine does not bar actions by nonparties to the earlier state-court judgment simply because, for purposes of preclusion law, they could be considered in privity with a party to the judgment.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>A more expansive <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> rule would tend to supplant Congress' mandate, under the Full Faith and Credit Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738, that federal courts \"`give the same preclusive effect to state court judgments that those judgments would be given in the courts of the State from which the judgments emerged.'\" <i>Baker</i> v. <i>General Motors Corp.,</i> 522 U.S. 222, 246 (1998) (quoting <i>Kremer</i> v. <i>Chemical Constr. Corp.,</i> 456 U.S. 461, 466 (1982)); see <i>Exxon Mobil, supra,</i> at 293. Congress has directed federal courts to look principally to <i>state</i> law in deciding what effect to give state-court judgments. Incorporation of preclusion principles into <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> risks turning that limited doctrine into a uniform <i>federal</i> rule governing the preclusive effect of state-court judgments, contrary to the Full Faith and Credit Act.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*467</span> * * *</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the District Court is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER joins, concurring.</p>\n<p>I agree in full with the Court's correction of the District Court's <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> error, and therefore join the Court's opinion. Although JUSTICE STEVENS has persuasively urged that issue preclusion warrants affirmance, see <i>post,</i> at 468-469 (dissenting opinion), that question of Colorado law seems to me best left for full airing and decision on remand.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.</p>\n<p><i>Rooker</i> and <i>Feldman</i> are strange bedfellows. <i>Rooker,</i> a unanimous, three-page opinion written by Justice Van Devanter in 1923, correctly applied the simple legal proposition that only this Court may exercise appellate jurisdiction over state-court judgments. See <i>Rooker</i> v. <i>Fidelity Trust Co.,</i> 263 U.S. 413, 416. <i>Feldman,</i> a nonunanimous, 25-page opinion written by Justice Brennan in 1983, was incorrectly decided and generated a plethora of confusion and debate among scholars and judges.<sup>[*]</sup> See <i>District of Columbia</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*468</span> <i>Court of Appeals</i> v. <i>Feldman,</i> 460 U.S. 462; <i>id.,</i> at 488 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Last Term, in JUSTICE Ginsburg's lucid opinion in <i>Exxon Mobil Corp.</i> v. <i>Saudi Basic Industries Corp.,</i> 544 U.S. 280 (2005), the Court finally interred the so-called <i>\"Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine.\" And today, the Court quite properly disapproves of the District Court's resuscitation of a doctrine that has produced nothing but mischief for 23 years.</p>\n<p>My disagreement with the majority arises not from what it actually decides, but from what it fails to address. Even though the District Court mistakenly believed it had no jurisdiction to hear this matter, its judgment dismissing the cause with prejudice was correct and should be affirmed. See <i>Lance</i> v. <i>Davidson,</i> 379 F. Supp. 2d 1117, 1132 (Colo. 2005). The Elections Clause claim advanced by citizen-appellants in this case is the same as that advanced by their official representatives and decided by the Colorado Supreme Court in <i>People ex rel. Salazar</i> v. <i>Davidson,</i> 79 P. 3d 1221, 1231-1232 (2003). See 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1126. As appellee points out, appellants' second question presented \"is literally the same question presented by the General Assembly on <i>certiorari</i> review (and denied) in <i>Salazar.\"</i> Motion to Affirm 12. And, as a matter of Colorado law, appellants are clearly in privity with both then-Colorado Attorney General Salazar, who brought the suit on behalf of the people of Colorado, and the Colorado General Assembly, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*469</span> which was also a party to the <i>Salazar</i> litigation. See <i>McNichols</i> v. <i>City &amp; County of Denver,</i> 101 Colo. 316, 322, 74 P. 2d 99, 102 (1937) (en banc) (finding privity between taxpayers seeking to challenge the validity of a bond issue and a public official \"charged with ministerial and executive duties in connection\" with the issuance of the bonds who already brought such a suit); <i>Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. R. Co.</i> v. <i>Board of County Comm'rs of County of Fremont,</i> 95 Colo. 435, 441, 37 P. 2d 761, 764 (1934) (en banc) (explaining that taxpayers are in privity with a political division of the State or its official representative if the case involves \"a matter of general interest to all the people\"). Thus, all of the requirements under Colorado law for issue preclusion have been met, and appellants' Elections Clause claim should therefore be dismissed. See generally 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738; <i>Michaelson</i> v. <i>Michaelson,</i> 884 P. 2d 695, 700-701 (Colo. 1994) (en banc) (setting forth requirements for issue preclusion under Colorado law).</p>\n<p>Appellants' spurious Petition Clause claim was also properly dismissed by the District Court. See 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1130-1132. Nothing in the Colorado Constitution prevents appellants from petitioning the Colorado General Assembly with their grievances, <i>id.,</i> at 1131; nothing in the United States Constitution guarantees that such a petition will be effective, <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Highway Employees,</i> 441 U.S. 463, 465 (1979) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>;</i> see also <i>Minnesota State Bd. for Community Colleges</i> v. <i>Knight,</i> 465 U.S. 271, 285 (1984). Moreover, as the District Court recognized, appellants' interpretation of the Petition Clause would lead to absurd results. See 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1131-1132. As such, appellants' Petition Clause claim was correctly dismissed because it fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. See generally Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Although the secretary of state defended the legislature's plan in <i>Salazar,</i> following that decision she agreed to defend the court-ordered plan in this litigation and to allow the state attorney general to represent her. 379 F. Supp. 2d 1117, 1122, n. 3 (Colo. 2005).</p>\n<p>[2]  In holding that <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> does not bar the plaintiffs here from proceeding, we need not address whether there are <i>any</i> circumstances, however limited, in which <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> may be applied against a party not named in an earlier state proceeding\u0097<i>e. g.,</i> where an estate takes a <i>de facto</i> appeal in a district court of an earlier state decision involving the decedent.</p>\n<p>[3]  Our holding also disposes of the claim, which the District Court did not reach, that plaintiffs were barred by <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> because they were in privity with the secretary of state, the other losing party in <i>People ex rel. Salazar</i> v. <i>Davidson,</i> 79 P.3d 1221 (Colo. 2003) (en banc).

Lance v. Davidson, 379\nF. Supp. 2d 1117, 1121 (2005). The first round began in\nMay 2001. When the Colorado General Assembly failed to\npass a redistricting plan for the 2002 congressional elec-\ntions by the close of its regular session, a group of Colo-\nrado voters asked the state courts to create a plan. The\ncourts agreed, drawing a new map reflecting the addi-\ntional district. See Beauprez v. Avalos, 42 P. 3d 642 (Colo.\n2002) (en banc). The 2002 elections were held using this\ncourt-ordered plan.\n   The General Assembly passed its own redistricting plan\nin the spring of 2003, prompting further litigation\u2014this\n2                        LANCE v.

Two suits were filed seeking to enjoin\nthe legislature\u2019s plan: an original action in the Colorado\nSupreme Court by the state attorney general seeking to\nrequire the secretary of state to use the court-ordered\nplan, and a similar action brought in a lower state court\nby several proponents of the court-ordered plan. 379\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1121. After the Colorado General Assem-\nbly intervened to defend its plan in the first case, the\nColorado Supreme Court held that the plan violated Arti-\ncle V, \u00a744, of the State Constitution, which the court con-\nstrued to limit congressional redistricting to \u201conce per\ndecade.\u201d People ex rel. Salazar v. Davidson, 79 P. 3d 1221,\n1231 (2003) (en banc). It therefore ordered the secretary\nof state to use the court-created plan. We denied certio-\nrari. 541 U. S. 1093 (2004).\n   The second suit was removed to federal court by the\ndefendants on the basis of plaintiffs\u2019 federal-law claims.\nSee Keller v. Davidson, 299 F. Supp. 2d 1171, 1175 (Colo.\n2004). Once Salazar was decided by the Colorado Su-\npreme Court, the viability of the defendants\u2019 counter-\nclaims was the only remaining issue. A three-judge Dis-\ntrict Court held that the defendants were barred by the\nRooker-Feldman doctrine from amending their counter-\nclaims to assert additional challenges to the decision in\nSalazar. It also held that the defendants\u2019 original coun-\nterclaims, while not barred by the Rooker-Feldman doc-\ntrine, were precluded under Colorado law by the judgment\nin Salazar. Accordingly, the court dismissed the case.\n   Finally, this suit: Before the dismissal in Keller, several\nColorado citizens unhappy with Salazar filed an action in\nthe District Court seeking to require the secretary of state\nto use the legislature\u2019s plan.1 The plaintiffs argued that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Although the secretary of state defended the legislature\u2019s plan in\n\nSalazar, following that decision she agreed to defend the court-ordered\n                     Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)                    3\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nArticle V, \u00a744, of the Colorado Constitution, as interpreted\nby the Colorado Supreme Court, violated the Elections\nClause of Article I, \u00a74, of the U. S. Constitution (\u201cThe\nTimes, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Sena-\ntors and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State\nby the Legislature thereof\u201d), and the First Amendment\u2019s\nPetition Clause (\u201cCongress shall make no law . . . abridg-\ning . . . the right of the people . . . to petition the Govern-\nment for a redress of grievances\u201d). The defendants filed a\nmotion to dismiss, arguing that the Rooker-Feldman\ndoctrine and Colorado preclusion law barred any attack on\nthe Colorado Supreme Court\u2019s judgment in Salazar and\nthat the plaintiffs had failed to state a valid Petition\nClause claim.\n   The three-judge District Court ruled that under the\nRooker-Feldman doctrine, it had no jurisdiction to hear\nthe Elections Clause claim. 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1127. The\nRooker-Feldman doctrine, the court explained, includes\nthree requirements: (1) \u201cthe party against whom the doc-\ntrine is invoked must have actually been a party to the\nprior state-court judgment or have been in privity with\nsuch a party\u201d; (2) \u201cthe claim raised in the federal suit must\nhave been actually raised or inextricably intertwined with\nthe state-court judgment\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe federal claim must\nnot be parallel to the state-court claim.\u201d 379 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 1124. The District Court found the first requirement\nsatisfied on the ground that the citizen plaintiffs were in\nprivity with the Colorado General Assembly\u2014a losing\nparty in Salazar. Relying on our decisions in Washington\nv. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel\nAssn., 443 U. S. 658 (1979), and Tacoma v. Taxpayers of\nTacoma, 357 U. S. 320 (1958), the court stated that \u201cwhen\na state government litigates a matter of public concern,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nplan in this litigation and to allow the state attorney general to repre\n\n                                                                        -\nsent her. 379 F. Supp. 2d 1117, 1122, n. 3 (Colo. 2005). \n\n4                     LANCE v.

This principle, the court reasoned, applies \u201cwith\nequal force in the Rooker-Feldman context.\u201d Ibid. The\ncourt went on to conclude that the Elections Clause claim\nwas actually raised in Salazar, or inextricably intertwined\nwith that decision, and was not parallel to the claims\npresented in Salazar. As to the Petition Clause claim, the\ncourt ruled that neither Rooker-Feldman nor Colorado\npreclusion law prevented the court from proceeding to the\nmerits, but that plaintiffs failed to state a claim. 379\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1132; see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6).\n   The plaintiffs appealed. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71253. We now\nnote jurisdiction, and address whether the Rooker-\nFeldman doctrine bars the plaintiffs from proceeding\nbecause they were in privity with a party in Salazar. We\nconclude it does not, and vacate the judgment of the Dis-\ntrict Court.\n                               II\n  This Court is vested, under 28 U. S. C. \u00a71257, with\njurisdiction over appeals from final state-court judgments.\nWe have held that this grant of jurisdiction is exclusive:\n\u201cReview of such judgments may be had only in this Court.\u201d\nDistrict of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460\nU. S. 462, 482 (1983) (emphasis added); see also Atlantic\nCoast Line R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers, 398 U. S. 281,\n286 (1970); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413, 416\n(1923). Accordingly, under what has come to be known as\nthe Rooker-Feldman doctrine, lower federal courts are\nprecluded from exercising appellate jurisdiction over final\nstate-court judgments.\n  The Rooker-Feldman doctrine takes its name from the\nonly two cases in which we have applied this rule to find\nthat a federal district court lacked jurisdiction. In Rooker,\na party who had lost in the Indiana Supreme Court, and\n                 Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nfailed to obtain review in this Court, filed an action in\nfederal district court challenging the constitutionality of\nthe state-court judgment. We viewed the action as tanta-\nmount to an appeal of the Indiana Supreme Court deci-\nsion, over which only this Court had jurisdiction, and said\nthat the \u201caggrieved litigant cannot be permitted to do\nindirectly what he no longer can do directly.\u201d 263 U. S., at\n416. Feldman, decided 60 years later, concerned slightly\ndifferent circumstances, with similar results. The plain-\ntiffs there had been refused admission to the District of\nColumbia bar by the District of Columbia Court of Ap-\npeals, and sought review of these decisions in federal\ndistrict court. Our decision held that to the extent plain-\ntiffs challenged the Court of Appeals decisions them-\nselves\u2014as opposed to the bar admission rules promul-\ngated nonjudicially by the Court of Appeals\u2014their sole\navenue of review was with this Court. 460 U. S., at 476.\n   Neither Rooker nor Feldman elaborated a rationale for a\nwide-reaching bar on the jurisdiction of lower federal\ncourts, and our cases since Feldman have tended to em-\nphasize the narrowness of the Rooker-Feldman rule. See\nExxon Mobil, 544 U. S., at 292 (Rooker-Feldman does not\napply to parallel state and federal litigation); Verizon Md.\nInc. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 644, n. 3\n(2002) (Rooker-Feldman \u201chas no application to judicial\nreview of executive action, including determinations made\nby a state administrative agency\u201d); Johnson v. De Grandy,\n512 U. S. 997, 1005\u20131006 (1994) (Rooker-Feldman does\nnot bar actions by a nonparty to the earlier state suit).\nIndeed, during that period, \u201cthis Court has never applied\nRooker-Feldman to dismiss an action for want of jurisdic-\ntion.\u201d Exxon Mobil, supra, at 287.\n   In Exxon Mobil, decided last Term, we warned that the\nlower courts have at times extended Rooker-Feldman \u201cfar\nbeyond the contours of the Rooker and Feldman cases,\noverriding Congress\u2019 conferral of federal-court jurisdiction\n6                     LANCE v. DENNIS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nconcurrent with jurisdiction exercised by state courts, and\nsuperseding the ordinary application of preclusion law\npursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a71738.\u201d 544 U. S., at 283. Rooker-\nFeldman, we explained, is a narrow doctrine, confined to\n\u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of inju-\nries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the\ndistrict court proceedings commenced and inviting district\ncourt review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d 544 U. S.,\nat 284.\n   Although we have never addressed the precise question\nbefore us, we have held Rooker-Feldman inapplicable\nwhere the party against whom the doctrine is invoked was\nnot a party to the underlying state-court proceeding. See\nDe Grandy, supra, at 1006. In De Grandy, the State of\nFlorida sought, using Rooker-Feldman, to prevent the\nUnited States from bringing a challenge under \u00a72 of the\nVoting Rights Act of 1965 to the reapportionment of state\nelectoral districts. The Florida Supreme Court, in an\naction initiated by the state attorney general, had already\ndeclared the law valid under state and federal law. We\nheld that Rooker-Feldman did not bar the United States\nfrom bringing its own action in federal court because the\nUnited States \u201cwas not a party in the state court,\u201d and\n\u201cwas in no position to ask this Court to review the state\ncourt\u2019s judgment and has not directly attacked it in this\nproceeding.\u201d 512 U. S., at 1006.\n   In the case before us, plaintiffs were plainly not parties\nto the underlying state-court proceeding in Salazar.\nSalazar was an action brought by the state attorney gen-\neral against the secretary of state, in which the Colorado\nGeneral Assembly intervened. 79 P. 3d, at 1227. The four\ncitizen-plaintiffs here did not participate in Salazar, and\nwere not in a \u201cposition to ask this Court to review the\nstate court\u2019s judgment.\u201d De Grandy, supra, at 1006; see\nKarcher v. May, 484 U. S. 72, 77 (1987) (\u201c[T]he general rule\n[is] that one who is not a party or has not been treated as a\n                     Cite as: 546 U.

Supp. 2d, at 1123, it\nnevertheless followed Tenth Circuit precedent in allowing\napplication of Rooker-Feldman against parties who were\nin privity with a party to the earlier state-court action.\n379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1123 (citing Kenmen Eng. v. Union,\n314 F. 3d 468, 481 (2002)). In determining whether priv-\nity existed, the court looked to cases concerning the pre-\nclusive effect that state courts are required to give federal-\ncourt judgments. 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1125 (citing Wash-\nington, 443 U. S., at 693, n. 32; Taxpayers of Tacoma, 357\nU. S., at 340\u2013341). It concluded that\u2014for Rooker-Feldman\nas well as preclusion purposes\u2014\u201cthe outcome of the gov-\nernment\u2019s litigation over a matter of public concern binds\nits citizens.\u201d 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1125.\n   The District Court erroneously conflated preclusion law\nwith Rooker-Feldman. Whatever the impact of privity\nprinciples on preclusion rules, Rooker-Feldman is not\nsimply preclusion by another name. The doctrine applies\nonly in \u201climited circumstances,\u201d Exxon Mobil, supra, at\n291, where a party in effect seeks to take an appeal of an\nunfavorable state-court decision to a lower federal court.\nThe Rooker-Feldman doctrine does not bar actions by\nnonparties to the earlier state-court judgment simply\nbecause, for purposes of preclusion law, they could be\nconsidered in privity with a party to the judgment.2\n   A more expansive Rooker-Feldman rule would tend to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 In holding that Rooker-Feldman does not bar plaintiffs here from\n\nproceeding, we need not address whether there are any circumstances,\nhowever limited, in which Rooker-Feldman may be applied against a\nparty not named in an earlier state proceeding\u2014e.g., where an estate\ntakes a de facto appeal in a district court of an earlier state decision\ninvolving the decedent.\n8                         LANCE v.

Congress has directed federal courts\nto look principally to state law in deciding what effect to\ngive state-court judgments. Incorporation of preclusion\nprinciples into Rooker-Feldman risks turning that limited\ndoctrine into a uniform federal rule governing the preclu-\nsive effect of state-court judgments, contrary to the Full\nFaith and Credit Act.3\n                      *    *    *\n  The judgment of the District Court is vacated, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                         It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Our holding also disposes of the claim, which the District Court did\n\nnot reach, that plaintiffs were barred by Rooker-Feldman because they\nwere in privity with the secretary of state, the other losing party in\nPeople ex rel.

See Lance v. Davidson, 379 F. Supp. 2d 1117,\n1132 (Colo. 2005).

We hold that the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine does not bar the plaintiffs from proceeding, and vacate the District Court's judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>This is the latest of several rounds of litigation involving the State of Colorado's congressional redistricting after the 2000 census, under which the State gained a seat in the House of Representatives. <i>Lance</i> v. <i>Davidson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2416820\"><a href=\"/opinion/2416820/lance-v-davidson/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1117</span></a></span>, 1121 (2005). The first round began in May 2001. When the Colorado General Assembly failed to pass a redistricting plan for the 2002 congressional elections by the close of its regular session, a group of Colorado voters asked the state courts to create a plan. The courts agreed, drawing a new map reflecting the additional district. See <i>Beauprez</i> v. <i>Avalos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2639372\"><a href=\"/opinion/2639372/beauprez-v-avalos/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span> (Colo. 2002) (en banc). The 2002 elections were held using this court-ordered plan.</p>\n<p>The General Assembly passed its own redistricting plan in the spring of 2003, prompting further litigation\u0097this time about which electoral map was to govern, the legislature's or the courts'. Two suits were filed seeking to enjoin the legislature's plan: an original action in the Colorado Supreme Court by the state attorney general seeking to require the secretary of state to use the court-ordered plan, and a similar action brought in a lower state court by several proponents of the court-ordered plan. 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1121. After the Colorado General Assembly intervened to defend its plan in the first case, the Colorado Supreme Court held that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*461</span> plan violated Article V, \u00a7 44, of the State Constitution, which the court construed to limit congressional redistricting to \"once per decade.\" <i>People ex rel. Salazar</i> v. <i>Davidson,</i> 79 P. 3d 1221, 1231 (2003) (en banc). It therefore ordered the secretary of state to use the court-created plan. We denied certiorari. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1093</span></span> (2004).</p>\n<p>The second suit was removed to federal court by the defendants on the basis of the plaintiffs' federal-law claims. See <i>Keller</i> v. <i>Davidson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1171</span></span>, 1175 (Colo. 2004). Once <i>Salazar</i> was decided by the Colorado Supreme Court, the viability of the defendants' counterclaims was the only remaining issue. A three-judge District Court held that the defendants were barred by the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine from amending their counterclaims to assert additional challenges to the decision in <i>Salazar.</i> It also held that the defendants' original counterclaims, while not barred by the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine, were precluded under Colorado law by the judgment in <i>Salazar.</i> Accordingly, the court dismissed the case.</p>\n<p>Finally, this suit: Before the dismissal in <i>Keller,</i> several Colorado citizens unhappy with <i>Salazar</i> filed an action in the District Court seeking to require the secretary of state to use the legislature's plan.<sup>[1]</sup> The plaintiffs argued that Article V, \u00a7 44, of the Colorado Constitution, as interpreted by the Colorado Supreme Court, violated the Elections Clause of Article I, \u00a7 4, of the U.S. Constitution (\"The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof\"), and the First Amendment's Petition Clause (\"Congress shall make no law ... abridging ... the right of the people . . . to petition the Government for a redress of grievances\"). The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*462</span> that the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine and Colorado preclusion law barred any attack on the Colorado Supreme Court's judgment in <i>Salazar</i> and that the plaintiffs had failed to state a valid Petition Clause claim.</p>\n<p>The three-judge District Court ruled that under the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine, it had no jurisdiction to hear the Elections Clause claim. 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1127. The <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine, the court explained, includes three requirements: (1) \"[T]he party against whom the doctrine is invoked must have actually been a party to the prior state-court judgment or have been in privity with such a party\"; (2) \"the claim raised in the federal suit must have been actually raised or inextricably intertwined with the state-court judgment\"; and (3) \"the federal claim must not be parallel to the state-court claim.\" 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1124. The District Court found the first requirement satisfied on the ground that the citizen-plaintiffs were in privity with the Colorado General Assembly\u0097a losing party in <i>Salazar.</i> Relying on our decisions in <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110146\"><a href=\"/opinion/110146/washington-v-washington-state-commercial-passenger/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span> (1979), and <i>Tacoma</i> v. <i>Taxpayers of Tacoma,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105732\"><a href=\"/opinion/105732/tacoma-v-taxpayers-of-tacoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span> (1958), the court stated that \"when a state government litigates a matter of public concern, that state's citizens will be deemed to be in privity with the government for preclusion purposes.\" 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1125. This principle, the court reasoned, applies \"with equal force in the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> context.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The court went on to conclude that the Elections Clause claim was actually raised in <i>Salazar,</i> or inextricably intertwined with that decision, and was not parallel to the claims presented in <i>Salazar.</i> As to the Petition Clause claim, the court ruled that neither <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> nor Colorado preclusion law prevented the court from proceeding to the merits, but that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim. 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1132; see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs appealed. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253. We now note jurisdiction, and address whether the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*463</span> doctrine bars the plaintiffs from proceeding because they were in privity with a party in <i>Salazar.</i> We conclude it does not, and vacate the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>This Court is vested, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257, with jurisdiction over appeals from final state-court judgments. We have held that this grant of jurisdiction is exclusive: \"Review of such judgments may be had <i>only</i> in this Court.\" <i>District of Columbia Court of Appeals</i> v. <i>Feldman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110889\"><a href=\"/opinion/110889/district-of-columbia-court-of-appeals-v-feldman/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span>, 482 (1983) (emphasis added); see also <i>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co.</i> v. <i>Locomotive Engineers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108160\"><a href=\"/opinion/108160/atlantic-coast-line-r-co-v-locomotive-engineers/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span>, 286 (1970); <i>Rooker</i> v. <i>Fidelity Trust Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100125\"><a href=\"/opinion/100125/rooker-v-fidelity-trust-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span>, 416 (1923). Accordingly, under what has come to be known as the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine, lower federal courts are precluded from exercising appellate jurisdiction over final state-court judgments.</p>\n<p>The <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine takes its name from the only two cases in which we have applied this rule to find that a Federal District Court lacked jurisdiction. In <i>Rooker,</i> a party who had lost in the Indiana Supreme Court, and failed to obtain review in this Court, filed an action in Federal District Court challenging the constitutionality of the state-court judgment. We viewed the action as tantamount to an appeal of the Indiana Supreme Court decision, over which only this Court had jurisdiction, and said that the \"aggrieved litigant cannot be permitted to do indirectly what he no longer can do directly.\" 263 U.S., at 416. <i>Feldman,</i> decided 60 years later, concerned slightly different circumstances, with similar results. The plaintiffs there had been refused admission to the District of Columbia bar by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, and sought review of these decisions in Federal District Court. Our decision held that to the extent plaintiffs challenged the Court of Appeals decisions themselves\u0097as opposed to the bar admission rules promulgated nonjudicially by the Court of Appeals\u0097their sole avenue of review was with this Court. 460 U.S., at 476.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*464</span> Neither <i>Rooker</i> nor <i>Feldman</i> elaborated a rationale for a wide-reaching bar on the jurisdiction of lower federal courts, and our cases since <i>Feldman</i> have tended to emphasize the narrowness of the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> rule. See <i>Exxon Mobil,</i> 544 U.S., at 292 (<i>Rooker-Feldman</i> does not apply to parallel state and federal litigation); <i>Verizon Md. Inc.</i> v. <i>Public Serv. Comm'n of Md.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118506\"><a href=\"/opinion/118506/verizon-maryland-inc-v-public-service-commission-o/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span>, 644, n. 3 (2002) (<i>Rooker-Feldman</i> \"has no application to judicial review of executive action, including determinations made by a state administrative agency\"); <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>De Grandy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117876\"><a href=\"/opinion/117876/johnson-v-de-grandy/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">997</span></a></span>, 1005-1006 (1994) (<i>Rooker-Feldman</i> does not bar actions by a nonparty to the earlier state suit). Indeed, during that period, \"this Court has never applied <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> to dismiss an action for want of jurisdiction.\" <i>Exxon Mobil, supra,</i> at 287.</p>\n<p>In <i>Exxon Mobil,</i> decided last Term, we warned that the lower courts have at times extended <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> \"far beyond the contours of the <i>Rooker</i> and <i>Feldman</i> cases, overriding Congress' conferral of federal-court jurisdiction concurrent with jurisdiction exercised by state courts, and superseding the ordinary application of preclusion law pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738.\" 544 U.S., at 283. <i>Rooker-Feldman,</i> we explained, is a narrow doctrine, confined to \"cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\" 544 U.S., at 284.</p>\n<p>Although we have never addressed the precise question before us, we have held <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> inapplicable where the party against whom the doctrine is invoked was not a party to the underlying state-court proceeding. See <i>De Grandy, supra,</i> at 1006. In <i>De Grandy,</i> the State of Florida sought, using <i>Rooker-Feldman,</i> to prevent the United States from bringing a challenge under \u00a7 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the reapportionment of state electoral districts. The Florida Supreme Court, in an action initiated by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*465</span> state attorney general, had already declared the law valid under state and federal law. We held that <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> did not bar the United States from bringing its own action in federal court because the United States \"was not a party in the state court,\" and \"was in no position to ask this Court to review the state court's judgment and has not directly attacked it in this proceeding.\" 512 U.S., at 1006.</p>\n<p>In the case before us, the plaintiffs were plainly not parties to the underlying state-court proceeding in <i>Salazar. Salazar</i> was an action brought by the state attorney general against the secretary of state, in which the Colorado General Assembly intervened. 79 P.3d, at 1227. The four citizen-plaintiffs here did not participate in <i>Salazar,</i> and were not in a \"position to ask this Court to review the state court's judgment.\" <i>De Grandy, supra,</i> at 1006; see <i>Karcher</i> v. <i>May,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111967\"><a href=\"/opinion/111967/karcher-v-may/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span>, 77 (1987) (\"[T]he general rule [is] that one who is not a party or has not been treated as a party to a judgment has no right to appeal therefrom\").</p>\n<p>Although the District Court recognized the \"general rule\" that <i>\"Rooker-Feldman</i> may not be invoked against a federal-court plaintiff who was not actually a party to the prior state-court judgment,\" 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1123, it nevertheless followed Tenth Circuit precedent in allowing application of <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> against parties who were in privity with a party to the earlier state-court action, 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1123 (citing <i>Kenmen Eng.</i> v. <i>Union,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"162851\"><a href=\"/opinion/162851/kenman-engineering-v-city-of-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">314</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span>, 481 (2002)). In determining whether privity existed, the court looked to cases concerning the preclusive effect that state courts are required to give federal-court judgments. 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1125 (citing <i>Washington,</i> 443 U.S., at 693, n. 32; <i>Taxpayers of Tacoma,</i> 357 U.S., at 340-341). It concluded that\u0097for <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> as well as preclusion purposes\u0097\"the outcome of the government's litigation over a matter of public concern binds its citizens.\" 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1125.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*466</span> The District Court erroneously conflated preclusion law with <i>Rooker-Feldman.</i> Whatever the impact of privity principles on preclusion rules, <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> is not simply preclusion by another name. The doctrine applies only in \"limited circumstances,\" <i>Exxon Mobil, supra,</i> at 291, where a party in effect seeks to take an appeal of an unfavorable state-court decision to a lower federal court. The <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine does not bar actions by nonparties to the earlier state-court judgment simply because, for purposes of preclusion law, they could be considered in privity with a party to the judgment.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>A more expansive <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> rule would tend to supplant Congress' mandate, under the Full Faith and Credit Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738, that federal courts \"`give the same preclusive effect to state court judgments that those judgments would be given in the courts of the State from which the judgments emerged.'\" <i>Baker</i> v. <i>General Motors Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118161\"><a href=\"/opinion/118161/baker-v-general-motors-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span>, 246 (1998) (quoting <i>Kremer</i> v. <i>Chemical Constr. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110706\"><a href=\"/opinion/110706/kremer-v-chemical-constr-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, 466 (1982)); see <i>Exxon Mobil, supra,</i> at 293. Congress has directed federal courts to look principally to <i>state</i> law in deciding what effect to give state-court judgments. Incorporation of preclusion principles into <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> risks turning that limited doctrine into a uniform <i>federal</i> rule governing the preclusive effect of state-court judgments, contrary to the Full Faith and Credit Act.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*467</span> * * *</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the District Court is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER joins, concurring.</p>\n<p>I agree in full with the Court's correction of the District Court's <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> error, and therefore join the Court's opinion. Although JUSTICE STEVENS has persuasively urged that issue preclusion warrants affirmance, see <i>post,</i> at 468-469 (dissenting opinion), that question of Colorado law seems to me best left for full airing and decision on remand.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.</p>\n<p><i>Rooker</i> and <i>Feldman</i> are strange bedfellows. <i>Rooker,</i> a unanimous, three-page opinion written by Justice Van Devanter in 1923, correctly applied the simple legal proposition that only this Court may exercise appellate jurisdiction over state-court judgments. See <i>Rooker</i> v. <i>Fidelity Trust Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100125\"><a href=\"/opinion/100125/rooker-v-fidelity-trust-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span>, 416. <i>Feldman,</i> a nonunanimous, 25-page opinion written by Justice Brennan in 1983, was incorrectly decided and generated a plethora of confusion and debate among scholars and judges.<sup>[*]</sup> See <i>District of Columbia</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*468</span> <i>Court of Appeals</i> v. <i>Feldman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110889\"><a href=\"/opinion/110889/district-of-columbia-court-of-appeals-v-feldman/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span>; <i>id.,</i> at 488 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Last Term, in JUSTICE Ginsburg's lucid opinion in <i>Exxon Mobil Corp.</i> v. <i>Saudi Basic Industries Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142885\"><a href=\"/opinion/142885/exxon-mobil-corp-v-saudi-basic-industries-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span> (2005), the Court finally interred the so-called <i>\"Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine.\" And today, the Court quite properly disapproves of the District Court's resuscitation of a doctrine that has produced nothing but mischief for 23 years.</p>\n<p>My disagreement with the majority arises not from what it actually decides, but from what it fails to address. Even though the District Court mistakenly believed it had no jurisdiction to hear this matter, its judgment dismissing the cause with prejudice was correct and should be affirmed. See <i>Lance</i> v. <i>Davidson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2416820\"><a href=\"/opinion/2416820/lance-v-davidson/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1117</span></a></span>, 1132 (Colo. 2005). The Elections Clause claim advanced by citizen-appellants in this case is the same as that advanced by their official representatives and decided by the Colorado Supreme Court in <i>People ex rel. Salazar</i> v. <i>Davidson,</i> 79 P. 3d 1221, 1231-1232 (2003). See 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1126. As appellee points out, appellants' second question presented \"is literally the same question presented by the General Assembly on <i>certiorari</i> review (and denied) in <i>Salazar.\"</i> Motion to Affirm 12. And, as a matter of Colorado law, appellants are clearly in privity with both then-Colorado Attorney General Salazar, who brought the suit on behalf of the people of Colorado, and the Colorado General Assembly, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*469</span> which was also a party to the <i>Salazar</i> litigation. See <i>McNichols</i> v. <i>City &amp; County of Denver,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Colo.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></span>, 322, 74 P. 2d 99, 102 (1937) (en banc) (finding privity between taxpayers seeking to challenge the validity of a bond issue and a public official \"charged with ministerial and executive duties in connection\" with the issuance of the bonds who already brought such a suit); <i>Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. R. Co.</i> v. <i>Board of County Comm'rs of County of Fremont,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Colo.</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></span>, 441, 37 P. 2d 761, 764 (1934) (en banc) (explaining that taxpayers are in privity with a political division of the State or its official representative if the case involves \"a matter of general interest to all the people\"). Thus, all of the requirements under Colorado law for issue preclusion have been met, and appellants' Elections Clause claim should therefore be dismissed. See generally 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738; <i>Michaelson</i> v. <i>Michaelson,</i> 884 P. 2d 695, 700-701 (Colo. 1994) (en banc) (setting forth requirements for issue preclusion under Colorado law).</p>\n<p>Appellants' spurious Petition Clause claim was also properly dismissed by the District Court. See 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1130-1132. Nothing in the Colorado Constitution prevents appellants from petitioning the Colorado General Assembly with their grievances, <i>id.,</i> at 1131; nothing in the United States Constitution guarantees that such a petition will be effective, <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Highway Employees,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110070\"><a href=\"/opinion/110070/smith-v-highway-employees/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">463</span></a></span>, 465 (1979) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>;</i> see also <i>Minnesota State Bd. for Community Colleges</i> v. <i>Knight,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111100\"><a href=\"/opinion/111100/minnesota-state-bd-for-community-colleges-v-knight/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span>, 285 (1984). Moreover, as the District Court recognized, appellants' interpretation of the Petition Clause would lead to absurd results. See 379 F. Supp. 2d, at 1131-1132. As such, appellants' Petition Clause claim was correctly dismissed because it fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. See generally Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Although the secretary of state defended the legislature's plan in <i>Salazar,</i> following that decision she agreed to defend the court-ordered plan in this litigation and to allow the state attorney general to represent her. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2416820\"><a href=\"/opinion/2416820/lance-v-davidson/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.
