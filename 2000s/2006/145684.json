The Government concedes that this practice is a sincere exercise of religion, but nonetheless sought to prohibit the small American branch of the sect from engaging in the practice, on the ground that the Controlled Substances Act bars all use of the hallucinogen. The sect sued to block enforcement against it of the ban on the sacramental tea, and moved for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p>It relied on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, which prohibits the Federal Government from substantially burdening a person's exercise of religion, unless the Government \"demonstrates that application of the burden to the person\" represents the least restrictive means of advancing a compelling interest. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b). The District Court granted the preliminary injunction, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. We granted the Government's petition for certiorari. Before this Court, the Government's central submission is that it has a compelling interest in the <i>uniform</i> application of the Controlled Substances Act, such that no exception to the ban on use of the hallucinogen can be made to accommodate the sect's sincere religious practice. We conclude that the Government has not carried the burden expressly placed on it by Congress in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and affirm the grant of the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*424</span> I</h2>\n<p>In <i>Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore.</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> 494 U.S. 872 (1990), this Court held that the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment does not prohibit governments from burdening religious practices through generally applicable laws. In <i>Smith,</i> we rejected a challenge to an Oregon statute that denied unemployment benefits to drug users, including Native Americans engaged in the sacramental use of peyote. <i>Id.,</i> at 890. In so doing, we rejected the interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause announced in <i>Sherbert</i> v. <i>Verner,</i> 374 U.S. 398 (1963), and, in accord with earlier cases, see <i>Smith,</i> 494 U.S., at 879-880, 884-885, held that the Constitution does not require judges to engage in a case-by-case assessment of the religious burdens imposed by facially constitutional laws. <i>Id.,</i> at 883-890.</p>\n<p>Congress responded by enacting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 107 Stat. 1488, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb <i>et seq.,</i> which adopts a statutory rule comparable to the constitutional rule rejected in <i>Smith.</i> Under RFRA, the Federal Government may not, as a statutory matter, substantially burden a person's exercise of religion, \"even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability.\" § 2000bb-1(a). The only exception recognized by the statute requires the Government to satisfy the compelling interest testto \"demonstrat[e] that application of the burden to the person(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\" § 2000bb-1(b). A person whose religious practices are burdened in violation of RFRA \"may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief.\" § 2000bb-1(c).<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*425</span> The Controlled Substances Act, 84 Stat. 1242, as amended, 21 U.S.C. § 801 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. I), regulates the importation, manufacture, distribution, and use of psychotropic substances. The Act classifies substances into five schedules based on their potential for abuse, the extent to which they have an accepted medical use, and their safety. See § 812(b) (2000 ed.). Substances listed in Schedule I of the Act are subject to the most comprehensive restrictions, including an outright ban on all importation and use, except pursuant to strictly regulated research projects. See §§ 823, 960(a)(1). The Act authorizes the imposition of a criminal sentence for simple possession of Schedule I substances, see § 844(a), and mandates the imposition of a criminal sentence for possession \"with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense\" such substances, see §§ 841(a), (b).</p>\n<p>O Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal (UDV) is a Christian Spiritist sect based in Brazil, with an American branch of approximately 130 individuals. Central to the UDV's faith is receiving communion through <i>hoasca</i> (pronounced \"wass-ca\"), a sacramental tea made from two plants unique to the Amazon region. One of the plants, <i>psychotriaviridis,</i> contains dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a hallucinogen whose effects are enhanced by alkaloids from the other plant, <i>banisteriopsis caapi.</i> DMT, as well as \"any material, compound, mixture, or preparation, which contains any quantity of [DMT],\" is listed in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. § 812(c), Schedule I(c).</p>\n<p>In 1999, United States Customs inspectors intercepted a shipment to the American UDV containing three drums of <i>hoasca.</i> A subsequent investigation revealed that the UDV had received 14 prior shipments of <i>hoasca.</i> The inspectors seized the intercepted shipment and threatened the UDV with prosecution.</p>\n<p>The UDV filed suit against the Attorney General and other federal law enforcement officials, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The complaint alleged, <i>inter alia,</i> that applying the Controlled Substances Act to the UDV's sacramental <span class=\"star-pagination\">*426</span> use of <i>hoasca</i> violates RFRA. Prior to trial, the UDV moved for a preliminary injunction, so that it could continue to practice its faith pending trial on the merits.</p>\n<p>At a hearing on the preliminary injunction, the Government conceded that the challenged application of the Controlled Substances Act would substantially burden a sincere exercise of religion by the UDV. See <i>O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 282 F. Supp. 2d 1236, 1252 (NM 2002). The Government argued, however, that this burden did not violate RFRA, because applying the Controlled Substances Act in this case was the least restrictive means of advancing three compelling governmental interests: protecting the health and safety of UDV members, preventing the diversion of <i>hoasca</i> from the church to recreational users, and complying with the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances, a treaty signed by the United States and implemented by the Act. Feb. 21, 1971, [1979-1980] 32 U.S. T. 543, T. I. A. S. No. 9725. See 282 F. Supp. 2d, at 1252-1253.</p>\n<p>The District Court heard evidence from both parties on the health risks of <i>hoasca</i> and the potential for diversion from the church. The Government presented evidence to the effect that use of <i>hoasca,</i> or DMT more generally, can cause psychotic reactions, cardiac irregularities, and adverse drug interactions. The UDV countered by citing studies documenting the safety of its sacramental use of <i>hoasca</i> and presenting evidence that minimized the likelihood of the health risks raised by the Government. With respect to diversion, the Government pointed to a general rise in the illicit use of hallucinogens, and cited interest in the illegal use of DMT and <i>hoasca</i> in particular; the UDV emphasized the thinness of any market for <i>hoasca,</i> the relatively small amounts of the substance imported by the church, and the absence of any diversion problem in the past.</p>\n<p>The District Court concluded that the evidence on health risks was \"in equipoise,\" and similarly that the evidence on diversion was \"virtually balanced.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1262, 1266. In <span class=\"star-pagination\">*427</span> the face of such an even showing, the court reasoned that the Government had failed to demonstrate a compelling interest justifying what it acknowledged was a substantial burden on the UDV's sincere religious exercise. <i>Id.,</i> at 1255. The court also rejected the asserted interest in complying with the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, holding that the Convention does not apply to <i>hoasca. Id.,</i> at 1266-1269.</p>\n<p>The court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Government from enforcing the Controlled Substances Act with respect to the UDV's importation and use of <i>hoasca.</i> The injunction requires the church to import the tea pursuant to federal permits, to restrict control over the tea to persons of church authority, and to warn particularly susceptible UDV members of the dangers of <i>hoasca.</i> See Preliminary Injunction ¶¶ 2, 5-12, 32-33, App. F to App. to Pet. for Cert. 249a, 250a-252a, 258a-259a. The injunction also provides that \"if [the Government] believe[s] that evidence exists that <i>hoasca</i> has negatively affected the health of UDV members,\" or \"that a shipment of <i>hoasca</i> contain[s] particularly dangerous levels of DMT, [the Government] may apply to the Court for an expedite[d] determination of whether the evidence warrants suspension or revocation of [the UDV's authority to use <i>hoasca</i>].\" <i>Id.,</i> at 257a, ¶ 29.</p>\n<p>The Government appealed the preliminary injunction and a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed, <i>O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 342 F.3d 1170 (2003), as did a majority of the Circuit sitting en banc, 389 F.3d 973 (2004). We granted certiorari. 544 U.S. 973 (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Although its briefs contain some discussion of the potential for harm and diversion from the UDV's use of <i>hoasca,</i> the Government does not challenge the District Court's factual findings or its conclusion that the evidence submitted on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*428</span> these issues was evenly balanced. Instead, the Government maintains that such evidentiary equipoise is an insufficient basis for issuing a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act. We review the District Court's legal rulings <i>de novo</i> and its ultimate decision to issue the preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. See <i>McCreary County</i> v. <i>American Civil Liberties Union of Ky.,</i> 545 U.S. 844, 867 (2005).</p>\n<p>The Government begins by invoking the well-established principle that the party seeking pretrial relief bears the burden of demonstrating a likelihood of success on the merits. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Mazurek</i> v. <i>Armstrong,</i> 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997) (<i>per curiam</i>); <i>Doran</i> v. <i>Salem Inn, Inc.,</i> 422 U.S. 922, 931 (1975). The Government argues that the District Court lost sight of this principle in issuing the injunction based on a mere tie in the evidentiary record.</p>\n<p>A majority of the en banc Court of Appeals rejected this argument, and so do we. Before the District Court, the Government conceded the UDV's prima facie case under RFRA. See 282 F. Supp. 2d, at 1252 (application of the Controlled Substances Act would (1) substantially burden (2) a sincere (3) religious exercise). The evidence the District Court found to be in equipoise related to two of the compelling interests asserted by the Government, which formed part of the Government's affirmative defense. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b) (\"Government may substantially burden a person's exercise of religion only if <i>it demonstrates</i> that application of the burden to the person(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest ...\" (emphasis added)); § 2000bb-2(3) (\"[T]he term `demonstrates' means meets the burdens of going forward with the evidence and of persuasion\"). Accordingly, the UDV effectively demonstrated that its sincere exercise of religion was substantially burdened, and the Government failed to demonstrate that the application of the burden to the UDV would, more likely than not, be justified by the asserted compelling interests. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*429</span> See 389 F.3d, at 1009 (SEYMOUR, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"[T]he balance is between actual irreparable harm to [the] plaintiff and potential harm to the government which does not even rise to the level of a preponderance of the evidence\").</p>\n<p>The Government argues that, although it would bear the burden of demonstrating a compelling interest as part of its affirmative defense at trial on the merits, the UDV should have borne the burden of disproving the asserted compelling interests at the hearing on the preliminary injunction. This argument is foreclosed by our recent decision in <i>Ashcroft</i> v. <i>American Civil Liberties Union,</i> 542 U.S. 656 (2004). In <i>Ashcroft,</i> we affirmed the grant of a preliminary injunction in a case where the Government had failed to show a likelihood of success under the compelling interest test. We reasoned that \"[a]s the Government bears the burden of proof on the ultimate question of [the challenged Act's] constitutionality, respondents [the movants] must be deemed likely to prevail unless the Government has shown that respondents' proposed less restrictive alternatives are less effective than [enforcing the Act].\" <i>Id.,</i> at 666. That logic extends to this case; here the Government failed on the first prong of the compelling interest test, and did not reach the least restrictive means prong, but that can make no difference. The point remains that the burdens at the preliminary injunction stage track the burdens at trial.</p>\n<p>The Government attempts to limit the rule announced in <i>Ashcroft</i> to content-based restrictions on speech, but the distinction is unavailing. The fact that <i>Ashcroft</i> involved such a restriction was the reason the Government had the burden of proof at trial under the First Amendment, see <i>id.,</i> at 665, but in no way affected the Court's assessment of the consequences of having that burden for purposes of the preliminary injunction. Here the burden is placed squarely on the Government by RFRA rather than the First Amendment, see 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb-1(b), 2000bb-2(3), but the consequences <span class=\"star-pagination\">*430</span> are the same. Congress's express decision to legislate the compelling interest test indicates that RFRA challenges should be adjudicated in the same manner as constitutionally mandated applications of the test, including at the preliminary injunction stage.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Government's second line of argument rests on the Controlled Substances Act itself. The Government contends that the Act's description of Schedule I substances as having \"a high potential for abuse,\" \"no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States,\" and \"a lack of accepted safety for use . . . under medical supervision,\" 21 U.S.C. § 812(b)(1), by itself precludes any consideration of individualized exceptions such as that sought by the UDV. The Government goes on to argue that the regulatory regime established by the Acta \"closed\" system that prohibits all use of controlled substances except as authorized by the Act itself, see <i>Gonzales</i> v. <i>Raich,</i> 545 U.S. 1, 13 (2005) \"cannot function with its necessary rigor and comprehensiveness if subjected to judicial exemptions.\" Brief for Petitioners 18. According to the Government, there would be no way to cabin religious exceptions once recognized, and \"the public will misread\" such exceptions as signaling that the substance at issue is not harmful after all. <i>Id.,</i> at 23. Under the Government's view, there is no need to assess the particulars of the UDV's use or weigh the impact of an exemption for that specific use, because the Controlled Substances Act serves a compelling purpose and simply admits of no exceptions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>RFRA, and the strict scrutiny test it adopted, contemplate an inquiry more focused than the Government's categorical approach. RFRA requires the Government to demonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through application of the challenged law \"to the person\"the particular <span class=\"star-pagination\">*431</span> claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b). RFRA expressly adopted the compelling interest test \"as set forth in <i>Sherbert</i> v. <i>Verner,</i> 374 U.S. 398 (1963) and <i>Wisconsin</i> v. <i>Yoder,</i> 406 U.S. 205 (1972).\" § 2000bb(b)(1). In each of those cases, this Court looked beyond broadly formulated interests justifying the general applicability of government mandates and scrutinized the asserted harm of granting specific exemptions to particular religious claimants. In <i>Yoder,</i> for example, we permitted an exemption for Amish children from a compulsory school attendance law. We recognized that the State had a \"paramount\" interest in education, but held that \"despite its admitted validity in the generality of cases, we must searchingly examine the interests that the State seeks to promote . . . and the impediment to those objectives that would flow from recognizing <i>the claimed Amish exemption.</i>\" 406 U.S., at 213, 221 (emphasis added). The Court explained that the State needed \"to show with more particularity how its admittedly strong interest . . . would be adversely affected by granting an exemption <i>to the Amish.</i>\" <i>Id.,</i> at 236 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>In <i>Sherbert,</i> the Court upheld a particular claim to a religious exemption from a state law denying unemployment benefits to those who would not work on Saturdays, but explained that it was not announcing a constitutional right to unemployment benefits for \"<i>all</i> persons whose religious convictions are the cause of their unemployment.\" 374 U.S., at 410 (emphasis added). The Court distinguished the case \"in which an employee's religious convictions serve to make him a nonproductive member of society.\" <i>Ibid.;</i> see also <i>Smith,</i> 494 U.S., at 899 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment) (strict scrutiny \"at least requires a case-by-case determination of the question, sensitive to the facts of each particular claim\"). Outside the Free Exercise area as well, the Court has noted that \"[c]ontext matters\" in applying the compelling interest test, <i>Grutter</i> v. <i>Bollinger,</i> 539 U.S. 306, 327 (2003), and has <span class=\"star-pagination\">*432</span> emphasized that \"strict scrutiny <i>does</i> take `relevant differences' into accountindeed, that is its fundamental purpose,\" <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Peña,</i> 515 U.S. 200, 228 (1995).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Under the more focused inquiry required by RFRA and the compelling interest test, the Government's mere invocation of the general characteristics of Schedule I substances, as set forth in the Controlled Substances Act, cannot carry the day. It is true, of course, that Schedule I substances such as DMT are exceptionally dangerous. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Touby</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 500 U.S. 160, 162 (1991). Nevertheless, there is no indication that Congress, in classifying DMT, considered the harms posed by the particular use at issue here the circumscribed, sacramental use of <i>hoasca</i> by the UDV. The question of the harms from the sacramental use of <i>hoasca</i> by the UDV <i>was</i> litigated below. Before the District Court found that the Government had not carried its burden of showing a compelling interest in preventing such harms, the court noted that it could not \"ignore that the legislative branch of the government elected to place materials containing DMT in Schedule I of the [Act], reflecting findings that substances containing DMT have `a high potential for abuse,' and `no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States,' and that `[t]here is a lack of accepted safety for use of [DMT] under medical supervision.'\" 282 F. Supp. 2d, at 1254. But Congress' determination that DMT should be listed under Schedule I simply does not provide a categorical answer that relieves the Government of the obligation to shoulder its burden under RFRA.</p>\n<p>This conclusion is reinforced by the Controlled Substances Act itself. The Act contains a provision authorizing the Attorney General to \"waive the requirement for registration of certain manufacturers, distributors, or dispensers if he finds it consistent with the public health and safety.\" 21 U.S.C. § 822(d). The fact that the Act itself contemplates that exempting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*433</span> certain people from its requirements would be \"consistent with the public health and safety\" indicates that congressional findings with respect to Schedule I substances should not carry the determinative weight, for RFRA purposes, that the Government would ascribe to them.</p>\n<p>And in fact an exception has been made to the Schedule I ban for religious use. For the past 35 years, there has been a regulatory exemption for use of peyotea Schedule I substanceby the Native American Church. See 21 CFR § 1307.31 (2005). In 1994, Congress extended that exemption to all members of every recognized Indian Tribe. See 42 U.S.C. § 1996a(b)(1). Everything the Government says about the DMT in <i>hoasca</i>that, as a Schedule I substance, Congress has determined that it \"has a high potential for abuse,\" \"has no currently accepted medical use,\" and has \"a lack of accepted safety for use . . . under medical supervision,\" 21 U.S.C. § 812(b)(1)applies in equal measure to the mescaline in peyote, yet both the Executive and Congress itself have decreed an exception from the Controlled Substances Act for Native American religious use of peyote. If such use is permitted in the face of the congressional findings in § 812(b)(1) for hundreds of thousands of Native Americans practicing their faith, it is difficult to see how those same findings alone can preclude any consideration of a similar exception for the 130 or so American members of the UDV who want to practice theirs. See <i>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.</i> v. <i>Hialeah,</i> 508 U.S. 520, 547 (1993) (\"It is established in our strict scrutiny jurisprudence that `a law cannot be regarded as protecting an interest `of the highest order' ... when it leaves appreciable damage to that supposedly vital interest unprohibited'\" (quoting <i>Florida Star</i> v. <i>B. J. F.,</i> 491 U.S. 524, 541-542 (1989) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment))).</p>\n<p>The Government responds that there is a \"unique relationship\" between the United States and the Tribes, Brief for Petitioners 27; see <i>Morton</i> v. <i>Mancari,</i> 417 U.S. 535 (1974), <span class=\"star-pagination\">*434</span> but never explains what about that \"unique\" relationship justifies overriding the same congressional findings on which the Government relies in resisting any exception for the UDV's religious use of <i>hoasca.</i> In other words, if any Schedule I substance is in fact <i>always</i> highly dangerous in any amount no matter how used, what about the unique relationship with the Tribes justifies allowing their use of peyote? Nothing about the unique political status of the Tribes makes their members immune from the health risks the Government asserts accompany any use of a Schedule I substance, nor insulates the Schedule I substance the Tribes use in religious exercise from the alleged risk of diversion.</p>\n<p>The Government argues that the existence of a <i>congressional</i> exemption for peyote does not indicate that the Controlled Substances Act is amenable to <i>judicially crafted</i> exceptions. RFRA, however, plainly contemplates that <i>courts</i> would recognize exceptionsthat is how the law works. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(c) (\"A person whose religious exercise has been burdened in violation of this section may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government\"). Congress' role in the peyote exemptionand the Executive's, see 21 CFR § 1307.31 (2005)confirms that the findings in the Controlled Substances Act do not preclude exceptions altogether; RFRA makes clear that it is the obligation of the courts to consider whether exceptions are required under the test set forth by Congress.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The well-established peyote exception also fatally undermines the Government's broader contention that the Controlled Substances Act establishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under RFRA. The Government argues that the effectiveness of the Controlled Substances Act will be \"necessarily . . . undercut\" if the Act is not uniformly applied, without regard to burdens on religious exercise. Brief for Petitioners 18. The peyote exception, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*435</span> however, has been in place since the outset of the Controlled Substances Act, and there is no evidence that it has \"undercut\" the Government's ability to enforce the ban on peyote use by non-Indians.</p>\n<p>The Government points to some pre-<i>Smith</i> cases relying on a need for uniformity in rejecting claims for religious exemptions under the Free Exercise Clause, see Brief for Petitioners 16, but those cases strike us as quite different from the present one. Those cases did not embrace the notion that a general interest in uniformity justified a substantial burden on religious exercise; they instead scrutinized the asserted need and explained why the denied exemptions could not be accommodated. In <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lee,</i> 455 U.S. 252 (1982), for example, the Court rejected a claimed exception to the obligation to pay Social Security taxes, noting that \"mandatory participation is indispensable to the fiscal vitality of the social security system\" and that the \"tax system could not function if denominations were allowed to challenge the tax system because tax payments were spent in a manner that violates their religious belief.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 258, 260. See also <i>Hernandez</i> v. <i>Commissioner,</i> 490 U.S. 680, 700 (1989) (same). In <i>Braunfeld</i> v. <i>Brown,</i> 366 U.S. 599 (1961) (plurality opinion), the Court denied a claimed exception to Sunday closing laws, in part because allowing such exceptions \"might well provide [the claimants] with an economic Fadvantage over their competitors who must remain closed on that day.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 608-609. The whole point of a \"uniform day of rest for all workers\" would have been defeated by exceptions. See <i>Sherbert,</i> 374 U.S., at 408 (discussing <i>Braunfeld</i>). These cases show that the Government can demonstrate a compelling interest in uniform application of a particular program by offering evidence that granting the requested religious accommodations would seriously compromise its ability to administer the program.</p>\n<p>Here the Government's argument for uniformity is different; it rests not so much on the particular statutory program at issue as on slippery-slope concerns that could be invoked <span class=\"star-pagination\">*436</span> in response to any RFRA claim for an exception to a generally applicable law. The Government's argument echoes the classic rejoinder of bureaucrats throughout history: If I make an exception for you, I'll have to make one for everybody, so no exceptions. But RFRA operates by mandating consideration, under the compelling interest test, of exceptions to \"rule[s] of general applicability.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a). Congress determined that the legislated test \"is a workable test for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests.\" § 2000bb(a)(5). This determination finds support in our cases; in <i>Sherbert,</i> for example, we rejected a slippery-slope argument similar to the one offered in this case, dismissing as \"no more than a possibility\" the State's speculation \"that the filing of fraudulent claims by unscrupulous claimants feigning religious objections to Saturday work\" would drain the unemployment benefits fund. 374 U.S., at 407.</p>\n<p>We reaffirmed just last Term the feasibility of case-by-case consideration of religious exemptions to generally applicable rules. In <i>Cutter</i> v. <i>Wilkinson,</i> 544 U.S. 709 (2005), we held that the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, which allows federal and state prisoners to seek religious accommodations pursuant to the same standard as set forth in RFRA, does not violate the Establishment Clause. We had \"no cause to believe\" that the compelling interest test \"would not be applied in an appropriately balanced way\" to specific claims for exemptions as they arose. <i>Id.,</i> at 722. Nothing in our opinion suggested that courts were not up to the task.</p>\n<p>We do not doubt that there may be instances in which a need for uniformity precludes the recognition of exceptions to generally applicable laws under RFRA. But it would have been surprising to find that this was such a case, given the longstanding exemption from the Controlled Substances Act for religious use of peyote, and the fact that the very reason Congress enacted RFRA was to respond to a decision <span class=\"star-pagination\">*437</span> denying a claimed right to sacramental use of a controlled substance. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb(a)(4). And in fact the Government has not offered evidence demonstrating that granting the UDV an exemption would cause the kind of administrative harm recognized as a compelling interest in <i>Lee, Hernandez,</i> and <i>Braunfeld.</i> The Government failed to convince the District Court at the preliminary injunction hearing that health or diversion concerns provide a compelling interest in banning the UDV's sacramental use of <i>hoasca.</i> It cannot compensate for that failure now with the bold argument that there can be no RFRA exceptions at all to the Controlled Substances Act. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 17 (Deputy Solicitor General statement that exception could not be made even for \"rigorously policed\" use of \"one drop\" of substance \"once a year\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Before the District Court, the Government also asserted an interest in compliance with the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances, Feb. 21, 1971, [1979-1980] 32 U.S. T. 543, T. I. A. S. No. 9725. The Convention, signed by the United States and implemented by the Controlled Substances Act, calls on signatories to prohibit the use of hallucinogens, including DMT. The Government argues that it has a compelling interest in meeting its international obligations by complying with the Convention.</p>\n<p>The District Court rejected this interest because it found that the Convention does not cover <i>hoasca.</i> The court relied on the official commentary to the Convention, which notes that \"Schedule I [of the Convention] does not list . . . natural hallucinogenic materials,\" and that \"[p]lants as such are not, andit is submittedare also not likely to be, listed in Schedule I, but only some products obtained from plants.\" U. N. Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances 387, 385 (1976). The court reasoned that <i>hoasca,</i> like the plants from which the tea is made, is sufficiently distinct from DMT itself to fall outside the treaty. See 282 F. Supp. 2d, at 1266-1269.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*438</span> We do not agree. The Convention provides that \"a preparation is subject to the same measures of control as the psychotropic substance which it contains,\" and defines \"preparation\" as \"any solution or mixture, in whatever physical state, containing one or more psychotropic substances.\" See 32 U.S. T., at 546, Art. 1(f)(i); <i>id.,</i> at 551, Art. 3. <i>Hoasca</i> is a \"solution or mixture\" containing DMT; the fact that it is made by the simple process of brewing plants in water, as opposed to some more advanced method, does not change that. To the extent the commentary suggests plants themselves are not covered by the Convention, that is of no momentthe UDV seeks to import and use a tea brewed from plants, not the plants themselves, and the tea plainly qualifies as a \"preparation\" under the Convention.</p>\n<p>The fact that <i>hoasca</i> is covered by the Convention, however, does not automatically mean that the Government has demonstrated a compelling interest in applying the Controlled Substances Act, which implements the Convention, to the UDV's sacramental use of the tea. At the present stage, it suffices to observe that the Government did not even <i>submit</i> evidence addressing the international consequences of granting an exemption for the UDV. The Government simply submitted two affidavits by State Department officials attesting to the general importance of honoring international obligations and of maintaining the leadership position of the United States in the international war on drugs. See Declaration of Gary T. Sheridan (Jan. 24, 2001), App. G to App. to Pet. for Cert. 261a; Declaration of Robert E. Dalton (Jan. 24, 2001), App. H, <i>id.,</i> at 265a. We do not doubt the validity of these interests, any more than we doubt the general interest in promoting public health and safety by enforcing the Controlled Substances Act, but under RFRA invocation of such general interests, standing alone, is not enough.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*439</span> * * *</h2>\n<p>The Government repeatedly invokes Congress' findings and purposes underlying the Controlled Substances Act, but Congress had a reason for enacting RFRA, too. Congress recognized that \"laws `neutral' toward religion may burden religious exercise as surely as laws intended to interfere with religious exercise,\" and legislated \"the compelling interest test\" as the means for the courts to \"strik[e] sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests.\" 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb(a)(2), (5).</p>\n<p>We have no cause to pretend that the task assigned by Congress to the courts under RFRA is an easy one. Indeed, the very sort of difficulties highlighted by the Government here were cited by this Court in deciding that the approach later mandated by Congress under RFRA was not required as a matter of constitutional law under the Free Exercise Clause. See <i>Smith,</i> 494 U.S., at 885-890. But Congress has determined that courts should strike sensible balances, pursuant to a compelling interest test that requires the Government to address the particular practice at issue. Applying that test, we conclude that the courts below did not err in determining that the Government failed to demonstrate, at the preliminary injunction stage, a compelling interest in barring the UDV's sacramental use of <i>hoasca.</i></p>\n<p>The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is affirmed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  <i>Marci A.

The Government concedes that this practice is a sincere exercise of religion, but nonetheless sought to prohibit the small American branch of the sect from engaging in the practice, on the ground that the Controlled Substances Act bars all use of the hallucinogen. The sect sued to block enforcement against it of the ban on the sacramental tea, and moved for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p>It relied on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, which prohibits the Federal Government from substantially burdening a person's exercise of religion, unless the Government \"demonstrates that application of the burden to the person\" represents the least restrictive means of advancing a compelling interest. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b). The District Court granted the preliminary injunction, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. We granted the Government's petition for certiorari. Before this Court, the Government's central submission is that it has a compelling interest in the <i>uniform</i> application of the Controlled Substances Act, such that no exception to the ban on use of the hallucinogen can be made to accommodate the sect's sincere religious practice. We conclude that the Government has not carried the burden expressly placed on it by Congress in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and affirm the grant of the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*424</span> I</h2>\n<p>In <i>Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore.</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112404\"><a href=\"/opinion/112404/employment-div-dept-of-human-resources-of-ore-v-sm/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">872</span></a></span> (1990), this Court held that the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment does not prohibit governments from burdening religious practices through generally applicable laws. In <i>Smith,</i> we rejected a challenge to an Oregon statute that denied unemployment benefits to drug users, including Native Americans engaged in the sacramental use of peyote. <i>Id.,</i> at 890. In so doing, we rejected the interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause announced in <i>Sherbert</i> v. <i>Verner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106660\"><a href=\"/opinion/106660/sherbert-v-verner/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span> (1963), and, in accord with earlier cases, see <i>Smith,</i> 494 U.S., at 879-880, 884-885, held that the Constitution does not require judges to engage in a case-by-case assessment of the religious burdens imposed by facially constitutional laws. <i>Id.,</i> at 883-890.</p>\n<p>Congress responded by enacting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 107 Stat. 1488, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb <i>et seq.,</i> which adopts a statutory rule comparable to the constitutional rule rejected in <i>Smith.</i> Under RFRA, the Federal Government may not, as a statutory matter, substantially burden a person's exercise of religion, \"even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability.\" § 2000bb-1(a). The only exception recognized by the statute requires the Government to satisfy the compelling interest testto \"demonstrat[e] that application of the burden to the person(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\" § 2000bb-1(b). A person whose religious practices are burdened in violation of RFRA \"may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief.\" § 2000bb-1(c).<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*425</span> The Controlled Substances Act, 84 Stat. 1242, as amended, 21 U.S.C. § 801 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. I), regulates the importation, manufacture, distribution, and use of psychotropic substances. The Act classifies substances into five schedules based on their potential for abuse, the extent to which they have an accepted medical use, and their safety. See § 812(b) (2000 ed.). Substances listed in Schedule I of the Act are subject to the most comprehensive restrictions, including an outright ban on all importation and use, except pursuant to strictly regulated research projects. See §§ 823, 960(a)(1). The Act authorizes the imposition of a criminal sentence for simple possession of Schedule I substances, see § 844(a), and mandates the imposition of a criminal sentence for possession \"with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense\" such substances, see §§ 841(a), (b).</p>\n<p>O Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal (UDV) is a Christian Spiritist sect based in Brazil, with an American branch of approximately 130 individuals. Central to the UDV's faith is receiving communion through <i>hoasca</i> (pronounced \"wass-ca\"), a sacramental tea made from two plants unique to the Amazon region. One of the plants, <i>psychotriaviridis,</i> contains dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a hallucinogen whose effects are enhanced by alkaloids from the other plant, <i>banisteriopsis caapi.</i> DMT, as well as \"any material, compound, mixture, or preparation, which contains any quantity of [DMT],\" is listed in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. § 812(c), Schedule I(c).</p>\n<p>In 1999, United States Customs inspectors intercepted a shipment to the American UDV containing three drums of <i>hoasca.</i> A subsequent investigation revealed that the UDV had received 14 prior shipments of <i>hoasca.</i> The inspectors seized the intercepted shipment and threatened the UDV with prosecution.</p>\n<p>The UDV filed suit against the Attorney General and other federal law enforcement officials, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The complaint alleged, <i>inter alia,</i> that applying the Controlled Substances Act to the UDV's sacramental <span class=\"star-pagination\">*426</span> use of <i>hoasca</i> violates RFRA. Prior to trial, the UDV moved for a preliminary injunction, so that it could continue to practice its faith pending trial on the merits.</p>\n<p>At a hearing on the preliminary injunction, the Government conceded that the challenged application of the Controlled Substances Act would substantially burden a sincere exercise of religion by the UDV. See <i>O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2480162\"><a href=\"/opinion/2480162/o-centro-espirita-beneficiente-uniao-do-vegetal-v-/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1236</span></a></span>, 1252 (NM 2002). The Government argued, however, that this burden did not violate RFRA, because applying the Controlled Substances Act in this case was the least restrictive means of advancing three compelling governmental interests: protecting the health and safety of UDV members, preventing the diversion of <i>hoasca</i> from the church to recreational users, and complying with the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances, a treaty signed by the United States and implemented by the Act. Feb. 21, 1971, [1979-1980] 32 U.S. T. 543, T. I. A. S. No. 9725. See 282 F. Supp. 2d, at 1252-1253.</p>\n<p>The District Court heard evidence from both parties on the health risks of <i>hoasca</i> and the potential for diversion from the church. The Government presented evidence to the effect that use of <i>hoasca,</i> or DMT more generally, can cause psychotic reactions, cardiac irregularities, and adverse drug interactions. The UDV countered by citing studies documenting the safety of its sacramental use of <i>hoasca</i> and presenting evidence that minimized the likelihood of the health risks raised by the Government. With respect to diversion, the Government pointed to a general rise in the illicit use of hallucinogens, and cited interest in the illegal use of DMT and <i>hoasca</i> in particular; the UDV emphasized the thinness of any market for <i>hoasca,</i> the relatively small amounts of the substance imported by the church, and the absence of any diversion problem in the past.</p>\n<p>The District Court concluded that the evidence on health risks was \"in equipoise,\" and similarly that the evidence on diversion was \"virtually balanced.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1262, 1266. In <span class=\"star-pagination\">*427</span> the face of such an even showing, the court reasoned that the Government had failed to demonstrate a compelling interest justifying what it acknowledged was a substantial burden on the UDV's sincere religious exercise. <i>Id.,</i> at 1255. The court also rejected the asserted interest in complying with the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, holding that the Convention does not apply to <i>hoasca. Id.,</i> at 1266-1269.</p>\n<p>The court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Government from enforcing the Controlled Substances Act with respect to the UDV's importation and use of <i>hoasca.</i> The injunction requires the church to import the tea pursuant to federal permits, to restrict control over the tea to persons of church authority, and to warn particularly susceptible UDV members of the dangers of <i>hoasca.</i> See Preliminary Injunction ¶¶ 2, 5-12, 32-33, App. F to App. to Pet. for Cert. 249a, 250a-252a, 258a-259a. The injunction also provides that \"if [the Government] believe[s] that evidence exists that <i>hoasca</i> has negatively affected the health of UDV members,\" or \"that a shipment of <i>hoasca</i> contain[s] particularly dangerous levels of DMT, [the Government] may apply to the Court for an expedite[d] determination of whether the evidence warrants suspension or revocation of [the UDV's authority to use <i>hoasca</i>].\" <i>Id.,</i> at 257a, ¶ 29.</p>\n<p>The Government appealed the preliminary injunction and a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed, <i>O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"163852\"><a href=\"/opinion/163852/o-centro-espirita-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1170</span></a></span> (2003), as did a majority of the Circuit sitting en banc, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788429\"><a href=\"/opinion/788429/o-centro-espirita-beneficiente-uniao-do-vegetal-al/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">973</span></a></span> (2004). We granted certiorari. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">973</span></span> (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Although its briefs contain some discussion of the potential for harm and diversion from the UDV's use of <i>hoasca,</i> the Government does not challenge the District Court's factual findings or its conclusion that the evidence submitted on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*428</span> these issues was evenly balanced. Instead, the Government maintains that such evidentiary equipoise is an insufficient basis for issuing a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act. We review the District Court's legal rulings <i>de novo</i> and its ultimate decision to issue the preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. See <i>McCreary County</i> v. <i>American Civil Liberties Union of Ky.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799993\"><a href=\"/opinion/799993/mccreary-county-v-american-civil-liberties-union-o/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span>, 867 (2005).</p>\n<p>The Government begins by invoking the well-established principle that the party seeking pretrial relief bears the burden of demonstrating a likelihood of success on the merits. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Mazurek</i> v. <i>Armstrong,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1088006\"><a href=\"/opinion/1088006/mazurek-v-armstrong/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">968</span></a></span>, 972 (1997) (<i>per curiam</i>); <i>Doran</i> v. <i>Salem Inn, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109314\"><a href=\"/opinion/109314/doran-v-salem-inn-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span>, 931 (1975). The Government argues that the District Court lost sight of this principle in issuing the injunction based on a mere tie in the evidentiary record.</p>\n<p>A majority of the en banc Court of Appeals rejected this argument, and so do we. Before the District Court, the Government conceded the UDV's prima facie case under RFRA. See 282 F. Supp. 2d, at 1252 (application of the Controlled Substances Act would (1) substantially burden (2) a sincere (3) religious exercise). The evidence the District Court found to be in equipoise related to two of the compelling interests asserted by the Government, which formed part of the Government's affirmative defense. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b) (\"Government may substantially burden a person's exercise of religion only if <i>it demonstrates</i> that application of the burden to the person(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest ...\" (emphasis added)); § 2000bb-2(3) (\"[T]he term `demonstrates' means meets the burdens of going forward with the evidence and of persuasion\"). Accordingly, the UDV effectively demonstrated that its sincere exercise of religion was substantially burdened, and the Government failed to demonstrate that the application of the burden to the UDV would, more likely than not, be justified by the asserted compelling interests. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*429</span> See 389 F.3d, at 1009 (SEYMOUR, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"[T]he balance is between actual irreparable harm to [the] plaintiff and potential harm to the government which does not even rise to the level of a preponderance of the evidence\").</p>\n<p>The Government argues that, although it would bear the burden of demonstrating a compelling interest as part of its affirmative defense at trial on the merits, the UDV should have borne the burden of disproving the asserted compelling interests at the hearing on the preliminary injunction. This argument is foreclosed by our recent decision in <i>Ashcroft</i> v. <i>American Civil Liberties Union,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137005\"><a href=\"/opinion/137005/ashcroft-v-american-civil-liberties-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span> (2004). In <i>Ashcroft,</i> we affirmed the grant of a preliminary injunction in a case where the Government had failed to show a likelihood of success under the compelling interest test. We reasoned that \"[a]s the Government bears the burden of proof on the ultimate question of [the challenged Act's] constitutionality, respondents [the movants] must be deemed likely to prevail unless the Government has shown that respondents' proposed less restrictive alternatives are less effective than [enforcing the Act].\" <i>Id.,</i> at 666. That logic extends to this case; here the Government failed on the first prong of the compelling interest test, and did not reach the least restrictive means prong, but that can make no difference. The point remains that the burdens at the preliminary injunction stage track the burdens at trial.</p>\n<p>The Government attempts to limit the rule announced in <i>Ashcroft</i> to content-based restrictions on speech, but the distinction is unavailing. The fact that <i>Ashcroft</i> involved such a restriction was the reason the Government had the burden of proof at trial under the First Amendment, see <i>id.,</i> at 665, but in no way affected the Court's assessment of the consequences of having that burden for purposes of the preliminary injunction. Here the burden is placed squarely on the Government by RFRA rather than the First Amendment, see 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb-1(b), 2000bb-2(3), but the consequences <span class=\"star-pagination\">*430</span> are the same. Congress's express decision to legislate the compelling interest test indicates that RFRA challenges should be adjudicated in the same manner as constitutionally mandated applications of the test, including at the preliminary injunction stage.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The Government's second line of argument rests on the Controlled Substances Act itself. The Government contends that the Act's description of Schedule I substances as having \"a high potential for abuse,\" \"no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States,\" and \"a lack of accepted safety for use . . . under medical supervision,\" 21 U.S.C. § 812(b)(1), by itself precludes any consideration of individualized exceptions such as that sought by the UDV. The Government goes on to argue that the regulatory regime established by the Acta \"closed\" system that prohibits all use of controlled substances except as authorized by the Act itself, see <i>Gonzales</i> v. <i>Raich,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799995\"><a href=\"/opinion/799995/gonzales-v-raich/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 13 (2005) \"cannot function with its necessary rigor and comprehensiveness if subjected to judicial exemptions.\" Brief for Petitioners 18. According to the Government, there would be no way to cabin religious exceptions once recognized, and \"the public will misread\" such exceptions as signaling that the substance at issue is not harmful after all. <i>Id.,</i> at 23. Under the Government's view, there is no need to assess the particulars of the UDV's use or weigh the impact of an exemption for that specific use, because the Controlled Substances Act serves a compelling purpose and simply admits of no exceptions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>RFRA, and the strict scrutiny test it adopted, contemplate an inquiry more focused than the Government's categorical approach. RFRA requires the Government to demonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through application of the challenged law \"to the person\"the particular <span class=\"star-pagination\">*431</span> claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b). RFRA expressly adopted the compelling interest test \"as set forth in <i>Sherbert</i> v. <i>Verner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106660\"><a href=\"/opinion/106660/sherbert-v-verner/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span> (1963) and <i>Wisconsin</i> v. <i>Yoder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108530\"><a href=\"/opinion/108530/wisconsin-v-yoder/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span> (1972).\" § 2000bb(b)(1). In each of those cases, this Court looked beyond broadly formulated interests justifying the general applicability of government mandates and scrutinized the asserted harm of granting specific exemptions to particular religious claimants. In <i>Yoder,</i> for example, we permitted an exemption for Amish children from a compulsory school attendance law. We recognized that the State had a \"paramount\" interest in education, but held that \"despite its admitted validity in the generality of cases, we must searchingly examine the interests that the State seeks to promote . . . and the impediment to those objectives that would flow from recognizing <i>the claimed Amish exemption.</i>\" 406 U.S., at 213, 221 (emphasis added). The Court explained that the State needed \"to show with more particularity how its admittedly strong interest . . . would be adversely affected by granting an exemption <i>to the Amish.</i>\" <i>Id.,</i> at 236 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>In <i>Sherbert,</i> the Court upheld a particular claim to a religious exemption from a state law denying unemployment benefits to those who would not work on Saturdays, but explained that it was not announcing a constitutional right to unemployment benefits for \"<i>all</i> persons whose religious convictions are the cause of their unemployment.\" 374 U.S., at 410 (emphasis added). The Court distinguished the case \"in which an employee's religious convictions serve to make him a nonproductive member of society.\" <i>Ibid.;</i> see also <i>Smith,</i> 494 U.S., at 899 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment) (strict scrutiny \"at least requires a case-by-case determination of the question, sensitive to the facts of each particular claim\"). Outside the Free Exercise area as well, the Court has noted that \"[c]ontext matters\" in applying the compelling interest test, <i>Grutter</i> v. <i>Bollinger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span>, 327 (2003), and has <span class=\"star-pagination\">*432</span> emphasized that \"strict scrutiny <i>does</i> take `relevant differences' into accountindeed, that is its fundamental purpose,\" <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Peña,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 228 (1995).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Under the more focused inquiry required by RFRA and the compelling interest test, the Government's mere invocation of the general characteristics of Schedule I substances, as set forth in the Controlled Substances Act, cannot carry the day. It is true, of course, that Schedule I substances such as DMT are exceptionally dangerous. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Touby</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112591\"><a href=\"/opinion/112591/touby-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">160</span></a></span>, 162 (1991). Nevertheless, there is no indication that Congress, in classifying DMT, considered the harms posed by the particular use at issue here the circumscribed, sacramental use of <i>hoasca</i> by the UDV. The question of the harms from the sacramental use of <i>hoasca</i> by the UDV <i>was</i> litigated below. Before the District Court found that the Government had not carried its burden of showing a compelling interest in preventing such harms, the court noted that it could not \"ignore that the legislative branch of the government elected to place materials containing DMT in Schedule I of the [Act], reflecting findings that substances containing DMT have `a high potential for abuse,' and `no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States,' and that `[t]here is a lack of accepted safety for use of [DMT] under medical supervision.'\" 282 F. Supp. 2d, at 1254. But Congress' determination that DMT should be listed under Schedule I simply does not provide a categorical answer that relieves the Government of the obligation to shoulder its burden under RFRA.</p>\n<p>This conclusion is reinforced by the Controlled Substances Act itself. The Act contains a provision authorizing the Attorney General to \"waive the requirement for registration of certain manufacturers, distributors, or dispensers if he finds it consistent with the public health and safety.\" 21 U.S.C. § 822(d). The fact that the Act itself contemplates that exempting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*433</span> certain people from its requirements would be \"consistent with the public health and safety\" indicates that congressional findings with respect to Schedule I substances should not carry the determinative weight, for RFRA purposes, that the Government would ascribe to them.</p>\n<p>And in fact an exception has been made to the Schedule I ban for religious use. For the past 35 years, there has been a regulatory exemption for use of peyotea Schedule I substanceby the Native American Church. See 21 CFR § 1307.31 (2005). In 1994, Congress extended that exemption to all members of every recognized Indian Tribe. See 42 U.S.C. § 1996a(b)(1). Everything the Government says about the DMT in <i>hoasca</i>that, as a Schedule I substance, Congress has determined that it \"has a high potential for abuse,\" \"has no currently accepted medical use,\" and has \"a lack of accepted safety for use . . . under medical supervision,\" 21 U.S.C. § 812(b)(1)applies in equal measure to the mescaline in peyote, yet both the Executive and Congress itself have decreed an exception from the Controlled Substances Act for Native American religious use of peyote. If such use is permitted in the face of the congressional findings in § 812(b)(1) for hundreds of thousands of Native Americans practicing their faith, it is difficult to see how those same findings alone can preclude any consideration of a similar exception for the 130 or so American members of the UDV who want to practice theirs. See <i>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.</i> v. <i>Hialeah,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112881\"><a href=\"/opinion/112881/church-of-lukumi-babalu-aye-inc-v-hialeah/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span>, 547 (1993) (\"It is established in our strict scrutiny jurisprudence that `a law cannot be regarded as protecting an interest `of the highest order' ... when it leaves appreciable damage to that supposedly vital interest unprohibited'\" (quoting <i>Florida Star</i> v. <i>B.

Nothing about the unique political status of the Tribes makes their members immune from the health risks the Government asserts accompany any use of a Schedule I substance, nor insulates the Schedule I substance the Tribes use in religious exercise from the alleged risk of diversion.</p>\n<p>The Government argues that the existence of a <i>congressional</i> exemption for peyote does not indicate that the Controlled Substances Act is amenable to <i>judicially crafted</i> exceptions. RFRA, however, plainly contemplates that <i>courts</i> would recognize exceptionsthat is how the law works. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(c) (\"A person whose religious exercise has been burdened in violation of this section may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government\"). Congress' role in the peyote exemptionand the Executive's, see 21 CFR § 1307.31 (2005)confirms that the findings in the Controlled Substances Act do not preclude exceptions altogether; RFRA makes clear that it is the obligation of the courts to consider whether exceptions are required under the test set forth by Congress.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The well-established peyote exception also fatally undermines the Government's broader contention that the Controlled Substances Act establishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under RFRA. The Government argues that the effectiveness of the Controlled Substances Act will be \"necessarily . . . undercut\" if the Act is not uniformly applied, without regard to burdens on religious exercise. Brief for Petitioners 18. The peyote exception, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*435</span> however, has been in place since the outset of the Controlled Substances Act, and there is no evidence that it has \"undercut\" the Government's ability to enforce the ban on peyote use by non-Indians.</p>\n<p>The Government points to some pre-<i>Smith</i> cases relying on a need for uniformity in rejecting claims for religious exemptions under the Free Exercise Clause, see Brief for Petitioners 16, but those cases strike us as quite different from the present one. Those cases did not embrace the notion that a general interest in uniformity justified a substantial burden on religious exercise; they instead scrutinized the asserted need and explained why the denied exemptions could not be accommodated. In <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110647\"><a href=\"/opinion/110647/united-states-v-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span> (1982), for example, the Court rejected a claimed exception to the obligation to pay Social Security taxes, noting that \"mandatory participation is indispensable to the fiscal vitality of the social security system\" and that the \"tax system could not function if denominations were allowed to challenge the tax system because tax payments were spent in a manner that violates their religious belief.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 258, 260. See also <i>Hernandez</i> v. <i>Commissioner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112271\"><a href=\"/opinion/112271/hernandez-v-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">680</span></a></span>, 700 (1989) (same). In <i>Braunfeld</i> v. <i>Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106251\"><a href=\"/opinion/106251/braunfeld-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">599</span></a></span> (1961) (plurality opinion), the Court denied a claimed exception to Sunday closing laws, in part because allowing such exceptions \"might well provide [the claimants] with an economic Fadvantage over their competitors who must remain closed on that day.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 608-609. The whole point of a \"uniform day of rest for all workers\" would have been defeated by exceptions. See <i>Sherbert,</i> 374 U.S., at 408 (discussing <i>Braunfeld</i>). These cases show that the Government can demonstrate a compelling interest in uniform application of a particular program by offering evidence that granting the requested religious accommodations would seriously compromise its ability to administer the program.</p>\n<p>Here the Government's argument for uniformity is different; it rests not so much on the particular statutory program at issue as on slippery-slope concerns that could be invoked <span class=\"star-pagination\">*436</span> in response to any RFRA claim for an exception to a generally applicable law. The Government's argument echoes the classic rejoinder of bureaucrats throughout history: If I make an exception for you, I'll have to make one for everybody, so no exceptions. But RFRA operates by mandating consideration, under the compelling interest test, of exceptions to \"rule[s] of general applicability.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a). Congress determined that the legislated test \"is a workable test for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests.\" § 2000bb(a)(5). This determination finds support in our cases; in <i>Sherbert,</i> for example, we rejected a slippery-slope argument similar to the one offered in this case, dismissing as \"no more than a possibility\" the State's speculation \"that the filing of fraudulent claims by unscrupulous claimants feigning religious objections to Saturday work\" would drain the unemployment benefits fund. 374 U.S., at 407.</p>\n<p>We reaffirmed just last Term the feasibility of case-by-case consideration of religious exemptions to generally applicable rules. In <i>Cutter</i> v. <i>Wilkinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142900\"><a href=\"/opinion/142900/cutter-v-wilkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">709</span></a></span> (2005), we held that the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, which allows federal and state prisoners to seek religious accommodations pursuant to the same standard as set forth in RFRA, does not violate the Establishment Clause. We had \"no cause to believe\" that the compelling interest test \"would not be applied in an appropriately balanced way\" to specific claims for exemptions as they arose. <i>Id.,</i> at 722. Nothing in our opinion suggested that courts were not up to the task.</p>\n<p>We do not doubt that there may be instances in which a need for uniformity precludes the recognition of exceptions to generally applicable laws under RFRA. But it would have been surprising to find that this was such a case, given the longstanding exemption from the Controlled Substances Act for religious use of peyote, and the fact that the very reason Congress enacted RFRA was to respond to a decision <span class=\"star-pagination\">*437</span> denying a claimed right to sacramental use of a controlled substance. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb(a)(4). And in fact the Government has not offered evidence demonstrating that granting the UDV an exemption would cause the kind of administrative harm recognized as a compelling interest in <i>Lee, Hernandez,</i> and <i>Braunfeld.</i> The Government failed to convince the District Court at the preliminary injunction hearing that health or diversion concerns provide a compelling interest in banning the UDV's sacramental use of <i>hoasca.</i> It cannot compensate for that failure now with the bold argument that there can be no RFRA exceptions at all to the Controlled Substances Act. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 17 (Deputy Solicitor General statement that exception could not be made even for \"rigorously policed\" use of \"one drop\" of substance \"once a year\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Before the District Court, the Government also asserted an interest in compliance with the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances, Feb. 21, 1971, [1979-1980] 32 U.S. T. 543, T. I. A. S. No. 9725. The Convention, signed by the United States and implemented by the Controlled Substances Act, calls on signatories to prohibit the use of hallucinogens, including DMT. The Government argues that it has a compelling interest in meeting its international obligations by complying with the Convention.</p>\n<p>The District Court rejected this interest because it found that the Convention does not cover <i>hoasca.</i> The court relied on the official commentary to the Convention, which notes that \"Schedule I [of the Convention] does not list . . . natural hallucinogenic materials,\" and that \"[p]lants as such are not, andit is submittedare also not likely to be, listed in Schedule I, but only some products obtained from plants.\" U. N. Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances 387, 385 (1976). The court reasoned that <i>hoasca,</i> like the plants from which the tea is made, is sufficiently distinct from DMT itself to fall outside the treaty. See 282 F. Supp. 2d, at 1266-1269.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*438</span> We do not agree. The Convention provides that \"a preparation is subject to the same measures of control as the psychotropic substance which it contains,\" and defines \"preparation\" as \"any solution or mixture, in whatever physical state, containing one or more psychotropic substances.\" See 32 U.S. T., at 546, Art. 1(f)(i); <i>id.,</i> at 551, Art. 3. <i>Hoasca</i> is a \"solution or mixture\" containing DMT; the fact that it is made by the simple process of brewing plants in water, as opposed to some more advanced method, does not change that. To the extent the commentary suggests plants themselves are not covered by the Convention, that is of no momentthe UDV seeks to import and use a tea brewed from plants, not the plants themselves, and the tea plainly qualifies as a \"preparation\" under the Convention.</p>\n<p>The fact that <i>hoasca</i> is covered by the Convention, however, does not automatically mean that the Government has demonstrated a compelling interest in applying the Controlled Substances Act, which implements the Convention, to the UDV's sacramental use of the tea. At the present stage, it suffices to observe that the Government did not even <i>submit</i> evidence addressing the international consequences of granting an exemption for the UDV. The Government simply submitted two affidavits by State Department officials attesting to the general importance of honoring international obligations and of maintaining the leadership position of the United States in the international war on drugs. See Declaration of Gary T. Sheridan (Jan. 24, 2001), App. G to App. to Pet. for Cert. 261a; Declaration of Robert E. Dalton (Jan. 24, 2001), App. H, <i>id.,</i> at 265a. We do not doubt the validity of these interests, any more than we doubt the general interest in promoting public health and safety by enforcing the Controlled Substances Act, but under RFRA invocation of such general interests, standing alone, is not enough.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*439</span> * * *</h2>\n<p>The Government repeatedly invokes Congress' findings and purposes underlying the Controlled Substances Act, but Congress had a reason for enacting RFRA, too. Congress recognized that \"laws `neutral' toward religion may burden religious exercise as surely as laws intended to interfere with religious exercise,\" and legislated \"the compelling interest test\" as the means for the courts to \"strik[e] sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests.\" 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb(a)(2), (5).</p>\n<p>We have no cause to pretend that the task assigned by Congress to the courts under RFRA is an easy one. Indeed, the very sort of difficulties highlighted by the Government here were cited by this Court in deciding that the approach later mandated by Congress under RFRA was not required as a matter of constitutional law under the Free Exercise Clause. See <i>Smith,</i> 494 U.S., at 885-890. But Congress has determined that courts should strike sensible balances, pursuant to a compelling interest test that requires the Government to address the particular practice at issue. Applying that test, we conclude that the courts below did not err in determining that the Government failed to demonstrate, at the preliminary injunction stage, a compelling interest in barring the UDV's sacramental use of <i>hoasca.</i></p>\n<p>The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is affirmed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  <i>Marci A.

Argued November 1, 2005—Decided February 21, 2006\nCongress enacted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993\n  (RFRA) in response to Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of\n  Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872, where, in upholding a generally appli-\n  cable law that burdened the sacramental use of peyote, this Court\n  held that the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause does not re-\n  quire judges to engage in a case-by-case assessment of the religious\n  burdens imposed by facially constitutional laws, id., at 883–890.\n  Among other things, RFRA prohibits the Federal Government from\n  substantially burdening a person’s exercise of religion, “even if the\n  burden results from a rule of general applicability,” 42 U. S. C.\n  §2000bb–1(a), except when the Government can “demonstrat[e] that\n  application of the burden to the person (1) [furthers] a compelling\n  government interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of further-\n  ing that . . . interest,” §2000bb–1(b).\n     Members of respondent church (UDV) receive communion by drink-\n  ing hoasca, a tea brewed from plants unique to the Amazon Rainfor-\n  est that contains DMT, a hallucinogen regulated under Schedule I of\n  the Controlled Substances Act, see 21 U. S. C. §812(c), Schedule I(c).\n  After U. S. Customs inspectors seized a hoasca shipment to the\n  American UDV and threatened prosecution, the UDV filed this suit\n  for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging, inter alia, that apply-\n  ing the Controlled Substances Act to the UDV’s sacramental hoasca\n  use violates RFRA. At a hearing on the UDV’s preliminary injunc-\n  tion motion, the Government conceded that the challenged applica-\n  tion would substantially burden a sincere exercise of religion, but ar-\n  gued that this burden did not violate RFRA because applying the\n2        GONZALES v. O CENTRO ESPIRITA BENEFICENTE\n                      UNIAO DO VEGETAL\n                           Syllabus\n\n    Controlled Substances Act was the least restrictive means of advanc-\n    ing three compelling governmental interests: protecting UDV mem-\n    bers’ health and safety, preventing the diversion of hoasca from the\n    church to recreational users, and complying with the 1971 United\n    Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The District Court\n    granted relief, concluding that, because the parties’ evidence on\n    health risks and diversion was equally balanced, the Government\n    had failed to demonstrate a compelling interest justifying the sub-\n    stantial burden on the UDV. The court also held that the 1971 Con-\n    vention does not apply to hoasca. The Tenth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The courts below did not err in determining that the Government\n failed to demonstrate, at the preliminary injunction stage, a compel-\n ling interest in barring the UDV’s sacramental use of hoasca. Pp. 6–\n 19.\n    1. This Court rejects the Government’s argument that evidentiary\n equipoise as to potential harm and diversion is an insufficient basis\n for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Controlled\n Substances Act. Given that the Government conceded the UDV’s\n prima facie RFRA case in the District Court and that the evidence\n found to be in equipoise related to an affirmative defense as to which\n the Government bore the burden of proof, the UDV effectively dem-\n onstrated a likelihood of success on the merits. The Government’s\n argument that, although it would bear the burden of demonstrating a\n compelling interest at trial on the merits, the UDV should have borne\n the burden of disproving such interests at the preliminary injunction\n hearing is foreclosed by Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union,\n 542 U. S. 656, 666. There, in affirming the grant of a preliminary in-\n junction against the Government, this Court reasoned that the bur-\n dens with respect to the compelling interest test at the preliminary\n injunction stage track the burdens at trial. The Government’s at-\n tempt to limit the Ashcroft rule to content-based restrictions on\n speech is unavailing. The fact that Ashcroft involved such a restric-\n tion in no way affected the Court’s assessment of the consequences of\n having the burden at trial for preliminary injunction purposes. Con-\n gress’ express decision to legislate the compelling interest test indi-\n cates that RFRA challenges should be adjudicated in the same way\n as the test’s constitutionally mandated applications, including at the\n preliminary injunction stage. Pp. 6–8.\n    2. Also rejected is the Government’s central submission that, be-\n cause it has a compelling interest in the uniform application of the\n Controlled Substances Act, no exception to the DMT ban can be made\n to accommodate the UDV. The Government argues, inter alia, that\n the Act’s description of Schedule I substances as having “a high po-\n tential for abuse,” “no currently accepted medical use,” and “a lack of\n                   Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\naccepted safety for use . . . under medical supervision,” 21 U. S. C.\n§812(b)(1), by itself precludes any consideration of individualized ex-\nceptions, and that the Act’s “closed” regulatory system, which prohib-\nits all use of controlled substances except as the Act itself authorizes,\nsee Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. ___, ___, cannot function properly if\nsubjected to judicial exemptions. Pp. 8–16.\n     (a) RFRA and its strict scrutiny test contemplate an inquiry\nmore focused than the Government’s categorical approach. RFRA re-\nquires the Government to demonstrate that the compelling interest\ntest is satisfied through application of the challenged law “to the per-\nson”—the particular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is be-\ning substantially burdened. 42 U. S. C. §2000bb–1(b). Section\n2000bb(b)(1) expressly adopted the compelling interest test of Sher-\nbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398, and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205.\nThere, the Court looked beyond broadly formulated interests justify-\ning the general applicability of government mandates, scrutinized the\nasserted harms, and granted specific exemptions to particular reli-\ngious claimants. Id., at 213, 221, 236; Sherbert, supra, at 410. Out-\nside the Free Exercise area as well, the Court has noted that\n“[c]ontext matters” in applying the compelling interest test, Grutter v.\nBollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 327, and has emphasized that strict scrutiny’s\nfundamental purpose is to take “relevant differences” into account,\nAdarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 228. Pp. 9–10.\n     (b) Under RFRA’s more focused inquiry, the Government’s mere\ninvocation of the general characteristics of Schedule I substances\ncannot carry the day. Although Schedule I substances such as DMT\nare exceptionally dangerous, see, e.g., Touby v. United States, 500\nU. S. 160, 162, there is no indication that Congress, in classifying\nDMT, considered the harms posed by the particular use at issue.\nThat question was litigated below. Before the District Court found\nthat the Government had not carried its burden of showing a compel-\nling interest in preventing such harm, the court noted that it could\nnot ignore the congressional classification and findings. But Con-\ngress’ determination that DMT should be listed under Schedule I\nsimply does not provide a categorical answer that relieves the Gov-\nernment of the obligation to shoulder its RFRA burden. The Con-\ntrolled Substances Act’s authorization to the Attorney General to\n“waive the requirement for registration of certain manufacturers, dis-\ntributors, or dispensers if he finds it consistent with the public health\nand safety,” 21 U. S. C. §822(d), reinforces that Congress’ findings\nwith respect to Schedule I substances should not carry the determi-\nnative weight, for RFRA purposes, that the Government would as-\ncribe to them. Indeed, despite the fact that everything the Govern-\nment says about the DMT in hoasca applies in equal measure to the\n4         GONZALES v. O CENTRO ESPIRITA BENEFICENTE\n                       UNIAO DO VEGETAL\n                            Syllabus\n\n    mescaline in peyote, another Schedule I substance, both the Execu-\n    tive and Congress have decreed an exception from the Controlled\n    Substances Act for Native American religious use of peyote, see 21\n    CFR §1307.31; 42 U. S. C. §1996a(b)(1). If such use is permitted in\n    the face of the general congressional findings for hundreds of thou-\n    sands of Native Americans practicing their faith, those same findings\n    alone cannot preclude consideration of a similar exception for the 130\n    or so American members of the UDV who want to practice theirs.\n    See Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 547.\n    The Government’s argument that the existence of a congressional ex-\n    emption for peyote does not indicate that the Controlled Substances Act\n    is amenable to judicially crafted exceptions fails because RFRA plainly\n    contemplates court-recognized exceptions, see §2000bb–1(c). Pp. 11–13.\n         (c) The peyote exception also fatally undermines the Govern-\n    ment’s broader contention that the Controlled Substances Act estab-\n    lishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under\n    RFRA. The peyote exception has been in place since the Controlled\n    Substances Act’s outset, and there is no evidence that it has undercut\n    the Government’s ability to enforce the ban on peyote use by non-\n    Indians. The Government’s reliance on pre-Smith cases asserting a\n    need for uniformity in rejecting claims for religious exemptions under\n    the Free Exercise Clause is unavailing. Those cases did not embrace\n    the notion that a general interest in uniformity justified a substantial\n    burden on religious exercise, but instead scrutinized the asserted\n    need and explained why the denied exemptions could not be accom-\n    modated. See, e.g., United States v. Lee, 455 U. S. 252, 258, 260.\n    They show that the Government can demonstrate a compelling inter-\n    est in uniform application of a particular program by offering evi-\n    dence that granting the requested religious accommodations would\n    seriously compromise its ability to administer the program. Here the\n    Government’s uniformity argument rests not so much on the particu-\n    lar statutory program at issue as on slippery slope concerns that\n    could be invoked in response to any RFRA claim for an exception to a\n    generally applicable law, i.e., “if I make an exception for you, I’ll have\n    to make one for everybody, so no exceptions.” But RFRA operates by\n    mandating consideration, under the compelling interest test, of ex-\n    ceptions to “rule[s] of general applicability.” §2000bb–1(a). Congress’\n    determination that the legislated test is “workable . . . for striking\n    sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior gov-\n    ernmental interests,” §200bb(a)(5), finds support in Sherbert, supra,\n    at 407, and Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. ___, ___. While there may\n    be instances where a need for uniformity precludes the recognition of\n    exceptions to generally applicable laws under RFRA, it would be sur-\n    prising to find that this was such a case, given the longstanding pe-\n                     Cite as: 546 U.

The Government has not\n  shown that granting the UDV an exemption would cause the kind of\n  administrative harm recognized as a compelling interest in, e.g., Lee.\n  It cannot now compensate for its failure to convince the District\n  Court as to its health or diversion concerns with the bold argument\n  that there can be no RFRA exceptions at all to the Controlled Sub-\n  stances Act. Pp. 13–16.\n    3. The Government argues unpersuasively that it has a compelling\n  interest in complying with the 1971 U. N. Convention. While this\n  Court does not agree with the District Court that the Convention\n  does not cover hoasca, that does not automatically mean that the\n  Government has demonstrated a compelling interest in applying the\n  Controlled Substances Act, which implements the Convention, to the\n  UDV’s sacramental use. At this stage, it suffices that the Govern-\n  ment did not submit any evidence addressing the international con-\n  sequences of granting the UDV an exemption, but simply relied on\n  two affidavits by State Department officials attesting to the general\n  (and undoubted) importance of honoring international obligations\n  and maintaining the United States’ leadership in the international\n  war on drugs.

The Government con-\ncedes that this practice is a sincere exercise of religion, but\nnonetheless sought to prohibit the small American branch\nof the sect from engaging in the practice, on the ground\nthat the Controlled Substances Act bars all use of the\nhallucinogen. The sect sued to block enforcement against\nit of the ban on the sacramental tea, and moved for a\npreliminary injunction.\n   It relied on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of\n1993, which prohibits the Federal Government from sub-\nstantially burdening a person’s exercise of religion, unless\nthe Government “demonstrates that application of the\nburden to the person” represents the least restrictive\nmeans of advancing a compelling interest. 42 U.

The District Court granted the preliminary\ninjunction, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.           We\ngranted the Government’s petition for certiorari. Before\nthis Court, the Government’s central submission is that it\nhas a compelling interest in the uniform application of the\nControlled Substances Act, such that no exception to the\nban on use of the hallucinogen can be made to accommo-\ndate the sect’s sincere religious practice. We conclude that\nthe Government has not carried the burden expressly\nplaced on it by Congress in the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act, and affirm the grant of the preliminary\ninjunction.\n                              I\n   In Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore.\nv. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990), this Court held that the\nFree Exercise Clause of the First Amendment does not\nprohibit governments from burdening religious practices\nthrough generally applicable laws. In Smith, we rejected\na challenge to an Oregon statute that denied unemploy-\nment benefits to drug users, including Native Americans\nengaged in the sacramental use of peyote. Id., at 890. In\nso doing, we rejected the interpretation of the Free Exer-\ncise Clause announced in Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398\n(1963), and, in accord with earlier cases, see Smith, 494\nU. S., at 879–880, 884–885, held that the Constitution\ndoes not require judges to engage in a case-by-case as-\nsessment of the religious burdens imposed by facially\nconstitutional laws. Id., at 883–890.\n   Congress responded by enacting the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 107 Stat. 1488, as\namended, 42 U. S. C. §2000bb et seq., which adopts a\nstatutory rule comparable to the constitutional rule re-\njected in Smith. Under RFRA, the Federal Government\nmay not, as a statutory matter, substantially burden a\nperson’s exercise of religion, “even if the burden results\n                    Cite as: 546 U.

The\nonly exception recognized by the statute requires the\nGovernment to satisfy the compelling interest test—to\n“demonstrat[e] that application of the burden to the per-\nson—(1) is in furtherance of a compelling government\ninterest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of further-\ning that compelling governmental interest.” §2000bb–1(b).\nA person whose religious practices are burdened in viola-\ntion of RFRA “may assert that violation as a claim or\ndefense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate\nrelief.” §2000bb–1(c).1\n   The Controlled Substances Act, 84 Stat. 1242, as\namended, 21 U. S. C. §801 et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. I),\nregulates the importation, manufacture, distribution, and\nuse of psychotropic substances. The Act classifies sub-\nstances into five schedules based on their potential for\nabuse, the extent to which they have an accepted medical\nuse, and their safety. See §812(b) (2000 ed.). Substances\nlisted in Schedule I of the Act are subject to the most\ncomprehensive restrictions, including an outright ban on\nall importation and use, except pursuant to strictly regu-\nlated research projects. See §§823, 960(a)(1). The Act\nauthorizes the imposition of a criminal sentence for simple\npossession of Schedule I substances, see §844(a), and\nmandates the imposition of a criminal sentence for posses-\nsion “with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense”\nsuch substances, see §§841(a), (b).\n   O Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal (UDV)\nis a Christian Spiritist sect based in Brazil, with an\nAmerican branch of approximately 130 individuals.

One of the\nplants, psychotria viridis, contains dimethyltryptamine\n(DMT), a hallucinogen whose effects are enhanced by\nalkaloids from the other plant, banisteriopsis caapi. DMT,\nas well as “any material, compound, mixture, or prepara-\ntion, which contains any quantity of [DMT],” is listed in\nSchedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. §812(c),\nSchedule I(c).\n   In 1999, United States Customs inspectors intercepted a\nshipment to the American UDV containing three drums of\nhoasca. A subsequent investigation revealed that the\nUDV had received 14 prior shipments of hoasca. The\ninspectors seized the intercepted shipment and threatened\nthe UDV with prosecution.\n   The UDV filed suit against the Attorney General and\nother federal law enforcement officials, seeking declara-\ntory and injunctive relief. The complaint alleged, inter\nalia, that applying the Controlled Substances Act to the\nUDV’s sacramental use of hoasca violates RFRA. Prior to\ntrial, the UDV moved for a preliminary injunction, so that\nit could continue to practice its faith pending trial on the\nmerits.\n   At a hearing on the preliminary injunction, the Gov-\nernment conceded that the challenged application of the\nControlled Substances Act would substantially burden a\nsincere exercise of religion by the UDV. See O Centro\nEspirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal v. Ashcroft, 282\nF. Supp. 2d 1236, 1252 (NM 2002). The Government\nargued, however, that this burden did not violate RFRA,\nbecause applying the Controlled Substances Act in this\ncase was the least restrictive means of advancing three\ncompelling governmental interests: protecting the health\nand safety of UDV members, preventing the diversion of\nhoasca from the church to recreational users, and comply-\ning with the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psycho-\n                  Cite as: 546 U.

S. T. 543, T. I. A. S. No. 9725. See 282 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 1252–1253.\n   The District Court heard evidence from both parties on\nthe health risks of hoasca and the potential for diversion\nfrom the church. The Government presented evidence to\nthe effect that use of hoasca, or DMT more generally, can\ncause psychotic reactions, cardiac irregularities, and\nadverse drug interactions. The UDV countered by citing\nstudies documenting the safety of its sacramental use of\nhoasca and presenting evidence that minimized the likeli-\nhood of the health risks raised by the Government. With\nrespect to diversion, the Government pointed to a general\nrise in the illicit use of hallucinogens, and cited interest in\nthe illegal use of DMT and hoasca in particular; the UDV\nemphasized the thinness of any market for hoasca, the\nrelatively small amounts of the substance imported by the\nchurch, and the absence of any diversion problem in the\npast.\n   The District Court concluded that the evidence on\nhealth risks was “in equipoise,” and similarly that the\nevidence on diversion was “virtually balanced.” Id., at\n1262, 1266. In the face of such an even showing, the court\nreasoned that the Government had failed to demonstrate a\ncompelling interest justifying what it acknowledged was a\nsubstantial burden on the UDV’s sincere religious exer-\ncise. Id., at 1255. The court also rejected the asserted\ninterest in complying with the 1971 Convention on Psy-\nchotropic Substances, holding that the Convention does\nnot apply to hoasca. Id., at 1266–1269.\n   The court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting\nthe Government from enforcing the Controlled Substances\nAct with respect to the UDV’s importation and use of\nhoasca. The injunction requires the church to import the\ntea pursuant to federal permits, to restrict control over the\n6      GONZALES v.

The\ninjunction also provides that “if [the Government] be-\nlieve[s] that evidence exists that hoasca has negatively\naffected the health of UDV members,” or “that a shipment\nof hoasca contain[s] particularly dangerous levels of DMT,\n[the Government] may apply to the Court for an expedited\ndetermination of whether the evidence warrants suspen-\nsion or revocation of [the UDV’s authority to use hoasca].”\nId., at 257a, ¶29.\n   The Government appealed the preliminary injunction\nand a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\naffirmed, O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal\nv. Ashcroft, 342 F. 3d 1170 (2003), as did a majority of the\nCircuit sitting en banc, 389 F. 3d 973 (2004). We granted\ncertiorari. 544 U. S. 973 (2005).\n                              II\n   Although its briefs contain some discussion of the poten-\ntial for harm and diversion from the UDV’s use of hoasca,\nthe Government does not challenge the District Court’s\nfactual findings or its conclusion that the evidence submit-\nted on these issues was evenly balanced. Instead, the\nGovernment maintains that such evidentiary equipoise is\nan insufficient basis for issuing a preliminary injunction\nagainst enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act. We\nreview the District Court’s legal rulings de novo and its\nultimate decision to issue the preliminary injunction for\nabuse of discretion. See McCreary County v. American\nCivil Liberties Union, 545 U. S. ___ , ___ (2005) (slip op., at\n19).\n   The Government begins by invoking the well-\nestablished principle that the party seeking pretrial relief\nbears the burden of demonstrating a likelihood of success\n                 Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\non the merits. See, e.g., Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U. S.\n968, 972 (1997) (per curiam); Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422\nU. S. 922, 931 (1975). The Government argues that the\nDistrict Court lost sight of this principle in issuing the\ninjunction based on a mere tie in the evidentiary record.\n   A majority of the en banc Court of Appeals rejected this\nargument, and so do we. Before the District Court, the\nGovernment conceded the UDV’s prima facie case under\nRFRA. See 282 F. Supp. 2d, at 1252 (application of the\nControlled Substances Act would (1) substantially burden\n(2) a sincere (3) religious exercise). The evidence the\nDistrict Court found to be in equipoise related to two of\nthe compelling interests asserted by the Government,\nwhich formed part of the Government’s affirmative de-\nfense. See 42 U. S. C. §2000bb–1(b) (“Government may\nsubstantially burden a person’s exercise of religion only if\nit demonstrates that application of the burden to the per-\nson—(1) is in furtherance of a compelling government\ninterest . . .” (emphasis added)); §2000bb–2(3) (“[T]he term\n‘demonstrates’ means meets the burdens of going forward\nwith the evidence and of persuasion”). Accordingly, the\nUDV effectively demonstrated that its sincere exercise of\nreligion was substantially burdened, and the Government\nfailed to demonstrate that the application of the burden to\nthe UDV would, more likely than not, be justified by the\nasserted compelling interests. See 389 F. 3d, at 1009\n(Seymour, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n(“[T]he balance is between actual irreparable harm to [the]\nplaintiff and potential harm to the government which\ndoes not even rise to the level of a preponderance of the\nevidence”).\n   The Government argues that, although it would bear\nthe burden of demonstrating a compelling interest as part\nof its affirmative defense at trial on the merits, the UDV\nshould have borne the burden of disproving the asserted\ncompelling interests at the hearing on the preliminary\n8       GONZALES v. O CENTRO ESPIRITA BENEFICENTE\n                     UNIAO DO VEGETAL\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninjunction. This argument is foreclosed by our recent\ndecision in Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 542\nU. S. 656 (2004). In Ashcroft, we affirmed the grant of a\npreliminary injunction in a case where the Government\nhad failed to show a likelihood of success under the com-\npelling interest test. We reasoned that “[a]s the Govern-\nment bears the burden of proof on the ultimate question of\n[the challenged Act’s] constitutionality, respondents [the\nmovants] must be deemed likely to prevail unless the\nGovernment has shown that respondents’ proposed less\nrestrictive alternatives are less effective than [enforcing\nthe Act].” Id., at 666. That logic extends to this case; here\nthe Government failed on the first prong of the compelling\ninterest test, and did not reach the least restrictive means\nprong, but that can make no difference. The point re-\nmains that the burdens at the preliminary injunction\nstage track the burdens at trial.\n   The Government attempts to limit the rule announced\nin Ashcroft to content-based restrictions on speech, but the\ndistinction is unavailing. The fact that Ashcroft involved\nsuch a restriction was the reason the Government had the\nburden of proof at trial under the First Amendment, see\nid., at 665, but in no way affected the Court’s assessment\nof the consequences of having that burden for purposes of\nthe preliminary injunction. Here the burden is placed\nsquarely on the Government by RFRA rather than the\nFirst Amendment, see 42 U. S. C. §§2000bb–1(b), 2000bb–\n2(3), but the consequences are the same. Congress’ ex-\npress decision to legislate the compelling interest test\nindicates that RFRA challenges should be adjudicated in\nthe same manner as constitutionally mandated applica-\ntions of the test, including at the preliminary injunction\nstage.\n                           III\n    The Government’s second line of argument rests on the\n                 Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nControlled Substances Act itself. The Government con-\ntends that the Act’s description of Schedule I substances\nas having “a high potential for abuse,” “no currently ac-\ncepted medical use in treatment in the United States,” and\n“a lack of accepted safety for use . . . under medical super-\nvision,” 21 U. S. C. §812(b)(1), by itself precludes any\nconsideration of individualized exceptions such as that\nsought by the UDV. The Government goes on to argue\nthat the regulatory regime established by the Act—a\n“closed” system that prohibits all use of controlled sub-\nstances except as authorized by the Act itself, see Gonzales\nv. Raich, 545 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 10)—“cannot\nfunction with its necessary rigor and comprehensiveness if\nsubjected to judicial exemptions.” Brief for Petitioners 18.\nAccording to the Government, there would be no way to\ncabin religious exceptions once recognized, and “the public\nwill misread” such exceptions as signaling that the sub-\nstance at issue is not harmful after all. Id., at 23. Under\nthe Government’s view, there is no need to assess the\nparticulars of the UDV’s use or weigh the impact of an\nexemption for that specific use, because the Controlled\nSubstances Act serves a compelling purpose and simply\nadmits of no exceptions.\n                              A\n  RFRA, and the strict scrutiny test it adopted, contem-\nplate an inquiry more focused than the Government’s\ncategorical approach. RFRA requires the Government to\ndemonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied\nthrough application of the challenged law “to the per-\nson”—the particular claimant whose sincere exercise of\nreligion is being substantially burdened. 42 U. S. C.\n§2000bb–1(b). RFRA expressly adopted the compelling\ninterest test “as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S.\n398 (1963) and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205 (1972).”\n42 U. S. C. §2000bb(b)(1). In each of those cases, this\n10     GONZALES v. O CENTRO ESPIRITA BENEFICENTE\n                    UNIAO DO VEGETAL\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt looked beyond broadly formulated interests justify-\ning the general applicability of government mandates and\nscrutinized the asserted harm of granting specific exemp-\ntions to particular religious claimants. In Yoder, for ex-\nample, we permitted an exemption for Amish children\nfrom a compulsory school attendance law. We recognized\nthat the State had a “paramount” interest in education,\nbut held that “despite its admitted validity in the general-\nity of cases, we must searchingly examine the interests\nthat the State seeks to promote . . . and the impediment to\nthose objectives that would flow from recognizing the\nclaimed Amish exemption.” 406 U. S., at 213, 221 (empha-\nsis added). The Court explained that the State needed “to\nshow with more particularity how its admittedly strong\ninterest . . . would be adversely affected by granting an\nexemption to the Amish.” Id., at 236 (emphasis added).\n   In Sherbert, the Court upheld a particular claim to a\nreligious exemption from a state law denying unemploy-\nment benefits to those who would not work on Saturdays,\nbut explained that it was not announcing a constitutional\nright to unemployment benefits for “all persons whose\nreligious convictions are the cause of their unemploy-\nment.” 374 U. S., at 410 (emphasis added). The Court\ndistinguished the case “in which an employee’s religious\nconvictions serve to make him a nonproductive member of\nsociety.”     Ibid.; see also Smith, 494 U. S., at 899\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (strict scrutiny “at\nleast requires a case-by-case determination of the ques-\ntion, sensitive to the facts of each particular claim”).\nOutside the Free Exercise area as well, the Court has\nnoted that “[c]ontext matters” in applying the compelling\ninterest test, Grutter v.

It is true, of course, that Schedule I\nsubstances such as DMT are exceptionally dangerous.\nSee, e.g., Touby v. United States, 500 U. S. 160, 162 (1991).\nNevertheless, there is no indication that Congress, in classi-\nfying DMT, considered the harms posed by the particular\nuse at issue here—the circumscribed, sacramental use of\nhoasca by the UDV. The question of the harms from the\nsacramental use of hoasca by the UDV was litigated be-\nlow. Before the District Court found that the Government\nhad not carried its burden of showing a compelling inter-\nest in preventing such harms, the court noted that it could\nnot “ignore that the legislative branch of the government\nelected to place materials containing DMT on Schedule I\nof the [Act], reflecting findings that substances containing\nDMT have ‘a high potential for abuse,’ and ‘no currently\naccepted medical use in treatment in the United States,’\nand that ‘[t]here is a lack of accepted safety for use of\n[DMT] under medical supervision.’ ” 282 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1254. But Congress’ determination that DMT should be\nlisted under Schedule I simply does not provide a categori-\ncal answer that relieves the Government of the obligation\nto shoulder its burden under RFRA.\n   This conclusion is reinforced by the Controlled Sub-\nstances Act itself. The Act contains a provision authoriz-\ning the Attorney General to “waive the requirement for\nregistration of certain manufacturers, distributors, or\ndispensers if he finds it consistent with the public health\nand safety.” 21 U. S. C. §822(d). The fact that the Act\nitself contemplates that exempting certain people from its\nrequirements would be “consistent with the public health\nand safety” indicates that congressional findings with\n12     GONZALES v. O CENTRO ESPIRITA BENEFICENTE\n                    UNIAO DO VEGETAL\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrespect to Schedule I substances should not carry the\ndeterminative weight, for RFRA purposes, that the Gov-\nernment would ascribe to them.\n   And in fact an exception has been made to the Schedule\nI ban for religious use. For the past 35 years, there has\nbeen a regulatory exemption for use of peyote—a Schedule\nI substance—by the Native American Church. See 21\nCFR §1307.31 (2005). In 1994, Congress extended that\nexemption to all members of every recognized Indian\nTribe. See 42 U. S. C. §1996a(b)(1). Everything the Gov-\nernment says about the DMT in hoasca—that, as a Sched-\nule I substance, Congress has determined that it “has a\nhigh potential for abuse,” “has no currently accepted medi-\ncal use,” and has “a lack of accepted safety for use . . .\nunder medical supervision,” 21 U. S. C. §812(b)(1)—\napplies in equal measure to the mescaline in peyote, yet\nboth the Executive and Congress itself have decreed an\nexception from the Controlled Substances Act for Native\nAmerican religious use of peyote. If such use is permitted\nin the face of the congressional findings in §812(b)(1) for\nhundreds of thousands of Native Americans practicing\ntheir faith, it is difficult to see how those same findings\nalone can preclude any consideration of a similar excep-\ntion for the 130 or so American members of the UDV who\nwant to practice theirs. See Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye,\nInc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 547 (1993) (“It is established\nin our strict scrutiny jurisprudence that ‘a law cannot be\nregarded as protecting an interest ‘of the highest order’ . . .\nwhen it leaves appreciable damage to that supposedly\nvital interest unprohibited’ ” (quoting Florida Star v.\nB. J. F., 491 U. S. 524, 541–542 (1989) (SCALIA, J., concur-\nring in part and concurring in judgment))).\n   The Government responds that there is a “unique rela-\ntionship” between the United States and the Tribes, Brief\nfor Petitioners 27; see Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535\n(1974), but never explains what about that “unique” rela-\n                  Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntionship justifies overriding the same congressional findings\non which the Government relies in resisting any exception\nfor the UDV’s religious use of hoasca. In other words, if any\nSchedule I substance is in fact always highly dangerous in\nany amount no matter how used, what about the unique\nrelationship with the Tribes justifies allowing their use of\npeyote? Nothing about the unique political status of the\nTribes makes their members immune from the health risks\nthe Government asserts accompany any use of a Schedule I\nsubstance, nor insulates the Schedule I substance the Tribes\nuse in religious exercise from the alleged risk of diversion.\n   The Government argues that the existence of a congres-\nsional exemption for peyote does not indicate that the Con-\ntrolled Substances Act is amenable to judicially crafted\nexceptions. RFRA, however, plainly contemplates that\ncourts would recognize exceptions—that is how the law\nworks. See 42 U. S. C. §2000bb–1(c) (“A person whose\nreligious exercise has been burdened in violation of this\nsection may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a\njudicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a\ngovernment”). Congress’ role in the peyote exemption—and\nthe Executive’s, see 21 CFR §1307.31 (2005)—confirms that\nthe findings in the Controlled Substances Act do not pre-\nclude exceptions altogether; RFRA makes clear that it is the\nobligation of the courts to consider whether exceptions are\nrequired under the test set forth by Congress.\n                             C\n  The well-established peyote exception also fatally un-\ndermines the Government’s broader contention that the\nControlled Substances Act establishes a closed regulatory\nsystem that admits of no exceptions under RFRA. The\nGovernment argues that the effectiveness of the Con-\ntrolled Substances Act will be “necessarily . . . undercut” if\nthe Act is not uniformly applied, without regard to bur-\ndens on religious exercise. Brief for Petitioners 18. The\n14    GONZALES v. O CENTRO ESPIRITA BENEFICENTE\n                   UNIAO DO VEGETAL\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\npeyote exception, however, has been in place since the\noutset of the Controlled Substances Act, and there is no\nevidence that it has “undercut” the Government’s ability\nto enforce the ban on peyote use by non-Indians.\n   The Government points to some pre-Smith cases relying\non a need for uniformity in rejecting claims for religious\nexemptions under the Free Exercise Clause, see Brief for\nPetitioners 16, but those cases strike us as quite different\nfrom the present one. Those cases did not embrace the\nnotion that a general interest in uniformity justified a\nsubstantial burden on religious exercise; they instead\nscrutinized the asserted need and explained why the\ndenied exemptions could not be accommodated. In United\nStates v. Lee, 455 U. S. 252 (1982), for example, the Court\nrejected a claimed exception to the obligation to pay Social\nSecurity taxes, noting that “mandatory participation is\nindispensable to the fiscal vitality of the social security\nsystem” and that the “tax system could not function if de-\nnominations were allowed to challenge the tax system\nbecause tax payments were spent in a manner that violates\ntheir religious belief.” Id., at 258, 260. See also Hernandez\nv. Commissioner, 490 U. S. 680, 700 (1989) (same). In\nBraunfeld v. Brown, 366 U. S. 599 (1961) (plurality opinion),\nthe Court denied a claimed exception to Sunday closing\nlaws, in part because allowing such exceptions “might well\nprovide [the claimants] with an economic advantage over\ntheir competitors who must remain closed on that day.” Id.,\nat 608–609. The whole point of a “uniform day of rest for all\nworkers” would have been defeated by exceptions. See\nSherbert, 374 U. S., at 408 (discussing Braunfeld). These\ncases show that the Government can demonstrate a compel-\nling interest in uniform application of a particular program\nby offering evidence that granting the requested religious\naccommodations would seriously compromise its ability to\nadminister the program.\n   Here the Government’s argument for uniformity is differ-\n                 Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nent; it rests not so much on the particular statutory program\nat issue as on slippery-slope concerns that could be invoked\nin response to any RFRA claim for an exception to a gener-\nally applicable law. The Government’s argument echoes the\nclassic rejoinder of bureaucrats throughout history: If I\nmake an exception for you, I’ll have to make one for every-\nbody, so no exceptions. But RFRA operates by mandating\nconsideration, under the compelling interest test, of excep-\ntions to “rule[s] of general applicability.” 42 U. S. C.\n§2000bb–1(a). Congress determined that the legislated test\n“is a workable test for striking sensible balances between\nreligious liberty and competing prior governmental inter-\nests.” §200bb(a)(5). This determination finds support in our\ncases; in Sherbert, for example, we rejected a slippery-\nslope argument similar to the one offered in this case,\ndismissing as “no more than a possibility” the State’s\nspeculation “that the filing of fraudulent claims by un-\nscrupulous claimants feigning religious objections to Sat-\nurday work” would drain the unemployment benefits fund.\n374 U. S., at 407.\n   We reaffirmed just last Term the feasibility of case-by-\ncase consideration of religious exemptions to generally\napplicable rules. In Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. ___\n(2005), we held that the Religious Land Use and Institu-\ntionalized Persons Act of 2000, which allows federal and\nstate prisoners to seek religious accommodations pursuant\nto the same standard as set forth in RFRA, does not vio-\nlate the Establishment Clause. We had “no cause to be-\nlieve” that the compelling interest test “would not be\napplied in an appropriately balanced way” to specific\nclaims for exemptions as they arose. Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12). Nothing in our opinion suggested that courts were\nnot up to the task.\n   We do not doubt that there may be instances in which a\nneed for uniformity precludes the recognition of exceptions\nto generally applicable laws under RFRA. But it would\n16     GONZALES v. O CENTRO ESPIRITA BENEFICENTE\n                    UNIAO DO VEGETAL\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhave been surprising to find that this was such a case,\ngiven the longstanding exemption from the Controlled\nSubstances Act for religious use of peyote, and the fact\nthat the very reason Congress enacted RFRA was to re-\nspond to a decision denying a claimed right to sacramental\nuse of a controlled substance.           See 42 U. S. C.\n§2000bb(a)(4). And in fact the Government has not offered\nevidence demonstrating that granting the UDV an exemp-\ntion would cause the kind of administrative harm recog-\nnized as a compelling interest in Lee, Hernandez, and\nBraunfeld. The Government failed to convince the District\nCourt at the preliminary injunction hearing that health or\ndiversion concerns provide a compelling interest in ban-\nning the UDV’s sacramental use of hoasca. It cannot\ncompensate for that failure now with the bold argument\nthat there can be no RFRA exceptions at all to the Con-\ntrolled Substances Act. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 17 (Deputy\nSolicitor General statement that exception could not be\nmade even for “rigorously policed” use of “one drop” of\nsubstance “once a year”).\n                             IV\n  Before the District Court, the Government also asserted\nan interest in compliance with the 1971 United Nations\nConvention on Psychotropic Substances, Feb. 21, 1971,\n[1979–1980], 32 U. S. T. 543, T. I. A. S. No. 9725. The\nConvention, signed by the United States and implemented\nby the Controlled Substances Act, calls on signatories to\nprohibit the use of hallucinogens, including DMT. The\nGovernment argues that it has a compelling interest in\nmeeting its international obligations by complying with\nthe Convention.\n  The District Court rejected this interest because it found\nthat the Convention does not cover hoasca. The court\nrelied on the official commentary to the Convention, which\nnotes that “Schedule I [of the Convention] does not list . . .\n                 Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnatural hallucinogenic materials,” and that “[p]lants as\nsuch are not, and it is submitted are also not likely to be,\nlisted in Schedule I, but only some products obtained from\nplants.” U. N. Commentary on the Convention on Psycho-\ntropic Substances 387, 385 (1976). The court reasoned\nthat hoasca, like the plants from which the tea is made, is\nsufficiently distinct from DMT itself to fall outside the\ntreaty. See 282 F. Supp. 2d, at 1266–1269.\n   We do not agree. The Convention provides that “a\npreparation is subject to the same measures of control as\nthe psychotropic substance which it contains,” and defines\n“preparation” as “any solution or mixture, in whatever\nphysical state, containing one or more psychotropic sub-\nstances.” See 32 U. S. T., at 546, Art. 1(f)(i); id., at 551,\nArt. 3. Hoasca is a “solution or mixture” containing DMT;\nthe fact that it is made by the simple process of brewing\nplants in water, as opposed to some more advanced\nmethod, does not change that. To the extent the commen-\ntary suggests plants themselves are not covered by the\nConvention, that is of no moment—the UDV seeks to\nimport and use a tea brewed from plants, not the plants\nthemselves, and the tea plainly qualifies as a “prepara-\ntion” under the Convention.\n   The fact that hoasca is covered by the Convention,\nhowever, does not automatically mean that the Govern-\nment has demonstrated a compelling interest in applying\nthe Controlled Substances Act, which implements the\nConvention, to the UDV’s sacramental use of the tea. At\nthe present stage, it suffices to observe that the Govern-\nment did not even submit evidence addressing the inter-\nnational consequences of granting an exemption for the\nUDV. The Government simply submitted two affidavits\nby State Department officials attesting to the general\nimportance of honoring international obligations and of\nmaintaining the leadership position of the United States\nin the international war on drugs.

We do not doubt the validity of\nthese interests, any more than we doubt the general inter-\nest in promoting public health and safety by enforcing the\nControlled Substances Act, but under RFRA invocation of\nsuch general interests, standing alone, is not enough.2\n                        *     *     *\n  The Government repeatedly invokes Congress’ findings\nand purposes underlying the Controlled Substances Act,\nbut Congress had a reason for enacting RFRA, too. Con-\ngress recognized that “laws ‘neutral’ toward religion may\nburden religious exercise as surely as laws intended to\ninterfere with religious exercise,” and legislated “the\ncompelling interest test” as the means for the courts to\n“strik[e] sensible balances between religious liberty and\ncompeting prior governmental interests.” 42 U. S. C.\n§§2000bb(a)(2), (5).\n  We have no cause to pretend that the task assigned by\nCongress to the courts under RFRA is an easy one. In-\ndeed, the very sort of difficulties highlighted by the Gov-\nernment here were cited by this Court in deciding that the\napproach later mandated by Congress under RFRA was\nnot required as a matter of constitutional law under the\nFree Exercise Clause. See Smith, 494 U. S., at 885–890.\nBut Congress has determined that courts should strike\nsensible balances, pursuant to a compelling interest test\nthat requires the Government to address the particular\npractice at issue.
