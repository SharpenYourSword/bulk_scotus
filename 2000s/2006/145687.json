In this case, however, the respondent filed a Rule 50(a) motion before the verdict, but did not file a Rule 50(b) motion after the verdict. Nor did respondent request a new trial under Rule 59. The Court of Appeals nevertheless proceeded to review the sufficiency of the evidence and, upon a finding that the evidence was insufficient, remanded the case for a new trial. Because our cases addressing the requirements of Rule 50 compel a contrary result, we reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*397</span> I</h2>\n<p>The genesis of the underlying litigation in this case was ConAgra's attempt to enforce its patent for \"A Method for Browning Precooked Whole Muscle Meat Products,\" U.S. Patent No. 5,952,027 ('027 patent). In early 2000, ConAgra issued a general warning to companies who sold equipment and processes for browning precooked meats explaining that it intended to \"`aggressively protect all of [its] rights under [the '027] patent.'\" 375 F.3d 1341, 1344 (CA Fed. 2004). Petitioner Unitherm sold such processes, but did not receive ConAgra's warning. ConAgra also contacted its direct competitors in the precooked meat business, announcing that it was \"`making the '027 Patent and corresponding patents that may issue available for license at a royalty rate of 10\u00a2 per pound.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1345. Jennie-O, a direct competitor, received ConAgra's correspondence and undertook an investigation to determine its rights and responsibilities with regard to the '027 patent. Jennie-O determined that the browning process it had purchased from Unitherm was the same as the process described in the '027 patent. Jennie-O further determined that the '027 patent was invalid because Unitherm's president had invented the process described in that patent six years before ConAgra filed its patent application.</p>\n<p>Consistent with these determinations, Jennie-O and Unitherm jointly sued ConAgra in the Western District of Oklahoma. As relevant here, Jennie-O and Unitherm sought a declaration that the '027 patent was invalid and unenforceable, and alleged that ConAgra had violated \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act, ch. 647, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, by attempting to enforce a patent that was obtained by committing fraud on the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). See <i>Walker Process Equipment, Inc.</i> v. <i>Food Machinery &amp; Chemical Corp.,</i> 382 U.S. 172, 174 (1965) (holding that \"the enforcement of a patent procured by fraud on the Patent Office may be violative of \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act provided <span class=\"star-pagination\">*398</span> the other elements necessary to a \u00a7 2 case are present\"). The District Court construed the '027 patent and determined that it was invalid based on Unitherm's prior public use and sale of the process described therein. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b). After dismissing Jennie-O for lack of antitrust standing, the District Court allowed Unitherm's <i>Walker Process</i> claim to proceed to trial. Prior to the court's submission of the case to the jury, ConAgra moved for a directed verdict under Rule 50(a) based on legal insufficiency of the evidence. The District Court denied that motion.<sup>[1]</sup> The jury returned a verdict for Unitherm, and ConAgra neither renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(b), nor moved for a new trial on antitrust liability pursuant to Rule 59.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>On appeal to the Federal Circuit, ConAgra maintained that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the jury's <i>Walker Process</i> verdict. Although the Federal Circuit has concluded that a party's \"failure to present the district court with a post-verdict motion precludes appellate review of sufficiency of the evidence,\" <i>Biodex Corp.</i> v. <i>Loredan Biomedical, Inc.,</i> 946 F. 2d 850, 862 (1991), in the instant case it was bound to apply the law of the Tenth Circuit, 375 F.3d, at 1365, n. 7 (\"On most issues related to Rule 50 motions . . . we generally apply regional circuit law unless the precise <span class=\"star-pagination\">*399</span> issue being appealed pertains uniquely to patent law\"). Under Tenth Circuit law, a party that has failed to file a postverdict motion challenging the sufficiency of the evidence may nonetheless raise such a claim on appeal, so long as that party filed a Rule 50(a) motion prior to submission of the case to the jury. <i>Cummings</i> v. <i>General Motors Corp.,</i> 365 F.3d 944, 950-951 (2004). Notably, the only available relief in such a circumstance is a new trial. <i>Id.,</i> at 951.</p>\n<p>Freed to examine the sufficiency of the evidence, the Federal Circuit concluded that, although Unitherm had presented sufficient evidence to support a determination that ConAgra had attempted to enforce a patent that it had obtained through fraud on the PTO, 375 F.3d, at 1362, Unitherm had failed to present evidence sufficient to support the remaining elements of its antitrust claim. <i>Id.,</i> at 1365 (\"Unitherm failed to present any economic evidence capable of sustaining its asserted relevant antitrust market, and little to support any other aspect of its Section 2 claim\"). Accordingly, it vacated the jury's judgment in favor of Unitherm and remanded for a new trial. We granted certiorari, 543 U.S. 1186 (2005), and now reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 sets forth the procedural requirements for challenging the sufficiency of the evidence in a civil jury trial and establishes two stages for such challenges\u0097prior to submission of the case to the jury, and after the verdict and entry of judgment. Rule 50(a) allows a party to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence prior to submission of the case to the jury, and authorizes the district court to grant such motions at the court's discretion:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(a) JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) If during a trial by jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue, the court may determine the issue against <span class=\"star-pagination\">*400</span> that party and may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against that party with respect to a claim or defense that cannot under the controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) Motions for judgment as a matter of law may be made at any time before submission of the case to the jury. Such a motion shall specify the judgment sought and the law and the facts on which the moving party is entitled to the judgment.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Rule 50(b), by contrast, sets forth the procedural requirements for renewing a sufficiency of the evidence challenge after the jury verdict and entry of judgment.</p>\n<blockquote>\"(b) RENEWING MOTION FOR JUDGMENT AFTER TRIAL; ALTERNATIVE MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL. If, for any reason, the court does not grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of all the evidence, the court is considered to have submitted the action to the jury subject to the court's later deciding the legal questions raised by the motion. The movant may renew its request for judgment as a matter of law by filing a motion no later than 10 days after entry of judgment\u0097and may alternatively request a new trial or join a motion for a new trial under Rule 59. In ruling on a renewed motion, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) if a verdict was returned:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(A) allow the judgment to stand,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) order a new trial, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(C) direct entry of judgment as a matter of law....\"</blockquote>\n<p>This Court has addressed the implications of a party's failure to file a postverdict motion under Rule 50(b) on several occasions and in a variety of procedural contexts. This Court has concluded that, \"[i]n the absence of such a motion\" an \"appellate court [is] without power to direct the District <span class=\"star-pagination\">*401</span> Court to enter judgment contrary to the one it had permitted to stand.\" <i>Cone</i> v. <i>West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper Co.,</i> 330 U.S. 212, 218 (1947). This Court has similarly concluded that a party's failure to file a Rule 50(b) motion deprives the appellate court of the power to order the entry of judgment in favor of that party where the district court directed the jury's verdict, <i>Globe Liquor Co.</i> v. <i>San Roman,</i> 332 U.S. 571 (1948), and where the district court expressly reserved a party's preverdict motion for a directed verdict and then denied that motion after the verdict was returned, <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co.,</i> 344 U.S. 48 (1952). A postverdict motion is necessary because \"[d]etermination of whether a new trial should be granted or a judgment entered under Rule 50(b) calls for the judgment in the first instance of the judge who saw and heard the witnesses and has the feel of the case which no appellate printed transcript can impart.\"<sup>[3]</sup><i>Cone, supra,</i> at 216. Moreover, the \"requirement of a timely application for judgment after verdict is not an idle motion\" because it \"is . . . an essential part of the rule, firmly grounded in principles of fairness.\" <i>Johnson, supra,</i> at 53.</p>\n<p>The foregoing authorities lead us to reverse the judgment below. Respondent correctly points out that these authorities address whether an appellate court may enter judgment in the absence of a postverdict motion, as opposed to whether an appellate court may order a new trial (as the Federal Circuit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*402</span> did here). But this distinction is immaterial. This Court's observations about the necessity of a postverdict motion under Rule 50(b), and the benefits of the district court's input at that stage, apply with equal force whether a party is seeking judgment as a matter of law or simply a new trial. In <i>Cone,</i> this Court concluded that, because Rule 50(b) permits the district court to exercise its discretion to choose between ordering a new trial and entering judgment, its \"appraisal of the bona fides of the claims asserted by the litigants is of great value in reaching a conclusion as to whether a <i>new trial</i> should be granted.\" 330 U.S., at 216 (emphasis added). Similarly, this Court has determined that a party may only pursue on appeal a particular avenue of relief available under Rule 50(b), namely, the entry of judgment <i>or a new trial,</i> when that party has complied with the Rule's filing requirements by requesting that particular relief below. See <i>Johnson, supra,</i> at 54 (\"Respondent made a motion to set aside the verdict and for new trial within the time required by Rule 50(b). It failed to comply with permission given by 50(b) to move for judgment <i>n. o. v.</i> after the verdict. In this situation respondent is entitled only to a new trial, not to a judgment in its favor\").<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*403</span> Despite the straightforward language employed in <i>Cone, Globe Liquor,</i> and <i>Johnson,</i> respondent maintains that those cases dictate affirmance here, because in each of those cases the litigants secured a new trial. But in each of those cases the appellants moved for a new trial postverdict in the District Court, and did not seek to establish their entitlement to a new trial solely on the basis of a denied Rule 50(a) motion. See <i>Cone, supra,</i> at 213 (noting that respondent moved for a new trial);<sup>[5]</sup><i>Globe Liquor, supra,</i> at 572 (\"The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*404</span> respondents . . . moved for a new trial on the ground . . . that there were many contested issues of fact\"). Indeed, <i>Johnson</i> concluded that respondent was <i>only</i> entitled to a new trial by virtue of its motion for such \"within the time required by Rule 50(b).\" 344 U.S., at 54. Accordingly, these outcomes merely underscore our holding today\u0097a party is not entitled to pursue a new trial on appeal unless that party makes an appropriate postverdict motion in the district court.</p>\n<p>Our determination that respondent's failure to comply with Rule 50(b) forecloses its challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is further validated by the purported basis of respondent's appeal, namely, the District Court's denial of respondent's preverdict Rule 50(a) motion. As an initial matter, <i>Cone, Globe Liquor,</i> and <i>Johnson</i> unequivocally establish that the precise subject matter of a party's Rule 50(a) motion\u0097namely, its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law\u0097cannot be appealed unless that motion is renewed pursuant to Rule 50(b). Here, respondent does not seek to pursue on appeal the precise claim it raised in its Rule 50(a) motion before the District Court\u0097namely, its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. Rather, it seeks a <i>new trial</i> based on the legal insufficiency of the evidence. But if, as in <i>Cone, Globe Liquor,</i> and <i>Johnson,</i> a litigant that has failed to file a Rule 50(b) motion is foreclosed from seeking the relief it sought in its Rule 50(a) motion\u0097<i>i. e.,</i> the entry of judgment\u0097then surely respondent is foreclosed from seeking a new trial, relief it did not and could not seek in its preverdict motion. In short, respondent never sought a new trial before the District Court, and thus forfeited its right to do so on appeal. <i>Yakus</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 321 U.S. 414, 444 (1944) (\"No procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a . . . right may be forfeited . . . by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*405</span> failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it\").</p>\n<p>The text of Rule 50(b) confirms that respondent's preverdict Rule 50(a) motion did not present the District Court with the option of ordering a new trial. That text provides that a district court may only order a new trial on the basis of issues raised in a preverdict Rule 50(a) motion when \"ruling on a renewed motion\" under Rule 50(b). Accordingly, even if the District Court was inclined to grant a new trial on the basis of arguments raised in respondent's preverdict motion, it was without the power to do so under Rule 50(b) absent a postverdict motion pursuant to that Rule. Consequently, the Court of Appeals was similarly powerless.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the text and application of Rule 50(a) support our determination that respondent may not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal on the basis of the District Court's denial of its Rule 50(a) motion. The Rule provides that \"the court <i>may</i> determine\" that \"there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for [a] party on [a given] issue,\" and \"<i>may</i> grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against that party . . . .\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, while a district court is permitted to enter judgment as a matter of law when it concludes that the evidence is legally insufficient, it is not required to do so. To the contrary, the district courts are, if anything, encouraged to submit the case to the jury, rather than granting such motions. As Wright and Miller explain:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Even at the close of all the evidence it may be desirable to refrain from granting a motion for judgment as a matter of law despite the fact that it would be possible for the district court to do so. If judgment as a matter of law is granted and the appellate court holds that the evidence in fact was sufficient to go to the jury, an entire new trial must be had. If, on the other hand, the trial court submits the case to the jury, though it thinks the evidence insufficient, final determination of the case is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*406</span> expedited greatly. If the jury agrees with the court's appraisal of the evidence, and returns a verdict for the party who moved for judgment as a matter of law, the case is at an end. If the jury brings in a different verdict, the trial court can grant a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law. Then if the appellate court holds that the trial court was in error in its appraisal of the evidence, it can reverse and order judgment on the verdict of the jury, without any need for a new trial. For this reason the appellate courts repeatedly have said that it usually is desirable to take a verdict, and then pass on the sufficiency of the evidence on a post-verdict motion.\" 9A Federal Practice \u00a7 2533, at 319 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, the District Court's denial of respondent's preverdict motion cannot form the basis of respondent's appeal, because the denial of that motion was not error. It was merely an exercise of the District Court's discretion, in accordance with the text of the Rule and the accepted practice of permitting the jury to make an initial judgment about the sufficiency of the evidence. The only error here was counsel's failure to file a postverdict motion pursuant to Rule 50(b).<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*407</span> * * *</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we hold that since respondent failed to renew its preverdict motion as specified in Rule 50(b), there was no basis for review of respondent's sufficiency of the evidence challenge in the Court of Appeals. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Murphy's law applies to trial lawyers as well as pilots. Even an expert will occasionally blunder. For that reason Congress has preserved the federal appeals courts' power to correct plain error, even though trial counsel's omission will ordinarily give rise to a binding waiver. This is not a case, in my view, in which the authority of the appellate court is limited by an explicit statute or controlling rule. The spirit of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure favors preservation of a court's power to avoid manifestly unjust results in exceptional cases. See <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co.,</i> 344 U.S. 48, 62 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) (\"`Procedure is the means; full, equal and exact enforcement of substantive law is the end'\" (quoting Pound, The Etiquette of Justice, 3 Proceedings Neb. St. Bar Assn. 231 (1909))). Moreover, we have an overriding duty to obey statutory commands that unambiguously express the intent of Congress even in areas such as procedure in which we may have special expertise.</p>\n<p>Today, relying primarily on a case decided in March 1947, <i>Cone</i> v. <i>West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper Co.,</i> 330 U.S. 212, and a case decided in January 1948, <i>Globe Liquor Co.</i> v. <i>San</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*408</span> <i>Roman,</i> 332 U.S. 571, the Court holds that the Court of Appeals was \"powerless\" to review the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the verdict in petitioner's favor because respondent failed to file proper postverdict motions pursuant to Rules 50(b) and 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in the trial court. <i>Ante,</i> at 405. The majority's holding is inconsistent with a statute enacted just months after <i>Globe Liquor</i> was decided. That statute, which remains in effect today, provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The Supreme Court or any other court of appellate jurisdiction may affirm, modify, vacate, set aside or reverse any judgment, decree, or order of a court lawfully brought before it for review, and may remand the cause and direct the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106.</blockquote>\n<p>Nothing in Rule 50(b) limits this statutory grant of power to appellate courts; while a party's failure to make a Rule 50(b) motion precludes the <i>district court</i> from directing a verdict in that party's favor, the Rule does not purport to strip the courts of appeals of the authority to review district court judgments or to order such relief as \"may be just under the circumstances.\" Nor do general principles of waiver or forfeiture have that effect. Cf. <i>ante,</i> at 404-405. It is well settled that a litigant's waiver or forfeiture of an argument does not, in the absence of a contrary statutory command, preclude the courts of appeals from considering those arguments. See <i>Singleton</i> v. <i>Wulff,</i> 428 U.S. 106, 121 (1976). Arguments raised for the first time on appeal may be entertained, for example, if their consideration would prevent manifest injustice. <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*409</span> For the reasons articulated by the Court in <i>Cone,</i> 330 U.S., at 216, it may be unfair or even an abuse of discretion for a court of appeals to direct a verdict in favor of the party that lost below if that party failed to make a timely Rule 50(b) motion. Likewise, it may not be \"just under the circumstances\" for a court of appeals to order a new trial in the absence of a proper Rule 59 motion. Finally, a court of appeals has discretion to rebuff, on grounds of waiver or forfeiture, a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence absent a proper Rule 50(b) or Rule 59 motion made in the district court. None of the foregoing propositions rests, however, on a determination that the courts of appeals lack \"power\" to review the sufficiency of the evidence and order appropriate relief under these circumstances, and I can divine no basis for that determination.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Petitioner contends that respondent's Rule 50(a) motion pertained only to the fraud element of petitioner's <i>Walker Process</i> claim, and that it did not encompass the remaining antitrust elements of that claim. Because we conclude that petitioner is entitled to prevail irrespective of the scope of respondent's Rule 50(a) motion, we assume without deciding that that motion pertained to all aspects of petitioner's \u00a7 2 claim. But see Amendments to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 134 F. R. D. 525, 687 (1991) (\"A post-trial motion for judgment can be granted only on grounds advanced in the pre-verdict motion\").</p>\n<p>[2]  While ConAgra did file a postverdict motion seeking a new trial on antitrust damages, that motion did not seek to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence establishing antitrust liability and thus has no bearing on the instant case.</p>\n<p>[3]  Neither <i>Neely</i> v. <i>Martin K. Eby Constr. Co.,</i> 386 U.S. 317 (1967), nor <i>Weisgram</i> v. <i>Marley Co.,</i> 528 U.S. 440 (2000), undermine our judgment about the benefit of postverdict input from the district court. In those cases this Court determined that an appellate court may, in certain circumstances, direct the entry of judgment when it reverses the district court's denial of a Rule 50(b) motion. But in such circumstances the district court will have had an opportunity to consider the propriety of entering judgment or ordering a new trial by virtue of the postverdict motion. Moreover, these cases reiterate the value of the district court's input, cautioning the courts of appeals to be \"`constantly alert' to `the trial judge's first-hand knowledge of witnesses, testimony, and issues.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 443 (quoting <i>Neely, supra,</i> at 325).</p>\n<p>[4]  The dissent's suggestion that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 permits the courts of appeals to consider the sufficiency of the evidence underlying a civil jury verdict notwithstanding a party's failure to comply with Rule 50 is foreclosed by authority of this Court. While the dissent observes that \u00a7 2106 was enacted after <i>Cone</i> and <i>Globe Liquor Co.</i> v. <i>San Roman,</i> 332 U.S. 571 (1948), <i>post,</i> at 408 (opinion of STEVENS, J.), it fails to note that it was enacted prior to <i>Johnson. Johnson</i> explicitly reaffirmed those earlier cases, concluding that \"in the absence of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict made in the trial court within ten days after reception of a verdict [Rule 50] forbids the trial judge or an appellate court to enter such a judgment.\" 344 U.S., at 50. Moreover, in <i>Neely,</i> this Court observed that \u00a7 2106 is \"broad enough to include the power to direct entry of judgment <i>n. o. v.</i> on appeal,\" 386 U.S., at 322, but nonetheless reaffirmed that <i>Cone, Globe Liquor,</i> and <i>Johnson</i> \"make it clear that an appellate court may not order judgment <i>n. o. v.</i> where the verdict loser has failed strictly to comply with the procedural requirements of Rule 50(b),\" 386 U.S., at 325. Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, <i>Neely</i> confirms that the broad grant of authority to the courts of appeals in \u00a7 2106 must be exercised consistent with the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as interpreted by this Court.\n</p>\n<p>The dissent's approach is not only foreclosed by authority of this Court, it also may present Seventh Amendment concerns. The implication of the dissent's interpretation of \u00a7 2106 is that a court of appeals would be free to examine the sufficiency of the evidence regardless of whether the appellant had filed a Rule 50(a) motion in the district court and, in the event the appellant had filed a Rule 50(a) motion, regardless of whether the district court had ever <i>ruled</i> on that motion. The former is squarely foreclosed by <i>Slocum</i> v. <i>New York Life Ins. Co.,</i> 228 U.S. 364 (1913), and the latter is inconsistent with this Court's explanation of the requirements of the Seventh Amendment in <i>Baltimore &amp; Carolina Line, Inc.</i> v. <i>Redman,</i> 295 U.S. 654, 658 (1935) (explaining that \"under the pertinent rules of the common law the court of appeals could set aside the verdict for error of law, such as the trial court's <i>ruling</i> respecting the sufficiency of the evidence, and direct a new trial, but could not itself determine the issues of fact and direct a judgment for the defendant, for this would cut off the plaintiff's unwaived right to have the issues of fact determined by a jury\" (emphasis added)). Indeed, Rule 50 was drafted with such concerns in mind. See 9A C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2522, pp. 244-246 (2d ed. 1995) (hereinafter Federal Practice).</p>\n<p>[5]  While the precise nature of the new trial motion at issue in <i>Cone</i> is difficult to ascertain from this Court's description of that motion, the Court of Appeals opinion in that case confirms that the movant had properly objected to the admission of certain evidence, and then moved postverdict \"for a new trial [on the basis of the inadmissible evidence] and later renewed this motion upon the basis of newly-discovered evidence.\" <i>West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper Co.</i> v. <i>Cone,</i> 153 F. 2d 576, 580 (CA4 1946). This Court did not disturb the Court of Appeals' holding that formed the basis of the movant's entitlement to a new trial, namely, \"the Circuit Court of Appeals' holding that there was prejudicial error in the admission of evidence.\" 330 U.S., at 215.</p>\n<p>[6]  Respondent claims that its failure to renew its Rule 50(a) motion was in reliance on the Tenth Circuit's determination that it could order a new trial in the absence of a Rule 50(b) motion. But respondent cannot credibly maintain that it wanted the Court of Appeals to order a new trial as opposed to entering judgment. And, as the Tenth Circuit has recognized, respondent could not obtain the entry of judgment unless it complied with Rule 50(b). <i>Cummings</i> v. <i>General Motors Corp.,</i> 365 F.3d 944, 951 (2004). Respondent therefore had every incentive to comply with that Rule's requirements. Accordingly, we reject its contention that our application of Rule 50(b) to the instant case is impermissibly retroactive. See also <i>Harper</i> v. <i>Virginia Dept. of Taxation,</i> 509 U.S. 86, 97 (1993) (\"[W]e can scarcely permit the substantive law to shift and spring according to the particular equities of individual parties' claims of actual reliance on an old rule and of harm from a retroactive application of the new rule\" (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).</p>\n<p>[7]  We reject respondent's contention that it is entitled to a remand for reconsideration in light of <i>Phillips</i> v. <i>AWH Corp.,</i> 415 F.3d 1303 (CA Fed. 2005). The Federal Circuit has already denied respondent's petition for rehearing raising this issue.</p>\n<p>[*]  The Court suggests that the Seventh Amendment limits appellate courts' power to review judgments under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106. See <i>ante,</i> at 402-403, n. 4. I disagree with the Court's analysis in two respects. First, although the right to trial by jury might be implicated if no Rule 50(a) motion had been made, such a motion <i>was</i> made in this case. The Rule 50(a) motion triggered the automatic reservation of \"legal questions,\" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 50(b), and that reservation, in turn, averted any Seventh Amendment problem, see <i>Baltimore &amp; Carolina Line, Inc.</i> v. <i>Redman,</i> 295 U.S. 654 (1935). Second, the Seventh Amendment imposes no greater restriction on appellate courts than it does on district courts in these circumstances; \"[a]s far as the Seventh Amendment's right to jury trial is concerned, there is no greater restriction on the province of the jury when an appellate court enters judgment <i>n. o. v.</i> than when a trial court does.\" <i>Neely</i> v. <i>Martin K. Eby Constr. Co.,</i> 386 U.S. 317, 322 (1967).</p>\n\n</div>",

SWIFT-\r\n     ECKRICH, INC., DBA CONAGRA REFRIGERATED\r\n                        FOODS\r\n\r\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\r\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\r\n\r\n  No. 04\u2013597.      Argued November 2, 2005\u2014Decided January 23, 2006\r\nAfter respondent ConAgra warned companies selling equipment and\r\n  processes for browning precooked meats that it intended to protect its\r\n  rights under its patent for that process, petitioner Unitherm, whose\r\n  president had invented the process six years before ConAgra filed its\r\n  patent application, and one of ConAgra\u2019s direct competitors jointly\r\n  filed suit in an Oklahoma federal court. As relevant here, they\r\n  sought a declaration that ConAgra\u2019s patent was invalid and unen-\r\n  forceable and alleged that ConAgra had violated \u00a72 of the Sherman\r\n  Act by attempting to enforce a patent obtained by fraud on the Patent\r\n  and Trademark Office, see Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food\r\n  Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 U. S. 172, 174. The District Court\r\n  found the patent invalid and allowed the Walker Process claim to pro-\r\n  ceed to trial. Before the case was submitted to the jury, ConAgra\r\n  moved for a directed verdict under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\r\n  50(a) based on legal insufficiency of the evidence. The court denied\r\n  the motion, the jury returned a verdict for Unitherm, and ConAgra\r\n  neither renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant\r\n  to Rule 50(b) nor moved for a new trial on antitrust liability pursuant\r\n  to Rule 59. On appeal to the Federal Circuit, ConAgra maintained\r\n  that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the Walker Process\r\n  verdict. The court applied Tenth Circuit law, under which a party\r\n  that has failed to file a postverdict sufficiency of the evidence chal-\r\n  lenge may nonetheless raise such a claim on appeal, so long as the\r\n  party filed a Rule 50(a) motion before submission of the case to the\r\n  jury. The only available relief in such a circumstance is a new trial.\r\n  Freed to examine the sufficiency of the evidence, the Federal Circuit\r\n2    UNITHERM FOOD SYSTEMS, INC. v. SWIFT-ECKRICH, INC.\r\n\r\n                                Syllabus\r\n\r\n    vacated the judgment and ordered a new trial.\r\nHeld: Since respondent failed to renew its preverdict motion as speci-\r\n fied in Rule 50(b), the Federal Circuit had no basis for reviewing re-\r\n spondent\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence challenge. Rule 50 sets forth\r\n the requirements, establishing two stages, for challenging the suffi-\r\n ciency of the evidence in a civil jury trial. Rule 50(a) allows a chal-\r\n lenge prior to the case\u2019s submission to the jury, authorizing the dis-\r\n trict court to grant the motion at the court\u2019s discretion. Rule 50(b),\r\n by contrast, sets forth the requirements for renewing the challenge\r\n after the jury verdict and entry of judgment. A party\u2019s failure to file\r\n a Rule 50(b) postverdict motion deprives an appellate court of the\r\n \u201cpower to direct the District Court to enter judgment contrary to the\r\n one it had permitted to stand.\u201d Cone v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper\r\n Co., 330 U. S. 212, 218. It also deprives an appellate court of the\r\n power to order the entry of judgment in favor of that party where the\r\n district court directed the jury\u2019s verdict, Globe Liquor Co. v. San Ro-\r\n man, 332 U. S. 571, and where the district court expressly reserved a\r\n party\u2019s preverdict directed verdict motion and then denied it after the\r\n verdict, Johnson v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., 344 U. S. 48. A\r\n postverdict motion is necessary because determining \u201cwhether a new\r\n trial should be granted or a judgment entered under Rule 50(b) calls\r\n for the judgment in the first instance of the judge who saw and heard\r\n the witnesses and has the feel of the case which no appellate printed\r\n transcript can impart.\u201d Cone, supra, at 216. Moreover, the require-\r\n ment \u201cis not an idle motion\u201d but \u201can essential part of the rule, firmly\r\n grounded in principles of fairness.\u201d Johnson, supra, at 53. These au-\r\n thorities require reversal of the judgment below. This Court\u2019s obser-\r\n vations about the postverdict motion\u2019s necessity and the benefits of\r\n the district court\u2019s input at that stage apply with equal force whether\r\n a party is seeking judgment as a matter of law or simply a new trial.\r\n Contrary to respondent\u2019s argument, the Cone, Globe Liquor, and\r\n Johnson outcomes underscore this holding. Those litigants all se-\r\n cured new trials, but they had moved for a new trial postverdict in\r\n the district court and did not seek to establish their entitlement to a\r\n new trial based solely on a denied Rule 50(a) motion. This result is\r\n further validated by the purported basis of respondent\u2019s appeal,\r\n namely the District Court\u2019s denial of its Rule 50(a) motion. Cone,\r\n Globe Liquor, and Johnson unequivocally establish that the precise\r\n subject matter of a party\u2019s Rule 50(a) motion cannot be appealed\r\n unless that motion is renewed pursuant to Rule 50(b). Respondent,\r\n rather than seeking to appeal the claim raised in its Rule 50(a) mo-\r\n tion, seeks a new trial based on legal insufficiency of the evidence. If\r\n a litigant that has failed to file a Rule 50(b) motion is foreclosed from\r\n seeking the relief sought in its Rule 50(a) motion, then surely re-\r\n                      Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)                       3\r\n\r\n                                 Syllabus\r\n\r\n  spondent is foreclosed from seeking relief it did not and could not\r\n  seek in its preverdict motion. Rule 50(b)\u2019s text confirms that respon-\r\n  dent\u2019s Rule 50(a) motion did not give the District Court the option of\r\n  ordering a new trial, for it provides that a district court may only or-\r\n  der a new trial based on issues raised in a Rule 50(a) motion when\r\n  \u201cruling on a renewed motion\u201d under Rule 50(b). If the District Court\r\n  lacked such power, then the Court of Appeals was similarly power-\r\n  less. Rule 50(a)\u2019s text and application also support this result. A dis-\r\n  trict court may enter judgment as a matter of law when it concludes\r\n  that the evidence is legally insufficient, but it is not required to do so.\r\n  Thus, the denial of respondent\u2019s Rule 50(a) motion was not error, but\r\n  merely an exercise of the District Court\u2019s discretion.

In this case, however, the respondent filed a\r\nRule 50(a) motion before the verdict, but did not file a\r\nRule 50(b) motion after the verdict. Nor did respondent\r\nrequest a new trial under Rule 59. The Court of Appeals\r\nnevertheless proceeded to review the sufficiency of the\r\nevidence and, upon a finding that the evidence was insuf-\r\nficient, remanded the case for a new trial. Because our\r\ncases addressing the requirements of Rule 50 compel a\r\ncontrary result, we reverse.\r\n                            I\r\n  The genesis of the underlying litigation in this case was\r\nConAgra\u2019s attempt to enforce its patent for \u201cA Method for\r\n2   UNITHERM FOOD SYSTEMS, INC. v. SWIFT-ECKRICH, INC.\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nBrowning Precooked Whole Muscle Meat Products,\u201d U. S.\r\nPatent No. 5,952,027 (\u2019027 patent). In early 2000, Con-\r\nAgra issued a general warning to companies who sold\r\nequipment and processes for browning precooked meats\r\nexplaining that it intended to \u201c \u2018aggressively protect all of\r\n[its] rights under [the \u2019027] patent.\u2019 \u201d 375 F. 3d 1341, 1344\r\n(CA Fed. 2004). Petitioner Unitherm sold such processes,\r\nbut did not receive ConAgra\u2019s warning. ConAgra also\r\ncontacted its direct competitors in the precooked meat\r\nbusiness, announcing that it was \u201c \u2018making the \u2019027 Patent\r\nand corresponding patents that may issue available for\r\nlicense at a royalty rate of 10\u00a2 per pound.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 1345.\r\nJennie-O, a direct competitor, received ConAgra\u2019s corre-\r\nspondence and undertook an investigation to determine its\r\nrights and responsibilities with regard to the \u2019027 patent.\r\nJennie-O determined that the browning process it had\r\npurchased from Unitherm was the same as the process\r\ndescribed in the \u2019027 patent. Jennie-O further determined\r\nthat the \u2019027 patent was invalid because Unitherm\u2019s\r\npresident had invented the process described in that pat-\r\nent six years before ConAgra filed its patent application.\r\n   Consistent with these determinations, Jennie-O and\r\nUnitherm jointly sued ConAgra in the Western District of\r\nOklahoma. As relevant here, Jennie-O and Unitherm\r\nsought a declaration that the \u2019027 patent was invalid and\r\nunenforceable, and alleged that ConAgra had violated \u00a72\r\nof the Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C. \u00a72, by attempting to en-\r\nforce a patent that was obtained by committing fraud on\r\nthe Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). See Walker\r\nProcess Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical\r\nCorp., 382 U. S. 172, 174 (1965) (holding that \u201cthe enforce-\r\nment of a patent procured by fraud on the Patent Office may\r\nbe violative of \u00a72 of the Sherman Act provided the other\r\nelements necessary to a \u00a72 case are present\u201d). The District\r\nCourt construed the \u2019027 patent and determined that it was\r\ninvalid based on Unitherm\u2019s prior public use and sale of the\r\n                     Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)                     3\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nprocess described therein. 35 U. S. C. \u00a7102(b). After dis-\r\nmissing Jennie-O for lack of antitrust standing, the District\r\nCourt allowed Unitherm\u2019s Walker Process claim to proceed\r\nto trial. Prior to the court\u2019s submission of the case to the\r\njury, ConAgra moved for a directed verdict under Rule 50(a)\r\nbased on legal insufficiency of the evidence. The District\r\nCourt denied that motion.1 The jury returned a verdict for\r\nUnitherm, and ConAgra neither renewed its motion for\r\njudgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(b), nor\r\nmoved for a new trial on antitrust liability pursuant to Rule\r\n59.2\r\n  On appeal to the Federal Circuit, ConAgra maintained\r\nthat there was insufficient evidence to sustain the jury\u2019s\r\nWalker Process verdict. Although the Federal Circuit has\r\nconcluded that a party\u2019s \u201cfailure to present the district\r\ncourt with a post-verdict motion precludes appellate re-\r\nview of sufficiency of the evidence,\u201d Biodex Corp. v. Lore-\r\ndan Biomedical, Inc., 946 F. 2d 850, 862 (1991), in the\r\ninstant case it was bound to apply the law of the Tenth\r\nCircuit. 375 F. 3d, at 1365, n. 7 (\u201cOn most issues related\r\nto Rule 50 motions . . . we generally apply regional circuit\r\nlaw unless the precise issue being appealed pertains\r\nuniquely to patent law\u201d). Under Tenth Circuit law, a\r\nparty that has failed to file a postverdict motion challeng-\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   1 Petitioner contends that respondent\u2019s Rule 50(a) motion pertained\r\n\r\nonly to the fraud element of petitioner\u2019s Walker Process claim, and that\r\nit did not encompass the remaining antitrust elements of that claim.\r\nBecause we conclude that petitioner is entitled to prevail irrespective of\r\nthe scope of respondent\u2019s Rule 50(a) motion, we assume without decid-\r\ning that that motion pertained to all aspects of petitioner\u2019s \u00a72 claim.\r\nBut see Amendments to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 134 F. R. D.\r\n525, 687 (1991) (\u201cA post-trial motion for judgment can be granted only\r\non grounds advanced in the pre-verdict motion\u201d).\r\n   2 While ConAgra did file a postverdict motion seeking a new trial on\r\n\r\nantitrust damages, that motion did not seek to challenge the sufficiency\r\nof the evidence establishing antitrust liability and thus has no bearing\r\non the instant case.\r\n4   UNITHERM FOOD SYSTEMS, INC. v. SWIFT-ECKRICH, INC.\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ning the sufficiency of the evidence may nonetheless raise\r\nsuch a claim on appeal, so long as that party filed a Rule\r\n50(a) motion prior to submission of the case to the jury.\r\nCummings v. General Motors Corp., 365 F. 3d 944, 950\u2013\r\n951 (2004). Notably, the only available relief in such a\r\ncircumstance is a new trial. Id., at 951.\r\n   Freed to examine the sufficiency of the evidence, the\r\nFederal Circuit concluded that, although Unitherm had\r\npresented sufficient evidence to support a determination\r\nthat ConAgra had attempted to enforce a patent that it\r\nhad obtained through fraud on the PTO, 375 F. 3d, at\r\n1362, Unitherm had failed to present evidence sufficient to\r\nsupport the remaining elements of its antitrust claim. Id.,\r\nat 1365 (\u201cUnitherm failed to present any economic evi-\r\ndence capable of sustaining its asserted relevant antitrust\r\nmarket, and little to support any other aspect of its Sec-\r\ntion 2 claim\u201d). Accordingly, it vacated the jury\u2019s judgment\r\nin favor of Unitherm and remanded for a new trial. We\r\ngranted certiorari, 543 U. S. 1186 (2005), and now reverse.\r\n                               II\r\n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 sets forth the proce-\r\ndural requirements for challenging the sufficiency of the\r\nevidence in a civil jury trial and establishes two stages for\r\nsuch challenges\u2014prior to submission of the case to the\r\njury, and after the verdict and entry of judgment. Rule\r\n50(a) allows a party to challenge the sufficiency of the\r\nevidence prior to submission of the case to the jury, and\r\nauthorizes the District Court to grant such motions at the\r\ncourt\u2019s discretion:\r\n     \u201c(a) JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW.\r\n       \u201c(1) If during a trial by jury a party has been fully\r\n     heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient\r\n     evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that\r\n     party on that issue, the court may determine the issue\r\n     against that party and may grant a motion for judg-\r\n                 Cite as: 546 U.

If, for\r\n    any reason, the court does not grant a motion for judg-\r\n    ment as a matter of law made at the close of all the\r\n    evidence, the court is considered to have submitted\r\n    the action to the jury subject to the court\u2019s later decid-\r\n    ing the legal questions raised by the motion. The\r\n    movant may renew its request for judgment as a mat-\r\n    ter of law by filing a motion no later than 10 days af-\r\n    ter entry of judgment\u2014and may alternatively request\r\n    a new trial or join a motion for a new trial under Rule\r\n    59. \tIn ruling on a renewed motion, the court may:\r\n      \u201c(1) if a verdict was returned:\r\n      \u201c(A) allow the judgment to stand,\r\n      \u201c(B) order a new trial, or\r\n      \u201c(C) direct entry of judgment as a matter of \r\n\r\n    law . . . .\u201d\r\n  This Court has addressed the implications of a party\u2019s\r\nfailure to file a postverdict motion under Rule 50(b) on\r\nseveral occasions and in a variety of procedural contexts.\r\nThis Court has concluded that, \u201c[i]n the absence of such a\r\nmotion\u201d an \u201cappellate court [is] without power to direct the\r\n6   UNITHERM FOOD SYSTEMS, INC. v.

New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., 344 U. S. 48 (1952).\r\nA postverdict motion is necessary because \u201c[d]etermination\r\nof whether a new trial should be granted or a judgment\r\nentered under Rule 50(b) calls for the judgment in the first\r\ninstance of the judge who saw and heard the witnesses and\r\nhas the feel of the case which no appellate printed transcript\r\ncan impart.\u201d3 Cone, supra, at 216. Moreover, the \u201crequire-\r\nment of a timely application for judgment after verdict is not\r\nan idle motion\u201d because it \u201cis . . . an essential part of the\r\nrule, firmly grounded in principles of fairness.\u201d Johnson,\r\nsupra, at 53.\r\n  The foregoing authorities lead us to reverse the judg-\r\nment below. Respondent correctly points out that these\r\nauthorities address whether an appellate court may enter\r\njudgment in the absence of a postverdict motion, as op-\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   3 Neither Neely v. Martin K. Eby Constr. Co., 386 U. S. 317 (1967), nor\r\n\r\nWeisgram v. Marley Co., 528 U. S. 440 (2000), undermine our judgment\r\nabout the benefit of postverdict input from the district court. In those\r\ncases this Court determined that an appellate court may, in certain\r\ncircumstances, direct the entry of judgment when it reverses the district\r\ncourt\u2019s denial of a Rule 50(b) motion. But in such circumstances the\r\ndistrict court will have had an opportunity to consider the propriety of\r\nentering judgment or ordering a new trial by virtue of the postverdict\r\nmotion. Moreover, these cases reiterate the value of the district court\u2019s\r\ninput, cautioning the courts of appeals to be \u201c \u2018constantly alert\u2019 to \u2018the trial\r\njudge\u2019s first-hand knowledge of witnesses, testimony, and issues.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\r\n443 (quoting Neely, supra, at 325).\r\n                      Cite as: 546 U.

But this distinction is\r\nimmaterial. This Court\u2019s observations about the necessity\r\nof a postverdict motion under Rule 50(b), and the benefits\r\nof the district court\u2019s input at that stage, apply with equal\r\nforce whether a party is seeking judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw or simply a new trial. In Cone, this Court concluded\r\nthat, because Rule 50(b) permits the district court to\r\nexercise its discretion to choose between ordering a new\r\ntrial and entering judgment, its \u201cappraisal of the bona\r\nfides of the claims asserted by the litigants is of great\r\nvalue in reaching a conclusion as to whether a new trial\r\nshould be granted.\u201d 330 U. S., at 216 (emphasis added).\r\nSimilarly, this Court has determined that a party may\r\nonly pursue on appeal a particular avenue of relief avail-\r\nable under Rule 50(b), namely the entry of judgment or a\r\nnew trial, when that party has complied with the Rule\u2019s\r\nfiling requirements by requesting that particular relief\r\nbelow. See Johnson, supra, at 54 (\u201cRespondent made a\r\nmotion to set aside the verdict and for new trial within the\r\ntime required by Rule 50(b). It failed to comply with\r\npermission given by 50(b) to move for judgment n. o. v.\r\nafter the verdict. In this situation respondent is entitled\r\nonly to a new trial, not to a judgment in its favor\u201d).4\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   4 The dissent\u2019s suggestion that 28 U. S. C. \u00a72106 permits the Courts\r\n\r\nof Appeals to consider the sufficiency of the evidence underlying a civil\r\njury verdict notwithstanding a party\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 50 is\r\nforeclosed by authority of this Court. While the dissent observes that\r\n\u00a72106 was enacted after Cone and Globe Liquor Co. v. San Roman, 332\r\nU. S. 571 (1948), post, at 2 (opinion of STEVENS, J.), it fails to note that\r\nit was enacted prior to Johnson. Johnson explicitly reaffirmed those\r\nearlier cases, concluding that \u201cin the absence of a motion for judgment\r\nnotwithstanding the verdict made in the trial court within ten days\r\nafter reception of a verdict [Rule 50] forbids the trial judge or an\r\nappellate court to enter such judgment.\u201d 344 U. S., at 50. Moreover, in\r\nNeely, this Court observed that \u00a72106 is \u201cbroad enough to include the\r\npower to direct entry of judgment n. o. v. on appeal,\u201d 386 U. S., at 322,\r\n8   UNITHERM FOOD SYSTEMS, INC. v. SWIFT-ECKRICH, INC.\r\n\r\n                           Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n  Despite the straightforward language employed in Cone,\r\nGlobe Liquor, and Johnson, respondent maintains that\r\nthose cases dictate affirmance here, because in each of\r\nthose cases the litigants secured a new trial. But in each\r\nof those cases the appellants moved for a new trial post-\r\nverdict in the District Court, and did not seek to establish\r\ntheir entitlement to a new trial solely on the basis of a\r\ndenied Rule 50(a) motion. See Cone, supra, at 213 (noting\r\nthat respondent moved for a new trial);5 Globe Liquor, 332\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nbut nonetheless reaffirmed that Cone, Globe Liquor, and Johnson\r\n\u201cmake it clear that an appellate court may not order judgment n. o. v.\r\nwhere the verdict loser has failed to strictly comply with the procedural\r\nrequirements of Rule 50(b).\u201d 386 U. S., at 325. Contrary to the dis-\r\nsent\u2019s suggestion, Neely confirms that the broad grant of authority to\r\nthe Courts of Appeals in \u00a72106 must be exercised consistent with the\r\nrequirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as interpreted by\r\nthis Court.\r\n   The dissent\u2019s approach is not only foreclosed by authority of this\r\nCourt, it also may present Seventh Amendment concerns. The implica-\r\ntion of the dissent\u2019s interpretation of \u00a72106 is that a court of appeals\r\nwould be free to examine the sufficiency of the evidence regardless of\r\nwhether the appellant had filed a Rule 50(a) motion in the district court\r\nand, in the event the appellant had filed a Rule 50(a) motion, regard-\r\nless of whether the district court had ever ruled on that motion. The\r\nformer is squarely foreclosed by Slocum v. New York Life Ins. Co., 228\r\nU. S. 364 (1913), and the latter is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s explana-\r\ntion of the requirements of the Seventh Amendment in Baltimore &\r\nCarolina Line, Inc. v. Redman, 295 U. S. 654, 658 (1935) (explaining that\r\n\u201cunder the pertinent rules of the common law the court of appeals could\r\nset aside the verdict for error of law, such as the trial court\u2019s ruling\r\nrespecting the sufficiency of the evidence, and direct a new trial, but could\r\nnot itself determine the issues of fact and direct a judgment for the\r\ndefendant, for this would cut off the plaintiff\u2019s unwaived right to have the\r\nissues of fact determined by a jury\u201d (emphasis added)). Indeed, Rule 50\r\nwas drafted with such concerns in mind. See 9A C. Wright & A. Miller,\r\nFederal Practice and Procedure \u00a72522, pp. 244\u2013246 (2d ed. 1995) (herein-\r\nafter Federal Practice).\r\n   5 While the precise nature of the new trial motion at issue in Cone is\r\n\r\ndifficult to ascertain from this Court\u2019s description of that motion, the\r\nCourt of Appeals opinion in that case confirms that the movant had\r\nproperly objected to the admission of certain evidence, and then moved\r\n                     Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)                   9\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nU. S., at 572 (\u201cThe respondents . . . moved for a new trial\r\non the ground . . . that there were many contested issues\r\nof fact\u201d). Indeed, Johnson concluded that respondent was\r\nonly entitled to a new trial by virtue of its motion for such\r\n\u201cwithin the time required by Rule 50(b).\u201d 344 U. S., at 54.\r\nAccordingly, these outcomes merely underscore our hold-\r\ning today\u2014a party is not entitled to pursue a new trial on\r\nappeal unless that party makes an appropriate postverdict\r\nmotion in the district court.\r\n   Our determination that respondent\u2019s failure to comply\r\nwith Rule 50(b) forecloses its challenge to the sufficiency of\r\nthe evidence is further validated by the purported basis of\r\nrespondent\u2019s appeal, namely the District Court\u2019s denial of\r\nrespondent\u2019s preverdict Rule 50(a) motion. As an initial\r\nmatter, Cone, Globe Liquor, and Johnson unequivocally\r\nestablish that the precise subject matter of a party\u2019s Rule\r\n50(a) motion\u2014namely, its entitlement to judgment as a\r\nmatter of law\u2014cannot be appealed unless that motion is\r\nrenewed pursuant to Rule 50(b). Here, respondent does\r\nnot seek to pursue on appeal the precise claim it raised in\r\nits Rule 50(a) motion before the District Court\u2014namely,\r\nits entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. Rather, it\r\nseeks a new trial based on the legal insufficiency of the\r\nevidence. But if, as in Cone, Globe Liquor, and Johnson, a\r\nlitigant that has failed to file a Rule 50(b) motion is fore-\r\nclosed from seeking the relief it sought in its Rule 50(a)\r\nmotion\u2014i.e., the entry of judgment\u2014then surely respon-\r\ndent is foreclosed from seeking a new trial, relief it did not\r\nand could not seek in its preverdict motion. In short,\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\npostverdict \u201cfor a new trial [on the basis of the inadmissible evidence]\r\nand later renewed this motion upon the basis of newly-discovered\r\nevidence.\u201d West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co. v. Cone, 153 F. 2d 576, 580\r\n(CA4 1946). This Court did not disturb the Court of Appeals holding\r\nthat formed the basis of the movant\u2019s entitlement to a new trial,\r\nnamely \u201cthe Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 holding that there was prejudi-\r\ncial error in the admission of evidence.\u201d 330 U. S., at 215.\r\n10 UNITHERM FOOD SYSTEMS, INC. v. SWIFT-ECKRICH, INC.\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nrespondent never sought a new trial before the District\r\nCourt, and thus forfeited its right to do so on appeal.\r\nYakus v. United States, 321 U. S. 414, 444 (1944) (\u201cNo\r\nprocedural principle is more familiar to this Court than\r\nthat a . . . right may be forfeited . . . by the failure to make\r\ntimely assertion of the right before a tribunal having\r\njurisdiction to determine it\u201d).\r\n    The text of Rule 50(b) confirms that respondent\u2019s pre-\r\nverdict Rule 50(a) motion did not present the District\r\nCourt with the option of ordering a new trial. That text\r\nprovides that a district court may only order a new trial on\r\nthe basis of issues raised in a preverdict Rule 50(a) motion\r\nwhen \u201cruling on a renewed motion\u201d under Rule 50(b).\r\nAccordingly, even if the District Court was inclined to\r\ngrant a new trial on the basis of arguments raised in\r\nrespondent\u2019s preverdict motion, it was without the power\r\nto do so under Rule 50(b) absent a postverdict motion\r\npursuant to that Rule. Consequently, the Court of Ap-\r\npeals was similarly powerless.\r\n    Similarly, the text and application of Rule 50(a) support\r\nour determination that respondent may not challenge the\r\nsufficiency of the evidence on appeal on the basis of the\r\nDistrict Court\u2019s denial of its Rule 50(a) motion. The Rule\r\nprovides that \u201cthe court may determine\u201d that \u201cthere is no\r\nlegally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to\r\nfind for [a] party on [a given] issue,\u201d and \u201cmay grant a\r\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law against that party\r\n. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, while a district court is\r\npermitted to enter judgment as a matter of law when it\r\nconcludes that the evidence is legally insufficient, it is not\r\nrequired to do so. To the contrary, the district courts are,\r\nif anything, encouraged to submit the case to the jury,\r\nrather than granting such motions. As Wright and Miller\r\nexplain:\r\n       \u201cEven at the close of all the evidence it may be de-\r\n                     Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)                  11\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n     sirable to refrain from granting a motion for judgment\r\n     as a matter of law despite the fact that it would be\r\n     possible for the district court to do so. If judgment as\r\n     a matter of law is granted and the appellate court\r\n     holds that the evidence in fact was sufficient to go to\r\n     the jury, an entire new trial must be had. If, on the\r\n     other hand, the trial court submits the case to the\r\n     jury, though it thinks the evidence insufficient, final\r\n     determination of the case is expedited greatly. If the\r\n     jury agrees with the court\u2019s appraisal of the evidence,\r\n     and returns a verdict for the party who moved for\r\n     judgment as a matter of law, the case is at an end. If\r\n     the jury brings in a different verdict, the trial court\r\n     can grant a renewed motion for judgment as a matter\r\n     of law. Then if the appellate court holds that the trial\r\n     court was in error in is appraisal of the evidence, it\r\n     can reverse and order judgment on the verdict of the\r\n     jury, without any need for a new trial. For this reason\r\n     the appellate courts repeatedly have said that it usu-\r\n     ally is desirable to take a verdict, and then pass on\r\n     the sufficiency of the evidence on a post-verdict mo-\r\n     tion.\u201d 9A Federal Practice \u00a72533, at 319 (footnote\r\n     omitted).\r\nThus, the District Court\u2019s denial of respondent\u2019s preverdict\r\nmotion cannot form the basis of respondent\u2019s appeal,\r\nbecause the denial of that motion was not error. It was\r\nmerely an exercise of the District Court\u2019s discretion, in\r\naccordance with the text of the Rule and the accepted\r\npractice of permitting the jury to make an initial judgment\r\nabout the sufficiency of the evidence. The only error here\r\nwas counsel\u2019s failure to file a postverdict motion pursuant\r\nto Rule 50(b).6\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  6 Respondent claims that its failure to renew its Rule 50(a) motion\r\n\r\nwas in reliance on the Tenth Circuit\u2019s determination that it could order\r\na new trial in the absence of a Rule 50(b) motion. But respondent\r\n12 UNITHERM FOOD SYSTEMS, INC. v.

And, as the Tenth Circuit\r\nhas recognized, respondent could not obtain the entry of judgment\r\nunless it complied with Rule 50(b). Cummings v. General Motors Corp.,\r\n365 F. 3d 944, 951 (2004). Respondent therefore had every incentive to\r\ncomply with that Rule\u2019s requirements. Accordingly, we reject its\r\ncontention that our application of Rule 50(b) to the instant case is\r\nimpermissibly retroactive. See also Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation,\r\n509 U. S. 86, 97 (1993) (\u201c[W]e can scarcely permit the substantive law to\r\nshift and spring according to the particular equities of individual parties\u2019\r\nclaims of actual reliance on an old rule and of harm from a retroactive\r\napplication of the new rule\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets\r\nomitted)).\r\n   7 We reject respondent\u2019s contention that it is entitled to a remand for\r\n\r\nreconsideration in light of Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F. 3d 1303 (CA\r\nFed. 2005). The Federal Circuit has already denied respondent\u2019s\r\npetition for rehearing raising this issue.\r\n                 Cite as: 546 U.

This is not a\r\ncase, in my view, in which the authority of the appellate\r\ncourt is limited by an explicit statute or controlling rule.\r\nThe spirit of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure favors\r\npreservation of a court\u2019s power to avoid manifestly unjust\r\nresults in exceptional cases.

Moreover, we have an overriding duty to\r\nobey statutory commands that unambiguously express the\r\nintent of Congress even in areas such as procedure in\r\nwhich we may have special expertise.\r\n  Today, relying primarily on a case decided in March\r\n1947, Cone v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co., 330 U. S.\r\n212, and a case decided in January 1948, Globe Liquor Co.\r\nv. San Roman, 332 U. S. 571, the Court holds that the\r\n2   UNITHERM FOOD SYSTEMS, INC. v. SWIFT-ECKRICH, INC.\r\n\r\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nCourt of Appeals was \u201cpowerless\u201d to review the sufficiency\r\nof the evidence supporting the verdict in petitioner\u2019s favor\r\nbecause respondent failed to file proper postverdict mo-\r\ntions pursuant to Rules 50(b) and 59 of the Federal Rules\r\nof Civil Procedure in the trial court. Ante, at 10. The\r\nmajority\u2019s holding is inconsistent with a statute enacted\r\njust months after Globe Liquor was decided. That statute,\r\nwhich remains in effect today, provides:\r\n     \u201cThe Supreme Court or any other court of appellate\r\n     jurisdiction may affirm, modify, vacate, set aside or\r\n     reverse any judgment, decree, or order of a court law-\r\n     fully brought before it for review, and may remand the\r\n     cause and direct the entry of such appropriate judg-\r\n     ment, decree, or order, or require such further pro-\r\n     ceedings to be had as may be just under the circum-\r\n     stances.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72106.\r\n   Nothing in Rule 50(b) limits this statutory grant of\r\npower to appellate courts; while a party\u2019s failure to make a\r\nRule 50(b) motion precludes the district court from direct-\r\ning a verdict in that party\u2019s favor, the Rule does not pur-\r\nport to strip the courts of appeals of the authority to re-\r\nview district court judgments or to order such relief as\r\n\u201cmay be just under the circumstances.\u201d Nor do general\r\nprinciples of waiver or forfeiture have that effect. Cf. ante,\r\nat 9\u201310. It is well settled that a litigant\u2019s waiver or forfei-\r\nture of an argument does not, in the absence of a contrary\r\nstatutory command, preclude the courts of appeals from\r\nconsidering those arguments. See Singleton v. Wulff, 428\r\nU. S. 106, 121 (1976). Arguments raised for the first time on\r\nappeal may be entertained, for example, if their considera-\r\ntion would prevent manifest injustice.

S., at 216, it may be unfair or even an abuse of discre-\r\ntion for a court of appeals to direct a verdict in favor of the\r\nparty that lost below if that party failed to make a timely\r\nRule 50(b) motion. Likewise, it may not be \u201cjust under the\r\ncircumstances\u201d for a court of appeals to order a new trial\r\nin the absence of a proper Rule 59 motion. Finally, a court\r\nof appeals has discretion to rebuff, on grounds of waiver or\r\nforfeiture, a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence\r\nabsent a proper Rule 50(b) or Rule 59 motion made in the\r\ndistrict court.

In this case, however, the respondent filed a Rule 50(a) motion before the verdict, but did not file a Rule 50(b) motion after the verdict. Nor did respondent request a new trial under Rule 59. The Court of Appeals nevertheless proceeded to review the sufficiency of the evidence and, upon a finding that the evidence was insufficient, remanded the case for a new trial. Because our cases addressing the requirements of Rule 50 compel a contrary result, we reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*397</span> I</h2>\n<p>The genesis of the underlying litigation in this case was ConAgra's attempt to enforce its patent for \"A Method for Browning Precooked Whole Muscle Meat Products,\" U.S. Patent No. 5,952,027 ('027 patent). In early 2000, ConAgra issued a general warning to companies who sold equipment and processes for browning precooked meats explaining that it intended to \"`aggressively protect all of [its] rights under [the '027] patent.'\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786979\"><a href=\"/opinion/786979/unitherm-food-systems-inc-and-jennie-o-foods-inc-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1341</span></a></span>, 1344 (CA Fed. 2004). Petitioner Unitherm sold such processes, but did not receive ConAgra's warning. ConAgra also contacted its direct competitors in the precooked meat business, announcing that it was \"`making the '027 Patent and corresponding patents that may issue available for license at a royalty rate of 10\u00a2 per pound.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1345. Jennie-O, a direct competitor, received ConAgra's correspondence and undertook an investigation to determine its rights and responsibilities with regard to the '027 patent. Jennie-O determined that the browning process it had purchased from Unitherm was the same as the process described in the '027 patent. Jennie-O further determined that the '027 patent was invalid because Unitherm's president had invented the process described in that patent six years before ConAgra filed its patent application.</p>\n<p>Consistent with these determinations, Jennie-O and Unitherm jointly sued ConAgra in the Western District of Oklahoma. As relevant here, Jennie-O and Unitherm sought a declaration that the '027 patent was invalid and unenforceable, and alleged that ConAgra had violated \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act, ch. 647, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, by attempting to enforce a patent that was obtained by committing fraud on the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). See <i>Walker Process Equipment, Inc.</i> v. <i>Food Machinery &amp; Chemical Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107122\"><a href=\"/opinion/107122/walker-process-equipment-inc-v-food-machinery-chem/\"><span class=\"volume\">382</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span>, 174 (1965) (holding that \"the enforcement of a patent procured by fraud on the Patent Office may be violative of \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act provided <span class=\"star-pagination\">*398</span> the other elements necessary to a \u00a7 2 case are present\"). The District Court construed the '027 patent and determined that it was invalid based on Unitherm's prior public use and sale of the process described therein. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b). After dismissing Jennie-O for lack of antitrust standing, the District Court allowed Unitherm's <i>Walker Process</i> claim to proceed to trial. Prior to the court's submission of the case to the jury, ConAgra moved for a directed verdict under Rule 50(a) based on legal insufficiency of the evidence. The District Court denied that motion.<sup>[1]</sup> The jury returned a verdict for Unitherm, and ConAgra neither renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(b), nor moved for a new trial on antitrust liability pursuant to Rule 59.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>On appeal to the Federal Circuit, ConAgra maintained that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the jury's <i>Walker Process</i> verdict. Although the Federal Circuit has concluded that a party's \"failure to present the district court with a post-verdict motion precludes appellate review of sufficiency of the evidence,\" <i>Biodex Corp.</i> v. <i>Loredan Biomedical, Inc.,</i> 946 F. 2d 850, 862 (1991), in the instant case it was bound to apply the law of the Tenth Circuit, 375 F.3d, at 1365, n. 7 (\"On most issues related to Rule 50 motions . . . we generally apply regional circuit law unless the precise <span class=\"star-pagination\">*399</span> issue being appealed pertains uniquely to patent law\"). Under Tenth Circuit law, a party that has failed to file a postverdict motion challenging the sufficiency of the evidence may nonetheless raise such a claim on appeal, so long as that party filed a Rule 50(a) motion prior to submission of the case to the jury. <i>Cummings</i> v. <i>General Motors Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785921\"><a href=\"/opinion/785921/gregory-cummings-trace-cummings-husband-and-wife-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></a></span>, 950-951 (2004). Notably, the only available relief in such a circumstance is a new trial. <i>Id.,</i> at 951.</p>\n<p>Freed to examine the sufficiency of the evidence, the Federal Circuit concluded that, although Unitherm had presented sufficient evidence to support a determination that ConAgra had attempted to enforce a patent that it had obtained through fraud on the PTO, 375 F.3d, at 1362, Unitherm had failed to present evidence sufficient to support the remaining elements of its antitrust claim. <i>Id.,</i> at 1365 (\"Unitherm failed to present any economic evidence capable of sustaining its asserted relevant antitrust market, and little to support any other aspect of its Section 2 claim\"). Accordingly, it vacated the jury's judgment in favor of Unitherm and remanded for a new trial. We granted certiorari, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1186</span></span> (2005), and now reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 sets forth the procedural requirements for challenging the sufficiency of the evidence in a civil jury trial and establishes two stages for such challenges\u0097prior to submission of the case to the jury, and after the verdict and entry of judgment. Rule 50(a) allows a party to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence prior to submission of the case to the jury, and authorizes the district court to grant such motions at the court's discretion:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(a) JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) If during a trial by jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue, the court may determine the issue against <span class=\"star-pagination\">*400</span> that party and may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against that party with respect to a claim or defense that cannot under the controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) Motions for judgment as a matter of law may be made at any time before submission of the case to the jury. Such a motion shall specify the judgment sought and the law and the facts on which the moving party is entitled to the judgment.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Rule 50(b), by contrast, sets forth the procedural requirements for renewing a sufficiency of the evidence challenge after the jury verdict and entry of judgment.</p>\n<blockquote>\"(b) RENEWING MOTION FOR JUDGMENT AFTER TRIAL; ALTERNATIVE MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL. If, for any reason, the court does not grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of all the evidence, the court is considered to have submitted the action to the jury subject to the court's later deciding the legal questions raised by the motion. The movant may renew its request for judgment as a matter of law by filing a motion no later than 10 days after entry of judgment\u0097and may alternatively request a new trial or join a motion for a new trial under Rule 59. In ruling on a renewed motion, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) if a verdict was returned:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(A) allow the judgment to stand,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(B) order a new trial, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(C) direct entry of judgment as a matter of law....\"</blockquote>\n<p>This Court has addressed the implications of a party's failure to file a postverdict motion under Rule 50(b) on several occasions and in a variety of procedural contexts. This Court has concluded that, \"[i]n the absence of such a motion\" an \"appellate court [is] without power to direct the District <span class=\"star-pagination\">*401</span> Court to enter judgment contrary to the one it had permitted to stand.\" <i>Cone</i> v. <i>West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104381\"><a href=\"/opinion/104381/cone-v-west-virginia-pulp-paper-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span>, 218 (1947). This Court has similarly concluded that a party's failure to file a Rule 50(b) motion deprives the appellate court of the power to order the entry of judgment in favor of that party where the district court directed the jury's verdict, <i>Globe Liquor Co.</i> v. <i>San Roman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104488\"><a href=\"/opinion/104488/globe-liquor-co-v-san-roman/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span> (1948), and where the district court expressly reserved a party's preverdict motion for a directed verdict and then denied that motion after the verdict was returned, <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105040\"><a href=\"/opinion/105040/johnson-v-new-york-nh-hr-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span> (1952). A postverdict motion is necessary because \"[d]etermination of whether a new trial should be granted or a judgment entered under Rule 50(b) calls for the judgment in the first instance of the judge who saw and heard the witnesses and has the feel of the case which no appellate printed transcript can impart.\"<sup>[3]</sup><i>Cone, supra,</i> at 216. Moreover, the \"requirement of a timely application for judgment after verdict is not an idle motion\" because it \"is . . . an essential part of the rule, firmly grounded in principles of fairness.\" <i>Johnson, supra,</i> at 53.</p>\n<p>The foregoing authorities lead us to reverse the judgment below. Respondent correctly points out that these authorities address whether an appellate court may enter judgment in the absence of a postverdict motion, as opposed to whether an appellate court may order a new trial (as the Federal Circuit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*402</span> did here). But this distinction is immaterial. This Court's observations about the necessity of a postverdict motion under Rule 50(b), and the benefits of the district court's input at that stage, apply with equal force whether a party is seeking judgment as a matter of law or simply a new trial. In <i>Cone,</i> this Court concluded that, because Rule 50(b) permits the district court to exercise its discretion to choose between ordering a new trial and entering judgment, its \"appraisal of the bona fides of the claims asserted by the litigants is of great value in reaching a conclusion as to whether a <i>new trial</i> should be granted.\" 330 U.S., at 216 (emphasis added). Similarly, this Court has determined that a party may only pursue on appeal a particular avenue of relief available under Rule 50(b), namely, the entry of judgment <i>or a new trial,</i> when that party has complied with the Rule's filing requirements by requesting that particular relief below. See <i>Johnson, supra,</i> at 54 (\"Respondent made a motion to set aside the verdict and for new trial within the time required by Rule 50(b). It failed to comply with permission given by 50(b) to move for judgment <i>n. o. v.</i> after the verdict. In this situation respondent is entitled only to a new trial, not to a judgment in its favor\").<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*403</span> Despite the straightforward language employed in <i>Cone, Globe Liquor,</i> and <i>Johnson,</i> respondent maintains that those cases dictate affirmance here, because in each of those cases the litigants secured a new trial. But in each of those cases the appellants moved for a new trial postverdict in the District Court, and did not seek to establish their entitlement to a new trial solely on the basis of a denied Rule 50(a) motion. See <i>Cone, supra,</i> at 213 (noting that respondent moved for a new trial);<sup>[5]</sup><i>Globe Liquor, supra,</i> at 572 (\"The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*404</span> respondents . . . moved for a new trial on the ground . . . that there were many contested issues of fact\"). Indeed, <i>Johnson</i> concluded that respondent was <i>only</i> entitled to a new trial by virtue of its motion for such \"within the time required by Rule 50(b).\" 344 U.S., at 54. Accordingly, these outcomes merely underscore our holding today\u0097a party is not entitled to pursue a new trial on appeal unless that party makes an appropriate postverdict motion in the district court.</p>\n<p>Our determination that respondent's failure to comply with Rule 50(b) forecloses its challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is further validated by the purported basis of respondent's appeal, namely, the District Court's denial of respondent's preverdict Rule 50(a) motion. As an initial matter, <i>Cone, Globe Liquor,</i> and <i>Johnson</i> unequivocally establish that the precise subject matter of a party's Rule 50(a) motion\u0097namely, its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law\u0097cannot be appealed unless that motion is renewed pursuant to Rule 50(b). Here, respondent does not seek to pursue on appeal the precise claim it raised in its Rule 50(a) motion before the District Court\u0097namely, its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. Rather, it seeks a <i>new trial</i> based on the legal insufficiency of the evidence. But if, as in <i>Cone, Globe Liquor,</i> and <i>Johnson,</i> a litigant that has failed to file a Rule 50(b) motion is foreclosed from seeking the relief it sought in its Rule 50(a) motion\u0097<i>i. e.,</i> the entry of judgment\u0097then surely respondent is foreclosed from seeking a new trial, relief it did not and could not seek in its preverdict motion. In short, respondent never sought a new trial before the District Court, and thus forfeited its right to do so on appeal. <i>Yakus</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103950\"><a href=\"/opinion/103950/yakus-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">414</span></a></span>, 444 (1944) (\"No procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a . . . right may be forfeited . . . by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*405</span> failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it\").</p>\n<p>The text of Rule 50(b) confirms that respondent's preverdict Rule 50(a) motion did not present the District Court with the option of ordering a new trial. That text provides that a district court may only order a new trial on the basis of issues raised in a preverdict Rule 50(a) motion when \"ruling on a renewed motion\" under Rule 50(b). Accordingly, even if the District Court was inclined to grant a new trial on the basis of arguments raised in respondent's preverdict motion, it was without the power to do so under Rule 50(b) absent a postverdict motion pursuant to that Rule. Consequently, the Court of Appeals was similarly powerless.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the text and application of Rule 50(a) support our determination that respondent may not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal on the basis of the District Court's denial of its Rule 50(a) motion. The Rule provides that \"the court <i>may</i> determine\" that \"there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for [a] party on [a given] issue,\" and \"<i>may</i> grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against that party . . . .\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, while a district court is permitted to enter judgment as a matter of law when it concludes that the evidence is legally insufficient, it is not required to do so. To the contrary, the district courts are, if anything, encouraged to submit the case to the jury, rather than granting such motions. As Wright and Miller explain:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Even at the close of all the evidence it may be desirable to refrain from granting a motion for judgment as a matter of law despite the fact that it would be possible for the district court to do so. If judgment as a matter of law is granted and the appellate court holds that the evidence in fact was sufficient to go to the jury, an entire new trial must be had. If, on the other hand, the trial court submits the case to the jury, though it thinks the evidence insufficient, final determination of the case is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*406</span> expedited greatly. If the jury agrees with the court's appraisal of the evidence, and returns a verdict for the party who moved for judgment as a matter of law, the case is at an end. If the jury brings in a different verdict, the trial court can grant a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law. Then if the appellate court holds that the trial court was in error in its appraisal of the evidence, it can reverse and order judgment on the verdict of the jury, without any need for a new trial. For this reason the appellate courts repeatedly have said that it usually is desirable to take a verdict, and then pass on the sufficiency of the evidence on a post-verdict motion.\" 9A Federal Practice \u00a7 2533, at 319 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, the District Court's denial of respondent's preverdict motion cannot form the basis of respondent's appeal, because the denial of that motion was not error. It was merely an exercise of the District Court's discretion, in accordance with the text of the Rule and the accepted practice of permitting the jury to make an initial judgment about the sufficiency of the evidence. The only error here was counsel's failure to file a postverdict motion pursuant to Rule 50(b).<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*407</span> * * *</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we hold that since respondent failed to renew its preverdict motion as specified in Rule 50(b), there was no basis for review of respondent's sufficiency of the evidence challenge in the Court of Appeals. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Murphy's law applies to trial lawyers as well as pilots. Even an expert will occasionally blunder. For that reason Congress has preserved the federal appeals courts' power to correct plain error, even though trial counsel's omission will ordinarily give rise to a binding waiver. This is not a case, in my view, in which the authority of the appellate court is limited by an explicit statute or controlling rule. The spirit of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure favors preservation of a court's power to avoid manifestly unjust results in exceptional cases. See <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105040\"><a href=\"/opinion/105040/johnson-v-new-york-nh-hr-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 62 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) (\"`Procedure is the means; full, equal and exact enforcement of substantive law is the end'\" (quoting Pound, The Etiquette of Justice, 3 Proceedings Neb. St. Bar Assn. 231 (1909))). Moreover, we have an overriding duty to obey statutory commands that unambiguously express the intent of Congress even in areas such as procedure in which we may have special expertise.</p>\n<p>Today, relying primarily on a case decided in March 1947, <i>Cone</i> v. <i>West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104381\"><a href=\"/opinion/104381/cone-v-west-virginia-pulp-paper-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span>, and a case decided in January 1948, <i>Globe Liquor Co.</i> v. <i>San</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*408</span> <i>Roman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104488\"><a href=\"/opinion/104488/globe-liquor-co-v-san-roman/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span>, the Court holds that the Court of Appeals was \"powerless\" to review the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the verdict in petitioner's favor because respondent failed to file proper postverdict motions pursuant to Rules 50(b) and 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in the trial court. <i>Ante,</i> at 405. The majority's holding is inconsistent with a statute enacted just months after <i>Globe Liquor</i> was decided. That statute, which remains in effect today, provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The Supreme Court or any other court of appellate jurisdiction may affirm, modify, vacate, set aside or reverse any judgment, decree, or order of a court lawfully brought before it for review, and may remand the cause and direct the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106.</blockquote>\n<p>Nothing in Rule 50(b) limits this statutory grant of power to appellate courts; while a party's failure to make a Rule 50(b) motion precludes the <i>district court</i> from directing a verdict in that party's favor, the Rule does not purport to strip the courts of appeals of the authority to review district court judgments or to order such relief as \"may be just under the circumstances.\" Nor do general principles of waiver or forfeiture have that effect. Cf. <i>ante,</i> at 404-405. It is well settled that a litigant's waiver or forfeiture of an argument does not, in the absence of a contrary statutory command, preclude the courts of appeals from considering those arguments. See <i>Singleton</i> v. <i>Wulff,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109530\"><a href=\"/opinion/109530/singleton-v-wulff/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span>, 121 (1976). Arguments raised for the first time on appeal may be entertained, for example, if their consideration would prevent manifest injustice. <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*409</span> For the reasons articulated by the Court in <i>Cone,</i> 330 U.S., at 216, it may be unfair or even an abuse of discretion for a court of appeals to direct a verdict in favor of the party that lost below if that party failed to make a timely Rule 50(b) motion. Likewise, it may not be \"just under the circumstances\" for a court of appeals to order a new trial in the absence of a proper Rule 59 motion. Finally, a court of appeals has discretion to rebuff, on grounds of waiver or forfeiture, a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence absent a proper Rule 50(b) or Rule 59 motion made in the district court. None of the foregoing propositions rests, however, on a determination that the courts of appeals lack \"power\" to review the sufficiency of the evidence and order appropriate relief under these circumstances, and I can divine no basis for that determination.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Petitioner contends that respondent's Rule 50(a) motion pertained only to the fraud element of petitioner's <i>Walker Process</i> claim, and that it did not encompass the remaining antitrust elements of that claim. Because we conclude that petitioner is entitled to prevail irrespective of the scope of respondent's Rule 50(a) motion, we assume without deciding that that motion pertained to all aspects of petitioner's \u00a7 2 claim. But see Amendments to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 134 F. R. D. 525, 687 (1991) (\"A post-trial motion for judgment can be granted only on grounds advanced in the pre-verdict motion\").</p>\n<p>[2]  While ConAgra did file a postverdict motion seeking a new trial on antitrust damages, that motion did not seek to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence establishing antitrust liability and thus has no bearing on the instant case.</p>\n<p>[3]  Neither <i>Neely</i> v. <i>Martin K.

In those cases this Court determined that an appellate court may, in certain circumstances, direct the entry of judgment when it reverses the district court's denial of a Rule 50(b) motion. But in such circumstances the district court will have had an opportunity to consider the propriety of entering judgment or ordering a new trial by virtue of the postverdict motion. Moreover, these cases reiterate the value of the district court's input, cautioning the courts of appeals to be \"`constantly alert' to `the trial judge's first-hand knowledge of witnesses, testimony, and issues.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 443 (quoting <i>Neely, supra,</i> at 325).</p>\n<p>[4]  The dissent's suggestion that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 permits the courts of appeals to consider the sufficiency of the evidence underlying a civil jury verdict notwithstanding a party's failure to comply with Rule 50 is foreclosed by authority of this Court.

Johnson</i> explicitly reaffirmed those earlier cases, concluding that \"in the absence of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict made in the trial court within ten days after reception of a verdict [Rule 50] forbids the trial judge or an appellate court to enter such a judgment.\" 344 U.S., at 50. Moreover, in <i>Neely,</i> this Court observed that \u00a7 2106 is \"broad enough to include the power to direct entry of judgment <i>n. o. v.</i> on appeal,\" 386 U.S., at 322, but nonetheless reaffirmed that <i>Cone, Globe Liquor,</i> and <i>Johnson</i> \"make it clear that an appellate court may not order judgment <i>n. o. v.</i> where the verdict loser has failed strictly to comply with the procedural requirements of Rule 50(b),\" 386 U.S., at 325. Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, <i>Neely</i> confirms that the broad grant of authority to the courts of appeals in \u00a7 2106 must be exercised consistent with the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as interpreted by this Court.\n</p>\n<p>The dissent's approach is not only foreclosed by authority of this Court, it also may present Seventh Amendment concerns. The implication of the dissent's interpretation of \u00a7 2106 is that a court of appeals would be free to examine the sufficiency of the evidence regardless of whether the appellant had filed a Rule 50(a) motion in the district court and, in the event the appellant had filed a Rule 50(a) motion, regardless of whether the district court had ever <i>ruled</i> on that motion. The former is squarely foreclosed by <i>Slocum</i> v. <i>New York Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97856\"><a href=\"/opinion/97856/slocum-v-new-york-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span> (1913), and the latter is inconsistent with this Court's explanation of the requirements of the Seventh Amendment in <i>Baltimore &amp; Carolina Line, Inc.</i> v. <i>Redman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102480\"><a href=\"/opinion/102480/baltimore-carolina-line-inc-v-redman/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">654</span></a></span>, 658 (1935) (explaining that \"under the pertinent rules of the common law the court of appeals could set aside the verdict for error of law, such as the trial court's <i>ruling</i> respecting the sufficiency of the evidence, and direct a new trial, but could not itself determine the issues of fact and direct a judgment for the defendant, for this would cut off the plaintiff's unwaived right to have the issues of fact determined by a jury\" (emphasis added)). Indeed, Rule 50 was drafted with such concerns in mind. See 9A C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2522, pp. 244-246 (2d ed. 1995) (hereinafter Federal Practice).</p>\n<p>[5]  While the precise nature of the new trial motion at issue in <i>Cone</i> is difficult to ascertain from this Court's description of that motion, the Court of Appeals opinion in that case confirms that the movant had properly objected to the admission of certain evidence, and then moved postverdict \"for a new trial [on the basis of the inadmissible evidence] and later renewed this motion upon the basis of newly-discovered evidence.\" <i>West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper Co.</i> v. <i>Cone,</i> 153 F. 2d 576, 580 (CA4 1946). This Court did not disturb the Court of Appeals' holding that formed the basis of the movant's entitlement to a new trial, namely, \"the Circuit Court of Appeals' holding that there was prejudicial error in the admission of evidence.\" 330 U.S., at 215.</p>\n<p>[6]  Respondent claims that its failure to renew its Rule 50(a) motion was in reliance on the Tenth Circuit's determination that it could order a new trial in the absence of a Rule 50(b) motion. But respondent cannot credibly maintain that it wanted the Court of Appeals to order a new trial as opposed to entering judgment. And, as the Tenth Circuit has recognized, respondent could not obtain the entry of judgment unless it complied with Rule 50(b). <i>Cummings</i> v. <i>General Motors Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785921\"><a href=\"/opinion/785921/gregory-cummings-trace-cummings-husband-and-wife-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></a></span>, 951 (2004). Respondent therefore had every incentive to comply with that Rule's requirements. Accordingly, we reject its contention that our application of Rule 50(b) to the instant case is impermissibly retroactive. See also <i>Harper</i> v. <i>Virginia Dept. of Taxation,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112890\"><a href=\"/opinion/112890/harper-v-virginia-dept-of-taxation/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 97 (1993) (\"[W]e can scarcely permit the substantive law to shift and spring according to the particular equities of individual parties' claims of actual reliance on an old rule and of harm from a retroactive application of the new rule\" (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).</p>\n<p>[7]  We reject respondent's contention that it is entitled to a remand for reconsideration in light of <i>Phillips</i> v. <i>AWH Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1303</span></span> (CA Fed. 2005). The Federal Circuit has already denied respondent's petition for rehearing raising this issue.</p>\n<p>[*]  The Court suggests that the Seventh Amendment limits appellate courts' power to review judgments under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106. See <i>ante,</i> at 402-403, n. 4. I disagree with the Court's analysis in two respects. First, although the right to trial by jury might be implicated if no Rule 50(a) motion had been made, such a motion <i>was</i> made in this case. The Rule 50(a) motion triggered the automatic reservation of \"legal questions,\" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 50(b), and that reservation, in turn, averted any Seventh Amendment problem, see <i>Baltimore &amp; Carolina Line, Inc.</i> v. <i>Redman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102480\"><a href=\"/opinion/102480/baltimore-carolina-line-inc-v-redman/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">654</span></a></span> (1935). Second, the Seventh Amendment imposes no greater restriction on appellate courts than it does on district courts in these circumstances; \"[a]s far as the Seventh Amendment's right to jury trial is concerned, there is no greater restriction on the province of the jury when an appellate court enters judgment <i>n. o. v.</i> than when a trial court does.\" <i>Neely</i> v. <i>Martin K. Eby Constr. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></span>, 322 (1967).</p>\n\n</div>",
