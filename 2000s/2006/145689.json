With him on the brief were <i>Solicitor General Clement, Assistant Attorney General Keisler, Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler,</i> and <i>Barbara L. Herwig.</i></p>\n<p><i>Allison M.

The issue here is whether a refusal to apply the judgment bar of the Federal Tort Claims Act is open to collateral appeal. We hold it is not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The complaint alleges that Susan Hallock owned a computer software business that she and her husband, Richard, operated from home. After information about Richard Hallock's credit card was stolen and used to pay the subscription fee for a child pornography Web site, agents of the United States Customs Service, investigating the Web site, traced <span class=\"star-pagination\">*348</span> the payment to Richard Hallock's card and got a warrant to search the Hallocks' residence. With that authority, they seized the Hallocks' computer equipment, software, and disk drives. No criminal charges were ever brought, but the Government's actions produced a different disaster. When the computer equipment was returned, several of the disk drives were damaged, all of the stored data (including trade secrets and account files) were lost, and the Hallocks were forced out of business.</p>\n<p>In July 2002, Susan Hallock and her company brought an action against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, invoking the waiver of sovereign immunity, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346, and alleging negligence by the customs agents in executing the search. The merits of the claim were never addressed, for the District Court granted the Government's motion to dismiss, holding that the agents' activities occurred in the course of detaining goods and thus fell within an exception to the Act's waiver of sovereign immunity, \u00a7 2680(e). <i>Hallock</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 253 F. Supp. 2d 361 (NDNY 2003).</p>\n<p>While the suit against the Government was still pending, Susan Hallock filed this action against the individual agents under <i>Bivens</i> v. <i>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</i> 403 U.S. 388 (1971), alleging in her complaint that the agents had damaged her computers and thus deprived her of property including business income in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. After the District Court dismissed the first suit against the Government, the agents moved for judgment in the <i>Bivens</i> action, citing the judgment bar of the Tort Claims Act, that \"the judgment in an action under [\u00a7] 1346(b) of this title shall constitute a complete bar to any action by the claimant, by reason of the same subject matter, against the employee of the government whose act or omission gave rise to the claim.\" \u00a7 2676.</p>\n<p>The District Court denied the motion, holding that dismissal of the action against the Government under the Tort <span class=\"star-pagination\">*349</span> Claims Act was solely on a procedural ground, and thus failed to raise the judgment bar. <i>Hallock</i> v. <i>Bonner,</i> 281 F. Supp. 2d 425, 427 (NDNY 2003). The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, after first finding jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine. <i>Hallock</i> v. <i>Bonner,</i> 387 F.3d 147 (2004). We granted certiorari to consider the judgment bar, 545 U.S. 1103 (2005), but now vacate for want of appellate jurisdiction on the part of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The collateral order doctrine, identified with <i>Cohen</i> v. <i>Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.,</i> 337 U.S. 541 (1949), is \"best understood not as an exception to the `final decision' rule laid down by Congress in \u00a7 1291, but as a `practical construction' of it.\" <i>Digital Equipment, supra,</i> at 867 (quoting <i>Cohen, supra,</i> at 546). Whereas 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 \"gives courts of appeals jurisdiction over `all final decisions' of district courts\" that are not directly appealable to us, <i>Behrens</i> v. <i>Pelletier,</i> 516 U.S. 299, 305 (1996), the collateral order doctrine accommodates a \"small class\" of rulings, not concluding the litigation, but conclusively resolving \"claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action,\" <i>ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). The claims are \"too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\" <i>Cohen, supra,</i> at 546.</p>\n<p>The requirements for collateral order appeal have been distilled down to three conditions: that an order \"`[1] conclusively determine the disputed question, [2] resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and [3] be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.'\" <i>Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority</i> v. <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.,</i> 506 U.S. 139, 144 (1993) (quoting <i>Coopers &amp; Lybrand</i> v. <i>Livesay,</i> 437 U.S. 463, 468 (1978)). The conditions are \"stringent,\" <i>Digital Equipment, supra,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*350</span> at 868 (citing <i>Midland Asphalt Corp.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 489 U.S. 794, 799 (1989)), and unless they are kept so, the underlying doctrine will overpower the substantial finality interests \u00a7 1291 is meant to further: judicial efficiency, for example, and the \"sensible policy `of avoid[ing] the obstruction to just claims that would come from permitting the harassment and cost of a succession of separate appeals from the various rulings to which a litigation may give rise.'\" <i>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</i> v. <i>Risjord,</i> 449 U.S. 368, 374 (1981) (quoting <i>Cobbledick</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 309 U.S. 323, 325 (1940)).</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we have not mentioned applying the collateral order doctrine recently without emphasizing its modest scope. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Digital Equipment,</i> 511 U.S., at 868 (\"[T]he `narrow' exception should stay that way and never be allowed to swallow the general rule that a party is entitled to a single appeal, to be deferred until final judgment has been entered ...\" (citation omitted)). And we have meant what we have said; although the Court has been asked many times to expand the \"small class\" of collaterally appealable orders, we have instead kept it narrow and selective in its membership.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Prior cases mark the line between rulings within the class and those outside. On the immediately appealable side are orders rejecting absolute immunity, <i>Nixon</i> v. <i>Fitzgerald,</i> 457 U.S. 731, 742 (1982), and qualified immunity, <i>Mitchell</i> v. <i>Forsyth,</i> 472 U.S. 511, 530 (1985). A State has the benefit of the doctrine to appeal a decision denying its claim to Eleventh Amendment immunity, <i>Puerto Rico Aqueduct, supra,</i> at 144-145, and a criminal defendant may collaterally appeal an adverse ruling on a defense of double jeopardy, <i>Abney</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 431 U.S. 651, 660 (1977).</p>\n<p>The examples admittedly raise the lawyer's temptation to generalize. In each case, the collaterally appealing party was vindicating or claiming a right to avoid trial, in satisfaction of the third condition: unless the order to stand trial was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*351</span> immediately appealable, the right would be effectively lost. Those seeking immediate appeal therefore naturally argue that any order denying a claim of right to prevail without trial satisfies the third condition. But this generalization is too easy to be sound and, if accepted, would leave the final order requirement of \u00a7 1291 in tatters. We faced this prospect in <i>Digital Equipment, supra,</i> an appeal from an order rescinding a settlement agreement. Petitioner asserted a \"`right not to stand trial' requiring protection by way of immediate appeal,\" analogizing the rescission to a denial of immunity. <i>Id.,</i> at 869. We said no, however, lest \"every right that could be enforced appropriately by pretrial dismissal [be] loosely . . . described as conferring a `right not to stand trial.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 873. Otherwise, \"almost every pretrial or trial order might be called `effectively unreviewable' in the sense that relief from error can never extend to rewriting history.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 872.</p>\n<blockquote>\"Allowing immediate appeals to vindicate every such right would move \u00a7 1291 aside for claims that the district court lacks personal jurisdiction, that the statute of limitations has run, that the movant has been denied his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, that an action is barred on claim preclusion principles, that no material fact is in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, or merely that the complaint fails to state a claim. Such motions can be made in virtually every case.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 873 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Since only some orders denying an asserted right to avoid the burdens of trial qualify, then, as orders that cannot be reviewed \"effectively\" after a conventional final judgment, the cases have to be combed for some further characteristic that merits appealability under <i>Cohen;</i> and as <i>Digital Equipment</i> explained, that something further boils down to \"a judgment about the value of the interests that would be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*352</span> lost through rigorous application of a final judgment requirement.\" 511 U.S., at 878-879 (citing <i>Van Cauwenberghe</i> v. <i>Biard,</i> 486 U.S. 517, 524 (1988)). See also <i>Lauro Lines s.r.l.</i> v. <i>Chasser,</i> 490 U.S. 495, 502 (1989) (SCALIA, J., concurring) (\"The importance of the right asserted has always been a significant part of our collateral order doctrine\").</p>\n<p>Thus, in <i>Nixon, supra,</i> we stressed the \"compelling public ends,\" <i>id.,</i> at 758, \"rooted in . . . the separation of powers,\" <i>id.,</i> at 749, that would be compromised by failing to allow immediate appeal of a denial of absolute Presidential immunity, <i>id.,</i> at 743, 752, n. 32. In explaining collateral order treatment when a qualified immunity claim was at issue in <i>Mitchell, supra,</i> we spoke of the threatened disruption of governmental functions, and fear of inhibiting able people from exercising discretion in public service if a full trial were threatened whenever they acted reasonably in the face of law that is not \"clearly established.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 526. <i>Puerto Rico Aqueduct,</i> 506 U.S. 139, explained the immediate appealability of an order denying a claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity by adverting not only to the burdens of litigation but to the need to ensure vindication of a State's dignitary interests. <i>Id.,</i> at 146. And although the double jeopardy claim given <i>Cohen</i> treatment in <i>Abney, supra,</i> did not implicate a right to be free of all proceedings whatsoever (since prior jeopardy is essential to the defense), we described the enormous prosecutorial power of the Government to subject an individual \"to embarrassment, expense and ordeal . . . compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety,\" <i>id.,</i> at 661-662 (internal quotation marks omitted); the only way to alleviate these consequences of the Government's superior position was by collateral order appeal.</p>\n<p>In each case, some particular value of a high order was marshaled in support of the interest in avoiding trial: honoring the separation of powers, preserving the efficiency of government and the initiative of its officials, respecting a State's dignitary interests, and mitigating the government's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*353</span> advantage over the individual. That is, it is not mere avoidance of a trial, but avoidance of a trial that would imperil a substantial public interest, that counts when asking whether an order is \"effectively\" unreviewable if review is to be left until later. <i>Coopers &amp; Lybrand,</i> 437 U.S., at 468 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Does the claim of the customs agents in this case serve such a weighty public objective that the judgment bar should be treated as an immunity demanding the protection of a collateral order appeal? One can argue, of course, that if the <i>Bivens</i> action goes to trial the efficiency of Government will be compromised and the officials burdened and distracted, as in the qualified immunity case: if qualified immunity gets <i>Cohen</i> treatment, so should the judgment bar to further litigation in the aftermath of the Government's success under the Tort Claims Act. But the cases are different. Qualified immunity is not the law simply to save trouble for the Government and its employees; it is recognized because the burden of trial is unjustified in the face of a colorable claim that the law on point was not clear when the official took action, and the action was reasonable in light of the law as it was. The nub of qualified immunity is the need to induce officials to show reasonable initiative when the relevant law is not \"clearly established,\" <i>Harlow</i> v. <i>Fitzgerald,</i> 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982); cf. <i>Saucier</i> v. <i>Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 202 (2001); a quick resolution of a qualified immunity claim is essential.</p>\n<p>There is, however, no such public interest at stake simply because the judgment bar is said to be applicable. It is not the preservation of initiative but the avoidance of litigation for its own sake that supports the judgment bar, and if simply abbreviating litigation troublesome to Government employees were important enough for <i>Cohen</i> treatment, collateral order appeal would be a matter of right whenever the Government lost a motion to dismiss under the Tort <span class=\"star-pagination\">*354</span> Claims Act, or a federal officer lost one on a <i>Bivens</i> action, or a state official was in that position in a case under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, or <i>Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U.S. 123 (1908). In effect, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 would fade out whenever the Government or an official lost an early round that could have ended the fight.</p>\n<p>Another difference between qualified immunity and the judgment bar lies in the bar's essential procedural element. While a qualified immunity claim is timely from the moment an official is served with a complaint, the judgment bar can be raised only after a case under the Tort Claims Act has been resolved in the Government's favor. If a <i>Bivens</i> action alone is brought, there will be no possibility of a judgment bar, nor will there be so long as a <i>Bivens</i> action against officials and a Tort Claims Act against the Government are pending simultaneously (as they were for a time here). In the present case, if Susan Hallock had brought her <i>Bivens</i> action and no other, the agents could not possibly have invoked the judgment bar in claiming a right to be free of trial. The closer analogy to the judgment bar, then, is not immunity but the defense of claim preclusion, or res judicata.</p>\n<p>Although the statutory judgment bar is arguably broader than traditional res judicata, it functions in much the same way, with both rules depending on a prior judgment as a condition precedent<sup>[*]</sup> and neither reflecting a policy that a defendant should be scot free of any liability. The concern behind both rules is a different one, of avoiding duplicative litigation, \"multiple suits on identical entitlements or obligations between the same parties.\" 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; <span class=\"star-pagination\">*355</span> E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4402, p. 9 (2d ed. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). But this rule of respecting a prior judgment by giving a defense against relitigation has not been thought to protect values so great that only immediate appeal can effectively vindicate them. As we indicated in <i>Digital Equipment,</i> in the usual case, absent particular reasons for discretionary appeal by leave of the trial court, a defense of claim preclusion is fairly subordinated to the general policy of deferring appellate review to the moment of final judgment. 511 U.S., at 873.</p>\n<p>The judgment bar at issue in this case has no claim to greater importance than the typical defense of claim preclusion; and we hold true to form in deciding what <i>Digital Equipment</i> implied, that an order rejecting the defense of judgment bar under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2676 cries for no immediate appeal of right as a collateral order.</p>\n<p>We vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case with instructions to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The right to be free of double jeopardy is subject to an analogous condition, that jeopardy have attached in a prior proceeding, <i>Monge</i> v. <i>California,</i> 524 U.S. 721, 728 (1998), a characteristic that distinguishes the Fifth Amendment right from other immunities mentioned above. But, as we explained, double jeopardy deserves immunity treatment under \u00a7 1291 owing to the enormous advantage of a Government prosecutor who chooses to go repeatedly against an individual.</p>\n\n</div>",

HALLOCK ET AL.\r\n\r\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\r\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\r\n\r\nNo. 04\u20131332. Argued November 28, 2005\u2014Decided January 18, 2006\r\nIn a warranted search of Susan and Richard Hallocks\u2019 residence, Cus-\r\n  toms Service agents seized computer equipment, software, and disk\r\n  drives. No criminal charges were ever brought, but the equipment\r\n  was returned damaged, with all of the stored data lost, forcing Susan\r\n  to close her computer software business. She sued the United States\r\n  under the Federal Tort Claims Act, invoking the waiver of sovereign\r\n  immunity, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71346, and alleging negligence by the customs\r\n  agents in executing the search. While that suit was pending, Susan\r\n  also filed this action against the individual agents under Bivens v.\r\n  Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, alleging that the\r\n  damage they caused to her computers deprived her of property in vio-\r\n  lation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. After the Dis-\r\n  trict Court dismissed the first suit on the ground that the agents\u2019 ac-\r\n  tivities fell within an exception to the Tort Claims Act\u2019s waiver of\r\n  sovereign immunity, \u00a72680(e), the agents moved for judgment in the\r\n  Bivens action. They relied on the Tort Claims Act\u2019s judgment bar,\r\n  \u00a72676, which provides that \u201cthe judgment in an action under 1346(b)\r\n  . . . constitute[s] a complete bar to any action . . . against the em-\r\n  ployee of the government whose act or omission gave rise to the\r\n  claim.\u201d The District Court denied the motion, holding that dismissal\r\n  of the Tort Claims Act suit against the Government failed to raise the\r\n  Act\u2019s judgment bar. The Second Circuit affirmed, after first ruling in\r\n  favor of jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine. Under this\r\n  doctrine, appellate authority to review \u201call final decisions of the dis-\r\n  trict courts,\u201d \u00a71291, includes jurisdiction over \u201ca narrow class of deci-\r\n  sions that do not terminate the litigation,\u201d but are sufficiently impor-\r\n  tant and collateral to the merits that they should \u201cnonetheless be\r\n  treated as \u2018final,\u2019 \u201d Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511\r\n2                         WILL v. HALLOCK\r\n\r\n                                Syllabus\r\n\r\n    U. S. 863, 867.\r\nHeld: A refusal to apply the Federal Tort Claims Act\u2019s judgment bar is\r\n not open to collateral appeal. Pp. 4\u20139.\r\n    (a) Three conditions are required for collateral appeal: the order\r\n must \u201c[1] conclusively determine the disputed question; [2] resolve an\r\n important issue completely separate from the merits . . . , and [3] be\r\n effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d Puerto\r\n Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S.\r\n 139, 144. Those conditions are \u201cstringent.\u201d Digital Equipment, su-\r\n pra, at 868. Unless they are kept so, the underlying doctrine will\r\n overpower the substantial finality interests \u00a71291 is meant to fur-\r\n ther. Pp. 3\u20134.\r\n    (b) Among the \u201csmall class\u201d of orders this Court has held to be col-\r\n laterally appealable are those rejecting absolute immunity, Nixon v.\r\n Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 742, qualified immunity, Mitchell v. For-\r\n syth, 472 U. S. 511, 530, and a State\u2019s Eleventh Amendment immu-\r\n nity claim, Puerto Rico Aqueduct, supra, at 144\u2013145. In each of these\r\n cases, the collaterally appealing party was vindicating or claiming a\r\n right to avoid trial, in satisfaction of the third condition: unless the\r\n order to stand trial was immediately appealable the right would be\r\n effectively lost. However, to accept the generalization that any order\r\n denying a claim of right to prevail without trial satisfies the third\r\n condition would leave \u00a71291\u2019s final order requirement in tatters. See\r\n Digital Equipment, supra, at 872\u2013873. Pp. 4\u20135.\r\n    (c) Thus, only some orders denying an asserted right to avoid the\r\n burdens of trial qualify as orders that cannot be reviewed \u201ceffec-\r\n tively\u201d after a conventional final judgment. The further characteris-\r\n tic that merits collateral appealability is \u201ca judgment about the value\r\n of the interests that would be lost through rigorous application of the\r\n final judgment requirement.\u201d Digital Equipment, supra, at 878\u2013879.\r\n In each case finding appealability, some particular value of a high\r\n order was marshaled in support of the interest in avoiding trial, e.g.,\r\n honoring the separation of powers, Nixon, supra, at 749, 758, pre-\r\n serving the efficiency of government and the initiative of its officials,\r\n Mitchell, supra, at 526, and respecting a State\u2019s dignitary interests,\r\n Puerto Rico Aqueduct, supra, at 146. It is not mere avoidance of a\r\n trial, but avoidance of a trial that would imperil a substantial public\r\n interest that counts. Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463,\r\n 468. Pp. 5\u20137.\r\n    (d) The customs agents\u2019 claim here does not serve a weighty public\r\n objective. This case must be distinguished from qualified immunity\r\n cases. The nub of such immunity is the need to induce government\r\n officials to show reasonable initiative when the relevant law is not\r\n \u201cclearly established,\u201d Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 817; a\r\n                     Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)                     3\r\n\r\n                                Syllabus\r\n\r\n  quick resolution of a qualified immunity claim is essential. There is,\r\n  however, no such public interest at stake simply because the judg-\r\n  ment bar is said to be applicable. It is the avoidance of litigation for\r\n  its own sake that supports the bar, and if simply abbreviating litiga-\r\n  tion troublesome to government employees were important enough,\r\n  \u00a71291 would fade out whenever the government or an official lost in\r\n  an early round. Another difference between qualified immunity and\r\n  the judgment bar lies in the bar\u2019s essential procedural element.\r\n  While a qualified immunity claim is timely from the moment an offi-\r\n  cial is served with a complaint, the judgment bar can be raised only\r\n  after a case under the Tort Claims Act has been resolved in the Gov-\r\n  ernment\u2019s favor. The closer analogy to the judgment bar is the de-\r\n  fense of res judicata. Both are grounded in the perceived need to\r\n  avoid duplicative litigation, not in a policy of freeing a defendant\r\n  from any liability.

S. C. \u00a71291,\r\nincludes appellate jurisdiction over \u201ca narrow class of\r\ndecisions that do not terminate the litigation,\u201d but are\r\nsufficiently important and collateral to the merits that\r\nthey should \u201cnonetheless be treated as final,\u201d Digital\r\nEquipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U. S. 863, 867\r\n(1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). The issue here is\r\nwhether a refusal to apply the judgment bar of the Federal\r\nTort Claims Act is open to collateral appeal. We hold it is\r\nnot.\r\n                             I\r\n  The complaint alleges that Susan Hallock owned a\r\ncomputer software business that she and her husband,\r\nRichard, operated from home. After information about\r\nRichard Hallock\u2019s credit card was stolen and used to pay\r\nthe subscription fee for a child pornography Web site,\r\nagents of the United States Customs Service, investigating\r\nthe Web site, traced the payment to Richard Hallock\u2019s\r\ncard and got a warrant to search the Hallocks\u2019 residence.\r\n2                     WILL v. HALLOCK\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nWith that authority, they seized the Hallocks\u2019 computer\r\nequipment, software, and disk drives. No criminal charges\r\nwere ever brought, but the Government\u2019s actions produced\r\na different disaster. When the computer equipment was\r\nreturned, several of the disk drives were damaged, all of\r\nthe stored data (including trade secrets and account files)\r\nwere lost, and the Hallocks were forced out of business.\r\n   In July 2002, Susan Hallock and her company brought\r\nan action against the United States under the Federal\r\nTort Claims Act, invoking the waiver of sovereign immu-\r\nnity, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71346, and alleging negligence by the\r\ncustoms agents in executing the search. The merits of the\r\nclaim were never addressed, for the District Court granted\r\nthe Government\u2019s motion to dismiss, holding that the\r\nagents\u2019 activities occurred in the course of detaining goods\r\nand thus fell within an exception to the Act\u2019s waiver of\r\nsovereign immunity, \u00a72680(e). Hallock v. United States,\r\n253 F. Supp. 2d 361 (NDNY 2003).\r\n   While the suit against the Government was still pend-\r\ning, Susan Hallock filed this action against the individual\r\nagents under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics\r\nAgents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), alleging in her complaint\r\nthat the agents had damaged her computers and thus\r\ndeprived her of property including business income in\r\nviolation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amend-\r\nment. After the District Court dismissed the first suit\r\nagainst the Government, the agents moved for judgment\r\nin the Bivens action, citing the judgment bar of the Tort\r\nClaims Act, that \u201cthe judgment in an action under 1346(b)\r\nof this title shall constitute a complete bar to any action by\r\nthe claimant, by reason of the same subject matter,\r\nagainst the employee of the government whose act or\r\nomission gave rise to the claim.\u201d \u00a72676.\r\n   The District Court denied the motion, holding that\r\ndismissal of the action against the Government under the\r\nTort Claims Act was solely on a procedural ground, and\r\n                  Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)            3\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nthus failed to raise the judgment bar. Hallock v. Bonner,\r\n281 F. Supp. 2d 425, 427 (NDNY 2003). The Court of\r\nAppeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, after first finding\r\njurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine. Hallock v.\r\nBonner, 387 F. 3d 147 (2004). We granted certiorari to\r\nconsider the judgment bar, 545 U. S. ___ (2005), but now\r\nvacate for want of appellate jurisdiction on the part of the\r\nCourt of Appeals.\r\n                               II\r\n  The collateral order doctrine, identified with Cohen v.\r\nBeneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541 (1949), is\r\n\u201cbest understood not as an exception to the \u2018final decision\u2019\r\nrule laid down by Congress in \u00a71291, but as a \u2018practical\r\nconstruction\u2019 of it.\u201d Digital Equipment, supra, at 867\r\n(quoting Cohen, supra, at 546). Whereas 28 U. S. C. \u00a71291\r\n\u201cgives courts of appeals jurisdiction over \u2018all final deci-\r\nsions\u2019 of district courts\u201d that are not directly appealable to\r\nus, Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U. S. 299, 305 (1996), the\r\ncollateral order doctrine accommodates a \u201csmall class\u201d of\r\nrulings, not concluding the litigation, but conclusively\r\nresolving \u201cclaims of right separable from, and collateral to,\r\nrights asserted in the action,\u201d ibid. (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted). The claims are \u201ctoo important to be\r\ndenied review and too independent of the cause itself to\r\nrequire that appellate consideration be deferred until the\r\nwhole case is adjudicated.\u201d Cohen, supra, at 546.\r\n  The requirements for collateral order appeal have been\r\ndistilled down to three conditions: that an order \u201c \u2018[1]\r\nconclusively determine the disputed question, [2] resolve\r\nan important issue completely separate from the merits of\r\nthe action, and [3] be effectively unreviewable on appeal\r\nfrom a final judgment.\u2019 \u201d Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer\r\nAuthority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139, 144\r\n(1993) (quoting Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S.\r\n463, 468 (1978)). The conditions are \u201cstringent,\u201d Digital\r\n4                     WILL v. HALLOCK\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nEquipment, supra, at 868 (citing Midland Asphalt Corp. v.\r\nUnited States, 489 U. S. 794, 799 (1989)), and unless they\r\nare kept so, the underlying doctrine will overpower the\r\nsubstantial finality interests \u00a71291 is meant to further:\r\njudicial efficiency, for example, and the \u201csensible policy \u2018of\r\navoid[ing] the obstruction to just claims that would come\r\nfrom permitting the harassment and cost of a succession of\r\nseparate appeals from the various rulings to which a\r\nlitigation may give rise.\u2019 \u201d Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v.\r\nRisjord, 449 U. S. 368, 374 (1981) (quoting Cobbledick v.\r\nUnited States, 309 U. S. 323, 325 (1940)).\r\n   Accordingly, we have not mentioned applying the collat-\r\neral order doctrine recently without emphasizing its mod-\r\nest scope. See, e.g., Digital Equipment, 511 U. S., at 868\r\n(\u201c[T]he \u2018narrow\u2019 exception should stay that way and never\r\nbe allowed to swallow the general rule that a party is\r\nentitled to a single appeal, to be deferred until final judg-\r\nment has been entered . . . \u201d (citation omitted)). And we\r\nhave meant what we have said; although the Court has\r\nbeen asked many times to expand the \u201csmall class\u201d of\r\ncollaterally appealable orders, we have instead kept it\r\nnarrow and selective in its membership.\r\n                             A\r\n  Prior cases mark the line between rulings within the\r\nclass and those outside. On the immediately appealable\r\nside are orders rejecting absolute immunity, Nixon v.\r\nFitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 742 (1982), and qualified immu-\r\nnity, Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 530 (1985). A\r\nState has the benefit of the doctrine to appeal a decision\r\ndenying its claim to Eleventh Amendment immunity,\r\nPuerto Rico Aqueduct, supra, at 144\u2013145, and a criminal\r\ndefendant may collaterally appeal an adverse ruling on a\r\ndefense of double jeopardy, Abney v. United States, 431\r\nU. S. 651, 660 (1977).\r\n  The examples admittedly raise the lawyer\u2019s temptation\r\n                  Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)             5\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nto generalize. In each case, the collaterally appealing\r\nparty was vindicating or claiming a right to avoid trial, in\r\nsatisfaction of the third condition: unless the order to\r\nstand trial was immediately appealable, the right would\r\nbe effectively lost. Those seeking immediate appeal there-\r\nfore naturally argue that any order denying a claim of\r\nright to prevail without trial satisfies the third condition.\r\nBut this generalization is too easy to be sound and, if\r\naccepted, would leave the final order requirement of \u00a71291\r\nin tatters. We faced this prospect in Digital Equipment,\r\nsupra, an appeal from an order rescinding a settlement\r\nagreement. Petitioner asserted a \u201c \u2018right not to stand trial\u2019\r\nrequiring protection by way of immediate appeal,\u201d analo-\r\ngizing the rescission to a denial of immunity. Id., at 869.\r\nWe said no, however, lest \u201cevery right that could be en-\r\nforced appropriately by pretrial dismissal [be] loosely . . .\r\ndescribed as conferring a \u2018right not to stand trial.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\r\n873. Otherwise, \u201calmost every pretrial or trial order might\r\nbe called \u2018effectively unreviewable\u2019 in the sense that relief\r\nfrom error can never extend to rewriting history.\u201d Id., at\r\n872.\r\n    \u201cAllowing immediate appeals to vindicate every such\r\n    right would move \u00a71291 aside for claims that the dis-\r\n    trict court lacks personal jurisdiction, that the statute\r\n    of limitations has run, that the movant has been de-\r\n    nied his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, that\r\n    an action is barred on claim preclusion principles,\r\n    that no material fact is in dispute and the moving\r\n    party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, or\r\n    merely that the complaint fails to state a claim. Such\r\n    motions can be made in virtually every case.\u201d Id., at\r\n    873 (citations omitted).\r\n                           B\r\n  Since only some orders denying an asserted right to\r\navoid the burdens of trial qualify, then, as orders that\r\n6                     WILL v. HALLOCK\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ncannot be reviewed \u201ceffectively\u201d after a conventional final\r\njudgment, the cases have to be combed for some further\r\ncharacteristic that merits appealability under Cohen; and\r\nas Digital Equipment explained, that something further\r\nboils down to \u201ca judgment about the value of the interests\r\nthat would be lost through rigorous application of a final\r\njudgment requirement.\u201d 511 U. S., at 878\u2013879 (citing Van\r\nCauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U. S. 517, 524 (1988)). See\r\nalso Lauro Lines s.r.l. v. Chasser, 490 U. S. 495, 502 (1989)\r\n(\u201cThe importance of the right asserted has always been a\r\nsignificant part of our collateral order doctrine\u201d (SCALIA,\r\nJ., concurring)).\r\n   Thus, in Nixon, supra, we stressed the \u201ccompelling\r\npublic ends,\u201d id., at 758, \u201crooted in . . . the separation of\r\npowers,\u201d id., at 749, that would be compromised by failing\r\nto allow immediate appeal of a denial of absolute Presi-\r\ndential immunity, id., at 743, 752, n. 32. In explaining\r\ncollateral order treatment when a qualified immunity\r\nclaim was at issue in Mitchell, supra, we spoke of the\r\nthreatened disruption of governmental functions, and fear\r\nof inhibiting able people from exercising discretion in\r\npublic service if a full trial were threatened whenever they\r\nacted reasonably in the face of law that is not \u201cclearly\r\nestablished.\u201d Id., at 526. Puerto Rico Aqueduct, 506 U. S.\r\n139, explained the immediate appealability of an order\r\ndenying a claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity by\r\nadverting not only to the burdens of litigation but to the\r\nneed to ensure vindication of a State\u2019s dignitary interests.\r\nId., at 146. And although the double jeopardy claim given\r\nCohen treatment in Abney, supra, did not implicate a right\r\nto be free of all proceedings whatsoever (since prior jeop-\r\nardy is essential to the defense), we described the enor-\r\nmous prosecutorial power of the Government to subject an\r\nindividual \u201cto embarrassment, expense and ordeal . . .\r\ncompelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety,\u201d\r\nid., at 661\u2013662 (internal quotation marks omitted); the\r\n                  Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nonly way to alleviate these consequences of the Govern-\r\nment\u2019s superior position was by collateral order appeal.\r\n  In each case, some particular value of a high order was\r\nmarshaled in support of the interest in avoiding trial:\r\nhonoring the separation of powers, preserving the effi-\r\nciency of government and the initiative of its officials,\r\nrespecting a State\u2019s dignitary interests, and mitigating the\r\ngovernment\u2019s advantage over the individual. That is, it is\r\nnot mere avoidance of a trial, but avoidance of a trial that\r\nwould imperil a substantial public interest, that counts\r\nwhen asking whether an order is \u201ceffectively\u201d unreview-\r\nable if review is to be left until later. Coopers & Lybrand,\r\n437 U. S., at 468.\r\n                              C\r\n   Does the claim of the customs agents in this case serve\r\nsuch a weighty public objective that the judgment bar\r\nshould be treated as an immunity demanding the protec-\r\ntion of a collateral order appeal? One can argue, of course,\r\nthat if the Bivens action goes to trial the efficiency of\r\nGovernment will be compromised and the officials bur-\r\ndened and distracted, as in the qualified immunity case: if\r\nqualified immunity gets Cohen treatment, so should the\r\njudgment bar to further litigation in the aftermath of the\r\nGovernment\u2019s success under the Tort Claims Act. But the\r\ncases are different. Qualified immunity is not the law\r\nsimply to save trouble for the Government and its employ-\r\nees; it is recognized because the burden of trial is unjusti-\r\nfied in the face of a colorable claim that the law on point\r\nwas not clear when the official took action, and the action\r\nwas reasonable in light of the law as it was. The nub of\r\nqualified immunity is the need to induce officials to show\r\nreasonable initiative when the relevant law is not \u201cclearly\r\nestablished,\u201d Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818\r\n(1982); see also Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 202 (2001); a\r\nquick resolution of a qualified immunity claim is essential.\r\n8                          WILL v. HALLOCK\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   There is, however, no such public interest at stake\r\nsimply because the judgment bar is said to be applicable.\r\nIt is not the preservation of initiative but the avoidance of\r\nlitigation for its own sake that supports the judgment bar,\r\nand if simply abbreviating litigation troublesome to Gov-\r\nernment employees were important enough for Cohen\r\ntreatment, collateral order appeal would be a matter of\r\nright whenever the government lost a motion to dismiss\r\nunder the Tort Claims Act, or a federal officer lost one on a\r\nBivens action, or a state official was in that position in a\r\ncase under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, or Ex parte Young, 209 U. S.\r\n123 (1908). In effect, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71291 would fade out\r\nwhenever the government or an official lost an early round\r\nthat could have ended the fight.\r\n   Another difference between qualified immunity and the\r\njudgment bar lies in the bar\u2019s essential procedural ele-\r\nment. While a qualified immunity claim is timely from\r\nthe moment an official is served with a complaint, the\r\njudgment bar can be raised only after a case under the\r\nTort Claims Act has been resolved in the Government\u2019s\r\nfavor. If a Bivens action alone is brought, there will be no\r\npossibility of a judgment bar, nor will there be so long as a\r\nBivens action against officials and a Tort Claims Act\r\nagainst the Government are pending simultaneously (as\r\nthey were for a time here). In the present case, if Susan\r\nHallock had brought her Bivens action and no other, the\r\nagents could not possibly have invoked the judgment bar\r\nin claiming a right to be free of trial. The closer analogy to\r\nthe judgment bar, then, is not immunity but the defense of\r\nclaim preclusion, or res judicata.\r\n   Although the statutory judgment bar is arguably\r\nbroader than traditional res judicata, it functions in much\r\nthe same way, with both rules depending on a prior judg-\r\nment as a condition precedent* and neither reflecting a\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n    * The right to be free of double jeopardy is subject to an analogous\r\n                     Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)                     9\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\npolicy that a defendant should be scot free of any liability.\r\nThe concern behind both rules is a different one, of avoid-\r\ning duplicative litigation, \u201cmultiple suits on identical\r\nentitlements or obligations between the same parties.\u201d 18\r\nC. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and\r\nProcedure \u00a74402, p. 9 (2d ed. 2002) (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted). But this rule of respecting a prior judg-\r\nment by giving a defense against relitigation has not been\r\nthought to protect values so great that only immediate\r\nappeal can effectively vindicate them. As we indicated in\r\nDigital Equipment, in the usual case, absent particular\r\nreasons for discretionary appeal by leave of the trial court,\r\na defense of claim preclusion is fairly subordinated to the\r\ngeneral policy of deferring appellate review to the moment\r\nof final judgment. 511 U. S., at 873.\r\n   The judgment bar at issue in this case has no claim to\r\ngreater importance than the typical defense of claim pre-\r\nclusion; and we hold true to form in deciding what Digital\r\nEquipment implied, that an order rejecting the defense of\r\njudgment bar under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72676 cries for no immedi-\r\nate appeal of right as a collateral order.\r\n   We vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and\r\nremand with instructions to dismiss the appeal for lack of\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \r\n\r\ncondition, that jeopardy have attached in a prior proceeding, Monge v.\r\n\r\nCalifornia, 524 U. S. 721, 728 (1998), a characteristic that distinguishes\r\n\r\nthe Fifth Amendment right from other immunities mentioned above. \r\n\r\nBut, as we explained, double jeopardy deserves immunity treatment\r\n\r\nunder \u00a71291 owing to the enormous advantage of a government prose\r\n       -\r\ncutor who chooses to go repeatedly against an individual. \r\n\r\n",

The merits of the claim were never addressed, for the District Court granted the Government's motion to dismiss, holding that the agents' activities occurred in the course of detaining goods and thus fell within an exception to the Act's waiver of sovereign immunity, \u00a7 2680(e). <i>Hallock</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2567761\"><a href=\"/opinion/2567761/hallock-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

After the District Court dismissed the first suit against the Government, the agents moved for judgment in the <i>Bivens</i> action, citing the judgment bar of the Tort Claims Act, that \"the judgment in an action under [\u00a7] 1346(b) of this title shall constitute a complete bar to any action by the claimant, by reason of the same subject matter, against the employee of the government whose act or omission gave rise to the claim.\" \u00a7 2676.</p>\n<p>The District Court denied the motion, holding that dismissal of the action against the Government under the Tort <span class=\"star-pagination\">*349</span> Claims Act was solely on a procedural ground, and thus failed to raise the judgment bar. <i>Hallock</i> v. <i>Bonner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2493748\"><a href=\"/opinion/2493748/hallock-v-bonner/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

We granted certiorari to consider the judgment bar, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1103</span></span> (2005), but now vacate for want of appellate jurisdiction on the part of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The collateral order doctrine, identified with <i>Cohen</i> v. <i>Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104695\"><a href=\"/opinion/104695/cohen-v-beneficial-industrial-loan-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span> (1949), is \"best understood not as an exception to the `final decision' rule laid down by Congress in \u00a7 1291, but as a `practical construction' of it.\" <i>Digital Equipment, supra,</i> at 867 (quoting <i>Cohen, supra,</i> at 546). Whereas 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 \"gives courts of appeals jurisdiction over `all final decisions' of district courts\" that are not directly appealable to us, <i>Behrens</i> v. <i>Pelletier,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117996\"><a href=\"/opinion/117996/behrens-v-pelletier/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span>, 305 (1996), the collateral order doctrine accommodates a \"small class\" of rulings, not concluding the litigation, but conclusively resolving \"claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action,\" <i>ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). The claims are \"too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\" <i>Cohen, supra,</i> at 546.</p>\n<p>The requirements for collateral order appeal have been distilled down to three conditions: that an order \"`[1] conclusively determine the disputed question, [2] resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and [3] be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.'\" <i>Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority</i> v. <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112800\"><a href=\"/opinion/112800/puerto-rico-aqueduct-and-sewer-authority-v-metcalf/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 144 (1993) (quoting <i>Coopers &amp; Lybrand</i> v. <i>Livesay,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109908\"><a href=\"/opinion/109908/coopers-lybrand-v-livesay/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">463</span></a></span>, 468 (1978)). The conditions are \"stringent,\" <i>Digital Equipment, supra,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*350</span> at 868 (citing <i>Midland Asphalt Corp.</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112226\"><a href=\"/opinion/112226/midland-asphalt-corp-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">794</span></a></span>, 799 (1989)), and unless they are kept so, the underlying doctrine will overpower the substantial finality interests \u00a7 1291 is meant to further: judicial efficiency, for example, and the \"sensible policy `of avoid[ing] the obstruction to just claims that would come from permitting the harassment and cost of a succession of separate appeals from the various rulings to which a litigation may give rise.'\" <i>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</i> v. <i>Risjord,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110373\"><a href=\"/opinion/110373/firestone-tire-rubber-co-v-risjord/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span>, 374 (1981) (quoting <i>Cobbledick</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103311\"><a href=\"/opinion/103311/cobbledick-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span>, 325 (1940)).</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we have not mentioned applying the collateral order doctrine recently without emphasizing its modest scope. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Digital Equipment,</i> 511 U.S., at 868 (\"[T]he `narrow' exception should stay that way and never be allowed to swallow the general rule that a party is entitled to a single appeal, to be deferred until final judgment has been entered ...\" (citation omitted)). And we have meant what we have said; although the Court has been asked many times to expand the \"small class\" of collaterally appealable orders, we have instead kept it narrow and selective in its membership.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Prior cases mark the line between rulings within the class and those outside. On the immediately appealable side are orders rejecting absolute immunity, <i>Nixon</i> v. <i>Fitzgerald,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110762\"><a href=\"/opinion/110762/nixon-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 742 (1982), and qualified immunity, <i>Mitchell</i> v. <i>Forsyth,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111481\"><a href=\"/opinion/111481/mitchell-v-forsyth/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 530 (1985). A State has the benefit of the doctrine to appeal a decision denying its claim to Eleventh Amendment immunity, <i>Puerto Rico Aqueduct, supra,</i> at 144-145, and a criminal defendant may collaterally appeal an adverse ruling on a defense of double jeopardy, <i>Abney</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109677\"><a href=\"/opinion/109677/abney-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span>, 660 (1977).</p>\n<p>The examples admittedly raise the lawyer's temptation to generalize. In each case, the collaterally appealing party was vindicating or claiming a right to avoid trial, in satisfaction of the third condition: unless the order to stand trial was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*351</span> immediately appealable, the right would be effectively lost. Those seeking immediate appeal therefore naturally argue that any order denying a claim of right to prevail without trial satisfies the third condition. But this generalization is too easy to be sound and, if accepted, would leave the final order requirement of \u00a7 1291 in tatters. We faced this prospect in <i>Digital Equipment, supra,</i> an appeal from an order rescinding a settlement agreement. Petitioner asserted a \"`right not to stand trial' requiring protection by way of immediate appeal,\" analogizing the rescission to a denial of immunity. <i>Id.,</i> at 869. We said no, however, lest \"every right that could be enforced appropriately by pretrial dismissal [be] loosely . . . described as conferring a `right not to stand trial.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 873. Otherwise, \"almost every pretrial or trial order might be called `effectively unreviewable' in the sense that relief from error can never extend to rewriting history.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 872.</p>\n<blockquote>\"Allowing immediate appeals to vindicate every such right would move \u00a7 1291 aside for claims that the district court lacks personal jurisdiction, that the statute of limitations has run, that the movant has been denied his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, that an action is barred on claim preclusion principles, that no material fact is in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, or merely that the complaint fails to state a claim. Such motions can be made in virtually every case.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 873 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Since only some orders denying an asserted right to avoid the burdens of trial qualify, then, as orders that cannot be reviewed \"effectively\" after a conventional final judgment, the cases have to be combed for some further characteristic that merits appealability under <i>Cohen;</i> and as <i>Digital Equipment</i> explained, that something further boils down to \"a judgment about the value of the interests that would be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*352</span> lost through rigorous application of a final judgment requirement.\" 511 U.S., at 878-879 (citing <i>Van Cauwenberghe</i> v. <i>Biard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112092\"><a href=\"/opinion/112092/van-cauwenberghe-v-biard/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span>, 524 (1988)). See also <i>Lauro Lines s.r.l.</i> v. <i>Chasser,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112263\"><a href=\"/opinion/112263/lauro-lines-srl-v-chasser/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">495</span></a></span>, 502 (1989) (SCALIA, J., concurring) (\"The importance of the right asserted has always been a significant part of our collateral order doctrine\").</p>\n<p>Thus, in <i>Nixon, supra,</i> we stressed the \"compelling public ends,\" <i>id.,</i> at 758, \"rooted in . . . the separation of powers,\" <i>id.,</i> at 749, that would be compromised by failing to allow immediate appeal of a denial of absolute Presidential immunity, <i>id.,</i> at 743, 752, n. 32. In explaining collateral order treatment when a qualified immunity claim was at issue in <i>Mitchell, supra,</i> we spoke of the threatened disruption of governmental functions, and fear of inhibiting able people from exercising discretion in public service if a full trial were threatened whenever they acted reasonably in the face of law that is not \"clearly established.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 526. <i>Puerto Rico Aqueduct,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112800\"><a href=\"/opinion/112800/puerto-rico-aqueduct-and-sewer-authority-v-metcalf/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, explained the immediate appealability of an order denying a claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity by adverting not only to the burdens of litigation but to the need to ensure vindication of a State's dignitary interests. <i>Id.,</i> at 146. And although the double jeopardy claim given <i>Cohen</i> treatment in <i>Abney, supra,</i> did not implicate a right to be free of all proceedings whatsoever (since prior jeopardy is essential to the defense), we described the enormous prosecutorial power of the Government to subject an individual \"to embarrassment, expense and ordeal . . . compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety,\" <i>id.,</i> at 661-662 (internal quotation marks omitted); the only way to alleviate these consequences of the Government's superior position was by collateral order appeal.</p>\n<p>In each case, some particular value of a high order was marshaled in support of the interest in avoiding trial: honoring the separation of powers, preserving the efficiency of government and the initiative of its officials, respecting a State's dignitary interests, and mitigating the government's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*353</span> advantage over the individual. That is, it is not mere avoidance of a trial, but avoidance of a trial that would imperil a substantial public interest, that counts when asking whether an order is \"effectively\" unreviewable if review is to be left until later. <i>Coopers &amp; Lybrand,</i> 437 U.S., at 468 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Does the claim of the customs agents in this case serve such a weighty public objective that the judgment bar should be treated as an immunity demanding the protection of a collateral order appeal? One can argue, of course, that if the <i>Bivens</i> action goes to trial the efficiency of Government will be compromised and the officials burdened and distracted, as in the qualified immunity case: if qualified immunity gets <i>Cohen</i> treatment, so should the judgment bar to further litigation in the aftermath of the Government's success under the Tort Claims Act. But the cases are different. Qualified immunity is not the law simply to save trouble for the Government and its employees; it is recognized because the burden of trial is unjustified in the face of a colorable claim that the law on point was not clear when the official took action, and the action was reasonable in light of the law as it was. The nub of qualified immunity is the need to induce officials to show reasonable initiative when the relevant law is not \"clearly established,\" <i>Harlow</i> v. <i>Fitzgerald,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, 818 (1982); cf. <i>Saucier</i> v. <i>Katz,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span>, 202 (2001); a quick resolution of a qualified immunity claim is essential.</p>\n<p>There is, however, no such public interest at stake simply because the judgment bar is said to be applicable. It is not the preservation of initiative but the avoidance of litigation for its own sake that supports the judgment bar, and if simply abbreviating litigation troublesome to Government employees were important enough for <i>Cohen</i> treatment, collateral order appeal would be a matter of right whenever the Government lost a motion to dismiss under the Tort <span class=\"star-pagination\">*354</span> Claims Act, or a federal officer lost one on a <i>Bivens</i> action, or a state official was in that position in a case under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, or <i>Ex parte Young,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96819\"><a href=\"/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span> (1908). In effect, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 would fade out whenever the Government or an official lost an early round that could have ended the fight.</p>\n<p>Another difference between qualified immunity and the judgment bar lies in the bar's essential procedural element. While a qualified immunity claim is timely from the moment an official is served with a complaint, the judgment bar can be raised only after a case under the Tort Claims Act has been resolved in the Government's favor. If a <i>Bivens</i> action alone is brought, there will be no possibility of a judgment bar, nor will there be so long as a <i>Bivens</i> action against officials and a Tort Claims Act against the Government are pending simultaneously (as they were for a time here). In the present case, if Susan Hallock had brought her <i>Bivens</i> action and no other, the agents could not possibly have invoked the judgment bar in claiming a right to be free of trial. The closer analogy to the judgment bar, then, is not immunity but the defense of claim preclusion, or res judicata.</p>\n<p>Although the statutory judgment bar is arguably broader than traditional res judicata, it functions in much the same way, with both rules depending on a prior judgment as a condition precedent<sup>[*]</sup> and neither reflecting a policy that a defendant should be scot free of any liability. The concern behind both rules is a different one, of avoiding duplicative litigation, \"multiple suits on identical entitlements or obligations between the same parties.\" 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; <span class=\"star-pagination\">*355</span> E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4402, p. 9 (2d ed. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). But this rule of respecting a prior judgment by giving a defense against relitigation has not been thought to protect values so great that only immediate appeal can effectively vindicate them. As we indicated in <i>Digital Equipment,</i> in the usual case, absent particular reasons for discretionary appeal by leave of the trial court, a defense of claim preclusion is fairly subordinated to the general policy of deferring appellate review to the moment of final judgment. 511 U.S., at 873.</p>\n<p>The judgment bar at issue in this case has no claim to greater importance than the typical defense of claim preclusion; and we hold true to form in deciding what <i>Digital Equipment</i> implied, that an order rejecting the defense of judgment bar under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2676 cries for no immediate appeal of right as a collateral order.</p>\n<p>We vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case with instructions to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The right to be free of double jeopardy is subject to an analogous condition, that jeopardy have attached in a prior proceeding, <i>Monge</i> v. <i>California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118243\"><a href=\"/opinion/118243/monge-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">721</span></a></span>, 728 (1998), a characteristic that distinguishes the Fifth Amendment right from other immunities mentioned above. But, as we explained, double jeopardy deserves immunity treatment under \u00a7 1291 owing to the enormous advantage of a Government prosecutor who chooses to go repeatedly against an individual.</p>\n\n</div>",
