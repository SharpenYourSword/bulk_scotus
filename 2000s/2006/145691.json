We hold that invalidating the statute entirely is not always necessary or justified, for lower courts may be able to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In 2003, New Hampshire enacted the Parental Notification Prior to Abortion Act. N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 132:24-132:28 (2005). The Act prohibits physicians from performing an abortion on a pregnant minor (or a woman for whom a guardian or conservator has been appointed) until 48 hours after written notice of the pending abortion is delivered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*324</span> to her parent or guardian. \u00a7 132:25(I). Notice may be delivered personally or by certified mail. \u00a7\u00a7 132:25(II), (III). Violations of the Act are subject to criminal and civil penalties. \u00a7 132:27.</p>\n<p>The Act allows for three circumstances in which a physician may perform an abortion without notifying the minor's parent. First, notice is not required if \"[t]he attending abortion provider certifies in the pregnant minor's record that the abortion is necessary to prevent the minor's death and there is insufficient time to provide the required notice.\" \u00a7 132:26(I)(a). Second, a person entitled to receive notice may certify that he or she has already been notified. \u00a7 132:26(I)(b). Finally, a minor may petition a judge to authorize her physician to perform an abortion without parental notification. The judge must so authorize if he or she finds that the minor is mature and capable of giving informed consent, or that an abortion without notification is in the minor's best interests. \u00a7 132:26(II). These judicial bypass proceedings \"shall be confidential and shall be given precedence over other pending matters so that the court may reach a decision promptly and without delay,\" and access to the courts \"shall be afforded [to the] pregnant minor 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\" \u00a7\u00a7 132:26(II)(b), (c). The trial and appellate courts must each rule on bypass petitions within seven days. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Act does not explicitly permit a physician to perform an abortion in a medical emergency without parental notification.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Respondents are Dr. Wayne Goldner, an obstetrician and gynecologist who has a private practice in Manchester, and three clinics that offer reproductive health services. All provide abortions for pregnant minors, and each anticipates having to provide emergency abortions for minors in the future. Before the Act took effect, respondents brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that the Act is unconstitutional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*325</span> because it fails \"to allow a physician to provide a prompt abortion to a minor whose health would be endangered\" by delays inherent in the Act. App. 10 (Complaint, \u00b6 24). Respondents also challenged the adequacy of the Act's life exception and of the judicial bypass' confidentiality provision.</p>\n<p>The District Court declared the Act unconstitutional, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a), and permanently enjoined its enforcement. It held, first, that the Act was invalid for failure \"on its face [to] comply with the constitutional requirement that laws restricting a woman's access to abortion must provide a health exception.\" <i>Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng.</i> v. <i>Heed,</i> 296 F. Supp. 2d 59, 65 (NH 2003). It also found that the Act's judicial bypass would not operate expeditiously enough in medical emergencies. In the alternative, the District Court held the Act's life exception unconstitutional because it requires physicians to certify with impossible precision that an abortion is \"necessary\" to avoid death, and fails to protect their good faith medical judgment.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed. Citing our decisions in <i>Stenberg</i> v. <i>Carhart,</i> 530 U.S. 914, 929-930 (2000), <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</i> v. <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S. 833, 879 (1992) (plurality opinion), and <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U.S. 113, 164-165 (1973), it observed: \"Complementing the general undue burden standard [for reviewing abortion regulations], the Supreme Court has also identified a specific and independent constitutional requirement that an abortion regulation must contain an exception for the preservation of the pregnant woman's health.\" <i>Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng.</i> v. <i>Heed,</i> 390 F.3d 53, 58 (2004). It went on to conclude that the Act is unconstitutional because it does not contain an explicit health exception, and its judicial bypass, along with other provisions of state law, is no substitute. The Court of Appeals further found the Act unconstitutional because, in its view, the life exception forces physicians to gamble with their patients' <span class=\"star-pagination\">*326</span> lives by prohibiting them from performing an abortion without notification until they are certain that death is imminent, and is intolerably vague. Because the district and appellate courts permanently enjoined the Act's enforcement on the basis of the above infirmities, neither reached respondents' objection to the judicial bypass' confidentiality provision.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 544 U.S. 1048 (2005), to decide whether the courts below erred in invalidating the Act in its entirety because it lacks an exception for the preservation of pregnant minors' health. We now vacate and remand for the Court of Appeals to reconsider its choice of remedy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>As the case comes to us, three propositions\u0097two legal and one factual\u0097are established. First, States unquestionably have the right to require parental involvement when a minor considers terminating her pregnancy, because of their \"strong and legitimate interest in the welfare of [their] young citizens, whose immaturity, inexperience, and lack of judgment may sometimes impair their ability to exercise their rights wisely.\" <i>Hodgson</i> v. <i>Minnesota,</i> 497 U.S. 417, 444-445 (1990) (opinion of Stevens, J.).<sup>[1]</sup> Accordingly, we have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*327</span> long upheld state parental involvement statutes like the Act before us, and we cast no doubt on those holdings today. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Lambert</i> v. <i>Wicklund,</i> 520 U.S. 292 (1997) <i>(per curiam)</i>; <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 899 (joint opinion); <i>Ohio</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health,</i> 497 U.S. 502, 510-519 (1990); <i>Hodgson,</i> 497 U.S., at 461 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment in part); <i>id.,</i> at 497-501 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Second, New Hampshire does not dispute, and our precedents hold, that a State may not restrict access to abortions that are \"`necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.'\" <i>Casey,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*328</span> 505 U.S., at 879 (plurality opinion) (quoting <i>Roe,</i> 410 U.S., at 164-165); see also <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U.S. 747, 768-769 (1986); <i>Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc.</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 462 U.S. 476, 482-486 (1983) (opinion of Powell, J.); <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U.S. 52, 79 (1976).</p>\n<p>Third, New Hampshire has not taken real issue with the factual basis of this litigation: In some very small percentage of cases, pregnant minors, like adult women, need immediate abortions to avert serious and often irreversible damage to their health. See 296 F. Supp. 2d, at 65, n. 4.</p>\n<p>New Hampshire has maintained that in most if not all cases, the Act's judicial bypass and the State's \"competing harms\" statutes should protect both physician and patient when a minor needs an immediate abortion. See N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 627:3(I) (1996) (for criminal liability, \"[c]onduct which the actor believes to be necessary to avoid harm to . . . another is justifiable if the desirability and urgency of avoiding such harm outweigh, according to ordinary standards of reasonableness, the harm sought to be prevented by the statute defining the offense charged\"); \u00a7 627:1 (similar for civil liability). But the District Court and Court of Appeals found neither of these provisions to protect minors' health reliably in all emergencies. 296 F. Supp. 2d, at 65-66; 390 F.3d, at 61-62. And New Hampshire has conceded that, under our cases, it would be unconstitutional to apply the Act in a manner that subjects minors to significant health risks. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 2, 8, 11; Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 14.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>We turn to the question of remedy: When a statute restricting access to abortion may be applied in a manner that harms women's health, what is the appropriate relief? Generally speaking, when confronting a constitutional flaw in a statute, we try to limit the solution to the problem. We prefer, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*329</span> for example, to enjoin only the unconstitutional applications of a statute while leaving other applications in force, see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Raines,</i> 362 U.S. 17, 20-22 (1960), or to sever its problematic portions while leaving the remainder intact, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 227-229 (2005).</p>\n<p>Three interrelated principles inform our approach to remedies. First, we try not to nullify more of a legislature's work than is necessary, for we know that \"[a] ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates the intent of the elected representatives of the people.\" <i>Regan</i> v. <i>Time, Inc.,</i> 468 U.S. 641, 652 (1984) (plurality opinion). It is axiomatic that a \"statute may be invalid as applied to one state of facts and yet valid as applied to another.\" <i>Dahnke-Walker Milling Co.</i> v. <i>Bondurant,</i> 257 U.S. 282, 289 (1921). Accordingly, the \"normal rule\" is that \"partial, rather than facial, invalidation is the required course,\" such that a \"statute may . . . be declared invalid to the extent that it reaches too far, but otherwise left intact.\" <i>Brockett</i> v. <i>Spokane Arcades, Inc.,</i> 472 U.S. 491, 504 (1985); see also <i>Tennessee</i> v. <i>Garner,</i> 471 U.S. 1 (1985); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Grace,</i> 461 U.S. 171, 180-183 (1983).</p>\n<p>Second, mindful that our constitutional mandate and institutional competence are limited, we restrain ourselves from \"rewrit[ing] state law to conform it to constitutional requirements\" even as we strive to salvage it. <i>Virginia</i> v. <i>American Booksellers Assn., Inc.,</i> 484 U.S. 383, 397 (1988). Our ability to devise a judicial remedy that does not entail quintessentially legislative work often depends on how clearly we have already articulated the background constitutional rules at issue and how easily we can articulate the remedy. In <i>United States</i> v. <i>Grace, supra,</i> at 180-183, for example, we crafted a narrow remedy much like the one we contemplate today, striking down a statute banning expressive displays only as it applied to public sidewalks near the Supreme Court but not as it applied to the Supreme Court Building itself. We later explained that the remedy in <i>Grace</i> was a \"relatively simple matter\" because we had previously distinguished <span class=\"star-pagination\">*330</span> between sidewalks and buildings in our First Amendment jurisprudence. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Treasury Employees,</i> 513 U.S. 454, 479, n. 26 (1995). But making distinctions in a murky constitutional context, or where linedrawing is inherently complex, may call for a \"far more serious invasion of the legislative domain\" than we ought to undertake. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Third, the touchstone for any decision about remedy is legislative intent, for a court cannot \"use its remedial powers to circumvent the intent of the legislature.\" <i>Califano</i> v. <i>Westcott,</i> 443 U.S. 76, 94 (1979) (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); see also <i>Dorchy</i> v. <i>Kansas,</i> 264 U.S. 286, 289-290 (1924) (opinion for the Court by Brandeis, J.). After finding an application or portion of a statute unconstitutional, we must next ask: Would the legislature have preferred what is left of its statute to no statute at all? See generally <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 227; <i>Minnesota</i> v. <i>Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians,</i> 526 U.S. 172, 191 (1999); <i>Alaska Airlines, Inc.</i> v. <i>Brock,</i> 480 U.S. 678, 684 (1987); <i>Champlin Refining Co.</i> v. <i>Corporation Comm'n of Okla.,</i> 286 U.S. 210, 234 (1932); <i>The Employers' Liability Cases,</i> 207 U.S. 463, 501 (1908); <i>Allen</i> v. <i>Louisiana,</i> 103 U.S. 80, 83-84 (1881); <i>Trade-Mark Cases,</i> 100 U.S. 82, 97-98 (1879). All the while, we are wary of legislatures who would rely on our intervention, for \"[i]t would certainly be dangerous if the legislature could set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside\" to announce to whom the statute may be applied. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Reese,</i> 92 U.S. 214, 221 (1876). \"This would, to some extent, substitute the judicial for the legislative department of the government.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>In this case, the courts below chose the most blunt remedy \u0097permanently enjoining the enforcement of New Hampshire's parental notification law and thereby invalidating it entirely. That is understandable, for we, too, have previously <span class=\"star-pagination\">*331</span> invalidated an abortion statute in its entirety because of the same constitutional flaw. In <i>Stenberg,</i> we addressed a Nebraska law banning so-called \"partial birth abortion\" unless the procedure was necessary to save the pregnant woman's life. We held Nebraska's law unconstitutional because it lacked a health exception. 530 U.S., at 930 (lack of a health exception was an \"independent reaso[n]\" for finding the ban unconstitutional). But the parties in <i>Stenberg</i> did not ask for, and we did not contemplate, relief more finely drawn.</p>\n<p>In the case that is before us, however, we agree with New Hampshire that the lower courts need not have invalidated the law wholesale. Respondents, too, recognize the possibility of a modest remedy: They pleaded for any relief \"just and proper,\" App. 13 (Complaint), and conceded at oral argument that carefully crafted injunctive relief may resolve this case, Tr. of Oral Arg. 38, 40. Only a few applications of New Hampshire's parental notification statute would present a constitutional problem. So long as they are faithful to legislative intent, then, in this case the lower courts can issue a declaratory judgment and an injunction prohibiting the statute's unconstitutional application.</p>\n<p>There is some dispute as to whether New Hampshire's legislature intended the statute to be susceptible to such a remedy. New Hampshire notes that the Act contains a severability clause providing that \"[i]f any provision of this subdivision or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the provisions or applications of this subdivision which can be given effect without the invalid provisions or applications.\" \u00a7 132:28. Respondents, on the other hand, contend that New Hampshire legislators preferred no statute at all to a statute enjoined in the way we have described. Because this is an open question, we remand for the lower courts to determine legislative intent in the first instance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*332</span> IV</h2>\n<p>Either an injunction prohibiting unconstitutional applications or a holding that consistency with legislative intent requires invalidating the statute <i>in toto</i> should obviate any concern about the Act's life exception. We therefore need not pass on the lower courts' alternative holding. Finally, if the Act does survive in part on remand, the Court of Appeals should address respondents' separate objection to the judicial bypass' confidentiality provision. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for the State of Texas et al. by <i>Greg Abbott,</i> Attorney General of Texas, <i>Barry R.

PLANNED PARENTHOOD\r\n           OF NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND ET AL.\r\n\r\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\r\n                  THE FIRST CIRCUIT\r\n\r\nNo. 04\u20131144. Argued November 30, 2005\u2014Decided January 18, 2006\r\nNew Hampshire\u2019s Parental Notification Prior to Abortion Act, in rele-\r\n vant part, prohibits physicians from performing an abortion on a\r\n pregnant minor until 48 hours after written notice of such abortion is\r\n delivered to her parent or guardian. The Act does not require notice\r\n for an abortion necessary to prevent the minor\u2019s death if there is in-\r\n sufficient time to provide notice, and permits a minor to petition a\r\n judge to authorize her physician to perform an abortion without pa-\r\n rental notification. The Act does not explicitly permit a physician to\r\n perform an abortion in a medical emergency without parental notifi-\r\n cation. Respondents, who provide abortions for pregnant minors and\r\n expect to provide emergency abortions for them in the future, filed\r\n suit under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, claiming that the Act is unconstitu-\r\n tional because it lacks a health exception and because of the inade-\r\n quacy of the life exception and the judicial bypass\u2019 confidentiality\r\n provision. The District Court declared the Act unconstitutional and\r\n permanently enjoined its enforcement, and the First Circuit affirmed.\r\nHeld: If enforcing a statute that regulates access to abortion would be\r\n unconstitutional in medical emergencies, invalidating the statute en-\r\n tirely is not always necessary or justified, for lower courts may be\r\n able to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief. Pp. 4\u201310.\r\n    (a) As the case comes to this Court, three propositions are estab-\r\n lished. First, States have the right to require parental involvement\r\n when a minor considers terminating her pregnancy. Second, a State\r\n may not restrict access to abortions that are \u201c \u2018necessary, in appropri-\r\n ate medical judgment for preservation of the life or health of the\r\n2        AYOTTE v. PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF NORTHERN \r\n\r\n                          NEW ENG.                                         \r\n\r\n                           Syllabus \r\n\r\n\r\n    mother.\u2019 \u201d Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505\r\n    U. S. 833, 879 (plurality opinion). Third, New Hampshire has not\r\n    taken issue with the case\u2019s factual basis: In a very small percentage\r\n    of cases, pregnant minors need immediate abortions to avert serious\r\n    and often irreversible damage to their health. New Hampshire has\r\n    conceded that, under this Court\u2019s cases, it would be unconstitutional\r\n    to apply the Act in a manner that subjects minors to significant\r\n    health risks. Pp. 4\u20136.\r\n       (b) Generally speaking, when confronting a statute\u2019s constitutional\r\n    flaw, this Court tries to limit the solution to the problem, preferring\r\n    to enjoin only the statute\u2019s unconstitutional applications while leav-\r\n    ing the others in force, see United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 20\u2013\r\n    22, or to sever its problematic portions while leaving the remainder\r\n    intact, United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 227\u2013229. Three inter-\r\n    related principles inform the Court\u2019s approach to remedies. First, the\r\n    Court tries not to nullify more of a legislature\u2019s work than is neces-\r\n    sary. Second, mindful that its constitutional mandate and institu-\r\n    tional competence are limited, the Court restrains itself from \u201cre-\r\n    writ[ing] state law to confirm it to constitutional requirements.\u201d\r\n    Virginia v. American Booksellers Assn., Inc., 484 U. S. 383, 397.\r\n    Third, the touchstone for any decision about remedy is legislative in-\r\n    tent. After finding an application or portion of a statute unconstitu-\r\n    tional, the Court must ask: Would the legislature have preferred\r\n    what is left of its statute to no statute at all? See generally, e.g.,\r\n    Booker, supra, at 227. Here, the courts below chose the most blunt\r\n    remedy\u2014permanently enjoining the Act\u2019s enforcement and thereby\r\n    invalidating it entirely. They need not have done so. In Stenberg v.\r\n    Carhart, 530 U. S. 914\u2014where this Court invalidated Nevada\u2019s \u201cpar-\r\n    tial birth abortion\u201d law in its entirety for lacking a health exception\u2014\r\n    the parties did not ask for, and this Court did not contemplate, relief\r\n    more finely drawn, but here New Hampshire asked for and respon-\r\n    dents recognized the possibility of a more modest remedy. Only a few\r\n    applications of the Act would present a constitutional problem. So\r\n    long as they are faithful to legislative intent, then, in this case the\r\n    lower courts can issue a declaratory judgment and an injunction pro-\r\n    hibiting the Act\u2019s unconstitutional application. On remand, they\r\n    should determine in the first instance whether the legislature in-\r\n    tended the statute to be susceptible to such a remedy. Pp. 6\u201310.\r\n       (c) Because an injunction prohibiting unconstitutional applications\r\n    or a holding that consistency with legislative intent requires invali-\r\n    dating the statue in toto should obviate any concern about the Act\u2019s\r\n    life exception, this Court need not pass on the lower courts\u2019 alterna-\r\n    tive holding. If the Act survives in part on remand, the Court of Ap-\r\n    peals should address respondents\u2019 separate objection to the judicial\r\n                     Cite as: 546 U.

PLANNED\r\n      PARENTHOOD OF NORTHERN NEW\r\n               ENGLAND ET AL.\r\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\r\n             APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\r\n                              [January 18, 2006]\r\n\r\n   JUSTICE O\u2019CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\r\n   We do not revisit our abortion precedents today, but\r\nrather address a question of remedy: If enforcing a statute\r\nthat regulates access to abortion would be unconstitu-\r\ntional in medical emergencies, what is the appropriate\r\njudicial response? We hold that invalidating the statute\r\nentirely is not always necessary or justified, for lower\r\ncourts may be able to render narrower declaratory and\r\ninjunctive relief.\r\n                             I\r\n                            A\r\n   In 2003, New Hampshire enacted the Parental Notifica-\r\ntion Prior to Abortion Act.       N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann.\r\n\u00a7\u00a7132:24\u2013132:28 (Supp. 2004). The Act prohibits physi-\r\ncians from performing an abortion on a pregnant minor (or\r\na woman for whom a guardian or conservator has been\r\nappointed) until 48 hours after written notice of the pend-\r\ning abortion is delivered to her parent or guardian.\r\n\u00a7132:25(I). Notice may be delivered personally or by\r\n2     AYOTTE v. PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF NORTHERN \r\n\r\n                        NEW ENG.                             \r\n\r\n                    Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\ncertified mail. \u00a7\u00a7132:25(II), (III). Violations of the Act are\r\nsubject to criminal and civil penalties. \u00a7132:27.\r\n  The Act allows for three circumstances in which a phy-\r\nsician may perform an abortion without notifying the\r\nminor\u2019s parent. First, notice is not required if \u201c[t]he at-\r\ntending abortion provider certifies in the pregnant minor\u2019s\r\nrecord that the abortion is necessary to prevent the mi-\r\nnor\u2019s death and there is insufficient time to provide the\r\nrequired notice.\u201d \u00a7132:26(I)(a). Second, a person entitled\r\nto receive notice may certify that he or she has already\r\nbeen notified. \u00a7132:26(I)(b). Finally, a minor may petition\r\na judge to authorize her physician to perform an abortion\r\nwithout parental notification. The judge must so author-\r\nize if he or she finds that the minor is mature and capable\r\nof giving informed consent, or that an abortion without\r\nnotification is in the minor\u2019s best interests. \u00a7132:26(II).\r\nThese judicial bypass proceedings \u201cshall be confidential\r\nand shall be given precedence over other pending matters\r\nso that the court may reach a decision promptly and with-\r\nout delay,\u201d and access to the courts \u201cshall be afforded [to\r\nthe] pregnant minor 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\u201d\r\n\u00a7\u00a7132:26(II)(b), (c). The trial and appellate courts must\r\neach rule on bypass petitions within seven days. Ibid.\r\n  The Act does not explicitly permit a physician to per-\r\nform an abortion in a medical emergency without parental\r\nnotification.\r\n                             B\r\n  Respondents are Dr. Wayne Goldner, an obstetrician\r\nand gynecologist who has a private practice in Manches-\r\nter, and three clinics that offer reproductive health ser-\r\nvices. All provide abortions for pregnant minors, and each\r\nanticipates having to provide emergency abortions for\r\nminors in the future. Before the Act took effect, respon-\r\ndents brought suit under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, alleging that\r\nthe Act is unconstitutional because it fails \u201cto allow a\r\n                 Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)            3\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nphysician to provide a prompt abortion to a minor whose\r\nhealth would be endangered\u201d by delays inherent in the\r\nAct. App. 10 (Complaint, \u00b624). Respondents also chal-\r\nlenged the adequacy of the Act\u2019s life exception and of the\r\njudicial bypass\u2019 confidentiality provision.\r\n  The District Court declared the Act unconstitutional,\r\nsee 28 U. S. C. \u00a72201(a), and permanently enjoined its\r\nenforcement. It held, first, that the Act was invalid for\r\nfailure \u201con its face . . . to comply with the constitutional\r\nrequirement that laws restricting a woman\u2019s access to\r\nabortion must provide a health exception.\u201d Planned Par-\r\nenthood of Northern New Eng. v. Heed, 296 F. Supp. 2d 59,\r\n65 (NH 2003). It also found that the Act\u2019s judicial bypass\r\nwould not operate expeditiously enough in medical emer-\r\ngencies. In the alternative, the District Court held the\r\nAct\u2019s life exception unconstitutional because it requires\r\nphysicians to certify with impossible precision that an\r\nabortion is \u201cnecessary\u201d to avoid death, and fails to protect\r\ntheir good faith medical judgment.\r\n  The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed.\r\nCiting our decisions in Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U. S. 914,\r\n929\u2013930 (2000), Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v.\r\nCasey, 505 U. S. 833, 879 (1992) (plurality opinion), and\r\nRoe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 164\u2013165 (1973), it observed:\r\n\u201cComplementing the general undue burden standard [for\r\nreviewing abortion regulations], the Supreme Court has\r\nalso identified a specific and independent constitutional\r\nrequirement that an abortion regulation must contain an\r\nexception for the preservation of the pregnant woman\u2019s\r\nhealth.\u201d Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng. v.\r\nHeed, 390 F. 3d 53, 58 (2004). It went on to conclude that\r\nthe Act is unconstitutional because it does not contain an\r\nexplicit health exception, and its judicial bypass, along\r\nwith other provisions of state law, is no substitute. The\r\nCourt of Appeals further found the Act unconstitutional\r\nbecause, in its view, the life exception forces physicians to\r\n4      AYOTTE v. PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF NORTHERN \r\n\r\n                         NEW ENG.                                            \r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\ngamble with their patients\u2019 lives by prohibiting them from\r\nperforming an abortion without notification until they are\r\ncertain that death is imminent, and is intolerably vague.\r\nBecause the district and appellate courts permanently\r\nenjoined the Act\u2019s enforcement on the basis of the above\r\ninfirmities, neither reached respondents\u2019 objection to the\r\njudicial bypass\u2019 confidentiality provision.\r\n   We granted certiorari, 544 U. S. __ (2005), to decide\r\nwhether the courts below erred in invalidating the Act in\r\nits entirety because it lacks an exception for the preserva-\r\ntion of pregnant minors\u2019 health. We now vacate and re-\r\nmand for the Court of Appeals to reconsider its choice of\r\nremedy.\r\n                              II\r\n   As the case comes to us, three propositions\u2014two legal\r\nand one factual\u2014are established. First, States unques-\r\ntionably have the right to require parental involvement\r\nwhen a minor considers terminating her pregnancy, be-\r\ncause of their \u201cstrong and legitimate interest in the wel-\r\nfare of [their] young citizens, whose immaturity, inexperi-\r\nence, and lack of judgment may sometimes impair their\r\nability to exercise their rights wisely.\u201d Hodgson v.

S., at 444; see id., at 450\u2013451 and n. 36\r\n(holding unconstitutional a statute requiring notification of both\r\nparents, and observing that \u201cthe most common reason\u201d young women\r\ndid not notify a second parent was that the second parent \u201cwas a child-\r\nor spouse-batterer, and notification would have provoked further\r\nabuse\u201d (citation omitted)). See also Department of Health and Human\r\nServices, Administration on Children, Youth and Families, Child\r\nMaltreatment 2003, p. 63 (2005) (parents were the perpetrators in\r\n79.7% of cases of reported abuse or neglect).\r\n6      AYOTTE v. PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF NORTHERN \r\n\r\n                         NEW ENG.                            \r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\nprecedents hold, that a State may not restrict access to\r\nabortions that are \u201c \u2018necessary, in appropriate medical\r\njudgment, for preservation of the life or health of the\r\nmother.\u2019 \u201d Casey, 505 U. S., at 879 (plurality opinion) (quot-\r\ning Roe, 410 U. S., at 164\u2013165); see also Thornburgh v.\r\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476\r\nU. S. 747, 768\u2013769 (1986); Planned Parenthood Assn. of\r\nKansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U. S. 476, 482\u2013486\r\n(1983) (opinion of Powell, J.); Planned Parenthood of Cen-\r\ntral Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 79 (1976).\r\n   Third, New Hampshire has not taken real issue with the\r\nfactual basis of this litigation: In some very small percent-\r\nage of cases, pregnant minors, like adult women, need\r\nimmediate abortions to avert serious and often irreversible\r\ndamage to their health. See 296 F. Supp. 2d, at 65, n. 4.\r\n   New Hampshire has maintained that in most if not all\r\ncases, the Act\u2019s judicial bypass and the State\u2019s \u201ccompeting\r\nharms\u201d statutes should protect both physician and patient\r\nwhen a minor needs an immediate abortion. See N. H.\r\nRev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7627:3(I) (1996) (for criminal liability,\r\n\u201c[c]onduct which the actor believes to be necessary to\r\navoid harm to . . . another is justifiable if the desirability\r\nand urgency of avoiding such harm outweigh, according to\r\nordinary standards of reasonableness, the harm sought to\r\nbe prevented by the statute defining the offense charged\u201d);\r\n\u00a7627:1 (similar for civil liability). But the District Court\r\nand Court of Appeals found neither of these provisions to\r\nprotect minors\u2019 health reliably in all emergencies. 296\r\nF. Supp. 2d, at 65\u201366; 390 F. 3d, at 61\u201362. And New\r\nHampshire has conceded that, under our cases, it would be\r\nunconstitutional to apply the Act in a manner that sub-\r\njects minors to significant health risks. See Reply Brief\r\nfor Petitioner 2, 8, 11; Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 14.\r\n                           III\r\n    We turn to the question of remedy: When a statute\r\n                 Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)            7\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nrestricting access to abortion may be applied in a manner\r\nthat harms women\u2019s health, what is the appropriate relief?\r\nGenerally speaking, when confronting a constitutional\r\nflaw in a statute, we try to limit the solution to the prob-\r\nlem. We prefer, for example, to enjoin only the unconsti-\r\ntutional applications of a statute while leaving other\r\napplications in force, see United States v. Raines, 362 U. S.\r\n17, 20\u201322 (1960), or to sever its problematic portions while\r\nleaving the remainder intact, United States v. Booker, 543\r\nU. S. 220, 227\u2013229 (2005).\r\n   Three interrelated principles inform our approach to\r\nremedies. First, we try not to nullify more of a legisla-\r\nture\u2019s work than is necessary, for we know that \u201c[a] ruling\r\nof unconstitutionality frustrates the intent of the elected\r\nrepresentatives of the people.\u201d Regan v. Time, Inc., 468\r\nU. S. 641, 652 (1984) (plurality opinion). It is axiomatic\r\nthat a \u201cstatute may be invalid as applied to one state of\r\nfacts and yet valid as applied to another.\u201d Dahnke-Walker\r\nMilling Co. v. Bondurant, 257 U. S. 282, 289 (1921).\r\nAccordingly, the \u201cnormal rule\u201d is that \u201cpartial, rather than\r\nfacial, invalidation is the required course,\u201d such that a\r\n\u201cstatute may . . . be declared invalid to the extent that it\r\nreaches too far, but otherwise left intact.\u201d Brockett v.\r\nSpokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 504 (1985); see also\r\nTennessee v. Garner, 471 U. S. 1 (1985); United States v.\r\nGrace, 461 U. S. 171, 180\u2013183 (1983).\r\n   Second, mindful that our constitutional mandate and\r\ninstitutional competence are limited, we restrain ourselves\r\nfrom \u201crewrit[ing] state law to conform it to constitutional\r\nrequirements\u201d even as we strive to salvage it. Virginia v.\r\nAmerican Booksellers Assn., Inc., 484 U. S. 383, 397\r\n(1988). Our ability to devise a judicial remedy that does\r\nnot entail quintessentially legislative work often depends\r\non how clearly we have already articulated the back-\r\nground constitutional rules at issue and how easily we can\r\narticulate the remedy. In United States v. Grace, supra, at\r\n8     AYOTTE v. PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF NORTHERN \r\n\r\n                        NEW ENG.                           \r\n\r\n                    Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\n180\u2013183, for example, we crafted a narrow remedy much\r\nlike the one we contemplate today, striking down a statute\r\nbanning expressive displays only as it applied to public\r\nsidewalks near the Supreme Court but not as it applied to\r\nthe Supreme Court Building itself. We later explained\r\nthat the remedy in Grace was a \u201crelatively simple matter\u201d\r\nbecause we had previously distinguished between side-\r\nwalks and buildings in our First Amendment jurispru-\r\ndence. United States v. Treasury Employees, 513 U. S.\r\n454, 479, n. 26 (1995). But making distinctions in a\r\nmurky constitutional context, or where line-drawing is\r\ninherently complex, may call for a \u201cfar more serious inva-\r\nsion of the legislative domain\u201d than we ought to under-\r\ntake. Ibid.\r\n   Third, the touchstone for any decision about remedy is\r\nlegislative intent, for a court cannot \u201cuse its remedial\r\npowers to circumvent the intent of the legislature.\u201d Cali-\r\nfano v. Westcott, 443 U. S. 76, 94 (1979) (Powell, J., con-\r\ncurring in part and dissenting in part); see also Dorchy v.\r\nKansas, 264 U. S. 286, 289\u2013290 (1924) (opinion for the\r\nCourt by Brandeis, J.). After finding an application or\r\nportion of a statute unconstitutional, we must next ask:\r\nWould the legislature have preferred what is left of its\r\nstatute to no statute at all? See generally Booker, supra,\r\nat 227; Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indi-\r\nans, 526 U. S. 172, 191 (1999); Alaska Airlines, Inc. v.\r\nBrock, 480 U. S. 678, 684 (1987); Champlin Refining Co. v.\r\nCorporation Comm\u2019n of Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234 (1932);\r\nThe Employers\u2019 Liability Cases, 207 U. S. 463, 501 (1908);\r\nAllen v. Louisiana, 103 U. S. 80, 83\u201384 (1881); Trade-\r\nMark Cases, 100 U. S. 82, 97\u201398 (1879). All the while, we\r\nare wary of legislatures who would rely on our interven-\r\ntion, for \u201c[i]t would certainly be dangerous if the legisla-\r\nture could set a net large enough to catch all possible\r\noffenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside\u201d to\r\nannounce to whom the statute may be applied. United\r\n                  Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)            9\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nStates v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214, 221 (1876). \u201cThis would, to\r\nsome extent, substitute the judicial for the legislative\r\ndepartment of the government.\u201d Ibid.\r\n   In this case, the courts below chose the most blunt\r\nremedy\u2014permanently enjoining the enforcement of New\r\nHampshire\u2019s parental notification law and thereby invali-\r\ndating it entirely. That is understandable, for we, too,\r\nhave previously invalidated an abortion statute in its\r\nentirety because of the same constitutional flaw. In Sten-\r\nberg, we addressed a Nebraska law banning so-called\r\n\u201cpartial birth abortion\u201d unless the procedure was neces-\r\nsary to save the pregnant woman\u2019s life. We held Ne-\r\nbraska\u2019s law unconstitutional because it lacked a health\r\nexception. 530 U. S., at 930 (lack of a health exception\r\nwas an \u201cindependent reaso[n]\u201d for finding the ban uncon-\r\nstitutional). But the parties in Stenberg did not ask for,\r\nand we did not contemplate, relief more finely drawn.\r\n   In the case that is before us, however, we agree with\r\nNew Hampshire that the lower courts need not have in-\r\nvalidated the law wholesale. Respondents, too, recognize\r\nthe possibility of a modest remedy: They pleaded for any\r\nrelief \u201cjust and proper,\u201d App. 13 (Complaint), and conceded\r\nat oral argument that carefully crafted injunctive relief\r\nmay resolve this case, Tr. of Oral Arg. 38, 40. Only a few\r\napplications of New Hampshire\u2019s parental notification\r\nstatute would present a constitutional problem. So long as\r\nthey are faithful to legislative intent, then, in this case\r\nthe lower courts can issue a declaratory judgment and\r\nan injunction prohibiting the statute\u2019s unconstitutional\r\napplication.\r\n   There is some dispute as to whether New Hampshire\u2019s\r\nlegislature intended the statute to be susceptible to such a\r\nremedy. New Hampshire notes that the Act contains a\r\nseverability clause providing that \u201c[i]f any provision of this\r\nsubdivision or the application thereof to any person or\r\ncircumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall not\r\n10   AYOTTE v. PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF NORTHERN\r\n                       NEW ENG.\r\n                   Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\naffect the provisions or applications of this subdivision\r\nwhich can be given effect without the invalid provisions or\r\napplications.\u201d \u00a7132:28. Respondents, on the other hand,\r\ncontend that New Hampshire legislators preferred no\r\nstatute at all to a statute enjoined in the way we have\r\ndescribed. Because this is an open question, we remand\r\nfor the lower courts to determine legislative intent in the\r\nfirst instance.\r\n                             IV\r\n  Either an injunction prohibiting unconstitutional appli-\r\ncations or a holding that consistency with legislative\r\nintent requires invalidating the statute in toto should\r\nobviate any concern about the Act\u2019s life exception. We\r\ntherefore need not pass on the lower courts\u2019 alternative\r\nholding. Finally, if the Act does survive in part on re-\r\nmand, the Court of Appeals should address respondents\u2019\r\nseparate objection to the judicial bypass\u2019 confidentiality\r\nprovision. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is va-\r\ncated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\r\nconsistent with this opinion.\r\n                                          It is so ordered.\r\n",

We hold that invalidating the statute entirely is not always necessary or justified, for lower courts may be able to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In 2003, New Hampshire enacted the Parental Notification Prior to Abortion Act. N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 132:24-132:28 (2005). The Act prohibits physicians from performing an abortion on a pregnant minor (or a woman for whom a guardian or conservator has been appointed) until 48 hours after written notice of the pending abortion is delivered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*324</span> to her parent or guardian. \u00a7 132:25(I). Notice may be delivered personally or by certified mail. \u00a7\u00a7 132:25(II), (III). Violations of the Act are subject to criminal and civil penalties. \u00a7 132:27.</p>\n<p>The Act allows for three circumstances in which a physician may perform an abortion without notifying the minor's parent. First, notice is not required if \"[t]he attending abortion provider certifies in the pregnant minor's record that the abortion is necessary to prevent the minor's death and there is insufficient time to provide the required notice.\" \u00a7 132:26(I)(a). Second, a person entitled to receive notice may certify that he or she has already been notified. \u00a7 132:26(I)(b). Finally, a minor may petition a judge to authorize her physician to perform an abortion without parental notification. The judge must so authorize if he or she finds that the minor is mature and capable of giving informed consent, or that an abortion without notification is in the minor's best interests. \u00a7 132:26(II). These judicial bypass proceedings \"shall be confidential and shall be given precedence over other pending matters so that the court may reach a decision promptly and without delay,\" and access to the courts \"shall be afforded [to the] pregnant minor 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\" \u00a7\u00a7 132:26(II)(b), (c). The trial and appellate courts must each rule on bypass petitions within seven days. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Act does not explicitly permit a physician to perform an abortion in a medical emergency without parental notification.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Respondents are Dr. Wayne Goldner, an obstetrician and gynecologist who has a private practice in Manchester, and three clinics that offer reproductive health services. All provide abortions for pregnant minors, and each anticipates having to provide emergency abortions for minors in the future. Before the Act took effect, respondents brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that the Act is unconstitutional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*325</span> because it fails \"to allow a physician to provide a prompt abortion to a minor whose health would be endangered\" by delays inherent in the Act. App. 10 (Complaint, \u00b6 24). Respondents also challenged the adequacy of the Act's life exception and of the judicial bypass' confidentiality provision.</p>\n<p>The District Court declared the Act unconstitutional, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a), and permanently enjoined its enforcement. It held, first, that the Act was invalid for failure \"on its face [to] comply with the constitutional requirement that laws restricting a woman's access to abortion must provide a health exception.\" <i>Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng.</i> v. <i>Heed,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2295222\"><a href=\"/opinion/2295222/planned-parenthood-of-northern-new-england-v-heed/\"><span class=\"volume\">296</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 65 (NH 2003). It also found that the Act's judicial bypass would not operate expeditiously enough in medical emergencies. In the alternative, the District Court held the Act's life exception unconstitutional because it requires physicians to certify with impossible precision that an abortion is \"necessary\" to avoid death, and fails to protect their good faith medical judgment.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed. Citing our decisions in <i>Stenberg</i> v. <i>Carhart,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118387\"><a href=\"/opinion/118387/stenberg-v-carhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span>, 929-930 (2000), <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</i> v. <i>Casey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112786\"><a href=\"/opinion/112786/planned-parenthood-of-southeastern-pa-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span>, 879 (1992) (plurality opinion), and <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108713\"><a href=\"/opinion/108713/roe-v-wade/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span>, 164-165 (1973), it observed: \"Complementing the general undue burden standard [for reviewing abortion regulations], the Supreme Court has also identified a specific and independent constitutional requirement that an abortion regulation must contain an exception for the preservation of the pregnant woman's health.\" <i>Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng.</i> v. <i>Heed,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201353\"><a href=\"/opinion/201353/planned-parenthood-v-ayotte/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 58 (2004). It went on to conclude that the Act is unconstitutional because it does not contain an explicit health exception, and its judicial bypass, along with other provisions of state law, is no substitute. The Court of Appeals further found the Act unconstitutional because, in its view, the life exception forces physicians to gamble with their patients' <span class=\"star-pagination\">*326</span> lives by prohibiting them from performing an abortion without notification until they are certain that death is imminent, and is intolerably vague. Because the district and appellate courts permanently enjoined the Act's enforcement on the basis of the above infirmities, neither reached respondents' objection to the judicial bypass' confidentiality provision.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1048</span></span> (2005), to decide whether the courts below erred in invalidating the Act in its entirety because it lacks an exception for the preservation of pregnant minors' health. We now vacate and remand for the Court of Appeals to reconsider its choice of remedy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>As the case comes to us, three propositions\u0097two legal and one factual\u0097are established. First, States unquestionably have the right to require parental involvement when a minor considers terminating her pregnancy, because of their \"strong and legitimate interest in the welfare of [their] young citizens, whose immaturity, inexperience, and lack of judgment may sometimes impair their ability to exercise their rights wisely.\" <i>Hodgson</i> v. <i>Minnesota,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112481\"><a href=\"/opinion/112481/hodgson-v-minnesota/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span>, 444-445 (1990) (opinion of Stevens, J.).<sup>[1]</sup> Accordingly, we have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*327</span> long upheld state parental involvement statutes like the Act before us, and we cast no doubt on those holdings today. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Lambert</i> v. <i>Wicklund,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1088002\"><a href=\"/opinion/1088002/lambert-v-wicklund/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span> (1997) <i>(per curiam)</i>; <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 899 (joint opinion); <i>Ohio</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112482\"><a href=\"/opinion/112482/ohio-v-akron-center-for-reproductive-health/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>, 510-519 (1990); <i>Hodgson,</i> 497 U.S., at 461 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment in part); <i>id.,</i> at 497-501 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Second, New Hampshire does not dispute, and our precedents hold, that a State may not restrict access to abortions that are \"`necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.'\" <i>Casey,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*328</span> 505 U.S., at 879 (plurality opinion) (quoting <i>Roe,</i> 410 U.S., at 164-165); see also <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111690\"><a href=\"/opinion/111690/thornburgh-v-american-college-of-obstetricians-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">747</span></a></span>, 768-769 (1986); <i>Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc.</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110969\"><a href=\"/opinion/110969/planned-parenthood-assn-of-kansas-city-mo-inc-v-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span>, 482-486 (1983) (opinion of Powell, J.); <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109529\"><a href=\"/opinion/109529/planned-parenthood-of-central-mo-v-danforth/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 79 (1976).</p>\n<p>Third, New Hampshire has not taken real issue with the factual basis of this litigation: In some very small percentage of cases, pregnant minors, like adult women, need immediate abortions to avert serious and often irreversible damage to their health. See 296 F. Supp. 2d, at 65, n. 4.</p>\n<p>New Hampshire has maintained that in most if not all cases, the Act's judicial bypass and the State's \"competing harms\" statutes should protect both physician and patient when a minor needs an immediate abortion. See N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 627:3(I) (1996) (for criminal liability, \"[c]onduct which the actor believes to be necessary to avoid harm to . . . another is justifiable if the desirability and urgency of avoiding such harm outweigh, according to ordinary standards of reasonableness, the harm sought to be prevented by the statute defining the offense charged\"); \u00a7 627:1 (similar for civil liability). But the District Court and Court of Appeals found neither of these provisions to protect minors' health reliably in all emergencies. 296 F. Supp. 2d, at 65-66; 390 F.3d, at 61-62. And New Hampshire has conceded that, under our cases, it would be unconstitutional to apply the Act in a manner that subjects minors to significant health risks. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 2, 8, 11; Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 14.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>We turn to the question of remedy: When a statute restricting access to abortion may be applied in a manner that harms women's health, what is the appropriate relief? Generally speaking, when confronting a constitutional flaw in a statute, we try to limit the solution to the problem. We prefer, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*329</span> for example, to enjoin only the unconstitutional applications of a statute while leaving other applications in force, see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Raines,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106008\"><a href=\"/opinion/106008/united-states-v-james-griggs-raines/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 20-22 (1960), or to sever its problematic portions while leaving the remainder intact, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, 227-229 (2005).</p>\n<p>Three interrelated principles inform our approach to remedies. First, we try not to nullify more of a legislature's work than is necessary, for we know that \"[a] ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates the intent of the elected representatives of the people.\" <i>Regan</i> v. <i>Time, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111256\"><a href=\"/opinion/111256/regan-v-time-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span>, 652 (1984) (plurality opinion). It is axiomatic that a \"statute may be invalid as applied to one state of facts and yet valid as applied to another.\" <i>Dahnke-Walker Milling Co.</i> v. <i>Bondurant,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99884\"><a href=\"/opinion/99884/dahnke-walker-milling-co-v-bondurant/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span></a></span>, 289 (1921). Accordingly, the \"normal rule\" is that \"partial, rather than facial, invalidation is the required course,\" such that a \"statute may . . . be declared invalid to the extent that it reaches too far, but otherwise left intact.\" <i>Brockett</i> v. <i>Spokane Arcades, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111480\"><a href=\"/opinion/111480/brockett-v-spokane-arcades-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span>, 504 (1985); see also <i>Tennessee</i> v. <i>Garner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111397\"><a href=\"/opinion/111397/tennessee-v-garner/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1985); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Grace,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110918\"><a href=\"/opinion/110918/united-states-v-grace/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span>, 180-183 (1983).</p>\n<p>Second, mindful that our constitutional mandate and institutional competence are limited, we restrain ourselves from \"rewrit[ing] state law to conform it to constitutional requirements\" even as we strive to salvage it. <i>Virginia</i> v. <i>American Booksellers Assn., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111985\"><a href=\"/opinion/111985/virginia-v-american-booksellers-assn-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span>, 397 (1988). Our ability to devise a judicial remedy that does not entail quintessentially legislative work often depends on how clearly we have already articulated the background constitutional rules at issue and how easily we can articulate the remedy. In <i>United States</i> v. <i>Grace, supra,</i> at 180-183, for example, we crafted a narrow remedy much like the one we contemplate today, striking down a statute banning expressive displays only as it applied to public sidewalks near the Supreme Court but not as it applied to the Supreme Court Building itself. We later explained that the remedy in <i>Grace</i> was a \"relatively simple matter\" because we had previously distinguished <span class=\"star-pagination\">*330</span> between sidewalks and buildings in our First Amendment jurisprudence. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Treasury Employees,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117898\"><a href=\"/opinion/117898/united-states-v-national-treasury-employees-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span>, 479, n. 26 (1995). But making distinctions in a murky constitutional context, or where linedrawing is inherently complex, may call for a \"far more serious invasion of the legislative domain\" than we ought to undertake. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Third, the touchstone for any decision about remedy is legislative intent, for a court cannot \"use its remedial powers to circumvent the intent of the legislature.\" <i>Califano</i> v. <i>Westcott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110130\"><a href=\"/opinion/110130/califano-v-westcott/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span>, 94 (1979) (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); see also <i>Dorchy</i> v. <i>Kansas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100373\"><a href=\"/opinion/100373/dorchy-v-kansas/\"><span class=\"volume\">264</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span>, 289-290 (1924) (opinion for the Court by Brandeis, J.). After finding an application or portion of a statute unconstitutional, we must next ask: Would the legislature have preferred what is left of its statute to no statute at all? See generally <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 227; <i>Minnesota</i> v. <i>Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118273\"><a href=\"/opinion/118273/minnesota-v-mille-lacs-band-of-chippewa-indians/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span>, 191 (1999); <i>Alaska Airlines, Inc.</i> v. <i>Brock,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111847\"><a href=\"/opinion/111847/alaska-airlines-inc-v-brock/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></a></span>, 684 (1987); <i>Champlin Refining Co.</i> v. <i>Corporation Comm'n of Okla.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101918\"><a href=\"/opinion/101918/champlin-rfg-co-v-corporation-commission-of-oklaho/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span>, 234 (1932); <i>The Employers' Liability Cases,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96745\"><a href=\"/opinion/96745/the-employersliability-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">463</span></a></span>, 501 (1908); <i>Allen</i> v. <i>Louisiana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90302\"><a href=\"/opinion/90302/allen-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 83-84 (1881); <i>Trade-Mark Cases,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90017\"><a href=\"/opinion/90017/united-states-v-steffens/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span>, 97-98 (1879). All the while, we are wary of legislatures who would rely on our intervention, for \"[i]t would certainly be dangerous if the legislature could set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside\" to announce to whom the statute may be applied. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Reese,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"89266\"><a href=\"/opinion/89266/united-states-v-reese/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span>, 221 (1876). \"This would, to some extent, substitute the judicial for the legislative department of the government.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>In this case, the courts below chose the most blunt remedy \u0097permanently enjoining the enforcement of New Hampshire's parental notification law and thereby invalidating it entirely. That is understandable, for we, too, have previously <span class=\"star-pagination\">*331</span> invalidated an abortion statute in its entirety because of the same constitutional flaw. In <i>Stenberg,</i> we addressed a Nebraska law banning so-called \"partial birth abortion\" unless the procedure was necessary to save the pregnant woman's life. We held Nebraska's law unconstitutional because it lacked a health exception. 530 U.S., at 930 (lack of a health exception was an \"independent reaso[n]\" for finding the ban unconstitutional). But the parties in <i>Stenberg</i> did not ask for, and we did not contemplate, relief more finely drawn.</p>\n<p>In the case that is before us, however, we agree with New Hampshire that the lower courts need not have invalidated the law wholesale. Respondents, too, recognize the possibility of a modest remedy: They pleaded for any relief \"just and proper,\" App. 13 (Complaint), and conceded at oral argument that carefully crafted injunctive relief may resolve this case, Tr. of Oral Arg. 38, 40. Only a few applications of New Hampshire's parental notification statute would present a constitutional problem. So long as they are faithful to legislative intent, then, in this case the lower courts can issue a declaratory judgment and an injunction prohibiting the statute's unconstitutional application.</p>\n<p>There is some dispute as to whether New Hampshire's legislature intended the statute to be susceptible to such a remedy. New Hampshire notes that the Act contains a severability clause providing that \"[i]f any provision of this subdivision or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the provisions or applications of this subdivision which can be given effect without the invalid provisions or applications.\" \u00a7 132:28. Respondents, on the other hand, contend that New Hampshire legislators preferred no statute at all to a statute enjoined in the way we have described. Because this is an open question, we remand for the lower courts to determine legislative intent in the first instance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*332</span> IV</h2>\n<p>Either an injunction prohibiting unconstitutional applications or a holding that consistency with legislative intent requires invalidating the statute <i>in toto</i> should obviate any concern about the Act's life exception. We therefore need not pass on the lower courts' alternative holding. Finally, if the Act does survive in part on remand, the Court of Appeals should address respondents' separate objection to the judicial bypass' confidentiality provision. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for the State of Texas et al. by <i>Greg Abbott,</i> Attorney General of Texas, <i>Barry R.
